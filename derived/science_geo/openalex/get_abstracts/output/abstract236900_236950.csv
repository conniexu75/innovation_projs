https://openalex.org/W2161180058,"The gene mutated in ataxia telangiectasia, ATM, has been implicated in several cell functions such as cell cycle control and response to DNA damage and insulin. PKB/Akt has also been implicated in the cellular response to insulin, γ-radiation, and cell cycle control. Interestingly, lack of PKB/Akt function in vivo is able to mimic some phenotypic abnormalities associated with ataxia telangiectasia (AT). Here we show that ATM is a major determinant of full PKB/Akt activation in response to insulin or γ-radiation. This effect is mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain of ATM that specifically affects Akt serine 473 phosphorylation. This conclusion was inferred from the results obtained in transient transfection assays using exogenous PKB/Akt and ATM in Cos cells. Moreover, the use of ATM inhibitors or small interfering RNA confirmed our observation. Further supporting these results, we also observed that biological responses tightly regulated by Akt, such as transcription factor of the forkhead family activity after insulin treatment or γ-radiation response, were altered in cell lines derived from AT patients and knockout mice for ATM in which phosphorylation in serine 473 was almost abolished. This study proposes new clues in the search of the unknown PDK2 and new explanations for the radiosensitivity or insulin intolerance described more than 30 years ago in AT patients.

Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) 1The abbreviations used are: AT, ataxia telangiectasia; KO, knockout; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; HA, hemagglutinin, GST, glutathione S-transferase; wt, wild type; GFP, green fluorescence protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DKO, double knockout; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; aa, amino acid(s); FKHR, transcription factor of the forkhead family. is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth retardation, cerebellar ataxia, cancer susceptibility, oculotaneus telangiectasia, severe immunodeficiency, resistance to insulin, and hypersensitivity to γ-radiation, among other symptoms (for review, see Ref. 1Spacey S.D. Gatti R.A. Bebb G. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 2000; 27: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, the role of the gene mutated in ataxia telangiectasia, ATM, includes a wide spectrum of biological processes including cell cycle control, genome stability, apoptotic machinery, response to genotoxic stress, and others (2Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 3Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 4Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F.

The protein encoded by the ATM gene belongs to the superfamily of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) due to the presence of a p110-like domain, but no lipid kinase activity has been demonstrated so far (6Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This domain is responsible for the phosphorylation of proteins such as p53, ChK1, 4EBP, and BRCA1 following a conserved domain -S/T-Q- in which S or T is the phospho-acceptor residue (for a review, see Ref. 7Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In fact, regulation of ATM is mediated by autophosphorylation in residue Ser1981, at the FAT domain following this conserved motif, as has been demonstrated recently (8Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). The PKB/Akt protein, now referred to henceforth as Akt, plays a key role in a pathway related to survival by inhibition of apoptotic signals and promotion of cell cycle progression, with a clear implication in cancer and other pathologies (9Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 10Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Also, Akt has been shown to be potently activated in response to a wide variety of growth factors, such as insulin or insulin-like growth factor I, and, more recently, in response to DNA damage (11Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar, 12Brognard J. Clark A.S. Ni Y. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3986-3997PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation in two residues seems to be critical to total Akt activation: Thr308 mediated through PDK1, and Ser473 mediated by a yet unknown protein called PDK2 (13Chan, T. O., and Tsichlis, P. N. (2001) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/66/pe1Google Scholar). Although several candidates have been proposed, including the PDK1 itself (14Rane M.J.

Interestingly, these two apparent independent signal transduction pathways, ATM and Akt, seem to converge at a physiological level in response to stimuli such as insulin or γ-radiation. Furthermore, knockout (KO) models for Akt and ATM showed similarities in terms of phenotypic abnormalities such as growth retardation, defects in the maturation of the immune system, infertility, resistance to insulin, or radiosensitivity (20Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyanage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T. Tagle D. Wynshaw-Boris A.

We undertook the present study to explore the existence of a possible link between these two proteins and whether the connection could explain some of the biological properties such as radiosensitivity or insulin resistance observed in AT disease. Cell Lines—GM00637, GM09607, and GM08391 were purchased from Coriell Institute for Biomedical Research (Camden, NJ). Murine embryo fibroblast-derived cell lines from knockout animals for p53 (p53–/–, ATM+/+), referred to as KO p53, and double knockout for p53 and ATM (p53–/–, ATM–/–), referred to as DKO, were kindly supplied by Dr. Philip Leder (Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). 293T, IMR90, and Cos7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. DNA and Transfections—FLAG-His6 ATM wt in PEBS7-YZ5 was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Shiloh (School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel). FLAG-His6 ATM wt and kinase dead (kd) form in PCDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. M. B. Kastan (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). Green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged p53 was obtained from pEF1-p53-WT (23Sanchez-Prieto R. Rojas J.M. Taya Y. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2464-2472PubMed Google Scholar) and then subcloned into the BamHI/NotI site of pCEFL-GFP. His6-tagged p110α wt was kindly supplied by Dr. S. Gutkind (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). 293T cells were transfected using standard techniques of calcium phosphate. Cos, double KO, and GM09607 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. In the case of stably transfected cells, cells were selected with appropriate dose of hygromicin (Roche Applied Science). In transient transfection assays, cells were collected 48 h after transfection. FKHR wt, mutant, and reporter for FKHR activity were kindly supplied by Dr. L del Peso (Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) p53 wt has been described previously (23Sanchez-Prieto R. Rojas J.M. Taya Y. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2464-2472PubMed Google Scholar). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Akt wt and triple mutant (residues 473, 308, and 179) in pCMV5 were kindly supplied by Dr. D. Alessi (Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation Unit, Dundee, United Kingdom). Antibodies, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitation Procedures— Specific phospho-antibodies against Ser473 or Thr308 of Akt and phospho-ERK1/2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA), and antibody against total Akt and ERK1 (IR-α) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Akt kinase assays were performed using a nonradioactive kit from Cell Signaling Technologies following the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against HA and GFP were from Covance (Richmond, CA) and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Antibody against His6 and FLAG was from Sigma. Cells for Akt phosphorylation assays were treated and collected in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 20 mm B-glycerophosphate) in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm NaPPi), and protein quantity was quantified by using a Bio-Rad assay. Cells for co-immunoprecipitation assays were collected in HNTG lysis buffer (23Sanchez-Prieto R. Rojas J.M. Taya Y. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2464-2472PubMed Google Scholar). Then, lysates were processed for Western blotting (usually 50 μg) or immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies and protein G (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocomplexes were extensively washed and resuspended in 5× sample buffer. Antibody detection was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). PCR Protocols and Generation of GST Fusion Proteins—The primers and protocol for cloning the PI3K domain from Y5Z DNA have been described previously (24Morgan S.E. Lovly C. Pandita T.K. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2020-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned onto pEF1/His-C (Invitrogen). DNA was confirmed by automatic sequencing. To generate GST-Akt protein with the last 80 aa of Akt, we used as a template pCVM5-HA-Akt forward primer 5′-GGGGGATCCTTCTTTGCCGGTATCGTG-3′, which contains a BamHI site, and the reverse primer 5′-CCCGCGGCCGCTCAGGCCGTGCTGCTGGC-3′, which contains a NotI site. PCR was performed using pfu Turbo DNA polymerase from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) for 35 cycles (denaturation, 95 °C, 1 min; annealing, 60 °C, 2 min; extension, 72 °C, 3 min) and a final extension cycle of 10 min. The PCR product was subcloned into PGX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) in the BamHI and NotI site. Positive constructs were tested for expression after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) treatment in BL21(DE3) bacteria (Invitrogen). DNA was confirmed by automatic sequencing. GST p53 wt has been described previously (23Sanchez-Prieto R. Rojas J.M. Taya Y. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2464-2472PubMed Google Scholar). All GST fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) harboring the corresponding plasmid, following the method described previously. GST-Akt and GST-p53 were used in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Treatments—Insulin was from Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). Cells were treated for 30 min with the indicated dose. Cells were γ-irradiated using a cobalt source (Theratron 780 AECL) at an SSD of 57 cm at a dose rate of 285 cGy/min. Cells were kept at 37 °C in 5% CO2 immediately after γ-radiation for 7 days in viability assays or 30 min in kinase assays. Cells were pretreated for 1 h with either 200 nm wortmannin (Sigma), 20 μm Ly294002 (Cell Signaling Technology), or 2 mm caffeine (Sigma) in the cases indicated. Luciferase Assay—Reporter assays for FKHR were performed as described previously (25del Peso L. Gonzalez V.M. Hernandez R. Barr F.G. Nunez G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7328-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected in a 24-well plate, starved overnight, and then incubated with or without insulin (10 nm) for 18 h. In the case of ATM wt overexpression, we used 1.5 μg of plasmid coding for ATM wt. Extracts were collected in Promega Lysys buffer, and samples were measured using a luminometer (Dynex). Luciferase activity was normalized with Renilla control (Promega). In Vitro Kinase Assay for ATM—The kinase reaction for ATM activity was performed as described previously (26Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar), except that we used as a substrate GST-p53 (80 aa) or GST-Akt (80 aa) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads or the immunocomplex from Cos cells transfected with HA-tagged Akt wt. RNA Interference Assays—Silencer validated small interfering RNA (siRNA) for ATM was obtained from Ambion. Transfection of siRNA was performed with Lipofectamine as described before. Cells were treated with insulin after overnight starving, 24–36 h after transfection. Overexpression of ATM Promotes Ser473 Phosphorylation of Akt through the PI3K Domain—To assess the possible link between Akt and ATM, we first overexpressed exogenous tagged ATM and Akt in Cos cells. Overexpression of FLAG-His6-tagged ATM wt induced phosphorylation in Ser473 of Akt in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas FLAG-His6-tagged ATM kd was not able to do so. However, in residue Thr308 of Akt, we observed only a slight increase (faint band in Fig. 1a). As a control for Akt and ATM activity, we used insulin and Ser15 phosphorylation of p53 protein, respectively (27Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 28Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). In fact, PI3K inhibitors, such as wortmannin, Ly294002, or caffeine, were able to block ATM-mediated Akt Ser473 phosphorylation (Fig. 1b). To confirm this observation, an Akt kinase assay was performed, and we observed that ATM wt induced Akt kinase activity following a dose-dependent kinetic, whereas we did not detect any effect in the presence of ATM kd (Fig. 1c). In this sense, kinase activity in Thr308 mutant Akt after mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 in vitro phosphorylation of Ser473 residue has been reported, indicating that Ser473 activation can render kinase activity by itself, supporting our observations (11Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Interestingly, γ-radiation, a classical ATM stimulus, was also able to induce Akt kinase activity (Fig. 1c). However, all the previous experiments were performed by overexpression of ATM or using chemical inhibitors known to block PI3K also implicated in Akt activation. Therefore, we decided to specifically inhibit ATM using RNA interference technology. Cos cells were transfected with exogenous ATM in the presence of increasing amounts of validated siRNA for ATM (ranging from 0 to 400 nm), and ATM expression was monitored (Fig. 1d, top panel). Then, we performed the same experiment with endogenous ATM stimulated with insulin in the presence of HA-tagged Akt (Fig. 1d, bottom panel). Whereas a marked decrease was observed in Ser473 phosphorylation, no effect was detected in Thr308. The same experiment was performed in HeLa cells with exactly the same results (data not shown).Fig. 1ATM mediates Akt Ser473 phosphorylation through the PI3K domain in Cos cells. a, transient transfection in Cos cells introducing increasing amounts (1–3 μg) of FLAG-His6 ATM and 1 μg of HA-Akt or GFP-p53. Antibodies against the phosphorylated form of Akt in Thr308 or Ser473 were used to detect Akt activation. Total Akt was used as a loading control. Phosphorylation of Ser15 of p53 was used as a control of ATM functionality. ATM expression was detected with anti-FLAG. As a positive control, HA-Akt was stimulated with insulin (100 nm) for 20 min, and GFP-p53 was γ-irradiated (20 Gy) for 30 min. b, transient transfection in Cos cells introducing increasing amounts (1–3 μg) of FLAG-His6 ATM and 1 μg of HA-Akt in the presence of the following PI3K inhibitors: 200 nm wortmannin, 20 μm Ly294002, and 2 mm caffeine. c, Cos cells were transfected with increasing amounts (1 μg) of FLAG-His6 ATM wt or kd plus 1 μg of HA-Akt. Kinase assay was performed to detect Akt activity using GST-GSK3 as a substrate. As a positive control, HA-Akt-transfected cells were treated with insulin (100 nm) for 20 min (left panel). Transfected HA-Akt (1 μg) is activated in γ-irradiated (20 Gy, 30 min) Cos cells (right panel). d, increasing concentrations (0–400 nm) of siRNA were co-transfected in Cos cells with 1 μg of ATM. Expression of ATM was evaluated by Western blot, and as a control, we measured endogenous Akt (top panel). The fold change of ATM expression was estimated by densitometric analysis of filters. The values (given in arbitrary units) were normalized, taking into consideration the ATM protein levels obtained without siRNA as determined by immunoblot analysis. Results show one representative blot of three. The same amounts of siRNA were co-transfected in Cos cells with 0.5 μg of HA-Akt. Cells were treated with insulin (100 nm) for 20 min when indicated. HA-Akt was immunoprecipitated, and phosphorylation status of HA-Akt was analyzed (bottom panel). e, the His6-tagged PI3K (1 and 3 μg) domain of ATM was co-transfected with HA-Akt or GFP-p53 (1 μg) in Cos cells. Wortmannin (200 nm) was used to inhibit the PI3K domain of ATM. Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 or p53 at Ser15 was evaluated. f, 1 μg of HA-Akt was co-transfected in Cos cells with 3 μg of FLAG-His6 ATM wt, or the PI3K domain of ATM, or p110α or treated with insulin for 20 min. The fold change of activation was estimated by densitometric analysis of filters. The values (given in arbitrary units) were normalized, taking into consideration the Akt protein levels of each sample as determined by immunoblot analysis. Results show one representative blot of three.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the implication of the PI3K domain of ATM in Ser473 phosphorylation, we decided to PCR clone this domain, which is known to mediate some of the biological properties of ATM such as radiosensitivity (24Morgan S.E. Lovly C. Pandita T.K. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2020-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged PI3K domain from ATM was also able to induce Ser473 and Ser15 phosphorylation of Akt and p53, respectively, in a dose-dependent fashion inhibited by wortmannin (Fig. 1e). Expression of the PI3K domain of ATM was evaluated by Western blotting anti-His6 tag (data not shown). However, p110α, the catalytic subunit of the conventional PI3K, was able to induce phosphorylation in both Akt residues, suggesting a clear difference between these two PI3K families (Fig. 1f). ATM Binds to Akt and Mediates Ser473 Akt Phosphorylation—To gain further insight into the molecular mechanism of Akt activation mediated by ATM, we decided to investigate the possibility of a physical interaction between ATM and Akt. Therefore, 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-Akt plus FLAG-His6-tagged ATM wt or kd. Extracts were immunoprecipitated against His6 and blotted against HA. A clear binding between the two molecules was detected, demonstrating that both ATM wt and ATM kd were associated in vivo with HA-Akt (Fig. 2a). In addition, we decided to analyze the phosphorylation status of Akt bound to ATM; we observed that it was only phosphorylated at Ser473, whereas no signal was detected in Thr308 (Fig 2a). As a positive control, GFP-p53 was co-transfected with ATM, and we detected binding and p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 (Fig. 2b). In this scenario, we decided to analyze the possibility of direct phosphorylation in Ser473 of Akt, a putative phospho-acceptor in the ATM phosphorylation consensus site, although it is not followed by a Q (7Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In this context, and as a first approach, we decided to use the whole molecule as a substrate. Thus, HA-tagged Akt wt and a triple mutant in positions 473, 308, and 179 were transfected in Cos cells, immunoprecipitated, and used as a substrate for in vitro kinase assay using ATM immunoprecipitated from 293T cells. In this case, 32P incorporation was detected in the presence of the ATM wt form, whereas we did not detect any signal using the mutant forms of ATM or Akt (Fig. 2c). However, this experiment did not allow us to conclude that serine 473 is the target of ATM kinase activity. Therefore, we decided to generate two GST fusion proteins containing the last 80 aa of Akt, a wt form and a mutant form in which Ser473 was changed to Ala. Both GST fusion proteins were used as substrate for in vitro ATM kinase assays. Unfortunately, we did not detect any incorporation of phosphate (Fig. 2d). To assess the reliability of this approach, we used, under the same conditions, a GST containing the first 80 aa of p53 and a mutant form with Ser15 changed to Ala, which behaved as a specific substrate of ATM (Fig. 2d). Cell Lines from AT Patients or KO Mice Are Defective in Akt Ser473 Phosphorylation in Response to Insulin—To confirm our previous biochemical observations, we moved to an experimental model such as the cell line GM08931 (fibroblast derived from an AT patient), and we used IMR90 as a control. Cells were starved overnight and treated with insulin, and Akt phosphorylation in Ser473 was evaluated. Cells lacking ATM protein showed a clear decrease in phosphorylation of Ser473 with respect to the control cell line IMR90 (Fig. 3a). However, genetic backgrounds could be extremely different between IMR90 and GM08391, so we decided to use another cell line from an AT patient and the closed normal counterpart, GM09607(–/–) and GM00637(–/+). Again, exact results were obtained in terms of Ser473 phosphorylation, with no differences in Thr308 (Fig. 3b). To assess whether the differences observed were specifically due to lack of ATM expression, we transfected ATM wt in ATM-deficient cells (GM09607). As expected, Ser473 phosphorylation was restored in the cell line overexpressing ectopic ATM wt (Fig. 3b). To exclude the possibility that the insulin receptor or intermediate molecules were affected in these ATM-deficient cells, we measured the levels of the insulin receptor and the functionality of the pathway. No differences were observed in level of expression for the insulin receptor (Fig. 3c) or in terms of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (Fig. 3b). However, all of our previous observations could be due to a different specific response in our experimental models (two cell lines with different backgrounds with respect to their control). Therefore, we decided to use a biological model with identical genetic background such as murine embryo fibroblasts from ATM KO mice (30Westphal C.H. Rowan S. Schmaltz C. Elson A. Fisher D.E. Leder P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Again, exact results were obtained in terms of Akt phosphorylation, functionality of the pathway, and expression of the insulin receptor (Fig. 4, a and b). In fact, restoration of ATM expression was able to render phosphorylation in Ser473 (Fig. 4, a and b). To evaluate the biological implication of ATM in insulin-dependent Akt activation, we decided to check a specific target of Akt on insulin stimulation such as FKHR inhibition (25del Peso L. Gonzalez V.M. Hernandez R. Barr F.G. Nunez G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7328-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 31Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). We used a transcriptional system in which luciferase expression was under the control of six FKHR response elements. As expected, the inhibitory effect mediated by Akt activation was clearly diminished in ATM-null cells (45% less than the ATM-expressing cells) (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, overexpression of ATM rendered an almost complete block of FKHR activity in both cell systems (Fig. 4c). As a control, we used a mutant form of FKHR in Akt phosphorylation sites, in which no inhibitory effects were detected by insulin or ATM expression (data not shown). Defective Akt Activation Correlates with AT-associated Radiosensitivity—However, the use of only one stimulus, insulin, could not allow us to propose a general mechanism in which ATM is controlling Akt activity. Therefore, we challenged another very well-established stimulus for ATM that is also able to activate Akt, γ-radiation (Fig. 1c). γ-Irradiated GM09607 and GM00637 cells were analyzed for Akt activity using an in vitro kinase assay. Lack of Akt activity was detected in AT cells correlating with a sensitive phenotype and reversed by overexpression of ectopic ATM wt (Fig. 5a). Exact results were obtained in the model derived from KO cells (Fig. 5b). In this report, we demonstrate that ATM is implicated in Akt Ser473 phosphorylation and that its PI3K domain is necessary for this effect. Also, our results show how Akt and ATM may originate an in vivo complex without an apparent direct phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 by ATM, suggesting the existence of other proteins that directly phosphorylate Ser473 Akt. However, it is important to note that although ATM did not phosphorylate a small GST fusion protein containing the last 80 aa of Akt, the whole molecule renders the opposite results. This apparent contradiction can be explained by the lack of conformational requirements in the small GST fusion protein or by the presence of a third enzymatic activity in the whole Akt immunoprecipitated. Our data with the GST fusion protein containing the last 80 aa of p53 or Akt, the low level of phosphorylation in the immunoprecipitated Akt versus the GST of p53, and the lack of a consensus site for ATM phosphorylation in Akt strongly suggest an indirect mechanism of phosphorylation. Nonetheless, these data provide evidence for a new role for ATM that is controlling the unknown PDK2 protein, supporting the existence of a PDK2 activity that is sensitive to PI3K inhibitors but not to staurosporine (16Hodgkinson C.P. Sale E.M. Sale G.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10351-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr.

Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and exclude any dependence between Ser473 and Thr308 Akt phosphorylation. The use of KO cells for ATM and cell lines derived from patients, in addition to our prior observation in Cos cells using siRNA for ATM that excludes a compensatory mechanism, supports a physiological role for ATM in insulin-mediated Akt activation. AT patients are insulin-resistant, and KO mice for Akt develop resistance to insulin (21Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw E.B. II I Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Therefore, insulin resistance in AT patients can be partially explained by the lack of Ser473 phosphorylation, lack of full Akt activity, and the subsequent decrease in downstream targets, such as FKHR. Therefore, we propose that resistance to insulin in AT patients could be the result of deregulation of several mechanisms controlled by ATM, such as lack of 4EBPI (32Yang D.Q. Kastan M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and Akt activity. Radiosensitivity, the classical hallmark of AT, can be explained by lack of Akt activity, as has been observed in Akt1-deficient mice (22Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), whereas hyperactivation has been related to resistance (12Brognard J. Clark A.S. Ni Y. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3986-3997PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the increase in the G2-M checkpoint after γ-radiation in AT cells (33Xu B. Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) is probably due to the low activity of Akt, which is a key protein in the control and transition of the G2-M checkpoint after DNA damage (34Kandel E.S. Skeen J. Majewski N. Cristofano DiA. Pandolfi P.P. Feliciano C.S. Gartel A. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7831-7841Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We propose a model in which Akt activation by γ-radiation is controlled mainly by ATM and probably by other molecules in a p110-independent fashion, as has been demonstrated previously in squamous cell carcinoma (35Singh B. Reddy P.G. Goberdhan A. Walsh C. Dao S. Ngai I. Chou T.C. O-Charoenrat P. Levine A.J. Rao P.H. Stoffel A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 984-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Our data using the PI3K domain from ATM support the existence of two types of PI3K: (a) the conventional one, which is able to control phosphorylation of Akt in Thr308 and Ser473 but probably without an important role in DNA damage; and (b) the second one (represented here by ATM), which is able to control Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 6). Furthermore, other biological properties associated with ATM dysfunction, such as hypogonadism or growth retardation, fit perfectly with the link observed between ATM protein and Akt activity, as has been observed in KO mice for Akt1 (22Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). With regard to the mechanism of Akt activation mediated by ATM, it is noteworthy that recent evidence suggests that ATM is a downstream effector of Akt through the novel kinase ARK5 (36Suzuki A. Kusakai G.I. Kishimoto A. Lu J. Ogura T. Lavin M.F. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48-53Google Scholar). The role proposed for ARK5 is based only on biochemical evidence after glucose depletion, with no physiological implications. However, our data re-expressing ATM wt in ATM-null cells, the use of specific siRNA for ATM, and the biochemical response observed after insulin or γ-radiation (two well-known stimuli for ATM activation) demonstrate that ATM is a major upstream activator of Akt through control of Ser473 phosphorylation. Interestingly, no evidence has been reported showing that lack of Akt affects ATM activity. Nevertheless, a possible feedback loop of regulation between ATM and Akt also could be considered (Fig. 6). Furthermore, another member of the Pl3K superfamily extremely close to ATM and also implicated in the stress response (37Abraham R.T. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), DNA-PK, has been recently proposed as the unknown PDK2 (38Feng J. Park J. Cron P. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41189-41196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), supporting the role of this type of PI3K member in the control of Ser473 phosphorylation. In fact, the functional convergence of these two proteins, DNA-PK and ATM, in the control of Akt is a possibility, as has been demonstrated for c-Abl or H2AX phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation (39Shangary S. Brown K.D. Adamson A.W. Edmonson S. Ng B. Pandita T.K. Yalowich J. Taccioli G.E. Baskaran R. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2390-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Thus, as a major conclusion, the results shown here constitute the first evidence of a novel function of ATM as a main upstream activator of Akt activity through the control exerted on Ser473 phosphorylation, suggesting a mechanistic model for some of the biological symptoms of AT disease, such as radiosensitivity or resistance to insulin. Whether this model is applicable or not in other contexts is currently being studied, as is the identification of the putative proteins that might interact with and regulate the ATM-Akt signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2013317908,"In myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1), aggregation of the mutant DMPK RNA into RNA-protein complexes containing MBNL1 and MBNL2 has been linked to aberrant splicing of the insulin receptor (IR) RNA. In a parallel line of investigation, elevated levels of CUG-binding protein (CUG-BP) have been shown to result in altered IR splicing in DM1. The relative importance of MBNL1, MBNL2, and CUG-BP in DM1 pathogenesis is, however, unclear. Here we have demonstrated that either small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of MBNL1 and MBNL2 or the overexpression of CUG-BP in normal myoblasts results in abnormal IR splicing. Our results suggest that CUG-BP regulates the equilibrium of splice site selection by antagonizing the facilitatory activity of MBNL1 and MBNL2 on IR exon 11 splicing in a dose-dependent manner. We have shown that CUG-BP levels are elevated in DM1 cells by mechanisms that are independent of MBNL1 and MBNL2 loss. Importantly, rescue experiments in DM1 myoblasts demonstrated that loss of MBNL1 function is the key event, whereas the overexpression of CUG-BP plays a secondary role in the aberrant alternative splicing of IR RNA in DM1. Small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of MBNL1, MBNL2, and CUG-BP in DM1 myoblasts demonstrated that MBNL1 plays a critical role in the maintenance of DM1 focus integrity. Thus, these experiments demonstrate that sequestration of MBNL1 by the expanded CUG repeats is the primary determinant of both DM1 focus formation and the abnormal splicing of the IR RNA in DM1 myoblasts. The data therefore support MBNL1-mediated therapy for DM1."
https://openalex.org/W2008443903,"Nitric oxide produced by activated macrophages plays a key role as one of the immune system's weapons against pathogens. Because the lifetime of nitric oxide is short in aerobic conditions, whereas in anaerobic conditions the cytotoxic effects of nitric oxide are greatly increased as in the infection/inflammation processes, it is important to establish which systems are able to detoxify nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions. In the present work a new set of Escherichia coli K-12 genes conferring anaerobic resistance to nitric oxide is presented, namely the gene product of YtfE and a potential transcriptional regulator of the helix-turn-helix LysR-type (YidZ). The crucial role of flavohemoglobin for anaerobic nitric oxide protection is also demonstrated. Furthermore, nitric oxide is shown to cause a significant alteration of the global E. coli gene transcription profile that includes the increase of the transcript level of genes encoding for detoxification enzymes, iron-sulfur cluster assembly systems, DNA-repairing enzymes, and stress response regulators.

Macrophages are important weapons of host innate immunity, exhibiting a panoply of concerted strategies for microbial elimination. These strategies include the creation of an environment hostile to bacteria proliferation caused by, among other factors, the production of small diffusible reactive molecules such as nitric oxide (NO). 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; Fur, ferric uptake regulator; RCMNS, regulator of cell morphology and NO signaling.1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; Fur, ferric uptake regulator; RCMNS, regulator of cell morphology and NO signaling. The NO released by eukaryotes is a product of the enzymatic oxidation of l-arginine by NO synthases, and it regulates a plethora of important processes such as signaling, neuronal communication, vasodilatation, smooth muscle relaxation, and inhibition of platelet aggregation. However, these functions are achieved by using low amounts of NO and, once the concentration of NO rises above micromolar levels, the molecule becomes harmful and causes serious deleterious effects, namely tissue inflammation, chronic infection, malignant transformations, and degenerative diseases. Nevertheless, high concentrations of NO are used to fight invading prokaryotic pathogens and parasites. The NO released by macrophages is not the only source of NO that microbes need to deal with, because this compound is also produced abiotically (e.g. by decomposition of nitrite) and biotically by denitrifiers/ammonifiers or other bacteria (1Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000Google Scholar).Like all living organisms, bacteria have the ability to respond to aggression by developing a series of not yet fully understood mechanisms that include damage repair, eliciting the SOS system, resistance increase, and use of virulence as a counteracting tactic. Apart from the microbial membrane-bound heme-iron NO reductases, the cytoplasmatic globins, the flavodiiron NO reductases, and the multiheme nitrite reductases (2Saraiva L.M. Vicente J.B. Teixeira M. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2004; 49: 77-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) are also proposed to metabolize NO. Escherichia coli contains these three proteins: (i) the flavorubredoxin NorV, a flavodiiron NO reductase (3Gomes C.M. Giuffre A. Forte E. Vicente J.B. Saraiva L.M. Brunori M. Teixeira M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25273-25276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the discovery of which allowed the identification of similar enzymes in a large number of prokaryotic and protozoan genomes (4Andersson J.O. Sjogren A.M. Davis L.A. Embley T.M. Roger A.J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 94-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); (ii) the flavohemoglobin HmpA (5Poole R.K. Hughes M.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar); and (iii) the pentaheme nitrite reductase NrfA (6Poock S.R. Leach E.R. Moir J.W. Cole J.A. Richardson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23664-23669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Other E. coli systems are already known to respond to nitrosative stress, such as the SoxRS regulon. NO binds to the binuclear center of SoxR, forming a dinitrosyl-iron-dithiol active complex that induces soxS. SoxRS mutants were found to increase the sensitivity of E. coli to NO produced by macrophages (7Demple B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The presence of NO was shown to cause the formation of an iron-nitrosyl species in the E. coli Fur (ferric uptake regulator), leading to the inactivation of its repressor activity (8D'Autreaux B. Touati D. Bersch B. Latour J.M. Michaud-Soret I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16619-16624Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and thus resulting in a general derepression of the Furregulated genes. In a very similar way, nitrosylation of the [4Fe-4S]2+ center of the general oxygen regulator FNR of E. coli led to an inactivated form of FNR, which is expected to affect all FNR-regulated genes. To date, inactivation of FNR by NO has only been shown to control E. coli hmpA regulation (9Cruz-Ramos H. Crack J. Wu G. Hughes M.N. Scott C. Thomson A.J. Green J. Poole R.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).We have first analyzed the variations that occurred in the global gene expression profile of E. coli K-12 cells submitted to the deleterious effect of NO under anaerobic conditions, i.e. without the interference of the multiple species resultant from the reaction between oxygen species and NO. NO was found to alter a variety of pathways that altogether result in a change of ∼4% of the total transcriptome. Based on these results, a phenotypic analysis of various E. coli mutant strains was performed that revealed the existence of new genes involved in NO protection and demonstrated the relevant role of flavohemoglobin for the NO protection of E. coli cells grown under anaerobic conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Cell Culture, and Treatment—E. coli K-12 (American Type Culture Collection 23716) was used as the wild type strain. Strains LMS2709 (E. coli K-12 ΔnorR) and LMS2710 (E. coli K-12 ΔnorV) were constructed in collaboration with the group of Prof. J. A. Cole. In these strains, a chloramphenicol resistance cassette replaced a 1.1-kb fragment of norV (from 58 bp after the starting codon to 211 bp before the end of the gene) and a 1.4-kb fragment of the norR gene (79 bp after the starting codon and 3 bp after the end of the gene). Strain LMS2552 (E. coli K-12 ΔhmpA) was produced by replacing a 1.1-kb fragment of the gene (from 44 bp after the starting codon to 14 bp before the end of the gene) with a kanamycin resistance cassette, and strain LMS5262, a double hmpA/norV mutant of the E. coli K-12 strain, was obtained by P1 transduction of strain LMS2552 into strain LMS2710. The strain LMS3711 (E. coli K-12 ΔydiZ) gene was constructed by substituting a 764-bp fragment of the gene (from 99 bp after the starting codon to 220 bp before the end of the gene) with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette. The LMS4209 strain lacks a 550-bp fragment of the ytfE gene (between 66 bp after the start codon and 150 bp before the stop codon), which was replaced by a chloramphenicol cassette. All of the above-mentioned strains were constructed according to the Wanner and Datsenko method (10Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10979) Google Scholar). E. coli strains containing single Tn5 insertions in the open reading frames ylbE, ydfU, ydjO, nrdE, ydbD, and yfjZ were acquired from the University of Wisconsin Genome project (www.genome.wisc.edu/functional/tnmutagenesis.htm).All cells were grown anaerobically in minimal salts medium, pH 7 (11da Costa P.N. Teixeira M. Saraiva L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 218: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), at 37 °C and 150 rpm from a 2% inoculum of an overnight aerobic culture in Luria-Bertani medium. Anaerobic conditions were obtained by growing the cultures in rubber seal-capped flasks that, once filled with media and closed, were extensively bubbled with argon. Cultures were grown until reaching an A600 of 0.3, and at this point they were left untreated or exposed to NO by means of the injection of an appropriate volume of a 2 mm NO-saturated water solution in order to reach the desired concentration. Preparation of pure NO-saturated stock solutions was performed according to Ref. 12Beckman J.S. Wink D.A. Crow J.P. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1996: 61-70Google Scholar. Prior to saturation with nitric oxide, the solutions (in rubber seal-capped flasks) were depleted from residual oxygen by thorough bubbling with oxygen-free argon, which is preferred to other inert gases because it is heavier than air and will thus delay the diffusion of oxygen into anaerobic vessels. NO was then depleted from contaminants by bubbling through a gas-scrubbing bottle containing 5 m NaOH; a second scrubbing bottle containing water was used to avoid aerosol contamination. The solutions were saturated with nitric oxide and used immediately.For the DNA microarray analysis, cells were exposed to 50 μm NO and collected 15 min after the addition of NO. NO concentration was determined by using an NO amperometer with a chemically calibrated electrode. For the immunoblotting analysis, cells were exposed to 50 μm NO and collected at 5, 15, 30, 45, or 60 min post NO addition without an extra addition of NO. For the cell growth studies, E. coli wild-type and mutant strains cells were grown until reaching an A600 of 0.3 and submitted to NO exposure. Because it was observed that ∼60 min after the bolus of NO the strains were able to resume normal growth and no effects could be observed, an almost continuous nitrosative stress was achieved by repeating the NO addition five times in periods of 45 min each. The NO concentrations were chosen to cause a visible effect on the growth curve evolution of E. coli K-12 but not enough to resume growth. Furthermore, and despite the fact that physiological NO concentrations remain to be firmly established, the concentrations used are within the range reported by some authors for the in vivo NO concentrations released by macrophages (13Huffman L.J.

Total RNA was then extracted from the pellets using the hot acid phenol/chloroform method and treated with DNase I essentially as described at www.microarrays.org. Isolated RNA was quantitated on the basis of its absorption at 260 nm, visualized on an agarose gel to check quality, and stored at –20 °C until further use.Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis and Immunoblotting Analysis— The Qiagen® One-Step reverse transcriptase PCR kit was used for the analysis of the selected genes, and the reactions were performed in triplicate using the same RNA samples utilized for the DNA microarray assays. Based on the E. coli K-12 genome sequence, forward and reverse primers were designed for PCR amplification of the following DNA fragments: 110 bp for the gapA gene; 193 bp for the yfjZ gene; 362 bp for the narG gene; 497 bp for the hmpA gene; 491 bp for the norW gene; 504 bp for the norV gene; 769 bp for the ytfE gene; and 1082-bp for the yidZ gene. Prior to the reverse transcription PCR experiments, for each pair of primers the optimization of the PCR amplification conditions was done using E. coli K-12 genomic DNA as the template. For each RNA sample, control experiments in which the reverse transcriptase step was omitted were done to confirm the absence of any residual DNA. The reverse transcription PCR reactions were performed using amounts of total RNA that varied between 70 and 210 ng. To ensure that equal amounts of total RNA were loaded in the control and the test reaction, an internal standard was used. Thus, in all reactions the primers that allowed the simultaneous amplification of the E. coli gapA, a gene whose transcription level does not change under the tested conditions, were added. The results were analyzed by the Kodak Digital Science electrophoresis documentation and analysis system 120.For the immunoblotting experiments, cultures were grown under the same conditions used for the RNA assays; cells were harvested, disrupted in a French pressure cell (SLM/Aminco), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The crude extract was ultracentrifuged at 160000 × g, for 1 h, and the supernatant (soluble extract) was decanted. Total soluble protein was determined according to the method of Bradford using a standard protein mix from Sigma for standardization. Each protein sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry Millipore transfer system (Bio-Rad), according to the supplier's instructions. The membrane was incubated with rat polyclonal antiserums against E. coli flavorubredoxin (11da Costa P.N. Teixeira M. Saraiva L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 218: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or E. coli HmpA (kindly provided by Prof. R. K. Poole). After incubation with the anti-rat IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma), detection was done using 4-nitroblue-tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Roche Applied Science).Microarray Procedures and Data Analysis—For microarray analysis, the MWG E. coli K-12 array was used and the manufacturer's instructions were followed (ecom2.mwgdna.com/download/arrays/manuals/manual_bacteria.pdf). Microarray analyses were performed in triplicate, using RNA extracted from three pairs of E. coli K-12 cultures (control and NO treated). RNAs from control cells and NO-treated cells were used to prepare cDNAs labeled with Cy3/Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) and random primers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 2 h of incubation at 42 °C, the RNA was degraded by adding 1 m NaOH and further incubation at 65 °C. After neutralization with 1 m HCl, removal of unincorporated dNTPs, fluorescent dyes, and random hexamers was achieved using the PCR purification kit from Qiagen. Differentially labeled cDNA from E. coli cells not exposed and exposed to 50 μm NO was pooled and hybridized to the microarray. Hybridization, scanning, and detection procedures were done at the Euromics unit of STAB Vida Ltd. according to the MWG manual. Normalization of the data resulting from each array was performed using TIGR MI-DAS microarray data analysis system software (17Saeed A.I. Sharov V. White J. Li J. Liang W. Bhagabati N. Braisted J. Klapa M. Currier T. Thiagarajan M. Sturn A. Snuffin M. Rezantsev A. Popov D. Ryltsov A. Kostukovich E. Borisovsky I. Liu Z. Vinsavich A. Trush V. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 2003; 34: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (3967) Google Scholar). The Imagene files resulting from the array scanning for each channel were converted to TIGR Array Viewer files using TIGR Express Converter software. The intensities were normalized using the LOWESS algorithm for withintip-group normalization (18Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (2826) Google Scholar, 19Yang Y.H. Speed T. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), with the Cy3 channel as the reference and a smooth parameter of 33%. The statistically significant variation of expression in response to the nitrosative stress was obtained by filtering out those genes that had a log2(expression ratio) higher or lower than two standard deviations of the average. The microarray data analysis procedures used were fully MIAME compliant.Sequence Analysis—Searches for similar protein sequences in databases were performed using the BLAST algorithm at NCBI-BLAST and TIGR CMR-BLAST. Sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX (20Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35214) Google Scholar), version 1.8. Secondary and tertiary structure predictions were done using the PSIPRED (21McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2665) Google Scholar) and SWISSMODEL (22Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4425) Google Scholar) servers, respectively.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONGeneral Transcription Alterations—RNA extracted from cells of E. coli exposed to NO under anaerobic conditions, a favorable condition for pathogen colonization (23Kaper J.B. Nataro J.P. Mobley H.L.T. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 24Badger J.L. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5692-5697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used in DNA microarrays to analyze the global gene expression profile alteration caused by nitric oxide. Exponentially and anaerobically grown cells of wild-type E. coli K-12 were left untreated (control) or exposed to 50 μm NO. After 15 min the cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and total RNA was isolated. The amount of NO used was chosen to be sufficient for the induction of genes involved in nitric oxide detoxification without generating growth arrest (see below). Furthermore, working under anaerobic conditions allowed us to obtain a data set free of the effects caused by the complex combined chemistry of NO and oxygen.The results obtained from triplicate DNA microarray analyses were normalized and filtered for those genes with statistically significant variations of the transcription levels between control and NO exposed (i.e. log2(expression ratio) higher or lower than two standard deviations of the mean value). Of the 4288 genes analyzed, 173 (4% of the genome) passed the filter and were further analyzed. These genes were divided into two groups, those that were induced and those that were repressed (90 and 83, respectively; see supplemental tables 1 and 2, available in the on-line version of this article), and divided into functional categories based on TIGR and ECOCYC gene annotations and database searches for identified homologues (Fig. 1). For a subset of genes, reverse transcription-PCR experiments were performed and confirmed the acquired microarray data (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of yfjZ, ytfE, ylbE, yidZ, norV, norW, hmpA, nrfA, and narG expression upon NO exposure. RNAs were isolated from E. coli K-12 strains grown anaerobically in minimal salts medium to an A600 of 0.3 and then treated with 50 μm NO for 15 min (+) or collected before treatment with NO (–). The bottom band present in all reactions shows the amplification product of the internal standard gene, gapA, (see “Experimental Procedures”).

The general metabolism was clearly affected; energy metabolism was the functional category with the highest number of genes showing significant transcriptional alteration (15%), and genes involved in other metabolisms, such as central intermediary metabolism or cellular processes, had percentages of 9 and 7%, respectively. Another clear effect observed was alteration of the expression of genes involved in transport and binding (13%), which include metal ion transporters and several multidrug or other resistance transporters. A considerable number of genes involved in regulation (7%) were affected, and the same was observed for biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups, and carriers (6%), in particular those related to iron-sulfur cluster repair machinery and molybdopterin biosynthesis. The largest group of altered genes was, nevertheless, the category of the hypothetical proteins (17%), and from this category were excluded those proteins for which, despite being annotated as hypothetical in the E. coli genome data bank, the BLAST analysis revealed similarity with known proteins; therefore, they were binned in the corresponding category.Several biosynthetic pathways were affected in response to nitrosative stress exerted onto anaerobically grown E. coli. In particular, NO was found to interfere with the metabolism of pyrimidines, as shown by the decrease in the transcription level of pyrD, pyrI, and pyrB genes that encode enzymes involved in the first steps of the pyrimidine pathway. Also, the nrdHIEF operon involved in de novo biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides was induced by NO. Genes related to the maintenance of the cell structure were affected by NO, namely those encoding for the fimbria-like proteins ycbQ, ydeR, fimG, and ybgQ, which were induced, and flgB, belonging to the flg operon involved in flagellar biosynthesis, which was repressed.Genes related to the formation of iron-sulfur clusters were induced by NO; these included three genes of the suf operon, namely hscB, encoding the co-chaperone involved in the maturation of iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins, and iscA and iscR. At the genetic level, the suf and isc operons exhibit important differences, i.e. the suf operon is under the control of both the iron-dependent Fur repressor and the oxidative stress-dependent OxyR activator, whereas the isc operon is auto-regulated (25Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). NO is a damaging agent of iron-sulfur clusters, and apart from the wide variety of iron-sulfur-containing proteins involved in relevant pathways, the formation of these clusters is essential at least for the transcriptionally active form of regulators such as FNR, IscR, and SoxR (26Kiley P.J. Beinert H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Because damage of iron-sulfur centers is a major consequence of nitrosative stress, the induction of isc and suf operons may satisfy the cellular need for iron-sulfur cluster formation.NO caused inhibition of era transcription, which encodes for the widely conserved GTPase ERA, a multifunctional protein that is involved in cell cycle regulation (by triggering cell division) and protein synthesis (27Meier T.I. Peery R.B. McAllister K.A. Zhao G. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). NO also induced the transcription of the quorum-sensing regulator sdiA (suppressor of division inhibition), which controls the expression of virulence factors with a major role in colonization of the enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 (28Kanamaru K. Tatsuno I. Tobe T. Sasakawa C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Nitrosative stress caused repression of the fis gene, which encodes for the nucleoid-associated protein Fis, a pleiotropic regulator that is also proposed to regulate virulence genes in bacterial pathogens (29Falconi M. Prosseda G. Giangrossi M. Beghetto E. Colonna B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 30Wilson R.L. Libby S.J. Freet A.M. Boddicker J.D. Fahlen T.F. Jones B.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Goldberg M.D. Johnson M. Hinton J.C. Williams P.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Resulting from nitrosative stress on the bacterial cells, the SOS response genes (32Khil P.P. Camerini-Otero R.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) such as umuC, cho, and molR-3 were induced, whereas rmuC was repressed. Despite the strong transcription increase of soxS caused by NO, no changes occurred in any of the SoxRS regulon genes, as was also observed for E. coli treated with NO donors under aerobic conditions (33Mukhopadhyay P. Zheng M. Bedzyk L.A. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The existence of inhibitor mechanisms of SoxS by NO cannot be excluded, although it cannot be understood on the basis of the SoxS primary sequence. On the contrary, all of the known Fur-repressed genes were induced, and genes known to be Fur-induced showed a diminished expression. These results are in accordance with the proposed inactivation of the DNA binding capacity of Fur caused by NO (8D'Autreaux B. Touati D. Bersch B. Latour J.M. Michaud-Soret I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16619-16624Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the concomitant abolishment of Fur-dependent regulation. Consistent with the inactivation of FNR by NO (34Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), it was generally observed that FNR-repressed genes (ndh, hmpA, gpmA, and lpdA) were induced, whereas FNR-activated genes were repressed (narG, pyrD, yjiH, aroP, and rmuC). However, because of overlapping transcriptional regulation some genes failed this trend, as was observed for the FNR-repressed nuo operon whose transcription was diminished by NO. Hence, and contrary to SoxRS, Fur and FNR seem to be NO-sensitive regulators resulting in a finely tuned control of their regulons, i.e. they act as multi-responsive regulators.Although it has been considered that NO needs to be oxidized to react with DNA (35Spek E.J. Wright T.L. Stitt M.S. Taghizadeh N.R. Tannenbaum S.R. Marinus M.G. Engelward B.P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we observed that upon exposure to NO under anaerobic conditions E. coli activated the regeneration systems, namely by changing the level of DNA repair enzymes. The nrdEF operon codes for the class Ib ribonucleotide reductase, and its expression is tightly co-regulated with genes encoding the accessory proteins NrdH and NrdI (36Monje-Casas F. Jurado J. Prieto-Alamo M.J. Holmgren A. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18031-18037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Under anaerobic growth conditions, the addition of NO induced transcription of the entire gene cluster nrdHIEF, whereas it was reported that S-nitrosylated glutathione (GSNO) under aerobic conditions only increased the nrdHI gene expression (33Mukhopadhyay P. Zheng M. Bedzyk L.A. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, and in contrast to the other ribonucleotide reductases present in E. coli, the one encoded by nrdHIEF does not respond to inhibitors of DNA replication or DNA-damaging agents that induce the SOS response. To date, it is only known that its expression is triggered by oxidative stress in an OxyR-, SoxRS-, Fis-, RpoS-, cAMP-, or RecA-independent way (36Monje-Casas F. Jurado J. Prieto-Alamo M.J. Holmgren A. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18031-18037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). NO also caused the increase of the transcription of various genes encoding proteins related to multiple resistances, namely ydhK, which encodes a hypothetical protein that contains a fusaric acid resistance conserved region, yajR, fsr, and ydh, which encode putative bacterial drug-export proteins that mediate resistance to antibiotics, and the operon tehAB, which encodes tellurite resistance proteins (37Walter E.G. Taylor D.E. Plasmid. 1992; 27: 52-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (67)"
https://openalex.org/W2136719235,"Bass hepcidin was purified from the gill of hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops × Morone saxatilis) based on antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. This 21-amino acid peptide has 8 cysteines engaged in 4 disulfide bonds and is very similar to human hepcidin, an antimicrobial peptide with iron regulatory properties. To gain insight into potential role(s) of bass hepcidin in innate immunity in fish, we synthesized the peptide, characterized its antimicrobial activities in vitro, determined its solution structure by NMR, and quantified hepatic gene expression in vivo following infection of bass with the fish pathogens, Streptococcus iniae or Aeromonas salmonicida. Its structure is very similar to that of human hepcidin, including the presence of an antiparallel β-sheet, a conserved disulfide-bonding pattern, and a rare vicinal disulfide bond. Synthetic bass hepcidin was active in vitro against Gram-negative pathogens and fungi but showed no activity against key Gram-positive pathogens and a single yeast strain tested. Hepcidin was non-hemolytic at microbicidal concentrations and had lower specific activity than moronecidin, a broad spectrum, amphipathic, α-helical, antimicrobial peptide constitutively expressed in bass gill tissue. Good synergism between the bacterial killing activities of hepcidin and moronecidin was observed in vitro. Hepcidin gene expression in bass liver increased significantly within hours of infection with Gram-positive (S. iniae) or Gram-negative (A. salmonicida) pathogens and was 4–5 orders of magnitude above base-line 24–48 h post-infection. Our results suggest that hepcidin plays a key role in the antimicrobial defenses of bass and that its functions are potentially conserved between fish and human."

Heat shock proteins (Hsps) exported to the plasma membrane or released from dying cells are believed to be a source of “danger” signals, informing the innate and adaptive immune systems of tissue damage induced by various insults including infection, injury, toxins, heat, and/or cellular stress (13Johnson G.B.

Owen N. Coates A. Henderson B. Steptoe A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have emerged as central players in inflammation and innate immunity and are triggered by a variety of pathogen- and host-derived factors, thereby detecting both infection and tissue damage. Host Hsp60, Hsp70, and Gp96 have been reported to be agonists for TLR2 and TLR4 (14Flohe S.B. Bruggemann J. Lendemans S. Nikulina M. Meierhoff G. Flohe S. Kolb H. J.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and these receptors are also triggered by lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), respectively. How cell surface or serum Hsp60 might interact with TLR4 signaling remains unclear. Hsps have been localized to the multicomponent TLR4 receptor complex and may influence signal transduction (20Triantafilou M. Triantafilou K. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 301-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Hsp60 may interact with other components of the multifaceted mammalian LPS recognition system leading to modulation of LPS-mediated signaling (7Barazi H.O. Zhou L. Templeton N.S. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1541-1548PubMed Google Scholar, 21Triantafilou M. Triantafilou K. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2004; 2004: 1-18Google Scholar). Recent evidence has, however, cast doubt on the ability of Hsp60 and Hsp70 to induce pro-inflammatory responses by themselves, since Hsp preparations substantially free of LPS and lipoprotein contaminations failed to stimulate macrophages (22Gao B. Tsan M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 1149-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Tsan M.F. Gao B. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C739-C744Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, anti-Hsp60 antibodies can inhibit Hsp60-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages (24Bulut Y. Faure E. Thomas L. Karahashi H. Michelsen K.S. Equils O. Morrison S.G. Morrison R.P. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 25Retzlaff C. Yamamoto Y. Hoffman P.S. Friedman H. Klein T.W. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5689-5693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps suggesting that Hsp60 may potentiate TLR4 signaling by low levels of LPS rather than being responsible for TLR-mediated cellular activation in isolation (13Johnson G.B. Brunn G.J. Platt J.L. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 23: 15-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).TLR engagement primarily results in activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (16Beg A.A. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 509-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), although a series of other pathways are also triggered, including interferon regulatory factor 3, p38 mitogen-activated kinase, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal related kinase pathways (14Flohe S.B.

Immunity. 2002; 17: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The patterns of gene expression induced by ligation of the different TLRs are distinct but often overlap. For instance a large proportion of the genes up-regulated by double-stranded RNA via TLR3 ligation are also up-regulated by LPS via TLR4 ligation (26Doyle S. Vaidya S. O'Connell R. Dadgostar H. Dempsey P. Wu T. Rao G. Sun R. Haberland M. Modlin R. Cheng G. Immunity. 2002; 17: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). TLRs are expressed on cells of the monocyte lineage including macrophages and dendritic cells, and their ligation usually leads to secretion of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines; for instance LPS binding to macrophage TLR4 results in TNF-α, IL-6, and RANTES secretion (14Flohe S.B.

Excessive inflammation or uncurtailed immune responses can be detrimental to the host; hence, a number of negative feedback systems have evolved to dampen secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators (28Fukao T. Koyasu S. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 358-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 29Lee T.S. Chau L.Y. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). These include IL-10, an important immunoregulatory cytokine that is involved in limitation of inflammatory responses and induction of immune tolerance (29Lee T.S. Chau L.Y. Nat.

We demonstrate here that recombinant Hsp10 substantially free of endotoxin inhibited LPS-induced activation of NF-κB, reduced LPS-induced TNF-α, RANTES, and IL-6 secretion, and enhanced IL-10 production. Anti-Hsp60 antibodies prevented and mimicked Hsp10 inhibitory activity, suggesting that Hsp10 may inhibit pro-inflammatory responses by interacting with extracellular Hsp60. We were unable to confirm earlier reports that Hsp10 has tumor growth factor properties (37Morton H. Cavanagh A.C. Athanasas-Platsis S. Quinn K.A. Rolfe B.E. Reprod. Fertil.

Inflamm. 1995; 45: 126-135PubMed Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Prof. D. Hume, University of Queensland) were cultured (43Mateo L. La Linn M. McColl S.R. Cross S. Gardner J. Suhrbier A. Intervirology. 2000; 43: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in the presence of G418 (200 μg/ml) for 1 week after recovery from liquid nitrogen and grown as suspension cultures in 25-cm3 flasks (Greiner Labortechnik, Frickenhausen, Germany). RAW264-HIV-LTR-LUC cells were disaggregated by repeated pipetting and plated at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and incubated overnight (37 °C and 5% CO2). LPS from Escherichia coli (Sigma L-6529; strain 055:B5, Sigma) was dissolved in sterile distilled water and stored at 4 °C at 1 mg/ml in glass vials. Immediately before use the solution was vigorously vortexed before aliquots were taken. The cells were incubated with LPS, Hsp10, or control buffers for 2 h followed by the addition of stimulating LPS at the indicated concentrations. After a further 2-h incubation the adherent cells were processed for the luciferase assay (Luciferase Assay System, Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was read for 15 s on a Turner Designs Luminometer TD 20/20.Production and Purification of Hsp10—Recombinant human Hsp10 (GenBank™ accession number X75821) was produced in E. coli essentially as described by Ryan et al. (44Ryan M.T. Naylor D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Hoj P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22037-22043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, the material that did not bind Macro-Prep High Q (Bio-Rad) was further purified by S-Sepharose and then gel filtration (Superdex 200, Amersham Biosciences). Purified Hsp10 in a 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 150 mm NaCl buffer was filtered through an Acrodisc filter system with a 0.2-mm Mustang E membrane according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI; catalog number MSTG5E3) to remove residual endotoxins and was stored at –70 °C. The purity of Hsp10 was determined to be >97% by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots were thawed once before use. All batches of Hsp10 showed the same molar activity as GroES in GroEL-mediated rhodanese refolding assays (45Brinker A. Pfeifer G. Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Cell. 2001; 107: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) (data not shown). LPS contamination of Hsp10 was determined by the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) to be <1 endotoxin units/mg purified Hsp10 protein.Trypsin Treatment of Hsp10—2.5% trypsin (Gibco) was filtered through an Acrodisc filter as above twice and added at 40 μg/ml to Hsp10 (at 2–3 mg/ml). After incubation at 37 °C overnight the trypsin/Hsp10 solution was heated to 90 °C for 15 min to destroy trypsin activity and cooled before addition to the bioassays. After trypsin treatment no Hsp10 could be detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and the material was inactive in the rhodanese refolding assay (data not shown).Tumor Cell Lines—K562 (human erythroleukemia), Mono Mac 6 (human monocytic line), U937 (human histiocytic lymphoma), P815 (mouse mastocytoma), EL4 (mouse T cell lymphoma), Jurkat (human T cell leukemia), RAW 264.7 (ATCC TIB 71, mouse macrophage), L929 (mouse fibrosarcoma), B16 (mouse melanoma), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), and MCA-2 (mouse fibrosarcoma) cell lines were shown to be mycoplasma negative (46Linn M.L. Bellett A.J. Parsons P.G. Suhrbier A. J. Virol. Methods. 1995; 52: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in medium including RPMI 1640 (or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for MCA-2 cells) (Gibco), 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 2 mm glutamine (Sigma), 10 mm HEPES (Sigma), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin (CSL Ltd, Melbourne, Australia).In Vitro Growth Assay—Cells were seeded into 96-well flat bottom plates at 4 × 103 cells/well at the indicated concentration of Hsp10. After 2–4 days in culture and before cells reached confluence, adherent cells were fixed in 100% methanol, and protein was determined using the sulforhodamine B assay (47Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8731) Google Scholar). Non-adherent cells were counted under microscope hemocytometer in the presence of trypan blue to indicate non-viable cells. Anti-Hsp10 antibody was raised in rabbits by immunizing four times with Hsp10 (100 μg) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. IgG was purified from serum using protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) followed by affinity column chromatography using Hsp10 coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Purified anti-Hsp10 IgG at 2.74 mg/ml had an end point titer of 1 in 2 million by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IgG purified from naive rabbit serum was used as a control and had no detectable reactivity to Hsp10 by ELISA.In Vivo Tumor Growth—B16 cells, Lewis lung, or MCA-2 tumors were inoculated subcutaneously (105 cells per site, 2 sites per mouse, 5 mice per group) into the shaved backs of C57BL/6 or CBA mice (for MCA-2). Doses of 10 or 100 μg/mouse of Hsp10 were given subcutaneously daily for 10 days beginning on the day of tumor inoculation. Control groups received the same volume of 50 mm Tris/saline buffer. Tumor growth was monitored as described previously (48Anraku I. Harvey T.J. Linedale R. Gardner J. Harrich D. Suhrbier A. Khromykh A.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3791-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mice bearing tumors greater than 100 mm2 were euthanized.RAW264.7 IL-6 and RANTES Assays—RAW264.7 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and cultured overnight (37 °C and 5% CO2). Hsp10 or buffer was added to cells in triplicate for 2 h followed by the addition of LPS (1 ng/ml). After 6 h, supernatants were collected and analyzed for RANTES and IL-6 using specific ELISA-paired antibody kits (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). ELISA standards and samples were run in duplicate, and the sensitivity of the assays was 31 and 15.6 pg/ml for RANTES and IL-6, respectively. The optical density (450 nm) of each sample was determined using a microplate reader (Tecan Sunrise, Austria, with Magellan V3.11 software).Cytokine Production from Splenocytes and Macrophages Derived from Hsp10-treated Animals—C57BL/6 (H-2b, Ly-5.2+) mice were purchased from the Australian Research Centre (Perth, Western Australia, Australia) and C57BL/6 IL-10–/– mice (H-2b, Ly-5.2+) were supplied by the Australian National University (Canberra, Australia). The culture medium used throughout was 10% fetal bovine serum/Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acid, 0.02 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm HEPES, and cells were cultured at pH 7.75, 37 °C, and 5% CO2. C57BL/6 mice (n = 3 per group) were treated with subcutaneous injections of Hsp10 (100 μg) or diluent buffer daily for 5 days, and peritoneal macrophages were harvested on the sixth day by peritoneal lavage and pooled from individual animals within the treatment group. Cells were plated in triplicate at 2 × 105/well in the presence of LPS (1 μg/ml). Culture supernatants were collected at 5 h, and levels of TNF-α were assessed by ELISA. Results were normalized to production per 105 macrophages based on CD11b staining by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of input cells.For IL-10 determination, splenocytes were harvested from the same animals and pooled as above and cultured in triplicate at 5 × 105 cells/well in the absence (not shown) or presence of LPS (10 μg/ml). Culture supernatants were collected at 48 h, and levels of IL-10 were determined by ELISA.For T cell-derived cytokine production, spleen-derived nylon wool-purified T cells (49MacDonald K.P. Rowe V. Filippich C. Thomas R. Clouston A.D. Welply J.K. Hart D.N. Ferrara J.L. Hill G.R. Blood. 2003; 101: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (2 × 106 CD3-positive cells/24 well) from Hsp10-treated or control-treated C57BL/6 mice were stimulated in vitro with irradiated (2000 rads) allogeneic B6D2F1 splenocytes (3 × 106/24 wells). After 7 days cells were collected and plated in triplicate (5 × 105 CD3-positive cells/96-well) and re-stimulated with plate-bound antibodies to CD3 and CD28 (from hybridomas 2C11 and N37.51), which were prepared by incubating the antibodies (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C in 96-well flat bottom plates followed by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline (49MacDonald K.P. Rowe V. Filippich C. Thomas R. Clouston A.D. Welply J.K. Hart D.N. Ferrara J.L. Hill G.R. Blood. 2003; 101: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants were harvested at 24 h, and concentrations of cytokines were determined by ELISA.The monoclonal antibody pairs used in the TNF-α, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL-10, and IL-4 ELISA assays were used at concentrations recommended by the supplier (Pharmingen). Supernatants were diluted in culture medium 1:1 for IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-α and 1:50 for IFN-γ. Cytokines were captured by the capture antibody and detected by the direct biotin-labeled detection antibody. Streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard and Perry laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and substrate (Sigmafast OPD, Sigma) was then used to measure immobilized biotin. Plates were read at 492 nm using the Spectraflour Plus microplate reader (Tecan). Recombinant cytokines (Pharmingen) were used as standards for ELISA assays. Standards were run in duplicate, and the sensitivity of the assays was 0.063 units/ml for IFN-γ and 15 pg/ml for IL-10, IL-4, and TNF-α.Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) TNF-α and IL-6 Assays—Human PBMC were isolated from heparinized blood of healthy volunteers by buoyant density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences). PBMC were dispensed at 106 viable cells/ml in 200 μl in 96-well tissue culture plates (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmuenster, Austria). Hsp10 was then added, and plates were incubated for 1 h followed by LPS addition and a further 20-h incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, after which supernatants were collected, and duplicate samples were analyzed for TNF-α and IL-6 levels (Duoset ELISA kits, R & D Systems). The sensitivity of these assays was 31 pg/ml TNF-α and 9 pg/ml IL-6.Mouse Serum TNF-α, RANTES, and IL-10 Assays after LPS Injection—Female BALB/c mice aged 6–8 weeks were given 100 μg of Hsp10/mouse with or without LPS at 10 μg/mouse. Hsp10 was administered intravenously ∼30 min before the intravenous injection of LPS diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (the final volume was 100 μl; see above for preparation and storage of LPS stock solution). The mice were sacrificed, and blood was collected via cardiac puncture 1.5 h after LPS challenge. Blood was collected into 0.8-ml clotting accelerator tubes (MiniCollect, Interpath) and serum-stored at 4 °C for analysis of TNF-α, RANTES, and IL-10 using commercially available ELISA kits (R & D Systems, BD Biosciences Pharmingen).Bone Marrow Transplantation and Graft Verses Host Disease—Female 8–14-week-old C57BL/6 (B6, H-2b, Ly-5.2+), B6 Ptprca Ly-5a (H-2b, Ly-5.1+), and B6D2F1 (H-2b/d, Ly-5.2+) (50Morse H.C. II I Shen F.W. Hammerling U. Immunogenetics. 1987; 25: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) mice were purchased from the Australian Research Centre (Perth, Western Australia). Hsp10 (100 μg per animal) or control diluent buffer was injected subcutaneously daily for 5 days into donor and recipient animals before transplant. Mice were housed in sterilized microisolator cages and received acidified autoclaved water (pH 2.5) and normal food for the first 2 weeks post-transplantation. Mice were transplanted according to a standard protocol described previously (51Hill G.R. Crawford J.M. Cooke K.R. Brinson Y.S. Pan L. Ferrara J.L.

Briefly, on day 1 B6D2F1 mice received 1300 centigray total body irradiation (137Cs source at 108 centigray/min) split into two doses separated by 3 h to minimize gastrointestinal toxicity. Donor bone marrow (5 × 106) and donor nylon wool purified splenic T cells (2 × 106) were resuspended in 0.25 ml of Leibovitz's L-15 media (Invitrogen) and were injected intravenously into each recipient. Survival was monitored daily, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) clinical scores were measured weekly. The degree of systemic GVHD was assessed by a scoring system, which sums changes in five clinical parameters, which are weight loss, posture (hunching), activity, fur texture, and skin integrity (maximum index = 10) (51Hill G.R.

Animals with severe clinical GVHD (scores >6) were sacrificed according to ethical guidelines, and the day of death was deemed to be the following day.Inhibition of Hsp10 Activity with Anti-Hsp60 Serum—RAW264-HIV-LTR-LUC cells were plated and incubated overnight as above. The medium was replaced, and goat polyclonal anti-Hsp60 serum (1/1000 dilution) (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) or the same dilution of normal goat serum was added for 1 h."

Binding studies by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and peptide mapping combined with comparative modeling utilizing crystal structures led for the first time to a molecular model revealing the binding of both occludin and α-catenin to the same binding site in ZO-1. Our data support a concept that ZO-1 successively associates with α-catenin at the adherens junction and occludin at the tight junction. Strong spatial evidence indicates that the occludin C-terminal coiled-coil domain dimerizes and interacts finally as a four-helix bundle with the identified structural motifs in ZO-1. The helix bundle of occludin406–521 and α-catenin509–906 interacts with the hinge region (ZO-1591–632 and ZO-1591–622, respectively) and with (ZO-1726–754 and ZO-1756–781) in the GuK domain of ZO-1 containing coiled-coil and α-helical structures, respectively. The selectivity of both protein-protein interactions is defined by complementary shapes and charges between the participating epitopes. In conclusion, a common molecular mechanism of forming an intermolecular helical bundle between the hinge region/GuK domain of ZO-1 and α-catenin and occludin is identified as a general molecular principle organizing the association of ZO-1 at adherens and tight junctions.

News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast, AJ play important roles in cell adhesion, migration, morphogenesis, and proliferation. AJ represent Ca2+-dependent cell-cell contacts localized basolateral of TJ, where transmembrane proteins of the cadherin family mediate adhesion. Assembly of AJ is a prerequisite for the formation of TJ and desmosomes (2Gumbiner B. Stevenson B. Grimaldi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). β- and α-catenin bind to the cadherin cytoplasmic domain and link the cadherin-catenin complex to the F-actin cytoskeleton. An important scaffolding protein in cell-cell contacts is the zona occludens protein 1. ZO-1 is a membrane associated guanylate kinase homologue protein composed of the following domains: three PDZ (PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1), a SH3, a GuK (3González-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), an actin binding region (4Fanning A.S. Ma T.Y. Anderson J.M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1835-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and a ZU5 (ZO-1 and Unc5-like netrin receptor domain) according SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (smart.embl-heidelberg.de) data base (5Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar)). In non-epithelial cells ZO-1 is a major component of AJ, whereas in epithelial cells it is localized at TJ by directly binding to claudins (6Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Occludin, one of the transmembrane proteins of TJ, is a multiphosphoprotein involved in regulation of TJ (7Andreeva A.Y.

It has four transmembrane domains with two extracellular loops and a cytosolic N and C terminus. A sequence of 244 amino acids in human ZO-1633–876 containing the GuK domain and an acidic region C terminus to GuK binds to the complete intracellular C-terminal tail of chicken occludin (8Fanning A.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar).ZO-1 also binds to the AJ protein α-catenin (9Imamura Y. Itoh M. Maeno Y. Tsukita S. Nagafuchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and to connexins in gap junctions (10Kausalya P.J. Reichert M. Hunziker W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), indicating a general scaffolding function of ZO-1 in junctional complexes. α-Catenin consists of several four-helix-bundle domains (vinculin homology domains, VH1–3) and binds β-catenin via an intermolecular helix bundle mechanisms within the E-cadherin-catenin complex at the intracellular side of AJ, where one helix of β-catenin interacts with one helix bundle (VH1) of α-catenin (11Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Vasioukhin V. Fuchs E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). It was shown that the complete α-catenin sequence (13Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and truncated mouse α-catenin509–906, α-catenin631–906 (9Imamura Y. Itoh M. Maeno Y. Tsukita S. Nagafuchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) constructs, bind the N-terminal half of ZO-11–862. Although several proteins are known that are involved in TJ and AJ, one reason for the poor understanding of their molecular interaction mechanism and regulation is the poor availability of structure-functional data for most of these proteins and their potential interactions. Moreover, the detailed association sites, three-dimensional structures, and molecular interaction mechanisms of the participating proteins are unknown.In this report systematic studies on structure function relationships of junctional proteins are presented to discover the protein-protein interaction principles involved in cell communication. To provide support for the molecular understanding of the intracellular recruiting mechanisms at TJ and AJ, we determine here how the TJ protein occludin and the AJ protein α-catenin interact with the junctional recruiting protein ZO-1. In detail, we wanted to identify determinants that are involved in the intermolecular interaction and to obtain indications for their spatial cooperation. Our strategy was built on our findings that due to high sequence homology, the C-terminal coiledcoil domain of occludin shares a common structure with four helical bundle fragments found in the crystal structure of α-catenin.In this study we demonstrate the localization of coiled-coil motifs and α-helical elements in the C-terminal part of occludin at the C-terminal half of α-catenin and at the SH3-hinge-GuK unit of ZO-1 as intermolecular association sites and determine their relative spatial orientation. Moreover, our data provide strong support that α-catenin and occludin both interact in a four-helix-bundle motif with the same epitopes of ZO-1, namely with coiled-coil and α-helical elements of its SH3-hinge-GuK unit.MATERIALS AND METHODSBiocomputing—The GCG program package (GCG Wisconsin package Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for sequence comparisons. If not mentioned otherwise the comparison matrix blossum62 was used to calculate the percentage of similarity. For secondary structure predictions www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/~www-jpred was used, calculating a consensus prediction of the query sequence from several secondary structure prediction programs. COILSCAN of the GCG program package COILS (www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html; based on the algorithm of Lupas (14Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar, 15Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and MATCH (cis.poly.edu/~jps) (16Fischetti V.A. Landau G.M. Schmidt J.P. Sellers P. Information Processing Letters. 1993; 45: 11-18Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were applied to identify helices with potential coiled-coil (CC) properties. COILS used MTIDK (a scoring matrix derived from myosins, tropomyosins, intermediate filaments, desmosomal proteins, and kinesins) as a training set for the CC prediction with an option to weigh the CC-heptad core position a and d 2.5 times more to exclude false positive predictions of charge-rich sequences. Except for the program MATCH, which aligns the sequence to the seven positions (a–g) of the coiled-coil heptad motif, the other two programs allow for a search of CC helices to adjust the search window to 14, 21, or 28 amino acids. If not mentioned otherwise, all sequence numbers were derived from mouse.Homology Modeling—For selection of suitable structural templates, we first searched the PDB data base (17Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26670) Google Scholar) for sequence similarity using FASTA, a program for fast alignment. The sequences of occludin (Swissprot accession number Q61146) and ZO-1 (P39447) were adopted to the corresponding templates using the biopolymer module of the program Sybyl 6.8 from Tripos Inc. Small changes in loops were done by the loop search function of Sybyl, whereas large loops were modeled by assembling overlapping structural fragments comparable with the ROSETTA algorithm (18Simons K.T. Bonneau R. Ruczinski I. Baker D. Proteins. 1999; : 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The resulting models were minimized with an AMBER 4.1 force field and simulated with a 0.5-ns molecular dynamics run. The geometric accuracy was analyzed by using the PROCHECK program (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).Overexpression and Purification of Occludin, ZO-1, and α-Catenin— Occludin constructs were produced by PCR from the complete C-terminal sequence (amino acids 264–521) as described (20Schmidt A. Utepbergenov D.I. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ZO-1 sequences containing the SH3 domain were derived from full-length cDNA of human ZO-1 (a kind gift from Alan Fanning, Chapel Hill, NC (8Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar)). GuK sequences were generated from mouse ZO-1 cDNA by PCR (20Schmidt A. Utepbergenov D.I. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fulllength mouse α-catenin cDNA was isolated from pCIneo α-catenin (21Huber O. Krohn M. Kemler R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1759-1765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs of ZO-1 and occludin were cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites (those of α-catenin between EcoRI and SalI) of pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in-frame with MBP. The plasmids were verified by sequencing. Overexpression and purification of the proteins were carried out as described (20Schmidt A. Utepbergenov D.I. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To obtain pure ccludin406–521, MBP was cut off by protease Xa (New England Biolabs; 1 μg/50–100 μg, 25 or 37 °C, 16 h). Maltose was removed by dialysis, and subsequently MBP was removed by amylose-resin columns. Occludin in the flowthrough was concentrated by centrifugation (Amicron Ultra-15, Millipore Schwalbach, Germany).Occludin406–521 and α-catenin509–906 were recloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pGEX-4T-1 vector and transformed into Escherichia coli (TOP10F′, Invitrogen). The expressed GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose affinity columns (Sigma-Aldrich), washed with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml RNase, 1 mm proteinase inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich), and eluted with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, and 2 mm glutathione. Subsequently, glutathione was removed by a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Bioscience).Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy; Protein-Protein Binding Studies—A Biacore 2000 instrument and CM5 chips (BIACORE AB, Uppsala, Sweden) were used as reported (20Schmidt A. Utepbergenov D.I. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, immobilization of MBP fusion proteins was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4. To adjust protein densities on the chip, an occludin construct containing all predicted secondary structural features (occludin406–521) was always immobilized as internal control to be compared with other fragments used for binding studies with ZO-1 constructs. The binding procedure for all experiments was 4 min of injection of sample at a flow rate of 8 μl/min using running buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm maltose).Peptide Epitope Mapping Analysis—To analyze occludin and α-catenin epitopes, peptide spots with peptides of 29 amino acids in length spanning occludin400–521 with a shift of 1 amino acid between each peptide were synthesized on Whatman 50 paper (Medstone, England) (22Kramer A. Schneider-Mergener J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 25-39PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides from ZO-1 containing the CC1 (ZO-1597–633) and H2 regions (ZO-1745–772) were synthesized with an N-terminal linker of two β-alanines and one cysteine and coupled to the red dye tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, The Netherlands). The membranes were incubated with the labeled peptides of ZO-1 and after washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the interacting peptides were directly visible (23Toepert F. Knaute T. Guffler S. Pires J.R. Matzdorf T. Oschkinat H. Schneider-Mergener J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The dye coupled to mercaptoethanol was used as a negative control.GST Fusion Protein Analysis—For ZO-1 epitopes, spot membranes with peptides of 20 amino acids in length spanning ZO-1571–645 and 726–810 were synthesized as above. After 2 h in blocking buffer (made from BB concentrate (Sigma #B6429), 5% (w/v) saccharose in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, the membranes were incubated overnight with 200 nm GST-occludin406–521 or GST-α-catenin509–906 in blocking buffer at room temperature. After 3 × 10 min washing in Tris-buffered saline the membranes were treated at room temperature for 90 min with anti-GST-horseradish peroxidase-conjugate antibody (1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline; Amersham Bioscience). Binding was quantified after 3 × 10 min of washing in Tris-buffered saline with a chemiluminescence kit (Uptima; Interchim, Montiucon Cedex, France) in a Lumi-Imager F1™ (Roche Applied Science). GST alone was used as negative control.RESULTSCoiled-coil Helical Regions, as a Structural Interaction Motif, Occur in Occludin, α-Catenin, and in ZO-1Bioinformatic studies identified coiled-coil helical patterns in occludin, α-catenin, and ZO-1. The C-terminal part of the occludin cytoplasmic tail (mouse amino acids 406–521) was predicted to consist of multiple helices termed Oc-Ha, Oc-Hb, Oc-CCa, Oc-CCb, and Oc-Hc (occludin400–414, -422–433, -438–463, -471–486, -494–514; Fig. 1A, Table I). Some helices (Oc-CCa, Oc-CCb, and partly Oc-Hb) exhibited potential coiled-coil properties with 100% probability. The classical coiled-coil (CC) pattern shows a heptad pattern of amino acid (abcdefg) with the positions a and d mostly hydrophobic and forming the core of two or more interwoven helices (24Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Comparison of the available crystal structures for α-catenin portions and the homologous domains in vinculin (PDB entries see Fig. 1B) indicates common four-helix-bundle structure motifs at VH1–3, which also contain portions of coiled-coil properties (Table I). In ZO-1, two relatively short coiled-coil helices were predicted as potential protein-protein interaction regions; that is, in the hinge region between the SH3 and GuK domains (mouse ZO-1611–624) termed ZO-1-CC1 and within the C-terminal sequence of the GuK domain (ZO-1784–798) termed ZO-1-CC2 (Fig. 1C). ZO-1-CC1 is located in the N terminus before the amino acids of the reported site to interact with occludin (8Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Coiled-coil patterns for CC1 were predicted with significant probability only if the smallest search window (size 14) of the program COILS was applied. The predicted coiled-coil probability (60%) was not affected by using the weighting function of COILS (61%) showing the influence of the hydrophobic heptad positions a and d. This confirms a significant propensity to form a short coiled-coil helix in ZO-1-CC1.Table IComparison of coiled-coil sequence regions in occludin, α-catenin, and ZO-1 from mouse predicted by different methods (MATCH, COILS, and Coilscan)Protein-substructural element (see Fig. 1)Predicted regionCC probabilityMATCHCoilscan and COILS (window size)CoilscanCOILS (MTIDK)aNo significant predictionNormalWeighted%%ZO-1-CC1607–624611–624 (w14)506061ZO-1-CC2785–797784–798 (w14)929491Oc-Hb, Oc-CCa, -Oc-CCb426–498424–488 (w28)100100100α-Catenin -VH2328–385327–351 (w21)515528bScoring matrix derived from myosins, tropomyosins, intermediate filaments, desmosomal proteins, and kinesins (14)357–385 (w28)1009997α-Catenin N terminus of VH3667–702678–707 (w28)999969α-Catenin C terminus of VH3873–889876–889 (w14)526118a No significant predictionb Scoring matrix derived from myosins, tropomyosins, intermediate filaments, desmosomal proteins, and kinesins (14Lupas A.

Surprisingly, the closest structural homology was found in a part of VH1 domain of α-catenin, revealing a four-helix-bundle (PDB code 1DOV). Occludin436–521 (containing the structural elements Oc-CCa/-b, -Hc) showed 37% sequence similarity to the α-catenin portion 1DOV172–262 (Fig. 1, A and B). In the N terminus (occludin406–435 corresponding to Oc-Ha, -Hb), the model was extended by a template from the coiled-coil from four-helix-bundle helix protein STAT-1 comprising a negatively charged helix-turn-helix region (PDB code 1BF5278–306; 55% similarity, Fig. 1A). Because the coiled-coil prediction includes Oc-CCa and nearly the complete Oc-Hb, we postulate a continuous helix in this region, and the fragments were connected accordingly. Our model clearly indicated that occludin very likely adopts a helical bundle fold similar to α-catenin (see below). However, we cannot exclude that the helix Oc-Hc with mainly basic residues could flip toward the acidic helix Oc-Ha, resulting in three helix bundles (Fig. 2C). The electrostatic potential at the surface of the occludin monomer (Fig. 2D) exhibited negative potentials at the two ends of the bundle interrupted by a positive potential caused by the bend basic α-helix Oc-Hc (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Monomeric architectural models of α-catenin, occludin C-terminal coiled-coil domain, and of SH3-hinge-GuK unit of ZO-1. Electrostatic potential at the surface of α-catenin509–630 crystal structure (from PDB code 1H6G) (A) and α-catenin685–855 (B) based on vinculin (PDB code 1RKE) show negative electrostatic patches.

The electrostatic potentials of monomeric occludin domain (D) and monomeric ZO-1-SH3-hinge-GuK unit (E) show no complementary patterns fitting to a 1:1 intermolecular interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)α-Catenin—Four structures from α-catenin are available comprising the vinculin homologous regions VH1 and VH2, each consisting of four-helix bundles partly containing coiled-coil properties. VH3 of α-catenin can be represented by vinculin structures (Fig. 1B). VH2 consists of two four-helix bundles starting at residues 377 and 509, respectively. The electrostatic potential at the molecular surface for the structure of α-catenin509–630 (1H6G) shows occludin-like monomers at both ends of the four-helix-bundle negatively charged areas (Fig. 2A). The negative electrostatic potential on the surface of α-catenin685–855 corresponding to VH3 (model based on vinculin, 1RKE) is even extended to a long continuous acidic patch on one side (Fig. 2B).ZO-1—For homology modeling of the GuK domain, guanylate kinase structures of the yeast enzyme (PDB codes 1GKY, 1EX6, 1EX7) and from the MAGUK protein human CASK (PDB code 1KGD) were available. The most impact to our structure-function considerations had structures containing the SH3 and GuK domain of another MAGUK protein, PSD-95 (PDB codes 1KJW, 1JXM, 1JXO). Therein SH3 and GuK were linked to form a common structural unit stabilized via the interaction of six β-strands (A-F). The β-strands were located inside the SH3 domain (A-D) and N-terminal (E) and C-terminal (F) to GuK (25McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C and 2D). The high sequence similarity (45%) between ZO-1518–806 and PSD-95430–724 is even more pronounced when only the SH3 (51%) or GuK (45%) domains were compared (Fig. 1C). Only the hinge region between the SH3 and GuK and the GMP binding loop within GuK of PSD-95 showed differences in length and sequence compared with ZO-1. The hinge region in ZO-1 is about 20 residues longer than in PSD-95, and additionally it contains the predicted ZO-1-CC1, whereas the GMP binding loop in ZO-1 is 30 amino acids shorter (Fig. 1C). Alignment of sequences from more than 30 MAGUK proteins (not shown) revealed that the SH3-hinge-GuK unit seems to be a common feature of this protein family. In the homology model for ZO-1 we modified the hinge region at two sites; first, by elongation of the template helix after the C terminus of the SH3 domain according α-helix predictions (with PDB code 1EPU170–181); second, because the hinge region of ZO-1 is longer than in the template used (PSD95), the predicted coiled-coil region ZO-1-CC1 (structural fragment adopted from the CC-template PDB 1A9217–45) was inserted into the ZO-1 hinge region. The resulting coiled-coil helix CC1 (red/blue) at the hinge region (red) and the α-helices H1 and H2 (blue) from GuK contain a surplus of positive charges and are located in spatial proximity at the surface of SH3-hinge-GuK unit (Figs. 1 and 2F). At the molecular surface of the ZO-1-SH3-hinge-GuK unit they form a large area of positive electrostatic potential (Fig. 2E).Occludin and α-Catenin Interact with ZO-1 via the Same EpitopesTo prove the hypothesis of a common interaction mechanism between occludin and ZO-1 and α-catenin and ZO-1, we analyzed constructs that were systematically varied according to the secondary structural elements in binding studies using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Occludin406–521, comprising the predicted coiled-coil domain, exhibited one pure band after purification and SDS-PAGE, suggesting a stable/correctly folded structure. Deletion mutants of occludin406–521 comprising Oc-Ha, Oc-Hb, Oc-CCa, Oc-CCb, and Oc-Hc bound to ZO-1589–772 (Fig. 3A) and other ZO-1 fragments (Fig. 3B). However, N-terminal extension of occludin coiled-coil domain lacking structure predictions (occludin378–405) strongly decreased the ZO-1 binding, probably by masking the binding site. We observed also that the complete C-terminal tail occludin264–521 was unstable. N-terminal deletion of Oc-Ha and Oc-Hb from occludin coiled-coil domain led to decreased binding. Truncation of Oc-Hc at the C-terminal side led to an increase of binding to ZO-1-GuK fragments. Further C-terminal deletion indicated that the essential binding region is defined by occludin406–488 comprising Oc-Ha, Oc-Hb, Oc-CCa, and Oc-CCb (Fig. 3A). Comparison of ZO-1 constructs spanning different regions around GuK emphasized the importance of the ZO-1 features CC1 in the hinge region and of H1 and H2 in GuK for the association with occludin. C-terminal truncations excluding ZO-1-CC2 from GuK increased the binding to occludin. A possible reason for this is that the acidic residues after β-strand F in the C-terminal tail of GuK may mask the basic patch of GuK for interaction (Fig. 1C). The maximum binding intensity to all occludin constructs was obtained with ZO-1589–772 (Fig. 3B). To test binding of ZO-1 to α-catenin we used α-catenin1–508 and catenin509–906 corresponding to VH1 plus the first portion of VH2 and the second four-helix bundle of VH2 plus VH3, respectively. In addition, α-catenin631–766, a truncated construct from VH3 comprising a sequence with a CC prediction and similarity to occludin, was also tested (Fig. 3B). But the best binding was observed with the larger construct α-catenin509–906. Less ZO-1 binding for the truncated construct α-catenin631–766 indicates that not the CC-region alone, but the complete helix bundle structure of VH3, is necessary for the interaction. ZO-1 binding to α-catenin1–508 (VH1, first half VH2 region) was weaker than to α-catenin509–906 (second half VH2, VH3 region) that corresponds to the findings that within VH1 contains no significant CC probabilities were predicted. The order of binding strength of the analyzed ZO-"

We investigated the effect of lycopene in normal prostate tissue to gain insight into the mechanisms, by which lycopene can contribute to primary prostate cancer prevention. We supplemented young rats with 200 ppm lycopene for up to 8 wk, measured the uptake into individual prostate lobes, and analyzed lycopene-induced gene regulations in dorsal and lateral lobes after 8 wk of supplementation. Lycopene accumulated in all four prostate lobes over time, with all-trans lycopene being the predominant isoform. The lateral lobe showed a significantly higher total lycopene content than the other prostate lobes. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that lycopene treatment mildly but significantly reduced gene expression of androgen-metabolizing enzymes and androgen targets. Moreover, local expression of IGF-I was decreased in the lateral lobe. Lycopene also consistently reduced transcript levels of proinflammatory cytokines, immunoglobulins, and immunoglobulin receptors in the lateral lobe. This indicates that lycopene reduced inflammatory signals in the lateral prostate lobe. In summary, we show for the first time that lycopene reduced local prostatic androgen signaling, IGF-I expression, and basal inflammatory signals in normal prostate tissue. All of these mechanisms can contribute to the epidemiologically observed prostate cancer risk reduction by lycopene."
https://openalex.org/W2150622572,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a cytoprotective protein that catalyzes the degradation of heme to biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). In the present study, we found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by a variety of experimental agents stimulated a time- and concentration-dependent increase in HO-1 mRNA and protein in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). The induction of HO-1 by ER stress was blocked by actinomycin D or cycloheximide and was independent of any changes in HO-1 mRNA stability. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that ER stress stimulated HO-1 promoter activity via the antioxidant response element. Moreover, ER stress induced the nuclear import of Nrf2 and the binding of Nrf2 to the HO-1 antioxidant response element. Interestingly, ER stress stimulated SMC apoptosis, as demonstrated by annexin V binding, caspase-3 activation, and DNA laddering. The induction of apoptosis by ER stress was potentiated by HO inhibition, whereas it was prevented by addition of HO substrate. In addition, exposure of SMC to exogenously administered CO inhibited ER stress-mediated apoptosis, and this was associated with a decrease in the expression of the proapoptotic protein, GADD153. In contrast, the other HO-1 products failed to block apoptosis or GADD153 expression during ER stress. These results demonstrated that ER stress is an inducer of HO-1 gene expression in vascular SMC and that HO-1-derived CO acts in an autocrine fashion to inhibit SMC apoptosis.

Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Gazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2873) Google Scholar, 16Llesuy S.F. Tomaro M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In addition, HO-1 induction is accompanied by increased ferritin activity, which exerts an additional antioxidant effect by chelating free iron (17Vile G.F. Tyrell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14678-14681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, HO-1 liberates the diatomic gas CO that possesses significant anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties (18Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Lu TaoH. Wysk M. Davis R.J.

Res. 2002; 55: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a dynamic membranous organelle that plays a critical role in the folding, transport, and processing of newly synthesized proteins (21Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 22Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Numerous infectious agents, environmental toxins, and adverse metabolic conditions interfere with protein folding leading to ER stress. To protect against ER stress, the ER has evolved highly specific signaling pathways collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). Three ER-resident transmembrane proteins, the kinase and endoribonuclease IRE1, the PERK kinase, and the basic leucine-zipper transcription factor ATF6, have been identified as proximal sensors of ER stress (23Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25935-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Activation of these sensors results in the up-regulation of genes encoding ER chaperone proteins such as GRP78 that increase protein folding activity and prevent protein aggregation. In addition, the UPR results in translation attenuation to reduce the load of protein synthesis and to prevent further accumulation of unfolded proteins. Finally, when ER function is severely impaired, apoptosis is induced. This apoptotic event is triggered by the activation of the proapoptotic transcription factor GADD153 and/or by the activation of ER-associated caspase-12 (24Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar, 25Gotoh T. Oyadomari S. Mori K. Mori M. J. Biol.

Because HO-1 is induced by several forms of cellular stress, the present study examined whether ER stress regulates HO-1 expression. We now report that ER stress is a novel inducer of HO-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). Interestingly, the activation of the HO-1 gene by ER stress does not occur via the conventional UPR-responsive element but rather through the antioxidant-responsive element (ARE). In addition, we have shown that HO-1-derived CO functions in an autocrine manner to suppress apoptosis. The HO-1/CO system may represent an important adaptive mechanism to promote cell survival during periods of ER stress. Materials—Collagenase, elastase, SDS, Tris, Tes, HEPES, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, EDTA, Tween 20, penicillin, streptomycin, dithiothreitol, iron, sucrose, Nonidet P-40, brefeldin A, homocysteine, hemin, thapsigargin, and minimum essential medium were purchased from Sigma. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A were from Roche Applied Science. Biliverdin, bilirubin, zinc protoporphyrin-IX, and tin protoporphyrin-IX were from Frontier Scientific Porphyrin Products (Logan, Utah). MG132 and proteasome inhibitor I were from Calbiochem; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 18 S complementary DNA were from Ambion (Austin, TX). A polyclonal HO-1 antibody and an anti-KDEL monoclonal antibody that recognizes GRP78 were from StressGen Biotechnologies Inc. (Victoria, Canada); anti-GADD153, Nrf2, lamin B1, and β-actin polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A polyclonal procaspase-12 antibody was from Oncogene (San Diego, CA); [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell Culture—Vascular SMC were isolated by elastase and collagenase digestion of rat thoracic aortas and characterized as described previously (27Durante W. Peyton K.J. Schafer A.I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2666-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). SMC were cultured serially in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 mm Tes, 5 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. mRNA and Protein Analysis—mRNA and protein levels were determined by Northern and Western blotting, respectively. Total RNA (30 μg) was fractionated by electrophoresis, blot-transferred to Gene Screen Plus membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and prehybridized for 4 h at 68 °C in hybridization buffer (rapid-hyb buffer; Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized overnight at 68 °C in hybridization buffer containing [32P]DNA probes (1 × 108 cpm) for HO-1, GADD153, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or 18 S RNA. DNA probes were generated by RT-PCR (8Durante W. Kroll M.H. Christodoulides N. Peyton K.J. Schafer A.I. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 28Peyton K.J.

After hybridization, membranes were washed and then exposed to x-ray film at –70 °C in the presence of intensifying screens. Proteins (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (0.1%) and nonfat milk (5%). Blots were incubated with the HO-1 (1:500 dilution), GRP78 (1:200), procaspase-12 (1:200), GADD153 (1:200), lamin B1 (1:100), or β-actin (1:200) antibody for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:7,500) or goat anti-mouse (1:5,000) antibody. After further washing with phosphate-buffered saline, blots were incubated in commercial chemoluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). HO-1 Promoter Analysis—The sequences for the wild-type enhancer SX2 coupled to a minimum HO-1 promoter as well as the mutant enhancer SX2-M739 that had its three ARE core sequences mutated have been described previously (30Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25049-25056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M.K. Burrow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol.

These promoter/luciferase constructs (1 μg/ml), pCMVβ-galactosidase (1 μg/ml), and a plasmid expressing Nrf2 (pEF-F2/Nrf2) were transfected into SMC using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), cultured for an additional 24 h, and then treated with various agents. Cells were then collected, lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega) and a TD-Zoe luminometer (Turner Designs Inc., Mountain View, CA) and normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity. Preparation of Nuclear Extract and Nrf2 Analysis—Cells were scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4% Nonidet P-40), incubated for 10 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10% glycerol), kept on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Nrf2 levels were determined by Western blotting using Nrf2 antibodies (1:100 dilution) as described above. Electromobility Shift Assay—A consensus ARE oligomer containing the sequence 5′TTTATGCTGTGTCATGGTT-3′ (core ARE sequence is underlined) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with 3 μg of nuclear extract for 30 min at room temperature in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide gels run at 220 V for 3 h. In antibody supershift assays, 1 μg of Nrf2 antibody was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C before the addition of the probe. Apoptosis—Apoptosis was monitored by measuring DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and the movement of phosphatidylserine from the internal to the external surface of the cell membrane as we have described previously (20Liu X. Chapman G.B. Peyton K.J. Schafer A.I. Durante W. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 55: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). CO Exposure—SMCs were exposed to CO via a previously described environmental chamber (28Peyton K.J. Reyna S.V. Chapman G.B. Ensenat D. Liu X. Wang H. Schafer A.I. Durante W. Blood. 2002; 99: 4443-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Gas from stock tanks containing 1% CO in air and 5% CO2 in air were combined in a stainless steel mixing cylinder and delivered into a humidified 37 °C environmental chamber. Flow into the chamber was at 1 liter/min; CO levels in the chamber were continuously monitored by electrochemical detection using a CO analyzer (Interscan, Chatsworth, CA). Statistics—Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of a Student's two-tailed t test and an analysis of variance when more than two treatment regimens were compared. p <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Treatment of vascular SMC with brefeldin A, a well established inducer of ER stress that inhibits the translocation of proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (32Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar), stimulated HO-1 mRNA and protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The induction of HO-1 by brefeldin A was delayed, with marked increases in HO-1 mRNA and protein appearing after 24 h of brefeldin A exposure (Fig. 1B). Homocysteine, which promotes protein misfolding in the ER by interfering with disulfide bond formation (21Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), also induced HO-1 protein expression (Fig. 2A). Similarly, thapsigargin, which induces ER stress by inhibiting ER Ca2+-ATPase (33Travers, K. J., Patil, C. K., Wodicka, L., Lockhart, D. J., Weissman, J. S., and Walter, P. Cell 101,249–258Google Scholar), stimulated the expression of HO-1 protein (Fig. 2A). In addition, proteasomal inhibition, a known stimulus for UPR activation (34Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), induced HO-1 expression. Incubation of SMC with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and proteasome inhibitor I increased HO-1 protein expression (Fig. 2B). The induction of ER stress by all of these agents was confirmed by the significant increase in the level of GRP78 (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2Endoplasmic reticulum stress stimulates HO-1 and GRP78 expression in vascular SMC.A, SMC were treated with brefeldin A (BF; 1 μm), homocysteine (Hcy; 3 mm), or thapsigargin (Thaps; 4 μm) for 24 h, and HO-1 and GRP78 protein were determined by Western blotting. B, SMC were exposed to the proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 (0–30 μm) or proteasome inhibitor I (PI-I; 0–30 μm) for 24 h, and HO-1 and GRP78 protein were determined by Western blotting. Similar findings were observed in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the next series of experiments the molecular mechanism by which ER stress induces HO-1 expression was examined. Incubation of SMC with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D blocked the induction of HO-1 mRNA and protein by brefeldin A (Fig. 3A). To test for a possible role of mRNA stability in the induction of HO-1 by brefeldin A, SMC were treated with actinomycin D, and the decay of HO-1 message followed. These actinomycin D chase experiments revealed that HO-1 mRNA has a half-life of ∼2 h (Fig. 3B). However, the stability of HO-1 transcripts was unaffected by brefeldin. To determine whether increases in HO-1 expression in response to ER stress involve transcriptional activation of the gene, SMC were transiently transfected with a HO-1 promoter construct and promoter activity was monitored. Cadmium, an established activator of the HO-1 promoter (31Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M.K. Burrow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), induced an ∼6-fold increase in promoter activity (Fig. 3C). Brefeldin A and the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 also stimulated more than a 2-fold increase in promoter activity (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the expression of Nrf2 induced a significant increase in HO-1 promoter activity (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, mutation of the AREs attenuated basal activity and abolished the response to cadmium, brefeldin A, proteasome inhibition, and Nrf2 (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that ER stress activates HO-1 transcription via the ARE. Electromobility shift assays using an ARE probe corresponding to the mouse HO-1 promoter detected a complex that was significantly increased in intensity by the ER stress inducers, brefeldin A, thapsigargin, and homocysteine (Fig. 4A). Because the transcription factor Nrf2 appears crucial for ARE-mediated gene expression (Fig. 3C) (35Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar), we investigated whether ER stress stimulated the binding of Nrf2 to the ARE. Indeed, supershift electromobility shift assay reactions using an antibody directed against Nrf2 retarded the migration of the ARE complex (Fig. 4A), indicating the presence of Nrf2 in the ARE-nuclear protein complex (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the activation of Nrf2 by homocysteine (Fig. 4B) and other ER stress agents was corroborated by the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. In subsequent experiments the functional role of HO-1 during ER stress was examined. Treatment of SMC with homocysteine resulted in a significant increase in the rate of apoptosis as reflected by annexin V binding (Fig. 5). However, the addition of the HO inhibitors, zinc protoporphyrin-IX or tin protoporphyrin-IX, increased homocysteine-mediated apoptosis by ∼2-fold. These findings suggested that the induction of HO-1 by ER stress may function in an autocrine manner to inhibit SMC apoptosis. Subsequently, we determined which of the HO-1 products mediates this cytoprotective effect. Incubation of vascular SMC with brefeldin A or thapsigargin for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in caspase-3 activity that was reversed by the exogenous administration of CO (200 ppm) (Fig. 6A). Similarly, the stimulation of DNA fragmentation by brefeldin A, thapsigargin, or homocysteine was prevented by CO (Fig. 6, B and C). In contrast, the addition of the bile pigments, biliverdin or bilirubin, or free iron had no effect on DNA laddering (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, increasing endogenous CO production via the exogenous addition of hemin blocked brefeldin A-mediated DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6E).Fig. 6Carbon monoxide inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in vascular SMC.A, SMC were treated with brefeldin A (BF; 1 μm) or thapsigargin (Thaps; 4 μm) for 24 h in the presence or absence of carbon monoxide (CO; 200 ppm), and caspase-3 activity was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of four separate experiments. *, statistically significant effect of BF or Thaps. +, statistically significant effect of CO. B, SMC were treated with BF (1 μm) or Thaps (4 μm) for 24 h in the presence or absence of CO (200 ppm) and DNA laddering as described under “Materials and Methods.” Similar findings were observed in three separate experiments. C, SMC were treated with homocysteine (Hcy; 3 mm) for 48 h in the presence or absence of CO (200 ppm). Similar findings were observed in three separate experiments. D, SMC were treated with BF (1 μm) for 24 h in the presence or absence of either biliverdin (5 μm), bilirubin (5 μm), or iron (5 μm), and DNA laddering was measured. Similar findings were observed in four separate experiments. E, SMC were treated with BF (1 μm) for 24 h in the presence or absence of hemin (10 μm), and DNA laddering was measured. Similar findings were observed in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, we investigated the effect of CO on specific pathways that promote apoptosis during ER stress. In particular, we examined whether CO regulates the activity of caspase-12 or the expression of GADD153 because both these proteins have been implicated in the induction of apoptosis by ER stress (24Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar, 25Gotoh T. Oyadomari S. Mori K. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12343-12350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 26McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrock N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Incubation of vascular SMC with brefeldin A stimulated the processing of procaspase-12. Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant decline in procaspase-12 levels following 24 h of brefeldin exposure (Fig. 7A) that paralleled the onset of apoptosis. However, the application of CO (200 ppm) had no effect on the activation of caspase-12 by brefeldin A (Fig. 7A). In contrast, CO markedly attenuated the increase in GADD153 protein expression induced by brefeldin A or homocysteine (Fig. 7B). Moreover, CO blocked the time-dependent induction of GADD153 mRNA by homocysteine (Fig. 7C). The other HO-1 products failed to inhibit GADD153 expression (data not shown). In the present study, we identified ER stress as a novel inducer of HO-1 gene expression in vascular SMC. We found that HO-1 is induced by a diverse set of conditions that cause ER stress, including inhibition of protein transport, calcium depletion, homocysteine exposure, and protein accumulation. Furthermore, we discovered that the induction of HO-1 inhibits SMC apoptosis during ER stress via the release of CO. These findings implicate the HO-1/CO system as a critical modulator of cell survival during periods of ER stress. Our finding that ER stress stimulates HO-1 gene expression in SMC extended an earlier study showing that thapsigargin induces a marked rise in HO-1 mRNA in primary neuronal cells (36Linden T. Doutheil J. Paschen W. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, the induction of HO-1 by homocysteine in cultured cells is also consistent with the increase in HO-1 expression observed in a murine model of hyperhomocysteinemia (37Robert K. Chasse J-F. Santiard-Baron D. Vayssettes C. Chabli A. Aupetit J. Maeda N. Kamoun P. London J. Janel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31504-31511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, ER stress fails to stimulate HO-1 expression in cultured hepatoma cells (38Chang S-H. Barbosa-Tessman I. Chen C. Kilberg M.S. Agarwal A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1933-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The dissimilar results between these studies may reflect differences in cell type, culture conditions, or duration and extent of ER stress. Interestingly, a recent report (39Majors A.K. de la Austin R.C. Motte C.A. Pyeritz R.E. Hascal V.C. Kessler S.P. Sen G. Strong S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47223-47231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) found that ER stress promotes hyaluronan deposition and leukocyte adhesion to SMC, demonstrating that SMC represent a physiologically relevant cellular target of ER stress. ER stress induces HO-1 expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The induction of HO-1 by ER stress is dependent on de novo RNA synthesis and does not involve alterations in HO-1 mRNA stability. Transient transfection experiments indicate that ER stress stimulates the transcriptional activation of the HO-1 gene. However, the activation of HO-1 transcription by ER stress does not occur via the classical mammalian UPR element (5′-CCAAT-N9-CCACG-3′). A computer search of the entire 15 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse HO-1 gene failed to detect any candidate UPR elements. Similarly, computer analysis of a BAC clone sequence (GenBank™ accession number Z82244) containing the entire human HO-1 gene and greater than 20 kb of the 5′-flanking region did not reveal a UPR element (38Chang S-H. Barbosa-Tessman I. Chen C. Kilberg M.S. Agarwal A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1933-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Instead, ER stress induces HO-1 transcription via the ARE. Electromobility shift assays found increased ARE binding in nuclear extracts from SMC exposed to ER stress. Moreover, when the ARE element is mutated, the stimulation of HO-1 promoter activity by ER stress is completely abrogated. Many nuclear transcription factors have been reported to bind to the ARE. However, recent work indicates that the transcription factor Nrf2 plays a critical role in ARE-dependent HO-1 gene expression (35Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we found that stimulation of HO-1 promoter activity in vascular SMC by Nrf2 is dependent on the presence of AREs in the promoter. Furthermore, we detected Nrf2 binding to the HO-1 ARE in SMC following exposure to ER stress. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is retained in the cytoplasm via its binding to the cytosolic protein Keap1 (40Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar). However, changes in cellular redox potential and/or phosphorylation of Nrf2 lead to the release of Nrf2 from Keap1 and its translocation to the nucleus, resulting in ARE-mediated gene transcription (40Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar, 41Huang H.C. Nyugen T. Picket C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that ER stress induces the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus of vascular SMC. This finding is supported by a recent study showing that ER stress triggers the nuclear import of Nrf2 in embryonic fibroblasts (42Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannick M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7198-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The activation of Nrf2 appears to involve the ER signaling protein, PERK, which has been shown to phosphorylate and activate Nrf2 in response to ER stress conditions (43Cullinan S.B. Diehl J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20108-20117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest a model where PERK activation in response to ER stress stimulates the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 where it complexes with the ARE in the HO-1 promoter to trigger gene expression. HO-1 exerts important cytoprotective actions in response to numerous cellular insults, (7Motterlini R. Foresti R. Intaglietta M. Winslow R.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

The induction of HO-1 by ER stress contributes to cell survival because inhibition of HO activity augments apoptosis, whereas addition of a HO substrate prevents apoptosis during ER stress. The anti-apoptotic effect of HO-1 is likely mediated via the release of CO because the exogenous administration of CO mimics the cytoprotection afforded by HO-1. In contrast, the other HO-1 products do not protect cells from undergoing apoptosis. CO has no effect on the activation of the ER-specific caspase-12 by ER stress, but it markedly blunts the expression of the proapoptotic transcription factor, GADD153. Interestingly, cells with a targeted deletion of Nrf2 exhibit elevated levels of GADD153 and reduced survival following ER stress relative to wild-type cells (41Huang H.C. Nyugen T. Picket C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 42Cullinan S.B. Zhang D. Hannick M. Arvisais E. Kaufman R.J. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell.

It is tempting to speculate that HO-1-derived CO synthesis contributes to the repression of GADD153 expression and increased survival in the wild-type cells. Recent studies indicate that ER stress may also activate the intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (death receptor) signaling pathways to trigger apoptosis (44Jimbo A. Fujita E. Kouroko Y.

Thus, the induction of HO-1 and the release of CO during ER stress may represent an important survival response in providing cells additional time to execute the UPR and restore ER function. In addition, HO-1-derived CO leads to cell cycle arrest (28Peyton K.J. Reyna S.V. Chapman G.B. Ensenat D. Liu X. Wang H. Schafer A.I. Durante W.

The ability of HO-1-derived CO to block ER stress-mediated apoptosis may be of clinical significance. ER stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. Cell death following ER stress is believed to contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson disease and to the loss of pancreatic β cells in diabetes (49Kudo T.

Hamada J. Fukuuchi Y. Neuroscience. 2003; 118: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, damage to vascular cells by ER stress in hyperhomocysteinemic states promotes the development of atherosclerosis (53Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Pfiefer S.I Pamidi S. Podor T.J. Li J.

Thus, approaches that target HO-1 or CO to sites of ER stress offer a promising therapeutic modality in treating a variety of disorders related to ER stress. In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that ER stress induces HO-1 gene expression in vascular SMC and that HO-1-catalyzed CO formation inhibits apoptosis during ER stress. In addition, it has shown that the anti-apoptotic effect of CO is associated with a decrease in GADD153 expression. The HO-1/CO system represents a potentially new therapeutic target in ameliorating diseases associated with ER stress."

Live cell microscopy studies suggest that MreB molecules organize into large filamentous spirals that support the cell membrane and play a key shape-determining function. However, the basic properties of MreB filament assembly remain unknown. Here, we studied the assembly of Thermotoga maritima MreB triggered by ATP in vitro and compared it to the wellstudied assembly of actin. These studies show that MreB filament ultrastructure and polymerization depend crucially on temperature as well as the ions present on solution. At the optimal growth temperature of T. maritima, MreB assembly proceeded much faster than that of actin, without nucleation (or nucleation is highly favorable and fast) and with little or no contribution from filament end-to-end annealing. MreB exhibited rates of ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release similar to that of F-actin, however, with a critical concentration of ∼3nm, which is ∼100-fold lower than that of actin. Furthermore, MreB assembled into filamentous bundles that have the ability to spontaneously form ring-like structures without auxiliary proteins.

The existence of an extended bacterial cytoskeleton was in doubt until recently. The discovery of intracellular filamentous protein assemblies with cell shape-defining functions has changed our view of the bacterium subcellular organization. In particular, the structural similarities between the protein MreB and its ubiquitous eukaryotic counterpart actin (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Lowe J.

The bacterial cytoskeleton also comprises FtsZ, the prokaryotic homolog of tubulin (5Bi E.F. Lutkenhaus J.

Based on homology in amino acid sequences, several bacterial proteins are believed to belong to the actin family. These proteins include the cell division protein FtsA (7van den Ent F. Lowe J.

Among the known actin-like bacterial proteins, MreB is the most homologous to actin in amino acid sequence, structure, and size (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Upon addition of ATP to a MreB solution, MreB molecules polymerize to form single-stranded protofilaments (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), as opposed to actin which forms double-stranded filaments. While the in vivo functions of MreB are being actively explored, remarkably little is known about its mechanism of assembly. For instance, it is unknown whether MreB assembly is faster than F-actin 1The abbreviations used are: F-actin, filamentous actin; EM, electron microscopy. assembly given the typically much shorter life-cycle of bacteria compared with mammalian cells. While ATP promotes MreB assembly (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether MreB catalyzes ATP hydrolysis in a manner similar to F-actin. Live cell microscopy studies show that MreB molecules assemble into large filamentous spirals that lie under the cell membrane and span the cell length (2Jones L.J. Carballido-Lopez R. Errington J.

When MreB is depleted, rod-shaped Caulobacter crescentus cells become lemonshaped (3Figge R.M. Divakaruni A.V. Gober J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and Bacillus subtilis cells become more rounded (2Jones L.J. Carballido-Lopez R. Errington J. Cell. 2001; 104: 913-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), which both underlie the important mechanical function of MreB (2Jones L.J. Carballido-Lopez R.

In addition to its structural function, MreB is also involved in bacterial chromosomal segregation (16Kruse T. Moller-Jensen J. Lobner-Olesen A. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5283-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the mechanism and regulation of actin assembly as well as F-actin organization into orthogonal arrays and ordered bundles in cytoplasm have been studied extensively (17Heidemann S.R. Wirtz D. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 160-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Kole T.P. Tseng Y. Huang L. Katz J.L. Wirtz D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3475-3484Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the assembly mechanism of MreB has yet to be explored. Because Thermotoga maritima is an extreme thermophilic anaerobic eubacteria with optimum growth temperature above 65 °C (19Londei P. Altamura S. Huber R. Stetter K.O. Cammarano P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4353-4360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the polymerization kinetics of T. maritima MreB in vitro and determined the basic parameters of its assembly at 65 °C. Using multiple-angle light scattering, we assessed in real time the rigidity and ultrastructure of MreB in solution during assembly. These light scattering studies were complemented by electron microscopy (EM) imaging of MreB filamentous structures. Our studies suggest that MreB filament assembly is not nucleated (or nucleation is highly favorable and fast) and show that MreB polymerizes much more rapidly than actin. Further, these studies suggest that MreB catalyzes ATP hydrolysis and releases phosphate (Pi) at a rate similar to that of F-actin. Purification of T. maritima MreB—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. A pHis17 vector-derived construct containing the T. maritima MreB gene was kindly supplied by Dr. Fusinita van den Ent. The purification of T. maritima MreB follows van den Ent et al. (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) protocol. Briefly, Escherichia coli C41(DE3) cells transformed by the MreB gene containing vector were inoculated at 37 °C in 2× YT medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until an OD600 of 0.6 and was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The cells were spun down at 6,000 × g for 15 min, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –20 °C for further use. Upon purifying the MreB protein, cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing lysozyme. The mixture was sonicated and DNase I was added. The mixture was centrifuged (150,000 × g) for 1 h, and the supernatant was further purified using a Ni2+-NTA affinity column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The column was washed with wash buffer composed of 95% buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 5% buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 m imidazole), and then eluted with elution buffer composed of 70% buffer A and 30% buffer B. Fractions containing MreB were concentrated and gel-filtrated using Sephacryl S-300 resin (Sigma). The purified protein was dialyzed into polymerization buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl) and centrifuged (150,000 × g) for 1 h before use. Actin Purification and Assembly—Chicken skeletal muscle actin was prepared according to MacLean-Fletcher and Pollard (20MacLean-Fletcher S.D. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) with an added gel filtration step using Sephacryl S-300 (21Tseng Y. An K.M. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Purified actin was continuously dialyzed at 4 °C against buffer G (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium azide, and 0.2 mm CaCl2). Mg2+-actin filaments were generated by adding 0.1 volume of 10× KMEI (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) polymerizing salt to 0.9 volume of G-actin in buffer G. Electron Microscopy—MreB was incubated in polymerization buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl) with 2 mm ATP at 65 °C. For each specimen, 10 μl of the mixture was placed on an electron microscopic grid coated with a collodion film. The grids were washed with three drops of polymerization buffer and stained with 2% uranyl acetate solution. The excess stain was drained off the grid at a 45° angle on a filter paper and dried. Electron microscopy was performed at the Integrated Imaging Center in Johns Hopkins University with a Philips 410 transmission electron microscope at magnification between ×65,000 and ×105,000. Time-resolved Light Scattering—Time-resolved multiple-angle light scattering (Wyatt Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) was used to monitor the assembly of MreB and actin. A beam of a 5 milliwatt He-Ne laser (wavelength λ0 = 632.8 nm) was incident upon the protein solution contained in a glass vial (sample volume, 5 ml). The background light intensity from the buffer was independently measured and subtracted from the measured light intensities as described previously (22Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We report the time-dependent light intensity measured at 90° from the axis of incident light. Protein concentration was varied from 0.05 to 6 μm. All experiments were conducted at 65 °C unless otherwise stated. The scattered light intensity was measured simultaneously by 18 photodiodes arranged circularly around the scattering volume. We also report the light intensity, I(q), as a function of the scattering vector amplitude, q = (4π n/λ0) sin(θ/2). The q-dependent scattering light intensity profiles were fitted to a power law I(q) ∼q–a. The exponent a reflects the structure of the “scatterers” in solution. The spectrum I(q) is independent of q when the scatterers are much smaller than the length scales probed by the instrument (0.25–1.22 μm). This length scale is larger than individual MreB monomers but smaller than steady state MreB filamentous bundles. However, because extracting morphological information from scattering spectra is an inverse problem (i.e. different structures can have the same spectrum I(q)), there are typically multiple possible morphologies consistent with a given q-dependent spectrum. Hence, we used time-resolved EM to complement these multiple-angle light scattering measurements. Phosphate Release Assay—The production of inorganic phosphate by MreB was measured using the malachite green-sodium molybdate assay (23Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 24Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Polymerization of MreB was initiated by the addition of ATP at 65 °C. At 1-min time intervals, the reaction was quenched with one volume of cold 0.6 m perchloric acid and stored on ice until all time points were collected. Two volumes of filtered malachite green solution (0.15 g of malachite green, 1 g of sodium molybdate, 0.25 g of Triton X-100 in 500 ml of 0.7 m HCl) were added to the samples, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and absorbance measured at OD650 using a precision microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The curves were normalized with a phosphate standard and a control without protein. The Polymerization of T. maritima MreB Is Temperature-dependent—T. maritima performs its biological function in a high temperature environment (19Londei P. Altamura S. Huber R. Stetter K.O. Cammarano P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4353-4360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hecht K. Wrba A. Jaenicke R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); therefore we studied the effect of temperature on the polymerization of MreB. We monitored the time-dependent intensity of the light scattered from MreB solutions at an angle of 90° and temperatures ranging between 25 and 65 °C (Fig. 1). Polymerization was triggered by addition of ATP to MreB solutions (2 μm MreB). At 25 °C, we detected no light scattering over the background light scattering from buffer, even 2 h after addition of ATP (data not shown). At 37 °C, light scattering increased after a long lag phase of > 40 min and to low intensity levels (Fig. 1, inset). This lag phase was significantly reduced at 50 °C and completely eliminated at 65 °C (Fig. 1). The steady state scattering intensity at 65 °C was ∼ 70 times of that at 37 °C and the rate of polymerization (as measured by the inverse of the time to reach 90% of the steady state intensity) was much higher at 65 °C than at 37 °C (Fig. 1). It was essential to determine whether the increase in the rate of MreB polymerization resulted merely from the expected enhanced kinetics of assembly at high temperature. EM showed mostly small amorphous aggregates and very few filamentous structures at 37 °C (data not shown). In contrast, at 65 °C, EM showed well-developed filamentous bundles (see more below, Fig. 2). Therefore, subsequent MreB experiments were conducted at 65 °C, which is within the temperature range for optimal growth of T. maritima (19Londei P. Altamura S. Huber R. Stetter K.O. Cammarano P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4353-4360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hecht K. Wrba A. Jaenicke R. Eur. J.

At 65 °C, light scattering increased rapidly after addition of ATP, even at an MreB concentration as low as 0.05 μm (Fig. 2A, inset), a concentration at which actin (at 37 °C) in polymerization buffer generated no excess scattering above background scattering from buffer. Light scattering showed little or no lag phase at high concentrations (≥ 1 μm) (Fig. 2A), and a short time lag at low concentrations (≤ 1 μm). The extent of this lag was independent of MreB concentration (Fig. 2A, inset). However, the rate of scattering increase and the scattering intensity at steady state increased greatly with MreB concentration (Fig. 2A). For concentrations ≥ 1 μm, MreB polymerization was much faster than actin polymerization, and the scattered light intensity reached a plateau value within minutes (Fig. 2B). Steady state light scattering from polymerized MreB solutions was significantly higher than that from F-actin solutions at the same protein concentration (Fig. 2B and inset). These light scattering results were complemented by electron micrographs (Fig. 2, C and D). We conducted time-resolved EM at a fixed concentration of 14 μm MreB. Two minutes after adding ATP, EM revealed that MreB formed short filamentous bundles (Fig. 2C), which increased in length and density with time. After 15 min, MreB filamentous structures consisted of straight and curved bundles as well as closed rings (Fig. 2C). At a fixed elapsed time of 15 min, EM showed that MreB formed mostly single filaments with few thin short bundles at a concentration of 0.5 μm. At high concentrations, instead of single filaments, thicker and longer filamentous bundles, and rings were observed (Fig. 2D). The Critical Concentration for MreB Polymerization Is Much Lower Than That of F-actin—To determine the critical concentration required for MreB assembly, the steady state scattering intensity was plotted as a function of the total concentration of MreB in solution (Fig. 3A). An estimate of the critical concentration was obtained by extrapolating this plot to zero intensity. A linear fit of the concentration-dependent intensity suggested a critical concentration of ∼3 nm. A similar analysis for actin suggested a critical concentration of ∼ 0.25 μm (Fig. 3B), which is between the critical concentrations of its barbed end and pointed end (26Nishida E. Sakai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MreB Catalyzes ATP Hydrolysis—Phosphate release from MreB was investigated to determine whether MreB polymerization is accompanied by ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 4). In the phosphate release assay, a concentration of 100 μm ATP was used to induce MreB polymerization; thereafter the production of inorganic phosphate was measured at 1-min intervals for a wide range of MreB concentrations (Fig. 4, inset). For MreB concentrations ≥ 1 μm, the difference in phosphate release between MreB solutions and control solutions without proteins became significant. This phosphate release spectrum suggests that MreB catalyzes ATP hydrolysis. A time lag between phosphate release and MreB polymerization (Fig. 4, inset) suggests that ATP hydrolysis might occur after MreB monomers incorporate into filaments. The rate of phosphate release per mole of MreB was independent of MreB concentration for MreB concentrations ≥ 1 μm (Fig. 4), with a maximum rate of 0.10 ± 0.01 mol Pi/min/mole MreB (average ± S.D. of six experiments). Filament Annealing Does Not Contribute Significantly to MreB Assembly—To determine whether filament end-to-end annealing contributes significantly to overall MreB assembly, the scattering intensity from MreB filament solutions was monitored before and after mechanical shearing (Fig. 5A). When the scattering intensity reached a plateau, the solution was briefly subjected to vigorous shear (Fig. 5A, phase I), and light scattering was immediately re-monitored. As expected, light scattering dropped significantly after shear (Fig. 5A, phase II). Filamentous bundles (Fig. 5B, panel I) were broken down to smaller filaments as confirmed by EM (Fig. 5B, panel II). But light scattering failed to recover even in the presence of fresh ATP (Fig. 5A, phase III). The length and structure of the short bundles remained unchanged even 40 min after shear (Fig. 5B, panel III). These results exclude filament end-to-end annealing as a major contributor to MreB assembly. A control experiment was performed with an actin filament solution. For actin, the scattering intensity dropped 50% right after shear but recovered (slowly) to 75% of its original scattering intensity upon addition of ATP (Fig. 5A, inset). This result agrees with previous studies that show that filament end-to-end annealing contributes significantly to actin assembly (27Murphy D.B. Gray R.O. Grasser W.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Andrianantoandro E. Blanchoin L. Sept D. McCammon J.A. Pollard T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). MreB Filaments Display Different Morphologies—Real-time morphology of filamentous MreB during assembly was investigated using time-resolved multiple-angle light scattering. The time-dependent scattered light intensities, I(t; θ), was probed simultaneously by 18 photodetectors placed at different angles, θ, around the glass vial containing the specimen. At a fixed elapsed time after addition of ATP, the apparent rigidity of MreB filamentous structures in solution is indicated by the exponent, a, of the power-law fit of the light scattering profiles, I(t; q) ∼q–a(t). The vector amplitude, q, is defined as q = (4π n/λ0) sin(θ/2) (see “Materials and Methods”). The predicted exponent for a highly flexible polymer is 2, for which I(q) ∼q–2, and 3–4 for sheets and smooth surfaces of three-dimensional objects, for which I(q) ∼q–3 or 4 (45Higgins J.S. Benoit H.C. Polymers and Neutron Scattering. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 141-191Google Scholar). Actin exhibits an exponent of 1.1 (22Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The scattered light intensity of polymerized MreB exhibited a q-dependent spectrum (Fig. 6A). At early times, for a wide range of MreB concentrations, the exponent a was ∼1.5 (Fig. 6B). This suggests that even at early times after initiation of polymerization, MreB formed mostly semi-flexible filaments. At 15 min, the exponent increased to 2.1 for 0.5 μm, 3.2 for 2 μm, and 4.0 for 6 μm, respectively (see “Discussion”). We complemented these multiple-angle light scattering results with electron micrographs, which showed that MreB organized into filamentous bundles. Sometimes the filamentous bundles became curved, turning into closed ring structures (Fig. 7, A and B). The average thickness of the filamentous bundles in the rings was ∼4 times the diameter of an MreB filament. This 4-filament thickness could be interpreted as either a 4-filament sheet or a stacked three-dimensional structure of tightly packed filaments. A survey of 112 rings revealed that these rings displayed a relatively uniform diameter of 160 ± 4 nm (mean ± S.E.) (Fig. 7C). The Rate of MreB Polymerization Is Cation-dependent— Since calcium and magnesium affect greatly the rate and extent of polymerization of actin, we studied the effects of these cations on MreB polymerization (Fig. 8). Calcium slowed down the rate of light scattering increase (Fig. 8A). This cation effect was reproduced in the presence of magnesium ions, except that there was little difference in the steady state scattering intensity between 1 and 4 mm magnesium (Fig. 8B). The rate of polymerization, defined by the inverse of the time required to reach 90% of the plateau intensity of scattered light, was significantly reduced in the presence of millimolar of either calcium or magnesium (Fig. 8, C and D). Thus, calcium and magnesium decrease the rate of MreB polymerization. Analysis of the multiple-angle light scattering showed that, at the same elapsed time (15 min), the power law fit of exponent a of the I(q) profiles in the presence of 1 mm or 4 mm of calcium and magnesium were lower than that in the control solution. At the same scattering intensity (0.5 a.u.), the exponent a was over 2 in the presence of cation ions, whereas that of control solution was below 2. This suggests that the formation of higher ordered MreB filamentous bundles was favored in solutions containing a millimolar range of magnesium or calcium. In this report, the assembly properties, ultrastructure, and ATP hydrolysis of T. maritima MreB were studied as a function of concentration and in the absence/presence of calcium and magnesium. To eliminate potential contaminants, MreB was purified through a filtration column after affinity purification. EM and multiple-angle light scattering show that, without accessory proteins, polymerized MreB forms predominantly filamentous bundles. Filament annealing does not contribute significantly to the overall assembly of MreB filaments. Light scattering measurements suggest that the critical concentration for MreB polymerization is ∼3 nm, which is ∼100 times lower than the critical concentration for actin polymerization. Besides filamentous bundles, MreB spontaneously forms ring-like structures with a relatively narrow distribution of radii. In addition, MreB catalyzes ATP hydrolysis, and the phosphate release rate from MreB is comparable to that from F-actin. MreB Assembly Is Much Faster Than F-actin Assembly—A bacterium contains about 8,000 MreB molecules (2Jones L.J. Carballido-Lopez R. Errington J. Cell. 2001; 104: 913-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), which corresponds to an intracellular concentration of 0.2 mg/ml (5.6 μm) in vivo. At concentrations around this physiological concentration, we studied T. maritima MreB assembly using time-resolved light scattering, an approach used recently to investigate the assembly kinetics of bacterial FtsZ, the prokaryotic homolog of tubulin (24Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11743-11753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 29Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We find that the ultrastructure and polymerization kinetics of T. maritima MreB depends greatly on temperature. This is not surprising since T. maritima is a thermophilic bacterium, with an optimum growth temperature between 65 and 80 °C (19Londei P. Altamura S. Huber R. Stetter K.O. Cammarano P. J.

The liver is one of few organs that retains the capacity to rapidly respond to changes in mass and/or function in both humans and animals. This property has significant implications for a variety of clinical situations, including surgical removal of a portion of the liver, such as that which occurs following tumor resection or living-related liver transplantation and for recovery from fulminant liver failure. In contrast to the synchronous and extensive loss of liver mass that occurs in surgical contexts and acute liver failure, the majority of human liver diseases are characterized by repetitive inflammatory or toxic insults to the liver that are associated with loss of liver cells as the result of necrotic or apoptotic cell death. As a consequence of repetitive injury, proliferative signals to hepatocytes are associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanisms that regulate both normal and pathologic proliferation are still poorly understood. A widely used experimental model of hepatic growth is the partial hepatectomy model in rodents in which ∼70% of the liver is removed and restoration of liver mass occurs within 10-14 days (1Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). Within 30 min of the surgery, cytokine and growth factor stimulation leads to the activation of preexisting transcription factors, including NFκB, Stat3, AP-1, and C/EBPβ, and induction of a large number of genes responsible for stimulating normally quiescent hepatocytes and nonparenchymal liver cells to reenter the cell cycle and ultimately restore the liver mass (2Fausto N.

Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The genes that are either increased from basal levels of expression or are induced de novo encode proteins involved in maintaining homeostasis and stimulating cells to reenter the cell cycle and proliferate. In a model proposed by Fausto (2Fausto N. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there appear to be at least two distinct phases of liver regeneration that are regulated via different mechanisms: a priming phase in which quiescent hepatocytes are induced to reenter the cell cycle as a result of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 6 stimulation, followed by a second phase in which hepatocytes respond to growth factors and progress through the G1 stage of the cell cycle (2Fausto N. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The priming phase in the rodent hepatectomy model in which immediate-early genes are activated corresponds to the first 4 h post-hepatectomy (6Su A.I. Guidotti L.G. Pezacki J.P. Chisari F.V.

The peak of DNA synthesis occurs ∼40 h after resection in the mouse, and the period immediately preceding this is associated with the induction of cell cycle genes, including cyclin D1, fox M1b, cyclin-dependent kinases, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (also known as CDKN1A) (8Albrecht J.H.

However, information regarding the pattern of gene expression in the periods following this immediate early priming phase is still limited. In addition, as a consequence of the complexity and robust nature of the transcriptional changes that occur in response to partial hepatectomy, there remains much to be learned regarding the integration of the products of these genes into the complex signaling and transcriptional hierarchies that result in this highly synchronized regenerative response. In this study, we utilized a cDNA microarray enriched for genes expressed in hepatocytes to profile changes in gene expression in mouse liver cDNA samples isolated 0, 2, 16, and 40 h post-hepatectomy (23Kaestner K.H.

Moreover, these studies have predominantly identified metabolic factors and other highly expressed genes that are easily detected through microarray analysis. In the present study, we highlighted novel approaches to the analysis of microarray data, focusing specifically on key time points during the hepatocyte cell cycle that have previously been overlooked. We leveraged novel computational tools to identify themes and regulatory networks that govern hepatic proliferation in vivo. We demonstrated that this approach identifies even those genes in which expression levels are below the sensitivity limit of microarray analysis, including those encoding growth factors and DNA binding proteins. This paradigm will be generally applicable to other expression data sets of similar or higher complexity. Preparation of Samples—12-16-week-old C57BL6/SV129 mice were subjected to partial hepatectomy as described previously (22Greenbaum L.E. Li W. Cressman D. Peng Y. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Taub R. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The animals were sacrificed, and RNA was prepared from the remaining liver lobes taken from mice at 0, 2, 16, and 40 h post-hepatectomy by homogenization in guanidine isothyocyanate and purification by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation (25Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Hsu J-C. Melby A.E. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). All RNA samples were analyzed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer Lab-on-a-Chip Nano 6000 chip to determine the integrity and concentration of the samples. Only samples passing this quality control step with a ratio of the 28-18 S RNA of ≥2.0 were used for expression analysis. Microarray Expression Profiling and Data Analysis—20 μg of total RNA was indirectly labeled using amino-allyl dUTP and an anchored oligo(dT)20 to prime reverse transcription. Flourescent label (Cy™Dye, Amersham Biosciences) was coupled to the cDNA and hybridized to the PancChip version 5.0 13K cDNA microarray (23Kaestner K.H. Lee C.S. Scearce L.M. Brestelli J.E.

For each array hybridization, labeled liver RNA from one of the four time points was hybridized with a common control RNA sample labeled with a different Cy™Dye. The common control RNA comprised equal quantities of a mixture of RNAs taken from both wild type and C/EBPβ-/- mutant mice (28Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Selitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1932-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) prepared from quiescent (0 h), 2, 16, 24, 30 40, and 48 h post-hepatectomy. This diverse pool of RNA ensured good expression coverage and was used to minimize the production of zero denominators in the calculation of expression ratios for the time course analysis. Four biological replicates were used for each of the 0-, 2-, 16-, and 40-h time points. For each array hybridization, a dye-swap hybridization was performed, such that for each time point, two of the biological replicates were hybridized as test (Cy5, red) versus common control (Cy3, green) and the other two biological samples as common control (Cy5) versus test (Cy3). The replicate dye-swap analysis reduced the impact of dye bias or other labeling artifacts on the ratio of gene expression at a given time point. The median intensities of each spot on the array were measured by an Agilent Scanner using the GenePix version 5 software, and the ratio of expression for each element on the array was calculated in terms of M (log2(red/green)) and A ((log2(red) + log2(green))/2)). The data were normalized by the print tip lowess method using the Statistical Microarray Analysis package in the software package R (29Dudoit S. Fridlyand J. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 0036.1-0036.21Crossref Google Scholar). For statistical analysis, the genes were identified as differentially expressed using the Patterns from Gene Expression package (PaGE 1The abbreviations used are: PaGE, Patterns from Gene Expression; QPCR, quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR; EASE, Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer. version 5.0) as described previously (30Manduchi E. Grant G.R. McKenzie S.E. Overton G.C. Surrey S. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two-class, unpaired data tests were also performed to specifically identify genes that were differentially expressed by more than 1.5-fold when comparing the different time points: 0-versus 2-h, 0-versus 16-h, and 0-versus 40-h. In all cases, a false discovery rate of 0.2 was chosen to identify differentially expressed genes. The microarray data are available through the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME)-compliant data base RAD (RNA abundance data base) (31Manduchi E. Grant G.R. He H. Liu J.

Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR (QPCR)—Differential gene expression was confirmed using QPCR. Liver RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed at 42 °C for 1 h with 1 μg of oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase. PCR reaction mixes were assembled using the Brilliant® SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene). 10 μm primers, 1 μl of cDNA, and the included reference dye at a 1:200 dilution were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. The reactions were performed using the SYBR Green (with Dissociation Curve) program on the Mx4000™ Multiplex Quantitative PCR System (Stratagene). Cycling parameters were 95 °C for 10 min and then 40 cycles of 95 °C (30 s), 58 °C or 60 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (30 s) followed by a melting curve analysis. All reactions were performed with four biological replicates and three technical replicates with reference dye normalization. The median cycle threshold value was used for analysis, and all cycle threshold values were normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene TBP (confirmed not to be differentially expressed with microarray expression analysis). Primer sequences are available upon request. The Student's t test was used to confirm that the QPCR was significant and matched the direction of the -fold change predicted by the array. An unpaired t test using the one-tailed probability table with a p value significance cutoff of 0.05 was used for all genes tested. Biological Theme Analysis—The software application Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) was used to discover biologically relevant themes in the lists of genes identified as significantly differentially expressed at 2, 16, and 40 h post-hepatectomy (32Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., D.G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, EASE first maps Entrez Gene identifiers for all genes assayed using the PancChip-to-gene categories represented by the gene ontology function. Within various categorical systems supported by the gene ontology function, the `population total' is determined for each system of gene categorization (e.g. biological process or molecular function), and the `population hits' are determined for every category within those systems (e.g. hormone metabolism or protein biosynthesis). In a second step, the lists of genes differentially expressed at each time point are analyzed to determine which functional categories are over-represented. Third, the probability of obtaining the number of genes in a certain pathway in the list of differentially expressed genes is then compared with the representation of the same pathway among all the genes on the microarray and is calculated as the Fisher exact probability. This probability is then used to calculate the metric known as the `EASE score,' which is a conservative adjustment to the Fisher exact probability that weights significance in favor of themes supported by more genes and therefore yields more robust results. To be able to perform the EASE analysis, the 11,681 of the 13,008 expressed sequence tag clones on the PancChip M5.0 were annotated with Entrez gene identifiers (formerly Locus identifiers) using assembly annotation from the Data Base of Transcribed Sequences (DoTS version 9.0) (55Biology The Computational Laboratory Informatics All Genes. Center for Bioinformatics, University of Pennsylvania2004Google Scholar) and annotation tools available at the Data Base for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (56Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Baseler M.W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining expressed sequence tag clones were excluded from the analysis, as they represented novel transcripts, and these elements on the array could not be annotated with a gene identifier. To prevent false over-representation of a particular gene identifier, all duplicates were removed from the lists giving a population of 7,125 unique gene identifiers and 155, 259, and 479 unique gene identifiers representing genes differentially expressed by >1.5-fold at 2, 16, and 40 h, respectively. The data were analyzed for themes using the gene ontology cellular compartment, molecular function and biological process provided by NCBI (33Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. Harris M.A. Hill D.P. Issel-Tarver L. Kasarskis A. Lewis S. Matese J.C. Richardson J.E. Ringwald M. Rubin G.M. Sherlock G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (27692) Google Scholar). The lists of up- and down-regulated genes at each time point were analyzed with the categorical over-representation function of EASE, and the most significantly over-represented categories were identified using EASE scores. All significant (p < 0.05) categories resulting from each list produced the over-represented biological themes shown in supplemental Table 2S. Pathway Analysis—Biologically relevant networks were drawn from the lists of genes that were differentially expressed at the 2-, 16-, and 40-h time points when compared with the 0-h time point. These data were generated through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, a web-delivered application (www.Ingenuity.com) that enables the visualization and analysis of biologically relevant networks to discover, visualize, and explore therapeutically relevant networks. Expression data sets containing gene identifiers (Entrez gene identifiers) and their corresponding expression values as -fold changes were uploaded as a tab-delimited text file. Each gene identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. The genes identified as differentially expressed by statistical analysis using PaGE described previously and which had a -fold change between any of the time points of >1.5 were included in the analysis. These genes, called `focus genes,' were then used as the starting point for generating biological networks. To start building networks, the application program queries the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base for interactions between focus genes and all other gene objects stored in the knowledge base and generates a set of networks. The program then computes a score for each network according to the fit of the network to the set of focus genes. The score indicates the likelihood of the focus genes in a given network being found together due to random chance. A score of >2 indicates that there is a <1 in 100 chance that the focus genes were assembled randomly into a network due to random chance. Identification of Temporally Regulated Genes during Liver Growth—To identify genes that were differentially expressed at specific phases of the regenerative process, liver RNA samples were obtained from mice 0, 2, 16, and 40 h after partial hepatectomy. These time points correspond to quiescent liver, early G1, mid-G1, and S phase of the hepatocyte cell cycle in this system (Fig. 1A). One significant challenge inherent to high throughput analysis of large scale changes in gene expression is the development of statistical methods that will maximize both the sensitivity and specificity of detection of differentially expressed genes. The PaGE statistical analysis package is a tool for analyzing microarray gene expression data useful for identifying expressed genes between two conditions and for generating patterns across multiple conditions (30Manduchi E. Grant G.R. McKenzie S.E. Overton G.C. Surrey S. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PaGE uses an algorithm that generates discrete patterns using a false discovery rate based on confidence measures. In the present study, we used a false discovery rate of 20% to maximize sensitivity without significantly impacting accuracy. To identify candidate genes involved in early growth as well as later phases of liver regeneration, we also determined which genes were differentially expressed between time points. Two-class, unpaired tests were performed to identify genes that were differentially expressed by >1.5-fold at 2, 16, and 40 h post-hepatectomy compared with quiescent liver. Using these criteria, a total of 641 genes were found to be differentially expressed (Table I and Fig. 1B). A sequential increase in the number of genes differentially expressed was observed with time after partial hepatectomy, with the comparison between 0 and 40h producing the largest change in gene expression. Table II lists the top 10 genes by -fold change, up or down, for each of the comparisons made, whereas the complete list of affected genes is given in Table 1S (supplemental data). The groups of differentially expressed genes are shown schematically in the Venn diagram of Fig. 1B, again highlighting the fact that the largest number of genes were differentially regulated at 40 h post-hepatectomy versus 0 h.Table IITop 10 up- or down-regulated genes identified in each of the comparisons shown in Table 1ATop 10 up-regulated genesTop 10 down-regulated genesEntrez gene identifierGene symbolFold changeEntrez gene identifierGene symbolFold change0 h vs. 2 h comparison16006Igfbp132.614870Gstp1-6.2100620AK03372714.214869Gstp2-5.5229751LOC22975111.915495Hsd3b4-4.317750Mt29.220341Selenbp1-3.114262Fmo38.813107Cyp2f2-2.856031Ppie8.5105171Arrdc3-2.712227Btg27.817836Mug1-2.722072Prss27.3246277Csad-2.611723Amy27.1103781AK033431-2.569060Pnlip7.115492Hsd3b1-2.40 h vs. 16 h comparison16819Lcn2120.712350Car3-21.020209Saa267.315495Hsd3b4-9.011808Apoa423.612401Serpina6-8.119014Pparbp18.114859Gsta3-5.8234199FgI112.518478Pah-5.622151Tubb27.966234Sc4mol-5.016006Igfbp14.711522Adh1-4.511520Adfp4.6110196Fdps-4.316426Itih33.613107Cyp2f2-4.2737102410129E14Rik3.4107869Cth-3.90 h vs. 40 h comparison20209Saa283.412350Car3-15.516819Lcn249.613107Cyp2f2-6.911808Apoa421.3769712810007J24Rik-5.622072Prss214.015495Hsd3b4-4.516592Fabp59.917836Mug1-4.066473Ctrb9.612633Cflar-3.719014Pparbp9.214081Acsl1-3.6234199Fgl18.8231691Sds-3.6IMAGE = 56489678.420341Selenbp1-3.422074Try47.718703Pigr-3.3 Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis Using PaGE Is Highly Predictive of True Differences in Gene Expression—QPCR was used to determine how accurately the PaGE statistical analysis identified differentially expressed genes. 28 genes were chosen randomly from the 0 versus 40 h comparison. Of these 28 genes, 23 (82%) were found to be differentially expressed between 0 and 40 h post-hepatectomy by QPCR (Fig. 2). Thus, PaGE is a highly accurate tool for the analysis of microarray data. The predictive power of the PaGE statistical analysis program was further highlighted by the correspondence between the preset 20% percent false discovery rate and the fact that ∼20% of the genes showed no statistically significant change in gene expression by QPCR. Identification of Global Programs Important for Homeostatic and Proliferative Responses in the Proliferating Liver—Coordinated changes in the expression of networks of genes involved in growth or homeostatic functions are essential for restoration of liver mass and survival during the post-hepatectomy period. The EASE program (see `Materials and Methods') was used to identify important biological themes over-represented among genes that were differentially expressed at 2, 16, and 40 h post-hepatectomy (32Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., D.G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 summarizes some of the most significant themes that were identified using this analysis, whereas a complete list of themes with significant scores is contained within supplemental Table 2S. Genes involved in steroid and lipid metabolism were down-regulated as early as the 2-h post-hepatectomy time point and remained decreased throughout the remainder of the time course examined (Fig. 3A).

Here, we investigated the kinetics of dephosphoryation of phospho-tau by PP5 and found that PP5 had a Km of 8–13 μm toward tau, which is similar to that of PP2A, the major known tau phosphatase. This Km value is within the range of intraneuronal tau concentration in human brain, suggesting that tau could be a physiological substrate of both PP5 and PP2A. PP5 dephosphorylated tau at all 12 Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated abnormal phosphorylation sites studied, with different efficiency toward each site. Thr205, Thr212, and Ser409 of tau were the most favorable sites; Ser199, Ser202, Ser214, Ser396, and Ser404 were less favorable sites; and Ser262 was the poorest site for PP5. Overexpression of PP5 in PC12 cells resulted in dephosphorylation of tau at multiple phosphorylation sites. The activity but not the protein level of PP5 was found to be decreased by ∼20% in AD neocortex. These results suggest that tau is probably a physiological substrate of PP5 and that the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD might result in part from the decreased PP5 activity in the diseased brains.

Tau protein is a major microtubule-associated protein in neurons. The known biological function of tau protein is to stimulate and stabilize microtubule formation from tubulin subunits. In human brain, there are six tau isoforms generated by alternative mRNA splicing from a single gene (1Goedert M. Spillanti M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A.

However, the molecular mechanism by which tau becomes abnormally hyperphosphorylated in AD brain is not yet well understood. Theoretically, the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau could be the result of up-regulation of tau kinases or down-regulation of tau phosphatases. Several studies have shown that three major protein phosphatases (PPs), PP1, PP2A, and PP2B, dephosphorylate tau in vitro (17Yamamoto H. Saitoh Y. Fukunaga K. Nishimura H. Miyamoto E. J.

These studies suggest that in addition to PP2A, other phosphatases or factors might also participate in the regulation of tau phosphorylation. PP5 is a 58-KDa phosphoseryl/phosphothreonyl protein phosphatase. It is ubiquitously expressed in all types of mammalian tissue, with a relatively high level in the brain (34Becker W. Buttini M. Limonta S. Boddeke H. Joost H.G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Bahl R. Bradley K.C. Thompson K.J. Swain R.A. Rossie S. Meisel R.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 90: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PP5 contains a C-terminal catalytic domain structurally related to the PP1/PP2A/PP2B family and an N-terminal regulatory domain consisting of three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that usually mediate protein-protein interaction. It has been demonstrated that PP5 interacts with multiple target proteins through the TPR domain (for review, see Ref. 36Chinkers M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 28-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the absence of activators, PP5 exhibits unusually low phosphatase activity in vitro. However, PP5, after removal of its TPR domain or in the presence of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA ester or long-chain fatty acids, effectively dephosphorylates p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as well as phosphoproteins such as casein, myelin basic protein, reduced carboxamidomethylated and maleylated lysozyme, and tau (37Chen M.X.

Metab. 2001; 12: 28-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), few physiological substrates and functions for PP5 have thus far been defined. We recently found (40Gong C-X. Liu F. Wu G. Rossie S. Wegiel J. Li L. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that PP5 dephosphorylates tau in vitro and may associate with microtubules, raising the possibility that PP5 may also participate in regulation of tau phosphorylation in the brain. To elucidate the role of PP5 in regulation of tau phosphorylation and in the hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD, we studied the kinetics of tau dephosphorylation by PP5, mapped the sites of tau dephosphorylated by PP5, investigated tau dephosphorylation by PP5 in cultured cells, and measured PP5 activity in AD and control brains. Our results suggest that PP5 may play a role in regulation of tau phosphorylation and that a reduction of PP5 activity may contribute to hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD.

Open table in a new tab Brain Tissue—Medial temporal gyrus of six AD brains (one male and five females; age, 86.5 ± 6.5 years; post-mortem delay, 2.6 ± 0.5 h) and seven age-matched normal human brains (two males and five females; age, 86.6 ± 2.9 years; post-mortem delay, 2.9 ± 0.4 h) used for this study were obtained from the Sun Health Research Institute Donation Program (Sun City, AZ). All brain samples were pathologically confirmed and stored at –70 °C until used. Preparation of Phosphorylated Tau (P-tau) and 32P-labeled Tau— Recombinant tau441 was phosphorylated with cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase 5/p25 by incubating tau441 (2 mg/ml) with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (10 μg/ml) in buffer consisting of 40 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 0.2 mm ATP at 30 °C for 90 min. The pH of the reaction mixture was then adjusted to 7.4 with 1 N NaOH, followed by addition of cyclin-dependent kinase 5/p25 (60 μg/ml) and additional 0.2 mm ATP. After incubation at 30 °C for another 4 h, the reaction mixture was desalted by using Sephadex G-50. Fractions containing P-tau were pooled and stored at –20 °C. When used for radioactive phosphatase assays, nonradioactive ATP was substituted with [γ-32P]ATP (750 × 106 μCi/mol) for preparation of 32P-tau. Under these conditions, ∼3 moles of phosphate were added to each mole of tau441. PP5 Activity Assays—Unless specified, PP5 assays were performed in a reaction mixture (15 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μm arachidonyl-CoA (AA-CoA), and 0.1 mg/ml 32P-tau. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated, and the released 32Pi was determined by Cerenkov counting after separation from 32P-tau by ascending paper chromatography as described previously (46Gong C-X. Shaikh S. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Brain Res. 1996; 741: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the kinetic analyses, PP5 was assayed by using increasing concentrations (0.5–40 μm) of 32P-tau, and the Km value of PP5 was calculated by using the Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal method. The catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) was calculated by dividing the turnover number (Kcat, the number of molecules of substrate turned into product by 1 molecule of enzyme in 1 s) by the Km value. Dephosphorylation of P-tau by PP5—P-tau (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated with 0.5 μg/ml PP5 at 30 °C for 2 h in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 μm AA-CoA. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.33 volume of 4-fold concentrated sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. After heating in boiling water for 5 min, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using site-specific and phosphorylation-dependent tau antibodies as described previously (41Liu F. Iqbal K. Grandke-Iqbal I. Gong C-X. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For quantitative detection of site-specific dephosphorylation of tau by PP5, the dephosphorylation reaction was carried out by using the same condition as described above for PP5 activity assay, except that P-tau was used to replace 32P-tau. The reaction was stopped by addition of a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 μm okadaic acid, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA). The dephosphorylation of P-tau at each specific site was measured by using a dot-blot radioimmunoassay as described previously (47Liu F. Zaidi T. Iqbal K. Grandke-Iqbal I. Gong C-X. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of PP5—Rat brain or autopsy human brain tissue was homogenized with 9 volumes of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. The 16,000 × g extracts were prepared, and the protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The diluted extracts were then incubated with anti-PP5 antibody that was pre-bound to protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) for 4 h at 4 °C. The negative control was prepared with protein G-agarose beads without anti-PP5. The immunoprecipitated complex was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline and two times with Tris-HCl buffer and used for Western blots or PP5 activity assay. Transfection of PC12 Cells and PP5—pCI plasmids encoding full-length rat PP5 (pCI-FLAG-PP5499) or C-terminal truncated, lipid-independent active PP5 (pCI-FLAG-PP5486) were constructed as described previously (38Skinner J.

Parker C. Tomer K. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol.

PC12 cells with stable expression of tau441, which were cloned as described previously (40Gong C-X. Liu F. Wu G. Rossie S. Wegiel J. Li L. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), were transiently transfected with either pCI-FLAG-PP5499 or pCI-FLAG-PP5486 by using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were harvested and lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by Western blot analysis as described previously (41Liu F. Iqbal K. Grandke-Iqbal I. Gong C-X. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Tau Dephosphorylation Catalyzed by PP5—PP5 requires free long-chain fatty acids or long-chain fatty acyl-CoA esters for its activity (39Ramsey A.J. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5625-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the activation of PP5 using AA-CoA, the most abundant intracellular long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, by using recombinant tau phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase 5/p25 as a substrate. We found that AA-CoA caused a concentration-dependent stimulation of PP5 activity toward P-tau. Stimulation was seen with a concentration of AA-CoA as low as 0.3 μm and reached a plateau at ∼5 μm AA-CoA (Fig. 1A). At 20 μm AA-CoA, PP5 activity toward P-tau was stimulated by 25-fold. The AA-CoA concentration required for half-maximal activation (AC50) was 1.2 μm (Fig. 1A, inset). When pNPP, a commonly used non-protein substrate for phosphatases, was used as substrate, AA-CoA stimulated PP5 activity with a slightly lower AC50 and maximal stimulation (Fig. 1A). We then measured the Km value of PP5-catalyzed dephosphorylation of P-tau in the presence of 5 μm AA-CoA. We observed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics of dephosphorylation of P-tau by PP5 (Fig. 1B). Plot of the data by the Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal method demonstrated a very good fit (Fig. 1C). The Km calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk equation was 7.6 μm. The calculated catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) was 98 × 103 s–1 m–1. As a reference, we also measured the Km of PP5-catalyzed dephosphorylation of pNPP and found a Km of 64 mm, which is in agreement with those reported by Ramsey and Chinkers (39Ramsey A.J. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5625-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because the intraneuronal tau concentration is estimated to be 5–10 μm (49Khatoon S. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), our results suggest that tau is probably a physiological substrate of PP5. The above-mentioned kinetic studies were carried out by using recombinant rat PP5 expressed from Escherichia coli.To learn whether recombinant PP5 catalyzes dephosphorylation of tau with the same kinetics as brain PP5, we compared the Km of recombinant PP5 with that of PP5 immuno-affinity-purified from rat brain and human brain extracts. Western blot analyses demonstrated that anti-PP5 successfully immunoprecipitated most of PP5 from brain extract but did not co-precipitate PP1, PP2A, or PP2B, the three major protein phosphatases in mammalian brain (Fig. 2A). Binding of our anti-PP5 to PP5 did not block its phosphatase activity, as demonstrated by dose-dependent phosphatase activity of the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the fact that the PP5 antiserum recognizes the linker region between the TPR and catalytic domains rather than catalytic domain of PP5 (35Bahl R. Bradley K.C. Thompson K.J. Swain R.A. Rossie S. Meisel R.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 90: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We then studied the kinetics of brain PP5 toward P-tau and found that the Km values of rat brain PP5 and human brain PP5 were similar to that of recombinant rat PP5 (Fig. 2C and Table II). Therefore, we used recombinant PP5 for the rest of this study. The Vmax of brain PP5 calculated from Fig. 2C was not comparable with that of the recombinant PP5 calculated from Fig. 1C because the exact amount of brain PP5 used for these assays was not known.Table IIKm of PP5 from various sources using phosphorylated tau as a substratePP5KmμmRecombinant PP57.6Rat brain PP512.1Human brain PP513.2 Open table in a new tab PP5 Dephosphorylates P-tau at Multiple Sites—Phosphorylation of different sites within tau differentially impacts the biological activity of tau and the polymerization of tau into PHFs. To map to the exact sites that are dephosphorylated by PP5, we used a number of phosphorylation-dependent tau antibodies that recognize tau phosphorylation at individual sites. As shown in Fig. 3, a combination of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 phosphorylated recombinant tau at Thr181, Ser199, Ser202, Thr205, Thr212, Ser214, Thr231, Ser235, Ser262, Ser396, Ser404, and Ser409. An up-shift of the gel mobility of tau was also seen after phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B, compare lanes 2 with lanes 1). Treatment of P-tau with PP5 abolished the staining of all these phosphorylation-dependent antibodies and changed the gel mobility to the same as that for unphosphorylated tau (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 with lanes 2). These results indicated that PP5 dephosphorylates tau at all the above-mentioned phosphorylation sites studied. We further investigated the efficiency of tau dephosphorylation by PP5 at individual phosphorylation sites. The site-specific dephosphorylation of tau was measured by a dot-blot radioimmunoassay developed with the corresponding site-specific tau antibodies. Comparison of the extent of dephosphorylation at specific sites as a function of PP5 concentration indicated that PP5 dephosphorylated tau most efficiently at Thr205, Thr212, and Ser409; moderately at Ser199, Ser202, Ser214, Ser396, and Ser404; and least efficiently at Ser262 (Fig. 4). Similar results were also obtained when the time courses of the dephosphorylation at various sites were studied (data not shown). Because the signal for Thr181, Thr231, and Ser235 of P-tau was low compared with those of other site-specific antibodies (see Fig. 3), the quantitative dephosphorylation of tau at these sites was not measured. PP5 Dephosphorylates Tau in Living Cells—We also investigated whether PP5 dephosphorylates tau in living cells by using PC12 cells that stably expressed human tau441 (40Gong C-X. Liu F. Wu G. Rossie S. Wegiel J. Li L. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with either full-length rat PP5499 or C-terminal truncated PP5486 that is active in the absence of lipid (50Sinclair C. Borchers C. Parker C. Tomer K. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23666-23672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We found that after transfection for 48 h, the expression of recombinant PP5 was ∼5-fold higher than that of endogenous PP5 as estimated by Western blots developed with anti-PP5 (Fig. 5A). The expression level of active PP5486 was similar to or slightly lower than that of full-length PP5499 as estimated according to the staining intensity with anti-PP5. When several tau antibodies, each of which only recognizes tau phosphorylated at its specific phosphorylation site, were used to study the effect of PP5 overexpression on tau phosphorylation, we found that the transient transfection of either PP5499 or PP5486 in PC12 cells resulted in decreased staining of tau with these phosphorylation-dependent tau antibodies, indicating dephosphorylation of tau at all the phosphorylation sites studied (Fig. 5, B–H). At several phosphorylation sites (Ser199, Ser202, and Ser214), tau was dephosphorylated to a larger extent when transfected with the lipid-independent, active PP5486 than with full-length PP5499. Because these two forms of PP5 were expressed at comparable levels, this result is consistent with the conclusion that PP5486, which is more active than PP5499 in vitro, promotes more extensive dephosphorylation of tau in living cells. The identical amounts of tau loaded into each lane of these blots were confirmed by using phos"
https://openalex.org/W2136921951,"ERK5 is unique among mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in that it contains a large C-terminal tail. We addressed the question of how this tail could affect the signaling capacity of ERK5. Gradual deletion of the C-terminal domains resulted in a drastic increase of ERK5 kinase activity, which was dependent on the up-stream MAPK cascade, thus indicating a possible auto-inhibitory function of the tail. It is interesting that ERK5 was able to autophosphorylate its own tail. Moreover, ERK5, which was found to be expressed in virtually all kinds of cell lines, localized to nuclear as well as cytoplasmic compartments. The localization of ERK5 was determined by its C-terminal domains, which were also required for appropriate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Taken together, these results indicate that ERK5 signaling is directed by the presence of its unique C-terminal tail, which might be the key to understanding the key role of ERK5 in MAPK signaling.

Plowman G.D. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 514-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Although MAPKs often serve as common conduit for a myriad of diverse stimuli, they still lead to highly defined and distinct cellular responses. Recent research has shed some light on this apparently paradoxical situation. The duration and magnitude of MAPK activation on one hand and the localization of MAPKs on the other hand were identified as critical parameters that define specific cellular responses (2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar, 3Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). One of the most explored functions of MAPK signaling is the regulation of gene expression by direct or indirect phosphorylation and subsequent activation of transcription factors (4Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Because many of these transcription factors are located in the nucleus, translocation of MAPKs to the nuclear compartment is essential for exerting transcriptional control (4Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 5Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). MAPKs can be grouped into four main subfamilies: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2, the c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p38 stress-activated protein kinases, and ERK5. The members of the first three subgroups are highly homologous and have overlapping, if not redundant, signaling capabilities. ERK5, however, is the only member of the last and fourth subgroup of MAPKs. The outstanding role of ERK5 within MAPK signaling is best demonstrated by the fact that ERK5-deficient embryos die between days 9.5 and 11.5 because of severe cardiovascular defects (6Sohn S.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9248-9253Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), whereas mice lacking ERK1 develop normally (8Selcher J.C. Nekrasova T. Paylor R. Landreth G.E. Sweatt J.D. Learn Mem. 2001; 8: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 9Pages G. Guerin S. Grall D. Bonino F. Smith A. Anjuere F. Auberger P. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1999; 286: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Using a conditional knock-out, the role of ERK5 could be extended to the maintenance of the cardiovascular system in adult mice (10Hayashi M. Kim S.W. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Yoshida T. Abel E.D. Eliceiri B. Yang Y. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). ERK5 differs considerably from other MAPKs, which are only slightly larger than the minimum kinase core defined by cyclin-dependent kinases (11Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar), in that ERK5 contains an unusually long carboxyl-terminal tail. Because of this unique 400-amino acid extension, ERK5 was also termed big MAP kinase 1. The C-terminal tail of ERK5, containing two proline-rich (PR) domains, shares no higher homology with other mammalian proteins. As early as 1995, after the simultaneous cloning of ERK5 by two different groups (12Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 13Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) speculated that the strikingly large tail of ERK5 might contribute to the regulation of its activity and/or localization. Elucidation of the function of the C terminus was also expected to be a key step toward understanding the particular role of ERK5 among MAPKs in the regulation of cell physiology. Although ERK5 has been shown to be involved in the control of various cellular processes ranging from myoblast differentiation and cancer cell proliferation to survival of neurons (14Dinev D. Jordan B.W. Neufeld B. Lee J.D. Lindemann D. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Kato Y. Chao T.H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Lee J.D. Immunol.

Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), the exact function of its unique C-terminal domains remained largely unknown. The demonstration that the tail of ERK5 could act as transcriptional co-activator further added to the enigmatic character of this big MAPK (17Kasler H.G. Victoria J. Duramad O. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8382-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed the question of whether and how the unique C-terminal domains could influence the signaling capacity of ERK5. Using sequentially truncated mutants of ERK5, we showed that the C-terminal tail regulated its activation, autophosphorylation, localization, and the dynamics of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In agreement with in vitro studies performed by Mody et al. (18Mody N. Campbell D.G. Morrice N. Peggie M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 567-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that ERK5 is able to phosphorylate its own C-terminal tail at several sites. Based on our data and results from Yan et al. (19Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) identifying a cryptic nuclear localization sequence in tail region, we propose a hypothetical model that could explain the behavior of ERK5 mutants and prove helpful when addressing questions of ERK5 function. In this model, we consider ERK5 to exist in a closed or open confirmation, with the latter stabilized by activating phosphorylations and allowing nuclear import. Antibodies and Reagents—For the generation of ERK5 antibodies, rabbits were immunized with a fusion protein of GST and ERK5 amino acids (aa) 410–558. The anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Diagnostics) was used for immunoprecipitation and the HA.11 (BAbCO) for Western blot analysis. Anti-ERK2 K23 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and anti-tubulin antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-Ran-GAP antibody was kindly provided by Frauke Melchior (Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany).

Constructs for truncated variants of ERK5 and the ERK2/ERK5 chimera consisting of aa 410–815 of ERK5 C-terminally fused to full-length ERK2 were generated by standard PCR techniques. The non-activatable form of ERK5 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the activating motif TEY to AEF. Fusion proteins of GST and portions of ERK5 were constructed by subcloning cDNA fragments encoding ERK5 aa 410–558, 558–709, and 710–815 into pGEX5X vectors (Amersham Biosciences). Bacterial expression construct for GST-MEF2C (aa 175–327) was kindly provided by Silvio Gutkind (Bethesda, MD). All GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 DE3 Codon + (Stratagene) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Sequences of used oligonucleotides are available on request. Cell Culture and Transfection—All cells with the exception of PC-12 (P. Cohen, Dundee, Scotland, UK), HaCaT (K. Specht, Martinsried, Germany), MEF (L. Hennighausen, Bethesda, MD) and DAL (G. Natali, Rome, Italy) were obtained from either Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, the European Collection of Cell Cultures, or the American Type Culture Collection and were cultivated following the supplier's instructions. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. COS-7 cells were plated on 6- or 12-well dishes and transfected with 1 or 0.3 μg of DNA, respectively, following Qiagen's Polyfect protocol. Cells were generally processed and analyzed after 48 h. If required, cells were starved by serum withdrawal for 24 h. Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analysis—Cell cultures were washed with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerine, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.5% aprotinin). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical). Supernatants were pre-cleared with 20 μl of Sepharose slurry. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously with slight modifications (21Buschbeck M. Eickhoff J. Sommer M.N. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29503-29509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, lysates were incubated with anti-HA or anti-ERK5 antibodies together with 20 μl of either protein G or A-Sepharose, respectively, for at least 3 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, suspended in 1.2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted. If quantification was necessary, filters were exposed to the LAS1000 chemiluminescence camera (Fujifilm) and analyzed with the program Image Gauge 3.3 (Fujifilm). Kinase Assays—For in vitro ERK5 kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm orthovanadate). Samples were suspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 50 μm ATP, 1.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 3 μg of GST-MEF2C as substrate and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C under constant shaking. For the measurement of ERK2 and ERK2/5 kinase activity, reactions were performed in a different kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm orthovanadate) containing 15 μm ATP, 1.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate for 10 min at room temperature. In general, kinase reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphorylation was detected by filmless autoradiographic analysis using the BAS2500 Reader (Fujifilm) and quantified with Image Gauge 3.3 (Fujifilm). The amount of precipitated kinase was visualized by immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/cm2 on glass coverslips. Transfections were performed as described above, and cells were processed for immunofluorescence after 48 h of further culture. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were washed again and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. After washing thoroughly, samples were incubated in pure fetal calf serum for at least 1 h. After washing twice with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 samples were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-HA or anti-ERK5 antibodies in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and fetal calf serum (1:1) for 1 h. After three more washes with PBS/0.05% Tween 20, cells were incubated with respective secondary Cy2-labeled goat antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h. Samples were washed three more times with PBS/0.05% Tween 20, rinsed in distilled water, and mounted. DNA was stained for 10 min with 1 μg/ml bisbenzimide, H33342, which was included in the penultimate washing step. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—48 h after transfection 1 × 106 COS-7 cells were trypsinated and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g. After washing twice with PBS cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.5% aprotinin) on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were precipitated by centrifugation at 500 × g, and supernatants were kept as cytosolic extracts. Nuclei pellets were loosened by vortexing, washed once with hypotonic lysis buffer, and finally dissolved in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Nuclear extracts were sonified (10 min at 4 °C in a sonification bath) to destroy genomic DNA. Cellular debris were removed from both extracts by centrifugation. After determining protein concentration extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting. Expression Pattern of ERK5—We set out to analyze ERK5 expression in a large array of cell lines. Crude cell lysates and anti-ERK5 immunoprecipitates from various human and non-human cancer and non-cancer cell lines were analyzed by anti-ERK5 immunoblot. Because several lines of investigation pointed toward a role for ERK5 in breast cancer, attributing either survival or proliferative potential to ERK5 (15Kato Y. Chao T.H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Lee J.D. Immunol. Res. 2000; 21: 233-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Esparis-Ogando A. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Montero J.C. Yuste L. Crespo P. Pandiella A. Mol. Cell.

Beckman B.S. Burow M.E. Surgery. 2002; 132: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we included 19 established breast cancer cell lines in our analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, a band migrating at 112 kDa corresponding to ERK5 was readily detected in all 19 breast cancer lines as well as in four ovarian cancer cell lines analyzed. Extending the analysis to a wider variety of cell lines, we found ERK5 to be expressed in virtually all cell lines tested (Fig. 1, B and C) albeit at different levels. The resulting expression profile of ERK5 did not correlate with those of other MAPKs (ERK2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or p38) in cell lines derived from the hematopoietic system (Fig. 1C). The presence of ERK5 in such a wide variety of cell types suggests that ERK5 is most probably ubiquitously expressed and gives no hint of a particular cell type-specific function. C-terminal Deletions Result in Enhanced Kinase Activity— Next, we tested whether sequential truncation of the tail would influence the enzymatic activity of ERK5. Therefore, we transfected expression constructs for hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type ERK5 and several truncated mutants into COS-7 cells (a schematic representation of the mutants used is shown in Fig. 2A). Kinase activity of exogenous ERK5 in untreated cells was analyzed in anti-HA immunocomplex kinase assays using a fusion protein of GST and a portion of the transcription factor MEF2C as substrate. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, deletion of the last 100 amino acids in the 713 mutant of ERK5 resulted in a drastic increase in kinase activity. Deleting the PR2 domain did not further add to the effect on kinase activity, whereas two mutants, ERK5 464 and 409, lacking also the linker region between the two PR domains and the PR1 itself, were even more active. Increased kinase activity of truncated ERK5 was also indicated by enhanced autophosphorylation (Fig. 2, B and D). The strong influence of C-terminal truncations on the activity of ERK5 in untreated cells led us to question whether the observed increase in the activity of ERK5 would be dependent on its specific upstream kinase MEK5. Therefore, we tested whether stimulation of starved cells with epidermal growth factor, fetal calf serum, or sorbitol, three known activators of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway (21Buschbeck M. Eickhoff J. Sommer M.N. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29503-29509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), would be able to enhance the activity of mutant ERK5. As shown in Fig. 3A, the activity of ERK5 713 was indeed potently induced in cells treated with either stimulus, as was the case for wild-type ERK5. Likewise, co-expression of a constitutively active MEK5 S311D, T315D (DD) also led to an increase in activity of wild-type and truncated ERK5. The 713 mutant also retained sensitivity to interference with the activating kinase cascade. As shown in Fig. 3B, activity of ERK5 713 in untreated as well as in epidermal growth factor-stimulated cells was blocked by pre-treating cells with a MEK inhibitor. These results indicate that C-terminal truncations of ERK5 most probably facilitate its activation by the MAPK cascade containing MEK5. AEF mutants of ERK5 lacking the two phosphorylation sites for MEK5 cannot be activated but possess basal activity. 2Buschbeck, M., Hofbauer, S., Di Croce, L., Keri, G., and Ullrich, A. (2004) EMBO Rep., in press. As shown in Fig. 3C, deletion of the last 100 amino acids of such a mutant (AEF-713) resulted in an increase of ERK5 phosphorylation in immunocomplex kinase assays in a MEK-independent manner, thus indicating that the far C terminus might also impair autophosphorylation of non-activated ERK5. ERK5 Autophosphorylates on Its C-terminal Tail—The capacity of ERK5 to auto-phosphorylate has been used in the past to monitor ERK5 activity (21Buschbeck M. Eickhoff J. Sommer M.N. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29503-29509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18682-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the enhanced activity of the 713 mutant was not only reflected by increased phosphorylation of the substrate MEF2C but also by its auto-phosphorylation (Figs. 2, B and C, and 3B). Although further truncated mutants were either similar or even more active than ERK5 713 as indicated by substrate phosphorylation, the degree of autophosphorylation decreased with shortening of the tail. Therefore, we tested whether ERK5 would be able to phosphorylate fusion proteins of different portions of its C-terminal tail and GST. These fusion proteins contained either PR1 domain, PR2, or the C-terminal 100 amino acids (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, immunoprecipitated ERK5 phosphorylated the fusion proteins containing either the PR1 or the far C terminus to an extent similar to that of MEF2C but not the fusion protein of PR2 or GST itself. These results are in accordance with in vitro results from the group of Phil Cohen analyzing autophosphorylation of purified ERK5 in vitro. The tail was found to contain five of six main autophosphorylation sites; three of these sites are located in the fusion protein containing PR1, and the other two are in the far C-terminal domain (18Mody N. Campbell D.G. Morrice N. Peggie M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 567-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these results establish that ERK5 is indeed phosphorylating its own tail, the consequences of these modifications remain elusive. Nuclear Localization of ERK5—Many MAPK substrates, which include several transcription factors, reside in the nucleus. Translocation of MAPKs from the cytosolic to the nuclear compartment is therefore essential for their ability to regulate gene transcription (29Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Whitmarsh A.J. Gene. 2003; 320: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of ERK5 in different cell lines. We have reported previously that in COS-7 cells, ERK5 localizes not only to the cytosol but also to the nuclear compartment (21Buschbeck M. Eickhoff J. Sommer M.N. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29503-29509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, nuclear ERK5 staining was not restricted to COS-7 cells but was also found in five other cell lines tested, albeit to different extents. The cellular distribution of ERK5 varied largely between this different cells and ranged from predominant nuclear localization in COS-7 cells to an overall diffuse pattern in BT474 cells. It is interesting that ERK5 was found to concentrate in one or more discrete spots in nuclei of MBA MB 468 and BT20 breast cancer cells as well as in those of Rat-1 fibroblasts. The C Terminus of ERK5 Is a Determinant of Its Nuclear Localization—Small molecules including most MAPKs can, in principle, enter the nucleus by simple diffusion through the nuclear pore. In contrast, proteins with a molecular mass greater than around 60 kDa are actively transported from one side of the nuclear envelope to the other (30Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 31Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Because the nuclear import and export of the considerably larger ERK5 can thus be expected to occur by the latter mechanism, we sought to determine whether its C-terminal domain is involved in the regulation of its nuclear localization. We analyzed the localization of ERK5 and its C-terminally truncated mutants in transfected COS-7 cells by immunofluorescence. Although overexpressed full-length ERK5 was found to mainly reside in the cytosolic compartment, deletion of the last 100 amino acids in the 713 mutant resulted in predominant nuclear localization (Fig. 6, A and B). Similar to the results obtained in the analysis of kinase activity (Fig. 2, B and C), further truncated 575 mutant was phenotypically identical to 713 and was also pre-dominantly nuclear. In contrast, the two shorter 464 and 409 mutants lacking either most or all of the C-terminal tail were similarly distributed over nuclear and cytosolic compartments in the majority of cells. It is noteworthy that Yan et al. identified a NLS between amino acids 505 and 539 (19Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which is absent in the two shortest mutants. According to the immunofluorescence analysis, wild-type as well as mutant ERK5 were detected in cytosolic extracts by immunoblot analysis. All truncated forms of ERK5 were further readily detected in nuclear extracts. In particular, 713 and 575 were enriched in the nuclear fraction, whereas wild-type ERK5 was hardly detectable at all (Fig. 6C). Having shown before that C-terminal deletions favor the activation of ERK5, we used the truncated, nonactivatable AEF-713 to test whether activation would be required for nuclear translocation. As shown in Fig. 6D, AEF-713 was predominantly cytosolic. Although ERK5 carries its own NLS and would thus be able to enter the nucleus on its own, its translocation is still governed by the activating kinase cascade containing MEK5. We next sought to determine whether the tail is able to influence the localization of another MAPK as well. Therefore, we generated a chimeric protein by fusing the complete tail of ERK5 to full-length ERK2, the closest homologue of ERK5 (Fig. 7A). The wild-type form of ERK2, which is devoid of any domains besides the conserved MAPK domain, was found to reside in the nucleus as well as in the cytosol of cells. Cells expressing the ERK2/5 chimera displayed a marked increase in cells with predominant nuclear staining (Fig. 7, B and C). It is noteworthy that the subcellular distribution of wild-type ERK2 was similar to the pattern of ERK5 409 mutant, which lacks the entire tail. Because translocation of ERK2 depends on its activation (3Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we tested whether ERK2 activity was altered by addition of the tail. In contrast to ERK5, which is strongly inhibited by its own tail, the activity of the chimeric protein ERK2/5 was comparable with wild-type ERK2 (Fig. 7D). Subcellular distribution of proteins monitored in fixed cells can be considered a snapshot of a highly dynamic process of protein exchange between all compartments of the cell. To gain some information on the dynamics of nuclear import and export of ERK5, we used leptomycin A to block the nuclear export machinery (32Yashiroda Y. Yoshida M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and tested how this would affect the localization of ERK5. Cells expressing either wild-type ERK5 or the 409 mutant were treated with the toxin and subsequently analyzed by immunofluorescence. Treatment of cells with leptomycin A strongly induced nuclear accumulation of wild-type ERK5, whereas 409 mutant was only mildly affected (Fig. 8, A and B). Taken together, these results suggest a profound role of the unique C-terminal domains of ERK5 in the regulation of its function by influencing its activation, its localization, and the kinetics of its nuclear shuttling. The C-terminal tail of ERK5 is unique among MAPKs. In this study, we addressed the question of whether this large C-terminal extension could affect the signaling capacity of ERK5. The data presented show that the tail influences not only the activation of ERK5 but also its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and might thus define the very particular role of ERK5 within the complexity of cellular signal transduction. Deletion of the last hundred amino acids of ERK5 (713 mutant) led to a marked increase in its kinase activity as assessed by the in vitro phosphorylation of the specific substrate MEF2C. But how could the C-terminal tail of ERK5 influence its enzymatic activity? We considered two possibilities: C-terminal truncation could either result in an enhanced basal activity of ERK5 or facilitate its activation by its specific up-stream kinase MEK5, resulting in an increase in number of activated ERK5 molecules. Based on two observations, we favor the latter as the most likely underlying mechanism. Shortened mutants of ERK5 were sensitive not only to stimulation of cells with known activators of ERK5 but also to inhibition of its activating kinase MEK5. Others have speculated previously that the tail could inhibit kinase activity (33English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Such an autoinhibition could occur, for instance, if ERK5 adopted a conformation in which the tail masked the conserved MAPK docking motif that mediates the interaction of MAPKs with their activation MEKs (34Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Self-inhibition by an intramolecular mechanism is a common theme in the regulation of kinase activity and has been extensively studied in the case of the tyrosine kinase c-Src (35Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and has more recently been demonstrated for tyrosine kinases c-Abl and Bcr-Abl (36Smith K.M. Yacobi R. Van Etten R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 27-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 37Pluk H. Dorey K. Superti-Furga G. Cell. 2002; 108: 247-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Nucleocytoplasmic transport of signaling molecules is essential for the regulation of eukaryotic cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, differentiation, and circadian clocks (38Carmo-Fonseca M. Cell. 2002; 108: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 39Xu L. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the context of MAPK signaling, relocalization of MAPKs from the cytosol to the nucleus is required for phosphorylating and activating those transcription factors that exclusively reside in nuclear compartments (3Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 29Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Whitmarsh A.J. Gene. 2003; 320: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The analysis of several cell lines indicated that endogenous ERK5 localized to cytoplasmic as well as nuclear compartments. When overexpressed in COS-7 cells, ERK5-specific staining was predominantly cytoplasmic; however, deletion of the last hundred amino acids resulted in its nuclear accumulation. Further subsequent deletion of most or all of the ERK5 tail resulted in a loss of its predominant nuclear localization and in equal redistribution over cytosol and nucleus. Nuclear localization of truncated ERK5 was MEK5-dependent because mutation of the two phosphorylation sites for MEK5 resulted in relocalization of ERK5 to the cytosolic compartment. The distribution of the mutants can be explained by the presence of functional nuclear import and export sequences in the tail region. Yan et al. (19Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have identified a functional NLS between amino acids 505 and 539. Sensitivity of wild-type ERK5 to leptomycin treatment, which is lost in the 409 mutant, further shows that the tail is required for a NES-dependent export mechanism. This result further indicates that wild-type ERK5 is continuously shuttling between nucleus and cytosol. In a simplified model (Fig. 9), we can consider ERK5 to exist in closed and open conformations. Under steady-state conditions and in the absence of any factor, the majority of ERK5 is assumed to adopt the closed conformation. Under this condition, ERK5 activation by MEK5 and phosphorylation is hampered. Masking of the NLS and exposure of an NES (or coexport with an NES-containing protein) results in a dominant cytosolic localization. The open conformation, on the other hand, facilitates activation and is stabilized by activating phosphorylations. The additional exposure of the NLS overrides the weaker NES and leads to nuclear accumulation. Dephosphorylation of ERK5 by phosphatases triggers the return to the initial state. Deletion of the far C terminus (713 mutant) might be sufficient to destabilize the closed conformation, which could explain the observed hyperactivation and nuclear accumulation. In contrast to wild-type ERK5, the ERK2-ERK5 chimera seems to adopt an open rather than closed conformation, because addition of the tail did not affect kinase activity but induced an increase in nuclear accumulation, possibly by providing an additional import mechanism. As expected, activated ERK5 can be found in the nuclei of breast cancer cells (22Esparis-Ogando A. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Montero J.C. Yuste L. Crespo P. Pandiella A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 270-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, Raviv et al. recently pointed out that, unlike ERK2, even non-activated ERK5 could be found in nuclei of rat fibroblasts (40Raviv Z. Kalie E. Seger R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1773-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of ERK2 requires binding of the MEK1/2 containing an NLS (3Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 41Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In contrast, because it possesses its own NLS, ERK5 is self-competent to enter the nucleus. According to our hypothetical model, any factor capable of stabilizing the open conformation of ERK5 could thus trigger nuclear import of non-activated ERK5. It is noteworthy that a first activation-independent role for ERK5 was recently demonstrated. The intrinsic basal activity of ERK5 (but not necessarily its activation by MEK5) was shown to contribute to the survival of leukemia cells.2 ERK5 expression was found in virtually all kind of cells, indicating that ERK5, like other MAPKs, is most likely ubiquitously expressed. Rather than being restricted to a particular function in highly specialized cells, this might further indicate that ERK5 presumably serves in the regulation of diverse cellular functions depending on the cellular context. Indeed, in recent years, ERK5 was implicated in different cellular functions ranging from myoblast differentiation (14Dinev D. Jordan B.W. Neufeld B. Lee J.D. Lindemann D. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to proliferation of breast cancer cells (25Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Whether and to what extent the C-terminal tail of ERK5 contributes to its distinct functions remains to be addressed. The knowledge accumulated thus far about the ERK5 tail now allows the design of mutants that can be used to address very particular aspects of ERK5 function. For instance, using the hyperactivated 713 mutant in combination with its functional or inactivated NLS will permit us to discriminate between cytosolic and nuclear functions of ERK5. Of extraordinary interest is the question of which mutants of ERK5 would be able to rescue the embryonically lethal phenotype of ERK5-deficient mice. We would like to thank Dr. Silvio Gutkind for providing valuable reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1977944537,"We have previously shown that caveolin-1, the principal structural protein component of caveolar membrane domains, inhibits cellular proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest. We demonstrate here for the first time that caveolin-1 is expressed in satellite cells but not in mature muscle fibers. Satellite cells are quiescent myogenic precursors that, after muscle injury, become mitotically active, proliferate, and fuse together or, to existing myofibers, to form new muscle fibers. We show that down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression occurs in satellite cells/myogenic precursor cells (MPCs) during muscle regeneration and that hepatocyte growth factor, which is produced after muscle injury, down-regulates caveolin-1. We also demonstrate that down-regulation of endogenous caveolin-1 expression activates ERK and that activation of the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway is necessary to promote muscle regeneration. Finally, we show that overexpression of caveolin-1 inhibits muscle repair mechanisms both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results propose caveolin-1 as a novel regulator of satellite cell functions and suggest that the following signaling pathway modulates satellite cell activation during muscle repair: injured fibers release HGF --> HGF down-regulates caveolin-1 protein expression --> down-regulation of caveolin-1 activates ERK --> activation of ERK promotes muscle repair by stimulating the proliferation and migration of MPCs toward the wounded area."
https://openalex.org/W2109261059,"In response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2 translocates into the nucleus. To probe the mechanisms regulating the subcellular localization of ERK2, we used live cell imaging to examine the interaction between MEK1 and ERK2. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies show that MEK1 and ERK2 directly interact and demonstrate that this interaction in the cytoplasm is largely responsible for cytoplasmic retention of ERK2. Stimulation with EGF caused loss of FRET as ERK separated from MEK and moved into the nucleus. FRET was recovered as ERK returned to the cytosol, indicating ERK reassociation with MEK in the cytoplasm. The EGF-induced transit of ERK through the nucleus was complete within 20 min, and there was no significant movement of MEK into the nucleus. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments was used to assess the rate of movement of MEK and ERK. The steady-state rate of ERK entry into the nucleus in resting cells was energy-independent and greater than the rate of ERK entry upon EGF stimulation. This suggests that the rate constant for ERK transport across the nuclear membrane is not limiting nuclear entry. Thus, we suggest that the movement of ERK into and out of the nucleus in response to agonist occurs primarily by diffusion and is controlled by interactions with binding partners in the cytosol and nucleus. No evidence of ERK dimerization was detected by FRET methods; the kinetics for nucleocytoplasmic transport were unaffected by mutations in the ERK putative dimerization domain. In response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2 translocates into the nucleus. To probe the mechanisms regulating the subcellular localization of ERK2, we used live cell imaging to examine the interaction between MEK1 and ERK2. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies show that MEK1 and ERK2 directly interact and demonstrate that this interaction in the cytoplasm is largely responsible for cytoplasmic retention of ERK2. Stimulation with EGF caused loss of FRET as ERK separated from MEK and moved into the nucleus. FRET was recovered as ERK returned to the cytosol, indicating ERK reassociation with MEK in the cytoplasm. The EGF-induced transit of ERK through the nucleus was complete within 20 min, and there was no significant movement of MEK into the nucleus. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments was used to assess the rate of movement of MEK and ERK. The steady-state rate of ERK entry into the nucleus in resting cells was energy-independent and greater than the rate of ERK entry upon EGF stimulation. This suggests that the rate constant for ERK transport across the nuclear membrane is not limiting nuclear entry. Thus, we suggest that the movement of ERK into and out of the nucleus in response to agonist occurs primarily by diffusion and is controlled by interactions with binding partners in the cytosol and nucleus. No evidence of ERK dimerization was detected by FRET methods; the kinetics for nucleocytoplasmic transport were unaffected by mutations in the ERK putative dimerization domain.

Furthermore, the distribution of ERK2 between cytoplasm and nucleus and the duration of ERK2 residence in the nucleus are critical determinants of the signal mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (3Cyert M.S.

Whereas ERK2 is activated in the cytoplasm, it moves to the nucleus after it is phosphorylated by a mechanism, which has been reported to include at least two pathways (7Adachi M. Fukuda M.

Both passive movement of a monomeric form and active transport of a dimeric form have been invoked to explain this nuclear influx (10Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M.

Disruption of the MEK/ERK interaction causes ERK to accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting that the MEK/ERK interaction maintains ERK in the cytoplasm (11Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Although some fraction of endogenous MEK and ERK must interact directly in vivo to allow for ERK activation, the affinity appears too low to be accurately determined by methods using recombinant proteins in vitro. 2S. Bruck and A. Shaw, unpublished results. 2S. Bruck and A. Shaw, unpublished results. A direct interaction is only inferred from the requirement to co-express MEK with ERK to localize ERK to the cytoplasm; overexpression of ERK alone results in nuclear localization of ERK (4Pouyssegur J. Lenormand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3291-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Several models for how ERK2 nucleocytoplasmic distribution is regulated have been proposed (3Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20805-20808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4Pouyssegur J. Lenormand P. Eur. J.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 4416-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Differences among these models concern the energy dependence of the translocation and the potential role of MEK as an export shuttle factor or as a cytoplasmic “anchor.” ERK2 interacts directly with the nuclear pore complex in the absence of importins and can be imported into the nucleus in the absence of ATP in permeabilized cell systems (8Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Matsubayashi Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41755-41760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Other data have suggested that there is a specific role for active transport of a dimeric active form of ERK (7Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear if dimerization is required for the rapid, agonist-induced entry of ERK into the nucleus. The exit of ERK from the nucleus has been less studied, but some experiments suggest that MEK may function as a nuclear export shuttle factor for ERK (11Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Additionally, MEK and PEA-15 have been proposed to alter ERK localization simply by blocking regions of ERK required for interaction with the nuclear pore (5Xu L. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16Whitehurst A.W. Robinson F.L. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12840-12847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that the steady state distribution of ERK between cytoplasm and nucleus is determined by the regulated expression of compartment-specific binding partners (17Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Here we test these possibilities by using in vivo FRAP and FRET techniques to monitor the interactions and movements of ERK and MEK. Expression Vectors—Nondimerizing A206K variants of GFP, CFP, and YFP were made by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in the Clontech C1 vector (18Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). All fluorescent fusion proteins were made as fusions to the C terminus of GFP (or variants). Mouse ERK2 was cloned into the XhoI/BamHI sites of the MCS; coding sequence of ERK2 starts at alanine 2. The dimer-deficient form of ERK2 (dmERK) was the H176E L4A mutant (10Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Mouse MEK1 was cloned into the HindIII/BamHI sites of the MCS; coding sequence of MEK1 starts at proline 2. Full-length MEK1 was expressed using pCDNA3.1. CFP and YFP fusions with MEK1 lacking the nuclear export sequence (deletion 32–44) were gifts from R. Lewis (University of Nebraska). Membrane-targeted CFP-MEK1 consists of the first 11 residues of murine Lck (MGCVCSSNPED) followed by a 5-amino acid linker (EPVAT) and then methionine 1 of CFP. Cell Culture—All experiments were performed in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells. For microscopy, 105 cells were plated on acid-washed 2.5-cm coverslips on day 1, transfected with 2–4 μg of DNA on day 2 (Superfect; Qiagen), and used at 16–24 h. For imaging, cells were transferred to HEPES-buffered saline with 1% human serum albumin. For ATP depletion, the medium was supplemented with 10 mm sodium azide and 2 mm 2-deoxyglucose. EGF was applied by replacing the buffer with prewarmed buffer including 20 ng/ml EGF. All live cell imaging was performed at 37 °C using a directly heated coverslip system (Bioptechs, Scranton, PA). Image analysis was performed using IPlab (Scanalytics). Scanning confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM 510, and epifluorescence was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 both with a 63 × 1.4 NA objective. For imaging FRET by epifluorescence, we used a photometrics PXL camera, a 150-watt xenon arc lamp, automated filter wheels (providing specific filters for CFP and YFP excitation and emission), and a single multiband dichroic similar to Chroma set 86002v2 (Rockingham, VT). There was minimal cross-talk of CFP to the YFP channel. Three images were acquired sequentially (EX CFP/EM CFP; EX CFP/EM YFP; EX YFP/EM YFP). The normalized FRET was calculated from these images; FRET images are shown as an “intensity-modulated display,” where the grayscale corresponds to the concentration of acceptor and the color scale corresponds to the normalized FRET (19Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). For quantification of FRET by “donor enhancement with acceptor bleaching,” YFP was bleached with a 514-nm line of a krypton/argon laser for both confocal and epifluorescence studies. Similar results were obtained on both instruments. CFP was excitation at 458 for confocal images and with a 435 ± 15-nm filter for epifluorescence. For FRAP studies of movement within the cytoplasm or nucleus, YFP was bleached with both the 488-nm and 514-nm lines simultaneously at full power applied to a 1 × 1-μm square defined to contain 4 × 4 pixels. This region was bleached for <3 s, and then the same region was imaged at less than 1% of the bleach power. The image acquisition rate approaches 1 kHz. Approximate diffusion constants were calculated as if the system were two dimensional and the bleach region were circular. These calculated diffusion constants were within the range considered typical of cytoplasmic proteins (1–3 × 108 cm2/s). The FRAP studies of movement across the nuclear membrane were performed on both the scanning confocal and epifluorescence microscopes and gave similar results. On the scanning confocal, the nucleus was outlined and bleached in a manner similar to that described above except that the region bleached was much larger and generally required ∼30 s of repeated scanning to get at least a 50% reduction in nuclear intensity. Images of the entire cell taken immediately following the bleach showed that the nucleus had a homogenous intensity; the nuclear membrane was clearly defined as the abrupt boundary between the relatively dim nucleus and the relatively bright cytoplasm. To prove that the recovery of fluorescence corresponds to movement across the nuclear membrane rather than movement between image planes within the nucleus, we performed controls in which less than one-fourth of the nucleus is bleached for 30 s; images of the entire cell taken immediately following the bleach showed that the nucleus had a homogenous intensity; again the nuclear membrane was clearly defined as the abrupt boundary between the relatively dim nucleus and the relatively bright cytoplasm. This control confirms that the fluorescent proteins move within a single compartment much faster than they cross the nuclear membrane; this result considerably simplifies the analysis. In the FRAP studies of movement across the nuclear membrane performed by epifluorescence, the entire nucleus was bleached with a short (<3-s) exposure to the 514 line of a 2-milliwatt krypton/argon laser. The beam shape was roughly Gaussian with a full width at half-height corresponding approximately to the width of the nucleus. Again, control experiments showed that movement within the nucleus and cytoplasm was rapid compared with movement across the membrane. Therefore, FRAP measurements could be obtained regardless of exactly where in the cell the beam was focused, provided that bleaching intensity was greater in the nucleus than the cytoplasm. Targeting of MEK to the Plasma Membrane Directs ERK to the Plasma Membrane—The requirement for MEK overexpression to maintain overexpressed ERK in the cytoplasm is well described and reproduced in Fig. 1, A and B. In the absence of MEK overexpression, ERK localizes primarily to the nucleus (Fig. 1A). Co-expression with MEK results in ERK localization in the cytoplasm. To determine whether the localization of ERK is controlled directly by MEK, a mutated form of MEK was generated that targets MEK to the plasma membrane. The membrane-targeted form of MEK was made by fusing sequences encoding the myristoylation and palmitoylation sequences of the Src family tyrosine kinase, LCK, to the N terminus of YFP or CFP, which was in turn fused to the amino terminus of MEK-1. When expressed in HEK 293 cells, this protein was localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). Coexpressed YFP-ERK2 was also strongly localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1D).Fig. 1Membrane-targeted MEK1 recruits YFP-ERK2 to the plasma membrane. HEK 293 cells were transfected with vectors encoding YFP-ERK (A; YFP image), YFP-ERK and MEK (B; YFP image), or simultaneously with LCK-CFP-MEK (C; CFP-image) and YFP-ERK (D; YFP image). Confocal images were acquired from live cells at ∼16 h after transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ERK and MEK Directly Interact in the Cytoplasm—A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay was used to determine whether MEK and ERK might directly associate. FRET requires the two fluorophores to be in close proximity, within ∼4 nm of one another. YFP-ERK was co-expressed with CFP-MEK, and FRET was quantified by measuring the enhancement of donor (CFP) fluorescence upon photobleaching of the acceptor (YFP). FRET was detectable with wild type MEK (Fig. 2, column 1) and a mutated form of MEK lacking the nuclear export sequence, ΔNES-MEK (Fig. 2, column 3). Whereas the fluorescence intensity of ERK in the nucleus and cytoplasm varied with the localization of MEK (>80% cytoplasmic for wild type and >80% nuclear for ΔNES-MEK), the FRET was not significantly different in these two compartments (data not shown). A direct interaction at the plasma membrane of YFP-ERK with the Lck-CFP-MEK was also easily detectable (Fig. 2, columns 4 and 5). Importantly, no significant FRET signal was detected when the unfused fluorescent proteins were overexpressed together or when YFP was overexpressed with CFP-ERK (and vice versa) (Fig. 2, columns 2 and 5). Since ERK moves from cytoplasm to nucleus in response to agonist, FRET measurements were used to assess the temporal relationship between dissociation of MEK and ERK and the movement of ERK into the nucleus. After application of EGF, there was a short lag period followed by an abrupt movement of ERK into the nucleus and a corresponding loss of FRET. The central panel in Fig. 3 shows a field of HEK 293 cells treated with EGF in which the majority of cells show nuclear accumulation of ERK. There was no significant movement of MEK into the nucleus in response to agonist (Fig. 3, top panels). Therefore, the loss of FRET signal suggests that MEK·ERK complexes dissociate before ERK enters the nucleus and that ERK is not associated with MEK in the nucleus. By 600 s after application of EGF, ERK returned to the cytoplasm, and its localization in the cytoplasm was accompanied by increased FRET. The time course of fluorescence and FRET is shown for a representative single cell in Fig. 4. The duration of the nuclear flux was similar to that described in a prior live cell imaging study of GFP-ERK fluxes in PC12 and NIH3T3 cells (20Horgan A.M. Stork P.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 285: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Association of YFP-ERK with MEK in the Cytoplasm Does Not Decrease the Mobility of YFP-ERK—The mobility of MEK and MEK·ERK complexes within the cytoplasm were studied by FRAP techniques. A small region of the cell (∼1 μm2) was bleached, and the recovery was measured in the millisecond time domain. The mobilities of YFP-MEK and YFP-ERK were indistinguishable from the mobility of YFP (Fig. 5A). Therefore, overexpressed YFP-MEK and YFP-ERK appears to diffuse freely in the cytoplasm. When YFP-ERK was overexpressed in the presence of MEK, such that YFP-ERK was retained in the cytoplasm, the mobility of YFP-ERK was again indistinguishable from that of YFP or of YFP-MEK alone. As a control, FRAP studies of the membrane-tethered form of MEK indicated a slow recovery consistent with a membrane-associated molecule that must diffuse within a relatively more viscous medium (single curve shifted to the right in Fig. 5, A and B). YFP-ERK mobility within the nucleus was also indistinguishable from that of YFP alone. These results suggest that MEK and ERK are freely mobile in the cell and are not associated with static cellular structures. In the Absence of MEK, the Accumulation of YFP-ERK in the Nucleus Is Energy-independent—When GFP alone was overexpressed in HEK 293 cells, quantitative confocal imaging indicated that the concentrations of GFP in the nucleus and cytoplasm were approximately equal (data not shown). (The apparent excess of GFP in the nucleus seen in wide field images is probably due to the greater thickness of cells in the region of the nucleus.) In contrast, overexpressed YFP-ERK preferentially accumulated in the nucleus to about 1.5–2 times the concentration in the cytoplasm. Treatment with azide and 2-deoxyglucose to deplete ATP did not affect the localization of YFP-ERK in the nucleus (Fig. 6, bottom). The ATP independence indicates that energy is not required for nuclear localization of YFP-ERK or that both import and export rates are proportionally affected by the ATP depletion. The Rates of YFP-ERK Movement into and out of the Nucleus Are Similar to the Rates for YFP and Are Unaffected by ATP Depletion—FRAP measurements were used to measure the rates of transport of YFP-ERK into the nucleus before and after ATP depletion. In these experiments, since the entire nucleus was bleached, recovery represents the movement of cytoplasmic YFP-ERK across the nuclear membrane. The rates of recovery of nuclear fluorescence for YFP and YFP-ERK were indistinguishable (Fig. 7A). This suggests that the nuclear import of ERK is not mediated by a specific import mechanism and may be energy-independent. These data are also consistent with previous work using permeabilized cells suggesting that ERK import into the nucleus occurs by facilitated diffusion. To test whether ERK movement across the membrane is energy-independent, we performed nuclear FRAP on individual cells before and depletion of ATP. Whereas ATP depletion did not alter the steady state distribution of YFP-ERK between nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 6, graph), the rate of transport was also unaffected by ATP depletion (Fig. 7B). Since the steady-state distribution and the nuclear entry rates were unaffected by ATP depletion, we infer that the nuclear export rate of ERK was also unaffected by ATP depletion. Traversing the Nuclear Membrane Is Not the Rate-limiting Step for Agonist-induced Nuclear Accumulation of YFP-ERK— The bulk rates of YFP-ERK entry into the nucleus for cells either at steady-state (resting) or equilibrium (the rate observed after energy depletion) were much greater than that induced by EGF. For cells with both overexpressed MEK and YFP-ERK, the maximum rate of YFP-ERK entry into the nucleus after the addition of EGF was determined by the maximum change in nuclear fluorescence intensity between any two time-consecutive time points, which occurred about 120 s after the addition of EGF. (To qualitatively compare this maximum rate to the rates seen for steady-state, non-agonist-induced flux of ERK into the nucleus, cells expressing YFP-ERK only were selected, which had a cytoplasmic intensity less than half of that seen in matched cells co-expressing MEK and YFP-ERK. This selection is necessary to assure that a more rapid kinetics of nuclear entry is not simply the trivial result of a larger pool of available YFP-ERK. Cells with this relatively low cytoplasmic concentration of YFP-ERK were easily found, because overexpressed YFP-ERK accumulated in the nucleus, not the cytoplasm, as shown in Fig. 1, A and B). For the steady state or equilibrium state (after ATP depletion), the maximum bulk rate of YFP-ERK movement into the nucleus was determined by photobleaching the nucleus and measuring the recovery at short time intervals. Invariably, this rate of increase of total nuclear fluorescence determined by FRAP of steady-state (or equilibrium) cells overexpressing YFP-ERK was severalfold higher than the maximum rates we ever recorded for YFP-ERK accumulation in the nucleus in response to agonist in cells overexpressing both MEK and YFP-ERK. ERK Dimerization Is Not Required for the Rapid Influx of ERK into the Nucleus in Response to Agonist—It has been suggested that ERK dimerization is required for energy-dependent entry into the nucleus. We were therefore interested to test whether mutated forms of ERK unable to dimerize were impaired in their ability to transport to the nucleus in response to agonist. A mutated form of YFP-ERK (dmERK) with mutations in the putative dimer interface of ERK, expressed in the absence of MEK, distributed to the nucleus in a manner indistinguishable from that for YFP-ERK. The rate of diffusion within the cytoplasm (as measured by cytoplasmic FRAP of 1 μm2) and the movement across the plasma membrane (as measured by nuclear FRAP) were both unchanged. When overexpressed with MEK in HEK 293 cells, YFP-dmERK was retained in the cytoplasm in a manner indistinguishable from that for YFP-ERK, nor was any defect in the rate of ERK movement into the nucleus in response to EGF seen. Because these studies required comparisons between cells and therefore might miss subtle effects of ERK dimerization on the rates of ERK translocation into the nucleus, we measured the movement of both wild type ERK and dmERK co-expressed in the same cells. Again, we found no difference in the rate of CFP-wild type ERK and YFP-dmERK translocation into the nucleus in response to EGF (Fig. 8). There was no reproducible or significant difference in the lag time to entry, the fraction of the two forms that entered the nucleus, or the duration of nuclear localization. This suggests that dimerization of ERK is not required for nuclear entry or exit. Here we demonstrated that ERK and MEK directly interact and that this interaction is largely responsible for cytoplasmic localization of overexpressed ERK in resting cells. Measuring the lateral mobility of ERK bound or unbound to MEK showed high mobility, suggesting that MEK does not restrict ERK to any specific region of the cytoplasm, nor does it “anchor” ERK to a cytoplasmic structure. We also found that the rate of ERK translocation into the nucleus was similar to the rate of translocation of GFP, consistent with data suggesting that ERK is not actively transported into the nucleus. Confirming this, energy depletion did not change the steady state distribution of ERK, nor did it affect the rate of nuclear translocation. These findings suggest that a simple model in which MEK functions as a buffer can explain the localization and nuclear translocation of ERK during signal transduction. This simple model assumes that association with MEK (and other ERK ligands) reduces the concentration of “free” ERK, and only “free” ERK (but not the MEK-ERK complex) can cross the nuclear membrane. Translocation would be initiated by release of ERK from MEK (increasing free ERK in the cytoplasm), followed by facilitated or simple diffusion of ERK into the nucleus, and then binding of ERK to targets in the nucleus. Nuclear versus cytoplasmic distribution could be controlled by the number and affinity of binding partners in each compartment. The accumulation of overexpressed GFP-ERK in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm suggests that there is a relative abundance of ERK binding targets in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm. We hypothesize that the phosphorylation state of MEK and ERK controls the affinity of the complex in the cytoplasm. Whereas the major binding partner of ERK in the nucleus is not known, it has been proposed that dimeric active ERK can bind an abundant class of dimeric transcription factors (10Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In our model, movement of ERK back into the cytoplasm can be explained by dephosphorylation of ERK and reacquisition of affinity for MEK. It is also possible that ERK dephosphorylation regulates its affinity for targets in the nucleus. The presence of a canonical NES in MEK has suggested that MEK might serve as an export shuttle for ERK (11Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This suggestion is partially based on experiments using Leptomycin B treatment, which causes nuclear accumulation of both MEK and ERK (14Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Yao Z. Flash I. Raviv Z. Yung Y. Asscher Y. Pleban S. Seger R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7588-7596Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For several reasons, we do not think that it is likely that MEK serves as an export shuttle for ERK. First, we did not detect significant amounts of GFP-MEK in the nucleus in resting cells, nor did we see an increase in nuclear MEK in agonist-stimulated cells. We also did not detect FRET between MEK and ERK in the nucleus. Second, plasma membrane-targeted MEK, which presumably cannot rapidly traffic through the nucleus, was sufficient to localize ERK in the cytoplasm. Third, since NES-dependent export requires energy, we might have expected MEK to accumulate in the nucleus after energy depletion, but there was no change in GFP-MEK localization after energy depletion. MEK has been previously shown to accumulate in the nucleus with progression from G2 to M phase (22Tolwinski N.S. Shapiro P.S. Goueli S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6168-6174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the MEK NES may have functions that are independent of its association with ERK. The FRAP data suggest that MEK does not function to “anchor” ERK to a specific immobile structure in the cell. It is possible that MEK could link ERK to scaffolds like KSR (kinase supressor of Ras) in the cytoplasm and that overexpressed MEK has saturated binding to scaffolds. Alternatively, it is possible that the scaffolds are freely mobile. Regardless, the interaction of ERK with freely mobile MEK in the cytoplasm is sufficient to account for the cytoplasmic localization of ERK. Although we found no evidence of FRET between molecules of ERK, the crystal structure of the doubly phosphorylated active form of ERK, but not the dephosphorylated form, suggests that active ERK forms dimers (10Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 13Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that ERK dimers interact with dimeric transcription factors, causing retention of active ERK in the nucleus (10Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Others have suggested that activated ERK forms dimers in the cytoplasm, and it is the dimeric ERK that is then actively transported into the nucleus (7Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In our studies, we failed to detect FRET between YFP- and CFP-tagged ERK upon activation with EGF or when coexpressed with a constitutively active form of MEK (data not shown). Similar kinetics of EGF-induced nuclear entry for both wild type and a dimer interface mutant suggest that dimerization is not necessary for nuclear import. We cannot rule out, however, the possibility that dimeric ERK is required for interaction with substrates in the nucleus. Our model suggests that the bulk rate of ERK entry into the nucleus increases only because the amount of free ERK increases upon agonist-induced dissociation from MEK or other ligands. Whereas enhancing the rate constant for facilitated diffusion (or an increased number of pores) could produce the kinds of data seen in our experiments, it is not necessary to invoke this additional mechanism. Because the rate of ERK entry into the nucleus in resting cells was severalfold higher than the rate of ERK entry in response to agonist, the rate constant for nuclear import was not limiting ERK entry into the nucleus. Therefore, the release of ERK from the ERK/MEK complex is probably rate-limiting for ERK translocation. The relatively complex movement of ERK into and out of the nucleus in response to an agonist can be substantially explained by this simple model, which assumes that the affinity of ERK for MEK changes with the phosphorylation state of one or both enzymes. The model assumes the existence of an abundant nuclear binding site for ERK. Furthermore, the model leaves open a role for modulation of the affinity of these nuclear binding sites by changes in phosphorylation of ERK or the binding sites themselves. Ongoing experiments address the role of kinase activity and phosphorylation state in the context of this model.

It has two tandemly repeated carbohydrate recognition domains and specifically binds to an SO3−→3Galβ1→3GalNAc pyranoside with high affinity (Ideo, H., Seko, A., Ohkura, T., Matta, K. L., and Yamashita, K. (2002) Glycobiology 12, 199–208). In this study, we found that galectin-4 binds to glycosphingolipids carrying 3-O-sulfated Gal residues, such as SB1a, SM3, SM4s, SB2, SM2a, and GM1, but not to glycosphingolipids with 3-O-sialylated Gal, such as sLc4Cer, snLc4Cer, GM3, GM2, and GM4, using both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a surface plasmon resonance assay. A confocal immunocytochemical assay showed that galectin-4 was colocalized with SB1a, GM1, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the patches on the cell surface of human colon adenocarcinoma CCK-81 and LS174T cells. This localization was distinct from caveolin/VIP21 localization. Furthermore, immobilized galectin-4 promoted adhesion of CCK-81 cells through the sulfated glycosphingolipid, SB1a. CEA also bound to galectin-4 with KD value of 2 × 10-8 m by surface plasmon resonance and coimmunoprecipitated with galectin-4 in LS174T cell lysates. These findings suggest that SB1a and CEA in the patches on the cell surface of human colon adenocarcinoma cells could be biologically important ligands for galectin-4. Galectin-4, a member of the galectin family, is expressed in the epithelium of the alimentary tract.

Galectins are a family of animal lectins defined by their affinity for β-galactoside-containing saccharides and by common amino acid sequence elements. They are involved in regulating diverse biological phenomena, including proliferation, apoptosis, and cell-cell, or cell-matrix interactions (1Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J.

It has been reported that galectin-4 is present in certain fractions of rafts in the brush border membrane of pig intestine (6Hansen G.H. Immerdal L. Thorsen E. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Nystrom B.T.

However, it is not clear how the soluble galectin-4 could be a component of rafts and with which molecules galectin-4 would interact. We previously reported that galectin-4 binds to SO3−→3Galβ1→3GalNAc pyranoside with high affinity (8Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and this structure occurs not only in O-linked oligosaccharides but also in certain glycosphingolipids (9Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In further investigations of endogenous ligands of galectin-4, we were interested in determining whether glycosphingolipids carrying the 3-O-sulfated galactose residues bind to galectin-4, because galectin-8, which also has two conserved CRDs and is 34% identical to galectin-4 at amino acid levels, binds to glycosphingolipids carrying SO3−→3/sialylα2→3Gal residues (10Ideo H.

These reports suggested that glycosphingolipids could also be biologically important ligands for some members of the galectin family. We also examined whether galectin-4 binds to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and both molecules are colocalized in the cell surface of human colon adenocarcinoma, because CEA is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein (13Gouin E. Ouary M. Pogu S. Sai P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which carries 25–27 mol of N-glycans per molecules (14Fukushima K. Ohkura T. Kanai M. Kuroki M. Matsuoka Y. Kobata A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and is produced by gastrointestinal tumor cells. We show in this study that galectin-4 binds to glycosphingolipids carrying SO3−→3Gal residues and CEA, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. Furthermore, galectin-4 on the cell surface of human colon adenocarcinoma CCK-81 and LS174T cells is colocalized in the patches with SB1a, GM1, and CEA, and this localization differed from caveolin/VIP21 staining on the cell surface, as determined by a confocal immunocytochemical assay.

Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as a template for PCR performed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 0.5 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The primers were 5′-atcgaattcATGGCCTATGTCCCCGCA-3′ and 5′-atcgcggccGCGTAAGGTGGCATCATCGG-3′ for the GST-N-domain, and 5′-atcgaattcATGCCACCTTACCCTGGT-3′ and 5′-atcgcggccGCTCTGGACATAGGACAA-3′ for the GST-C-domain. The PCR products were inserted into the pGEX-6P-1 plasmid between the EcoRI and the NotI sites. Plasmids were transformed into the E. coli BL21 strain. The nucleic acid sequences were confirmed using ABI PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Biosystems). GST-N-domain and GST-C-domain were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Antibody—Antiserum against human galectin-4 was raised in rabbit according to standard procedures. Purified rhgalectin-4 (8Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (1–1.5 mg) was injected into a rabbit (initial and two boosts) at intervals of 3 weeks. Preparation of Sulfoglycosphingolipids—Crude lipids of homogenized CCK-81 cells (5 × 107 cells) were extracted once with 19 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and then with 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8, v/v). The pooled extracts (the total lipid extracts) were dried and dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The solution was spotted on a high-performance thin layer chromatography plate (10 × 10 cm, Kieselgel 60, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and developed using chloroform/methanol/0.2% CaCl2 (60:35:7) as the solvent. Lipids were detected by using primuline (5 mg in 100 ml of acetone/water (80/20, v/v)) and visualized with LAS1000 (Fujifilm, Japan). Sulfated glycosphingolipids were detected by Azure A (15Iida N.

Estimation of Kinetic Constants Based on SPR—The dissociation constants between each of the CRDs of galectin-4 and various carbohydrates were measured using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (8Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ELISA for Binding of Galectin-4 to Various Glycosphingolipids— ELISAs for binding of galectin-4 to various glycosphingolipids using recombinant galectin-4 and anti-galectin-4 were performed in the same manner as described previously (10Ideo H. Seko A. Ishizuka I. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Binding of Galectin-4 to Glycosphingolipids Immobilized on the Surface of BIAcore Sensor Chip—Glycosphingolipids were hydrophobically immobilized onto the CM5 sensor chip according to Catimel et al. (17Catimel B. Scott A.M. Lee F.T. Hanai N. Ritter G. Welt S. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Glycosphingolipids (1 mg/ml) were dissolved in EtOH/MeOH (9:1, v/v), diluted with HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 3.4 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl), and injected (80 μl) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min over the unmodified surface. Purified rhgalectin-4 in HBS buffer was introduced onto the surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The interaction between rhgalectin-4 and glycosphingolipids was monitored at 25 °C, and the kinetic constants were calculated using BIAevaluation 3.0 software. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Human colon adenocarcinoma CCK-81 and LS174T cells grown on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, followed by washing and incubation with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. For double labeling, cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-galectin-4 (rabbit IgG) and anti-SB1a (mouse IgM), anti-GM1 (mouse IgM), anti-CEA (mouse IgG), or anti-caveolin-1/VIP21 (mouse IgG) antibodies in 1% BSA. Cells were then rinsed several times and incubated for 1 h with TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgM or IgG in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. After extensive washing, the coverslips were mounted on slides. Fluorescent images were obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 5 PASCAL, Carl Zeiss, Germany). Images were acquired using the multitrack mode to avoid signal cross-talk. The specificity of labeling was assessed by incubation with control primary antibodies. Cell Adhesion Assay—ELISA plates were pre-coated with rhgalectin-4 in PBS for 16 h at 4 °C, followed by blocking with 1% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. CCK-81 cells and Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells on tissue culture plates were detached with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in PBS. After washing with culture medium, cells were resuspended in serum-free medium containing 10 mm EDTA and re-seeded onto the galectin-4-coated plates. After incubating at 37 °C for 30 min, the plates were washed three times with PBS, and the adherent cells were stained with 0.2% crystal violet in PBS containing 20% methanol for 15 min at 22 °C. Excess dye was washed with water, and the bound cells were solubilized in 1% SDS for 1 h at 22 °C and quantified by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm with a spectrophotometer. All assays were performed in triplicate. Binding of CEA to Galectin-4 Immobilized on the Surface of BIAcore Sensor Chip—The affinity of CEA to galectin-4 was measured by SPR assay using BIAcore 2000 instrument. Galectin-4 was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by the amine-coupling method. The coupling density was 7200 RU. Various concentrations of CEA were diluted in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3.4 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P-20) and injected onto the sensor chip at 20 μl/min. The sensor surface was regenerated by 0.1 m lactose. Immunoprecipitation—1 × 107 of LS174T cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1/100 (v/v) Halt protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce)) for 1 min at 4 °C and harvested. The postnuclear supernatants were collected following centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Aliquots of the supernatants were incubated with 60 μl of an anti-galectin-4 conjugated-Sepharose 4B (5.5 mg of IgG/ml gel). Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled with Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12. 5% acrylamide) followed by blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated with anti-CEA and anti-galectin-4 antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated specific secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), visualized by using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Carbohydrate Binding Specificities of Galectin-4 N-domain and C-domain to Oligosaccharides—Galectin-4 has two conserved CRDs, which share 34% amino acid identity. Because we found that N- and C-domains of galectin-8 have distinct carbohydrate-binding specificities (10Ideo H. Seko A. Ishizuka I. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we prepared GST-fused recombinant proteins corresponding to the N-domain and the C-domain of galectin-4 (GST-N-domain and GST-C-domain, respectively) and compared their binding affinities toward oligosaccharides that had showed some binding ability to the full-length galectin-4 in our previous study (8Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Binding of various oligosaccharides to the immobilized recombinant proteins was measured by SPR. As summarized in Table II, the GST-N-domain and the GST-C-domain showed similar affinity toward three oligosaccharides, SO3−→3Lac−O−pNP, A-tetra, and LNF-I. On the other hand, the GST-C-domain showed a 12-fold higher affinity than the GST-N-domain for the SO3−→3core 1-O-Bn oligosaccharide. These results indicated that the two domains of galectin-4 have different carbohydrate-binding specificities with respect to SO3−→3core 1-O-Bn, which is a better ligand for the GST-C-domain than for the GST-N-domain.Table IIThe KD values of rhgalectin-4, GST-N-domain, and GST-C-domain for various oligosaccharidesOligosaccharideRhgalectin-4aIdeo et al.

Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and this structure occurs in certain glycosphingolipids. To investigate the interaction of galectin-4 with various glycosphingolipids (shown in Table I), we first measured the binding of galectin-4 to glycosphingolipid-coated plates, using an antibody against galectin-4. As shown in Fig. 1, galectin-4 bound strongly to SB1a, SM3, SM4s, and SB2, and bound weakly to GM1, SM2a, and GD1a. GalCer, LacCer, GM3, GM2, GM4, sLc4Cer, and snLc4Cer were not recognized by galectin-4, at least at the concentrations tested. These results indicated that galectin-4 recognizes the glycosphingolipids carrying 3-O-sulfated Gal residue, because this moiety is common among SB1a, SM3, SM4s, SB2 and SM2a. However, glycosphingolipids with a 3-O-sialylated Gal, such as sLc4Cer, snLc4Cer, GM3, GM2, and GM4, were not good ligands for galectin-4. This is in agreement with the fact that galectin-4 has a high affinity for SO3−→3Galβ1→3GalNAc but does not recognize 3'sialyl lactose (8Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Galectin-4 also bound to GM1; this could be explained by the fact that galectin-4 has a weak affinity for the Galβ1→3GalNAc structure (8Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We also measured the binding of GST-N- and -C-domains to glycosphingolipids. As shown in Fig. 2, both domains bound to glycosphingolipids tested; however, the affinity of GST-C-domain toward 3-O-sulfated glycosphingolipids SB1a and SM3 was higher than that of GST-N-domain. This characteristic of galectin-4 is different from galectin-8, of which only the N-domain has high affinity for glycosphingolipids (10Ideo H. Seko A. Ishizuka I. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The binding of galectin-4 to immobilized glycosphingolipids was further examined by SPR. As shown in Fig. 3, galectin-4 bound to SB1a and GM1 dose dependently and dissociated slowly (Fig. 3, A and B), but not to GM3 (Fig. 3C). The KD value to SB1a was 18.2 times lower than that of GM1. These results were in good agreement with the results of the ELISA. Galectin-4 Binds to the Sulfated Glycosphingolipids Present in Human Colon Adenocarcinoma CCK-81 Cells—Because galectin-4 is specifically expressed in intestine, colon, and stomach (5Rechreche H.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether these sulfoglycosphingolipids exist in these tissues. Our preliminary experiment showed that sulfoglycosphingolipids, including SM4, SM3, SM2, and SB1a, exist in chloroform-methanol extracts of mouse intestine, and galectin-4 and SB1a were stained in normal human colon epithelium in preliminary immunohistological study (data not shown). For further study, we searched human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines that express galectin-4. Among eight cell lines tested, we found that CCK-81 cells produce higher levels of galectin-4. We first examined what kinds of glycosphingolipids exist in human colon adenocarcinoma CCK-81 cells. Chloroform-methanol extracts were separated by TLC and visualized with both primuline (Fig. 4A, lane 1) and Azure A (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Mobilities of primuline staining-positive bands a, b, c, d, e, f, and g (Fig. 4, lane 1) corresponded to those of authentic phosphatidylethanolamine (and SM4), SM3, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine (and SM2), GM3, SB1a, and GM1, respectively, and bands a, b, c, d, and f were also stained with Azure A reagent (Fig. 4, lane 2). Faint or no bands were detected by primuline staining at the positions for authentic GM1 and GD1a. When the bands a to g were extracted and individually coated on ELISA plates, galectin-4 bound to each of these glycosphingolipids a, b, and f, which correspond to authentic SM4, SM3, and SB1a, respectively, and did not bind to bands c, d, e, and g (Fig. 4B). When we detected the phospholipids with Dittmer-Lester reagent, bands a, c, and d were stained (data not shown) and bands a and d were also stained with ninhydrin reagent. Sufficient amounts of authentic phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine were Azure A-positive, suggesting that primuline-positive bands a, c, and d contain phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine, respectively. Galectin-4-binding component in band a should be SM4, because galectin-4 did not bind to phosphatidylethanolamine (data not shown). These results indicated that galectin-4 reactive-sulfated glycosphingolipids are prominent in human colon adenocarcinoma CCK-81 cells, in comparison with sialylated glycosphingolipids on the basis of comparative primuline staining. The similar results for lipid compositions were also obtained in LS174T cells (data not shown). Galectin-4 Is Colocalized with SB1a, GM1, and CEA in Patches on the Cell Surface of CCK-81 and/or LS174T Cells—Subsequently, we studied whether sulfated glycosphingolipids are colocalized with galectin-4 on the cell surface of human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. Interestingly, when we stained the cell surface of CCK-81 and LS174T cells with anti-galectin-4, galectin-4 was localized in patches on the cell surface (Fig. 5). The anti-SB1a stained the same area as anti-galectin-4, suggesting the colocalization with galectin-4 (Fig. 5, A and D). Anti-SB1a antibody, which specifically binds to sulfated glycosphingolipid containing a SO3−→3Galβ1→3GalNAc residue, has weak cross-reactivity with SM3 (18Hiraiwa N. Iida N. Ishizuka I. Itai S. Shigeta K. Kannagi R. Fukuda Y. Imura H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6769-6774PubMed Google Scholar). When the proteins of CCK-81 cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and were stained with anti-SB1a antibody using standard techniques, no positive bands were detected. Furthermore, methanol fixation of CCK-81 cells on the coverslips greatly reduced the SB1a staining, and dipping the coverslips into chloroform/methanol (2:1) for a short time completely diminished this staining (data not shown), thus supporting that anti-SB1a antibody specifically reacts to sulfated glycosphingolipids, but not to glycoproteins. Anti-GM1 antibody also stained the similar area as anti-galectin-4 (Fig. 5B), although the relative content of GM1 was less than that of SB1a (Fig. 4). However, the localization of caveolin-1/VIP21 was different from that of galectin-4 (Fig. 5C). CEA was localized in the similar area as anti-galectin-4 (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that galectin-4 is localized in patches, which involve SB1a, GM1, and CEA on the cell surface of CCK-81 and/or LS174T cells. Immobilized Galectin-4 Bound to CCK-81 Cells through 3-O-Sulfated Glycosphingolipids—Sequentially, we investigated whether the galectin-4 on the cell surface of CCK-81 cells is related to cell adhesion. Galectin-4 immobilized on plates promoted the adhesion of CCK-81 cells in a dose-dependent manner in Ca2+-free condition (Fig. 6A), whereas plates without galectin-4 failed to support cell adhesion (Fig. 6B). Galectin-4 did not bind to Chinese hamster ovary cells (Fig. 6A), which contain LacCer and GM3 as glycosphingolipids (19Warnock D.E. Roberts C. Lutz M.S. Blackburn W.A. Young Jr., W.W. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10145-10153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glycoproteins with Neu5Acα2→3Gal residues at the non-reducing termini (20Fukushima K. Watanabe H. Takeo K. Nomura M. Asahi T. Yamashita K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), consistent with the fact that galectin-4 has no affinity toward Neu5Acα2→3Gal residues (8Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Anti-SB1a effectively inhibited the binding of CCK-81 cells to galectin-4-coated plates (Fig. 6B), suggesting that galectin-4 binds to CCK-81 cells through 3-O-sulfated glycosphingolipids without Ca2+ and stimulates adhesion of CCK-81 cells. Galectin-4 Binding to CEA by SPR and Coimmunoprecipitation of CEA with Anti-galectin-4 Antibody in LS174T Cells—We next examined whether CEA binds to galectin-4. CEA bound to galectin-4-immobilized sensor chip dose-dependently with a KD value of 2 × 10-8 m and was eluted with 0.1 m lactose (Fig. 7A). CEA did not bind to galectin-4 when it was injected with 10 mm lactose (data not shown). Because CEA carries 25–27 mol of tri- and tetra-antennary complex type of N-glycans per molecule (14Fukushima K. Ohkura T. Kanai M. Kuroki M. Matsuoka Y. Kobata A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the clustered non-reducing terminal Galβ1→4(3)GlcNAc and Fucα1→2Galβ1→3(4)GlcNAc residues seem to bind to galectin-4, although the KD value of each Galβ1→4(3)GlcNAc residue binding to galectin-4 is rather higher than Galβ1→3GalNAc (8Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We could not detect the distinct CEA band in CCK-81 cell lysates by anti-CEA antibody, because CEA in CCK-81 cells may be immediately released into the medium (21Ichiki S. Kuroki M. Kuroki M. Koga Y. Matsuoka Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1986; 77: 462-472PubMed Google Scholar). We could detect CEA in LS174T cell lysates and in the immunoprecipitated fraction by anti-galectin-4 antibody (Fig. 7B). Binding of LS174T Cells to Galectin-4 was Inhibited by CEA—Sequentially, it was examined whether the expression of CEA on LS174T cells influences the cell adhesion toward galectin-4. LS174T cells also bound to the galectin-4-coated plate dose-dependently, but the bound cells were much lower than those of CCK-81 cells (Fig. 7C, filled circles). Anti-SB1a antibody effectively inhibited the binding of LS174T cells to galectin-4-coated plates (Fig. 7C), suggesting that galectin-4 also binds to LS174T cells through 3-O-sulfated glycosphingolipids without Ca2+. After the galectin-4-immobilized plates were pre-incubated with CEA at 37 °C for 2 h, LS174T cells diminished the binding ability via sulfated glycosphingolipids to the galectin-4-coated plates (Fig. 7D), suggesting that the exogenous CEA suppresses the binding of galectin-4 molecule to sulfated glycosphingolipids. These results suggest that galectin-4 binds to both SB1a and CEA in the specific patches on the cell surface of CCK-81 and/or LS174T cells and modulates their adhesion. We have clearly demonstrated in this study that galectin-4 binds strongly to glycosphingolipids carrying SO3−→3Gal, including SM4, SM3, and SB1a, but not to glycosphingolipids carrying Siaα2→3Gal, including sLc4Cer, snLc4Cer, GM3, GM2, and GM4, and that these sulfated glycosphingolipids exist in human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Fig. 4), and mouse intestine and human colon epithelium (data not shown). We also found that (sulfated)-glycosphingolipids and galectin-4 are colocalized on the cell surface of human colon adenocarcinoma cells by an immunocytochemical assay (Fig. 5, A and D). The galectin-4/SB1a immunoreactive area is distinct from the anti-caveolin/VIP21 immunoreactive area (Fig. 5C), but similar to anti-GM1 immunoreactive area (Fig. 5B), suggesting that galectin-4 is localized in a kind of glycosphingolipids-rich patches on the cell surface of CCK-81 cells and LS174T cells. CEA was also stained in a galectin-4-rich area (Fig. 5E). It is known that GPI-anchored proteins are specifically targeted to apical membranes of polarized epithelial cells (22Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), and many GPI-anchored proteins are sorted to glycolipid-enriched membrane subdomains (23Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this galectin-4-SB1a-rich domain may be a kind of platform for GPI-anchored glycoproteins in colon adenocarcinoma cells. Moreover, galectin-4 immobilized on plates promoted adhesion of CCK-81 cells through sulfated glycosphingolipids (SB1a) (Fig. 6), suggesting that secreted galectin-4 modulates cell-cell adhesion via sulfated glycosphingolipids on the cell surface of CCK-81 cells. Sulfated glycosphingolipids are known to bind specifically to diverse adhesion proteins such as laminin, selectins, and anti-coagulant factors in vitro (9Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). For example, Suzuki et al. (24Suzuki Y. Toda Y. Tamatani T. Watanabe T. Suzuki T. Nakao T. Murase K. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Tadano-Aritomi K. Ishizuka I. Miyasaka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) reported that L-selectin binds to SM4, SM3, SB2, and SB1a. These facts imply that secreted or cell surface galectin-4 may also modulate the interaction of these proteins with sulfated glycosphingolipids, because galectin-4 interacts with the membrane through adhesion to sulfated glycosphingolipids. Galectin-4 also binds to LS174T cells through sulfated glycosphingolipids (Fig. 7C), and CEA suppressed galectin-4 binding to sulfated glycosphingolipids on LS174T cells (Fig. 7D). Because galectin-4 has much higher affinity for the SO3−→3Galβ1→3GalNAc residue of SB1a than for Galβ1→4(3)GlcNAc and Fucα1→2Galβ1→3(4)GlcNAc residues in glycoproteins (Table II), the binding between galectin-4 and sulfated glycosphingolipids may function for the cell adhesion of epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract. It has been reported that CEA mediates homotypic as well as heterotypic intercellular adhesion (25Obrink B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, the expression patterns of CEA in malignant cells suggested that CEA functions as a cell-contact inhibitory molecule rather than as an adhesion molecule (26von Kleist S. Migule I. Halla B. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 1889-1894PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the overexpression of CEA on the surface of tumor cells suppresses the galectin-4 binding to the sulfated glycosphingolipids and may facilitate migration and motility of tumor cells, i.e. metastases formation. Binding of galectins-1 and -3 to CEA in cell lysates of adenocarcinoma cells has been reported (27Ohannesian D.W. Lotan D. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5992-6000PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ohannesian D.W. Lotan D. Thomas P. Jessup J.M. Fukuda M. Gabius H.J. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2191-2199PubMed Google Scholar). However, galectin-1 is abundant in muscles, neurons, thymus, kidney, and placenta (1Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and galectin-3 is abundant in lung, artery, thymus, and spleen (29Crittenden S.L. Roff C.F. Wang J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1252-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); expression of these proteins in intestine and colon is quite low in comparison with galectin-4. In fact, we could not detect galectin-3 on the cell surface of LS174T cells by immunofluorescence analysis. Because Danielsen et al. (30Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that galectin-4 is present in the detergent-insoluble complex of pig intestine, galectin-4 may be one of the major ligands for CEA in the epithelium of alimentary tracts. On the other hand, there are several reports that sulfated glycosphingolipids serve as receptors for bacterial or viral toxins. A human respiratory pathogen, Bordetella pertussis, binds to SM4 and glycosphingolipids containing a GalNAcβ1→4Gal sequence (31Brennan M.J. Hannah J.H. Leininger E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18827-18831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Influenza A viruses bind to sulfatides (32Suzuki T. Sometani A. Yamazaki Y. Horiike G. Mizutani Y. Masuda H. Yamada M. Tahara H. Xu G. Miyamoto D. Oku N. Okada S. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Ito T. Kawaoka Y. Suzuki Y. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and neutrophil-activating protein of Helicobacter pylori binds to SM4 and SO3−→3Galβ1→3GalNAcβ1→4Galβ1→4Glcβ1→Cer (33Teneberg S. Miller-Podraza H. Lampert H.C. Evans Jr., D.J. Evans D.G. Danielsson D. Karlsson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19067-19071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). SM4 and some sulfated glycosphingolipids are expressed in mammal gastrointestinal tract (9Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We also found that SB1a exists in mouse intestine and human colon epithelium (data not shown). Because galectin-4 is specifically expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, galectin-4 may play a role in host defense by masking the sulfated glycosphingolipids from bacterial or viral toxins. The anti-SB1a antibody was originally obtained using the acidic glycolipid mixture prepared from human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (PLC/PRF/5) as immunogens. Although the SB1a antigen is a relatively minor glycolipid in hepatic cells, the anti-SB1a antibody strongly stained the surface of PLC/PRF/5 cells (18Hiraiwa N. Iida N. Ishizuka I. Itai S. Shigeta K. Kannagi R. Fukuda Y. Imura H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6769-6774PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the glycolipids extracted from hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and cirrhotic livers of patients and from a normal liver revealed that SB1a is expressed in some hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (5 of 17 cases) but not expressed in the cirrhotic liver and normal liver (34Hiraiwa N. Fukuda Y. Imura H. Tadano-Aritomi K. Nagai K. Ishizuka I. Kannagi R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2917-2928PubMed Google Scholar). We found that SB1a was expressed on the surface of human colon adenocarcinoma cells (CCK-81 and LS174T cells) (Fig. 5) but not expressed on the surface of another type of human colon adenocarcinoma cell, M7609 (data not shown). These data suggest that the surface expression or disappearance of SB1a might be related to the respective characters of carcinoma. Plant-derived lectins have been used for as lymphocyte-stimulating reagents, and some endogenous mammalian lectins also play an important role in immune responses by cross-linking certain cell surface glycoreceptors (35Lowe J.B. Cell. 2001; 104: 809-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 36Rudd P.M. Elliott T. Cresswell P. Wilson I.A. Dwek R.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is thought that glycosphingolipids, which are abundant in detergent-resistant membranes, influence signal transduction by modulating the binding of exogenous effectors to cell surface receptors (37Hakomori S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 38Miljan E.A. Meuillet E.J. Mania-Farnell B. George D. Yamamoto H. Simon H.G. Bremer E.G. J. Biol.

Accordingly, secreted galectin-4 may be able to cross-link cell surface ligands and thereby may mediate or modulate cell responses. It has been recently reported that galectin-4 stimulates interleukin-6 production by intestinal CD4+ T-cells under inflammatory conditions (41Hokama A. Mizoguchi E. Sugimoto K. Shimomura Y. Tanaka Y. Yoshida M. Rietdijk S.T. de Jong Y.P. Snapper S.B. Terhorst C. Blumberg R.S. Mizoguchi A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 681-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Galectin-4 bound to sulfated glycosphingolipids and promoted cell adhesion, whereas CEA modulated this interaction by binding to galectin-4 on the cell surface of colon adenocarcinoma cells. Whether these glycoconjugates are involved in galectin-4-dependent cell responses and/or cell anoikis should be resolved in the next step."
https://openalex.org/W1977108937,"The CSB protein is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors and is essential for transcription-coupled DNA repair. The role of CSB in this DNA repair process is unclear, but the protein was found to remodel nucleosomes and alter DNA double helix conformation upon binding. Elucidating the nature of the change in DNA structure induced by CSB is of great interest for understanding the CSB mechanism of action. We analyzed the CSB·DNA complex by scanning force microscopy and measured a shortening of DNA contour length upon CSB binding in the presence of ATP. This DNA length reduction most likely results from DNA wrapping around the protein. Shorter DNA molecules were observed more frequently in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues. These results suggest that DNA wrapping depends on ATP binding, whereas ATP hydrolysis results in unwrapping. We also provide evidence suggesting that CSB binds DNA as a dimer. DNA wrapping and unwrapping allows CSB to actively alter the DNA double helix conformation, which could influence nucleosomes and other protein-DNA interactions.

DNA wrapping and unwrapping allows CSB to actively alter the DNA double helix conformation, which could influence nucleosomes and other protein-DNA interactions. In the eukaryotic cell nucleus, DNA is packaged in the highly compact structure of chromatin. DNA processing events in the nucleus, such as transcription, replication, recombination, and repair, are restricted by this packaging. To facilitate the interaction of proteins with nucleosomal DNA, a variety of chromatin remodeling factors use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to locally alter chromatin structure (1Varga-Weisz P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3076-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are characterized by the presence of an ATPase subunit from the SWI2/SNF2 family. Because human Brg1 and hBrm and Drosophila ISWI have nucleosome remodeling activity on their own (3Corona D.F. Langst G. Clapier C.R. Bonte E.J. Ferrari S. Tamkun J.W. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 4Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), the ATPase subunits are suggested to be the catalytic core of the remodeling complexes. All SWI2/SNF2 proteins contain seven conserved motifs, similar to those found in DNA/RNA helicases. Members of this family possess DNA-stimulated ATPase activity but no classical helicase activity. The current evidence suggests that these factors use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to generate torsion in DNA and alter local DNA conformation (1Varga-Weisz P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3076-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Havas K. Flaus A. Phelan M. Kingston R. Wade P.A. Lilley D.M. Owen-Hughes T.

Cell. 2001; 7: 97-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). How remodeling enzymes generate torsion is not known, but rotation of the DNA helix by DNA tracking activity or a molecular wrench action has been proposed (1Varga-Weisz P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3076-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Havas K. Flaus A. Phelan M. Kingston R. Wade P.A. Lilley D.M. Owen-Hughes T.

This may alter nucleosome structure by rotation of DNA at the nucleosomal entry/exit sites, causing its over- or underwinding and/or looping on the nucleosome surface. Interestingly, many mechanistically distinct DNA repair pathways include SWI2/SNF2 proteins, such as CSB for transcription-coupled repair (TCR), 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, transcription-coupled repair; pol II, polymerase II; TRCF, transcription-repair coupling factor; Lk, linking number; SFM, scanning force microscopy; DTT, dithiothreitol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. Rad5 for postreplication repair, Rad16 for global genome repair, and Rad54 for recombination repair. This suggests that nucleosome remodeling is an essential aspect of many DNA repair pathways. Apparently, remodeling of chromatin structure during repair of distinct lesions cannot be provided by a universal component. Therefore, the SW12/SNF2 proteins in each DNA repair pathway may provide additional pathway-specific functions. The TCR pathway of nucleotide excision repair is responsible for the rapid repair of transcription-blocking lesions in DNA (8Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The CSA and CSB proteins are specifically required for TCR, although their exact function in this process remains elusive. Inherited defects in these genes lead to Cockayne syndrome in humans (9Nance M.A. Berry S.A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 42: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that the Cockayne syndrome proteins have a subtle additional role in transcription (10Selby C.P. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11VandenBoom V. Citterio E. Hoogstraten D. Zotter A. Egly J.M. VanCappellen W.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Houtsmuller A.B. Vermeulen W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The elongating RNA polymerase II (pol II) complex that encounters a lesion is thought to detect damage and to activate the repair machinery in a CSA/CSB-dependent manner. However, the stalled pol II may constitute a steric hindrance for the repair machinery and likely needs to retract or dissociate to allow repair of the damage (12VandenBoom V. Jaspers N.G. Vermeulen W. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Some aspects of TCR are highly conserved from Escherichia coli to yeast and mammals (13Van der Van Gool A.J. Horst G.T.J. Citterio E. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4155-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF) displaces the RNA polymerase stalled at a lesion and stimulates TCR by recruiting the repair machinery. A similar activity was proposed for CSB (14Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21330-21336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because of its limited sequence similarities with TRCF. In agreement with this possible function, CSB was found to associate with pol II (15Van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. Os VanR. Vermeulen W. Constantinou A. Egly J.M. Bootsma D.

CSB has many of the activities expected for a SWI2/SNF2 protein; it has DNA-stimulated ATPase activity but is not a classical helicase (18Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol.

CSB remodels nucleosomes at the expense of ATP hydrolysis and interacts with core histones directly in vitro (20Van den Citterio E. Boom V. Schnitzler G. Kanaar R. Bonte E. Kingston R.E. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7643-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, CSB alters DNA double helix conformation upon binding. The mechanism by which CSB remodels nucleosomes is unknown, but by changing DNA conformation, CSB may disrupt the histone-DNA interactions, as well as the interaction of stalled pol II with damaged DNA. Resolving the nature of this CSB-induced change in DNA conformation will therefore provide important information on the mechanism of CSB action in both DNA repair and gene transcription. CSB alters DNA conformation as detected in assays that fix and report changes in DNA linking number (Lk) (20Van den Citterio E. Boom V. Schnitzler G. Kanaar R. Bonte E. Kingston R.E. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7643-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Lk is a topological parameter of double-stranded DNA that describes the number of times that the two strands of the DNA double helix wind around each other. Lk is made up of two geometrical parameters, twist and writhe. Twist describes the number of crossings of one strand of the DNA double helix over the other, whereas writhe describes crossings of the axis of the double helix over itself. Topoisomerases change DNA Lk directly by breaking, passing, and rejoining of DNA strands, but this activity has not been detected for CSB or other SWI2/SNF2 family members. The change in DNA conformation induced by CSB can be caused by the protein constraining twist or writhe. Proteins can affect writhe by wrapping the DNA around their surface (21White J.H. Cozzarelli N.R. Bauer W.R. Science. 1988; 241: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), such as in nucleosomes (22Klug A. Rhodes D. Smith J. Finch J.T. Thomas J.O. Nature. 1980; 287: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Proteins can affect twist by stretching the DNA helix in a protein filament (23Kosikov K.M. Gorin A.A. Zhurkin V.B. Olson W.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1301-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), such as the recombinases RecA and Rad51 (24Ogawa T. Yu X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Finally, the change in DNA conformation may result from the introduction of unconstrained supercoils in the DNA by a protein translocation mechanism. This was suggested for the yeast SWI2/SNF2-like remodeling enzyme RSC (25Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and for Rad54 (26Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol.

A. 2001; 98: 8454-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the different mechanisms that induce changes in DNA conformation by affecting twist or writhe are not easily distinguished in bulk biochemical assays. They do result in architecturally different DNA·protein complexes and therefore can be distinguished by direct observation with scanning force microscopy (SFM). Analysis of DNA conformational changes and direct imaging of CSB·DNA complexes by SFM suggest that CSB constrains writhe by a DNA wrap. Wrapping of DNA was found to depend on ATP binding, whereas the constrained wrap is apparently lost upon ATP hydrolysis. This active DNA wrapping and unwrapping by CSB is discussed as a mechanism to disrupt nearby protein-DNA interactions. DNA Substrates—The plasmid pDERI1 (1.8 kb) was described previously (27Ristic D. Wyman C. Paulusma C. Kanaar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8454-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This plasmid was singly nicked in a 30-μl reaction containing 0.5 μg of DNA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 360 μg/ml etidium bromide, and 1 μg/ml DNase I at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 volume of stop mix (5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 30 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubation at 65 °C for 30 min. DNA was purified by chloroform/phenol extraction, ethanol precipitated, and dissolved in H2O. The linear DNA substrate was generated by digestion of plasmid pDERI1 with the PvuI restriction enzyme (Roche Applied Science) and purified using the GFX-PCR purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins—The recombinant epitope-tagged CSB protein (HA-CSB-his6) was overexpressed using the baculovirus expression system and purified as described previously (19Citterio E. Van der Rademakers S.

The tags do not interfere with the biological function of CSB in vivo (19Citterio E. Van der Rademakers S. Horst G.T.J. Van Gool A.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vermeulen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11844-11851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Protein concentration and purity was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. ATPase activity of the purified CSB was tested in vitro. The Ku70/80 heterodimer was produced and purified as described previously (28Ono M. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The E. coli RNA polymerase was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Topological Assays—The singly nicked plasmid pDERI1 (20 ng) was incubated with the indicated amounts of CSB in the presence of 5 mm of ATP or AMP-PNP in a 60-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and subsequently one unit of E. coli DNA ligase was added along with ligation buffer containing NAD. The incubation was continued for 1 h. Topoisomers were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml chloroquine. Gels were run in 1× Tris borate EDTA for 20 h at 70 V, followed by Southern blotting, hybridization with a pDERI1-probe, and autoradiography. Protein-DNA Binding Reactions and SFM—CSB·DNA complexes were prepared by incubating 250 ng of singly nicked plasmid pDERI1 with 20 ng of CSB (protein to DNA ratio is 1:2) in the presence or absence of 5 mm ATP or AMP-PNP in a 10-μl volume containing 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 120 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The Ku70/80 heterodimer (75 ng) was incubated with the 1-kb PCR fragment (250 ng) in a 10-μl reaction containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 20 min. The E. coli RNA polymerase (250 ng) was bound to the 1-kb PCR fragment (250 ng) in a 20-μl reaction containing 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT. The binding reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Binding reactions were diluted 15- to 30-fold in deposition buffer (5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgCl2) and directly deposited onto freshly cleaved mica. After a 1-min incubation, the mica surface was washed with H2O (glass-distilled, Sigma) and dried with a stream of filtered air. For the simultaneous deposition of protein·DNA complexes from different binding reactions, the reactions were combined at the dilution step and immediately deposited onto mica. The protein·DNA complexes were imaged in air at room temperature and humidity using a Nanoscope IIIa (Digital Instruments) operating in tapping mode with a type E scanner. Images were collected as 2 × 2 μm scans (512 × 512 pixels). The raw data were processed only by flattening to remove background slope using Nanoscope software. Silicon tips (Nanoprobes) were obtained from Digital Instruments. Image Analysis—DNA contour length was measured from SFM images using the Alex toolbox (29Rivetti C. Walker C. Bustamante C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 41-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) in Matlab (The Math Works, Inc.). DNA contours were manually traced and subsequently smoothed. For DNA·protein complexes, the contour length was traced as the shortest possible DNA path through the bound protein. The volume of the DNA-bound protein complexes was measured from SFM images imported into Image-SXM (National Institutes of Health Image version modified by Steve Barrett, Surface Science Research Center, University of Liverpool, UK). The protein was manually traced, and its area and average height were measured, as described previously (30Wyman C. Rombel I. North A.K. Bustamante C. Kustu S. Science. 1997; 275: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A background volume determined from the same size area, including a segment of DNA, was subtracted. Volume measurements are given in arbitrary units and are used only to compare the relative sizes of proteins. Immunoprecipitation—The GFP-CSB expressing cell line was generated by stable transfection of the CSB-deficient human fibroblast cell line CS1AN-Sv with GFP-CSB cDNA (11VandenBoom V. Citterio E. Hoogstraten D. Zotter A. Egly J.M. VanCappellen W.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Houtsmuller A.B. Vermeulen W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). GFP-CSB is functional in vivo, as it corrects the UV-sensitive phenotype of CSB-deficient cells. The plasmid pFLAG-CSB was transfected into the stable GFP-CSB cell line using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two days after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cell extracts were prepared. The cells were lysed in 1 volume of whole cell extract lysis buffer 1 (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 600 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 30 min of incubation on ice, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and 1 volume of whole cell extract buffer 2 (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. The whole cell extract was incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The FLAG-agarose was washed 3 times for 5 min with NETT buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Trition, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bound proteins were eluted by SDS sample buffer, separated by 6% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a mouse monoclonal antibody to CSB (1A11) (31Bradsher J. Proietti de Auriol J. Santis L. Iben S. Vonesch J.L. Grummt I. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 819-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). CSB Changes DNA Double Helix Conformation Dependent on ATP Binding—The ability of CSB to change DNA conformation was demonstrated in topological assays. Singly nicked plasmid DNA was incubated with the purified CSB protein (19Citterio E. Van der Rademakers S. Horst G.T.J. Van Gool A.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vermeulen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11844-11851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Van den Citterio E. Boom V. Schnitzler G. Kanaar R. Bonte E. Kingston R.E. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7643-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and subsequently, the nick was closed by the addition of DNA ligase. Ligation will fix changes in DNA conformation induced by the protein. Protein-induced changes in DNA conformation, evident as changes in Lk after ligation, were detected as changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the DNA. Ligation of the nicked plasmid in the absence of CSB resulted in three major topoisomers (Fig. 1, lane 1). In the absence of ATP, addition of 60 or 90 ng of CSB induced a subtle shift in the DNA topoisomer distribution (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). The intensity of the lower band was decreased, whereas the intensity of a fourth slower migrating topoisomer was increased. In the presence of ATP, CSB induced a more apparent shift in the distribution of the topoisomers, as the intensity of the fourth slower migrating topoisomer was further increased (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). Interestingly, in the presence of CSB and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP, the three major topoisomers were completely shifted toward slower migrating species (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7). The chloroquine included in the gel caused positive supercoiling of DNA. In the presence of ATP, CSB shifted the topoisomer population toward less positively supercoiled topoisomers, indicating that CSB introduced negative supercoiling (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). In the presence of CSB and AMP-PNP, the DNA topoisomer distribution was dramatically shifted. All positive supercoiling introduced in the DNA by chloroquine in the gel was eliminated, resulting in negatively supercoiled topoisomers, which have a different mobility compared with the positively supercoiled topoisomers (Fig. 1, compare lanes 4 and 5 to 6 and 7). At lower protein to DNA ratios (Fig. 1, lanes 12-14), CSB introduced less negative supercoiling. On average, two negative supercoils were introduced at an approximate molar ratio of 7 CSB monomers/1 DNA molecule of 1.8 kb (Fig. 1, lane 14; 20 ng of CSB) in the presence of AMP-PNP. Although there is some residual activity in the absence of ATP, the introduction of negative supercoiling by CSB appears to depend on ATP-binding and is reduced when ATP hydrolysis is possible. These results demonstrate that CSB actively changes DNA conformation dependent on ATP-binding by the introduction of constrained negative supercoiling.Fig. 1CSB induces negative supercoiling in DNA dependent on ATP-binding. Singly nicked plasmid DNA was incubated with the indicated amount of CSB (ng), with (lanes 4 and 5) or without ATP (lanes 2 and 3) or AMP-PNP (lanes 6 and 7 and lanes 11-14). The nick was ligated, and the resulting topoisomer distribution was analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml chloroquine. As a control reaction, the nicked DNA was ligated in the absence of CSB (lanes 1 and 11, -). The nicked plasmid DNA (N), topoisomerase I-treated plasmid DNA (T), and linear DNA (L) were analyzed in parallel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Architecture of the CSB·DNA Complex—The topological assays revealed that CSB-induced changes in DNA conformation were trapped as negative Lk because of the introduction of negative supercoiling upon CSB binding. This change in DNA Lk could result from changes in twist or writhe. Proteins can change writhe by wrapping DNA around their surface. Proteins can change twist by stretching the helix in a protein filament. To discriminate between these possibilities, we used SFM to directly visualize individual CSB·DNA complexes. CSB protein was incubated with a singly nicked circular DNA molecule in the absence or presence of ATP or AMP-PNP. Fig. 2 shows SFM images of CSB·DNA complexes formed in the presence of ATP. The appearance of the CSB·DNA complexes formed in the presence or absence of ATP or AMP-PNP was similar. Under all conditions, ∼12% of the DNA molecules was bound by CSB. The percentage of DNA bound by CSB was similar for nicked circular, closed circular, and linear DNA templates, indicating that CSB does not specifically bind to nicks or DNA ends. We found no evidence for protein-coated filaments or elongated DNA structures in these images. This indicates that CSB is unlikely to alter DNA conformation by changing twist. Interestingly, in the presence of ATP or AMP-PNP, many of the CSB·DNA complexes observed were indicative of DNA wrapping. The DNA did not appear to pass through the center of the protein but rather entered and exited the protein on one side (Fig. 2, B and C). CSB Binding Shortens DNA Contour Length Dependent on ATP Binding—When CSB affects DNA structure by constraining writhe due to DNA wrapping, this results in a decrease in contour length of the DNA·protein complexes relative to protein-free DNA. We measured the contour length of free singly nicked circular DNA molecules and DNA molecules bound by CSB in the same deposition. These results are shown in Fig. 3 and are summarized in Table I. In the absence of ATP, there was no significant difference in the DNA contour length of CSB-bound DNA molecules and free DNA molecules (Fig. 3A). However, in the presence of ATP, a shift in the distribution and a significant reduction in the average DNA contour length was observed upon binding of CSB (Fig. 3B). The distribution of the DNA lengths suggests that two populations of CSB-bound complexes were present, one with and one without shortened contour length.Table IMean DNA contour lengthNo cofactorATPAMP-PNPFree DNA549 ± 1.9 (198)aMean DNA contour length in nm ± S.E.

(number of molecules measured) Open table in a new tab Because the CSB-induced change in DNA conformation was most pronounced in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, in the topological assays, we also analyzed the DNA contour length under these conditions. There was a more pronounced shift toward shorter DNA contour lengths upon binding of CSB in the presence of AMP-PNP, indicating that more CSB-bound DNA molecules are present with a shorter contour length (Fig. 3, B and C). The average contour length measured for CSB-bound DNA molecules was 40 nm shorter in the presence of AMP-PNP. However, the presence of CSB-bound DNA molecules that are not shorter will result in a slight underestimation of the shortening. The protein-free 1821-bp DNA molecule has an average contour length of 548 nm in our images. Thus 40 nm represents an average DNA contour length reduction of 125 bp as a result of CSB binding in the presence of AMP-PNP. Preliminary experiments with the CSB mutant K538R, containing a mutation in the ATP-binding domain that allows binding of ATP but not hydrolysis (20Van den Citterio E. Boom V. Schnitzler G. Kanaar R. Bonte E. Kingston R.E. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7643-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), suggested a similar DNA contour length reduction upon binding in the presence of ATP and AMP-PNP (results not shown). Although the path of DNA cannot be followed in these images, the loss of this relatively large amount of DNA can most easily be explained by DNA wrapping around the protein surface (see “Discussion”). These results suggest that CSB wraps on average 125 bp of DNA around its surface dependent on ATP binding but not hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis may result in DNA unwrapping, because shorter DNA molecules were observed more frequently in the presence of AMP-PNP. Size of the DNA-bound CSB Protein—The size of a protein can be estimated from SFM images by measuring its volume. This is especially useful for determining the size of DNA-bound proteins (30Wyman C. Rombel I. North A.K. Bustamante C. Kustu S. Science. 1997; 275: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Although the absolute dimensions of biomolecules in SFM images will vary with the deposition and the specific tip used (32C. Bustamante D.K. Yang. G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 363-372Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar), there is a linear relationship between SFM-measured volume and molecular mass (30Wyman C. Rombel I. North A.K. Bustamante C. Kustu S. Science. 1997; 275: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 33Ratcliff G.C. Erie D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5632-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus the size of a protein of interest can be determined by comparison of its volume to that of a protein size standard included in the same deposition. CSB has a molecular mass of 168 kDa, and we used E. coli RNA polymerase (450 kDa) and the Ku70/80 heterodimer (155 kDa) as internal standards. CSB was bound to singly nicked circular DNA, and the protein standard was bound to a linear DNA fragment in separate binding reactions. The reactions were mixed together immediately before deposition for imaging. Control reactions, in which CSB was bound to circular DNA and mixed with naked linear DNA just before deposition, did not result in protein transfer to the linear DNA (results not shown). Therefore, CSB could be distinguished from the protein standard by the DNA substrate to which it was bound. Fig. 4 shows CSB bound to circular DNA (Fig. 4, A and B, black arrows) together with RNA polymerase (Fig. 4A, white arrows) or with"

Stably transformed insulinoma cell lines (MIN6) were created with small interfering RNA resulting in the reduction of insulin receptor (IR) expression up to 80% (insulin receptor knockdown, IRKDΔ80). Functionally perturbed IR signaling was confirmed with the absence of insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate 1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Additionally, Akt phosphorylation was reduced and responded poorly to glucose stimulation. Gene expression profiling revealed that reduced IR expression was associated with alterations in expression of >1,500 genes with diverse functions. IRKD cells exhibited low rate of proliferation due to delay in transition from G0/G1 to S phase, whereas susceptibility to apoptosis did not differ from that of control cells. Insulin content was reduced in proportion to the reduction of IR. IRKD cells maintained glucose responsiveness as measured by NAD(P)H generation, whereas Ca2+ responses and insulin secretion were enhanced. IRKDΔ80 and control cells were treated with glucose (25 mm) or insulin (100 nm) for 45 min, and gene expression profiles were assessed. Transcriptional activation of several hundred early response genes common to both glucose and insulin stimulation was observed in control cells. In IRKDΔ80 cells, insulin failed to activate any genes as anticipated. Importantly, glucose stimulation of gene expression in IRKDΔ80 cells showed that most genes previously activated by glucose were no longer activated, suggesting a major autocrine/paracrine effect of insulin on glucose-regulated gene expression. On the other hand, there were a number of glucose-regulated genes in the IRKDΔ80 cells that were not previously observed in control cells, suggesting a feedback regulation of insulin signaling on glucose-regulated gene expression. These results demonstrate important roles of the insulin receptor in islet β cell gene expression and function and may serve to elucidate molecular defects in animal models with diminished β cell insulin signaling.

Metab. 2001; 86: 4047-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Changes in plasma glucose concentration along with various hormones and growth factors have been shown to be major determinants of insulin secretion, biosynthesis, and islet mass (3Hugl S.R.

The islet β cell responds to these changes in its environment by altering its transcriptional responses, and these changes in gene expression ultimately result in altered mass and function. However, the signaling pathways activated by these environmental changes and the ensuing transcriptional events that mediate these biological responses are only beginning to be elucidated. Specifically, the relationships between the signaling pathways activated by glucose and those activated by growth factors such as insulin remain unclear. The roles of insulin as a growth factor in the modulation of β cell mass and function have been implied by the results of recent experiments. Glucose stimulation of β cells in culture has been shown to result in the activation of the IR as does the application of exogenous insulin, suggesting that insulin secreted from β cells binds to its receptor eliciting a physiological response (5Rothenberg P.L.

Furthermore, the potential importance of autocrine/paracrine insulin signaling in pancreatic β cells, especially on β cell mass, was highlighted by the β cell-specific insulin receptor (IR) 1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; βIRKO, β cell-specific insulin receptor knock-out; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FBS, fetal calf serum; IRKD, insulin receptor knockdown; RT, reverse transcription; qRT, quantitative RT; CI, confidence intervals; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; PI3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IRS, insulin receptor substrate. knock-out (βIRKO) mouse model (16Kulkarni R.N.

However, in the case of the βIRKO mouse model, the conclusion that insulin signaling in the β cell is important for controlling β cell mass is confounded by hypothalamic reduction of the insulin receptor with concomitant tendency to obesity and insulin resistance that may have secondary harmful effects on the β cell. Additionally, Wicksteed et al. (21Wicksteed B. Alarcon C. Briaud I. Lingohr M.K. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42080-42090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that neither endogenous or exogenous insulin affected insulin secretion, proinsulin translation, preproinsulin mRNA levels, or total protein synthesis in primary cultures of rodent islets for either short (1 h) or long (24 h) incubation. Thus together these studies leave open the question of whether insulin, acting through autocrine/paracrine effects, is a modulator of β cell function and mass. Because it is difficult to dissect molecular defects in animal models that result in reduction of the small amount of islet tissue, we approached this problem by studying glucose-responsive insulinoma cells in culture. In these studies, we sought to define the roles of insulin signaling through its receptor in β cell and the effects of glucose on these processes. Creation of stable insulinoma cell lines expressing small interfering RNA (siRNA) to reduce the synthesis of the IR allowed us to examine the effects of reduced IR signaling on β cell function. Stable reduction of IR led to alterations in expression of an unexpected number of genes. Additionally, we observed a role of the IR in proliferation, insulin content, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and glucose-regulated early gene expression. Construction of siRNA Expressing Plasmids—A polIII-mediated small interfering RNA expressing plasmid vector system (pSUPER vector) was constructed according to the methods described by Brummelkamp et al. (22Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). 64-base DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to sense target sequence, hairpin loop, and antisense target sequence were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coraville, IA), annealed together, and then ligated into BglII and HindIII digested pSUPER vector. Plasmids were purified with Wizard Plus Maxipreps kit (Promega, Madison, WI). A target sequence against mouse IR was found, 5′-ACTGCATGGTTGCCCATGA-3′, which yielded a satisfactory loss of function. A control oligonucleotide with the same GC content and no corresponding mammalian gene, 5′-GCTACAGTAGACGGAATCG-3′, was utilized as a scrambled control. Cell Culture, Transfection of Insulinoma Cells, and Selection of Stably Transfected Clones—The MIN6 insulinoma cell line was a kind gift of Dr. Jun-ichi Miyazaki (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). MIN6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 5 μl/liter β-mercaptoethanol in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C (23Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Parental MIN6 cells used for plasmid transfection were between passages 24 and 26. Polyamine transfection reagent TransIT™-LT1 (Mirus Corporation, Madison, WI) was used to transfect the insulinoma cells according to the company's instructions. A total of 10 μg of pSUPER vector and 40 μlof TransIT-LT1 were used for each 10-cm plates. 1 μg of pCDNA 3.1 plasmid, which contains a neomycin cassette, was also transfected to each plate at the same time to facilitate selecting stably transfected cells with G418 (a neomycin derivative). The transfected cells were first selected with culture medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) for 4 weeks, and then isolated colonies of the surviving cells (defined as passage 4) were transferred to a 6-well tissue culture plate and maintained in culture medium with 200 μg/ml G418. Protein levels and mRNA expression were tested at passage 7–8, and clones were further maintained. MIN6 cells transfected with empty pSUPER vector were designated as Con(E), those with scrambled target sequence were referred to as Con(S), and those with reduced IR expression were designated as insulin receptor knockdown (IRKD). Con(E), Con(S), and IRKD cells were propagated by weekly passage and were used for experiments herein between passages 9 and 18, which corresponded to passages 33 and 42 of parental MIN6 cells. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total RNA was purified, and 1 μg was used to prepare cDNA, primed with random hexamers, and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. qRT-PCR was performed by monitoring in real time the increase in fluorescence of the SYBR Green dye (ABI) as described previously (24Morrison T.B. Weis J.J. Wittwer C.T. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 954-962PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wittwer C.T. Herrmann M.G. Moss A.A. Rasmussen R.P. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) using the ABI 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). For comparison of transcript levels between samples, a standard curve of cycle thresholds for serial dilutions of a cDNA sample was established and then used to calculate the relative abundance of each gene. Values were then normalized to the relative amounts of 18 S ribosomal RNA, which were obtained from a similar standard curve. This control was chosen after observing that 18 S rRNA levels correlated well with cyclophilin and tubulin mRNA levels when MIN6 cells were subject to different glucose concentrations for various durations including ones used in these studies. All of the PCR reactions were performed as at least replicates of four. Standard error of the quantity of transcript normalized to the amount of 18 S ribosomal RNA was calculated from a formula with consideration of error propagation. When gene expression levels of two conditions were compared, the ratio was expressed with standard error calculated from the same formula. Specificity of each primer pair was confirmed by melting curve analysis and agarose-gel electrophoresis of PCR products. Sequences of primers used in this study are as follows: insulin receptor, forward 5′-TTTGTCATGGATGGAGGCTA-3′ and reverse 5′-CCTCATCTTGGGGTTGAACT-3′; immediate early response 2 (Ier2), forward 5′-CAGCGATTTGAGCGACAGTA-3′ and reverse 5′-GGGTCCACAGTTCAGGAGAC-3′; early growth response 1 (Egr1), forward 5′-CGAATCTGCATGCGTAACTT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCAAACTTCCTCCCACAAAT-3′; inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2), forward 5′-GGACGACCCGATGAGTCT-3′ and reverse 5′-TGCTGGGCACCAGTTCCTT-3′; transducer of ErbB-2.1 (Tob1), forward 5′-GAAGAATAGTGGCCGTAGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-TTCAGGAGGTGGTTCACATT-3′; DNA segment, Chr4, Wayne State University 53, forward 5′-TTCGCCTGAGTGAGAAAGAT-3′ and reverse 5′-CAAGTCGAAGTTGGCTGTTC-3′; cyclin E1, forward 5′-TCGTTACATGGCATCACAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-AAACTGGTGCAACTTTGGAG-3′; Foxo3, forward 5′-ACTCCAAGACCTGCTTGCTT-3′ and reverse 5′-GGTGCTAGCCTGAGACATCA-3′; p21CIP1, forward 5′-CCTGACAGATTTCTATCACTCCA-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGGCAGCGTATATCAGGAG-3′; and cyclin D2, forward 5′-TTTCCTCTGGCCATGAATTA-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGCTTGGAAGCTAGGAACA-3′. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were incubated in medium containing 5 mm glucose and 2% FBS for 18 h (defined as “unstimulated” state) followed by treatment of 25 mm glucose or 100 nm insulin for indicated duration of time. Cells were lysed with buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01 m dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a tablet of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). For IRS-1 immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IRS-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) and immobilized on protein G-Sepharose beads. For Western blotting, total proteins or immunoprecipitates were separated by electrophoresis though 10% polyacrylamide, 0.1% SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes followed by immunoblotting. Immunodetection was performed with Western Lightning (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-insulin receptor β subunit (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-β actin (Sigma); anti-phosphospecific (Ser-473) Akt; anti-Akt; and anti-phosphotyrosine (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA). Labeling of RNA Transcripts for Microarray, Hybridization, and Data Acquisition—First strand cDNA was generated by oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription (Superscript II; Invitrogen) utilizing the 3DNA Array 50 kit (Genisphere) (26Manduchi E. Scearce L.M. Brestelli J.E. Grant G.R. Kaestner K.H. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 10: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Modified oligo(dT) primers were utilized in which a fluorophore/dendrimer-specific oligonucleotide sequence was attached to the 5′ end of the dT primer. Two hybridizations were carried out in a sequential manner. The primary hybridization was performed by adding 38 μl of sample to the microarray under a supported glass coverslip (Erie Scientific) at 50 °C for 16–20 h at high humidity in the dark. Secondary hybridizations were carried out using the complimentary capture reagents provided in the 3DNA Array 50 kit. Slides were scanned on a PerkinElmer ScanArray Express HT scanner to detect Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence. Laser power was kept constant for Cy3/Cy5 scans, and photomultiplier tube was varied for each experiment based on background fluorescence. Gridding and analysis of images were performed using QuantArray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Each spot was defined on a pixel-by-pixel basis using a modified Mann-Whitney statistical test. Microarray Sample Pairing—To assess gene expression alteration by comparing two conditions, transcripts from each sample were directly compared using EPCon-pancreatic cDNA microarray with ∼11,000 probes (27Kaestner K.H. Lee C.S. Scearce L.M. Brestelli J.E. Arsenlis A. Le P.P. Lantz K.A. Crabtree J. Pizarro A. Mazzarelli J. Pinney D. Fischer S. Manduchi E. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Gradwohl G. Clifton S.W. Brown J.R. Inoue H. Cras-Meneur C. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For each sample pair, transcripts from one condition were labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 and hybridized with the Cy5- or Cy3-labeled transcripts from the partner condition. Another pair of RNAs was also labeled-inverting dyes. Those pairs of hybridization were repeated twice. When unstimulated MIN6-Con and IRKDΔ80 cells were compared, four microarrays were used. For assessing transcriptional responses either to glucose or insulin treatment, a total of eight microarrays per cell line were used. Microarray Normalization and Statistical Analysis—In the microarray studies performed herein, normalization and statistical analyses were performed as follows. Only probes with a signal intensity of 2.0-fold or greater above the corresponding background intensity in both channels were chosen for calculation of fold changes. The intensity of each spot was adjusted by subtracting background intensities. The log ratio of Cy5 and Cy3 channel intensity of each spot was then calculated, and the median of the log ratio from all of the probes was subtracted from each log ratio (28Quackenbush J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). The log ratios from four pairs of “dye flip” hybridizations were utilized to estimate probe-specific measurement variation (29Yang I.V. Chen E. Hasseman J.P. Liang W. Frank B.C. Wang S. Sharov V. Saeed A.I. White J. Li J. Lee N.H. Yeatman T.J. Quackenbush J. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 062.1-062.12Google Scholar). Probe-specific measurement variation was subtracted from log fold change to calculate the final normalized log fold change (probe-specific normalization). From the pairing scheme, four direct ratios were obtained for each comparison. These ratios were used to calculate the average fold change as well as the mean ± S.E. 95% confidence intervals (CI, two standard errors away from the average fold change) were calculated with attention to the change of distribution when converting log fold change to fold change (30Chen Y. Kamat V. Dougherty E.R. Bittner M.L. Meltzer P.S. Trent J.M. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Criteria were set to assess changes in gene expression that included a fold change of 1.35 or more compared with “unstimulated.” This criterion was selected after observing that the mean variance of all of the probes was 0.15, and the false positive rate was estimated to be 0.0032%. With similar multiple hybridizations and cDNA microarrays, the fold change of 1.3–1.4 was utilized to identify significant gene expression change in other studies (31Woo A.L. Gildea L.A. Tack L.M.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2268-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Additionally, significant fold changes required that the 95% CI of the fold change, two standard errors away from the fold change, excluded 1. Thus any fold changes meeting these criteria could be considered significant with a p value of <0.05. Microarray Annotation and Gene Ontology Functions—Annotation for the clones on the arrays were performed as reported previously using BLASTn analysis against the public databases (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar, 35Wheeler D.L. Church D.M. Lash A.E. Leipe D.D. Madden T.L. Pontius J.U.

Gene ontology functions were gathered through the Source Repository (source.stanford.edu/) (36Diehn M. Sherlock G. Binkley G. Jin H. Matese J.C. Hernandez-Boussard T. Rees C.A. Cherry J.M. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Alizadeh A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and classified according to the categories provided by the Gene Ontology Consortium (www.geneontology.org/) (37Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. Harris M.A. Hill D.P. Issel-Tarver L. Kasarskis A. Lewis S. Matese J.C. Richardson J.E. Ringwald M. Rubin G.M. Sherlock G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (27278) Google Scholar). Hierarchical Clustering—Hierarchical clusters were performed using the Genesis software version 1.3 (Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria) (38Sturn A. Quackenbush J. Trajanoski Z. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 207-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar). Heat maps generated by hierarchical clustering were created using the average linkage clustering (Euclidean distances) directly from the logarithmic ratios (base e), and the intensity of those colors indicates the degree of fold changes in natural log scale (above 1.5 or below -1.5 fold changes are saturated). BrdUrd Incorporation—Two days before the procedure, cells were seeded onto 25-mm glass coverslips at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Medium was changed once 24 h before the procedure, and then during the last hour of culturing, BrdUrd (10 μm) was added to the medium. Detection of BrdUrd was carried out with immunohistochemistry utilizing anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for identifying nucleus. At least four different fields from each coverslip were selected to count at least 2,000 cells to calculate the rate of BrdUrd-positive cells. Shown are the results from six independent samples from each of the cell lines. Cell Cycle Analysis with Flow Cytometry—Cells were lifted off the plates with trypsin-EDTA and were resuspended in PBS containing 1% FBS and then fixed with 70% ethanol. Cells were resuspended again in PBS containing 30 μg/ml propidium iodine and 250 mg/ml RNase A and further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h before analysis with a FACSCalibur laser-based flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The cell cycle phase distribution was analyzed with FLOWJO software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Apoptosis Assays—The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique was used to detect DNA strand breaks formed during apoptosis (39Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9156) Google Scholar). Cells on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 45min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100. After a rinse with PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dUTP in the presence of enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase for 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides in mounting medium containing the counterstain propidium iodide (2.5 μg/ml) and visualized using a fluorescent microscope. At least 500 cells/field were scored in a blinded fashion to determine the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells. Four fields per slide were used, and six independent slides were used for the final result. For annexin V assay (40Span L.F. Pennings A.H. Vierwinden G. Boezeman J.B. Raymakers R.A. de Witte T. Cytometry. 2002; 47: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the cells were lifted off the plate using trypsin-EDTA. After washing, the cells were incubated with a label containing annexin V linked to FITC. FITC-positive cells/propidium iodide cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Insulin Secretion—Cells (5 × 105 cells/well, 24-well plate) were seeded and cultured regularly for 2 days. The cells were preincubated for 30 min in HEPES-balanced Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (119 mm NaCl, 4.74 mm KCl, 2.54 mm CaCl2, 1.19 mm MgCl2, 1.19 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.5% BSA with 5 mm glucose and then incubated for 2 h with various concentrations of glucose or KCl. Released insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as standard. The cellular protein content or DNA content was also used to normalize the amount of insulin secretion. Measurement of Insulin Content—Cells (5 × 105 cells/well, 24-well plate) were seeded and grown overnight. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and extracted with acid ethanol (15 mm/liter HCl, 75% ethanol) for 18 h at 4 °C. After clarification of the extracts by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, the insulin concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay with rat insulin as a standard. Measurement of NAD(P)H Production—NAD(P)H autofluorescence was measured essentially as described previously (41Johnson J.D. Ahmed N.T. Luciani D.S. Han Z. Tran H. Fujita J. Misler S. Edlund H.

https://openalex.org/W2091911547,"Hypoxia is known to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Because reduced glutathione (GSH) is compartmentalized in cytosol and mitochondria, we examined the specific role of mitochondrial GSH (mGSH) in the survival of hepatocytes during hypoxia (5% O2). 5% O2 stimulated ROS in HepG2 cells and cultured rat hepatocytes. Mitochondrial complex I and II inhibitors prevented this effect, whereas inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis with Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride or the peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid did not. Depletion of GSH stores in both cytosol and mitochondria enhanced the susceptibility of HepG2 cells or primary rat hepatocytes to 5% O2 exposure. However, this sensitization was abrogated by preventing mitochondrial ROS generation by complex I and II inhibition. Moreover, selective mGSH depletion by (R,S)-3-hydroxy-4-pentenoate that spared cytosol GSH levels sensitized rat hepatocytes to hypoxia because of enhanced ROS generation. GSH restoration by GSH ethyl ester or by blocking mitochondrial electron flow at complex I and II rescued (R,S)-3-hydroxy-4-pentenoate-treated hepatocytes to hypoxia-induced cell death. Thus, mGSH controls the survival of hepatocytes during hypoxia through the regulation of mitochondrial generation of oxidative stress.

Thus, mGSH controls the survival of hepatocytes during hypoxia through the regulation of mitochondrial generation of oxidative stress. In conditions of limited O2 supply cells adapt and survive because of the existence of specific sensors that allow them to acclimate to the deprivation of oxygen and to recover from ischemic conditions. One of the best characterized responses to hypoxia is the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; GSH, reduced glutathione; mGSH, mitochondrial GSH; ROS, reactive oxygen species; HP, (R,S)-3-hydroxy-4-pentenoate; GSHEE, GSH ethyl ester; BSO, buthionine-l-sulfoximine; DEM, diethylmaleate; TTFA, thenoyltrifluoroacetone; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; DCF, 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescin; NO, nitric oxide; l-NAME, Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride; MnTBAP, [Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride. a transcription factor that is central for the cellular adaptation to oxygen limitation as it is known to up-regulate genes involved in angiogenesis and glycolysis (1Semenza G.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). HIF is a heterodimer comprising an O2-regulated α subunit (HIF1α) and a constitutively expressed β subunit (2Wenger R.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 3Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar, 4Safran M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The O2-dependent regulation of HIF1α occurs at the level of protein stability. In normoxia, HIF1α is targeted for degradation through the hydroxylation of specific proline residues by a family of O2- and oxoglutarate-dependent prolyl hydroxylases (5Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar, 6Bruick R. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). At low O2 tension, prolyl hydroxylase activity is inhibited, resulting in HIF1α protein accumulation. In addition, another well recognized response to hypoxia is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Moreover, the mitochondrial ROS stimulation by hypoxia contributed to the HIF1α stabilization and subsequent HIF1α-dependent gene expression and to the enhanced DNA binding of NF-κB by a redox-dependent mechanism (7Chandel N.S.

However, in conditions in which reoxygenation ensues oxygen deprivation (e.g. ischemia/reperfusion), the ROS stimulation then arises from both mitochondrial and extramitochondrial sources (10Jaeschke H. Mitchell J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). GSH is a major and versatile cellular antioxidant that is found mainly in cytosol where it is synthesized from its constituent amino acids and in mitochondria where it plays a key protective role against oxidant-induced cell death (11Fernandez-Checa J.C.

Commun. 2003; 304: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because of its antioxidant function hypoxia would be expected to reduce intracellular GSH stores. For instance, recent findings reported a reduction in cellular GSH in hypoxic human embryonic kidney 293 and Hep3B cells that required mitochondrial generation of ROS (13Mansfield K.D. Simon Celeste M Keith S. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 97: 1358-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous studies reported the decrease of hepatocellular GSH stores by hypoxia through various mechanisms ranging from enhanced GSH efflux to impaired synthesis (14Strubelt O. Younes M. Li Y. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 75: 280-284Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Rodriguez E.N. Mato J.M.

Furthermore, carbon monoxide has been reported to decrease the GSH/GSSG in rat brain mitochondria (18Zhang J. Piantadosi C. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, although the regulation of intracellular GSH levels by hypoxia is known (13Mansfield K.D. Simon Celeste M Keith S. J.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the consequences of mGSH depletion during hypoxia on the regulation of ROS generation and survival of hepatocytes. Although the abrogation of mitochondrial ROS production rescued HepG2 cells or primary rat hepatocytes from hypoxia-induced cell death despite GSH depletion in both cytosol and mitochondria, using (R,S)-3-hydroxy-4-pentenoate (HP), which is transformed in the mitochondria of hepatocytes into a Michael acceptor resulting in selective mGSH depletion with the sparing of cytosol GSH (19Shan X.

Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We provide evidence for a critical role of mGSH in determining the susceptibility of hepatocytes to hypoxia through control of mitochondrial oxidative stress. Reagents and Antibodies—GSH, GSH ethyl ester (GSHEE), buthionine-l-sulfoximine (BSO), diethylmaleate (DEM), antimycin A, rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), diphenyleneiodonium, cyclosporin A, sodium orthovanadate, sucrose, and Igepal CA-360 were obtained from Sigma. Human recombinant TNF-α (44 units/ng of protein) was from Promega, ATP and dithiothreitol were purchased from Roche Applied Science. 2′-7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) and genistein were from Calbiochem. Cell Culture and Incubation—The human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, Wilts, UK). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose levels, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Rat hepatocytes were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats (250 g) upon collagenase perfusion and were cultured as described previously (20Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Calvo M. Enrich C.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 21% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide (referred to as normoxic conditions). Hypoxic conditions were attained by exposure to 2 or 5% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide in a humidified incubator (Forma Scientific) in sealed flasks for several periods of time (up to 24 h for rat hepatocytes or 72 h for HepG2 cells). In some instances hypoxic cells were exposed to inhibitors of mitochondrial electron flow, rotenone (complex I), TTFA (complex II), antimycin A (complex III), diphenyleneiodonium, or GSH depletors, DEM and BSO, in the last 4–8 h of the period of exposure to 5% O2. In control experiments we verified that the instantaneous opening of flasks during hypoxia did not result in ROS stimulation or GSH depletion with respect to hypoxic unperturbed flasks. Mitochondria Isolation—Rat hepatocytes or HepG2 cells were fractionated into cytosol or mitochondria upon digitonin permeabilization of the plasma membrane as described previously (21Colell A.

Cultured rat hepatocytes were exposed to 1 mm HP for 5 min, washed thoroughly, and then fractionated by digitonin into cytosol and mitochondria, and GSH content was determined in either fraction as described above (21Colell A.

Preparation of Cytosolic and Nuclear Fractions and Electromobility Shift Assays—Nuclear and cytosolic extracts of HepG2 cells were prepared by lysing cells with Igepal CA-630 followed by differential centrifugation as described before (24Garcia-Ruiz C.

Cytotoxicity Assessment—Cytotoxicity was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described (26Mari M. Bai J. Cederbaum A.I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or through the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the medium. Viability is expressed as the LDH activity in medium, defined as the percentage of total intracellular LDH activity determined by the lysing of cells with 5% Triton-X100. The viability measurement was verified by trypan blue exclusion method. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Necrosis and apoptosis were evaluated using an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA). Briefly, after treatment, cells were collected, washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in binding buffer at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml. Fluorescein-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide were added to the cells, and the samples were incubated for 15 min before being analyzed with FACScan (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson). Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate generated signals were detected with a fluorescein isothiocyanate signal detector (FL1). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses of mean values for multiple comparisons were made by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Fisher's test. Hypoxia Stimulates Mitochondrial ROS Generation in HepG2 Cells and Rat Hepatocytes—Although the stimulation of ROS during hypoxia predominantly from mitochondria has been already described, we used this paradigm to specifically address the role of mGSH in the survival of hepatocytes to hypoxia. Furthermore, because previous findings showed a differential tolerance between hepatoma cells and primary hepatocytes to anoxia (27Wissemann D.H. Anundi I. Lauchart W. Viebahn R. Groot H. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we compared the ROS stimulation and survival of HepG2 cells and rat hepatocytes cultured under 2% and 5% O2. First we validated the source of ROS generated by hypoxia in hepatocytes. As seen, hypoxia stimulated a ROS generation in both HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes with respect to normoxic incubation in a time-dependent fashion that increased with the severity of oxygen deprivation (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, primary rat hepatocytes were more sensitive to hypoxia than HepG2 cells as reflected by the ROS stimulation and loss of survival observed at 2% O2 exposure (Fig. 1, C and D). Moreover, because previous studies demonstrated that the predominant source of ROS during hypoxia was the mitochondrial electron transport chain (7Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E.

Physiol. 2004; 97: 1358-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of inhibition of mitochondrial electron flow at distinct respiratory complexes on the stimulation of ROS in both cell types during 5% O2 exposure rather than 2% O2 as this was lethal for rat hepatocytes. Rotenone, a complex I inhibitor, or TTFA, a complex II blocker, decreased ROS formation in a similar fashion and their combination suppressed the stimulation of ROS by 5% O2 in both HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes (Fig. 1, E and F). Furthermore diphenyleneiodonium, which blocks flavin-linked enzymes including respiratory complex I (28Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), reduced the generation of ROS in hypoxic cells, whereas antimycin A, which blocks electron flow at the Q cycle within complex III, enhanced ROS formation caused by 5% O2 (Fig. 1E), consistent with previous findings (8Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Because it was recently reported that rat liver mitochondria generated NO contributing to hypoxia-mediated oxidative stress (29Schild L. Reinheckel T. Reiser M. Horn T.F.W. Wolf G. Augustin W. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2194-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of l-NAME or uric acid, a peroxynitrite scavenger (30Walford G.A Moussignac R.L. Scribner A.W. Loscalzo J. Leopold J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4425-4432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), on the stimulation of ROS, as DCF fluorescence is also indicative of peroxynitrite (31Crow J.P. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). l-NAME failed to prevent ROS stimulation by 5% O2 in primary hepatocytes and uric acid did not prevent the ROS stimulation caused by 5% O2. In contrast, MnTBAP, a superoxide anion scavenger, abrogated ROS generation during hypoxia (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, allopurinol (200 μm), a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, did not prevent the ROS stimulation caused by 5% O2 (not shown). Thus, these findings established that 5% O2 causes a burst of superoxide anion generated mainly from the mitochondria in both HepG2 cells or rat hepatocytes and that hepatoma HepG2 cells appear more resistant than primary cells to the oxidative stress induced by hypoxia. Moreover, we observed increased nuclear levels of HIF1α and enhanced DNA binding of NF-κB in HepG2 or primary hepatocytes subjected to 5% O2 incubation by ROS-dependent and independent mechanisms (not shown) thus further validating published observations (7Chandel N.S.

Initially we verified that, consistent with the effect on ROS generation, 5% O2 depleted GSH in both cytosol and mitochondrial compartments of HepG2 cells (Fig. 2A). However, when cells were incubated with DEM (an α-β unsaturated carbonyl electrophile, which is conjugated with GSH by GSH S-transferases) during the hypoxic period followed by BSO (a potent and specific inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase) to prevent any potential GSH recovery caused by the rapid induction of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase by DEM (32Sekhar K.R. Long M. Long J. Xu Z.Q. Summar M.L. Freeman M.L. Radiat Res. 1997; 147: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), GSH levels in either compartment were severely depleted compared with the levels found in normoxic or hypoxic untreated cells (Fig. 2A). Although this approach caused a significant increase in ROS formation (Fig. 2B), the survival of normoxic cells did not decrease (Fig. 2C). However, when this strategy was used during the exposure of cells to 5% O2 this translated into enhanced ROS formation and a significant loss of viability (Fig. 2, B and C). The role of GSH in the control of cell survival was further verified by treatment of cells with GSHEE during exposure of cells to 5% O2 that caused the replenishment of GSH stores in both cytosol and mitochondria (Fig. 2A). GSHEE attenuated ROS generation and protected DEM plus BSO-treated HepG2 cells from 5% O2-induced cell death (Fig. 2, B and C). In addition, rotenone plus TTFA diminished the enhanced ROS generation in DEM plus BSO-treated HepG2 cells, thus protecting them from 5% O2-induced cell death (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition to these results in HepG2 cells, similar findings were observed with primary rat hepatocytes. DEM plus BSO depleted GSH in both cytosol and mitochondrial compartments, which enhanced the susceptibility of hepatocytes to hypoxia (Fig. 3). Moreover, rotenone plus TTFA, which decreased ROS generation during hypoxia (Fig. 1F), protected rat hepatocytes against hypoxia-mediated cell death (Fig. 3). Furthermore, GSH replenishment with GSHEE protected DEM plus BSO-treated rat hepatocytes from 5% O2-induced cell death (Fig. 3). Using flow cytometry we evaluated the percentage of propidium iodide- and/or annexin V-positive HepG2 cell populations exposed to 5% O2. Most cells subjected to 5% O2 were annexin V- and propidium iodide-negative (Fig. 4A). However, DEM plus BSO treatment increased the population of cells with enhanced propidium iodide uptake and annexin V externalization, as well as those positive for both markers (Fig. 4, B and C). Moreover, consistent with the findings on cell survival (Fig. 2), rotenone plus TTFA decreased the population of DEM plus BSO-treated HepG2 cells positive for propidium iodide uptake and annexin V externalization (Fig. 4, D compared with C). Thus, GSH depletion sensitizes HepG2 cells to 5% O2-induced necrotic and apoptotic death. Selective mGSH Depletion Determines the Survival of Rat Hepatocytes to 5% O2—To examine specifically the role of mGSH on the sensitivity of hepatocytes to hypoxia, we selectively depleted the mitochondrial pool of GSH by HP during the exposure of rat hepatocytes to 5% O2. HP is transformed in mitochondria into a Michael acceptor (α-β unsaturated carbonyl) that reacts with GSH in the matrix resulting in its depletion (19Shan X. Jones D.P Hashmi M. Anders M.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Garcia-Ruiz C."
https://openalex.org/W2029134404,"The protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is activated when cells are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). It has been assumed that ATM is specifically activated by the few induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), although little direct evidence for this assumption has been presented. DSBs constitute only a few percent of the IR-induced DNA damage, whereas the more frequent single strand DNA breaks (SSBs) and base damage account for over 98% of the overall DNA damage. It is therefore unclear whether DSBs are the only IR-induced DNA lesions that activate ATM. To test directly whether or not DSBs are responsible for ATM activation, we exposed cells to drugs and radiation that produce different numbers of DSBs and SSBs. We determined the resulting ATM activation by measuring the amount of phosphorylated Chk2 and the numbers of SSBs and DSBs in the same cells after short incubation periods. We found a strong correlation between the number of DSBs and ATM activation but no correlation with the number of SSBs. In fact, hydrogen peroxide, which, similar to IR, induces DNA damage through hydroxyl radicals but fails to induce DSBs, did not activate ATM. In contrast, we found that calicheamicin-induced strand breaks activated ATM more efficiently than IR and that ATM activation correlated with the relative DSB induction by these agents. Our data indicate that ATM is specifically activated by IR-induced DSBs, with little or no contribution from SSBs and other types of DNA damage. These findings have implications for how ATM might recognize DSBs in cells. The protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is activated when cells are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). It has been assumed that ATM is specifically activated by the few induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), although little direct evidence for this assumption has been presented. DSBs constitute only a few percent of the IR-induced DNA damage, whereas the more frequent single strand DNA breaks (SSBs) and base damage account for over 98% of the overall DNA damage. It is therefore unclear whether DSBs are the only IR-induced DNA lesions that activate ATM. To test directly whether or not DSBs are responsible for ATM activation, we exposed cells to drugs and radiation that produce different numbers of DSBs and SSBs. We determined the resulting ATM activation by measuring the amount of phosphorylated Chk2 and the numbers of SSBs and DSBs in the same cells after short incubation periods. We found a strong correlation between the number of DSBs and ATM activation but no correlation with the number of SSBs. In fact, hydrogen peroxide, which, similar to IR, induces DNA damage through hydroxyl radicals but fails to induce DSBs, did not activate ATM. In contrast, we found that calicheamicin-induced strand breaks activated ATM more efficiently than IR and that ATM activation correlated with the relative DSB induction by these agents. Our data indicate that ATM is specifically activated by IR-induced DSBs, with little or no contribution from SSBs and other types of DNA damage. These findings have implications for how ATM might recognize DSBs in cells. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, DNA double strand break; SSB, single strand break; TSB, total strand break (DSB+SSB); IR, ionizing radiation; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK; AT, ataxia telangiectasia; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAR, poly(ADP-ribose); PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; FAR, fraction of activity released; CLM, calicheamicin γ1; MRN complex, Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1. are the most toxic form of DNA damage, because a single unrepaired DSB can lead to losses of large pieces of DNA during mitosis. Therefore, cells have evolved effective pathways for the repair and detection of DSBs (reviewed in Ref. 1Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). DSBs are generated by ionizing radiation (IR) and drugs that produce radicals or interfere with topoisomerase II function. It has been shown for IR that the few DSBs that are produced correlate closely to the amount of cell death that occurs, whereas the 100-fold more abundant single strand DNA breaks (SSBs) and base damage are probably of minor importance in relation to the cytotoxic effect (2Tounekti O. Kenani A. Foray N. Orlowski S. Mir L.M. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 84: 1272-1279Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). ATM is a protein serine/threonine kinase activated in cells exposed to IR (3Canman C.E. Lim D-S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D.

Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). ATM activation results in rapid induction of numerous cell responses, which leads to activation of cell cycle checkpoints (1Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Cells without ATM function show a profound defective response to IR and are therefore radiosensitive. They are able to repair most, but not all, IR-induced DNA damage (6Kuhne M. Riballo E. Rief N. Rothkamm K. Jeggo P.A. Lobrich M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The ATM gene is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia (7Savitsky K. Sfez S. Tagle D. Ziv Y. Sartiel A. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), a pleiotropic recessive human disorder characterized by cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, cancer predisposition, and extreme radiosensitivity (reviewed in Refs. 8Barzilai A.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). ATM phosphorylates and controls several signaling pathways that are activated by IR. Important examples are the p53 protein, which mediates the G1/S checkpoint, and Chk2, which activates the G2/M checkpoint by inhibiting the CDC25 phosphatase (1Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 10Kurz E.U. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Among the ATM substrates involved in DNA damage recognition are serine 139 of histone 2AX (H2AX) (11Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar), threonine 68 of Chk2 (12Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S. Proc. Natl.

ATM also phosphorylates and regulates several proteins involved in the response to IR, the functions of which are still unknown. Examples are the Brca1 and Nbs1, proteins mutated in the human cancer disorders, hereditary breast cancer, and AT-like disorder (reviewed in Ref. 1Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). A recent report indicates that ATM is an inactive multimer in cells. In response to IR, ATM phosphorylates itself to become an active monomer capable of phosphorylating downstream targets, such as p53 (16Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). However, purified ATM and ATM in crude cell extract do not change their molecular weight in response to phosphorylation, which indicates that the multimeric form could be unstable or dependent on, as yet, unknown factors inside the cell (17Goodarzi A.A. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ATM activation in response to IR is dependent on the function of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1, which form a functional complex with helicase and nuclease activities (MRN complex) (18Lavin M.F. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1515-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Uziel T. Lerenthal Y. Moyal L. Andegeko Y. Mittelman L. Shiloh Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Mre11 can interact with ATM in a purified system and stimulate ATM kinase activity (20Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2004; 304: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). However, the kinase activity observed in preparations of ATM alone or together with the MRN complex is not specifically stimulated by DNA ends (17Goodarzi A.A. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Lee J.H. Paull T.T. Science. 2004; 304: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 21Chan D.W. Son S-C. Block W. Ye R. Khanna K.K. Wold M.S. Douglas P. Goodarzi A.A. Pelley J. Taya Y. Lavin M.F. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7803-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition, several reports indicate that purified ATM binds poorly to DNA (17Goodarzi A.A. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Chan D.W. Son S-C. Block W. Ye R. Khanna K.K. Wold M.S. Douglas P. Goodarzi A.A. Pelley J. Taya Y.

Despite the profound importance of ATM in cellular response to IR, we still do not know what type of DNA damage is recognized by ATM. It has been assumed that ATM is activated by the few DSBs induced by IR or topoisomerase II toxins. However, there is no direct data indicating that DSBs are the only initiating event. One problem is that the majority of IR-induced DNA damage are SSBs and base damage. Only 1–2% of the DNA damage is DSBs. For topoisomerase II toxins, a recent report indicates that most of the lesions produced by these drugs are topoisomerase II-linked SSBs (22Bromberg K.D. Burgin A.B. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7406-7412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This implies the possibility that ATM is also capable of detecting other types of DNA damage, such as base damage induced by UV light (23Zhang Y. Ma W.Y. Kaji A. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 124-131Google Scholar, 24Zhang Y. Cho Y.Y. Petersen B.L. Bode A.M. Zhu F. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12650-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and hexavalent chromium compounds that fail to induce quantifiable numbers of DSBs (25Ha L. Ceryak S. Patierno S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17885-17894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, single strand oligonucleotides have been shown to induce ATM/p53-dependent apoptosis (26Nur-E-Kamal A. Li T.-K. Zhang A. Qi H. Hars E.S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12475-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that the local chromatin relaxation that occurs around a DSB is the activation signal for ATM rather than the actual DSB (16Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). In favor of the chromatin relaxation model, it has been shown that ATM can be activated by a series of compounds and hypotonic treatments that induce chromatin alteration in the apparent absence of DNA damage (16Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). One potential problem with the chromatin relaxation model is that SSBs would possibly be able to activate ATM, because SSBs and DSBs are both capable of relaxing supercoiled DNA. In fact, by measuring psoralen intercalation efficiency, it has been shown that IR-induced SSBs effectively abolish chromatin supercoiling in mammalian cells (27Ljungman M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6055-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Ljungman M. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1782-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SSBs should therefore be able to activate ATM to some extent. To test directly whether or not ATM is activated specifically by DSBs, we induced strand breaks in cellular DNA with compounds and radiation that produce different numbers of DSBs and SSBs. We measured ATM activation and the number of SSBs and DSBs in the treated cells after short incubation periods to prevent secondary events. We found that ATM is not activated at all in response to SSBs, even at numbers that would be able to fully relax chromatin supercoiling. In addition, we also found that the number of DSBs correlates closely with the ATM activity in the cells, whereas no correlation was found with the number of SSBs. Our data indicate that ATM is directly activated by the few DSBs that are introduced by IR. Cells and Reagents—Calicheamicin γ1 (CLM) was a generous gift from Prof. George Ellestad (Wyeth-Ayers Research). The drug was dissolved at 2 mm in Me2SO and stored at -70 °C. Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized normal (catalog number GM02254) and AT (catalog number GM01526) human lymphoblast cultures were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research. All lymphoblast cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 nm glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Measurement of ATM Activation—H2AX phosphorylation was measured in cells treated with the DNA-damaging agents for 15 min at 37 °C (as indicated in Fig. 4C). After washing with cold PBS, the cells were suspended in cell lysis buffer, and H2AX phosphorylation was measured as described previously (29Elmroth K. Nygren J. Martensson S. Ismail I.H. Hammarsten O. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Chk2, SMC1, and ATM autophosphorylation were measured in human lymphoblast cells treated for 15 min at 37 °C with the indicated drugs (see Fig. 4). The cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml antipain and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min on ice. The cell extract was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 revolutions/min for 10 min at 4 °C and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), the membranes were blocked with Blotto (5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) and incubated with a polyclonal antibody specific to Chk2 phosphorylated at Thr-68 (Cell Signaling Technology), SMC1 phosphorylated at Ser-957 (Bethyl Laboratories), or ATM phosphorylated at Ser-1981 (Rockland). After incubation with a secondary antibody, the membranes were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal® West Dura extended duration substrate, Pierce). After stripping with 50 mm glycine, pH 2.3, for 30 min, the membranes were blocked and reprobed with a Ku70 antibody (Novagene) to show equal loading. Measurement of Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) Polymerase (PARP) Activation in Cells—For detection of PAR, cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and treated on ice with different concentrations of H2O2, as indicated in Fig. 5B. After treatment, the cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The cell extracts were then prepared by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) to each sample. The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. To detect PAR bound to proteins, the membrane was probed with a monoclonal antibody to PAR (1:500 dilution; Trevigen) and peroxidase-labeled goat antibody to mouse IgG (Sigma). The bands were quantified with ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad) using the Quantity One software. Fraction of Activity Released (FAR) Assay—The number of DSBs in cells treated with IR, CLM, or H2O2 were monitored with the FAR assay (29Elmroth K. Nygren J. Martensson S. Ismail I.H. Hammarsten O. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After exposure to drugs or radiation, the cells were kept on ice at all times, and all solutions added to the cells were ice-cold. The cells were centrifuged, resuspended in PBS supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml sheared herring sperm DNA and 56 mm β-mercaptoethanol to inactivate excess CLM, and incubated on ice for 5 min. The cells were then washed with PBS, and 150,000 cells were mixed with melted agarose (1.25% type VII in PBS with 5 mm EDTA) and transferred to a plug mold. The cells in the plug were then lysed at 4 °C for a minimum of 24 h in lysis buffer (25 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, 0.5% SDS, 3 mg/ml proteinase K added just prior to lysis). Longer incubation times did not alter the quality of the data. The cells were then resolved using agarose gel electrophoresis (0.7%) in 1× TAE (0.04 m Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) at 4 °C for 17 h at 2 V/cm. The relative amount of cellular DNA migrating into the gel (FAR) was quantified using laser scanning equipment (Typhoon 9200 Variable Mode Imager, ImageQuant 5.2) to calculate the number of DSBs. Comet Assay—The comet assay was performed as described previously (29Elmroth K. Nygren J. Martensson S. Ismail I.H. Hammarsten O. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 5,000–10,000 cells were mixed with 150 μl of 0.75% low melting agarose (type VII, Sigma) kept at 37 °C. The agarose-cell suspension was spread onto prechilled gel bond film (Cambrex Bio Science). The preparations were left on a chilled plate for 5 min before lysis (0.03 m NaOH, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% N-lauryl sarcosine) for 1 h and thereafter equilibrated (0.03 m NaOH, 2 mm EDTA) for 1 h. Electrophoresis of the agarose-imbedded cells was run at 0.67 V/cm for 15 min in the same solution. The film was then neutralized in 0.4 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The film was fixed in absolute ethanol for 2 h and allowed to dry. After staining the film with SybrGold (Molecular Probes) for 5 min, it was rinsed briefly in deionized water. Analysis of the DNA that migrated from the nuclei, the tail moment, was done using an Olympus fluorescence microscope aided by the Kinetic Imaging Komet II system. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were concentrated by centrifugation onto microscopic slides (cytospin), fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde supplemented with 20% sucrose for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The fixed cells were blocked for 1 h in 10% (v/v) serum in PBS at 37 °C and rinsed with PBS. Mouse monoclonal anti-PAR antibody (Trevigen) was diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer and incubated with the cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Alexa Fluor™ 594 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was diluted 1:4000 and incubated with the cells for 1 h at 37 °C, protected from light. The cells were counterstained with 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in Prolong® Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Confocal fluorescence images were captured using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Inc.). Images were obtained in 8-bit mode. The fluorescence intensities were placed within the linear range of the detector by setting the amplifier offset to zero. The detector gain was adjusted so that the peak intensities never reached saturation levels. Measurement of ATM Kinase Activity—To be able to specifically measure ATM kinase activity in cells, we screened several commercially available phosphospecific antibodies against known ATM substrates using immunoblot. We noted that all ATM substrates were phosphorylated in a DNA damage-dependent manner in AT cells (Fig. 1A), indicating that other kinases can be substituted for ATM (30Stiff T. O'Driscoll M. Rief N. Iwabuchi K. Lobrich M. Jeggo P.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2390-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). However, at low DNA damage levels and at short times after induction of DNA damage, Chk2, SMC1, and H2AX were almost exclusively phosphorylated in normal B cells. We also compared the relative strengths of the signals from the ATM substrates in immunoblot analysis. We found that with a 15-min incubation period, Chk2 phosphorylation could be detected at 10-fold lower concentrations of the DSB-inducing drug CLM as compared with SMC1, H2AX, and ATM autophosphorylation (Fig. 1B). We therefore optimized the incubation time and DNA damage levels for the Chk2 phosphorylation in all subsequent experiments so that no phosphorylation of Chk2 was detected in AT cells, thus allowing us to specifically measure ATM activation in cells (Fig. 1C). Measurement of H 2O 2-, IR-, and CLM-induced Strand Breaks—To study the possible involvement of SSBs, DNA base damage, or chromatin relaxation in ATM kinase activation, we induced DNA strand breaks with drugs and radiation that produced different numbers of DSBs and SSBs. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induces predominantly SSBs by production of randomly distributed hydroxyl radicals (31Prise K.M. Davies S. Michael B.D. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1989; 55: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 32Cantoni O. Sestili P. Cattabeni F. Xenobiotica. 1988; 18: 1481-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 33Bradley M.O. Erickson L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 654: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). IR also induces DNA strand breaks by production of hydroxyl radicals when the photons react with water. However, because multiple hydroxyl radicals are produced in close proximity, some of the events result in DSBs. Apart from this difference, the DNA damage distribution and the chemistry of the DNA lesions produced by H2O2 and IR are very similar (33Bradley M.O. Erickson L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 654: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Massie H.R. Samis H.V. Baird M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 272: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35Lesko S.A. Drocourt J.L. Yang S.U. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5010-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CLM is an enediyne antibiotic that binds and cleaves DNA by cooperative activation of two radical centers in the molecule. Because the two radical centers become positioned close to the opposite strands in the DNA, a large proportion of the strand breaks produced are DSBs (36Lee M.D. Ellestad G.A. Borders D.B. Acc. Chem. Res. 1991; 24: 235-243Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To measure the relative number of DSBs and SSBs produced by these agents, we first exposed B cells to different concentrations of drugs and different doses of IR. Cells from each treatment were then subjected to analysis of total DNA strand breaks (TSBs = SSBs + DSBs) using the alkaline comet assay and DSBs using the FAR assay. The results showed that, although all of these agents effectively induced strand breaks as measured using the comet assay (Fig. 2), only IR and CLM were able to induce DSBs as measured using the FAR assay (Fig. 3). The cells treated with H2O2 did not show any DSBs in this assay, in agreement with previous findings (37Dahm-Daphi J. Sass C. Alberti W. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2000; 76: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To further explore this, we extended the H2O2 titration to 3 mm. At these concentrations of H2O2, all DNA migrated out from the nuclei in the comet assay, preventing any calculation of the number of TSBs. However, by extrapolating the strand breaks from measurements done at 0.2 mm and assuming a linear dose-response relationship, we concluded that over 400,000 SSBs/cell were produced at 3 mm H2O2. This number corresponds to one SSB for every 6000 bp. Despite the large number of strand breaks, no DSBs were observed in the FAR assay (Fig. 3B). From the detection limit of DSBs in the FAR assay and the TSBs produced at 3 mm H2O2, we estimated that <0.1% of all DNA strand breaks induced by H2O2 are DSBs. The percentages of DSBs were ∼30% for CLM and 5% for IR, based on our previous results (29Elmroth K. Nygren J. Martensson S. Ismail I.H. Hammarsten O. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Fig. 3DSB induction in WT cells by H2O2, CLM, and IR, measured with the FAR assay.

The amount of DNA entering the gel (the FAR value) was quantified and used to generate the graphs.

We therefore measured the phosphorylation of known ATM targets using immunoblot with phosphospecific antibodies in extracts from the same batch of cells analyzed for TSBs and DSBs. Measurements of ATM activation was done at 15 min after the addition of the drug to prevent secondary events. As a control, we also measured ATM activation in cells treated with CLM. We found that H2O2 failed to induce any detectable phosphorylation of the ATM substrates (Fig. 4). In contrast, CLM induced strongly dose-dependent phosphorylation of SMC1, ATM, H2AX, and Chk2 (Fig. 4). It was possible that the large amount of oxidative damage produced by H2O2 might result in inactivation of many processes in the cell, including ATM kinase activity. To determine whether the cells were able to respond to the SSBs induced by H2O2, we measured PAR modification of proteins in the cells after H2O2 treatment. PAR is added to the proteins by the PAR polymerases (PARPs) in response to SSBs (38Okano S. Lan L. Caldecott K.W. Mori T. Yasui A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3974-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Using immunofluorescence, we found a strong nuclear PAR response in cells treated with both 0.5 and 5 mm H2O2 (Fig. 5A). Using immunoblot with the same PAR-specific antibody, we found that H2O2 stimulated PARP activity with a linear dose-response relationship up to 1 mm, indicating that the cells were able to recognize the SSBs produced. However, at 3 mm, the linear dose-response relationship was lost. Apparently, PARP activity was partially inhibited at this concentration (Fig. 5B). We also tested whether or not ATM was inhibited by H2O2 by first introducing DSBs with a fixed concentration of CLM (1 nm). This pretreatment was done on ice to prevent any ATM activation. We then added different concentrations of H2O2 and incubated the cells at 37 °C for 15 min to allow the ATM to become activated. We found that 1 mm H2O2 reduced ATM activation by 50%, whereas concentrations below 0.3 mm did not affect the ATM activity (Fig. 5C). Similar results were obtained using IR-induced DSBs before H2O2 treatment (data not shown). The failure to observe ATM activation in response to 0.3 mm H2O2 could therefore not be attributed to ATM inhibition by H2O2. In addition, these data indicate that experiments at H2O2 concentrations >1 mm would not be informative, because ATM would be partially inactivated. We concluded that ATM was not activated by H2O2-induced DNA damage, because no DSBs were formed. ATM Activation by CLM and IR Correlates with the Number of DSBs—We then compared ATM activation after CLM- and IR-induced DNA damage. CLM is one of the most effective DSB-inducing agents known. In fact, 30% of all DNA strand breaks are DSBs. In contrast, most of the IR-induced DNA strand breaks are SSBs, and only 2–5% of the strand breaks are DSBs (29Elmroth K. Nygren J. Martensson S. Ismail I.H. Hammarsten O. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). If ATM is exclusively activated by DSBs, it is therefore expected that ATM would be activated to a higher extent by CLM-induced DNA strand breaks than by IR-induced DNA strand breaks. We therefore measured Chk2 phosphorylation in the same CLM- or IR-treated cells used for TSB and DSB determination. We found dose-dependent induction of Chk2 phosphorylation for both IR- and CLM-treated cells. In parallel experiments, no Chk2 phosphorylation was observed in AT cells, indicating that all Chk2 phosphorylation was attributable to ATM kinase activity (Fig. 6, A and B). In these experiments, we also included an extra sample from CLM-treated cells to serve as an internal control. We used this internal control to normalize Chk2 phosphorylation to be able to compare the Chk2 phosphorylation in the individual experiments (Fig. 6, A and B). We then plotted the Chk2 phosphorylation against the number of TSBs determined using the comet assay. The results showed that CLM-induced strand breaks activated ATM to a higher extent than did IR. By comparing the relative Chk2 phosphorylation in these experiments, we calculated that CLM-induced TSBs activated ATM five times better"

We have used customized oligonucleotide microarrays to interrogate simultaneously the levels of expression of splicing factors and the patterns of alternative splicing of genes involved in tumor progression. Analysis of RNAs isolated from cell lines derived from Hodgkin lymphoma tumors indicate that the relative abundance of alternatively spliced isoforms correlates with transformation and tumor grade. Changes in expression of regulators were also detected, and a subset sample was confirmed at the protein level. Ectopic expression of neuron-specific splicing regulatory proteins of the Nova family was observed in some cell lines and tumor samples, correlating with expression of a neuron-specific mRNA isoform of JNK2 kinase. This microarray design can help assess the role of alternative splicing in a variety of biological and medical problems and potentially serve as a diagnostic tool.

Early successes of this technology range from detailed genome-wide analysis of gene expression during Drosophila development to the molecular classification of lymphomas (2White K.P. Rifkin S.A.

Work in a variety of genes and organisms has led to the hypothesis that the relative expression of general splicing factors in different cell types establishes patterns of alternative splicing in multiple genes (13Smith C.W.J.

Tissue-specific regulators have also been found, e.g. the nervous system-specific proteins of the Nova family, which induce neuron-specific patterns of alternative splicing on target genes (16Jensen K.B.

Despite their heterogeneous phenotype, cDNA microarrays have revealed the expression of a characteristic set of markers regardless of their B- or T-cell origin (18Kuppers R. Klein U. Schwering I.

Mol Med. 2003; 9: 85-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) There is a need, however, for additional prognostic markers. Results obtained with our microarray design suggest that general patterns of alternative splicing, as well as expression of particular splicing regulators, can be indicative of cell transformation and tumor grade. Biological Materials—Cell lines (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% (L-540, HDML-2) or 10% (all other cell lines) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Lymph node tumor samples from lymphoma patients were purchased from BioChain (catalog number P1235161A-1, P1235161B-1). Splicing Factors Data Base—A data base of splicing factors was built from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Sequence Data base containing constitutive components of the spliceosome (snRNP 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; RT, reverse transcription. proteins and small nuclear RNAs), members of the SR and hnRNP families of splicing regulators, splicing factor kinases, and other RNA-binding proteins (see Fig. 1A). The genes encoding these proteins and RNAs were grouped by families or functions, together with their sequence information and links to orthologous genes in different species (eta.embl-heidelberg.de:8000/cgi/angela_restricted/cgimodel.py?fun=displayGroupFactorPage). Microarray Analyses—Oligonucleotide microarrays were produced using the Geniom OneR system, Febit AG, Mannheim, Germany (20Baum M. Bielau S. Rittner N. Schmid K. Eggelbusch K. Dahms M. Schlauersbach A. Tahedl H. Beier M. Guimil R. Scheffler M. Hermann C. Funk J.M. Wixmerten A. Rebscher H. Honig M. Andreae C. Buchner D. Moschel E. Glathe A. Jager E. Thom M. Greil A. Bestvater F.

Probes for bacterial genes conferring resistance to ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol and the Drosophila gene Sex-lethal were used as negative controls. Preparation of biotinylated cRNA was essentially as reported (20Baum M. Bielau S. Rittner N. Schmid K. Eggelbusch K. Dahms M. Schlauersbach A. Tahedl H. Beier M. Guimil R. Scheffler M. Hermann C. Funk J.M. Wixmerten A. Rebscher H. Honig M. Andreae C. Buchner D. Moschel E. Glathe A. Jager E. Thom M. Greil A. Bestvater F. Obermeier F. Burgmaier J. Thome K. Weichert S. Hein S. Binnewies T. Foitzik V. Muller M. Stahler C.F. Stahler P.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e151Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from cells in culture using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 5 μg of total RNA were incubated with 100 pmol of T7-T(24)-primer at 70 °C for 10 min in an 11-μl reaction. cDNA synthesis was carried out in a 20-μl reaction containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm dNTPs, 20 units of RNase OUT (Invitrogen), and 300 units of SuperScript II (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 50 °C. Second strand cDNA synthesis was carried out in a 150-μl reaction containing 40 units of DNA polymerase I, 10 units of DNA ligase, 2 units of RNase H, 200 μm dNTP mix for 2 h at 16 °C. After T4 DNA polymerase treatment, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation, T7 transcription was carried out for 6 h at 37 °C in a -μl reaction using the AMS Biotech Megascript T7 kit in the presence of 1.88 mm Biotin-11-CTP, 1.88 mm Biotin-16-UTP. The DNA template was then digested for 15 min at 37 °C with 1 unit of DNase I, and the labeled cRNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cRNA fragmentation was achieved by incubating 15 μg of cRNA in 40 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 30 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate in a total volume of 5 μl for 35 min at 94 °C. The average fragment length was 100 nucleotides. Microarrays were hybridized with 15 μg of fragmented cRNA in a final volume of 20 μl. Detection, processing of raw data including background correction, array-to-array normalization, determination of gene expression levels, and calculation of -fold change values were carried out as described (20Baum M. Bielau S. Rittner N. Schmid K. Eggelbusch K. Dahms M. Schlauersbach A. Tahedl H. Beier M. Guimil R. Scheffler M. Hermann C. Funk J.M. Wixmerten A. Rebscher H. Honig M. Andreae C. Buchner D.

BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using data from 13 perfect match/single mismatch oligonucleotide pairs (for mRNAs and exons) or 11 pairs (for splice junctions). Tiling arrays (full coverage of a sequence by oligonucleotides offset by one nucleotide) were generated for selected sequence features. At least six different RNA isolates were used per cell line to calculate median values of -fold changes (data provided as Supplementary Materials), which were categorized as up-regulation, down-regulation, or no change based on a 2-fold threshold and the request that at least 50% of the replicates showed consistent behavior, and less than 30% of the remaining data showed disparate results. Subsequent analyses (including Spearman correlation clustering, gene trees, condition trees, and analysis of variance analysis) used the Excel and Gene Spring 6.2 (Silicon Genetics) software programs. Semiquantitative RT-PCR Assays—For Nova assays, 5 μg of total cytoplasmic RNA, after treatment with RQ1 DNase (Promega), were reverse-transcribed with SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using the oligonucleotides Ex1as 5′-GTGCTGTTGGGAACTATAATCTTTAC-3′ for Nova-1 or Nova-2–3(4) and 5′-TTGGGGACGATCAGCTTGG-3′ for Nova-2. PCR was carried out using primers Exlas and Ri28 (5′-CGCCGGACTCGCGGAAAAG-3′) to amplify a 481-bp fragment of Nova-1 mRNA or primers Nova-2–5(1) (5′-CAAGAGGCCCCTCGAAACG-3′) and Nova-2–3(4) to amplify a 388-bp fragment of Nova-2 mRNA. The conditions used for amplification were 95 °C 5′ and 27 cycles of 95 °C 30 s, 57 °C 30 s, 72 °C, 1 min for Nova-1 and identical conditions except for an annealing temperature of 60 °C for Nova-2. For JNK2 assays, reverse transcription was carried out using 2 μg of cytoplasmic total RNA (treated with RQ1 DNase, Promega) with primers JNK2 3′-1, 5′-ACTGCTGCATCTGAAGGC-3′, or JNK2 3′-2, 5′-TTACTGCTGCATCTGTGC-3′, and murine mammary tumor virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR amplification was carried out using JNK2 3′-1 or JNK2 3′-2 primers in combination with primers specific for the alternative exons 6b, 5′-GAGAGCTGGTGAAAGGTT-3′, and 6a, 5′-GAAATGGTCCTCCATAAAG-3′, under the following conditions: 95 °C 5′ and 27 cycles of 95 °C, 1 min, 56 °C, 1 min, 72 °C, 1 min. RNA titration assays showed that under these conditions, amplification was linear and able to detect 2-fold differences in mRNA amounts (not shown). Values obtained with various combinations of oligonucleotides in five different RT-PCR experiments from two independent RNA isolates were used to generate the data of Fig. 5D. Western Blot—Total protein extracts were fractionated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotting chamber. Membranes were incubated with 1× phosphate-buffered saline-0.1% Tween supplemented with 5% nonfat milk and antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antihuman Nova-1/3000; rabbit polyclonal antihuman PSF, 1/5000 (a gift from J. Patton, Vanderbilt University); rabbit polyclonal antihuman SAP155 1/300 (a gift from R. Reed, Harvard Medical School); monoclonal antihuman U2AF65, 1/1000; monoclonal antihuman β-tubulin, 1/5000 (Sigma). Antibody reactivity was detected by chemiluminescence (Western Lighting ™, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Experimental Design—Based on previous optimization efforts (22Relógio A. Schwager C. Richter A. Ansorge W. Valcarcel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), 25-mer oligonucleotides were designed to analyze the expression of 86 mRNAs encoding proteins implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing (Fig. 1A). Each mRNA was analyzed with 13 pairs of oligonucleotides, each pair containing one perfect match and a mismatch control with a single transversion at position 13. To detect ∼100 splicing events, mostly involving alternative cassette exons, occurring in genes related to cell signaling, proliferation, adhesion, and apoptosis (Fig. 1A), 13 oligonucleotide pairs corresponding to constitutive or alternative exons, as well as 11 oligonucleotide pairs spanning alternative splice junctions, were selected (Fig. 1B). Microarrays were generated by light-activated in situ synthesis of the selected oligonucleotides (20Baum M. Bielau S. Rittner N. Schmid K. Eggelbusch K. Dahms M. Schlauersbach A. Tahedl H. Beier M. Guimil R. Scheffler M. Hermann C. Funk J.M. Wixmerten A. Rebscher H. Honig M. Andreae C. Buchner D. Moschel E. Glathe A. Jager E. Thom M. Greil A. Bestvater F. Obermeier F. Burgmaier J. Thome K. Weichert S. Hein S. Binnewies T. Foitzik V. Muller M. Stahler C.F. Stahler P.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e151Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from cell lines derived from Hodgkin lymphoma tumors at stages IIIb (HD-MY-Z), IV (HDML-2), or IVb (L-540) and from a non-tumor B cell line (LCL-H0) as a reference. After reverse transcription using an oligo(dT)-T7 RNA polymerase promoter primer and second strand synthesis, biotin-labeled cRNAs were generated by T7 transcription and hybridized to the microarrays. Hybridizations corresponding to at least six independent RNA isolates were carried out for each of the cell lines analyzed, resulting in ∼70 independent measurements per cell line and sequence feature analyzed. -Fold changes between Hodgkin and reference cell lines for each sequence feature and their statistical analyses are provided as Supplementary Data. The ratios between alternative and constitutive exons and between the relevant splice junctions represent independent sources of information for analyzing the relative use of alternative splice sites. Expression of Alternative mRNA Isoforms—The ability of the microarrays to detect different mRNA isoforms was first evaluated by analyzing the expression of p16 and p14ARF mRNAs, which encode pivotal regulators of the tumor suppressors p53 and Rb (23Sherr C.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). p16 and p14ARF mRNAs are generated from a single locus through alternative sites of transcription initiation and the use of alternative first exons. It was previously reported (24Sturzenhofecker B. Schlott T. Quentin T. Kube D. Jung W. Trumper L. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2003; 44: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that expression of p16 is increased in HDML-2 cells, expression of p14ARF is increased in HD-MY-Z cells, and expression of either gene is undetectable in L-540 cells. The microarray results were fully consistent with these previous observations (Fig. 2A), indicating that our microarray design is able to distinguish between the expression of alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms. Analysis of ∼100 splicing events documented 20–30% changes in splicing between the different Hodgkin cell lines and the non-tumor B cell line, which showed various levels of concordance among the different tumor lines. This is illustrated in Fig. 2B by the complex pattern of alternative splicing of the gene encoding the cell adhesion molecule CD44, which has been implicated in tumor metastasis (25Gunthert U. Hofmann M. Rudy W. Reber S. Zoller M. Haussmann I. Matzku S. Wenzel A. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1991; 65: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Unsupervised clustering analysis of data obtained from 16 RNA preparations corresponding to four independent RNA isolates/cell line showed appropriate grouping of the samples according to the cell line and closer clustering of cell lines derived from grade IV tumors versus grade III and non-tumor B cell lines (Fig. 3). Table I summarizes the statistical analysis of the data. Taken together, the results indicate that the analysis of splicing patterns allows us to distinguish Hodgkin cell lines from the non-tumor B cell line and to group together cell lines derived from the same tumor grade.Table IStatistical analysis of -fold changes in splicing in Hodgkin cell lines For each pair of Hodgkin lines, the fold differences in the use of exon/exon junctions between each cell line and the reference B cell line are compared.

These include members of the hnRNP and SR protein families, snRNP components such as SAP155, SAP62, and PSF, splicing co-activators such as SRm 160 and 300, and neuron-specific splicing regulators such as Nova-1 and -2. A subset sample of these changes was verified at the protein level (Figs. 4 and 5). 90% of the microarray data that were tested at the RNA and/or protein level were consistent with the results obtained by independent experiments and/or literature reports. Not unexpectedly, microarray and other expression data were not always comparable. For example, microarray data detected only a putative increase in expression of the U5-associated factor PSF (ptbasf in the microarray) in HD-MY-Z cells, whereas increases were experimentally observed in the three Hodgkin cell lines (Fig. 4C).Table IIChanges in observed in the expression of splicing factors in Hodgkin cell lines Fold change refers to the fold difference in mRNA abundance between Hodgkin cell lines and the reference cell line.

Posner J.B. Darnell R.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 657-672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and the presence of antibodies in serum correlates with the development of paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia, a motor control disorder (27Darnell R.B. Arch. Neurol. 2004; 61: 30-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A related protein, Nova-2, is also recognized by the sera of paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia patients and is normally expressed in the central nervous system with a distribution distinct from that of Nova-1 (28Yang Y.Y. Yin G.L. Darnell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13254-13259Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The microarray data indicated expression of Nova mRNAs in the grade III HD-MY-Z cell line and expression of Nova-2 in grade IV HDML-2 cells (Table II). These patterns of expression were confirmed at the transcript and protein level (Fig. 5, A and B). Analysis of other Hodgkin cell lines and tumor samples confirmed expression of Nova-2 in another grade IV cell line and in malignant Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumors (Fig. 5, B and C). Recent results have identified pre-mRNAs containing Nova-2 binding sites, the alternative splicing of which was altered in Nova-2 knock-out mice (17Ule J. Jensen K.B. Ruggiu M. Mele A. Ule A. Darnell R.B. Science. 2003; 302: 1212-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). One of these, the JNK2 pre-mRNA, is alternatively spliced to generate mRNA isoforms that encode kinases that play key roles in cell signaling, proliferation, and apoptosis and that have different affinities for their transcription factor substrates (29Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). A prediction of our results is that expression of Nova-2 in the HDML-2 cell line could alter JNK2 alternative splicing. The results of Fig. 5D verify this prediction as they show a significant enrichment of the Nova-2-induced JNK2 exon 6a in HDML-2 cells as compared with the reference cell line. Quantification of the results from five different experiments indicated a 2–3-fold increase in exon 6a utilization in Nova-2-expressing HDML-2 cells, a slight increase in Nova-1-expressing HD-MY-Z cells, and no effect in L-540 cells, which do not express either protein (Fig. 5E). These results further argue that expression of Nova proteins is sufficient to induce neuron-enriched patterns of splicing in non-neural cells. Given the prevalence and relevance of alternative splicing in higher eukaryotes, it seems likely that many aspects of the phenotype of a cell, including those leading to tumor progression, are controlled by the relative expression of alternatively spliced isoforms of multiple genes. Our results indeed suggest that general patterns of alternative splicing, as well as expression of particular splicing regulators, can be indicative of cell transformation and of tumor grade. If this is the case, microarrays able to discriminate between alternatively spliced isoforms will obviously have important medical applications. The fraction of changes observed between Hodgkin cell lines and the reference cell line is substantial, affecting 20–30% of the splicing events analyzed and showing a 2–3-fold better correlation for cell lines derived from tumors of the same grade (Table I). In the vast majority of cases, these changes are exon- or splice junction-specific, indicating that they do not correspond to a general increase or decrease in the output of a gene but that they represent bona fide changes in splicing rather than transcription. Intriguingly, some of the changes detected affect exons described previously as constitutive (e.g. in the CD21 gene), even when no changes were observed in other regions of the pre-mRNA described previously as alternatively spliced. This is consistent with the suggestion that significant, albeit not general, changes in the mechanisms of exon definition occur in tumor cells (7Brinkman B.M. Clin. Biochem. 2004; 37: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) Given that 1) changes in the relative expression of general splicing factors can modulate alternative splicing of multiple genes (15Caceres J.F. Kornblihtt A.R.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3574-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it has been postulated that the relative expression of splicing factors acts as a “cellular code” that establishes patterns of alternative splicing in multiple genes (13Smith C.W.J. Valcárcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 14Black D.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 367-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Clustering analyses similar to those shown in Fig. 3, however, did not show the same degree of correlation between tumor grade and overall changes in the expression of splicing factors as they did with changes in splicing (data not shown). Similarly, splicing events were 5-fold more frequent than splicing factors in the list of array features that provided the best discrimination between cell lines (GeneSpring 6.2 analysis of variance software, data not shown). It is possible that global changes in splicing factor concentrations are not as predictive of tumor grade as the expression of isoforms of genes involved in cell cycle control, signaling, adhesion, etc., and therefore, that changes in a relatively small number of splicing regulators, or in their activities via post-translational modifications, are responsible for changes in a significant number of alternative splicing events. Alternatively, because a large fraction of splicing factor genes are themselves alternatively spliced, mRNA-based analysis of their expression may not be as predictive as changes in the expression of individual isoforms. Microarrays designed to detect expression of alternatively spliced isoforms of splicing factors will help test this possibility. Nevertheless, changes in splicing regulatory proteins were also detected. An interesting observation was that individual components of splicing complexes appeared to be regulated independently of other partners. This was the case for the 65-kDa subunit of the splicing factor U2AF (Fig. 4A) and for the U2 snRNP component SAP155 (Fig. 4B), the levels of which were increased without parallel increases in U2AF35 or some other components of U2. It is conceivable that a U2AF complex devoid of its 35 Kd subunit causes changes in 3′ splice site recognition (32Wu S. Romfo C.M. Nilsen T.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and that an excess of SAP155, which has repeats that are targets of cdk2 phosphorylation (33Wang C. Chua K. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Gozani O. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), can titrate the activity of this kinase and influence cell cycle progression. Ectopic expression of Nova proteins was originally reported in lung and breast tumors, leading to the production of autoantibodies that are thought to be the cause for the subsequent development of motor disorders in these patients (26Buckanovich R.J. Posner J.B. Darnell R.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 657-672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 27Darnell R.B. Arch. Neurol. 2004; 61: 30-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our microarray analyses revealed expression of Nova-1 and -2 in some Hodgkin cell lines, observations that were independently confirmed and extended to other Hodgkin cell lines and tumor samples (Fig. 5). These findings could provide pathophysiological basis for explaining the clinical development of paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus in some Hodgkin patients (34Kay C.L. Davies-Jones GA. Singal R. Winfield D.A. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1993; 56: 831-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although Nova proteins have been implicated in neuron-specific splicing regulation (16Jensen K.B. Dredge B.K. Stefani G. Zhong R. Buckanovich R.J. Okano H.J. Yang Y.Y. Darnell R.B.

Science. 2003; 302: 1212-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), changes in alternative splicing caused by ectopic expression of these proteins in tumors or tumor cell lines, with potential effects in the regulation of cell proliferation, had not been reported. Our observation that expression of Nova-2 correlated with increased expression of neuronal isoforms of JNK2, together with the key roles that these proteins play in cell signaling, proliferation, and apoptosis (29Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar, 35Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), are compatible with the possibility that Nova-2 expression causes changes in alternative splicing that influence tumor progression. In summary, although larger data sets and powerful computational tools will be required for full exploitation of this microarray design, the results reported in this study have provided new insights of potential medical relevance, including an explanation for clinical reports of motor disorders in Hodgkin patients and a correlation between global changes in alternative splicing and cell transformation and tumor grade.

https://openalex.org/W2079997045,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-interacting protein, CFTR-associated ligand (CAL) down-regulates total and cell surface CFTR by targeting CFTR for degradation in the lysosome. Here, we report that a Rho family small GTPase TC10 interacts with CAL. This interaction specifically up-regulates CFTR protein expression. Co-expression of the constitutively active form, TC10Q75L, increases total and cell surface CFTR in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, co-expression of the dominant-negative mutant TC10T31N causes a dose-dependent reduction in mature CFTR. The effect of TC10 is independent of the level of CFTR expression, because a similar effect was observed in a stable cell line that expresses one-tenth of CFTR. Co-expression of TC10Q75L did not have a similar effect on the expression of plasma membrane proteins such as Frizzled-3 and Pr-cadherin or cytosolic proteins such as tubulin and green fluorescent protein. TC10Q75L also did not have a similar effect on the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. Co-expression of constitutively active and dominant-negative forms of Cdc42 or RhoA did not affect CFTR expression in a manner similar to TC10, indicating that the effect of TC10 is unique within the Rho family. Metabolic pulse-chase experiments show that TC10 did not affect CFTR maturation, suggesting that it exerts its effects on the mature CFTR. Importantly, TC10Q75L reverses CAL-mediated CFTR degradation, suggesting that TC10Q75L inhibits CAL-mediated degradation of CFTR. TC10Q75L does not operate by reducing CAL protein expression or its ability to form dimers or interact with CFTR. Interestingly, the expression of TC10Q75L causes a dramatic redistribution of CAL from the juxtanuclear region to the plasma membrane where the two molecules overlap. These data suggest that TC10 regulates both total and plasma membrane CFTR expression by interacting with CAL. The GTP-bound form of TC10 directs the trafficking of CFTR from the juxtanuclear region to the secretory pathway toward the plasma membrane, away from CAL-mediated degradation of CFTR in the lysosome.

Rho family small GTPases are molecular switches in signal transduction pathways that link cell surface receptors to a variety of intracellular responses (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). They regulate cellular processes as diverse as vesicular trafficking, cytoskeleton organization, cell polarity, cell migration, and gene expression. Like other GTPases, members of the Rho family cycle between a GDP-bound (inactive) and a GTP-bound (active) state. In the GTP-bound state, the GTPase couples signals that are initiated by growth factors, adhesion factors, cytokines, and other molecules to a large number of downstream effectors.Rho GTPases control multiple vesicular trafficking events that include macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, clathrin-independent endocytosis, mast cell degranulation, and exocytosis (2Symons M. Rusk N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R409-R418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). TC10, a member of the Rho family GTPase, regulates the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter Glut4 trafficking in adipocytes (3Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Traffic. 2003; 4: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The TC10 pathway functions in parallel with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to stimulate GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin (4Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). TC10 interacts with Exo70, a component of the exocyst complex. The activated TC10 translocates Exo70 to the plasma membrane where it assembles into a multiprotein complex that may play a crucial role in targeting GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane (5Inoue M.

CFTR follows a nonconventional pathway that is insensitive to dominant-negative Arf1, Rab1a/Rab2 GTPases, and syntaxin 5, eventually maturing from the core-glycosylated ER form to the complex-glycosylated form (7Yoo J.S.

The exocytosis of CFTR from the Golgi to the cell surface can be constitutive or regulated in a cell type-specific manner. From the cell surface, CFTR is endocytosed via the clathrin adaptor complex I (8Weixel K.M. Bradbury N.A. J. Biol.

Endosomal CFTR then either recycles back to the surface through a Rab11-dependent step or moves to late endosomes via Rab7 or to the trans-Golgi network via Rab9-mediated processes (13Gentzsch M.

CFTR in these post-Golgi compartments is degraded in the lysosomes and proteasomes. As an additional quality control system, any ΔF508 CFTR escaping the ER quality control machinery may be degraded in the cell periphery (14Benharouga M. Haardt M. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).CAL (also known as PIST (PDZ domain protein interacting specifically with TC10), GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein), and FIG (fused in glioblastoma)) is a Golgi-localized, CFTR-interacting protein that targets CFTR for degradation in lysosomal systems (11Cheng J. Wang H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1892-1898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CAL has one PDZ (PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1) domain and two coiled-coil domains. The PDZ domain binds to the C terminus of CFTR (15Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

The constitutively active form of TC10, TC10Q75L, redistributes CAL from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. TC10Q75L specifically increases the total cellular and the cell surface and CFTR. Thus, active TC10 regulates CFTR protein in a manner opposite to that of CFTR by CAL. TC10 may be a molecular switch that regulates CFTR levels at the plasma membrane and in the post-Golgi compartments in response to intracellular and extracellular stimuli.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) (obtained from American Type Tissue Culture) were maintained in DMEM, 20 mm l-glutamine, 100 unit/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Media and other components were purchased from Invitrogen. COS-7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Plasmids and Plasmid Constructions—The HA-tagged TC10 (HA-TC10) was made by PCR amplification of human lung cDNA and subcloning into SalI/NotI sites of the HA-tagged pRK5 vector (pRK5-HA) (gift from Drs.

Briefly, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble material. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were quantified with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The normalized supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The chemiluminescence signal on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was directly captured by a FujiFilm LAS-1000 plus system with 1,300,000-pixel cooled CCD camera having a linearity of 3.7 orders of magnitude. Quantification was carried out within the linear range using the Image Gauge version 3.2 software (FujiFilm). GFP-tagged proteins were detected with a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; BD Biosciences, Boston, MA). HA-tagged proteins were detected with a mouse monoclonal HA antibody (1:2000; Roche Applied Science) or a rabbit polyclonal HA antibody (1:500; Roche Applied Science). Myc-tagged proteins were detected with a mouse monoclonal Myc antibody (1:2000; Roche Applied Science). Vesicular stomatitis virus G was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (gift of Dr. C. E. Machamer, The Johns Hopkins University). Tubulin was detected with a mouse monoclonal tubulin antibody (1:1000; Sigma).Surface Biotinylation—Surface biotinylation of CFTR at the plasma membrane was described previously (15Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell surface proteins were labeled with cell-impermeable EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; Pierce) at 4 °C for 15 min. The cell surface proteins were isolated from lysate by incubating with immobilized NeutrAvidin beads at 4 °C for 2 h (Pierce; catalog number 53151). The bound proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm dithiothreitol at 42 °C for 30 min. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). GFP-CFTR was detected with a rabbit polyclonal GFP antibody (1:1000; BD Biosciences).Pulse-Chase—COS-7 cells were washed twice in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM and then incubated for 30 min in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM. The cells were incubated in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM containing TRAN-35S-label (250 μCi/ml) for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were washed extensively with DMEM containing 10 mm of unlabeled methionine and 10 mm of unlabeled cysteine and chased in this solution for the indicated times. Radiolabeled CFTR was immunoprecipitated with M3A7 and L12B14 monoclonal antibodies (Upstate, Waltham, MA), separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactive signal on the dried SDS-PAGE was scanned with a FujiFilm BAS-100 plus system. Quantification was carried out within the linear range using the Image Gauge version 3.2 software (FujiFilm).Confocal Microscopy—COS-7 cells were plated on glass coverslips 1 day before transfection. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 1 day post-transfection. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% normal goat serum. The cells were stained with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:2000; Roche Applied Science) in 5% normal goat serum, washed with 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with goat anti-mouse Cy3 secondary antibodies in 1% normal goat serum (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The specimens were mounted and viewed on an UltraVIEW spinning disk confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).GST-PAK Binding Assay—COS-7 cells transfected with HA-tagged constructs were lysed with magnesium-containing lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). GST-PAK-1 p21-binding domain (PBD)-agarose beads (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) were added immediately to the cell lysate (10 μg/ml). The lysates were gently mixed with the beads for 60 min at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed three times in the magnesium-containing lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm dithiothreitol at 42 °C for 30 min. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). HA-tagged proteins were detected with a rabbit polyclonal HA antibody (1:500; Roche Applied Science).Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± standard deviations. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. We assigned significance at p < 0.05.RESULTSIs the Expression of Mature CFTR Protein Influenced by TC10?—The CFTR-interacting protein, CAL, was shown to reduce the total cellular and the cell surface GFP-CFTR when co-expressed in COS-7 cells (11Cheng J. Wang H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1892-1898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E.

Previous studies have shown that GFP-CFTR exhibits single channel properties and intracellular trafficking patterns similar to that of wild type CFTR (18Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D. Halpin P.A. Karlson K.H. Ismailov I.I. Guggino W.B. Langford G.M. Stanton B.A. J. Biol.

In co-transfection studies, the HA-tagged, constitutively active form of TC10, HA-TC10Q75L, was used to study the effects of TC10 on CFTR (Fig. 1). TC10Q75L lacks GTPase activity and thus locks TC10 in the GTP-bound, constitutively active form (22Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Tatsis N. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, HA-TC10Q75L is enriched with GTP (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), co-expression of HA-TC10Q75L dramatically increases both the total cellular and the cell surface GFP-CFTR. For example, when 1 μg/dish HA-TC10Q75L was transfected, the total CFTR was 323 ± 40% (p < 0.05, n = 3), and the cell surface GFP-CFTR was 302 ± 71% (p < 0.05, n = 3) higher than that of the controls. Meanwhile, the abundance of tubulin, a cytoskeleton protein, was not affected (Fig. 1A). Co-expression of wild type TC10 had no effect on CFTR expression (data not shown). To verify these results further, the effect of TC10 on CFTR was investigated in a COS-7-derived cell line expressing a low level of CFTR, 4F2 (11Cheng J. Wang H. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1892-1898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, TC10Q75L also significantly increased the steady state levels of CFTR. We previously demonstrated that binding of CAL to the PDZ-binding motif at the C terminus of CFTR reduced the total cellular CFTR by enhancing its lysosomal degradation. The effect of CAL is shown in Fig. 1D. Lane 2 is 60.9 ± 5.2% (p < 0.05, n = 3) of that of lane 1 (p < 0.05, n = 3). Surprisingly, TC10Q75L reversed CAL-mediated CFTR degradation. Lane 4 is 101.5 ± 6.8% (p < 0.05, n = 3) of that of lane 3. These results suggest that TC10Q75L may suppress the inhibitory effect of CAL through a direct interaction with CAL.Inhibiting TC10 Reduces the Steady-state Level of CFTR— TC10 is modified by lipids at the C-terminal cysteine residues for farnesylation and dual palmitoylation (23Michaelson D.

The CAAX farnesylation motif is required for TC10 to enter the exocytic pathway from ER to Golgi. Upstream of CAAX sequence, a CXXC motif is found that functions in dual palmitoylation and plasma membrane targeting (26Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell.

Lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, blocks farnesylation (28Alberts A.W. Chen J. Kuron G. Hunt V. Huff J. Hoffman C. Rothrock J. Lopez M. Joshua H. Harris E.

Thirty μm lovastatin treatment reduces GFP-CFTR to 18.9 ± 3.1% (p < 0.05, n = 3) of untreated control cells (compare lane 3 with lane 1). Lovastatin also inhibits the effects of TC10Q75L on CFTR (lane 6 is 45.1 ± 7.8% of that of lane 4 (p < 0.05, n = 3)), further confirming that its effect on CFTR is through TC10 (Fig. 2A). To test whether lovastatin specifically inhibited the TC10 pathway, the HA-tagged, GDP-bound, dominant-negative form of TC10, TC10T31N, was co-transfected with GFP-CFTR into COS-7 cells. HA-TC10T31N decreased the level of GFP-CFTR (Fig. 2, B and C). When 3 μg/dish HA-TC10T31N was transfected, the total CFTR is reduced to 40 ± 4% of the control (p < 0.05, n = 3).Fig. 2Inhibiting TC10 activity reduces CFTR expression. A, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with GFP-CFTR (3 μg/dish) and HA-TC10Q75L (1 μg/dish) as indicated. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were treated with lovastatin for 16 h. The cells were lysed, and CFTR was detected by Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody to GFP. B, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with GFP-CFTR (3 μg/dish) and HA-TC10Q75L or HA-TC10T31N as indicated. The cells were lysed, and CFTR was detected as in described in the legend for Fig. 1.

Neither GFP nor Frizzled-3 binds to CAL (15Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

All of the GFP-tagged proteins used have the same cytomegalovirus promoters, eliminating a nonspecific effect on promoter activity. Co-transfection of HA-TC10Q75L did not dramatically alter the abundance of these proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, HA-TC10Q75L had no effect on the cell surface of VSV-G (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that TC10 increases GFP-CFTR by mechanisms that do not involve transcription, acting on the GFP moiety of the fusion proteins or the exocytosis of plasma membrane proteins in general.Fig. 3The effect of TC10 is specific for CFTR. A, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with HA-TC10Q75L (1 μg/dish) and GFP, Frizzled-3GFP, or Pr-cadherin-GFP (PrCadGFP) (3 μg/dish) as indicated. The cells were lysed, and the proteins were detected as described in the legend for Fig. 1. B, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with VSV-G (3 μg/dish) and HA-TC10Q75L (1 μg/dish) as indicated. The cell surface proteins and total cell lysates were detected as in Fig. 1, except a rabbit polyclonal VSV-G antibody was used. C, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with GFP-CFTR (3 μg/dish) and either HA-Cdc42N17 (3 μg/dish) or HA-Cdc42N17 (3 μg/dish) as indicated. The cell surface proteins and total cell lysates were detected as described in the legend for Fig. 1. The data shown are representative of three experiments.

They share over 90% amino acid identity. Rho family GTPase are involved in vesicular trafficking, cytoskeleton organization, cell polarity, cell migration, and gene expression. As shown in Fig. 3C, neither the constitutively active (HA-Cdc42-QL) nor the dominant-negative (HA-Cdc42-N17) form of Cdc42 affects the abundance of CFTR. Co-expression of the constitutively active and dominant-negative forms of RhoA also has no effect on the abundance of CFTR (data not shown). Thus, not only is the effect of TC10 specific for CFTR, but other Rho-GTPases do not have similar effects on CFTR levels.What Is the Effect of TC10 on CFTR Maturation?—To test the possibility that TC10 increases CFTR synthesis and/or maturation, we examined the synthesis and maturation of CFTR using metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments. In Fig. 4A, COS-7 cells were transfected with GFP-CFTR with or without HA-TC10Q75L and, after 16 h, metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine for 30 min. The maturation of CFTR was followed by chasing for 1–4 h. Maturation can be gauged by the initial appearance and subsequent decrease of newly synthesized core-glycosylated CFTR (band B), with a concomitant increase in the mature C band. Fig. 4A shows that GFP-CFTR matures similarly whether transfected or not transfected with TC10Q75L. There is no significant difference in fractional conversion between the B band at 0 h and the C band at 4 h in the absence or presence of HA-TC10Q75L (26.6 ± 3.9% versus 28.4 ± 2.6%, respectively, p > 0.05, n = 3). Therefore, TC10 exerts its effects on mature CFTR and does not affect the synthesis and trafficking to Golgi. To test this hypothesis directly, the effect of TC10Q75L on mature CFTR was examined. GFP-CFTR becomes fully mature after chasing for 4 h (Fig. 4A). There is no significant difference in the amount of CFTR in TC10Q75L-transfected and untransfected cells. The mature CFTR was then followed as cells were chased for an additional 4–20 h. As shown in Fig. 4B, at 20 and 26 h, more 35S-labeled mature CFTR in"

BP is a byproduct of grilled foods and tobacco and fuel combustion and has long been linked to various human cancers, particularly lung and skin. BP is metabolized to diol epoxides that covalently modify DNA bases to form bulky adducts that block DNA synthesis by replicative or high fidelity DNA polymerases. Here we present the structure of a high fidelity polymerase from a thermostable strain of Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bacillus fragment) bound to the most common BP-derived N2-guanine adduct base-paired with cytosine. The BP adduct adopts a conformation that places the polycyclic BP moiety in the nascent DNA minor groove and is the first structure of a minor groove adduct bound to a polymerase. Orientation of the BP moiety into the nascent DNA minor groove results in extensive disruption to the interactions between the adducted DNA duplex and the polymerase.

During replication, steric and geometric constraints are imposed on the template base as it moves from a pre-insertion site (see schematic, Fig. 2), where the template base is sequestered before pairing opposite an incoming dNTP, to the insertion site, where base pairs that exhibit the shape and geometry of correct Watson-Crick base pairs are selected in favor of base pairs that do not (39Goodman M.F.

The steric and geometric constraints at the pre-insertion and insertion sites contribute to the accuracy of replication achieved by high fidelity polymerases and would not be expected to accommodate [BP]dG without significant distortion of the polymerase active site. After nucleotide incorporation at the insertion site, the newly formed base pair translocates to the post-insertion site. Here and throughout the DNA duplex binding region, the polymerase engages in extensive interactions with the DNA minor groove, whereas the DNA major groove is predominantly solvent-exposed. Interactions between the DNA duplex and the polymerase are inevitably compromised by [BP]dG, a minor groove adduct.Fig. 2[BP]dG at the post-insertion site of the BF active site.

However, the structure of a DNA polymerase bound to a bulky minor-groove DNA adduct has yet to be determined.Here we report a high resolution structure of the minor groove (+)-trans-[BP]dG adduct, the major product of the reaction of (+)-anti-BPDE with cellular DNA, at the BF active site. The [BP]dG adduct is observed in an anti conformation at the post-insertion site, where it forms Watson-Crick base pairs with an opposing cytosine. The polycyclic aromatic BP ring system protrudes into the nascent minor groove and induces distortions to the polymerase and both strands of the DNA duplex. Such distortion has not previously been observed in structures of DNA mismatches or lesions at the polymerase active site. The extensive nature of these distortions accounts for the blocking effect of [BP]dG on DNA replication.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of BP-modified DNA Duplexes—A Biosearch Cyclone automated DNA synthesizer was used to synthesize the oligonucleotides for this study.

The modified oligonucleotides eluted in the order (10R(+)-cis-, 10R(-)-trans-, 10S(-)-cis, and 10S(+)-trans-anti-BP-N2-dG) as described (45Pirogov N.S. Shafirovich V. Kolbanovskiy A. Solntsev K.

The oligonucleotide containing the single (+)-trans-anti-BP-N2-dG adduct was purified by repeated HPLC cycles with similar protocols. The stereochemical properties of the modified oligonucleotide containing the (+)-trans adduct were verified as described (7Cheng S.C. Hilton B.D. Roman J.M. Dipple A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 44Geacintov N.E. Cosman M. Mao B. Alfano A. Ibanez V. Harvey R.G. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 2099-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Primer Extension Assays—In vitro primer extension reactions were carried out with 43-mer template strands where the (+)-trans-anti-BP-N2-dG lesions are positioned at the 25th nucleotide (counting from the 3′-side) as described (14Huang X. Kolbanovskiy A. Wu X. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zhuang P. Amin S. Geacintov N.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2456-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The 43-mer templates were annealed with a 32P-labeled 19-mer primer (Fig. 1B). A time course of primer extension assays of the adducted templates with BF was determined at 37 °C in 10 μl of buffered solutions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg ml-1 bovine serum albumin, 4% glycerol, 4.5 nm primer-template complexes, 100 μm dNTPs, and 20 nm of the polymerase. Corresponding unmodified primer/template complexes were extended as controls. The reaction conditions for the unmodified DNA substrates were the same as those for the modified templates, except that the enzyme concentration was 0.025 nm. The reactions were stopped after preselected time intervals by the addition of a 7 μl of stop solution (20 mm EDTA, 95% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol). Characterization of dNTP incorporation preference opposite [BP]dG was performed using DNA duplexes identical to those used for crystallization. Corresponding unmodified primer-template complexes were extended as controls. The 15-mer BP-modified and unmodified templates were annealed with a 32P-labeled 9-mer primer (Fig. 1C). Reaction conditions were identical to those described above for extension of the 19-mer primer except that 5 mm dCTP, dTTP, dATP, or dATP and 10 nm BF (for BP-modified duplex) or 200 μm dNTP and 0.1 nm BF (for unmodified duplex) and 100 nm DNA duplex (both BP-modified and unmodified) were used. Reactions were performed at 25 °C to prevent the duplex from unannealing and allowed to proceed for 10 min before quenching with the stop solution. All reactions were heated to 90 °C (5 min) and chilled on ice (1 min). Reaction products were separated by gel electrophoresis (20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea), visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated by a Storm 840 PhosphorImager using Storm ImageQuant software.Co-crystallization of BP-modified DNA Duplexes with BF—BP-modified DNA templates 5′-d(ACTC-[BP]dG-CACCATCCCT) were annealed to DNA primers (5′-GGGATGGTG and 5′-GGGATGGTGC). Duplexes were incubated with purified BF (11 mg ml-1) in a 3:1 molar ratio of DNA to protein for 1 h before setup of crystallization as described (47Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Hansen C.J. Basehore S.L.

Crystals were grown in 49% saturated ammonium sulfate, 2.5% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, and 10 mm MgSO4 by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Nucleotide incorporation and extension was attempted in the crystal by transferring a crystal into stabilization solution composed of 60% saturated ammonium sulfate, 2.5% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, 60 mm MgSO4, and 30 mm dNTP for 24 h, 1 week, or 1 month at room temperature.Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Superposition—Crystals were transferred to cryoprotectant solution (60% saturated ammonium sulfate, 24% sucrose, 100 mm MES, pH 5.8) before being flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at beamline X12-B at Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (48Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). The co-crystals belong to space group P212121 and contain one molecule per asymmetric unit. Phases were calculated using molecular replacement (BF bound to unmodified DNA duplex, PDB entry 1L3S, as the probe), and models were refined using CNS (49Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Force field and topology parameters allowing multiple sugar pucker conformations were used for the DNA and were modified to include parameters for the [BP]dG residue generated using PRODRG (50van Aalten D.M.

The quality of the final models was assessed using PROCHECK (52Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). The structure of BF bound to [BP]dG was superimposed with the structure of BF bound to an unmodified DNA duplex (PDB entry 1L5U). A model of BP at the insertion site of BF in a ternary complex with DNA duplex and an incoming dNTP was constructed by superimposing the structure of BF bound to C:[BP]dG (primer-template) at the post-insertion site (BP2, PDB entry 1XC9) with the structure of BF bound to unmodified duplex DNA and an incoming dNTP (PDB entry 1LV5). All superpositions were done using the Cα atoms of BF residues 646-655, 823-838, and 863-869.RESULTS[BP]dG Blocks DNA Replication by BF in Solution—Primer extension assays using unmodified and BP-modified oligonucleotides as templates demonstrate the blocking potential of the [BP]dG adduct on replication by BF as shown in Fig. 1. Replication of the unmodified DNA templates is highly efficient at low enzyme concentration (0.025 nm) with full extension products observed within 2 min of reaction initiation. By contrast, replication of BP-modified templates is blocked either before (position 24, Fig. 1B) or after base incorporation opposite [BP]dG (position 25) despite a ∼1000-fold higher enzyme concentration (20 nm). At this enzyme concentration, full primer extension does not exceed a few percent even after an incubation time of 30 min (Fig. 1B, right-hand panel). Insertion of dNTP opposite [BP]dG is notably more facile than synthesis past the lesion (Fig. 1B, right-hand panel) with dCTP being the preferred nucleotide incorporated opposite [BP]dG with ∼11% of primers extended (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate the potency of [BP]dG as a block to DNA replication, especially primer extension past the lesion.Structures of [BP]dG at the Pre-insertion and Post-insertion Sites—A co-crystal structure of BF bound to a DNA duplex where [BP]dG is positioned as the n template base was determined to 1.9 Å of resolution (complex BP1, Table I). This structure represents BF before nucleotide incorporation opposite [BP]dG. In unmodified DNA, the n template base occupies the pre-insertion site at this stage of the reaction cycle of BF (35Johnson S.J. Taylor J.S. Beese L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3895-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). By contrast, the modified [BP]dG template base does not occupy the pre-insertion site when placed at the n template base but is instead disordered. In this structure all other parts of the DNA duplex and the polymerase, including the preinsertion site, post-insertion site, and catalytic site, are well ordered and resemble the structure of BF bound to unmodified DNA duplexes (34Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Braman J.C. Beese L.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 35Johnson S.J. Taylor J.S. Beese L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

First, enzymatic nucleotide incorporation in the crystal was attempted by soaking crystals of the BP1 complex in stabilization solutions containing dNTP. In the BF crystal, complete nucleotide incorporation opposite unmodified bases is typically observed within 1 h. However, nucleotide incorporation opposite [BP]dG was not observed even after 1 month of soaking; pre- and post-soak structures were identical, indicating that nucleotide incorporation had not occurred. Second, BF was co-crystallized with duplex DNA, resulting in a complex with [BP]dG paired opposite cytosine at the post-insertion site (BP2, Table I). This co-crystallization strategy has been used successfully to capture DNA mismatches at the post-insertion site that are indistinguishable from structures of the same DNA mismatches determined after enzymatic synthesis in the crystal (38Johnson S.J. Beese L.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 803-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).The co-crystal structure of BF bound to C:[BP]dG (primer-template) at the post-insertion site (Fig. 2) reveals extensive distortions to both the DNA duplex and the polymerase. Distortions to the DNA duplex extend from the n-1 (post-insertion site) to the n-4 position (the DNA duplex region) (Fig. 3B). At each of these positions, Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds between the bases are retained, but the base pair parameters are distorted (Table II). At the n-1 position, [BP]dG adopts an anti conformation (χ = O4′-C1′-N9-C4 = 277°, α′ = N1-C2-N2-(BP)C10 = 177°, and β′ = C2-N2-(BP)C10-(BP)C9 = 294°), which in addition to promoting Watson-Crick bonds with the opposing cytosine, results in protrusion of the polycyclic BP moiety into the DNA minor groove. [BP]dG also adopts an anti conformation in structures of DNA duplexes not bound to polymerase where C:[BP]dG is at the template-primer junction (χ = 269 ± 20°, α′ = 196 ± 2°, and β′ = 278 ± 6°) (42Feng B. Gorin A. Hingerty B.E. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13769-13779Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the context of BF, [BP]dG forces polymerase side chains to adopt alternate conformations such that the interactions between the protein and the C:[BP]dG base pair are lost (Fig. 3C). Rather than form direct hydrogen bonds with the minor groove of the newly formed base pair, protein residues Arg-615 and Gln-797 are confined to the floor of the active site, far removed from the primer and template strands, which lift away from the surface of the polymerase. This displacement of the primer strand results in loss of coordination between the primer 3′-OH and the universally conserved catalytic Asp-830. The hydrogen bond distance between the primer 3′-OH and Asp-830 is normally 2.5 Å; in the BP2 complex, this distance is 6.9 Å. The 3′-OH is, therefore, no longer in position for in-line attack during nucleotide addition.Fig. 3[BP]dG-induced distortions to the BF polymerase active site.

HCMV encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), referred to as US28, that displays homology to the human chemokine receptor CCR1 and binds several chemokines of the CC family as well as the CX3C chemokine fractalkine with high affinity. Most importantly, following HCMV infection, US28 activates several intracellular pathways, either constitutively or in a chemokine-dependent manner. In this study, our goal was to understand the molecular interactions between chemokines and the HCMV-encoded US28 receptor. To achieve this goal, a double approach has been used, consisting in the analysis of both receptor and ligand mutants. This approach has led us to identify several amino acids located in the N terminus of US28 that differentially contribute to the high affinity binding of CC versus CX3C chemokines. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of secondary modifications occurring at US28, such as sulfation, for ligand recognition. Finally, the effects of chemokine dimerization and interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on chemokine binding and activation of US28 were investigated as well using CCL4 as model ligand. In line with the two-state model describing chemokine/receptor interaction, we show that an aromatic residue in the N-loop region of CCL4 promotes tight binding to US28, whereas receptor activation depends on the presence of the N terminus of CCL4, as shown previously for CCR5.

Chemokines are a group of small (8–14 kDa), mostly basic soluble proteins that have been shown through crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance structure determination to adopt a similar fold, even in cases of low overall sequence identity (1Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar, 2Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Chemokines are classified (CC, CXC, CX3C, and XC) based on the number and sequential relationship of the first two of four conserved cysteine residues (3Murphy P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 54: 227-229Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Chemokines play key roles in many aspects of the immune and inflammatory responses, primarily by attracting and activating leukocytes (4Locati M. Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 5Schall T.J. Bacon K.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Chemokine signaling is dependent on binding to a family of seven transmembrane-spanning, G-protein-coupled receptors (6Horuk R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 159-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which triggers intracellular signal transduction events, such as calcium mobilization and phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinases (7Wells T.N. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 376-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Another common aspect of chemokines is their ability to interact with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; SMCs, smooth muscle cells; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted. 1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; SMCs, smooth muscle cells; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted. usually heparan sulfate, and several lines of evidence point out the importance of heparan sulfate in promoting chemokine activity (8Proudfoot A.E. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Such interactions are of physiological relevance, as they presumably contribute to the formation of chemotactic gradients at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrices, which are essential for chemokine-mediated cell trafficking (9Ali S. Fritchley S.J. Chaffey B.T. Kirby J.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is currently debated whether GAG binding may also influence chemokine structure and activity in other ways. In support of this notion, enzymatic removal of cell surface GAGs reduces the ability of Gro-α/CXCL1 to bind and activate its cell surface receptor, CXCR2 (10Wang D. Sai J. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GAG-induced increase in local chemokine concentration could be critical to potentiate the interaction with its receptor, or GAGs could represent a fundamental component of the receptor-ligand complex. The understanding of chemokine action is further complicated by the fact that many chemokines have been shown to form tight dimers (11Qian Y.Q. Johanson K.O. McDevitt P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Skelton N.J. Aspiras F. Ogez J. Schall T.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22471-22479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The physiological role of the chemokine dimer in the interaction with the chemokine receptor is not yet fully understood. Because chemokines are key players in orchestrating the migration and activation of leukocytes, viruses have developed several ways to affect the chemokine signaling for their own benefit (15Murphy P.M. Nat. Immun. 2001; 2: 116-122Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These strategies represent efficacious ways to evade host immune responses. For example, several viruses belonging to the β- and γ-herpesvirus family encode for GPCRs which show sequence homology to mammalian chemokine receptors and bind chemokines with high affinity (16Smit M.J. Vink C. Verzijl D. Casarosa P. Bruggeman C.A. Leurs R. Curr. Drug Targets. 2003; 4: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These vGPCRs might help the virus to subvert the host chemokine signaling system. Additionally, they might help the virus in immune evasion, acting as scavengers of endogenous chemokines through rapid endocytosis (16Smit M.J. Vink C. Verzijl D. Casarosa P. Bruggeman C.A. Leurs R. Curr. Drug Targets. 2003; 4: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Rosenkilde M.M. Waldhoer M. Luttichau H.R. Schwartz T.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The β-herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) HCMV is a widely spread virus that is able to establish a lifelong persisting infection in the host in a latent form (18Sweet C. FEMS Microbiol.

Satchwell S.C. Preddie E. Weston K.M. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). HCMV-encoded chemokine receptor US28 is so far the best characterized and has been shown to display several interesting pharmacological features. First of all, US28 possesses a large spectrum chemokine binding profile, because it recognizes chemokines belonging to the CC family, such as RANTES/CCL5, Mip-1α/CCL3, Mip-1β/CCL4, and MCP-1/CCL2, as well as the CX3C chemokine fractalkine/CX3CL1 (27Kledal T.N.

Commun. 1995; 211: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In accordance with its binding profile, US28 has been suggested to act as a chemokine scavenger. Depletion of chemokines from the medium was in fact demonstrated following HCMV infection, due to internalization of US28 (29Billstrom M.A. Lehman L.A. Scott Worthen G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Bodaghi B. Jones T.R. Zipeto D. Vita C. Sun L. Laurent L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Michelson S. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Because chemokines play a crucial role in regulation of the immune system, chemokine sequestration by US28 could help HCMV escape immune surveillance. Additionally, US28 can activate several intracellular pathways. Most interestingly, some of these pathways are constitutively activated by the US28 receptor. We and others have shown previously that US28 constitutively signals through a Gαq pathway leading to activation of phospholipase C when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, as well as after HCMV infection (31Casarosa P.

Moreover, US28 can constitutively activate NF-κB, a transcription factor that plays an important role in inflammatory events such as atherosclerosis (31Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M.

Most interestingly, chemokines belonging to the CC family do not modulate the constitutive activation of phospholipase C and NF-κB by US28 in both transfected as well as HCMV-infected cells (31Casarosa P.

In contrast, US28 activates other pathways in a ligand-dependent fashion. For example, CC chemokines, such as RANTES/CCL5 and Mip1α/CCL3, induce calcium release in US28-transfected cells (35Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28539-28542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Billstrom M.A. Johnson G.L. Avdi N.J. Worthen G.S. J.

Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A.

In collaboration with Streblow (38Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J. Smith P. Wakabayashi E. Ruchti F. Mattison K. Altschuler Y. Nelson J.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), we have recently shown that this agonistic effect of CC chemokines on US28 involves activation of focal adhesion kinases (39Streblow D.N.

US28-mediated SMC migration provides an additional molecular basis for the correlative evidence that links HCMV to the acceleration of vascular disease (38Streblow D.N. Soderberg-Naucler C. Vieira J.

In this study, we aimed at better understanding the molecular interactions between chemokines and the HCMV-encoded US28 receptor. To achieve this goal, a double approach has been used, consisting in the analysis of both receptor and ligand mutants. Moreover, the effect of chemokine dimerization and interaction with GAGs on chemokine binding and activation of US28 was investigated as well. The two N-terminal truncation mutants of US28 were generated by PCR and subsequently subcloned in the mammalian vector pcDEF3 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Langer). Single amino acid mutations in the hexad of US28 were introduced using the Altered Sites® II in vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol, using the HA-tagged US28 receptor as template. Subsequently, all mutants were subcloned in pcDEF3. All constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Mutations of CCL4 were produced using the Quikchange procedure (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in a variant of the Novagen pET32LIC vector as described previously (40Laurence J.S. Blanpain C. Burgner J.W. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Wild type and all point mutants were expressed in the pET-32 vector and contained no N-terminal modification. The plasmids were transfected into BL21-(DE3) cells (Novagen), and the protein was produced and purified as described previously (40Laurence J.S. Blanpain C. Burgner J.W. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), using a modified procedure from Kuna et al. (41Kuna P. Reddigari S.R. Schall T.J. Rucinski D. Sadick M. Kaplan A.P. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1932-1943PubMed Google Scholar) to refold each mutant. COS-7 cells were grown as described previously (31Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Transfection of the COS-7 cells was performed by DEAE-dextran, using 2 μg of DNA of each US28 construct per million cells (31Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R.

SVEC4-10 is an endothelial cell line derived by SV40 (strain 4a) transformation of endothelial cells from murine axillary lymph node vessels (ATCC CRL2181). SVEC4-10 cells were grown at 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. SVEC4-10 cells were transfected with the US28-YFP fusion construct inserted into the PTEJ8 expression vector with Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells stably expressing US28 were selected in media containing 500 μg/ml neomycin G418. Clones were selected based on fluorescence, and US28 expression was further confirmed by chemokine binding analysis. Labeling of CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and the chemokine domain of CX3CL1 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) with 125I was performed with IODO-GEN as described previously (42Gruijthuijsen Y.K. Casarosa P. Kaptein S.J. Broers J.L. Leurs R. Bruggeman C.A. Smit M.J. Vink C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Chemokine binding affinity for the different US28 mutants was determined in homologous displacement studies, as described previously (32Casarosa P. Menge W.M. Minisini R. Otto C. van Heteren J.

Briefly, 2 days after transfection, COS-7 cells were incubated with 0.3 nm of radiolabeled chemokine (1 nm for 125I-CCL3) in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of cold competitor for 3 h at 4 °C. After incubation, cells were washed four times at 4 °C with binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. In some experiments, transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with sodium chlorate (10 mm) in sulfate-free medium for 48 h before performing the binding experiment. Membrane isolation and purification was performed as described previously (43Struyf S. Proost P. Schols D. Clercq DeE. Opdenakker G. Lenaerts J.P. Detheux M. Parmentier M. De Meester I. Scharpe S. Van Damme J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4903-4909PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 days after transfection COS-7 cells were resuspended in buffer A (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA), homogenized, and span down for 30 min at 48,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B (7.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose), aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C until use. For dissociation kinetic studies, membranes (3 μg/sample) were first allowed to equilibrate with 0.4 nm125I-CCL5 or 125I-CX3CL1 in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) at 30 °C for at least 1 h. Afterward, the cold chemokine (100-fold excess) was added, and samples were further incubated at 30 °C. At the different time points, samples were filtered through Whatman GF/C filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine, followed by three washes with binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl, using a Brandel harvester. Samples with membranes from mock-transfected cells were carried along to determine aspecific binding at each time point. SVEC4-10 cells stably expressing US28 were seeded in 96-well black wall clear-bottom microplates (Corning Glass) at 4 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were loaded for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark with 4 μm cell-permeant Fluo4-AM (Fluo4 acetoxymethyl ester) and 0.04% pluronic acid (both from Molecular Probes) in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm probenecid, 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then washed twice and preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm probenecid, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization upon stimulation with tested chemokines was monitored at 37 °C as fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 520 nm, respectively, using a Novostar microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies GmbH, Offenburg, Germany). After 60 s cells were lysed by adding 5% Triton X-100 to determine maximum fluorescence. All data shown are expressed as percentage of maximum fluorescence. Experiments in COS-7 cells were performed as described previously (31Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1133-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, receptor expression in COS-7 cells was measured by ELISA as described previously (32Casarosa P. Menge W.M. Minisini R. Otto C. van Heteren J. Jongejan A. Timmerman H. Moepps B. Kirchhoff F. Mertens T. Smit M.J. Leurs R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5172-5178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. J. van Minnen, Vrije University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was used as primary antibody, and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) was used as secondary antibody. The TMB solution (Sigma) was used as substrate, and the optical density was measured in a Victor2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 450 nm. Feeding Experiments—To directly examine that the mutant US28 receptors were in fact intact and reached the cell surface (and were not merely stuck intracellularly or retained in the endoplasmic reticulum due to improper protein folding), we conducted antibody feeding experiments (see also Ref. 44Waldhoer M.

This experimental setup allows us to assess distributions of receptors that were accessible to the HA antibody during a 30-min incubation period. COS-7 cells expressing the receptor constructs 2 days after transfection were used for immunofluorescence. 24 h post-transfection, cells were plated to coverslips and allowed to grow for 24 h. Living cells were fed monoclonal anti-HA 11 antibody (Covance, Berkeley, CA) for 30 min to label receptors. Subsequently, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, essentially as described (44Waldhoer M.

Staining Experiments—For cells not fed with monoclonal anti-HA11 antibody, living cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X, and first incubated with monoclonal anti-HA11 antibody for 40 min at room temperature. Subsequently, all cells were visualized with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary donkey-anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes). Following staining, cells were mounted in Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed using a Zeiss LSM510 META Axioplan 2 confocal microscope. Data Analysis—Curve fitting of data was carried out using the program Prism, and IC50 values were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Chemokine Interaction with US28 as Studied with MIP-1β/CCL4 Mutants—In order to better understand the molecular interactions occurring between chemokines and US28, we chose Mip-1β/CCL4 as a model ligand and analyzed the behavior of several mutants for their ability to bind and activate US28. Functional analysis of several chemokines has led to the general conclusion that the N-terminal portion of the protein preceding the Cys motif is responsible for receptor activation (45Wells T.N. Power C.A. Lusti-Narasimhan M. Hoogewerf A.J. Cooke R.M. Chung C.W. Peitsch M.C. Proudfoot A.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 46Pakianathan D.R. Kuta E.G. Artis D.R. Skelton N.J. Hebert C.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9642-9648Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To check whether this model applies to US28 as well, CCL4-Δ8, a truncated analogue which lacks the first 8 amino acids, was tested. Our results indicate that CCL4-Δ8 binds to US28 with high affinity, similarly to CCL4 wild type (pKi = 8.8 ± 0.1 and 8.7 ± 0.1, respectively; Fig. 1A), whereas it is strongly impaired in promoting US28-mediated calcium release (Fig. 1B). These data imply that the N terminus of the chemokine does not contribute to high affinity binding, whereas it is an essential determinant for receptor activation. Furthermore, we analyzed whether chemokine dimerization and interaction with GAGs affect the pharmacology of CCL4 at US28. For CC chemokines, it is known that basic residues in the 40s loop are involved in GAGs binding (47McCornack M.A. Cassidy C.K. LiWang P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1946-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas hydrophobic interactions along the N terminus are essential for dimer formation (13Laurence J.S. LiWang A.C. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9346-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The single amino acid mutant CCL4-P8A, for example, was shown previously to be unable to dimerize even at very high concentrations, although it can bind to GAGs similarly to CCL4-WT (40Laurence J.S. Blanpain C. Burgner J.W. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The triple mutant in the 40s loop CCL4-[K45A/R46A/K48A], on the other hand, dimerizes similarly to WT protein but is impaired in the interaction with GAGs (48Laurence J.S. Blanpain C. De Leener A. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4990-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This set of mutants can therefore be used to analyze separately the possible involvement of chemokine dimerization and GAG binding on US28. In displacement studies against 125I-CCL4, both mutants show high affinity for US28, with Ki values comparable with the wild type chemokine (pKi = 8.8 ± 0.1 for CCL4-WT and mutants; Fig. 1C). Additionally, CCL4 WT and the mutants CCL4-P8A and CCL4-[K45A/R46A/K48A] induced a similar calcium efflux in US28-expressing cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data imply that both chemokine oligomerization and interaction with GAGs are not necessary for chemokine binding and activation of the US28 receptor in vitro. According to the two-state model describing chemokine/receptor interaction, the N-loop region of chemokines (residues 13–20) promotes tight binding to the chemokine receptor (46Pakianathan D.R. Kuta E.G. Artis D.R. Skelton N.J. Hebert C.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9642-9648Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 49Bondue A. Jao S.C. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13548-13555Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An amino acid alignment of all chemokines known to bind to US28 shows that an aromatic residue present in the N-loop region after the C(X)nC cluster is highly conserved (Fig. 2A), with CX3CL1/fractalkine being the only exception. In order to study the potential role of this conserved aromatic residue in US28 binding, we analyzed the behavior of the mutant CCL4-F13A in equilibrium binding assays against wild type CCL4. Fig. 2B shows that CCL4-F13A has a considerable lower affinity (pKi = 7.7 ± 0.1; Fig. 2B) for US28 when compared with wild type CCL4, with a shift of more than 1 log unit. These data indicate that the aromatic phenylalanine residue located after the CC cluster is an essential determinant for the interaction of this chemokine with US28. In line with the loss of affinity binding for US28, CCL4-F13A was unable to induce a consistent calcium flux (Fig. 2C).

However, this does not exclude the possibility that the Emb proteins contain functional motifs or domains typical for other protein families. Belanger et al. (11Belanger A.E. Besra G.S. Ford M.E.

In a search for clearly identifiable functional segments, we have now conducted extensive analysis of short amino acid sequences within the Emb proteins, one of which is related to a proline-rich motif involved in polysaccharide chain length regulation by several bacterial membrane proteins, such as Wzz in Shigella flexneri, a member of a family of proteins that determines chain length in lipopolysaccharide synthesis (12Daniels C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and ExoP in Sinorhizobium meliloti, which regulates the synthesis of symbiotically important exopolysaccharides (13Becker A. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 395-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Pro motif, 2Because the Emb proteins have less prolines in the proline-rich motif than those originally described, they are referred to as the “Pro motif.”2Because the Emb proteins have less prolines in the proline-rich motif than those originally described, they are referred to as the “Pro motif.” is conserved in all three Emb paralogs, further suggesting a regulatory function in synthesis of arabinan of both AG and LAM. A putative glycosyltransferase superfamily C (GT-C) motif (14Liu J. Mushegian A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1418-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) was also identified in all three Emb paralogs. This present work describes changes in the structure of LAM in one case and complete ablation of synthesis in the other instance, as a consequence of point mutations in these two conserved motifs of EmbC of Mycobacterium smegmatis, thereby allowing presentation of a topological and functional model of Emb proteins in arabinan synthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSequence Analysis of Mycobacterial EmbA, EmbB, and EmbC—DNA sequence information from finished and unfinished genomes were obtained from TIGR (www.tigr.org) and NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Amino acid motifs within the Emb proteins were found by applying 100-amino acid-long sequences as query in PSI-BLAST searches (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar) in the nonredundant protein data base at NCBI. Protein hits with similarity to any of these fragments were investigated further through the following bioinformatic tools at ExPASy (us.expasy.org): amino acid sequences were aligned at ClustalW; similarity searches were performed by SIM alignment (16Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (831) Google Scholar); and secondary structure, hydrophobicity, and transmembrane topology were predicted by Jpred (17Cuff J.A. Barton G.J. Proteins. 2000; 40: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), TMpred (18Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar), and the Transmembrane Hidden Markov Model (TMHMM 2.0) (19Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8870) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—The 3225-bp ORF of embC from M. smegmatis mc2155 was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using primers (embC-f 5′-TTT CAT ATG ACC GGT CCG CAT GCA GCG GGT GGC-3′ and embC-r 5′-TTT AAG CTT CAA CTC AGC CGC AGG GGC GCC GGG-3′) including NdeI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR product was cloned into the vector pGEM (Promega Corp.) for sequence confirmation and subsequently ligated into pVV16 (derived from pMV261 (20Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennett L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. Snapper S.B. Barletta R.G. Jacobs W.R. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar)) after digestion with NdeI and HindIII to create a plasmid herein called pVE. The residues selected for site-directed mutagenesis in the Pro motif are contained within a 933-bp ApaI fragment (bp 1647–2579) in msembC. Forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (Apa-f, 5′-TTT GGG CCC GAG CAG ACG CAT CAT CG-3′, and Apa-r, 5′-TTT GGG CCC GCC TGG TCG CGG TCG-3′, respectively) were designed at the first and second ApaI site (underlined) for amplification of the ApaI fragment. Primers containing the desired point mutations (Table I) were designed. The mutagenic primers were combined with Apa-f and Apa-r to synthesize two DNA fragments of about 600 and 330 bp for each type of point mutation, which then were used in overlapping extension to generate the 933-bp fragments. These final fragments were cloned into pGEM for sequence confirmation and subsequently used in replacement of the corresponding wild type ApaI fragment in pVE. The pVED279A and pVED280G constructs were created by ligation of three DNA fragments as follows: linear pVV16 digested with NdeI and HindIII; the last 2369 bp of msembC purified from pVE after digestion with NcoI and HindIII; and a fragment encoding the first 856 bp of msembC. The latter was a PCR product created with a forward primer (embC-f, as above), including an NdeI site, and a reverse primer (Nco-r279 5′-ACG GGC CAT GGT CAG GAT GTA GCC GTC GGC GGC CGT GTT GGC G-3′ or Nco-r280 5′-ACG GGC CAT GGT CAG GAT GTA GCC GCC GTC GGC CGT GTT GGC G-3′), including an NcoI site (underlined), and the mutation corresponding to D279A or D280G (in boldface). Amino acid properties and M. smegmatis codon usage (www.kazusa.or.jp/codon) were taken into account while selecting the base substitution. The final pVE constructs, with or without point mutations in msembC, were verified by DNA sequencing. All primers were synthesized by Invitrogen, and Escherichia coli DH5α (Invitrogen) was the cloning host for pGEM and pVV16 based vectors.Table IRecombinant strains of M. smegmatis mc2155 used in this studya pVEWT = pVV16 + msembC.

All M. smegmatis strains, except the wild type, were grown in medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml hygromycin.Extraction of LAM and LM—Cells harvested from 2-liter lots of liquid medium in late log phase were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lyophilized. Dried cells were delipidated with organic solvents (23Khoo K.H. Douglas E. Azadi P. Inamine J.M. Besra G.S. Mikusova K. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol.

The resulting suspension was refluxed in 50% ethanol three times for 2 h each time. The combined supernatants gained after centrifugation were evaporated and digested with 1 mg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen). After dialysis, aliquots of the aqueous solution were further purified by column chromatography or analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In order to obtain radiolabeled LAM, strains were cultivated in Sauton medium supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80 and harvested at A600 of 0.8. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of Sauton medium supplemented with [14C]glucose (10 μCi/ml; 310 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h while mixing every 30 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lyophilized. Extraction and deacylation of LAM and LM were performed as described (24Mikusova K. Slayden R.A. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), except for phenol extraction which was replaced by proteinase K digestion and dialysis.Size Exclusion Chromatography, Gel Electrophoresis, and Immunoblotting—A two-step purification protocol was performed to fractionate LAM and LM, following that of Khoo et al. (23Khoo K.H. Douglas E. Azadi P. Inamine J.M. Besra G.S. Mikusova K. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol.

Fractions containing LAM and LM were monitored by PAGE and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining or by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody CS-35, as described previously (25Prinzis S.

A Bio-Gel P-100 (Bio-Rad) size exclusion column, 1 × 120 cm, equilibrated with 50 mm acetic acid, was applied for separation of deacylated LAM and LM.Monosaccharide Composition and Linkage Analysis—Sugar composition of selected fractions from the P-100 column was determined after hydrolysis with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 120 °C. Pentoses and hexoses were separated on 20-cm cellulose TLC plates (Merck) developed four times in formic acid/butanone/tert-butanol/water (15:30:40: 15, v/v) and exposed for 48 h to a general purpose phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences). Nonradiolabeled sugar references were detected by staining with phthalic acid (27Tuncer M. Ball A.S. Folia Microbiol. 2003; 48: 168-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alditol acetates were prepared as described (28McNeil M. Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 215-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography (GC) of alditol acetates was performed on an HP Gas Chromatography model 5890 fitted with an SP 2380 column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter; Supelco) at an initial temperature of 50 °C, held for 1 min, rising to 170 °C at 30 °C/min before increasing to 260 °C at 5 °C/min. The results were compared with reference to known sugars; scyllo-inositol was used as an internal standard. For linkage analysis, polysaccharides were permethylated by the NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide slurry method (29Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and alditol acetates were prepared (28McNeil M. Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 215-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Quantitation was performed by GC/MS (Thermo-Quest GCQ plus (Thermo Electron Corp.)) using selected ion chromatograms. The areas of ions from each component were compared with the corresponding areas generated from a standard with known molar ratios (as determined by GC (30Sweet D.P. Shapiro R.H. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1975; 40: 217-225Crossref Scopus (731) Google Scholar)). Purified LAM products from wild type and complemented strains were incubated with endoarabinanase from Cellulomonas gelida (31McNeil M.R. Robuck K.G. Harter M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) for 15 h at 37 °C. Digested products were analyzed by high pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) as described previously (32Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and compared with references to known oligosaccharides.RESULTSTopology Prediction and Sequence Analysis of the Emb Proteins—Amino acid sequences of the three proteins, EmbA, EmbB, and EmbC, from the four species Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium leprae, M. smegmatis, and M. tuberculosis were analyzed in detail. The size of each of these 12 homologs is around 1100 residues; the overall identity varies between 25 and 28% depending on species, and the conserved residues are evenly distributed along the sequences, supporting earlier suggestions of related functions (9Escuyer V.E. Lety M.A. Torrelles J.B. Khoo K.H. Tang J.B. Rithner C.D. Frehel C. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48854-48862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Zhang N. Torrelles J.B. McNeil M.R. Escuyer V.E. Khoo K.H. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). On the other hand, comparisons of the EmbA, EmbB, and EmbC proteins from within the four Mycobacterium spp. gave identities as high as 65%, suggesting nearly identical functions. Topology prediction programs pointed to integral membrane proteins with the number of transmembrane (TM) spanning domains varying between 11 and 14, depending on the Emb protein and algorithm used. Fig. 1B shows a topology profile of the Emb proteins, exemplified by mtEmbB, based on the TMHMM 2.0 analysis (19Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8870) Google Scholar), which has one of the highest reliability scores in predicting helix bundle membrane proteins (33Melen K. Krogh A. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This algorithm predicted 13 TM helices, in analogous sequence positions, for 10 of the 12 Emb proteins investigated; the remaining two were only slightly divergent. Matching hydrophobicity plots, determined by TMpred (18Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar) and represented by mtEmbB in Fig. 1A, confirmed that similarity of the TM profile extended to all 12 sequences. In particular, TM domains 4 and 5 (Fig. 1B) generally had lower probability scores than the others; however, no constant pattern was found that could distinguish the three Emb protein types in this sequence region. The last four loops predicted to be on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane are short and positively charged, in accordance with the “positive-inside” rule (34von Heijne G. Nature. 1989; 341: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and thus suggesting a topology whereby the ∼400-residue large carboxyl terminus is located on the periplasmic side. The locations of strictly conserved amino acids in the 12 homologs were studied by using the model in Fig. 1B, assuming that all Emb proteins possess the same topology with 13 TM regions. A polarization of conserved residues in the periplasmic loops (31%) was observed, whereas only 11 and 27% were conserved in the cytoplasmic loops and the TM domains, respectively.Fig. 1Topology models of Emb proteins and PCPs. The hydrophobicity plot of mtEmbB (A) predicted by TMpred (18Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar) shows 13 labeled hydrophobic regions. The same pattern was predicted for 11 other Emb proteins from various Mycobacterium spp. The topology model for mtEmbB, with 1098 amino acids (B), predicted by TMHMM 2.0 (19Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8870) Google Scholar), was also applicable to the others. The most significant TM domains are in black and the two less significant domains are in gray. Conserved residues in motifs described in Fig. 2 are shown in the GT-C motif (I) and the Pro motif (II). The methionine (Met306 in mtEmbB), downstream from the two aspartic acids in the GT-C motif, is frequently mutated in EMB-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis (5Telenti A. Philipp W.J. Sreevatsan S. Bernasconi C. Stockbauer K.E. Wieles B. Musser J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). C50-P-Araf, the donor of d-Araf, and the EMB icons symbolize a competing event that may occur in the EMB resistance determining region. The topology for PCP proteins (C) has been established (49Morona R. Van den B.L. Manning P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the described proline-rich motif is located just upstream of the second TM region in these proteins. The cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain differs in size and functional feature among the PCP proteins (36Morona R. Van den B.L. Daniels C. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 47Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The difficulty in finding proteins in the data bases with an overall high homology to the Emb proteins did not rule out the possibility of the existence of short segments or motifs common to other membrane proteins of prokaryote or eukaryote origin. Scanning for many motifs, conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures,” identified only a few with potential significance. Of particular interest were functional motifs shared with proteins involved in polymerization of polysaccharides and a superfamily of integral membrane glycosyltransferases. In the former case, all Emb proteins from mycobacteria contained the conserved motif (YX6PX5P) with homology to the “proline-rich motif” of several bacterial cytoplasmic membrane proteins (Fig. 2B) (12Daniels C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Becker A. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 395-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bastin D.A. Stevenson G. Brown P.K. Haase A. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) that have collectively been called polysaccharide co-polymerases (PCPs) (36Morona R. Van den B.L. Daniels C. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The function of PCP proteins and the proline-rich motif itself is not fully understood, but there are strong indications of involvement in the regulation of polysaccharide biosynthesis. Characteristics of PCPs are a large periplasmic segment between two TM regions located close to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends with the proline-rich motif situated just upstream of the second TM domain (Fig. 1C). The latter TM domain is commonly rich in glycines (36Morona R. Van den B.L. Daniels C. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the case of the Emb proteins, the predicted Pro motif is located in a shorter periplasmic loop, between TM helices 11 and 12 (Fig. 1B), and the typical numerous glycines are missing. This mycobacterial version of the proline-rich motif is contained within a larger consensus motif NGW(F/W)YVX3GVP(F/W)X4(P/I) in Mycobacterium and Corynebacterium spp. Fig. 2B shows sequence alignments of proteins in which the proline-rich motif has been described versus selected Emb proteins. The two strictly conserved Pro, which are typical for this motif, were found in all mycobacterial Emb proteins, whereas the second Pro is missing in the orthologs from corynebacterial species (compare Pro635 and Pro641 in msEmbC versus the corresponding positions in cdEmb, ceEmb, and cgEmb; Fig. 2B). The alignment also shows that among the Emb proteins themselves there is high homology within this motif and especially upstream of the first conserved Pro. Furthermore, predicted secondary structure analysis of the sequences in Fig. 2B suggests other common features, where two α-helices are flanking the motif and the presence of a β-strand is predicted about seven residues upstream of the first Pro. The α-helix downstream of the motif is always predicted to be a TM domain in these proteins. Besides the two Pro, a Tyr is also conserved among the Wzz and the Emb proteins. This residue (Tyr628 in msEmbC) is loc"
https://openalex.org/W2043350083,"Lipid accumulation by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) is a feature of atherosclerotic plaques. In this study we describe two mechanisms whereby human VSMC foam cell formation is driven by de novo synthesis of fatty acids leading to triacylglycerol accumulation in intracellular vacuoles, a process distinct from serum lipoprotein uptake. VSMC cultured in adipogenic differentiation medium accumulated lipids and were induced to express the adipocyte marker genes adipsin, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, C/EBPα, PPARγ, and leptin. However, complete adipocyte differentiation was not observed as numerous genes present in mature adipocytes were not detected, and the phenotype was reversible. The rate of lipid accumulation was not affected by PPARγ agonists, but screening for the effects of other nuclear receptor agonists showed that activation of the liver X receptors (LXR) dramatically promoted lipid accumulation in VSMC. Both LXRα and LXRβ were present in VSMC, and their activation with TO901317 resulted in induction of the lipogenic genes fatty acid synthetase, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1c), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase. 27-Hydroxycholesterol, an abundant oxysterol synthesized by VSMC acted as an LXR antagonist and, therefore, may have a protective role in preventing foam cell formation. Immunohistochemistry showed that VSMC within atherosclerotic plaques express adipogenic and lipogenic markers, suggesting these pathways are present in vivo. Moreover, the development of an adipogenic phenotype in VSMC is consistent with their known phenotypic plasticity and may contribute to their dysfunction in atherosclerotic plaques and, thus, impinge on plaque growth and stability."
https://openalex.org/W2054403078,"Mirk/dyrk1B is a member of the dyrk/minibrain family of serine/threonine kinases that mediate the transition from growth to differentiation in lower eukaryotes and mammals. Depletion of endogenous Mirk from C2C12 myoblasts by RNA interference blocks skeletal muscle differentiation (Deng, X., Ewton, D., Pawlikowski, B., Maimone, M., and Friedman, E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 41347-41354). We now demonstrate that knockdown of Mirk blocks transcription of the muscle regulatory factor myogenin. Co-expression of Mirk with MEF2C, but not MyoD or Myf5, enhanced activation of the myogenin promoter in a Mirk kinase-dependent manner. Mirk activated MEF2 not through direct phosphorylation of MEF2 but by phosphorylation of its inhibitors, the class II histone deacetylases (HDACs). MEF2 is sequestered by class II HDACs such as HDAC5 and MEF2-interacting transcriptional repressor (MITR). Mirk antagonized the inhibition of MEF2C by MITR, whereas kinase-inactive Mirk was ineffective. Mirk phosphorylates class II HDACs at a conserved site within the nuclear localization region, reducing their nuclear accumulation in a dose-dependent and kinase-dependent manner. Moreover, less mutant MITR phosphomimetic at the Mirk phosphorylation site localized in the nucleus than wild-type MITR. Regulation of class II HDACs occurs by multiple mechanisms. Others have shown that calcium signaling leads to phosphorylation of HDACs at 14-3-3-binding sites, blocking their association with MEF2 within the nucleus. Mirk provides another level of regulation. Mirk is induced within the initial 24 h of myogenic differentiation and enables MEF2 to transcribe the myogenin gene by decreasing the nuclear accumulation of class II HDACs.

In addition, Mirk is activated through the stress signaling pathway by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MKK3 (6Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mirk is strongly transcriptionally up-regulated under conditions of mitogen deprivation, such as occurs when myoblasts are transferred from growth to differentiation medium. In particular when IGF-1 is eliminated (2Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar, 3Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol.

Whereas Mirk protein levels are very low in dividing myoblasts, they are increased at least 10-fold when myoblasts commit to terminal differentiation and are maintained at elevated levels in mature muscle cells (3Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This unusual cluster of characteristics suggests the following model. Mirk levels increase under conditions favorable for terminal differentiation when myoblasts arrest in G0; Mirk aids in maintaining G0 arrest, and elevated amounts of Mirk protein are further activated by cellular stresses to mediate myoblast differentiation. In this report we have investigated whether Mirk mediates myoblast differentiation solely by maintaining G0 arrest or whether Mirk has an additional role as a transcriptional activator in muscle differentiation. Mirk is also found in normal hepatocytes, and we have shown (6Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that Mirk activates the hepatocyte transcription factor HNF1α by phosphorylation. In the myoblast system, depletion of Mirk by RNA interference strongly blocked expression of the myogenic regulatory factor myogenin (3Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that Mirk might control myogenin expression. In the current study, we demonstrate that Mirk functions as a transcriptional activator of MEF2C, a known mediator of myogenin expression, by decreasing the nuclear concentration of class II HDACs that function as MEF2C inhibitors. Mirk phosphorylates these HDACs at a conserved serine within their nuclear localization signal. Small Interfering RNA (RNAi) to Mirk—The RNAi sequence to Mirk, GACCTACAAGCACATCATT, was inserted into the pSilencer plasmid (Ambion) (3Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol.

C2C12 cells were transfected with a 10 to 1 ratio (μg/μg) of RNAi plasmid to EGFP selection plasmid in serum-free medium and then isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for EGFP by using a BD Biosciences FACSVantage SE cell sorter. Affymetrix Gene Chips—The MOE430A chip (mouse expression) was utilized. The chips contain 22,690 unique probe identifier oligonucleotide sequence sets. Data were analyzed by using the Microarray Suite 4.0 and, for a more stringent program, the Robust Multi-Chip Analysis program (Gene Traffic, Iobion) to identify genes exhibiting at least a 2-fold reduction, comparing the RNA populations treated with RNAi to Mirk to those treated with the vector control. 12,433 probe sets were identified in the RNAi population and 12,718 in the vector control. 193 transcripts were decreased, and 86 transcripts were increased. Materials—Antibodies to myogenin, MEF2C, MyoD, and β-tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody to the N terminus of HDAC9 from ABGENT was used to detect MITR. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to a unique sequence at the C terminus of Mirk was raised as described (2Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar).

Alexa Fluor 594 (highly cross-adsorbed) secondary antibody conjugates were purchased from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture—C2C12 mouse myoblasts and NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the ATCC and cultured according to their recommendations. C2C12 cells were maintained in growth medium (GM; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4 mm l-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter glucose, containing 20% fetal bovine serum) and induced to undergo differentiation by switching to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4 mm l-glutamine, 4.5g/liter glucose, containing 7% bovine calf serum. Cells were used for experiments only from passages 3 to 10 from our frozen stocks. Plasmids—Plasmids encoding either wild-type or kinase-inactive YF Mirk had been generated previously (2Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse myogenin promoter reporter construct mgnp224-luciferase (-184 to +48 from the start site) and the myogenin expression plasmid in pEMSV were from S. J. Tapscott, Fred Hutchison Cancer Center. Expression plasmids for human MEF2C and MEF2D in pCDNA1 and mouse MyoD in pEMSV, and GST-HDAC5 amino acids 1-283, were the gifts of E. N. Olson, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The MITR expression plasmid was from D. Sparrow, The National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK. The Myf5 expression plasmid in pEMSV was from B. Winter, Technische Universitat Braunschweig. 3xMEF2-luciferase and gal4-luciferase were the kind gifts of Dr. Zhenguo Wu, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Wild-type HDAC5 (pGEX-HDAC5-1-283) and wild-type MITR were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis (Gene-Editor system, Promega). All mutant constructs were sequenced to confirm the mutated sequence. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells were transfected in 12-well plates for 6 h with Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's manual. Transfected cells were lysed with Cell Culture Lysis Reagent and assayed for luciferase activity (relative luciferase unit) with luciferase assay reagent (Promega) in a Turner Designs Luminometer. The same lysates were diluted and assayed for β-galactosidase activity to normalize transfection efficiency. Data shown are the means of triplicate measurements. Cell Fractionation—5 × 105 C2C12 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes overnight and transfected with the indicated constructs. After 24 h, the cells were trypsinized, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 150 μl of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P 8340). The cell suspension was kept on ice for 10 min with occasional vortexing and monitored microscopically until >90% of the cells were lysed. The nuclei were pelleted at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min to remove any unlysed cells. The nuclear pellet was washed with 300 μl of Buffer A without Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were solubilized in hot Laemmli sample buffer before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Localization of MITR Constructs—C2C12 myoblasts were plated overnight in Lab-Tek 2-well chamber slides (1 × 105 cells per well) and then transfected with FLAG-MITR (1 μg of plasmid DNA) using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 24 h of expression in GM, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS (PBST) for 5 min, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBST for 30 min. The cells were incubated for 45 min with a 1:1000 dilution of either rabbit antibody to the N terminus of HDAC-9 or murine monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope, each diluted in 10% normal goat serum in PBST. After three PBS washes, the cells were incubated for 30 min with a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-mouse antibody or goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were detected by incubation for 5 min with a 2 ng/ml solution of 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride in PBST. Slides were mounted with Biomedia Gel/Mount. Monochrome fluorescence images were obtained at ×400 using a Diagnostic Instruments SPOT RT camera mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E50i fluorescent microscope. SPOT RT software version 4.09 was used to pseudocolor and merge the images. Final figures were arranged using Adobe Photoshop version 7.0. Northern Analysis for Myogenin mRNA—Total RNA was prepared by the RNeasy protocol (Qiagen) and analyzed for mRNA composition by microarray analysis. 4 μg of the remaining total RNA from each cell lysate was electrophoresed in a 1.1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membranes by downward capillary transfer, and cross-linked by baking in an oven. The membranes were hybridized to a 32P-labeled 1-kb EcoRI fragment of the myogenin cDNA construct. The probes were labeled with 32P by random priming (Promega). The blot was hybridized overnight at 68 °C with at least 107 cpm of the labeled probe, washed twice at room temperature for 15 min with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and then washed for 20 min at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and autoradiographed. In Vitro Kinase Assay—GST-Mirk or GST-YF-Mirk preparations were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C with 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), containing 50 μm cold ATP plus 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of purified recombinant GST-HDAC5 protein as substrate, and then analyzed by PAGE and autoradiography. Glutathione S-Transferase Fusion Proteins—Mirk and YF-Mirk were subcloned into the pGEX-6P1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), and the HDAC5 constructs were subcloned into the pGEX 4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), and both were expressed and purified as described. 2S. Mercer, D. Ewton, S. Lim, T. Mazur, and E. Friedman, submitted for publication. Metabolic Labeling—C2C12 cells were incubated for 6 h in serum-free low phosphate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (9:1 ratio phosphate-free medium/normal medium) with 150 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate/2 ml of medium. Immunodetection—Following treatment as indicated and washing two times with PBS, cells were lysed in hot SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol), boiled for 5 min, and vortexed vigorously. Protein determinations were made using Coomassie protein assay reagent from Pierce. Depending upon the experiment, 30-50 μg of cell lysate were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation on SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature with primary antibody in TBST buffer, 3% milk, and proteins were subsequently detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Band Analysis—Immunoblots were scanned using a Lacie Silver-scanner, and densitometry was performed using the IP Lab Gel program (Scanalytics). Use of Small Interfering RNA to Mirk Substantially Decreased the Levels of Myogenin mRNA and Protein in C2C12 Myoblasts—In our recent study (3Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we utilized RNAi to demonstrate that Mirk helps to mediate skeletal muscle cell differentiation. Western blotting analysis showed that knockdown of endogenous Mirk led to depletion of other proteins that mediate the myotube phenotype. In the current study we used microarray analysis to identify the genes down-regulated when Mirk levels were reduced by RNA interference. Two RNA populations were compared by microarray analysis as follows: RNA from differentiating C2C12 myoblasts in which Mirk was induced as a natural result of differentiation, and RNA from myoblasts cultured under the same conditions but with endogenous Mirk depleted by RNAi. Cells expressing RNAi were selected by cell sorting for the co-transfected EGFP marker gene, with cells transfected with vector DNA serving as the control. The sorted C2C12 cells were then plated for 1 day and then switched to differentiation medium for 1 day to induce Mirk (vector control, Vc cells) or to allow the RNAi to deplete endogenous Mirk (si cells). Western blotting confirmed that endogenous Mirk levels were decreased 60-fold by RNA interference (Fig. 1A). The MOE430A Affymetrix chip (mouse expression) was utilized for microarray analysis of the RNA populations from Mirk-depleted and control cells. The chips contain 22,690 unique probe identifier oligonucleotide sequence sets. Data were analyzed using the Microarray Suite 4.0 and, a more stringent program, the Robust Multi-Chip Analysis program (Gene Traffic, Iobion) to identify genes exhibiting at least a 2-fold reduction when the mRNA population from the RNAi-treated cells was compared with the mRNA population from vector control-treated cells. 12,433 probe sets were identified in the RNAi population and 12,718 in the vector control. 193 transcripts were decreased, and 86 transcripts were increased. The genes whose expression was most strongly reduced when Mirk was depleted by RNAi are shown in Table I.Table IGenes down-regulated by RNAi to Mirk-Fold changeUniGene name-11.53Collagenous repeat-containing sequence, skeletal development protein-9.99H19 fetal liver mRNA, oct-binding maintenance sequence for unmethylated DNA-8.63Myosin light chain, phosphorylatable, fast skeletal muscle-7.57Myogenin-7.40Myosin light chain, alkali, fast skeletal muscle-6.57Troponin C, fast skeletal-6.24Actin, α1, skeletal muscle-5.59Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2-5.49Actin, α, cardiac-4.87Osteoglycin-4.58Placenta-specific 8-4.43Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus A-4.32Troponin C, cardiac/slow skeletal-4.17Actinin α3-4.04Serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor, clade B (ovalbumin), member 1a-4.02CD80 antigen-4.00Inhibitor of DNA binding 3-3.96Calcium channel, voltage-dependent, γ subunit 1-3.78Strathmin-like 2-3.68Titin-3.67Myosin, light polypeptide 9, regulatory-3.62Biglycan-3.47IGF-BP7-3.43Early growth response 1 (EGR1)-3.38Enolase 3, β muscle-3.36Dynein, cytoplasmic, intermediate chain I-3.35SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin d-3.31Granzyme E-3.29Cadherin 15-2.96Myomesin 2-2.93Troponin T1, skeletal slow-2.82Thioredoxin-interacting protein-2.81IGF-BP5-2.76Sarcoglycan, β (43-kDa dystrophin-associated glycoprotein) Open table in a new tab Most of the genes reduced by knockdown of endogenous Mirk by RNA interference were skeletal muscle differentiation genes. None of the Id family of differentiation inhibitor genes was increased when Mirk was depleted (Table II). One of the genes reduced most in expression was myogenin, whose expression was reduced 7.5-fold. Northern blotting confirmed the microarray analysis. Myogenin mRNA was undetectable by Northern blotting, although similar levels of 18 S and 28 S rRNAs were found in the RNA preparations (Fig. 1B). As an additional control, cyclin D1 mRNA levels were measured in the Northern blots and were identical in control and RNA interference samples (data not shown). Therefore, Mirk controls the transcription of myogenin. Our prior study supports the hypothesis that Mirk mediates expression of myogenin. Myogenin and Mirk are induced at the protein level with similar kinetics during the initial differentiation of primary cultured murine hindlimb muscle satellite cells, C2C12 cells, and L6 rat myoblasts placed in differentiation medium (3Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depletion of Mirk by RNAi led to a 13-fold reduction in myogenin protein levels (Fig. 1A), and overexpression of Mirk induced a more rapid appearance of myogenin (3Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

Myf5 and MyoD are essential for establishing the myogenic lineage, before Mirk is induced through RhoA action at the onset of differentiation (3Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Myogenin is up-regulated later during the process of terminal differentiation. Both an E box (CANNTG) and an MEF2-binding site within the myogenin promoter are essential for myogenin transcription. The transcription factors MyoD, MEF-2, Myf5, and the ubiquitous E box proteins have been implicated in myogenin regulation (13Edmondson D. Cheng T. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14Malik S. Huang C. Schmidt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Friday B. Mitchell P. Kegley K. Pavlath G. Differentiation. 2003; 71: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and could serve as potential Mirk substrates. The muscle regulatory factor Myf-5 is co-expressed with MyoD only in dividing myoblasts but is lost within 12 h of the start of differentiation and is not seen in cells expressing myogenin, indicating that MyoD, not Myf-5, mediates myogenin transcription (16Kitzmann M. Carnac G. Vandromme M. Primig M. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 142: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We first determined whether endogenous Mirk could up-regulate myogenin expression by transfecting a myogenin promoter reporter construct into growing C2C12 myoblasts. The cells were then switched to differentiation medium for 24 h to induce the up-regulation of Mirk (3Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The cells were not sorted in this experiment, and the transfection efficiency was at best 30%, so some background was detected due to the residual endogenous Mirk activity. However, a clear difference was observed. The myogenin promoter reporter construct was activated 4-fold in differentiating C2C12 cells that had up-regulated endogenous Mirk expression as part of their differentiation program (Fig. 2). However, when the myogenin reporter construct was co-transfected with an expression plasmid for RNAi to Mirk to knockdown endogenous Mirk levels and cells were then cultured in differentiation medium, little increase in myogenin reporter activity was observed. Therefore, reduction of endogenous Mirk levels blocked the activation of the myogenin promoter. Mirk Activates a Myogenin Reporter Construct in a Kinase-dependent Manner in Concert with MEF2C but Not MyoD or Myf5—Mirk activates the transcription factor HNF1α and phosphorylates HNF1α at a residue within its CBP-binding domain (6Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We postulated that Mirk would also phosphorylate, and thus activate, one of the transcription factors that mediate transcription of the myogenin gene. We co-transfected a myogenin promoter reporter construct together with expression plasmids for either Mirk, kinase-inactive YF-Mirk, or the vector, and we then performed parallel experiments with the Mirk constructs in the presence of expression constructs for MEF2C, MEF2D, MyoD, Myf5, or combinations. Mirk activated the myogenin promoter reporter construct about 2-fold, whereas YF-Mirk had no effect (Fig. 3A, vector lanes). When either MEF2C or MEF2D were co-expressed with wild-type Mirk, there was a further 2-fold increase in reporter activity. MEF2D, and to a lesser extent MEF2C, increased myogenin reporter expression when co-expressed with kinase-inactive YF-Mirk, probably because each factor complexed with endogenous transcription factors. However, MEF2C clearly activated the myogenin reporter in a Mirk kinase-dependent manner. In contrast, MyoD increased the activity of the myogenin reporter construct about 10-fold, but expression of Mirk did not alter this activation (Fig. 3B). When MyoD and MEF2C were co-expressed, the stimulatory effect of Mirk was seen again (Fig. 3C). As in the case with MyoD, Myf5 increased the activity of the myogenin reporter in a Mirk-independent manner (Fig. 3D). However, when MEF2C was co-expressed with Myf5, the large activation of the myogenin reporter that was seen was further enhanced by expression of wild-type Mirk but not kinase-inactive Mirk. These data, taken together, demonstrated that Mirk functioned by activating MEF2C. Mirk Does Not Directly Activate MEF2C by Phosphorylation—In an earlier study, we had found that Mirk activate"

The RAS association domain family protein 1 (RASSF1) 1The abbreviations used are: RASSF1, RAS association domain family protein 1; APC, anaphase-promoting complex; RNAi, RNA interference; RABP1, RASSF1A-binding protein 1; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. gene is implicated as a tumor suppressor by the observations that it is frequently silenced in a wide range of tumors as a result of hypermethylation of a CpG island within its promoter (1Dammann R.

Two major isoforms of RASSF1, A and C, are produced from the human RASSF1 gene on chromosome 3p21.3 (1Dammann R. Li C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat.

RASSF1A contains a C1 (cysteine-rich, diacylglycerol binding) domain in its NH2-terminal region and an RAS association domain in its COOH-terminal region, whereas RASSF1C also contains the RAS association domain but possesses a distinct 50-amino acid sequence in place of the C1 domain. RASSF1 proteins are thought to participate in regulation of the cell cycle and cell death given that their ectopic expression promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (7Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S.

Coexpression of RASSF1C thus enhances the induction of apoptosis by activated RAS, and association of RASSF1A with mammalian STE20-like kinase 1 (MST1) appears to contribute to apoptotic signaling (7Khokhlatchev A.

RASSF1A blocks cell cycle progression at the G1-S transition by inhibiting the accumulation of cyclin D and promotes arrest at G1 by binding to p120E4F (11Shivakumar L. Minna J. Sakamaki T.

RASSF1A also associates with and stabilizes microtubules, suggesting that it plays a role in microtubule dynamics (13Liu L. Tommasi S. Lee D.H. Dammann R. Pfeifer G.P.

The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is a ubiquitin ligase that specifically targets mitotic cyclins A and B for degradation and thereby allows mitotic progression (15King R.W. Deshaies R.J.

We have recently shown that RASSF1A is required for normal mitotic progression as a result of its inhibition of APC activity during mitosis (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 26Song M.S. Lim D.S. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 574-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RASSF1A thus binds to Cdc20 that is localized on the mitotic spindle and at the spindle poles during prometaphase and thereby inhibits its ability to promote the destruction of mitotic cyclins and subsequent mitotic progression. This role of RASSF1A in APC regulation is independent both of the Mad2-dependent spindle checkpoint machinery and of the Emi1-Cdc20 inhibitory complex. Depletion of RASSF1A by RNA interference (RNAi) accelerates mitotic progression as a result of premature APC activation. We have now examined further the function of RASSF1A in mitotic regulation and identified, with the use of a yeast two-hybrid screen, a centrosomal protein, designated RASSF1A binding protein 1 (RABP1), that interacts with RASSF1A. We further demonstrated that RABP1 plays an important role in the recruitment of RASSF1A to spindle poles and in the subsequent RASSF1A-mediated regulation of the APC in mitosis. Plasmids and Constructs—For construction of the bait plasmid pGBKT7-RASSF1A, the full-length human RASSF1A cDNA was released from pSG5 (Stratagene) by digestion with BamHI and EcoRI and then cloned in-frame into the yeast vector pGBKT7 (Clontech). The human cDNAs for RASSF1A or RABP1 were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pSG5 for expression of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-, FLAG epitope-, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-, or red fluorescent protein-tagged proteins. The DNA fragments encoding RABP1 deletion mutants (N1, N2, N3, and N4) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pSG5 for expression of FLAG-tagged proteins. For generation of vectors for RABP1 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), the annealed oligonucleotides containing RABP1 cDNA sequences (RABP1–1 sense, 5′-GACTGAGAAAGAAGCCAAG-3′; RABP1–2 sense, 5′-CGCAAGACTGAGAAAGAAG-3′) were ligated into pSUPER (Oligoengine) that had been digested with BglII and HindIII. RASSF1A siRNAs were described previously (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (27Lim D.S. Kirsch D.G. Canman C.E. Ahn J.H. Ziv Y. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10146-10151Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In brief, yeast strain AH109 transformed with pGBKT7-RASSF1A was mated with strain Y187 that had been transformed with a Matchmaker human testis cDNA library (Clontech). A total of 5 × 106 yeast colonies was screened of which 30 survived in selective medium and were positive for β-galactosidase expression. Clones were rescued and reintroduced into yeast to confirm positive interactions. For deletion analysis, double transformants of HF7c cells were grown in selective medium, and β-galactosidase activity was determined with o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactoside as substrate. Cell Culture and Transfection—293T, NCI-H23, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For thymidine block and release experiments, cells were incubated for 16 h with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma), washed, and then incubated in medium without thymidine. Unless indicated otherwise, 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids by CaCl2 precipitation, and NCI-H23 and HeLa cells were transfected with the use of the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies to human RABP1 were generated in rabbits by injection with a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 528–828 of RABP1. Mouse and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to RASSF1A were generated as described previously (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used in the present study included mouse monoclonal antibodies to HA (Roche Applied Science); to FLAG, to β-tubulin, or to γ-tubulin (Sigma); or to cyclin B, to cyclin D, or to Cdc20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to HA, to Chk2, to GFP, to Cdc20, or to cyclin A were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells grown on chamber slides (LabTakII, Nunc) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in ice-cold methanol, washed again with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 5% normal goat serum (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then exposed consecutively to primary antibodies and to rhodamine- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit or mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Slides were mounted in medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and imaged either with an Olympus microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca charge-coupled device camera or with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad CLSM 1024). Data were processed with Adobe Photoshop 5.5 software. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were cotransfected with pcDNA-CD4 (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and Flag-RABP1 vectors at a mass ratio of 1:10, collected at various times after transfection, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse antibodies to CD4 (Calbiochem). They were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml) (Sigma), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with RNase A (20 μg/ml) (Roche Applied Science). The DNA content of the cells was then evaluated by flow cytometry with a FACScan instrument (BD Biosciences). Linear red fluorescence (FL2) in green (CD4-expressing) cells was analyzed. The mitotic index and mitotic stage of cells expressing Flag-RABP1 were determined by immunostaining with antibodies to β-tubulin and to FLAG. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) with antibodies coupled either to Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or to protein G-agarose (Oncogene). The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and then subjected to immunoblot analysis. Centrosome Isolation—A centrosome fraction was prepared as described previously (28Hsu L.C. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12983-12988Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). HeLa cells in the exponential phase of growth were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with cytochalasin D (1 μg/ml) and 0.2 μm nocodazole before lysis in a solution containing 1 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors. Swollen nuclei and chromatin aggregates were removed by centrifugation of the lysate at 2500 × g for 10 min. The Hepes concentration of the supernatant was adjusted to 10 mm, DNase I (Promega) was added to a concentration of 2 units/ml, and the mixture was then incubated for 30 min on ice before underlaying with a solution containing 60% (w/w) sucrose, 10 mm Pipes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Centrosomes were sedimented into the sucrose cushion by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min and then subjected to immunoblot analysis. Identification of RABP1 as a Protein That Binds RASSF1A—To explore the mechanism by which RASSF1A regulates the cell cycle, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for proteins that interact with RASSF1A. With full-length RASSF1A as the bait, we screened a human testis cDNA library and identified 30 positive clones, seven of which encoded COOH-terminal fragments of the hypothetical protein C19ORF5. The full-length protein, which we now designate RABP1, has a calculated molecular size of ∼130 kDa and manifests substantial sequence similarity to microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1A and MAP1B, the MAP domains of which are thought to regulate microtubule dynamics (29Drewes G. Ebneth A. Mandelkow E.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To define the region of RABP1 responsible for interaction with RASSF1A, we constructed four deletion mutants of RABP1 fused with the DNA binding domain of Gal4 and tested them for their ability to bind to RASSF1A in the yeast two-hybrid assay. The regions containing either of the two MAP domains (amino acids 209–500 or 798–1059) of RABP1 were sufficient for interaction with RASSF1A (Fig. 1A). Similarly a COOH-terminal region of RASSF1A containing the RAS association domain (amino acids 120–340) was sufficient for interaction with RABP1 (Fig. 1B). To examine the interaction between RASSF1A and RABP1 in mammalian cells, we transiently cotransfected 293T cells with expression vectors for HA-tagged RASSF1A and FLAG-tagged RABP1 and subjected lysates of the transfected cells to co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. HA-RASSF1A coprecipitated with Flag-RABP1 from the cell lysates (Fig. 1C). We also confirmed that the COOH-terminal region of RASSF1A containing the RAS association domain was sufficient for interaction with Flag-RABP1 in these cells (Fig. 1D). Immunofluorescence analysis also revealed that Flag-RABP1 colocalized with HA-RASSF1A at microtubules during interphase and at spindle poles during mitosis in HeLa cells (data not shown). RABP1 Is a Centrosomal Protein—We next generated polyclonal antibodies to a fragment of RABP1 comprising amino acids 528–828. These antibodies specifically recognized both the endogenous protein (∼130 kDa) and exogenous Flag-RABP1 in NCI-H23 cells (Fig. 2A). With the use of these antibodies, we investigated whether the expression of RABP1 is cell cycle-dependent. The abundance of endogenous RABP1 in HeLa cells was relatively constant throughout cell cycle progression (data not shown). We next assessed the interaction between endogenous RABP1 and RASSF1A in HeLa cells. Endogenous RASSF1A was indeed precipitated by the antibodies to RABP1 but not by normal rabbit IgG (Fig. 2A). However, given that none of the available antibodies to RASSF1A are able to immunoprecipitate RASSF1A, we could not perform the inverse co-immunoprecipitation experiment. We then examined the subcellular distribution of endogenous RABP1 in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence analysis with the antibodies to RABP1. A substantial proportion of endogenous RABP1 was localized to the centrosome, as revealed by staining with antibodies to γ-tubulin, during both interphase and mitosis (Fig. 2B). To confirm that RABP1 is a centrosome-associated protein, we isolated a centrosome-enriched fraction from HeLa cells (28Hsu L.C. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12983-12988Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and subjected it to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to RABP1. A substantial proportion of cellular RABP1 was present in the centrosome fraction, whereas the nuclear protein Chk2 was not detected in this fraction (Fig. 2B). We further examined the association of RABP1 with RASSF1A in HeLa cells by indirect immunostaining. Endogenous RABP1 colocalized with endogenous RASSF1A at the centrosome during both interphase and mitosis (Fig. 2C), indicating that the two proteins interact throughout the cell cycle. In addition, both GFP-tagged RABP1 and red fluorescent protein-tagged RASSF1A in transiently transfected cells localized to the centrosome throughout the cell cycle (data not shown). These results thus demonstrate that the newly identified centrosomal protein RABP1 associates with RASSF1A in vivo. Given that the MAP domains of RABP1 were shown to be responsible for binding to RASSF1A, we tested whether these domains are also required for the localization of RABP1 to the centrosome throughout the cell cycle. Immunostaining of transfected HeLa cells with antibodies to FLAG and to γ-tubulin revealed that FLAG-tagged deletion mutants of RABP1 that contain either of the two MAP domains (RABP1-N2 and RABP1-N4) localized to the centrosome, whereas those that did not contain these domains (RABP1-N1 and RABP1-N3) did not (Fig. 2D). Either of the MAP domains of RABP1 thus appears sufficient for localization to the centrosome as well as for interaction with RASSF1A. RASSF1A-dependent Mitotic Arrest and Stabilization of Mitotic Cyclins Induced by Overexpression of RABP1—Given that we had previously shown that overexpression of RASSF1A induces stabilization of mitotic cyclins and mitotic arrest at prometaphase by inhibiting APC-Cdc20 activity, we next examined the effects of RABP1 overexpression on the cell cycle. Flow cytometric analysis of HeLa cells transiently cotransfected with vectors for Flag-RABP1 and CD4 (surface marker) revealed that overexpression of RABP1 induced G2-M arrest (Fig. 3A). Immunostaining with antibodies to β-tubulin and to FLAG revealed that overexpression of RABP1 markedly increased the mitotic index of cells and that most RABP1-overexpressing cells were in prometaphase (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of RABP1 in HeLa cells also increased the abundance of cyclins A and B in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B), consistent with cell cycle arrest at prometaphase. In contrast, RABP1 overexpression did not increase the level of cyclin D and actually reduced its abundance, probably as a result of the mitotic arrest induced by RABP1, thus indicating that RABP1 specifically affects the concentration of mitotic cyclins. Consistent with this conclusion, Cdc2 activity was also augmented in a concentration-dependent manner by overexpression of RABP1 (Fig. 3B). We determined the duration of the mitotic arrest induced by RABP1 overexpression in HeLa cells synchronized by the double thymidine block protocol (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Whereas the amounts of cyclins A and B in control cells were greatly reduced by 10 h after release from the block, the accumulation of cyclins A and B apparent in RABP1-overexpressing cells was maintained for more than 14 h after release (Fig. 3C). These results thus indicated that overexpression of RABP1 induces an early mitotic arrest that is accompanied by accumulation of cyclins A and B. Given that RABP1 interacts with RASSF1A and that the effects of RABP1 overexpression, including early mitotic arrest and accumulation of mitotic cyclins, are similar to those apparent in cells overexpressing RASSF1A (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), we then tested whether RASSF1A contributes to the mitotic arrest induced by RABP1. Overexpression of RABP1 failed to induce either mitotic arrest or accumulation of cyclins A and B in HeLa cells depleted of RASSF1A by RNAi (Fig. 3D). Given that RASSF1A binds to Cdc20 and inhibits APC-Cdc20 activity, we then examined the effect of RABP1 overexpression on the level of association between RASSF1A and Cdc20. The extent of the interaction between RASSF1A and Cdc20 was increased in cells overexpressing RABP1 compared with that apparent in control cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the induction of mitotic arrest by RABP1 is likely due to an increased level of association between RASSF1A and Cdc20. Together these results indicate that both the mitotic arrest and accumulation of mitotic cyclins induced by ectopic expression of RABP1 are dependent on RASSF1A-mediated inhibition of APC-Cdc20 activity. Mislocalization of RASSF1A and Its Dissociation from Cdc20 Induced by Depletion of RABP1—Given that each of the two MAP domains of RABP1 is sufficient for its association with RASSF1A (Fig. 1A) and localization to the spindle poles (Fig. 2D), we determined whether RABP1 contributes to RASSF1A localization to the spindle poles during mitosis. We first depleted HeLa cells of endogenous RABP1 by RNAi. One of two RABP1-specific siRNAs tested stably suppressed RABP1 expression in these cells (Fig. 4A). We then examined the localization of RASSF1A during mitosis in cells depleted of RABP1. RASSF1A failed to localize to the centrosome during mitosis in RABP1-depleted cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that RABP1 is required for the recruitment of RASSF1A to spindle poles. RASSF1A negatively regulates the activity of APC-Cdc20 through association with Cdc20 on the spindle and at the spindle poles during prometaphase (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H.

We therefore determined whether RABP1 is required for the interaction between RASSF1A and Cdc20. RASSF1A was neither colocalized with Cdc20 on the spindle or at the spindle poles nor co-immunoprecipitated with Cdc20 in RABP1-depleted cells (Fig. 4, B and C). We did not detect a direct interaction between RABP1 and Cdc20 in an in vitro binding assay (data not shown). Together these results thus suggest that the recruitment of RASSF1A to spindle poles by RABP1 is required for the interaction of RASSF1A with Cdc20 during mitosis. Acceleration of Mitotic Progression and Mitotic Abnormalities Induced by RABP1 Depletion—Given that depletion of RASSF1A accelerates mitotic progression as a result of premature APC activation (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), we examined whether the failure of RASSF1A to localize to spindle poles in RABP1-depleted cells also promotes mitotic progression. RABP1-depleted cells (those expressing RABP1 siRNA-1) did not differ from control cells (those transfected with empty vector or with the vector for RABP1 siRNA-2, which does not suppress RABP1 expression) in the kinetics of cell cycle progression from S phase to prometaphase. However, RABP1-depleted cells had already progressed to G1 phase within 12 h after release from thymidine block, whereas control cells did not reach G1 until 14 h (Fig. 5A), indicating that loss of RABP1 indeed accelerated mitotic progression. Consistent with these observations, the destruction of cyclins A and B was initiated prematurely in RABP1-depleted cells (at 12 h after release from thymidine block) compared with that apparent in control cells (Fig. 5B). Time lapse microscopy also showed that mitotic progression from metaphase to telophase was ∼15–20 min faster in cells depleted of RABP1 than in control cells (Fig. 5C). Together with our demonstration that RASSF1A failed to localize to spindle poles or to bind to Cdc20 in RABP1-depleted cells (Fig. 4), these observations suggest that depletion of RABP1 accelerates mitotic progression as a result of premature APC activation. Acceleration of mitosis by premature APC activation increases the frequency of mitotic abnormalities (24Margottin-Goguet F. Hsu J.Y. Loktev A. Hsieh H.M. Reimann J.D. Jackson P.K. Dev.

Sorger P.K. Murty V.V. Benezra R. Nature. 2001; 409: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether depletion of RABP1 also induces mitotic abnormalities in HeLa cells. Immunostaining of cells with antibodies to γ-tubulin to label the centrosome and staining of DNA with DAPI revealed the presence of various mitotic spindle abnormalities, including the formation of multipolar spindles and misalignment of chromosomes on the metaphase plate, in cells depleted of RABP1 (Fig. 6). Quantitative analysis showed that the frequency of abnormal mitosis was increased about 4-fold to ∼20% in RABP1-depleted cells compared with the corresponding value for control cells. Together these results suggest that RABP1 contributes to regulation both of the timing of normal mitotic progression and of equal chromosomal segregation by recruiting RASSF1A to spindle poles, allowing RASSF1A to inhibit APC-Cdc20 activity during mitosis. The findings that RASSF1 is frequently silenced in a variety of solid tumors and that restoration of RASSF1A expression in such tumor cells inhibits cell growth both in vitro and in vivo suggest that RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor protein. We have previously shown that RASSF1A localizes to spindle poles and spindle microtubules during mitosis and that RASSF1A overexpression results in mitotic arrest before the metaphase-anaphase transition (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). RASSF1A associates with Cdc20 at the spindle apparatus and inhibits the ability of APC-Cdc20 to promote both the degradation of cyclins A and B and mitotic progression. Our previous data suggested that the inhibition of APC-Cdc20 activity by RASSF1A is mediated by a mechanism more complex than simple association of RASSF1A with Cdc20 (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 26Song M.S. Lim D.S. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 574-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now isolated a MAP-related protein, RABP1 (previously known as C19ORF5), that interacts with RASSF1A in vivo. While this manuscript was in preparation, Dallol et al. (33Dallol A. Agathanggelou A. Fenton S.L. Ahmed-Choudhury J. Hesson L. Vos M.D. Clark G.J. Downward J. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4112-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) also showed that RASSF1A interacts with MAP1A and with C19ORF5, although the functional significance of the interaction between RASSF1A and C19ORF5 was not demonstrated. Our data now show that RABP1 is a centrosomal protein and is required for RASSF1A function in mitosis. We thus found that RABP1 associates with RASSF1A through its MAP domains and colocalizes with RASSF1A at the centrosome. Overexpression of RABP1 induced mitotic arrest at prometaphase in a manner dependent on RASSF1A function. Conversely depletion of RABP1 by RNAi prevented the localization of RASSF1A to the spindle apparatus as well as induced the dissociation of RASSF1A from Cdc20, consistent with the notion that RABP1 is required for the recruitment of RASSF1A to spindle poles. Finally we showed that depletion of RABP1 resulted in acceleration of mitotic progression, premature destruction of mitotic cyclins, and an increase in the frequency of mitotic abnormalities, suggesting that RABP1 depletion induces premature activation of APC-Cdc20. Given that all of these effects of RABP1 depletion are similar to those previously observed in cells depleted of RASSF1A (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), they are likely due to loss of RASSF1A-mediated regulation of APC-Cdc20. Although we observed that overexpression of RASSF1A both delayed mitotic progression and induced mitotic abnormalities in RABP1-depleted cells (data not shown), this finding is likely attributable to the fact that RASSF1A stabilizes microtubules and binds to MAP1A as well as to RABP1 (13Liu L. Tommasi S. Lee D.H. Dammann R. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8125-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Vos M.D. Martinez A. Elam C. Dallol A. Taylor B.J. Latif F. Clark G.J.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4112-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Indeed we observed such a stabilizing effect of RASSF1A or MAP1A, whereas neither overexpression nor depletion of RABP1 affected microtubule stability in nocodazole-treated cells (Ref. 33Dallol A. Agathanggelou A. Fenton S.L. Ahmed-Choudhury J. Hesson L. Vos M.D. Clark G.J. Downward J. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4112-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar and data not shown). The stabilization of microtubule dynamics by RASSF1A thus appears to be independent of RABP1-mediated RASSF1A function. We therefore postulate that RABP1 is responsible for recruiting RASSF1A to spindle poles where RASSF1A functions to inhibit APC-Cdc20 activity rather than in regulation of microtubule stability. Mitotic progression is tightly regulated by the timed destruction of mitotic regulators, which is dependent on APC activity. The activity of the APC is itself temporally controlled by negative regulators, including Emi1, RASSF1A, and Mad2, that associate differentially with Cdc20 during mitotic progression (19Fang G. Yu H.

Emi1 inhibits the APC during G1 and prophase (24Margottin-Goguet F. Hsu J.Y. Loktev A. Hsieh H.M. Reimann J.D. Jackson P.K. Dev.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). After most Emi1 molecules are degraded during prophase, RASSF1A is responsible for inhibiting APC activity and preventing degradation of cyclins A and B until the spindle checkpoint becomes fully operational and inhibits the APC in a Mad2- and BubR1-dependent manner. In addition to its temporal regulation, the activity of APC-Cdc20 appears to be regulated in a spatially dependent manner as indicated by the observations that cyclin B disappears first from the spindle poles in human cells (35Clute P. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and Drosophila embryos (36Su T.T. Sprenger F. DiGregorio P.J. Campbell S.D. O'Farrell P.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1495-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and that activation of the APC is detected first at spindle poles (37Kraft C. Herzog F. Gieffers C. Mechtler K. Hagting A. Pines J. Peters J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6598-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The APC is thus likely activated initially at spindle poles, and the activated APC then moves into the spindle and mediates degradation of cyclin B, which is restricted to the spindle and spindle poles. The current model of spindle checkpoint activation by unattached kinetochores of chromosomes or unbalanced tension between sister chromatids might not be sufficient to explain how activated APC both mediates cyclin A degradation and initiates cyclin B degradation from spindle poles rather than from kinetochores (26Song M.S. Lim D.S. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 574-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mathe E. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 117-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although Mad2-BubR1 contributes to prevention of premature onset of anaphase, cyclin A destruction occurs before activation of the spindle checkpoint. On the basis of the results of our previous (25Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and present studies, we propose that RASSF1A is localized predominantly to spindle poles as a result of its association with RABP1 at the prophase-prometaphase transition and thereby inhibits APC-Cdc20 activity and prevents the destruction of mitotic cyclins at the spindle poles until the spindle checkpoint monitors unattached kinetochores (Fig. 7) (26Song M.S. Lim D.S. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 574-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mathe E. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 117-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Jackson P.K.

We still do not know how depletion of either RABP1 or RASSF1A induces multiple spindle poles as well as chromosome misalignment in cells. The most likely explanation is that premature activation of APC-Cdc20 due to loss of either RABP1 or RASSF1A disrupts the proper timing of mitotic regulation. Alteration of APC regulators, including Emi1, Mad2, Bub1, and BubR1, induces similar mitotic abnormalities (24Margottin-Goguet F. Hsu J.Y. Loktev A. Hsieh H.M. Reimann J.D. Jackson P.K. Dev.

Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), the molecular basis of which also remains to be determined. Given that RASSF1A also blocks cell cycle progression at the G1-S transition (11Shivakumar L. Minna J. Sakamaki T. Pestell R. White M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 12Fenton S.L. Dallol A. Agathanggelou A. Hesson L. Ahmed-Choudhury J. Baksh S. Sardet C. Dammann R. Minna J.D. Downward J. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that manipulation of RABP1 or RASSF1A results in an abnormal number of centrosomes by affecting centrosome duplication at this transition. It also remains to be determined when and how RASSF1A-mediated inhibition of APC-Cdc20 activity is relieved. In addition, given that RABP1 possesses two potential phosphorylation sites for Cdc2, it will be important to determine whether phosphorylation of RABP1 by Cdc2 affects mitotic progression. Furthermore, given that loss of RABP1, like that of RASSF1A, induced both acceleration of mitotic progression and chromosomal instability in HeLa cells, it is possible that RABP1 also functions as a tumor suppressor protein.

In conjunction with the increased availability of techniques for manipulating the genome, this has led to a proliferation of mouse models of human pathology. However, many mouse models do not express the desired phenotype associated with the gene or protein in human sufferers. For example, disruption of the gene for dystrophin results in severe muscle wasting culminating in death within the 2nd decade in humans (3Hoffman E.P. Brown Jr., R.H. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 919-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3534) Google Scholar, 4Emery A.E.H. Neuromuscul.

Potter A.C. Phelps S.R. Fisher R. Trickett J.L. Davies K.E. Nature. 1996; 384: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus, tools are needed for assessing the phenotype of a model so that gene expression and protein activity can be understood in their biological context. A similar phenomenon has also been described in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) where genetic manipulations may produce “silent phenotypes” in terms of the growth rate of yeast strains, the main characteristic for phenotyping this organism. To measure a phenotype in such “silent” strains, Raamsdonk and co-workers (6Oliver S.G. Winson M.K. Kell D.B. Baganz F. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 373-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 7Raamsdonk L.M. Teusink B. Broadhurst D. Zhang N. Hayes A. Walsh M.C. Berden J.A. Brindle K.M. Kell D.B. Rowland J.J. Westerhoff H.V. van Dam K. Oliver S.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) suggested an approach described as Functional ANalysis by Co-responses in Yeast (FANCY), which uses global analytical tools such as 1H NMR spectroscopy (7Raamsdonk L.M. Teusink B. Broadhurst D. Zhang N. Hayes A. Walsh M.C. Berden J.A. Brindle K.M. Kell D.B. Rowland J.J. Westerhoff H.V. van Dam K. Oliver S.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) or mass spectrometry (8Castrillo J.I. Hayes A. Mohammed S. Gaskell S.J. Oliver S.G. Phytochemistry. 2003; 62: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) to study the metabolic changes induced in different yeast mutants. These profiles were then used to classify samples, clustering mutants that arise from similar deletions together. For example, yeast mutants involving the deletion of one of two genes encoding the same enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, produced the same metabolic phenotype, and deletions involving oxidative phosphorylation also clustered together (7Raamsdonk L.M. Teusink B. Broadhurst D. Zhang N. Hayes A. Walsh M.C. Berden J.A. Brindle K.M. Kell D.B. Rowland J.J. Westerhoff H.V. van Dam K. Oliver S.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Thus, such a process of defining a phenotype through the global changes induced in metabolism may be used to predict the function of genes deleted or up-regulated in a given system through comparative metabolomics. The definition of a metabolic phenotype, or metabotype, by large scale analysis of metabolites using either 1H NMR spectroscopy or mass spectrometry has found a number of applications in genetic engineering, toxicology, and disease diagnosis in plants, animals, and microbes (9Fiehn O.

In this study we demonstrate that the FANCY approach described for yeast can be extended to mammalian systems by using high resolution NMR spectroscopy to classify mouse models of cardiac disease. By using multivariate analysis, the metabolic profiles of a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (mdx) (13Bullfield G. Siller W.G. Wight P.A.L. Moore K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Table I summarizes the reported phenotypical characteristics of these mouse models in terms of visual observations and gross pathology. In each model the primary genetic lesion is not associated with an enzyme or metabolic pathway, indicating that such approaches of deriving metabolic phenotypes can be applied generally to functional genomic studies. We have termed this approach “phenotype information by metabolic profiles.” Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strain background can have a profound impact on the resultant metabolism of the mouse, which may provide insights into how a given gene deletion results in very different responses across genetically diverse populations.Table IPhenotype characteristics of mouse models previously reportedDisease modelCharacterized phenotypeRef.DMDMild, nonprogressive muscle destruction with subsequent regeneration.

Male 4–5-month-old mice were removed from stable colonies of C57BL/10 control mice (n = 15), mdx mice (n = 16), MLPKO mice (n = 6), B6129S2Svs control mice to MLPKO (n = 6), Scn–/+ (n = 8), ScnΔ/+ (n = 8), and 129Sv control mice (n = 16). Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and cardiac tissue was removed rapidly. Tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C prior to NMR analysis. Genetic integrity of the colonies was monitored throughout by standard genotyping techniques. NMR Spectroscopy—Frozen cardiac tissue was pulverized using a pestle and mortar, and metabolites were extracted using perchloric acid (100 mg wet weight tissue in 1 ml of 6% perchloric acid). To further aid extraction, the perchloric acid/tissue powder mixture was further mixed using a Polytron (3 bursts for 30 s). The solution was neutralized with KOH and the precipitate discarded. The resultant solution was lyophilized, and the extracts were redissolved in D2O containing 1 mm TSP. 1The abbreviations used are: TSP, sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-[2,2,3,3-2H4]-1-propionate; MRS, magnetic resonance spectroscopy; DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy; MLPKO, muscle LIM protein knock out; HRMAS, high resolution magic angle spinning; PC, principal components; PCA, PC analysis; PLS-DA, partial least squares discriminant analysis. All solution state spectra were acquired using a 9.6-tesla superconducting magnet interfaced to an INOVA spectrometer (Varian, CA). Solvent suppressed spectra were acquired into 16,384 data points, summed over 128 scans, using continuous wave solvent suppression pulse sequence (relaxation delay = 2 s). To derive spectra from intact cardiac tissue, 10 mg of tissue was soaked in D2O and packed into zirconium oxide rotors, with 5 μl of D2O and 10 mm TSP, using a rotor spacer to ensure packing homogeneity. The rotors were spun at 6000 Hz at 300 K in a high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) probe placed in a 16.5-tesla superconducting magnet interfaced with an AVANCE spectrometer (Bruker Gmbh, Rheinstetten, Germany). HRMAS spectra were acquired using a solvent suppression sequence based on the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy pulse sequence. Free induction decays were collected into 16,384 data points and summed over 256 scans. All spectra were processed using XWINNMR software (version 3.1; Bruker Gmbh, Germany). Spectra were Fourier transformed from the time to frequency domain following multiplication by either a 0.3- or 1-Hz exponential function for solution and HRMAS spectra, respectively. Spectra were phased, base-line corrected, and referenced to the singlet of TSP at δ 0.0. Pattern Recognition of Tissue Spectra—Spectra were integrated across 0.04 ppm integral regions between 0.4 and either 4.2 or 9.4 ppm for HRMAS and solution state NMR, respectively, using a software routine written for Matlab (Mathworks). The output vector representing each spectrum was normalized across the integral regions, excluding the water resonance, effectively standardizing all the individual integrals to the total integral of all the low molecular weight metabolites (16Anthony M.L. Sweatman B.C. Beddell C.R. Lindon J.C. Nicholson J.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 199-211PubMed Google Scholar, 17Holmes E. Nicholls A.W. Lindon J.C. Ramos S. Spraul M. Neidig P. Connor S.C. Connelly J. Damment S.J. Haselden J. Nicholson J.K. NMR Biomed. 1998; 11: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Data sets were imported into the SIMCA package (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) and then preprocessed using Pareto scaling by multiplying each variable by (1/sk)1/2 where sk is the variance of the variable. This scaling effectively increases the importance of low concentration metabolites in the resultant models but not to an extent where the noise significantly contributes to the model. Data were analyzed by using principal components analysis (PCA) and the supervised regression extension, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), within the package SIMCA (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). PCA is a quantitatively rigorous method for replacing a group of variables with a smaller number of new variables, called principal components (PC), which are linear combinations of the original variables. All the principal components are orthogonal to each other so there is no redundant information. Projecting the observations on one of these axes generates another new variable designed to maximize the description of the variance in the data set. PLS-DA is a generalization of PCA where a projection model is developed predicting class membership from the variables (X matrix) via scores of these variables through a generalized multiple regression method that can cope with a number of variables being correlated with class membership. Cross-validation of PLS-DA was carried out by leaving out every 6th observation and predicting the observation's class membership on a new model as part of a jack-knifing routine. The prediction error sum of squares (PRESS) is the squared differences between observed and predicted values for the data. For every component, the overall PRESS/SS was calculated, where SS is the residual sum of squares of the previous dimension. The final PRESS score then has contributions from all data. The goodness of fit algorithm was used to determine whether a correlation was significant (Q2 > 0.05), and is defined in Equation 1.Qcum2=1−∑(PRESS/SS)(Eq. 1) The major metabolic perturbations between cardiac tissues from different mouse models were determined from loadings scores and the variable importance parameters for each pattern recognition model. Loading plots display the correlation between the X variables, in the first dimension, or the residuals of the X variables in subsequent dimensions, and class membership. X variables with large weights (positive or negative) are highly correlated with class. Variable importance parameter is the influence on class membership (Y) of every term in the model, summed over all model dimensions, and is equal to the squared PLS weight of that term, multiplied by the explained SS of that PLS dimension (18Eriksson L. Johansson E. Kettaneh-Wold N. Wold S. Introduction to Multi- and Megavariate Data Analysis Using Projection Methods (PCA and PLS). Umetrics, Umea, Sweden1999Google Scholar). To confirm the importance of these metabolites, the integral regions were excluded from the analysis to examine their leverage on the models produced. New models were produced in an analogous manner to the jackknifing routine described previously, and the goodness of fit algorithm was used to determine whether a metabolite was responsible for a statistically significant classification. Overt Signs of Disease Detected Visually—Overall, overt pathological signs were minor for the four disease models for the age range examined, with all mice showing similar levels of activity, and no increase in mortality rate was detected for any of the mouse mutants at this age. Consistent with previous literature reports there was no significant difference in cardiac mass for the mdx and sodium channel modification mouse models (data not shown). However, as previously reported, the MLPKO mouse heart demonstrated mild hypertrophy at this age (mass of MLPKO hearts, 0.255 ± 0.051 g; B6129S2Svs control strain, 0.185 ± 0.023 g; unpaired t test p = 0.0119). No pathological changes were detected post-mortem by visual inspection of the hearts from mdx, Scn–/+, and ScnΔ/+ during dissection, but the MLPKO mice had signs of both ventricular and atrial hypertrophy producing a pointed shaping to the heart. Deriving Metabolic Profiles Using NMR Spectroscopy—High resolution 1H NMR spectra of aqueous cardiac tissue extracts allowed the quantification of the concentrations of lactate, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, citrate, succinate, creatine, choline, phosphocholine, taurine, glucose, and adenosine in the tissues (Fig. 1A). As lipid metabolites also significantly influence the metabolism of the heart, HRMAS 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 1B) were acquired on tissue from the bottom of the left ventricle from 4-month-old Scn–/+ (n = 5), ScnΔ/+ (n = 8), MLPKO (n = 8), and mdx (n = 6) mice as well as the control wild type strains C57BL/10 (n = 3), 129Sv (n = 8), and B6129S2Svs control strain (n = 8). As well as resonances from lipids and glycogen, a number of water-soluble metabolites could be detected including lactate, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, glutamate, creatine, choline, phosphocholine, taurine, and glucose. Visual inspection of the NMR spectra failed to distinguish either disease status or strain type for the animal models of cardiac diseases investigated for either data set. Cardiac Tissue from Different Mouse Strains Could Be Distinguished by the Concentration of Water-soluble Metabolites—By applying PCA to the analysis of the solution state spectra, clusterings were detected arising from strain differences between the different mouse models (Fig. 2A). This strain difference was represented by the first two PCs and accounted for 44% of the total variation in the data set. The metabolites contributing to these clusterings were identified from the loadings scores, representing the weighting of the contribution each metabolite made to a particular PC (Fig. 2B). The 129Sv strain background mice all had increased concentrations of creatine (chemical shift of resonances identified in the loadings scores (δ): 3.04 and 3.92), lactate (δ 1.34), phosphocholine (δ 3.24), and choline (δ 3.20) compared with the other strains, whereas the C57BL/10 strain background was characterized by increased concentrations of glucose (δ 3.48, 3.52, and 3.56) and β-hydroxybutyrate (δ 1.12 and 1.16). Aqueous extracts of cardiac tissue from the B6129S2Svs strain background exhibited a higher concentration of taurine (δ 3.28 and 3.44). To examine whether these differences in relative metabolite concentrations in tissue extracts could be used to predict the mouse strain from which the tissue was derived, a supervised PLS-DA model was built with the data set (Fig. 2C), and class membership was predicted for each strain. This model correctly predicted the strain for both mice on C57BL/10 and 129Sv backgrounds with 100% accuracy, but only produced a model that was 53% accurate for the B6129S2Svs background strain. To define further the difference between strains measured in this data set, a Cooman's plot was formed using PCA models of the C57BL/10 and the 129Sv backgrounds (Fig. 2D). For this a PCA model was built to describe the variation in just the subset of data relating to a particular strain. These two models were then used to predict whether each observation belonged to the C57BL/10 background, the 129Sv background, could not be separated (i.e. the model predicted the sample to be both C57BL/10 and 129Sv), or belonged to neither model. Only one observation from the 129Sv background subset was outside the 95% confidence limit for this strain, whereas all the C57BL/10 background mice were within the 95% confidence limit for this strain (i.e. the strain of only one mouse was not correctly predicted for the 129Sv and C57BL/10 mice). By using this Cooman's plot, two spectra from the B6129S2Svs background were misclassified, and the rest of the data set were determined to lie outside the two PCA models (i.e. were correctly predicted as being neither 129Sv nor C57BL/10 strain mice). To examine whether the different strain backgrounds also had different proportions of NMR-detectable lipids, a similar analysis was performed on the HRMAS 1H NMR spectra data set. Again, strain differences dominated the PCA of the complete HRMAS data set. This separation was further improved by building a PLS-DA model with this model predicting class membership for all 48 spectra in terms of the strain (Fig. 2E). The 10 most important resonance regions responsible for this classification as identified by the variable importance parameter were from the metabolites taurine (δ 3.28 and 3.44), CH2CH2CH2 lipids (boldface type indicates the resonance observed; δ 1.24–1.36), lactate (δ 1.32), choline (δ 3.2), CH3CH2 lipid (δ 0.92), phosphocholine (δ 3.24), and creatine (δ 3.04) (Fig. 2F). Despite Strain Differences, Distinct Metabolic Profiles Are Still Detectable for Each Mouse Model—As strain differences dominated the first components of the PCA model, and PLS-DA models were used to distinguish the four animal models of disease. We used three different routines to identify metabolic changes with the disease process (Fig. 3). For the first set of models the data were correlated to distinguish one disease model (one group) from the total remaining data set (the other group representing all other disease models and all control mice). The most significant model in terms of the goodness of fit algorithm (Q2) was produced for Scn–/+ mice (Q2cum = 0.46), then ScnΔ/+ mice (Q2cum = 0.38), then MLPKO mice (Q2cum = 0.25), and the least for the model of DMD (Q2cum = 0.17) (models not shown). These models were used to predict disease status across the complete group (Table II).Table IIComparing one disease group against all miceMouse modelsNMR experimentComponentsR2cumQ2cumCorrect predictions for mouse modelCorrect predictions for other modelsScnΔ/+Solution20.380.395/864/64HRMAS20.310.144/840/40Scn-/+Solution40.510.467/865/65HRMAS20.310.296/737/41MLPKOSolution20.360.254/863/64HRMAS20.380.298/840/40MdxSolution10.180.178/1458/58HRMAS10.330.073/642/42 Open table in a new tab However, because of the large differences associated with strain, the data from the individual disease models and their respective control strain were processed alone using PLS-DA. Highly predictive models were produced for each disease Fig. 4, A–C. Each disease state had a distinctive metabolic profile and could be distinguished by the variable importance parameter scores of key metabolites (Fig. 4, D–"

We identified a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-interacting protein-like box sequence in APC that binds DNA polymerase β and blocks DNA polymerase β-mediated strand-displacement synthesis in long patch BER without affecting short patch BER. We further showed that the colon cancer cell line expressing the wild-type APC gene was more sensitive to a DNA-methylating agent due to decreased DNA repair by long patch BER than the cell line expressing the mutant APC gene lacking the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-interacting protein-like box. Experiments based on RNA interference showed that the wild-type APC gene expression is required for DNA methylation-induced sensitivity of colon cancer cells.

Organisms continually repair damaged DNA. Knowledge of these repair responses is critical to our understanding of how and why the genome is affected during the lifespan of the organism. DNA repair systems efficiently remove damaged DNA via several different pathways that reverse the vast majority of genetic lesions formed during the lifespan of a cell (reviewed in Ref. 1Wood R.D.

It is mediated through two pathways that are differentiated by the size of the repair gap and the enzymes involved (2Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P.

Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These pathways are designated “single nucleotide BER,” also referred to as “short patch (SP) BER,” and “multinucleotide (2–13-nucleotide repair patch) BER,” also referred to as “long patch (LP) BER.” In both pathways, repair is initiated by the removal of a damaged base by a DNA glycosylase, leaving an abasic or apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. Several enzymes, acting in an orderly fashion, participate in DNA synthesis and the filling of the gaps, including N-glycosylase, AP endonuclease (APE), pol-β (also has deoxyribose phosphatase activity), or polymerase δ/ϵ, flap endonuclease 1 (Fen-1), and DNA ligase I (reviewed in Ref. 4Christmann M. Tomicic M.T. Roos W.P. Kaina B. Toxicology. 2003; 193: 3-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). PCNA does not participate directly but is an important cofactor in several of these activities and has been shown to bind APE, Fen-1, and DNA ligase I through the PCNA-interacting protein-like box (PIP-like box) motifs in these proteins and to modulate their activity (reviewed in Refs. 5Matsumoto Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 129-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 6Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The physiologic basis for the selection of one BER pathway over the other has not been established. It has been suggested that the utilization of the SP- and LP-BER pathways is determined by the type of damage encountered on DNA (reviewed in Ref. 7Dogliotti E. Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 3-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this scenario, simple basic sites would generally be repaired through the SP-BER pathway; upon oxidation or reduction of the sites, they would be repaired through the LP-BER pathway. Recently, it has been reported that a decrease in the ATP concentration shifts utilization of the SP-BER pathway to the LP-BER pathway through the stimulation of strand displacement synthesis by pol-β (8Petermann E. Ziegler M. Oei S.L. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have observed an increase in APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene expression upon exposure of colon cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents (9Narayan S. Jaiswal A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30619-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Jaiswal A.S. Narayan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18193-18199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of an interaction between APC and the DNA repair machinery. Here, we provide evidence that APC plays a role in regulating DNA repair by interacting directly with pol-β and blocking its ability to mediate LP-BER strand displacement synthesis. The blocked LP-BER then increases sensitivity of colon cancer cells to DNA-methylating agent, which in turn causes DNA damage that is repaired by LP-BER. Preparation of Nuclear Extract—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Shapiro et al. (11Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) from HCT-116, LoVo, and LS411N colon cancer cell lines as well as from the isogenic mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that contain either the wild-type (MEF-polβ) or a cell line in which the DNA polymerase gene β (pol-β) has been knocked out (MEF-polβKO). APC Peptides—A peptide, 20 amino acids in length (KVSSINQETIQTYCVEDTPI), representing the PIP-like box of the wild-type APC, APCwt-(1250–1269), or a mutated form of the APC, APCmut-(1250–1269), in which amino acids 1256, 1259, and 1262 were replaced with alanine (KVSSINAETAQTACVEDTPI) was synthesized at the Protein Chemistry and Biomarkers core facility of the ICBR of the University of Florida. Pull-down Assays—For pull-down assays, 150–200 μg of nuclear extracts were precleared by incubating them with 2 μg of rabbit IgG at 4 °C for 2 h. The mixture was rocked for 2 h, a slurry of bovine serum albumin-blocked protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the precleared supernatant was incubated with anti-APC rabbit polyclonal antibody (Bio-Synthesis Inc., Lewisville, TX) at 4 °C for 4 h. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were then added, and the mixture was incubated for a further 3–4 h at 4 °C and then washed five times with a washing buffer (pH 7.9) containing 20 mm Hepes buffer, 100 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 to remove unbound proteins. Western Blot Analysis—To determine the interaction of APC with PCNA and pol-β, Western blot analysis of the immunocomplexes was carried out as described previously (9Narayan S. Jaiswal A.S. J. Biol.

Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar); anti-PCNA (mouse monoclonal) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-APC (Ab-1) from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA), and anti-α-tubulin from Sigma. Far Western Blot Analysis—APCwt-(1250–1269) and APCmut-(1250–1269) peptides and PCNA and glutathione S-transferase-p21 proteins were slot-blotted (0–10 μg) onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in a binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 60 mm KCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40. After blotting, the membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline with 0.025% (v/v) Tween 20 prior to incubation with purified PCNA or pol-β proteins. Binding was detected using anti-PCNA or anti-pol-β antibodies as the primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. The signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The yeast two-hybrid system was used to determine the functional interaction of APC with pol-β in vivo. The APC cDNA fragments containing the wild type (amino acids 1190–1328) or mutant (amino acids 1200–1324) PIP-like box binding motifs for protein-protein interaction studies were fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) in plasmid pGBDU-C3. The interacting proteins such as full-length pol-β and PCNA were fused with the yeast GAL4 activation domain (AD) in plasmid pGAD-C3 (13James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adapters were included as needed for in-frame insertion of APC, pol-β, and PCNA sequences relative to GAL4 BD or GAL4 AD plasmids. The yeast strain S. cerevisiae PJ69–4A was co-transformed with pGBDU-C3- and pGAD-C3-derived plasmids (13James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transformation, cells were spread on plates containing yeast synthetic dropout (SD)-UL medium lacking only vector markers Ura for pGBDU-C3-derived plasmids and Leu for pGAD-C3-derived plasmids. To test potential protein-protein interactions, transformed cells were screened for growth on yeast SD-ULH medium (SD medium lacking Ura, Leu, and His), but containing 5 mm His3 inhibitor, 3-amino-1,2,4-trizole, to prevent His3 reporter gene auto-activation. Protein interactions were further confirmed by a β-galactosidase filter lift assay. Synthesis and Labeling of DNA Substrates—The nucleotide sequence of the 63-mer oligonucleotide for SP-BER has a U residue at position 24 and is referred as U-DNA (5′-TAGATGCCTGCAGCTGATGCGCUGTACGGATCCACGTGTACGGTACCGAGGGCGGGTCGACA-3′). To examine LP-BER activity, the 63-mer AP site analog (3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran) was synthesized as described earlier and is referred to as F-DNA (14Jaiswal A.S. Bloom L.B. Narayan S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5912-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of F-DNA is the same as for U-DNA, except that the U has been replaced with F. After synthesis, these DNA substrates were gel-purified, labeled with [γ-32P]ATP at the 5′-end using T-4 polynucleotide kinase, and annealed with a complementary oligonucleotide with a G residue opposite to the AP site. In Vitro BER Assay—The BER reaction was reconstituted using purified proteins under the following conditions. The reaction mixture for LP BER contained 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm ATP, and 10 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP in a final volume of 20 μl. The BER reaction mixture was assembled on ice by the addition of 0.5 nm APE, 10 nm PCNA, 2.5 nm pol-β, 10 nm Fen-1, and 100 nm DNA ligase I and incubated for 5 min. The concentrations of the APCwt-(1250–1269) and APCmut-(1250–1269) peptides used in each experiment are given in the figure legends. For SP-BER, the reaction mixture was the same except that 1 unit of uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) was added at the beginning of the incubation. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 2.5 ng of 32P-labeled F- or U-DNA substrates for LP- and SP-BER, respectively. The reaction mixture was then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.4% (w/v) SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg of proteinase K and 10 μg of carrier RNA. After incubation for an additional 30 min at 37 °C, the DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. APC Gene Silencing Assays—For APC gene silencing, the small interfering RNA sense and antisense oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCGCAACAGAAGCAGAGAGGTTTCAAGAGAACCTCTCTGCTTCTGTTGCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGCAACAGAAGCAGAGAGGTTCTCTTGAAACCTCTCTGCTTCTGTTGCG-3′, respectively, were annealed and subcloned into pSilencer 2.1 vector system (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) to generate pSiRNA-APC plasmid (15Verma U.N. Surabhi R.M. Schmaltieg A. Becerra C. Gaynor R.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1291-1300PubMed Google Scholar). A 19-nucleotide sequence of the pSiRNA-APC plasmid was scrambled to generate pSiRNA-APCmut plasmid. The sense and antisense nucleotide sequences for the pSiRNA-APCmut plasmid were 5′-GATCCGGACAGTAAGGAAGAACGCTTCAAGAGAGCGTTCTTCCTTACTGTCCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGGACAGTAAGGAAGAACGCTCTCTTGAAGCGTTCTTCCTTACTGTCCG-3′, respectively. Specificity of the mutant 19-nt sequence was confirmed by a BLAST search against the human genome sequence. The isogenic HCT-116, HCT-116+Ch3, and HCT-116+Ch2 human colon cancer cell lines were grown in 96-well tissue culture plates in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% (v/v) of fetal bovine serum, except 400 μg/ml of G418 sulfate was added in the medium of HCT-116+Ch3 and HCT-116+Ch2 cell lines. Cells were transfected with the above plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 16 h of transfection, the cells were starved for 16 h and then treated with different concentrations of DNA-methylating agent, methylmethane sulfonate (MMS; Aldrich). After 1 h of treatment, the MMS-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The survival of the cells was measured after 24 h by MTT assay (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Parallel experiments were performed for preparing cell lysates to measure the APC protein levels in treated and untreated cells (9Narayan S. Jaiswal A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30619-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Comet Assay—For evaluating DNA damage and repair, a single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) kit was used (Trivigen, Gaithersburg, MD). The HCT-116 cells were transfected with pSiRNA-APC or pSiRNA-APCmut plasmids and treated with MMS for 1 h. After treatment, the medium was replaced with a fresh medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and incubated for an additional 24 h. Plasmid transfection and MMS treatment conditions to the cells were the same as described above. The single-cell gel electrophoresis of DNA was performed as described by the manufacturer. DNA from cells was visualized using SYBRgreen dye. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan-2 Imaging, Thornwood, NY) at ×20 magnification. APC Has PCNA- and Pol-β-binding Motifs—After observing an increase in APC gene expression in response to DNA-damaging agents (9Narayan S. Jaiswal A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30619-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Jaiswal A.S. Narayan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18193-18199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we used a bioinformatics approach to explore the possibility that APC expresses binding sites for known components of the two pathways of BER. The presence of a PIP-like box in APC would be of particular interest, since this well conserved motif mediates interactions of PCNA with other DNA repair/replication proteins (reviewed in Refs. 5Matsumoto Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 129-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 6Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) including p21(Waf-1/Cip1), xeroderma pigmentosum group G, DNA-(cytosine-5)-methyltransferase, replication factor C-p140, polymerase δ third subunit, MSH6, uracil-DNA-glycosylase 2, and a mammalian ortholog of the Escherichia coli MutY DNA glycosylase (MYH) as well as APE, pol-β, Fen-1, and DNA ligase I (16Kedar P.S. Kim S.J. Robertson A. Hou E. Prasad R. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31115-31123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs. 5Matsumoto Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 129-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 6Warbrick E. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The PIP-like box consists of a sequence QXX(h)XX(a)(a), in which “h” represents amino acid residues with moderately hydrophobic side chains (e.g. Leu, Ile, or Met), “a” represents residues with highly hydrophobic side chains (e.g. Phe and Tyr), and “X” is any residue (reviewed in Ref. 5Matsumoto Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 129-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A matrix for the PIP-like box was built using the meta-MEME program developed by Bailey and Elkman (17Bailey C. Elkman C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar), which was used for a search of the motif using the program as described by Zhou et al. (18Zhou L. Song Z. Tittel J. Steller H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The meta-MEME program identified a conserved PIP-like box between residues 1245 and 1273 of APC (Fig. 1A). In extending these studies to explore the possibility of whether DNA repair proteins interact with APC, an interaction with pol-β was discovered. Pull-down assays showed that wild-type APC physically associates with pol-β in nuclear extracts of HCT-116 cells as well as mouse embryonic fibroblast cells that express wild-type pol-β (12Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–3 and 10–12, respectively) but not in nuclear extracts of LoVo and LS411N cells, which lack the PIP-like box in APC (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–6 and 7–9, respectively), or MEF-polβKO cells (12Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), which lack pol-β (Fig. 1C, lanes 13–15). This interaction was further confirmed by far Western analysis, in which the wild-type APC peptide containing the PIP-like box, APCwt-(1250–1269), was found to bind to pol-β in a dose-dependent manner, whereas mutant peptide, APCmut-(1250–1269), in which the critical residues in the PIP-like box motif were replaced with alanine (Fig. 1B), did not (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The further pull-down experiments showed an interaction of APC with PCNA but no interaction with other BER proteins such as APE and DNA ligase I (data not shown). The above in vitro interactions of APC and pol-β were further confirmed by yeast two-hybrid analysis. A positive interaction was observed between APCwt and pol-β but not with APCmut-expressing plasmids (Fig. 2B). The plasmid that contained only pol-β-binding domain (pol-β-BD) served as a negative control for background colonies. To verify our assay system, we used PCNA- and pol-β-expressing plasmids (Fig. 2B), whose interaction has been shown in earlier studies (16Kedar P.S. Kim S.J. Robertson A. Hou E. Prasad R. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31115-31123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These results support that APC interacts with pol-β both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The finding that the PCNA and pol-β can interact with APC at the same PIP-like box region was surprising. Peptides with PCNA-binding motifs such as p21 bind to specific sites on the interdomain connector loops of PCNA (19Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 20Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). If pol-β has a binding site on its surface that is like those on PCNA that would accommodate binding by a PCNA-binding motif, then other proteins such as p21 with a PIP box should compete APC for binding to pol-β. To address this hypothesis, we performed a far Western analysis in which the pol-β binding to APC was allowed to compete with p21. The APC blot was first incubated with p21 and then with pol-β. After incubation, the blot was probed with anti-pol-β antibody to determine the interaction of p21 and pol-β with APC. Under the experimental conditions, it was expected that if p21 binds with APC then it will compete for the binding with pol-β. However, we observed a strong pol-β interaction signal with the APCwt-(1250–1269) peptide, which increased in a dose-dependent manner, and a faint signal with APCmut-(1250–1269) peptide (Fig. 2C, compare lane 1 with lane 2). These results suggest that p21 did not compete pol-β for the binding to APC. On the other hand, when PCNA was immobilized on the membrane and incubated with p21 first and then with pol-β, the p21 completely blocked the binding of pol-β with PCNA (Fig. 2C, lane 3), suggesting a strong binding of p21 with PCNA. From these results, it can be concluded that the interaction of pol-β with APC is unique, and PCNA and pol-β do not share a common site for interaction with the PCNA-binding motif. Thus, the PIP-like box of APC may be interacting with pol-β and PCNA in different ways. APC Blocks Pol-β-dependent LP Strand Displacement Synthesis—Pol-β functions as a critical polymerase in BER, whereas PCNA modulates the activity of pol-β (16Kedar P.S. Kim S.J. Robertson A. Hou E.

Kaina B. Toxicology. 2003; 193: 3-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), APE (21Dianova I.I. Bohr V.A. Dianov G.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12639-12644Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), Fen-1 (22Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 10: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) through interaction with the PIP-like box motifs in these molecules. Thus, the binding of PCNA and pol-β to the PIP-like box expressed on the APC molecule could have functional implications. The potential effects of the interactions were determined using an in vitro reconstitution assay, in which synthetic APC peptides were incubated for 5 min with purified APE, pol-β, and PCNA prior to the addition of dNTPs and the substrate. For analysis of LP-BER, 63-mer [32P]F-DNA is used as the substrate (14Jaiswal A.S. Bloom L.B. Narayan S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5912-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In F-DNA, the nucleotide at position 24 is replaced with 3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (F). These assays revealed that the addition of the APCwt-(1250–1269) synthetic peptide (Fig. 3, compare lane 3 with lane 4) effectively blocked pol-β-mediated strand displacement without affecting pol-β-mediated 1-nucleotide incorporation (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 6, and 9–12) or APE-mediated generation of the 23-mer incision product of [32P]F-DNA (Fig. 3, compare lane 1 with lane 2). The addition of the APCmut-(1250–1269) peptide had no effect on any of these activities (Fig. 3, compare lane 9 with lane 10). Further characterization of the effect of the APCwt-(1250–1269) peptide confirmed these results. The time course and concentration dependence of the APC-mediated block of pol-β-mediated strand displacement synthesis have been established (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively).Fig. 4Characterization of the effect of APC peptide on strand displacement synthesis.A, time course. The BER reaction mixture was assembled with APE, PCNA, and pol-β for 5 min on ice. Then 2 μm of APCwt-(1250–1269) or APCmut-(1250–1269) peptide, [32P]F-DNA, and dNTPs were added and incubated at 37 °C. At different time intervals, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed. B, concentration curve. The BER reaction mixture was assembled with APE, PCNA, pol-β, and different concentrations of APCwt-(1250–1269) or APCmut-(1250–1269) peptide for 5 min on ice.

The arrows show different BER products including a 23-mer incision product, 1-nt incorporation product, and 2–7-nt strand displacement products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although PCNA can play a role in the regulation of LP-BER (reviewed in Ref. 4Christmann M. Tomicic M.T. Roos W.P. Kaina B. Toxicology. 2003; 193: 3-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), PCNA neither stimulated pol-β-mediated strand displacement synthesis (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 5) nor interfered with the APCwt-(1250–1269)-dependent block in pol-β-mediated strand displacement synthesis (Fig. 3, compare lanes 4 and 6) in these assays. Since the APCwt-(1250–1269) peptide blocks pol-β-mediated strand displacement synthesis without affecting 1-nucleotide incorporation, the possibility arose that other mediators of strand displacement synthesis, such as Fen-1 and DNA ligase I, could readily compensate for the APC-induced block in pol-β activity. The APCwt-(1250–1269)-mediated block of strand displacement synthesis was not relieved by the addition of Fen-1 (Fig. 5, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 8 and 9, and compare lane 13 with lanes 14 and 15, respectively). Moreover, the strand displacement synthesis stimulated by Fen-1 in the absence of APC was unaffected by the addition of PCNA (Fig. 5, compare lane 3 with lane 5 and lane 4 with lane 6). The addition of DNA ligase I into reaction mixtures containing the APCwt-(1250–1269) peptide did not relieve the block in the generation of a 63-mer 32P-labeled F-DNA ligated product (Fig. 5, compare lane 10 with lanes 11 and 12). To eliminate the possibility that the length of the DNA affects the functional outcome, we also used 25-mer [32P]F-DNA as a substrate. Similar results were observed with the APCwt-(1250–1269) peptide in which pol-β-mediated strand displacement synthesis was blocked without affecting 1-nucleotide incorporation activity (Fig. 6, compare lane 5 with lane 6). The APCwt-(1250–1269) peptide-mediated blockage of the pol-β-mediated strand displacement synthesis was not relieved after the addition of DNA ligase I (Fig. 6, compare lane 10 with lane 11). The APCmut-(1250–1269) peptide, on the other hand, did not block the strand displacement synthesis and showed a 25-mer repaired product in the presence of DNA ligase I (Fig. 6, compare lane 5 with lane 8 and lane 10 with lane 12, respectively).Fig. 6The APCwt-(1250–1269) peptide blocks the LP- but not the SP-BER, as tested with 25-mer-long DNA substrates (A). B, the BER reaction mixture was assembled on ice for 5 min for short patch BER with UDG, APE, pol-β, PCNA, and Fen-1 proteins and 2 μm APCwt-(1250–1269) or APCmut-(1250–1269) peptide. For the long patch BER, the reaction mixture was the same as above, except the UDG was eliminated. The repair reaction was initiated with [32P]U-DNA or [32P]F-DNA for short and long patch, respectively, and dNTPs. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then 100 nm DNA ligase I was added in to the reaction mixture, and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min at 37 °C.View L"
https://openalex.org/W2016754173,"In a previous study, we showed that protein kinase C βII (PKC βII) translocated to a novel juxtanuclear compartment as observed in several cell types (Becker, K. P., and Hannun, Y. A. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 52747–52754). In this study, we noted the absence of this translocation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and we examined the mechanisms underlying this selectivity of response. We show that sustained stimulation of PKC βII with 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in accumulation of ceramide in MCF-7 cells but not in those cells that showed juxtanuclear translocation of PKC βII. Addition of exogenous ceramides or formation of endogenous ceramide by the action of bacterial sphingomyelinase prevented PMA-induced translocation of PKC βII in HEK 293 cells. On the other hand, inhibition of ceramide accumulation with fumonisin B1 restored the ability of PMA to induce translocation of PKC βII in MCF-7 cells. Taken together, the results showed that endogenous ceramide is both necessary and sufficient for preventing juxtanuclear translocation of PKC βII in response to PMA. Investigation of the mechanisms of ceramide generation in response to PMA revealed that PMA activated the salvage pathway of ceramide formation and not the de novo pathway. This conclusion was based on the following: 1) the ability of fumonisin B1 but not myriocin to inhibit ceramide formation, 2) the ability of PMA to induce increases in palmitate-labeled ceramide only under chase labeling but not acute pulse labeling, 3) the induction of the levels of sphingosine but not dihydrosphingosine in response to PMA, and 4) induction of sphingomyelin hydrolysis in response to PMA. Together, these results define a novel pathway of regulated formation of ceramide, the salvage pathway, and they define a role for this pathway in regulating juxtanuclear translocation of PKC βII.

This group consists of PKC α, PKC βI, PKC βII, and PKC γ that share highly homologous regulatory domains and are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium. Thus, they serve as signal transducers for the action of extracellular agonists that activate phospholipases C, which results in the generation of DAG and calcium (2Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem.

This novel translocation is seen with prolonged stimulation of these two isoenzymes of PKC by PMA (for at least 30 min) and follows the initial translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane (seen as early as 2–5 min following stimulation with PMA). Most interestingly, this novel translocation operates selectively on PKC α and βII in that it is not observed with PKC βI or any of the nonclassical PKCs (1Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52747-52754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28251-28256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, this translocation involves activation of PLD (6Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28251-28256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the interaction of PKC with PLD (5Hu T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35702-35708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This novel juxtanuclear compartment is centered around and beyond the centrosome and the microtubule-organizing center, and therefore we have described it as the “pericentrion.” In the course of studying this novel translocation of PKC, we noted that although it is seen in most cell types, we could not observe it in a few cell lines such as MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells and LnCAP prostate cancer cells. Because PKC activation in LnCAP was previously associated with formation of ceramide (7Garzotto M. White-Jones M. Jiang Y. Ehleiter D. Liao W.C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar), we wondered if ceramide could regulate this translocation of PKC. Ceramide is a neutral lipid that serves as the hub of sphingolipid synthesis, analogous to the role of DAG in glycerolipid metabolism. However, unlike DAG, which appears to be involved in the regulation of mitogenesis and tumor promotion, ceramide has been implicated in regulating cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cell senescence (8Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25847-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 9Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol.

Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2001; 64: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Indeed, the regulation of ceramide metabolism has received increasing attention over the past 15 years with increasing appreciation that many of the enzymes of ceramide metabolism are regulated and that this regulation may subserve specific cellular functions. Thus far, studies have primarily focused on two major pathways of ceramide formation (Fig. 1) as follows: the first through activation of sphingomyelinases, which hydrolyze sphingomyelin and liberate ceramide (11Levade T. Jaffrezou J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 12Marchesini N. Hannun Y.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar); and the second involves activation of the de novo pathway, which commences with the condensation of serine and palmitate through the action of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) (13Perry D.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The list of activators of these pathways continues to grow and includes cytokines, chemotherapeutic agents, cytotoxic peptides (e.g. amyloid β peptide), and other environmental stresses. Other studies are also beginning to show regulation of enzymes of ceramide clearance such as ceramidases, glucosylceramide synthase, and sphingomyelin synthase (14Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence for a specific role for endogenous ceramide in inhibiting the novel juxtanuclear translocation of PKC to the pericentrion. Most importantly, we show that sustained activation of PKC over 30–60 min activates the salvage pathway of sphingolipid metabolism (Fig. 1) by which sphingoid bases generated from hydrolysis of complex sphingolipids are recycled into ceramide synthesis. This is the first description of regulation of this pathway in response to an agonist. Thus, the results define a negative feedback mechanism in the activation of PKC involving PKC-induced formation of endogenous ceramide through the salvage pathway. Materials—Eagle's minimal essential media, RPMI, and HEPES were from Invitrogen. The MCF-7 and HEK 293 cell lines were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). [3H]Palmitic acid was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 4β-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Calbiochem. C6-ceramide was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Phospholipid standards were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Fumonisin B1 was from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Whatman Silica Gel 60 TLC plates were from Fisher. Bacterial SMase and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture—MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI, and HEK 293 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential media supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were passaged every 3–4 days to maintain cells in logarithmic growth. Plasmid Construction—All recombinant DNA procedures were carried out following standard protocols. The wild type pBK-CMV-GFP-PKC-βII was described previously (15Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—Transient transfection of DNA (1.5 μg/dish) was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfected cells were grown for 12 h 10% fetal bovine serum media. A transfection efficiency of 40–60% was obtained in these experiments. Cells expressing green fluorescent (GFP) fusion proteins alone were viewed live in 10 mm HEPES-buffered media or viewed immediately following a 10-min fixation with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, 10% methanol pre-warmed to 37 °C. All confocal images were taken with an Olympus UltraView Spinning Disk Confocal IX-70 system with an Olympus 60× 1.4 NA lens and krypton/argon laser line. Each microscopic image is representative of 20 fields over a minimum of three experiments, and all images were taken at the equatorial plane of the cell. GFP fusion proteins were excited at 488 nm. All fluorescent images were captured sequentially and combined within the UltraView software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Raw data images were cropped in Adobe Photoshop® 5.0 for publication. Palmitate Labeling—For chase experiments, MCF-7 cells were labeled (16–24 h) in 35-mm dishes with 3.0 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% delipidated bovine serum albumin. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, and serum-free RPMI, 0.1% bovine serum albumin media was added. Cells were allowed to recover in serum-free media at 37 °C for 30 min prior to stimulation. Cells were stimulated with PMA for the specified times and at the noted concentrations. All incubations were performed at 37 °C. For pulse labeling experiments, cells were placed in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h and then treated with PMA in concurrence with labeling with 3 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid for 1 h. Choline Labeling for Measuring Sphingomyelin—Chase labeling experiments using [3H]choline chloride were performed to measure changes in sphingomyelin levels. Cells were incubated with 3 μCi/ml [3H]choline for 72 h and then replaced in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After PMA treatment, lipids were extracted as above and further subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis. Lipid Extraction and Analysis—Following stimulation, the culture media were removed, and the cells were washed rapidly three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. Total cellular lipids were extracted via the method of Bligh and Dyer (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42377) Google Scholar). Lipids were dried down and resuspended in 75 μl chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Fifty μl of the 75-μl volume was loaded per lane. The TLC solvent system consisted of ethyl acetate/iso-octane/acetic acid (9:5:2, v/v/v) for resolving ceramides and chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (50:30:8:5, v/v/v/v) for resolving sphingomyelin. The plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE Spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to amplify the tritium signal and then exposed for autoradiography for 24 h. The major ceramide species were identified by running C16- and C24-ceramide standards along side each sample. Each experiment was repeated 3–5 times. The area corresponding to each lipid was scraped off, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. LC/MS—Briefly, cell pellets corresponding to about 2–3 × 106 cells were fortified with the internal standards (ISs: C17 base d-erythrosphingosine, N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-C13-sphingosine, and heptadecanoyl-d-erythrosphingosine) and extracted with an ethyl acetate/isopropyl alcohol/water (60:30:10, v/v/v) solvent system. After evaporation and reconstitution in 100 μl of methanol, samples were injected on the Surveyor/TSQ 7000 LC/MS system and gradient-eluted from the BDS Hypersil C8, 150 × 3.2 mm, 3-μm particle size column, with 1.0 mm methanolic ammonium formate, 2 mm aqueous ammonium formate mobile phase system. Peaks corresponding to the target analytes and internal standards were integrated and processed using the XCalibur software system. Quantitative analysis was based on the calibration curves generated by spiking an artificial matrix with the known amounts of the target analyte synthetic standards and an equal amount of the ISs. The target analyte/IS peak area ratios were plotted against analyte concentration. The target analyte/IS peak area ratios from the samples were similarly normalized to their respective ISs and compared with the calibration curves, using a linear regression model. Levels of sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, and ceramide species with specific fatty acid moieties, C14, dihydro-C16, C16, C18:1, C18, C20, C24:1, and C24, were determined and normalized to total phospholipid phosphate. Small Interfering RNA Transfection—A small interfering RNA duplex (siRNA) for human glucosylceramide synthase (AACAGCCTTATAGCAAGCTCC) was synthesized and purified by Qiagen (Lafayette, CO). MCF-7 cells were transfected with the siRNA or scrambled RNA as control using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Translocation of GFP-PKCβII to a Subset of Recycling Endosomes in HEK 293 but Not in MCF-7 Cells—The novel translocation of classical PKC isoenzymes, α and βII, to a subset of recycling endosomes concentrated around the microtubule-organizing center/centrosome (the pericentrion) was observed in several cell types including HEK 293, HeLa, HT-1080, DLD-1, A549, and COS-1 cells (1Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52747-52754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Further studies into the translocation of a GFP-tagged PKC βII revealed that this novel juxtanuclear translocation was not evident in all cell lines. Stimulation of HEK 293 cells with 100 nm PMA for 60 min induced an alteration in the localization of GFP-PKC βII from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and to the juxtanuclear compartment (Fig. 2A). In contrast, similar stimulation of MCF-7 resulted in translocation of GFP-PKC βII to the plasma membrane only with no detectable pericentriolar translocation (Fig. 2B). Time course experiments in MCF-7 cells revealed that this difference between the two cell lines was not because of a difference in the rate of translocation because further incubation with PMA for 3 or 6 h did not produce juxtanuclear translocation (data not shown). These results demonstrate cell-specific heterogeneity in the response of PKC to long term stimulation. PMA Induces the Formation of Ceramide in MCF-7 Cells but Not in HEK 293 Cells—It has been reported that the bioactive sphingolipid ceramide can inhibit both the activity and translocation of various classical PKC isoenzymes in both a short and long term manner (17Jones M.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5007-5013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2401-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Separately, it was reported that PMA can induce the accumulation/formation of ceramide in the prostate adenocarcinoma cell line LnCap cells but not in all prostate cancer cell lines (7Garzotto M. White-Jones M. Jiang Y. Ehleiter D. Liao W.C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate if phorbol ester stimulation leads to a selective increase in ceramide in MCF-7 cells but not in HEK, both cell types were labeled overnight with [3H]palmitate and then stimulated for 1 h with 100 nm PMA. As seen in Fig. 3A, 60 min of PMA led to an increase in ceramide in MCF-7 cells, and this was not seen in HEK 293 cells. The effects of PMA on ceramide in MCF-7 cells were also analyzed using LC/MS. The time course studies revealed that ceramide was increased to ∼130% of basal levels within 30 min of stimulation, and this ceramide increase remained sustained through 2 h of stimulation (Fig. 3B). As seen in Table I, levels of all of the ceramide species except C24-ceramide were increased under PMA stimulation, and notably the elevation of C16-ceramide was particularly pronounced with a greater than 2-fold induction at 60 min. Furthermore, as shown in Figs. 2 and 5, these alterations of very long (C24-ceramide) or long chain (C16) ceramide levels upon PMA stimulation in MCF-7 cells are consistent with what was observed in the lower or higher ceramide bands separated by thin layer chromatography, which correspond to C16-ceramide and C24-ceramide, respectively. These results demonstrate that PMA is able to induce the formation of ceramide in MCF-7 cells but not in HEK cells.Table IDistribution of ceramide species in MCF-7 cellsC14-CerdhC16-CerC16-CerC18:1-CerC18-CerC20-CerC24:1-CerC24-Cerpmol/mg proteinControl (0 min)16.3 ± 0.81.8 ± 0.3178.8 ± 3.43.9 ± 0.46.4 ± 0.48.8 ± 0.6246.8 ± 14.4235.1 ± 17.4Control (15 min)15.9 ± 1.02.1 ± 0.3165.8 ± 14.04.1 ± 0.36.6 ± 0.48.6 ± 0.4259.6 ± 10.5243.7 ± 11.8PMA (15 min)15.8 ± 0.52.5 ± 0.1170.9 ± 5.54.1 ± 0.27.1 ± 0.79.1 ± 0.3296.9 ± 17.5253.7 ± 14.3Control (30 min)15.2 ± 0.52.1 ± 0.1143.6 ± 3.84.0 ± 0.27.0 ± 0.48.4 ± 0.4288.1 ± 184251.3 ± 12.0PMA (30 min)23.6 ± 1.47.0 ± 0.7257.6 ± 22.46.5 ± 0.410.4 ± 0.311.8 ± 0.2375.3 ± 14.9315.6 ± 7.7Control (60 min)15.6 ± 0.32.5 ± 0.1133.9 ± 1.34.3 ± 0.17.1 ± 0.28.7 ± 0.6331.0 ± 12.7281.5 ± 13.2PMA (60 min)27.8 ± 0.59.7 ± 0.1304.4 ± 3.46.5 ± 0.111.8 ± 0.113.0 ± 0.1377.5 ± 2.7295.2 ± 19.2Control (120 min)17.3 ± 0.35.0 ± 0.4152.3 ± 12.24.1 ± 0.26.6 ± 0.47.7 ± 0.7308.0 ± 45.3252.4 ± 39.2PMA (120 min)30.0 ± 0.114.1 ± 0.2322.9 ± 0.56.1 ± 0.213.1 ± 0.313.5 ± 0.2398.9 ± 20266.2 ± 4.3 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5PMA-induced ceramide production in MCF-7 cells is inhibited by PKC inhibitors and fumonisin B1.

Cells were then stimulated with 0.01% Me2SO (DMSO) or 100 nm PMA for 60 min.

Both bands represent ceramide species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Juxtanuclear Translocation Is Inhibited by Endogenous and Exogenous Ceramide—As noted, PMA has also been shown to induce ceramide formation in LnCAP prostate cancer cells (7Garzotto M. White-Jones M. Jiang Y. Ehleiter D. Liao W.C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar), and we could not detect juxtanuclear translocation of PKC in response to PMA in LnCap cells (data not shown). These results suggested a correlation between ceramide formation and prevention of juxtanuclear translocation. Therefore, to investigate if ceramide could inhibit translocation of PKC βII to the juxtanuclear compartment, HEK 293 cells transfected with GFP-PKC βII were preincubated with 40 μm C6-ceramide for 8 h followed by 60 min of 100 nm PMA. In cells treated with PMA alone, there was translocation of GFP-PKC βII to the juxtanuclear compartment (Fig. 4A, panel 1). In contrast, pretreatment of cells with C6-ceramide prevented the juxtanuclear translocation in response to PMA (Fig. 4A, panel 2). To determine whether endogenous ceramide could accomplish a similar effect as exogenously added ceramide, HEK 293 cells transfected with GFP-PKC βII were pretreated for 30 min with 100 milliunits/ml bacterial SMase followed by 60 min PMA. Unlike cells treated with PMA alone, pretreatment with bacterial SMase led to an inhibition of juxtanuclear translocation (Fig. 4B, panels 1 and 2). These data show that endogenous ceramide can inhibit translocation of PKC βII to the pericentrion, raising the possibility that endogenous ceramide may be responsible for the lack of the PMA effect in MCF-7 cells. PMA-induced Ceramide Production in MCF-7 Cells Requires PKC Activity and Involves the Sphingolipid Salvage Pathway but Not de Novo Synthesis—It is well established that the major cellular receptor for PMA is PKC and that PMA exerts many of its cellular effects through stimulation of DAG/PMA-responsive PKC isoenzymes. Therefore, to determine whether PKC activity was required for the formation of ceramide, cells were steady-state labeled with [3H]palmitate and incubated in the presence of the PKC inhibitor, bisindoylmaleimide I. In cells treated with 3 μm bisindoylmaleimide I, there was complete abolition of ceramide production (Fig. 5A, panels 1–3). These data suggest that the ceramide increase is mediated by PKC and that this ceramide then modulates translocation of PKC. In previous studies in LnCAP cells, it was concluded that PMA induced ceramide formation through activation of the de novo pathway based on studies with FB1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase (7Garzotto M. White-Jones M. Jiang Y. Ehleiter D. Liao W.C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine the metabolic source and mechanism involved in ceramide generation, [3H]palmitate-labeled MCF-7 cells were treated with FB1, and the results showed that FB1 inhibited ceramide formation in response to PMA (Fig. 5B). Thus, the formation of ceramide in response to PMA requires activity of ceramide synthase. Because ceramide synthase acts on free sphingosine by catalyzing its acylation to ceramide, the action of FB1 in inhibiting this reaction does not distinguish between activation of the de novo pathway of sphingoid base formation or the generation of sphingosine from breakdown of complex sphingolipids, i.e. the salvage pathway (Fig. 1) (20van Merrill Jr., A.H. Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We undertook several approaches to distinguish the two possibilities. First, we employed myriocin which inhibits the initial step of the de novo pathway, the condensation of serine and palmitate. Cells pretreated with myriocin showed no inhibition of ceramide production in response to PMA (Fig. 5A, panels 4 and 5), thus favoring the action of the salvage and not the de novo pathway. To confirm that 100 nm myriocin inhibits de novo ceramide in our system, MCF-7 cells were pretreated for 1 h with myriocin and then labeled with 3 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate. In a dose-dependent manner, myriocin inhibited the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into MCF-7 cells with 65% inhibition at 100 nm (data not shown). To further discern between these two possibilities, the effects of PMA on palmitate labeling of ceramide were compared under a pulse protocol versus a chase condition. If PMA stimulates de novo synthesis of ceramide, then PMA should stimulate the acute incorporation of palmitate into ceramide when cells are simultaneously incubated with radiolabeled palmitate (pulse label). On the other hand, if PMA stimulates turnover of sphingolipids resulting in the formation of sphingosine as a breakdown product which is then acylated back to ceramide, then PMA would not stimulate the acute incorporation of palmitate. In that case, steady-state labeling of sphingolipids with palmitate (chase conditions) would then demonstrate enhanced labeling of ceramide in response to PMA. Therefore, MCF-7 cells were acutely labeled with palmitate and simultaneously treated with PMA (pulse conditions). Under these conditions, PMA did not enhance the incorporation of label into ceramide (Fig. 6A). In contradistinction, when cells were labeled with palmitate to steady state (24 h), PMA significantly induced ceramide formation after 60 min of treatment (Fig. 6A), demonstrating that PMA induces the accumulation of ceramide from pre-labeled precursors. Coincident with ceramide accumulation, PMA induced the accumulation of free sphingosine, which primarily derives from breakdown of complex sphingolipids. In contrast, free dihydrosphingosine, which arises predominantly through the de novo pathway, was depleted in response to PMA (Fig. 6B), suggesting selective enhancement of availability of free sphingosine/dihydrosphingosine for ceramide synthesis upon PMA stimulation. Taken together, the results implicate induction of the salvage pathway in response to PMA. Because the above studies suggested turnover of complex sphingolipids, we investigated the effects of PMA on sphingomyelin. Transient degradation of sphingomyelin was observed as early as 15 min following PMA treatment, and a significant change in the turnover was seen at the time point of 60 min (Fig. 6C). These very small changes in sphingomyelin are expected because the levels of sphingomyelin are ∼10-fold those of ceramide. Therefore, the results suggest induction of sphingomyelin turnover as the source of the formed ceramide. Fumonisin B1 Restores Juxtanuclear Translocation in MCF-7 Cells—The inhibition of PMA-induced ceramide formation by FB1 suggested that the absence of PKC translocation to the pericentrion in MCF-7 cells may be reversible. MCF-7 cells transfected with GFP-PKC βII were either treated with vehicle alone (PBS) or 200 μm FB1 for 6 h and then 60 min of 100 nm PMA. In cells pretreated with PBS alone, there was translocation of GFP-PKC βII to the plasma membrane only (Fig. 7, panels 1 and 2). An 8-h preincubation with FB1 resulted in the restoration of translocation of PKC βII to the pericentrion (Fig. 7, panel 3), thus suggesting a role for ceramide as the endogenous inhibitor of PKC translocation. However, ceramide may also get converted to glucosylceramide through the action of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), and the resulting glucosylceramide then serves as a precursor for the formation of complex glycosphingolipids. To examine for a possible role for glucosylceramide or glycosphingolipids in the inhibition of PKC βII juxtanuclear translocation, GCS was inhibited by using small interfering RNA (siRNA). As shown in Fig. 7, panel 6, PMA-induced translocation of GFP-PKC βII to the plasma membrane was not influenced by treatment with siRNA for GCS (under conditions where it inhibited formation of glucosylceramide). Therefore, downstream products of GCS do not appear to be involved in the juxtanuclear translocation of PKC βII. These data implicate the endogenous ceramide induced by PMA in the prevention of juxtanuclear translocation of PKC in MCF-7 cells. The results from this study define a negative feedback mechanism activated by PKC that results in inhibition of translocation of PKC βII to the juxtanuclear region/pericentrion. Thus, the results demonstrate the activation of PKC by PMA in MCF-7 cells causes the formation of ceramide, which in turn appears to be the mediator that inhibits the translocation of PKC βII to the juxtanuclear region but not to the plasma membrane. Specifically, the results from this study shed important light on a novel mechanism of ceramide formation. The results also provide evidence for a specific role of this pathway in negative regulation of PKC. Finally, the results add a new dimension to the emerging appreciation of pathway-specific actions of ceramide. Although the formation of ceramide through the activation of SMases or the de novo pathway has come under intense investigation, there are many outstanding questions as to the mechanisms that regulate these pathways. In particular, many of the studies implicating the de novo pathway have relied heavily on the ability of FB1 to inhibit ceramide synthase, a downstream enzyme along this pathway. However, it should be noted that ceramide synthase can act on substrates (dihydrosphingosine or sphingosine) that are generated either from activation of the de novo pathway or that are generated from hydrolysis of complex sphingolipids, a pathway termed the “salvage” pathway (Fig. 1) (20van Merrill Jr., A.H. Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results from this study clearly show that PMA activates the salvage pathway and not the de novo pathway. This conclusion is based on the following criteria. 1) Whereas FB1 inhibited ceramide formation, myriocin, a potent inhibitor of SPT, did not affect the response to PMA. SPT is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo pathway, and therefore its inhibition should abrogate the formation of downstream sphingolipids including ceramide. 2) The use of differential pulse and chase labeling was particularly revealing. Thus, PMA did not induce incorporation of palmitate into ceramide under pulse conditions, arguing against activation of de novo synthesis, whereas PMA induced significant incorporation of label into ceramide under chase conditions whereby the palmitate label was already incorporated into lipid precursors. 3) PMA caused an accumulation of sphingosine and not dihydrosphingosine. Notably, careful studies by Merrill et al. (20van Merrill Jr., A.H. Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have provided significant evidence that sphingosine, unlike dihydrosphingosine, arises primarily from the breakdown of complex sphingolipids and ceramide and not as an intermediate in the de novo pathway. This observation also supports activation of the salvage pathway by PMA. At this point, we can only speculate as to the mechanisms by which PMA caused a decrease in dihydrosphingosine. This is unlikely due to inhibition of the de novo pathway as we did not see a decrease in acute incorporation of palmitate into sphingolipids with PMA. It is more likely that PMA may activate ceramide (dihydroceramide) synthase as a component of activation of the salvage pathway. 4) Finally, the studies with choline labeling also demonstrate an effect of PMA on sphingomyelin levels and suggest activation of a sphingomyelinase. Although the changes in sphingomyelin were very modest, it should be noted that in MCF-7 cells a doubling of ceramide would require a decrease of only ∼10% in sphingomyelin levels. Taken together, these criteria implicate activation of the salvage pathway and not the de novo pathway. We also propose that these criteria can become valuable in dissecting out these two pathways in other situations where investigators have noted effects of FB1. It should be noted that other studies have shown the existence and operation of the salvage pathway in lipid metabolism (21Ogretmen B. Pettus B.J. Rossi M.J. Wood R. Usta J. Szulc Z. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12960-12969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22Chatelut M. Leruth M. Harzer K. Dagan A. Marchesini S. Gatt S.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The results from this study show that PKC activity is required for activation of this pathway in response to PMA, and thus, this represents the first description of regulation of sphingolipid salvage. Functionally, the results provide one specific consequence of activation of this pathway, i.e. inhibition of translocation of PKC βII to the juxtanuclear region. Thus, formation of endogenous ceramide by the action of bacterial SMase on membrane sphingomyelin was sufficient to inhibit the ability of PMA to induce juxtanuclear translocation of PKC in a cell line (HEK 293) that otherwise demonstrated this action. In complementing this conclusion, results with FB1 showed that endogenous ceramide formed in response to PMA was necessary for the block of PKC translocation in MCF7 cells. Thus, activation of the salvage pathway is both necessary and sufficient to inhibit juxtanuclear translocation of PKC. Most interestingly, however, this pathway is not activated by PMA/PKC in most cell lines. The mechanisms responsible for this selective activation may reflect roles of specific isoenzymes of PKC, and these are currently under investigation. The results also implicate ceramide itself and not other key metabolites in this response. For example, sphingosine levels increase with FB1, ruling out a role for further degradation of ceramide to sphingoid bases. Similarly, the response to PMA was not affected by down-regulation of glucosylceramide synthase, thus ruling out a key role for GCS or any of its downstream metabolites. However, at present, a role for other undefined metabolites of ceramide as the direct mediators of this response cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, it should be noted that formation of ceramide is required for inhibiting the PMA response irrespective of whether ceramide is the mediator per se. In the context of ceramide-mediated biology, these results begin to define specific pathways of ceramide generation with specific functions. For example, previous studies have shown that de novo generated ceramide in response to stimulation of the BcR receptor in B cells results in selective accumulation of C16-ceramide (23Kroesen B.J.

On the other hand, activation of neutral SMase2 was shown to selectively induce the formation of C24-ceramide and C24:1-ceramide, and evidence was provided for a role for this pathway in cell cycle regulation (25Marchesini N.

Chem. 2004; 279: 25101-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and in interleukin-6 formation (26Karakashian A.A. Giltiay N.V. Smith G.M. Nikolova-Karakashian M.N. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The current results provide a third specific pathway of ceramide formation with its own distinct function in regulating translocation of PKC. Previous studies have also disclosed additional effects of ceramide on PKC. For example, Lee et al. (18Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) showed that prolonged action of ceramide results in dephosphorylation and inactivation of PKCα, and this was attributed, at least in part, to the activation of sphingomyelinases. Thus, ceramide generated from different pathways may exert differential effects on PKC. Taken together, these results define a novel feedback pathway by which PKC activates sphingolipid salvage resulting in ceramide accumulation. This in turn inhibits translocation of PKC βII to the juxtanuclear region. We thank Dr. Jeff Jones for careful reading of the manuscript. We thank the Ralph H.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether dorsal interneurons specific for the spinal cord can be generated from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells using known inductive signals. Here we show that specific combination of developmental signaling molecules including all trans-retinoic acid, Shh, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), and Wnt3A can direct differentiation of ES cells into dorsal interneurons possessing appropriate neuronal markers, synaptic proteins and functional neurotransmitter machineries. We introduce a concept that Wnt3A morphogenic action relies on crosstalk with both Shh and BMP2 signaling pathways."

However, the signaling mechanisms of LPS-induced COX-2 expression in cardiomyocytes are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of gp91(phox)-containing NADH oxidase signaling pathway in LPS-induced COX-2 expression in cardiomyocytes. Cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes showed basal COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. In response to LPS, COX-2 expression and PGE2 production increased by two- to four-fold, which were completely blocked by a selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398. LPS also increased NADH oxidase (gp91(phox) and p47(phox) subunits) expression and superoxide generation. Deficiency of gp91(phox) or suppression of p22(phox) expression decreased NADH oxidase activity and down-regulated COX-2 expression and PGE2 production stimulated by LPS. Pharmacological inhibitors of NADH oxidase prevented LPS-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. The effect of NADH oxidase was mediated through MAPK activation, since inhibition of NADH-oxidase activity prevented phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2, as well as selective inhibition of each subfamily of MAPK by siRNAs and a dominant negative mutant of JNK1 decreased COX-2 expression and completely abrogated PGE2 production in response to LPS. Furthermore, LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation was decreased by inhibition of NADH oxidase, ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 activation, suggesting that LPS increases NF-kappaB activity and COX-2 expression via NADH oxidase-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2. In conclusion, NADH oxidase signaling represents a novel pathway leading to COX-2 expression via MAPK/NF-kappaB-dependent mechanisms in cardiomyocytes during LPS stimulation. Our study suggests that gp91(phox)-containing NADH oxidase is a potential therapeutic target of sepsis."

Unique Increases of PtdIns 3,5-P2 in Differentiated 3T3-L1 Adipocytes by Hyperosmotic Stress—While examining the phosphoinositide profiles in fully differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes and a possible acute regulation by extracellular stimuli, we have observed a dramatic increase in PtdIns 3,5-P2 levels, reaching up to 10-fold, in response to acute hyperosmotic stress (Fig. 1). This result was quite surprising since previous studies in yeast and other mammalian cell types have documented that only the former, but not the latter, respond to hyperosmotic stress by a robust rise in PtdIns 3,5-P2 levels (13Dove S.K.

This unexpected elevation of PtdIns 3,5-P2 accumulation was manifested in both [32P]orthophosphate-labeled (Fig. 1A) or myo-[3H]inositol-labeled 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1C). As in yeast (13Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell T.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), the PtdIns 3,5-P2 rise in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to hyperosmotic stress was transient, with a peak at about 10 min and a return toward the basal levels at ∼60 min (Fig. 1C). Quantitation from five independent HPLC inositol-head-group analyses in [32P]orthophosphate-labeled 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with sorbitol (10 min) estimated an average of a 3-fold increase in [32P]PtdIns 3,5-P2 accumulation (Table I).Table IHyperosmotic stress induces 32P-PtdIns 3,5-P2 accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes but not in the precursor fibroblastsPI spcTreatment3T3-L1 adipocytes3T3-L1 fibroblastsHEK293 cellsPtdIns 3,5-P2PtdIns 3-PPtdIns 3,5-P2PtdIns 3-PPtdIns 3,5-P2PtdIns 3-P% Total% Total% Total% Total% Total% TotalControl0.14 ± 0.051.11 ± 0.141.08 ± 0.063.84 ± 0.420.26 ± 0.051.57 ± 0.02Sorbitol0.42 ± 0.042.53 ± 0.370.52 ± 0.056.08 ± 0.580.22 ± 0.021.55 ± 0.15 Open table in a new tab Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes display not only quite different morphology from their fibroblastic precursors but also develop adipocyte-specific signaling pathways not observed in the precursor cell line. To assess the possibility that the elevated PtdIns 3,5-P2 is part of a novel adipocyte-specific hyperosmotic regulatory mechanism, we examined the effect of hyperosmolarity on radiolabeled PtdIns 3,5-P2 accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate just before initiation of the differentiation program. Remarkably, the precursor cell line not only failed to show a rise in the accumulated [32P]PtdIns 3,5-P2 in response to hyperosmotic stress but even showed a 2-fold decline in [32P]-PtdIns 3,5-P2 (Table I). Whereas PtdIns 3,5-P2 levels were changed in opposite directions, hyperosmolarity similarly increased the levels of PtdIns 3-P in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Table I; Fig. 1). This result indicates that the increased [32P]PtdIns 3,5-P2 accumulation results from an activation of a distinct pathway that operates specifically in hyperosmotically stressed differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and does not simply mirror the concomitant PI 3-kinase activation and the rise of PtdIns 3-P, the substrate for PtdIns 3,5-P2 intracellular synthesis (12Whiteford C.C. Brearley C.A. Ulug E.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell T.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). PtdIns 3-P has been previously shown to increase in hyperosmotically stressed Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts; however, PtdIns 3,5-P2 was not examined in this study (38Van Der Kaay J. Beck M. Gray A. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35963-35968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To relate the differential changes in PtdIns 3,5-P2 accumulation seen in hyperosmotically stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and preadipocytes to a different cell type, we subjected metabolically labeled HEK293 cells to a similar analysis. As illustrated in Table I, hyperosmotic stress in this cell type was associated with a tendency for a decrease in accumulated amounts of [32P]PtdIns 3,5-P2, whereas levels of [32P]PtdIns 3-P remained practically unaltered. Noteworthy, whereas both the [32P]PtdIns 4-P and [32P]PtdIns 4,5-P2 accumulation slightly changed by hyperosmolarity (1–10%; data not shown), the direction and magnitude of these alterations were roughly comparable among the 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and HEK293 cells. Together these data indicate that the transition into the adipocyte phenotype is associated with the acquisition of a unique rise in PtdIns 3,5-P2 accumulation in response to acute hyperosmotic stress. Similar Activation of p38 MAP Kinase in Different Mammalian Cell Types by Hyperosmotic Stress—Hyperosmotic stress is a potent inducer of p38 MAP kinase (39Rinco ́n M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2833) Google Scholar). We, therefore, sought to link the differential hyperosmotic effect on the PtdIns 3,5-P2 levels observed among the cell types studied herein with a potential differential activation of p38 MAP kinase. However, we have observed a similar extent of the hyperosmotic-induced p38 MAP kinase activation in the three cell types as revealed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-p38-specific antibodies (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with the notion that the p38 pathway most likely does not govern the 3T3-L1 adipocyte-specific rise in PtdIns 3,5-P2 in response to hyperosmolarity. This conclusion is in agreement with genetic studies in yeast (13Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell T.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), which failed to relate hyperosmotically induced PtdIns 3,5-P2 to activation of Hog1, the yeast ortholog of mammalian p38 MAP kinase. ArPIKfyve-PIKfyve Axis in Hyperosmotically Increased PtdIns 3,5-P2 in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—We have previously identified that steady-state levels of PtdIns 3,5-P2 produced by PIKfyve-catalyzed synthesis from PtdIns 3-P require an upstream activator, ArPIKfyve, that physically associates with and activates PIKfyve (9Ikonomov O.C.

These lesions are highly cytotoxic and mutagenic, and their removal is mediated by homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (1Krejci L. Chen L. Van Komen S. Sung P.

Genetic and biochemical studies have led to the identification of many components of these two DNA repair pathways. Although HR and NHEJ mostly involve unique sets of protein factors, the yeast Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 (RMX) complex has been implicated in both pathways (1Krejci L. Chen L. Van Komen S. Sung P. Tomkinson A.

Genetic studies indicate that the Mre11 nuclease activity is important for the processing of meiotic DSBs made by Spo11 and possibly telomere maintenance (5Moreau S. Ferguson J.R. Symington L. Mol.

The nuclease function of the RMX complex is among several redundant activities that resect DSBs in mitotic cells to yield single-stranded DNA tails to be used by the HR machinery to initiate recombinational repair (1Krejci L.

Accordingly, the DNA damage sensitivity of strains lacking a functional RMX complex can be suppressed by overexpressing ExoI, a 5′-to-3′ exonuclease (12Lewis L.K. Karthikeyan G. Westmorland J.W.

Furthermore, the presence of protein-protein interaction modules in Xrs2/Nbs1 implicates it in the recruitment of other protein factors (25Varon R. Vissinga C. Platzer M. Cerosaletti K.M.

In support of this notion, a physical interaction between Xrs2 and the Lif1 subunit of Dnl4/Lif1 has been demonstrated (13Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that Xrs2 is a DNA structure-specific-binding protein and that it is indispensable for DNA end engagement and ATP-dependent DNA unwinding by the RMX complex (10Trujillo K. Roh D.H. Chen L. Komen VanS. Tomkinson A. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48957-48964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to determine how ATP influences the biological functions of Rad50 and the RMX complex. Importantly, mutations that alter the conserved lysine residue in the Walker type A motif of yeast Rad50 impair both HR and NHEJ. Biochemically, the rad50 Walker mutations inactivate the ATPase activity of the RMX complex and lead to the loss of the ATP-dependent DNA structure-specific endonuclease and DNA unwinding activities of this complex as well. Even though the DNA end binding and end-bridging activities of the RMX complex are not influenced by ATP, we demonstrate that the Walker A motif itself is important for DNA end-bridging and DNA end-joining when a physiological level of salt is present. Our results provide molecular information concerning the role of ATP in RMX functions and also implicate the region in Rad50 protein that encompasses the Walker A motif in DNA end-bridging and DNA end-joining independent of ATP. Construction of Yeast Strains—The strain W1588-4C (MATa ade2-1 can1-100 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3-1 trp1-1 RAD5) was used for the integration of mutant alleles at the RAD50 locus. The integrating plasmids with mutations in the codon for lysine 40 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of YIp5::RAD50 containing the RAD50 open reading frame inserted in the BamHI site and carrying the URA3 marker. The rad50 mutant alleles were sequenced to ensure that no unintended mutation had been introduced during handling. Plasmids harboring the rad50 mutations were linearized with BglII and used to transform W1588-4C. After selecting for Ura+ transformants, cells were grown non-selectively and then streaked on 5-FOA plates. FOA-resistant colonies were irradiated with γ-rays and sensitive clones were examined for the presence of the rad50 mutations by PCR amplification and sequencing of the genomic region surrounding the RAD50 K40 site. γ-Irradiation—This was supplied by a 137cesium source. Three cultures of each strain were grown overnight, diluted to a titer of 5 × 106 cells per ml, and shaken for 3 h at 30 °C prior to each assay to ensure that cells were in log phase. Plasmid/Chromosome Recombination Assays—To assess mitotic recombination proficiency, wild type and mutant derivatives of W1588-4C cells were transformed separately with 200 ng of control vector pRS313 (CEN/ARS HIS3) (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 400 ng of BclI-cut pLKL37Y (URA3 HIS3) integrating plasmid. The plasmid pLKL37Y was purified from the dam– Escherichia coli strain SCS110 (Stratagene) to allow cleavage by BclI, which is sensitive to dam methylation. BclI cleaves at nt 549 of HIS3 on pLKL37Y to produce a fragment that can recombine with the chromosomal his3-11,15 allele and generate URA3 HIS3 integrants (12Lewis L.K. Karthikeyan G. Westmorland J.W. Resnick M.A. Genetics. 2002; 160: 49-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombination frequencies (His+ Ura+ recombinants per microgram of transforming DNA) were normalized to pRS313 (His+) transformation efficiencies using the same competent cell preparations. Three cultures of each strain were transformed and the results averaged. Recombination frequencies are shown as a percentage of the frequency of the isogenic wild-type strain. Plasmid End-joining Assay—These assays were performed essentially as described (29Teo S.H. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4788-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Strains W1588-4C; DR50 (rad50Δ); DHY201 (rad50 K40A); DHY202 (rad50 K40R), and DHY203 (rad50 K40E) were transformed separately with uncut pBTM116 (CEN, ADH, TRP1) and EcoRI-linearized pBTM116. The transformation efficiency for the linearized plasmid was normalized to the transformation efficiency obtained with the uncut supercoiled plasmid DNA, using 3–4 cultures for each strain. Protein Purification and Assembly of Wild Type and Mutant Variants of the RMX Complex—The Rad50, Mre11, and Xrs2 proteins were individually purified from yeast and assembled into the trimeric RMX complex as described previously (9Trujillo K. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol.

For overexpression of the Rad50 K40A, K40E, and K40R proteins in yeast, the corresponding mutant alleles were placed under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL-PGK promoter in vector pPM231 (2μ, GAL-PGK, LEU-2d) (9Trujillo K. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids (pR50.K40A.1, pR50.K40E.1, and pR50.K40R.1) were each introduced into the protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5464 (MATα, ura3–52, trp-1, leu2Δ, his3Δ200, pep4::HIS3, prbΔ1.6R), and the mutant proteins purified by the same procedure devised for wild-type Rad50 (9Trujillo K. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant Rad50 proteins were assembled into protein complexes as described previously (9Trujillo K. Sung P. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The concentration of proteins and protein complexes was determined by densitometric scanning of Coomassie Blue-stained 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) that contained different loadings of the proteins and protein complexes with known amounts of bovine serum albumin as the comparison standard. ATPase Assay—Purified wild-type and mutant RMX complexes (1.2 μm of each) were incubated with 150 μm [γ-32P]ATP and ϕX174 (+) strand (22 μm nucleotides) at 30 °C in 10 μl of buffer A (30 mm Bis-Tris pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm MgCl2). At the indicated times, an aliquot (2 μl) was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 1% SDS to halt the reaction. The level of ATP hydrolysis was determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC), as described (31Petukhova G.S. Stratton S.A. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). DNA Substrates—To construct the substrate for the DNA binding experiments, the 5′-end of the 83-mer oligonucleotide: 5′-TTG ATA AGA GGT CAT TTT TGC GGA TGG CTT AGA GCT TAA TTG CTG AAT CTG GTG CTG TAG CTC AAC ATG TTT TAA ATA TGC AA-3′ was radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). The polynucleotide kinase was inactivated by heating the reaction mixture to 75 °C for 15 min, and unincorporated nucleotide was removed with a Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad). The labeled oligonucleotide was annealed with its exact complement and the 83-base pair duplex was purified from a 10% native polyacrylamide gel by overnight diffusion at 4 °C into TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA). To make topologically relaxed DNA, ϕX174 replicative form I DNA (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) was treated with calf thymus topoisomerase I (Invitrogen), followed by purification of the relaxed DNA species from agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, as described (32Van Komen, S., Petukhova, G., Sigurdsson, S., Stratton, S., and Sung, P. (200) Mol. Cell 6, 563–572Google Scholar). The relaxed DNA was stored in TAE buffer. Topological DNA Unwinding Assay—Wild type and mutant RMX complexes (1 μm of each) were incubated with topologically relaxed DNA (3 μm nucleotides) for 5 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of Buffer A containing 2 mm ATP. Under these conditions, the nuclease activity of Mre11 is dormant (8Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 9Trujillo K. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Calf thymus topoisomerase I (3 units; Invitrogen) was then added, and incubation continued for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped and deproteinized by incubation with SDS (0.5%) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C. DNA species were resolved by electrophoresis in 0.9% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Endonuclease Assay—The DNA hairpin (HP2) with ssDNA overhangs was labeled at the 3′-end as described previously (9Trujillo K. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This substrate (120 nm nucleotides) was incubated with 400 nm of the wild-type and mutant RMX complexes at 4 °C in 10 μl of Buffer A containing 1 mm ATP and 5 mm MnCl2 instead of MgCl2. After 40 min at 37 °C, the reaction was halted by the addition of SDS and proteinase K (0.2% and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively). After separation by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, radiolabeled DNA species were detected in the dried gel by phosphorimaging analysis (9Trujillo K. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Exonuclease Assay—A 3′-end-labeled 74-bp duplex DNA substrate was generated by the hybridization of complementary oligonucleotides as described previously (9Trujillo K. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This duplex (7.4 μm nucleotides) was incubated with 20 nm of the wild type and mutant RMX complexes at 4 °C in 10 μl of Buffer A that contained 5 mm MnCl2 instead of MgCl2. At the times indicated, an aliquot (2 μl) was removed and deproteinized by incubation with SDS (0.2%) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. After separation by TLC, the plates were air-dried and 32P-labeled molecules detected by phosphorimaging analysis. In Vitro DNA End-joining Assay—Linear 400-bp DNA fragments with either 5′ or 3′ complementary single-stranded ends were generated and end-labeled as described (33Chen L. Trujillo K. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26196-26205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Labeled DNA substrates (0.75 nm DNA molecules) were incubated with Dnl4/Lif1 (4 nm) and, where indicated, the wild-type RMX complex or one of the mutant RMX complexes (6 nm of each) in reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 25 °C. Reactions were deproteinized by phenol/chloroform extraction. After separation by agarose gel electrophoresis, the labeled DNA substrates and products were visualized by phosphorimaging analysis of the dried gel. Lambda Exonuclease Protection Assay—A 400-bp duplex with complementary 5′ single-stranded ends was labeled with 32P as described (33Chen L. Trujillo K. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26196-26205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The labeled substrate (38 nm DNA ends) was incubated with or without 100 nm of the wild-type and mutant RMX complexes in 10 μlof 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm KCl. After 5 min at room temperature, λ exonuclease (0.1 unit) was added to the reaction mixture. At the indicated times, an aliquot (1.5 μl) was removed and treated with SDS (0.2%) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) to deproteinize the reaction. After separation by TLC, the 32P-labeled molecules were detected by phosphorimaging analysis. DNA Mobility Shift Assays—The indicated amounts of the wild-type and mutant RMX complexes were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with the radiolabeled 83-mer duplex substrate (1.5 μm nucleotides) in 10 μl buffer A containing 2 mm ATP. The reaction mixtures were analyzed in 9% native polyacrylamide gels run in Tris acetate/EDTA buffer at 4 °C. The gels were dried and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. Where indicated, deproteinization was done by incubating reaction mixtures with SDS (0.2%) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 5 min. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)—AFM was performed using a Nanoscope Scanning Probe system (Digital Instruments Inc.) in the tapping mode, as described previously (33Chen L. Trujillo K. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26196-26205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A 400-bp DNA fragment with 5′-cohesive ends (20 nm) and either wild-type or mutant RMX complex (25 nm of each) were incubated in 15 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and the indicated concentration of KCl on ice for 10 min. Subsequently, the sample was diluted with an equal volume of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) and 10 mm MgCl2 and applied to freshly cleaved mica. After 1 min at room temperature, the mica was washed with filter-sterilized distilled water and dried with a stream of filtered air before being imaged. Mutations in the Walker A Motif of Rad50 Cause Hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging Agents—Rad50 protein is a DNA-dependent ATPase (9Trujillo K. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and binds DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (18Raymond W.E. Kleckner N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3851-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To elucidate how ATP regulates the functions of Rad50 and the RMX complex, we changed the conserved lysine residue (Lys40) in the Walker A motif of Rad50 to arginine (K40R), alanine (K40A), and glutamic acid (K40E) by site-directed mutagenesis. Yeast strains in which the RAD50 gene was replaced by the three mutant alleles were as sensitive as the isogenic rad50Δ strain to killing by ionizing radiation (IR) (Fig. 1A) and by methyl methanesulfonate (Fig. 1C). As expected, the DNA damage sensitivity of the rad50 mutants was fully complemented by the wild-type RAD50 gene but not the XRS2 gene (Fig. 1B). By contrast, replacement of the RAD50 gene with the rad50S allele (K81I), which is defective in the removal of Spo11 from DNA double strand breaks during meiosis (34Cao L. Alani E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1089-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), did not confer increased sensitivity to DNA damage (data not shown). Recently, it was shown that overexpression of ExoI, a 5′-to-3′ exonuclease (35Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7487-7492Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), suppressed the DNA damage hypersensitivity of rad50, mre11, and xrs2 strains (12Lewis L.K. Karthikeyan G. Westmorland J.W. Resnick M.A. Genetics. 2002; 160: 49-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of ExoI also suppressed the DNA damage hypersensitivity of rad50 K40A, rad50 K40R, and rad50 K40E strains although not quite to the same extent as the rad50Δ strain (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the presence of a defective Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex may hinder ExoI activity. rad50 Walker A Mutants Are Compromised for Recombinational DNA Repair—Since inactivation of NHEJ in Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not cause an appreciable increase in sensitivity to ionizing radiation, it appears that defects in recombinational repair mechanisms underlie the hypersensitivity of rad50 strains (1Krejci L. Chen L. Van Komen S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Progress Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 75: 159-201Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem.

Based on the survival curves of the rad50 Walker mutant strains, we predicted that these strains would also be defective in homologous recombination. To test this idea, we used an assay that measures homologous integration of a linearized plasmid molecule (12Lewis L.K. Karthikeyan G. Westmorland J.W. Resnick M.A. Genetics. 2002; 160: 49-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As anticipated, the rad50 K40A, rad50 K40R, and rad50 K40E mutants exhibited a marked defect in plasmid integration similar to that of the rad50Δ strain (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the rad50S strain was only slightly impaired (data not shown). Rad50 Walker A Mutants Are Defective in DNA End-joining—Although inactivation of NHEJ in yeast does not cause a significant increase in sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, defects in this pathway do result in a reduced ability to recircularize linearized plasmid DNA molecules (2Boulton S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2020477648,"The thymidylate synthase inhibitor 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is used widely for chemotherapy of colorectal carcinoma. Recent studies showed that 5-FU affects polyamine metabolism in colon carcinoma cells. We therefore examined whether combinations of 5-FU with drugs that specifically target polyamine metabolism, i.e. N1,N11-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM) or α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), have synergistic effects in killing HCT116 colon carcinoma cells with wild-type or absent p53. Our results showed that simultaneous 5-FU and DENSPM, a spermine analogue, synergistically increased transcript levels of the polyamine catabolism enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, depleted spermine and spermidine, increased acetylated spermidine, and produced synergistic tumor cell apoptosis in both p53 wild-type and p53-null variants. By contrast, simultaneous combination of 5-FU with DFMO, an inhibitor of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase, depleted putrescine but did not produce synergistic cell killing. Some pre-treatment and post-treatment regimens of DENSPM and DFMO were antagonistic to 5-FU depending on cellular p53 status. Protein and transcriptome expression analysis showed that combined 5-FU and DENSPM treatment activated caspase 9, but not caspase 3, and significantly suppressed NADH dehydrogenases and cytochrome c oxidases, consistent with the observed increase in hydrogen peroxide, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and release of cytochrome c.

Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Our recent functional genomic studies have rediscovered that 5-FU also affects polyamine pathways to reduce the levels of polyamines in treated colon cancer cells (10Zhang W. Ramdas L. Shen W. Song S.W. Hu L. Hamilton S.R. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), an observation that was originally made by Russell et al. in 1974 in a liver cancer xenograft mouse model (11Russell D.H. Looney W.B. Kovacs C.J. Hopkins H.A. Marton L.J. LeGendre S.M. Morris H.P. Cancer Res. 1974; 34: 2382-2385PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that 5-FU targets two major cellular processes, i.e. polyamine metabolism as well as processing and synthesis of DNA and RNA. These two processes may have intimate inter-relationships because polyamines bind DNA and RNA and affect chromosomal structure, RNA stability, and translation (12Snyder R.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Spermidine, spermine, and their diamine precursor putrescine are natural polyamines in living organisms and play critical roles in proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis in both normal and cancer cells. The balance between polyamine biosynthesis and catabolism is tightly regulated to maintain cellular polyamine levels. Mice with disrupted genes important for polyamine biosynthesis, such as ornithine decarboxylase, die early in embryonic development (13Pendeville H. Carpino N. Marine J.C. Takahashi Y. Muller M. Martial J.A. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6549-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Insufficient levels of polyamines result in retarded cell growth and sometimes cell death. Therefore, cellular polyamine depletion through inhibition of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway has been used for chemotherapeutic intervention (14Elmore E. Stringer D.E. Steele V.E. Gerner E.W. Redpath J.L. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 1163-1165PubMed Google Scholar, 15Subhi A.L. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. Tang B. Lu Z.J. Markham G.D. Kruger W.D. J. Biol.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). DFMO, which is a suicide inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, the enzyme that decarboxylates ornithine to produce putrescine, is a well studied inhibitor of the biosynthetic pathway. However, clinical trials using DFMO yielded disappointing results (17Fabian C.J. Kimler B.F. Brady D.A. Mayo M.S. Chang C.H. Ferraro J.A. Zalles C.M. Stanton A.L. Masood S. Grizzle W.E. Boyd N.F.

Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3878-3884PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps because polyamines are often present at high levels in human diet and intestinal lumen, thus bypassing the suppression of polyamine biosynthesis (20Sarhan S. Knodgen B. Seiler N. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 457-466PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because of the low toxicity of DFMO, it has been tested as a chemopreventive agent for colon carcinoma (21Meyskens Jr., F.L. Gerner E.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 945-951PubMed Google Scholar). Interest in polyamine metabolism has shifted to its catabolism, especially because catabolism has been associated with the anti-tumor effects of several polyamine analogues. DENSPM is an analogue of spermine that has been shown to deplete polyamines by inducing expression of the polyamine catabolism enzyme SSAT through Nrf-2 and polyamine-modulated factor-1 interaction on the SSAT promoter (22Wang Y. Xiao L. Thiagalingam A. Nelkin B.D. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34623-34630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Wang Y. Devereux W. Stewart T.M. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22095-22101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). SSAT acetylates spermine and spermidine, which in turn are substrates for a flavin-dependent polyamine oxidase to produce hydrogen peroxide that is believed to account for the cytotoxicity of DENSPM (24Ha H.C. Woster P.M. Yager J.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 25Chen Y. Kramer D.L. Diegelman P. Vujcic S. Porter C.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6437-6444PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cytotoxic effect of DENSPM is not observed in all cell types and is often observed only after long exposure, suggesting that the cytotoxicity of DENSPM alone is not very potent. In this study, we investigated whether combinations of 5-FU with drugs that modulate polyamine metabolism may have synergistic effects in inducing colon cancer cell apoptosis. In addition, to evaluate the role of p53 in the response to combination therapy, we used two isogenic HCT116 colon cancer cell lines that were either wild-type for p53 (wt-p53) or had the p53 gene deleted (p53-null) (26Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar). Reagents—5-FU, DFMO, and antioxidant GSH were purchased from Sigma, and DENSPM was purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MI). 5-FU was dissolved in Me2SO, and DFMO and DENSPM were dissolved in water according to the manufacturer's instructions. CM-H2DCFDA and Rho123 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and dissolved in Me2SO. Cell Culture—The isogenic HCT116 cell lines with wt-p53 or p53-null background were provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University). The cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% Nu-serum (Collaborative Research Products, Bedford, MA) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Because fetal bovine serum has abundant thymine and polyamines, we used dialyzed serum to remove these moieties that would interfere with the experimental results. Later experiments showed that fetal bovine serum did not affect the pattern of cellular responses but did shift the dose of drugs required to achieve the same results (data not shown). MTS Cell Viability Assay—CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, G358B, Madison, WI) was used to detect viable cells in cytotoxicity experiments. After 20 μl of MTS solution were added into each well, the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2 h before absorbance at 490 nm was measured with a Micro-plate reader (MRX, Danatech Laboratory, Houston, TX). All the MTS assays included 3 to 5 replicates for each treatment condition, and the experiments were repeated at least twice. Drug Treatment Experiments—A total of 3000 cells per well in a volume of 100 μl were plated in each 96-well plate. On the second day, various concentrations of 5-FU were added to the wells, and MTS assays were performed to estimate IC25 values (2.5 μm for HCT116 wt-p53 and 15 μm for HCT116 p53-null). Twenty-four hours after the initial cell seeding, the IC25 dose of 5-FU alone or combinations with various concentrations of DENSPM (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μm) were added. Three different dosing schedules were evaluated. The post-5-FU schedule was 5-FU for 48 h followed by DENSPM for 48 h; the pre-5-FU schedule was DENSPM for 48 h followed by 5-FU for 48 h; and the simultaneous schedule was 5-FU and DENSPM together for 48 h followed by medium alone for 48 h. After drug exposure, the MTS assay was used to measure cell viability. Measurement of Cellular Levels of Polyamines—Treated cells were collected and lysed. The polyamine concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (28Tome M.E. Fiser S.M. Payne C.M. Gerner E.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry—Cells were seeded in a 10-cm2 dish (one million cells/dish) in 10 ml of medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. After 24 h at 37 °C, drugs were added for 72 h. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested by trypsinization and centrifugation, fixed with 70% of ethanol, and then stained with propidium iodide with RNase, followed by analysis on a FACS-Calibur instrument (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) with CELL Quest software. Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Methods for SSAT Expression—SSAT and 18 S rRNA were quantitated using the Applied Biosystem TaqMan method in conjunction with Assays-On-Demand (ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR mixture consisted of Taqman Master Mix (without uracil-N-glycosylase), MultiScribe reverse transcriptase, RNase inhibitors, and 10 ng of total RNA in a final volume of 50 μl. Thermal cycling was initiated with reverse transcription at 48 °C for 30 min and the Taq Gold activation step at 95 °C for 10 min. The thermal profile for the PCR was 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Data were obtained during 40 cycles of amplification. PCR were performed in triplicate for SSAT with 18 S as an internal standard. The levels of SSAT in drug-treated samples relative to untreated control were determined. Microarray Methods for Transcriptome Analysis—Total RNA was isolated, labeled, and hybridized as described (29Hu L. Wang J. Baggerly K. Wang H. Fuller G.N. Hamilton S.R. Coombes K.R. Zhang W. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After being washed, the slides were scanned with a GeneTAC UC 4 laser scanner (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI), and the signal intensities were quantified with ArrayVision™ (Imaging Research Inc., St. Catherine's, Ontario, Canada). The data were analyzed using the in-house program for microarray analysis (30Baggerly K.A. Coombes K.R. Hess K.R. Stivers D.N. Abruzzo L.V. Zhang W. J. Comput. Biol. 2001; 8: 639-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Each differentially expressed gene was determined from a cutoff value of its T value. Generally, a cutoff value of 3 was considered to be statistically significant based on the statistical variations (30Baggerly K.A. Coombes K.R. Hess K.R. Stivers D.N. Abruzzo L.V. Zhang W. J. Comput. Biol. 2001; 8: 639-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The pathway array includes 2,016 functionally well characterized genes involved in cell death, cell growth, metabolism, cell invasion, cell communication, immune response, DNA repair, and transcription (generated by the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Genomics Core Laboratory, www3.mdanderson.org/~genomics). GoMiner was used (discover.nci.nih.gov/gominer) for the analysis of functional gene groups. Western Blotting—Total cellular protein extract was isolated from harvested cells, protein concentration was determined, and Western blotting was carried out as described previously (31Fuller G.N. Rhee C.H. Hess K.R. Caskey L.S. Wang R. Bruner J.M. Yung W.K. Zhang W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4228-4232PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies used were anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Ab-6, Oncogene Science, Manhasset, NY), anti-p21Waf1 mouse hybridoma (a gift from Dr. Wade Harper at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), anti-caspase 3 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-mdm2, anti-cyclin A2, anti-cyclin B1, anti-Fas, anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and antibody for cleaved caspase 9 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Cytochrome c Release Assay—Drug-treated cells were harvested for separation of mitochondria and cytosol by use of ApoAlert™ cell fractionation kit (BD Biosciences) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Antibody for cytochrome c included in the kit was used in Western blotting analysis. Cellular Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) Staining Assay—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with 5-FU and DENSPM for 48 h. CM-H2DCFDA was applied to the cells at 1 μm final concentration and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested with trypsin and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Ten thousand cells were analyzed on the FACS-Calibur instrument (BD Biosciences) with CELL Quest Pro software. Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (Δψm) Assay—Cells were treated with Rho123 at 100 nm final concentration to detect the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Statistical Analysis—The effect of drug combinations was analyzed using median effect algorithms developed by Chou and Talalay (32Chou T.C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (5891) Google Scholar). Dose-response interactions (antagonism, additivity, synergism) between 5-FU and DENSPM were expressed as a combination index (CI) for every fraction affected. A CI value that is smaller than 1 indicates synergism, a CI value higher than 1 indicates antagonism, and a CI value of 1 indicates additivity. Differences in means were evaluated by two-tailed t test assuming unequal variances. Synergism by Combination of 5-FU with DENSPM—As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of both wt-p53 and p53-null HCT116 cells with combined 5-FU and DENSPM markedly reduced tumor cell viability. For wt-p53 cells, 5-FU and DENSPM had a strong synergistic effect, with a Chou and Talalay CI value in the range of 0.3–0.6. Moderate synergistic effect (0.7 < CI < 0.85) was seen with a post-5-FU schedule of initial 5-FU followed by DENSPM. Interestingly, an antagonistic effect was observed when the wt-p53 cells were pre-treated with DENSPM followed by 5-FU. In p53-null cells, simultaneous drug treatment also had the most synergistic effect, whereas pretreatment with DENSPM before 5-FU had an antagonistic effect. Flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 2) indicated that simultaneous treatment in both isogenic lines resulted in a marked increase of the apoptotic sub-G1 population, indicating cytotoxic effect and apoptosis. Absence of p53 alleles in the null cells appeared to reduce apoptosis in response to either DENSPM alone or the combination treatment. In contrast to the results for 5-FU with DENSPM, the combination of 5-FU with DFMO did not produce synergistic cell killing (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Effects of combined 5-FU and ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor DFMO on colon carcinoma cells. HCT116 colon cancer cells were treated with 5-FU at 2.5 μm (IC25 for wt-p53 line) or 15 μm (IC25 for p53-null line) in combination with increasing doses of DFMO (simultaneous or one drug following the other). Cell viability at the 96-h end point was measured with MTS assay. A, dose-response curves. The straight line at around 70% viability shows the effect by 5-FU alone. The four curves represent different regimens: •, DFMO alone; ▴, 5-FU + DFMO (simultaneous treatment for 48 h and drug-free medium for 48 h); ▪, DFMO (48 h) then 5-FU (48 h); ○, 5-FU (48 h) then DFMO (48 h). No combination (simultaneous treatment, DFMO post-treatment, or DFMO pre-treatment) produced synergistic cytotoxicity. Some pre-treatment and post-treatment regiments of DFMO are antagonistic to 5-FU depending on the p53 status. DFMO post-treatment and DFMO pre-treatment had the strongest antagonistic effects in wt-p53 and p53-null lines, respectively. B, analysis of the combination effect of 5-FU and DFMO using the Chou and Talalay CI. Dose-response interactions between 5-FU and DFMO were expressed as a CI value (CI < 1: synergism, CI = 1: additivity, CI > 1: antagonism). Simultaneous treatment with 5-FU and DFMO only had additive effects in most regimens. 5-FU followed by DFMO had a strong antagonistic effect in the wt-p53 cells and DFMO followed by 5-FU had a strong antagonistic effect in the p53-null cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Depletion of Polyamines and Accumulation of Acetylated Spermidine by Combined 5-FU and DENSPM Treatment— 5-FU at the IC25 dose did not markedly reduce polyamines. DENSPM decreased the levels of spermidine and spermine as expected, but increased the putrescine level (Fig. 4). However, the combination treatment with 5-FU and DENSPM produced a marked reduction in spermidine and spermine in tumor cells. The levels of acetylated spermidine in the wt-p53 line were markedly increased compared with controls. However, the levels of acetylated spermidine increased only minimally in the p53-null line despite a marked decrease in spermidine in the treated cells. The cellular polyamine levels in cells treated with DFMO showed a reduction of putrescine and spermidine, which confirmed the effect of DFMO as a biosynthetic inhibitor (Fig. 4). Combination of 5-FU and DFMO also markedly reduced putrescine by half but did not lead to an increase in acetylated polyamines. Induction of SSAT Gene Expression by 5-FU and DENSPM— To test whether the 5-FU and DENSPM combination had a stronger effect on SSAT expression than each individual agent, a real-time PCR analysis was performed to quantify SSAT transcript levels in the tumor cells. As shown in Fig. 5, 5-FU alone led to only a minor increase in SSAT expression, but DENSPM produced a major increase. The combination of the two drugs, however, resulted in a marked induction of SSAT expression (24 times higher in wt-p53 cells and 10 times higher in p53-null cells). The extent of SSAT mRNA induction appeared to match the levels of acetylated spermidine in wt-p53 cells but not in p53-null cells. Although we did not measure SSAT enzyme activity levels, increased expression of the gene and the marked reduction of spermidine and spermine levels (see above) indicated that an increase in SSAT enzymatic activity occurred. H2O2 Production and Antioxidant Protective Effect—Because SSAT catabolizes polyamines to produce acetylated polyamines, which serve as substrates for polyamine oxidase that generates hydrogen peroxide (24Ha H.C. Woster P.M. Yager J.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11557-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), we investigated whether combined 5-FU and DENSPM treatment resulted in an increased level of H2O2 that would play a role in apoptotic responses as a toxic reactive oxygen species. Measurements of H2O2 using CM-H2DCFDA showed that incubation of cells with simultaneous 5-FU and DENSPM led to increased H2O2 production (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, 5-FU alone also caused a marked accumulation of H2O2, especially in p53-null cells. To determine whether the observed apoptosis involved reactive oxygen species, the cells were incubated with 5-FU and DENSPM in the presence of the antioxidant GSH, and attenuated cytotoxicity was observed, as expected (Fig. 6B). Transcriptome Analysis—From the MTS assay, the combination of 5-FU and DENSPM showed synergistic growth inhibition and cell-killing effects. The gene expression profiles of drug-treated cells at 48 h were investigated to elucidate the molecular pathways of the synergism. Both the wt-p53 and p53-null cell lines showed that a larger number of genes were significantly altered after combination treatment with 5-FU and DENSPM as compared with the single-agent treatment groups (Tables I and II). In the wt-p53 cell line, the numbers of differentially expressed genes among 2,016 cancer pathway-related genes examined in cells treated with 5-FU alone, DENSPM alone, or their combination were 61, 30, and 76, respectively. In the p53-null cell line, 41, 54, and 132 genes were altered. Consistent with the real-time PCR results, marked induction of SSAT mRNA was observed with combined 5-FU and DENSPM treatment in both cell lines (data not shown).Table IAltered expression of redox genes encoded by nuclear and mitochondria DNAGene descriptionAccession numberSourceHCT116 wt-p53HCT116 p53-null5-FUDENSPM5-FU + DENSPM5-FUDENSPM5-FU + DENSPMMTCO1NM_173704MT1.481.250.780.900.750.27MTCO2NM_173705MT1.560.890.661.160.580.14MTATP6NM_173702MT1.490.810.660.950.640.23MTATP8NM_173703MT1.490.760.640.890.540.21MTND3NM_173710MT0.870.620.620.680.290.19MTND4NM_173711MT1.440.820.630.630.470.15MTND6NM_173714MT0.750.460.650.550.760.54MTND4LNM_173712MT1.340.740.630.620.360.14WEE1XM_049184Nuclear0.490.680.310.680.840.90SDHBNM_003000Nuclear1.070.751.521.071.241.62UQCRHNM_006004Nuclear0.951.161.151.151.331.67COX8NM_004074Nuclear1.251.291.571.121.121.69SFNNM_006142Nuclear1.661.893.031.170.851.20FDXRXM_056248Nuclear2.002.602.361.181.061.20DUTU31930Nuclear0.890.760.500.941.481.38 Open table in a new tab Table IIAltered expression of DNA genes and p53 regulated genesGene descriptionAccession numberHCT116 wt-p53HCT116 p53-null5-FUDENSPM5-FU + DENSPM5-FUDENSPM5-FU + DENSPMDNA replication and chromosome cycle TREX1NM_0336280.660.440.500.730.470.41 TOP2AJ040880.740.910.350.791.061.13 TOP3U434311.090.480.520.901.120.73 MSH2U039110.730.620.380.750.840.65 WEE1XM_0491840.490.680.310.680.840.90p53 regulated genes MDM2M924241.250.994.630.681.010.75 CDKN1AL256103.500.925.703.241.981.25 BBC3NM_0144172.117.842.281.801.661.53 FDXRXM_0562482.002.612.361.181.061.20 MIC-1AF0197701.993.973.950.710.710.50 DDIT1L244981.330.912.530.631.051.26 SFNNM_0061421.661.893.031.170.851.20 Open table in a new tab In the wt-p53 HCT116 cell line, the expression of p53 downstream genes (p21WAF1, mdm2, bbc3, mic-1, ferredoxin reductase, 14-3-3-σ, etc.) was induced, demonstrating that the p53 pathway was activated. These genes were not induced in the p53-null cells. Consistent with the flow cytometry results, the expression of cell cycle arrest genes (p21WAF1, cyclin D2, cyclin A, 14-3-3-σ) were also altered. Genes involved in mitochondrial functions were statistically significantly down-regulated (Table I, p = 0.04). In the p53-null HCT116 cell line, genes in the categories of oxidative phosphorylation (p = 0.0007) and electron transport chain (p = 0.0001) were altered. Most of the genes in respiratory chain complex I were suppressed (Table I). Some of the gene expression results were also confirmed at the protein level by Western blot analysis (see Fig. 8). Loss of Mitochondria Potential and Cytochrome c Release— To test the hypothesis that mitochondria are the potential target for the drug treatment, we measured the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) using Rho123. Combined 5-FU and DENSPM treatment resulted in a significant decrease in Δψm, as shown by a shift in the cell population from high to low fluorescence (Fig. 7). Consistent with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm after the combination drug treatment in both cell lines (Fig. 8). Caspase 9 Dependence of 5-FU/DENSPM-induced Cell Death—On Western blot using antibodies that specifically recognize activated caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9, caspase 3 was not activated in 5-FU and DENSPM-treated cells, but activated caspase 9 was detected (Fig. 8). Protein extracts from HL-60 cells with and without Ara-C treatment were used as positive and negative controls for the cleaved and activated forms of caspase 3. This result showed that 5-FU/DENSPM-induced cell death is caspase 9-dependent and caspase 3-independent, which is one of the four types of apoptosis involving different combinations of caspase dependence (33Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. de la Elia A. Pompa J.L. Kagi D. Khoo W. Potter J. Yoshida R. Kaufman S.A. Lowe S.W. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Western blotting analyses also showed that cyclin A and cyclin B1 were decreased after the combination treatment, confirming our microarray results. Consistent with our previous report (10Zhang W. Ramdas L. Shen W. Song S.W. Hu L. Hamilton S.R. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that Fas expression was increased in cells treated with 5-FU, 5-FU as well as combined 5-FU and DENSPM also caused Fas up-regulation. Consistent with the results from our transcriptome analysis, 5-FU and DENSPM activated p53 and protein expression of genes of p53 downstream (phosphorylated p53, serine 15, p21Waf1, and mdm2) in the HCT116 wt-p53 cell line but not in the p53-null cells (Fig. 8). We reported previously that high-dose 5-FU modulates the polyamine pathway in colon carcinoma cells (10Zhang W. Ramdas L. Shen W. Song S.W. Hu L. Hamilton S.R. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This observation led us to speculate that 5-FU in combination with polyamine-targeting drugs may have synergistic effects in cytotoxicity. This present study showed that indeed the combination of 5-FU with the polyamine catabolism-enhancing drug DENSPM synergistically killed colon carcinoma cells independent of their p53 status. Interestingly, antagonistic effects depending on the drug treatment sequence were observed in p53 wild-type and null lines. Most notably, DENSPM pretreatment followed by 5-FU produced a antagonistic effect in both cell lines. This finding indicates that the synergistic effect of simultaneous 5-FU and DENSPM is not because of “priming” of one drug for the other. Rather, the effects of the two drugs may need to augment each other, although we do not know the exact mechanism involved. One possibility is that both 5-FU and DENSPM damage DNA but through different mechanisms (34Basu H.S. Schwietert H.C. Feuerstein B.G. Marton L.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 35Edwards M.L. Snyder R.D. Stemerick D.M. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 2414-2420Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which may make DNA repair less effective. In contrast to 5-FU and DENSPM, combination of 5-FU with the polyamine synthesis inhibitor DFMO did not have synergistic cell killing effects. Furthermore, 5-FU followed by DFMO in the wt-p53 line and DFMO pretreatment followed by 5-FU in the p53-null line had marked antagonistic effects. Although we do not yet understand the mechanisms that account for these different effects, the results underscore the impact of the genetic background of tumor cells on the cellular response to drug treatment and therefore the importance of understanding these relationships. Modulation of polyamine levels and their cellular responses is a complex process. The synergistic effect of combined DENSPM and 5-FU must be specific at molecular levels. One of the molecular effectors appears to be that SSAT is synergistically induced by the combination of 5-FU and DENSPM but not by 5-FU and DFMO. Previous studies have shown that DENSPM-induced SSAT expression, which is responsible for the depletion of spermine and spermidine via acetylation (36Fogel-Petrovic M. Kramer D.L. Vujcic S. Miller J. McManis J.S. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, cellular polyamine levels were markedly reduced by the combination of 5-FU and DENSPM. Acetylated spermidine accumulated in wt-p53 cells but not in p53-null cells. Surprisingly, the levels of putrescine were increased by combined 5-FU and DENSPM in wt-p53 cells but decreased in p53-null cells, indicating that the p53 status has an impact on how polyamines are depleted. p53 could be suppressing the diamine exporter, resulting in enhanced retention of polyamine catabolic products in wt-p53 cells (37Xie X. Gillies R.J. Gerner E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20484-20489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Increased putrescine in the absence of spermidine may have another cellular effect because increased putrescine was shown to inhibit hypusine formation and transfer of the butylamine moiety of spermidine to a lysine residue in eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A), resulting in induction of apoptosis (28Tome M.E. Fiser S.M. Payne C.M. Gerner E.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This mechanism may involve the ability of deoxyhypusine synthetase to produce homospermidine, as recently shown by Park et al. (38Park J.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32683-32691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the polyamine catabolic pathway, acetylated spermine or spermidine is oxidized by polyamine oxidase. This reaction produces hydrogen peroxide, which at high levels damages mitochondrial membranes resulting in cytochrome c release. Release of cytochrome c activates members of caspase families and triggers the cascade to apoptosis (25Chen Y. Kramer D.L. Diegelman P. Vujcic S. Porter C.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6437-6444PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-mitochondrial effects of acetylated polyamines were reported in previous studies (39Snyder R.D. Beach D.C. Loudy D.E. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 347-356PubMed Google Scholar, 40Marverti G. Piccinini G. Ghiaroni S. Barbieri D. Quaglino D. Moruzzi M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that acetylated polyamines cause the loss of mitochondrial DNA (40Marverti G. Piccinini G. Ghiaroni S. Barbieri D. Quaglino D. Moruzzi M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Results from our study showed that the combination of 5-FU with DENSPM indeed elevated cellular hydrogen peroxide and damaged mitochondrial membranes. Consistent with mitochondria being an important target for combined 5-FU and DENSPM, our transcriptome analyses showed that, regardless of the p53 status, genes involved in mitochondrial functions were preferentially affected. However, mitochondrial alterations are more apparent in p53-null cells where 11 of 136 altered genes are involved in mitochondrial function. Among the 13 genes essential for electron transport chain subunits in the inner mitochondrial membrane (41Chinnery P.F. Howell N. Andrews R.M. Turnbull D.M. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 36: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), 8 genes were suppressed in the p53-null line. Among the mitochondrial function-related genes that were markedly attenuated in p53-null cells were cytochrome c oxidase I and II (MTCO1 and MTCO2), which are subunits of cytochrome c oxidase. MTCO2 transfers an electron from cytochrome c to the binuclear center of cytochrome a3-CuB (42Hill B.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and translocates protons, which are associated with the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (43Babcock G.T. Wikstrom M. Nature. 1992; 356: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). NADH dehydrogenase resides in the first complex in the electron transfer chain and catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q (44Gerhard M. Biochemical Pathways: An Atlas of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Thus, suppression of MTCO1, MTCO2, and NADH dehydrogenases by the combined drug treatment would likely lead to decreased efficiency of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and subsequently increase the production of superoxides. In wt-p53 cells, in addition to mitochondria-related genes, many genes involved in the p53 pathway were affected, indicating that the p53-mediated apoptosis pathway most likely played a dominating role in the observed cell death, as expected. One other interesting gene was dUTPase, which hydrolyzes dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate. Remarkably, increased dUTPase levels in colon cancer cell lines have a major role in their resistance to 5-FU and fluorodeoxyuridine (45Canman C.E. Radany E.H. Parsels L.A. Davis M.A. Lawrence T.S. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2296-2298PubMed Google Scholar, 46Pugacheva E.N. Ivanov A.V. Kravchenko J.E. Kopnin B.P. Levine A.J. Chumakov P.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4595-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the expression of dUTPase was suppressed when 5-FU and DENSPM were applied simultaneously in the wt-p53 cell line. This reduction may represent another mechanism that is responsible for the synergistic effects of combined 5-FU and DENSPM in the wt-p53 cell line. Thus, the presence of wt-p53 appears to sensitize cells to 5-FU and DENSPM through multiple processes. In summary, our study shows that the combination of 5-FU and DENSPM provides more effective cytotoxicity in colon cancer in a cell culture system through effects on the polyamine pathway. The potential of 5-FU and DENSPM as a therapeutic combination for treating colon cancer patients awaits results from preclinical animal model experiments and future clinical trials.

Because SHP-2 does not bind directly to β3, we attempted to identify a linker protein that could mediate SHP-2/β3 association.

Expression of a DOK1 mutant that does not bind to β3 also disrupts SHP-2/β3 association. As a result of SHP-2/β3 disruption, IGF-I dependent phosphorylation of Akt and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and its ability to stimulate cell migration and proliferation were significantly impaired.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9988) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a potent stimulant of SMC migration and proliferation responses (2Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2482-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that ligand occupancy of the αVβ3 integrin is required for SMC to respond appropriately to IGF-I (3Zheng B. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Blocking the ligand occupancy of αVβ3 inhibits IGF-I-dependent downstream signaling including phosphorylation of IRS-1 (3Zheng B. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the trans-membrane, scaffolding protein Src homology 2 domain containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase substrate-1 (SHPS-1), as well as cell migration and proliferation (4Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4259-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One important event that occurs in response to ligand occupancy of αVβ3 is the phosphorylation of the β3 subunit, and previous studies have shown that this is required for IGF-I-dependent signaling and biologic actions (5Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). SMCs expressing a mutant form of β3 in which the two tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of β3 were substituted with phenylalanines did not respond to IGF-I with an increase in DNA synthesis (5Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore in SMC phosphorylation of the β3 subunit of αVβ3 integrin plays a key role in regulating IGF-I dependent cellular responses. Our prior studies have shown that ligand occupancy of αVβ3 regulates IGF-IR signaling by regulating the transfer of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (4Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4259-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In high density cultures, the β3 subunit is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and Src homology 2 domain tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2) can be co-immunoprecipitated with phosphorylated β3 (5Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This association correlates with membrane localization of SHP-2 and is required for the subsequent transfer of SHP-2 to its membrane substrate protein SHPS-1 following IGF-I stimulation (5Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The disruption of SHP-2 and β3 association results in the elimination of SHP-2 transfer to SHPS-1 (5Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As a result, IGF-I-dependent cell migration and DNA synthesis are both decreased (5Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Maile L.A. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1417-1425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the association of SHP-2 and the β3 subunit is a prerequisite for proper SHP-2 transfer and that this is required for IGF-I-stimulated biologic actions. We have previously shown that the addition of IGF-I to subconfluent cultures induces an increase in β3 phosphorylation and a corresponding increase of SHP-2 association (5Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The incubation of SMC cultures with a Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2 inhibits β3 phosphorylation and blocks SHP-2 association with β3 (5Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting a phosphorylation-dependent association between SHP-2 and the β3 subunit. The β3 cytoplasmic domain contains one NPXY motif. This motif has been shown to interact with proteins containing phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains (7Songyang Z. Margolis B. Chaudhuri M. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14863-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). SHP-2 does not contain a PTB domain, but it has two SH2 domains, which have been shown to mediate binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues that are followed by a specific motif YXXL/I (8Case R.D. Piccione E. Wolf G. Benett A.M. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10467-10474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it is likely that a linker protein containing both PTB domain and YXXL/I motif(s) modulates SHP-2 binding to β3. The adaptor proteins insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS-1, IRS-2) contain both motifs, and IRS-1 has been shown to bind SHP-2 upon insulin receptor activation (9Myers Jr., M.G. Mendez R. Shi P. Pierce J.H. Rhoads R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26908-26914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, IRS-1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with β3 in response to insulin in rat fibroblasts that overexpress insulin receptors (10Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, although both IRS-1 and IRS-2 are expressed in primary SMC cultures, we could not detect co-immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 or IRS-2 with β3, excluding them as linker proteins for SHP-2 and β3 association. DOK1 is a member of the IRS family of proteins that contains a PH domain followed by a PTB domain in its N terminus. It has multiple tyrosine residues in its C-terminal sequence that undergo phosphorylation upon tyrosine kinase activation (11Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 12Sanchez-Margalet V. Zoratti R. Sung C.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DOK1 has been shown to function as a scaffolding protein that recruits key signaling molecules such as, the Ras-GTP-activating protein (Ras-GAP) and the adaptor protein Nck (13Ellis C. Liu X.Q. Anderson D. Abraham N. Veillette A. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 895-901PubMed Google Scholar, 14Murakami H. Yamamura Y. Shimono Y. Kawai K. Kurokawa K. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32781-32790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) following its tyrosine phosphorylation. These associations have suggested that DOK1 plays a role in regulating cell functions such as migration, proliferation, and transformation (14Murakami H. Yamamura Y. Shimono Y. Kawai K. Kurokawa K. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32781-32790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Songyang Z. Yamanashi Y. Liu D. Baltimore D. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2287-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is not known whether SHP-2 binds DOK1; however, tyrosines 203 and 337 of DOK1 reside in YXXL motifs and therefore have the potential to bind to the SH2 domains of SHP-2. The PTB domain of DOK1 has been shown to be necessary for its regulatory role in cell transformation (15Songyang Z. Yamanashi Y. Liu D. Baltimore D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2459-2465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, DOK1 has been shown to bind to the NPXY motif of β3 via its PTB domain (17Calderwood D.A. Fujioka Y. de Pereda J.M. Garcia-Alvarez B. Nakamoto T. Margolis B. McGlade C.J. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2272-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of the DOK1-β3 interaction has yet to be determined. Because of these properties DOK-1 seemed a likely candidate for mediating phosphotyrosine-dependent binding of SHP-2 to β3. In the current studies, we determined whether DOK1 mediated the association of SHP-2 with β3 and analyzed the functional consequences of disrupting this association on SHP-2 transfer to downstream signaling molecules. In addition, we further determined whether disruption of this interaction was associated with a change in IGF-IR-linked signaling and biologic actions. Human IGF-I was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Immobilon-P membranes were purchased from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). DMEM containing 4500 mg of glucose/liter (DMEM-H) was purchased from Invitrogen. Streptomycin and penicillin were purchased from Invitrogen. A polyclonal antibody for the β3-subunit of porcine αVβ3 integrin was generated using two synthetic peptides containing the amino acid sequences encompassing positions 36–63 and 623–648. Polyclonal antibodies for SHPS-1, SHP-2, and the hemagglutinin epitope (HA) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) and anti-DOK1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against phospho-p44/p42MAPK, p44/p42MAPK, phospho-Akt, and Akt were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A synthetic peptide was prepared that contained the TAT sequence that confers cell permeability (18Ho A. Schwarze S.R. Mermelstein S.J. Waksman G. Dowdy S.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 474-477PubMed Google Scholar) followed by 11 residues of the DOK1 sequence (underlined) YARAAARQARA201WPYTLLRRYGRD211. This DOK-1 sequence contains the known site that mediates binding to β3 (17Calderwood D.A. Fujioka Y. de Pereda J.M. Garcia-Alvarez B. Nakamoto T. Margolis B. McGlade C.J. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2272-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). A second peptide that contained the TAT sequence followed by a SH2 domain recognition sequence within DOK-1 was also prepared, YARAAARQARA334KPLYWDLYE342. These two peptides are referred to hereafter as DOK1-β3 and DOK1-SHP-2 blocking peptides, respectively. The peptides were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Purity and sequence confirmation were determined by mass spectrometry. Cell Culture—pSMCs were prepared from porcine aortas as described previously (19Parker A. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2470-2476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in DMEM-H with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) streptomycin (100 ng/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). The smooth muscle cells that were used in these experiments were used between passages 4–16. Generation of pLenti Expression Vectors—The full-length human DOK1 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from mRNA that had been derived from human fibroblasts (GM10 Coriell Inst., Camden, NJ). The full-length DOK1 sequence was PCR-amplified and cloned into pcDNA-3.1 vector to generate pcDNA-DOK1 wild type (WT). The forward and reverse primers that were used to generate the PCR product were 5′-CACCATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTGACGGAGCAGTGATGGAAGGGCCGCT-3′ and 5′-TCAGGTAGATCCCTCTGACTTGACCCCA-3′. The wild type DOK1 construct contains a hemagglutinin sequence at the 5′-end of the coding sequence (underlined). Arg207 and Arg208 were mutated to alanines to generate what is referred to hereafter as the DOK1-AA mutant. The mutant construct was generated by first synthesizing two DNA fragments that contained the mutations using pcDNA-DOK1WT as a template. The primers used to generate the first fragment were the forward primer from above plus 5′-CCTTGTCCCGGCCATAGGCAGCCAACAGAGTGTAGGGCC-5′. The primers used to generate the second fragment were 5′-GGCCCTACACTCTGTTGGCTGCCTATGGCCGGGACAAGG-3′ plus the reverse primer from above. The two fragments were designed to overlap across the region of the mutation (bold letters). They were annealed and subsequently extended by Taq polymerase (Clontech) to generate a full-length DOK1 sequence containing the alanine substitutions. The final PCR products containing a Kozac sequence (CACC) followed by a sequence encoding the HA epitope at the 5′-end of the DOK1 coding sequence were cloned into the pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen). The complete sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. Generation of Virus Stocks—293FT cells (Invitrogen) were prepared for generation of virus stocks of each individual pLenti construct. Cells were plated at 5 × 106/75 cm2 flask (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) the day before transfection in the growth medium (DMEM-H with 10% FBS with streptomycin at 100 ng/ml and penicillin at 100 units/ml). On the day of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with 5 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) without antibiotics or serum. DNA-Lipofectamine™ 2000 complexes for each transfection sample were prepared and added along with total 8 ml of Opti-MEM I medium according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The next day the medium containing the DNA-Lipofectamine™ 2000 complexes was removed and replaced with 12 ml of growth medium. The virus-containing supernatants were harvested at 48-h post-transfection, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter, and stored as 1-ml aliquots at –80 °C. Establishment of SMCs Expressing pLenti Constructs—pSMCs (passage 4–5) were seeded at 3 × 105/well in 6-well plates (Falcon, catalog number 353046) the day before transduction. The viral stocks were thawed, and the viral complexes precipitated as follows. For each 1 ml of virus stock, 1 μl of an 80 mg/ml solution of chondroitin sulfate (Sigma, C4384) was added, then mixed gently, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. 1 μl of 80 mg/ml Polybrene (Sigma, H9286) was subsequently added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the virus, and the supernatant was removed. For transduction, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of growth medium and 1 μl of Polybrene (40 mg/ml) was added, and then the mixture was incubated with the cells for 24 h. The virus-containing medium was removed and changed to 2 ml of growth medium for another 24 h, then replaced with selection medium (growth medium containing 4 μg/ml blasticidin, Invitrogen). The cultures were grown until they reached confluent density. The expression of the HA-tagged DOK1 proteins was detected by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (1: 1000) followed by an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/10-cm plate (BD Biosciences) and grown for 7 days to reach confluency. Subconfluent cultures were used 3 days after plating. The cultures were incubated in serum-free DMEM-H for 12–16 h prior to the addition of IGF-I (100 ng/ml). For the experiments in which the cell-permeable peptides were added, 10 μg/ml of each peptide was added directly to the serum-free media for 1 h prior to adding IGF-I. The cell monolayers were lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm sodium fluoride and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was exposed to a 1:330 dilution of anti-DOK1, anti-β3, or anti-SHPS-1 antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were immobilized using protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C and washed three times with the same buffer. The precipitated proteins were eluted in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated with a 7.5 or 8% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes that were blocked for 1 h in 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-saline buffer with 0.2% Tween 20. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies (1:500 for Tyr(P) and SHP-2 or 1:1000 for antibodies against β3-subunit or DOK1). To detect the phosphorylation of Akt and p44/p42MAPK, 30 μl of cell lysate was removed prior to immunoprecipitation and mixed with 25 μlof2× Laemmli sample buffer then separated by SDS-PAGE using an 8% gel. Anti-phospho-p44/p42MAPK (1:1000) and anti-phospho-Akt (1:1000) were used to detect activated MAPK and Akt. Total p44/p42MAPK and Akt protein were detected using a monoclonal anti-Erk antibody (1:1000) or anti-Akt (1:1000). The proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce Chemical Co.), and their abundance was analyzed using the GeneGnome CCD image system (Syngene, Ltd., Cambridge, UK). The images obtained were also scanned using an Agfa Scanner. Densitometric analyses of the images were undertaken using NIH Image, version 1.61. All experiments were conducted at least three times. Cell Migration Assay—pSMCs were seeded in 6-well dishes and grown to confluency. A razor blade was used to scrape an area of cells, leaving a denuded area and a sharp visible wound line. The wounded monolayers were then incubated with 0.2% fetal bovine serum-DMEM-H in the presence or absence of the DOK1-β3, DOK1-SHP2 peptide (10 μg/ml) with or without 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 48 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed and stained (Diff Quick, Dade Behring, Newark, DE), and the number of cells migrating into the wound area was counted. Eight of the previously selected 1-mm areas at the edge of the wound were counted for each data point. Each experiment was repeated three times and the results are the means ± S.E. of eight determinations in each of the three separate experiments. Cell Proliferation Assay—Assessment of SMC proliferation was performed as described previously (20Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of the DOK1-β3, DOK1-SHP2 peptide (10 μg/ml) with or without IGF-I (50 ng/ml) for 48 h, and the cell number in each well was counted. Each treatment was analyzed in triplicate, and the results represent mean values of six independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to compare the differences between control and treatment groups or control cells and cells expressing mutant proteins. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. DOK1 Is Associated with Phosphorylated β3 Subunit in pSMCs—Consistent with our previous finding (5Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 subunit was detected at high level in the basal state in confluent cultures, and IGF-I stimulation decreased the level of phosphorylated β3 (89.8 ± 5% reduction, mean ± S.E., n = 3, p < 0.01). In contrast, in subconfluent cultures, there was a low level of β3 phosphorylation basally, and IGF-I stimulated an increase in β3 phosphorylation (4.22 ± 0.13-fold increase compared with basal level, mean ± S.E., n = 3, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1). When DOK1 and β3 association was evaluated, the amount of β3 that associated with DOK1 correlated with levels of β3 phosphorylation. IGF-I decreased the amount of DOK1 associated with β3to14 ± 5% of the basal level in high density cultures and stimulated a 3.00 ± 1.06-fold increase in subconfluent cultures (mean ± S.E., n = 3, p < 0.01 in both cases). These results suggested the association between DOK1 and the β3 subunit was phosphorylation-dependent, and they are consistent with previous studies showing a direct association between DOK1 and the β3 subunit (17Calderwood D.A. Fujioka Y. de Pereda J.M. Garcia-Alvarez B. Nakamoto T. Margolis B. McGlade C.J. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2272-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In contrast, we could not detect an association between β3 and IRS-1 or IRS-2 or between β3 and Grb-2-associated binder 2 (Gab2). Inhibition of DOK1-β3 Association Blocks SHP-2 Association with the β3 Subunit—To test the hypothesis that DOK1 may mediate SHP-2 association with the β3 subunit, we incubated subconfluent SMCs with a synthetic peptide that contained the region of sequence that had been shown to mediate DOK1-β3 association prior to IGF-I stimulation (17Calderwood D.A. Fujioka Y. de Pereda J.M. Garcia-Alvarez B. Nakamoto T. Margolis B. McGlade C.J. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2272-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). It would be predicted that because this peptide is added in excess, it would bind phosphorylated β3 and prevent the binding of DOK1 to β3. In control cultures, IGF-I induced DOK1 binding to β3 after 5 min (Fig. 2A, first panel) and at the same time point, there was a corresponding increase of SHP-2 association with β3 (Fig. 2A, third panel). Exposure to the peptide abolished the IGF-I-induced increase in DOK1 binding to β3, and it markedly inhibited SHP-2 association with β3. However, there was no significant impairment of IGF-I-induced β3 phosphorylation. Quantitative analysis of the tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 showed that IGF-I induced a 4.36 ± 0.84-fold increase in control cultures and a 4.08 ± 1.59-fold increase in β3 phosphorylation in the presence of the blocking peptide (mean ± S.E., n = 3, p = 0.86). These results suggested that DOK1 might be mediating SHP-2 association with β3. To confirm this hypothesis, we generated SMCs expressing a DOK1 mutant that had had arginines 207 and 208 substituted with alanines (DOK1-AA). The expression of a mutant containing these substitutions blocked phosphotyrosine-mediated binding of DOK1 and altered the function of DOK1 in NIH-3T3 cells (15Songyang Z. Yamanashi Y. Liu D. Baltimore D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2459-2465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that DOK1WT and DOK1-AA were expressed in SMCs at similar levels. In cells expressing wild type DOK1, IGF-I increased the binding of DOK1 to β3, and this was associated with a corresponding increase in the association of SHP-2 with β3. However, in cells expressing the DOK1-AA mutant, the ability of IGF-I to stimulate an increase in DOK1 binding to β3 was abolished, and the association between β3 and SHP-2 was decreased (Fig. 2C). These results provided in vivo evidence that DOK1 binds to β3 via its PTB domain and this binding mediates the recruitment of SHP-2 to the β3 subunit. Disruption of DOK1 and SHP-2 Association Inhibits SHP-2 Binding to β3—Because we showed that DOK1 is required for SHP-2 binding to β3 and DOK1 contains the YXXL motifs that are potential binding sites for SHP-2, we hypothesized that DOK1 would bind to SHP-2 through this domain and that this interaction was required for SHP-2 binding to β3. Therefore we determined whether 1) DOK1 bound SHP-2 through its YXXL motifs and 2) whether disrupting the binding altered the interaction between β3 and SHP-2. Fig. 3A illustrates the regions of DOK1 that contain the PH domain at the N terminus followed by the PTB domain. Multiple tyrosine residues, including Tyr203 and Tyr337, that are located within YXXL motifs are also shown. In the basal state, there is low level of SHP-2 association with DOK1, and the level is significantly enhanced after IGF-I stimulation for 5 min (2.73 ± 0.28-fold increase compared with basal state, p < 0.05, Fig. 3, B and C). Pretreatment of cultures with the synthetic peptide that contains a DOK-1 SH2 recognition sequence (i.e. Y337WDL) abolished the association between SHP-2 and DOK1 (Fig. 3D, first panel). In contrast to the disrupting peptide used in Fig. 2A this peptide did not block DOK1 and β3 subunit association (Fig. 3D, second panel). β3 and SHP-2 association was also inhibited following peptide exposure (Fig. 3D, fourth panel). These results further support the conclusion that SHP-2 binding to β3 is mediated by DOK1. Inhibiting SHP-2-β3 Association Impairs SHP-2 Recruitment to SHPS-1—Our previous studies have shown that inhibiting of SHP-2 and β3 association by inhibiting β3 phosphorylation leads to impaired SHP-2 transfer to SHPS-1 upon IGF-I stimulation (5Ling Y. Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1824-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore we analyzed SHP-2 recruitment to SHPS-1 in the presence of either the DOK1-β3 or the DOK1-SHP2 blocking peptide. In control cultures, IGF-I induced SHP-2 association with SHPS-1 after 5 min. However, this association was abolished following exposure to either the DOK1-β3 or the DOK1-SHP-2 blocking peptide (Fig. 4, A and B). Compared with SMCs expressing DOK1-WT, in which IGF-I induces a significant increase in SHP-2 binding to SHPS-1, expression of the DOK1-AA mutant also inhibited the increase in the amount of SHP-2 that is transferred to SHPS-1 after IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 4, C and D). These results suggested that the degree of DOK1-AA expression is sufficient to exert a dominant negative effect on SHP-2 transfer to SHPS-1 following IGF-I stimulation. IGF-I-mediated Phosphorylation of Akt and p44/p42MAPK Is Decreased in the Presence of DOK1-β3 and DOK1-SHP2 Blocking Peptide or in Cells Expressing the DOK1-AA Mutant— Impaired recruitment of SHP-2 to SHPS-1 or expression of a SHP-2 mutant with attenuated phosphatase activity have been linked to deficient MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation in response to growth factor stimulation including insulin and IGF-I (21Ivins Zito C.

We therefore analyzed IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of Akt and p44/p42MAPK in control cultures and in SMCs that had been exposed to either the DOK1-β3 blocking peptide or the DOK1-SHP2 blocking peptide prior to IGF-I addition. Fig. 5 shows that IGF-I induced a significant increase of phosphorylation of Akt and p44/p42MAPK after 5 and 10 min in control cultures. In the presence of the DOK1-β3 blocking peptide, however, the IGF-I-induced respo"

PLD activation is a rapid and transient process, but a negative regulator has not been found that inhibits signal-dependent PLD activation. Here, for the first time, we report that tubulin binding to PLD2 is an inhibition mechanism for muscarinic receptor-linked PLD2 activation. Tubulin was identified in an immunoprecipitated PLD2 complex from COS-7 cells by peptide mass fingerprinting. The direct interaction between PLD2 and tubulin was found to be mediated by a specific region of PLD2 (amino acids 476-612). PLD2 was potently inhibited (IC50 <10 nm) by tubulin binding in vitro. In cells, the interaction between PLD2 and tubulin was increased by the microtubule disrupting agent nocodazole and reduced by the microtubule stabilizing agent Taxol. Moreover, PLD2 activity was found to be inversely correlated with the level of monomeric tubulin. In addition, we found that interaction with and the inhibition of PLD2 by monomeric tubulin is important for the muscarinic receptor-linked PLD signaling pathway. Interaction between PLD2 and tubulin was increased only after 1-2 min of carbachol stimulation when carbachol-stimulated PLD2 activity was decreased. The expression of the tubulin binding region of PLD2 blocked the later decrease in carbachol-induced PLD activity by masking tubulin binding. Taken together, these results indicate that an increase in local membrane monomeric tubulin concentration inhibits PLD2 activity, and provides a novel mechanism for the inhibition of muscarinic receptor-induced PLD2 activation by interaction with tubulin.

Many reports have been issued about the mechanisms of receptor-mediated PLD activation. Although the mammalian PLD isozymes, PLD1 and PLD2, have some different regulatory properties, in general, agonist-induced PLD is activated by various protein kinases, including protein kinase C, protein-tyrosine kinase, and the MAP kinase family, in addition to small G proteins of the ARF, Rho, and Ras families (8Hammond S.M.

Clonal cell lines were usually maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline, 10% (v/v) equine serum, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. For transfection and transient expression of PLD2, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 100-mm dishes and transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), as described previously (39Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5462-5470PubMed Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of PLD2-binding Proteins—Cultured cells were harvested and lysed with PLD assay buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.3, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm CaCl2. 3 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% cholic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. After a brief sonication, the lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the cell extracts were incubated, respectively, with immobilized anti-PLD antibody overnight. The precipitates were washed four times and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. For silver staining, PLD and binding proteins were eluted from the immune complexes with antigen peptide of PLD antibody, as previously reported (10Lee T.G. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Hong S. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Yi K.S. Bae S. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Suh P-G. Ryu S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1347: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein Identification by Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—The technique used was as described previously (26Caulfield M.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 58: 319-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). In brief, the fraction containing the 55-kDa protein (p55) after co-immunoprecipitation from COS-7 cells was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the band corresponding to p55 was excised and digested with trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 6 h at 37 °C. Masses tryptic peptides were measured using a Bruker Reflex III mass spectrometer, as described previously (17Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Ha S.H. Yoo J.S. Du G. Frohman M.A. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21295-21301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Delayed ion extraction resulted in peptide masses with better than 50 parts/million mass accuracy on average. Using the amino acid sequences and the mass numbers of the tryptic peptides of p55, the Swiss-Prot data base was searched for a match. Purification of Recombinant PLD2 from Baculovirus-transfected Sf9 Cells—His6-tagged human PLD2 was purified from detergent extracts of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells by chelating-Sepharose affinity column chromatography, as described previously (40Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Construction and Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins—The fulllength cDNA of human PLD2 was digested into fragments containing specific domains. These individual PLD2 fragments were then ligated into the EcoRI or SmaI sites of the pGEX4T3 vector. Subcloning and polymerase chain reaction were used to produce expression vectors encoding the respective GST fusion proteins (19Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Shin K.J. Lee J.S. Ha S.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28252-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transformed with the individual expression vectors encoding the GST fusion proteins, and after harvesting the cells the expressed GST fusion proteins were purified by standard methods using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. In Vitro Binding Analysis—In vitro binding was performed in 300 μl of PLD assay buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% cholic acid for 20 min at 37 °C. After a brief centrifugation, the precipitated complexes were washed five times in the same buffer before being loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel. In Vitro PLD Activity Assay—PIP2-dependent PLD activity was assayed by measuring choline release from phosphatidylcholine, as described previously (41Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In brief, the reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min in a 125-μl assay mixture containing PLD assay buffer, the PLD preparation, and 25 μl of phospholipid vesicles composed of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, PIP2, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, and dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-[methyl-3H]choline (a total of 150,000 cpm/assay) at a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1. Oleate-dependent PLD activity was assayed as described previously (40Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In brief, phosphatidylcholine vesicles (25 μl) containing 5 nmol of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and 200,000 dpm of dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-[methyl-3H]choline were added to a reaction mixture (175 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.0, 2 mm EGTA, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 20 μm sodium oleate, and 0.1 m KCl. The final concentration of phosphatidylcholine in the reaction mixture was 25 μm. The assay mixture was then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was terminated by adding 0.3 ml of 1 n HCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (50:50:0.3). After a brief centrifugation, the amount of [methyl-3H]choline in 0.5 ml of the aqueous phase was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In Vivo PLD Activity Assay—In vivo PLD activity was determined, as described previously (39Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5462-5470PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, vector or human PLD2-transfected COS-7 cells were cultured for 48 h. The cells were then loaded with [3H]myristic acid (10 μCi/ml) for 4 h and washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The loaded cells were treated carbachol with 0.4% butanol, scraped into 0.8 ml of methanol and 1 m NaCl (1:1), and mixed with 0.4 ml of chloroform. The organic phases were dried, and the lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel plates. The PLD activity of PLD2 overexpressing PC12 cells was determined using the same procedures. The amount of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol formed was expressed as a percentage of total 3H-lipid to account for cell labeling efficiency differences. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C in a Laemmli sample buffer (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (19Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Shin K.J. Lee J.S. Ha S.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28252-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Monomeric Tubulin Extraction—Monomeric tubulin were extracted from vector and PLD2-transfected COS-7 cells plated on 100-mm dishes, as described previously (43Breitfeld P.P. McKinnon W.C. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Following treatments as indicated, cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped. The cells were then incubated with 0.2 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 containing microtubule stabilizing buffer (2 m glycerol, 0.1 m Pipes, pH 7.1, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min; the supernatants and the pellets contained monomeric and polymeric tubulin, respectively. Cell Fractionation—Cells were treated as above and washed with PBS. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and immediately sonicated. Each sample was centrifuged at 600 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet were collected and used as the membrane fraction. Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemical analysis was performed as described previously (44Kim Y. Han J.M. Han B.R. Lee K.A. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Jang I.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13621-13627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In brief, PLD2-transfected PC12 cells were grown on coverslips, rinsed with cold PBS four times, and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing with PBS and blocking with PBS containing 1% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml mouse β-tubulin monoclonal antibodies and rabbit PLD polyclonal antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing six times with PBS, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were incubated with the cells for 1 h to allow visualization of tubulin and PLD2. After a further six washings with PBS, the slides were examined under a confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany). 55-kDa Protein Precipitated with PLD2 from COS-7 Cell Was Identified as α,β-Tubulin—To find the binding partners of PLD2, we started our investigation by looking for cellular PLD2-binding proteins in transiently PLD2 overexpressing COS-7 cells. To find the specific binding partner of PLD2, after the precipitation with anti-PLD antibody, PLD2 were eluted with antigen peptide of PLD antibody, and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by silver staining. As a result, we found that the co-precipitate contained PLD2-binding proteins with relative molecular masses of 55,000 (p55) and some other binding proteins (Fig. 1A). To identify the PLD2-interacting protein, p55 was excised from the polyacrylamide gel, digested with trypsin, and the cleaved peptide mixture was then subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Fig. 1B shows the mass spectrum of the digested peptides of p55. The masses obtained were compared with proteins in the Swiss-Prot data base using the MS-Fit peptide mass search program. The peptides were found to have molecular masses that were almost identical to the calculated masses of the corresponding theoretically predicted tryptic peptides of α- and β-tubulin. This peptide search result was performed at an accuracy of 50 parts/million, and the analyzed peptides covered 24% of the α-tubulin, and 50% of the β-tubulin sequence. To substantiate the identity of these proteins further, the presence of tubulin in the PLD2 precipitate was confirmed using a monoclonal antibody specific to β-tubulin. As shown in Fig. 1C, p55 was blotted by β-tubulin monoclonal antibody. Based on these results, we concluded that the p55 interacting with PLD2 from COS-7 cells is a α,β-tubulin heterodimer (monomeric tubulin). Tubulin Directly Interacts with PLD2—To determine whether tubulin associates directly with PLD2, 99% pure monomeric tubulin was incubated with the PLD2. As shown in Fig. 2A, tubulin coprecipitated with PLD2 in a concentration-dependent manner, demonstrating that tubulin binds directly to PLD2. To identify the PLD2 sequence involved in tubulin binding, we constructed GST fusion proteins as shown in Fig. 2B, and tested them for their ability to bind to purified tubulin. GST-PLD2 (amino acids 476-612) was identified as the region that most potently bound to tubulin (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it appears that the region of the protein between amino acids 476 and 612 is important for direct interaction with tubulin. Tubulin Inhibits PLD2 Activity in Vitro—Because tubulin binds to PLD2, the effect of tubulin on the activity of PLD2 was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, tubulin inhibits PLD2 activity in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentration required for half-maximal inhibition was determined to be ∼2 nm in a PIP2-dependent PLD activity assay. To exclude the possibilities that the inhibition of PLD2 activity by tubulin is caused by PIP2 sequestration, we also performed a PLD2 activity assay in the absence of PIP2. Previously, we reported that PLD2 activity is stimulated by oleate in vitro (40Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PLD2 activation by oleate was found to be progressively inhibited by increasing the tubulin concentration with an IC50 of ∼10 nm. These results suggest that PLD2 activity is inhibited by direct interaction with tubulin. Microtubule Dynamics Affect the Interaction of PLD2 with Tubulin and PLD2 Activity in COS-7 Cells—To test whether microtubule dynamics affect interaction between PLD2 and tubulin and that of PLD activity in cells, we transfected the PLD2 genes into COS-7 cells, and treated them with nocodazole or Taxol to change the cellular monomeric tubulin concentrations. Nocodazole depolymerizes microtubules and causes the monomeric tubulin concentration to increase. On the other hand, Taxol polymerizes microtubules and causes a monomeric tubulin concentration reduction (Fig. 4A, upper panel). As shown Fig. 4A, when the protein complex containing PLD2 was isolated using anti-PLD antibody as a probe, endogenous tubulin was co-immunoprecipitated with PLD2 in COS-7 cells. Pretreatment with nocodazole increased the interaction between PLD2 and tubulin, but in Taxol-treated cells this interaction decreased. Interestingly, the changes in PLD activity were inversely correlated with the degree of interaction between PLD2 and tubulin (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that tubulin forms a complex with PLD2 in COS-7 cells, and that this interaction and PLD2 activity can be modulated by changing the cellular monomeric tubulin concentration. Carbachol Increase PLD2-Tubulin Interaction when Carbachol-induced PLD Activity Was Decreased—Previous studies have indicated that the muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol, rapidly causes microtubule depolymerization and translocation of tubulin to the plasma membrane (45Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2774-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate whether PLD2 activity can be regulated by tubulin by stimulating the muscarinic receptor signaling pathway, we monitored the carbachol-induced PLD2 activity in M3 acetylcholine receptor-expressed COS-7 cells. PLD2 activity was saturated in the presence of 100 μm carbachol (Fig. 5A). Under this condition, maximal PLD activity was obtained after 1 min but PLD activity was rapidly inhibited and reached baseline levels 2 min after carbachol was treated (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the interaction between PLD2 and tubulin was weak at baseline, but increased after 2 min of carbachol stimulation when PLD activ"

Early studies suggested that Nkd1 might play important roles in mouse embryonic development and tumorigenesis. We constructed Nkd1-/- mice whose Nkd1 protein lacked the EF-hand and was unable to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The homozygotes were viable and grew normally, but their fertility in males was reduced. In wild-type adult testes, Nkd1 mRNA was expressed more abundantly in the elongating spermatids than in the round spermatids. Lack of EF-hand caused reductions in the testis weight and sperm count by 30 and 60%, respectively. During testis development, Nkd1 mRNA expression started at the 25th day after birth, coincident with the onset of Wnt1 expression. Nuclear localization of β-catenin increased in the elongating spermatids, suggesting that the mutant Nkd1 failed to inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. These results suggest that deletion of the EF-hand from Nkd1 reduces the number of the elongating spermatids at haploid stage. In contrast, the mutant Nkd1 did not affect intestinal polyposis in ApcΔ716 mice. Nkd1 is an antagonist of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Development. 1994; 120: 369-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and binds to TCF transcription factors, initiating transcription of Wnt target genes (4He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H.

In contrast, Wnt signals activate c-Jun-N-terminal kinase via small GTPases to control epithelial cell polarity in Drosophila, which is a β-catenin-independent pathway that regulates planar cell polarity (6Mlodzik M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 564-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Two mouse homologs of Drosophila naked cuticle (nkd), Nkd1 and Nkd2, share the EF-hand motif with the fly nkd that is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the basic/PDZ domain of Dsh (7Rousset R.

In addition, co-expression of Nkd1 and Wnt in human cells or fly or Xenopus embryos negatively regulate the canonical Wnt pathway (8Zimmermann Jr, K.A. Zimmermann G. Rousset R. Scott M.P. Dev.

U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3802-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In particular, the intact EF-hand is required for the inhibitory function (10Yan D. Wallingford J.B. Sun T.Q. Nelson A.M. Sakanaka C. Reinhard C. Harland R.M. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3802-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). During mouse embryogenesis, the Nkd1 gene is inducible by Wnt signals and is expressed in multiple tissues in Wnt-like patterns, suggesting possible roles of Nkd1 in mouse development (8Zimmermann Jr, K.A. Zimmermann G. Rousset R. Scott M.P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Additionally, Nkd1 is also implicated in the planar cell polarity pathway through stimulation of the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, controlling the epithelial cell polarity in Drosophila and Xenopus (7Rousset R. Mack J.A. Wharton Jr., K.A. Axelrod J.D. Cadigan K.M. Fish M.P. Nusse R. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 658-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Yan D. Wallingford J.B. Sun T.Q.

Because Nkd1 and Apc play similar roles in the negative regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, the effects of Nkd1 mutation may be similar to those of Apc mutations in some tissues (10Yan D. Wallingford J.B. Sun T.Q. Nelson A.M. Sakanaka C. Reinhard C. Harland R.M. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3802-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the possible function of Nkd1 as a tumor suppressor has not yet been investigated in animal models. Notably, human naked cuticle (hNKD) mRNA is up-regulated in colon tumors whose Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated (11Yan D. Wiesmann M. Rodan M. Chan V. Jefferson A.B. Guo L. Sakamoto D.

In this study, we have generated Nkd1-/- mice lacking the EF-hand motif and investigated their phenotypes in development and tumorigenesis. Targeting Vector Construction—Mouse Nkd1, identified by its sequence similarity to fly nkd, was originally found as an expressed sequence tag, AI451741. This expressed sequence tag was used as a probe to screen the 129/SvJ mouse genomic library (Stratagene). One of the positive clones that contained an EcoRV fragment spanning exons 4 to 10 was used for vector construction (Fig. 1A). In the targeting vector, a genomic segment containing exons 5 and 6 was replaced with a PGKneobpA cassette. Nkd1-/- Mice—Mouse RW-4 embryonic stem cells (Genome Systems) were used. Heterozygous animals were identified by PCR and Southern blot analyses. PCR primers used for the wild-type allele were Nkd5-2 (5′-CTATACGAGCCTGTTGCCCA-3′) and Nkd3-1 (5′-GAGGAATCCTATGACCCTTCC-3′). The primers PGKF4 (5′-AGACGTGCTACTTCCATTTG-3′) and Nkd5-1 (5′-GGTCCCACTGAAGACACAAT-3′) were used to detect the targeted allele (Fig. 1A). Genomic DNA from embryonic stem cells or tail biopsy samples was digested with EcoRI-EcoRV or EcoRV alone. A 5′ wild-type probe external to the targeting vector sequence was used in hybridizations. RNA Analyses—Northern analysis of multiple tissues was performed using a membrane and the hybridization conditions according to the supplier (OriGene). The Nkd1 probe for codons 278–450 and the Nkd2 probe for codons 273–438 are specific to the Nkd1 and Nkd2 sequences, respectively (8Zimmermann Jr, K.A. Zimmermann G. Rousset R. Scott M.P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The probe for Wnt1 was prepared as described previously (13Wilkinson D.G. Bailes J.A. McMahon A.P. Cell. 1987; 50: 79-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH) probe was used as a loading control. For reverse transcription (RT)-PCR of testis RNA, the cDNA fragments for Nkd1 cDNA bases 269–1030 were amplified with primer 1 (5′-CGGGAACTCGTGGGTGACAC-3′), primer 2 (5′-AAGATCGACAGCCTAGGTAGTG-3′), and primer 3 (5′-AAGGAGCCTGGGTCCACACC-3′). RT-PCR of RNA from mouse polyps and surrounding normal tissues was performed with primer 1F (5′-GAAGATCGACAGCCTAGGTAGTGGA-3′), primer 1R1 (5′-CGTGGCAGCCTGCTGGGGTCTAGGG-3′), and primer 1R2 (5′-CTGTGTTTCCATGTGTCTTCTACAT-3′). RT-PCR analysis of Nkd2 was performed with primer 2F (5′-GAAACCACTACCTAGACCTTG-3′) and primer 2R (5′-ACAGGCATCACATAGCCCTCA-3′), amplifying nucleotides 938–1497 of the mouse Nkd2 cDNA. RT-PCR analysis of stage and germ cell-specific genes Dmc1h, Sycp3, and Clgn was performed as reported previously (14Tanaka S.S. Toyooka Y. Akasu R. Katoh-Fukui Y. Nakahara Y. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M.

Primers used for RT-PCR analysis of Nurit were NuF (5′-CCAACTAAGCAGTCGACTGA-3′) and NuR (5′-GCCTAAAGTGACCTTGTGCT-3′) (16Feige E. Chen A. Motro B. Mech. Dev. 2002; 117: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), amplifying nucleotides 106–670 of the mouse Nurit cDNA. The primers for the endozepine-like peptide (Dbil5) mRNA expression were primer ElF (5′-AATGAGCCAAGTGGAGTTTG-3′) and primer ElR (5′-AATCTTAAACCCGTCCCCTA-3′) (17Valentin M. Balvers M. Pusch W. Weinbauer G.F. Knudsen J. Ivell R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5438-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), amplifying nucleotides 1350–1677 of the mouse Dbil5 cDNA. Specific GAPDH and β-actin (Actb) primers were used as a loading control. In situ hybridization was performed essentially as described previously (18Mori C. Welch J.E. Sakai Y. Eddy E.M. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The probes were prepared from the same cDNA fragments for Northern blotting. Antibody Generation—Two peptides corresponding to the Nkd1 codons 1–11 (MGKLHSKPAAV) and 395–409 (APLGHKKHKHRAKES), respectively, were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the mixture of the above Nkd1 peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Immunoglobulin was purified from the antiserum with an antigen-conjugated activated CH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column, and its specificity was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot assays. Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (20Ishikawa T. Tamai Y. Li Q. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 230-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Harada N. Tamai Y. Ishikawa T. Sauer T. Takaku K. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5931-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). For detection of β-catenin, a rabbit polyclonal antibody or a monoclonal antibody for nuclear β-catenin (8E4; Alexis Biochemicals) was used. To detect Nkd1 protein, aliquots (100 μg of protein) were separated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and probed with the Nkd1 antibody. An antibody against β-actin was used for loading normalization. Generation of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)—Embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from 12.5–13.5-days post coitum embryos essentially as described (22Smits R. Kielman M.F. Breukel C. Zurcher C. Neufeld K. Jagmonhan-Changur S. Hofland N. van Dijk J. White R. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Khan P.M. Fodde R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1309-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). β-Catenin/Tcf Reporter Assays—Approximately 1 × 105 MEFs were transfected with 750 ng of pUSEWnt1 or pUSE vectors (Upstate Biology), 500 ng of TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH vectors (Upstate Biology), and 500 ng of the CMV-LacZ vector as described previously (20Ishikawa T.

Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry—The tumor susceptibility of Nkd1-/- mice was investigated with 25 mice older than 12 months of age (approximately equal numbers for both sexes). Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or hematoxylin alone, as described previously (23Oshima M. Oshima H. Kitagawa K. Kobayashi M. Itakura C. Taketo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4482-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). When needed, parts of testes were immersion-fixed in Bouin's solution, stained with periodic acid-Schiff, and counterstained with hematoxylin. We performed immunohistochemical procedures as described previously (21Harada N. Tamai Y. Ishikawa T. Sauer T. Takaku K. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5931-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) using a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (1:500, Sigma). Sperm Count and Motility Assay—Four-month-old male mice were euthanized with CO2. Epididymides were removed and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Sperm was allowed to disperse into the medium for 3 h at 32 °C. Total sperm counts were scored with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl dilutions in a hemocytometer. For sperm motility assay, caudal epididymides were incubated in human tubal fluid buffer as described previously (24Quinn P. Kerin J.F. Warnes G.M. Fertil. Steril. 1985; 44: 493-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination was performed under a phase-contrast microscope. Fractionation of the Testicular Cells—Four testes were collected from two males for each genotype (Nkd1+/+, Nkd1+/-, or Nkd1-/-) at 4 months of age. Fractionation was performed essentially as described previously (25Koga M. Tanaka H. Yomogida K. Tsuchida J. Uchida K. Kitamura M. Sakoda S. Matsumiya K. Okuyama A. Nishimune Y. Biol.

Intestinal Polyp Scoring—The numbers and size of polyps in 12-week-old mice were scored as described previously (23Oshima M. Oshima H. Kitagawa K. Kobayashi M. Itakura C. Taketo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4482-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Labeling Index Analysis and Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End-labeling (TUNEL) Assay—Bromodeoxyuridine labeling was performed as described previously (27Oshima H. Oshima M. Kobayashi M. Tsutsumi M. Taketo M.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1644-1649PubMed Google Scholar). A TUNEL assay was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Wako) according to the manufacturer's protocol (28Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9100) Google Scholar). Generation of Nkd1-/- Mice—We designed a gene-targeting vector to delete a genomic segment including exons 5 and 6, which encode most of the EF-hand-containing oxygen donation and ion-binding domains (Figs. 1A and 2D). Because the reading frame in exons 5 and 6 are in phase with that in exons 4 and 7, the knock-out mutation should produce a mutant protein deleted in the EF-hand domain (see below). Mutant Nkd1 proteins with substituted or deleted residues in this motif fail to inhibit the canonical Wnt pathway (10Yan D. Wallingford J.B. Sun T.Q. Nelson A.M. Sakanaka C. Reinhard C. Harland R.M. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3802-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Successful homologous recombination was confirmed by restriction mapping of the Nkd1 allele in G418-selected embryonic stem cell clone number 13 (Fig. 1B). The chimeric mice derived from the clone transmitted the targeted Nkd1 allele to the offspring (Fig. 1C). Nkd1-/- Mice Are Unable to Inhibit the Canonical Wnt Pathway—Northern hybridization for the testis and small intestine mRNA showed that the size of Nkd1 mRNA was smaller in the Nkd1-/- mice (1.6-kb) compared with that in the Nkd1+/+ littermates (1.8-kb) (Fig. 2A). To confirm the deletion of exons 5 and 6 in the mutant Nkd1 allele, we performed an RT-PCR analysis and sequenced the products. Primers 1 and 3 amplified both the wild-type and targeted Nkd1 alleles, whereas primers 2 and 3 detected only the wild-type (Fig. 2B). Disruption of exons 5 and 6 of Nkd1 deleted 68 amino acids (Fig. 2D), reducing the molecular mass of Nkd1 from 54 to 45 kDa (Fig. 2C). Nkd1+/+ controls showed a 54-kDa wild-type protein band in germ cells and the small intestine. In Nkd1+/- mice, the amount of the normal Nkd1 protein was reduced by half with an additional band of 45 kDa, representing the mutant Nkd1 protein (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the wild-type Nkd1 band was absent in Nkd1-/- mice with only the mutant Nkd1 band (Fig. 2C). We used human colon cancer cell line SW480 as a positive control in which nuclear β-catenin and Nkd1 levels were elevated by the activated Wnt signaling caused by APC mutations (11Yan D. Wiesmann M. Rodan M. Chan V. Jefferson A.B. Guo L. Sakamoto D. Caothien R.H. Fuller J.H. Reinhard C. Garcia P.D. Randazzo F.M. Escobedo J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14973-14978Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 12Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 963-969PubMed Google Scholar). As a negative control without Wnt activation, we used RKO cells (Fig. 2C, 6B). These results indicate that the wild-type Nkd1 protein was replaced with the mutant protein lacking most of the EF-hand motif in the Nkd1-/- testis and small intestine. To determine whether the mutant Nkd1 protein is incapable of inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we performed transient transfections of MEFs with luciferase reporter constructs controlled by active (pTOPFLASH) and mutant Tcf-binding motifs (pFOPFLASH), respectively. In Wnt signaling-activated cells, β-catenin can translocate to the nucleus and form a complex with Tcf, the activity of which can be monitored by transcription of the pTOPFLASH reporter with a negative control of the pFOPFLASH mutant. Levels of both wild-type and knock-out Nkd1 transcripts increased significantly (3.4- and 4.3-fold, respectively) in MEFs transfected with Wnt1 for 36 h, compared with cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 2E). The results confirmed that Nkd1 was induced by Wnt1 as reported previously (7Rousset R. Mack J.A. Wharton Jr., K.A. Axelrod J.D. Cadigan K.M. Fish M.P. Nusse R. Scott M.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 658-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8Zimmermann Jr, K.A. Zimmermann G. Rousset R. Scott M.P. Dev.

U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3802-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the Wnt1-transfected MEFs, the relative transcriptional activity of pTOPFLASH to that of pFOPFLASH was significantly higher in Nkd1-/- (22.7-fold) than that in Nkd1+/+ (7.5-fold) MEFs (Fig. 2F). These results indicate that Nkd1-/- MEFs were significantly compromised in the inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway. The results are consistent with a report that mutations in the EF-hand of Nkd1 result in suppression of the inhibitory effects against the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in cultured mammalian cells (10Yan D. Wallingford J.B. Sun T.Q. Nelson A.M. Sakanaka C. Reinhard C. Harland R.M. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3802-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We also excluded the possibility that our mutant Nkd1 showed a dominant-negative activity, because the relative TOPFLASH transcriptional activity in Nkd1+/- MEFs was essentially identical with that in the wild-type MEFs (Fig. 2F). To determine whether lack of Nkd1 was compensated by increased expression of Nkd2 (8Zimmermann Jr, K.A. Zimmermann G. Rousset R. Scott M.P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we performed an RT-PCR analysis of Nkd2 mRNA (Fig. 2G). The mRNA levels were not different between the Nkd1+/+ and Nkd1-/- 7-day embryos, testes, or small intestines. Notably, Nkd2 mRNA was not detectable with Northern blotting except in the skin (see below; Fig. 3A). Phenotypes of Nkd1 Mutant Mice—The heterozygous (Nkd1+/-) mice were viable and fertile and exhibited no obvious impairment in growth, development, or reproductivity. The Nkd1-/- pups were born from Nkd1+/- parents at the Mendelian ratio, indicating that the disruption of the EF-hand of Nkd1 did not result in embryonic lethality. Although Nkd1-/- mice grew normally and appeared healthy, they showed reduced fertility (Table I). A Northern blot from various organs of the wild-type adults revealed a broad distribution of Nkd1 mRNA (Fig. 3A). Histological analysis of the Nkd1-/- mice for Nkd1-expressing organs such as lungs, kidneys, liver, heart, or the small intestine revealed no tumor lesions (data not shown). On the other hand, the testes of the Nkd1-/- males were smaller than those of their wild-type littermates (Fig. 3B). Consistently, the testis weights were significantly reduced in the Nkd1-/- males (Table I). Moreover, the seminiferous tubular diameters were slightly but significantly reduced in Nkd1-/- testes (Table I).Table IBody and testis weights, litter sizes, and seminiferous tubule diameters of Nkd1+/+ and Nkd1-/- mice For mouse breeding, 3- to 5-month-old male Nkd1-/- and control mice were caged with wild-type females (C57BL/6J) for 2 weeks. One male was bred to two reproductively active females.

The testicular cross-sections of the Nkd1-/- mice showed germ cells from all stages of spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubule (data not shown), indicating that spermatogenesis proceeds as in the Nkd1+/+ tubules (Fig. 3, C and D). We also found no difference in the sperm morphology between Nkd1+/+ and Nkd1-/- mice (data not shown). However, the sperm count of Nkd1-/- males were reduced by 60% compared with that of the wild-type littermates (Fig. 3E). On the other hand, sperm motility was not affected in the Nkd1-/- mice (Fig. 3F). Accordingly, we next scored the numbers of spermatozoa in tubular cross-sections from these mouse testes. Specifically, the numbers of mature spermatozoa were counted under blind codes and normalized for the numbers of spermatogonia. The spermatozoon number from Nkd1-/- mutants was reduced by 25% compared with that of wild-type littermates (Fig. 3G). Furthermore, the number of spermatozoon-containing tubuli per 100 tubuli was significantly reduced in the Nkd1-/- testis sections (from 70.8 ± 2.5 to 54.6 ± 7.3; mean ± S.D.) (Fig. 3H). Taken together, these data indicate that spermatogenesis was significantly compromised in Nkd1-/- testes. To investigate whether Nkd1-/- spermatogonia correctly enter the initial meiotic division and postmeiotic stages, we determined the expression of specific marker genes for different spermatogenic stages (14Tanaka S.S.

No difference was found between the two genotypes for expression of the disrupted meiotic cDNA gene (Dmc1h, which appears in early spermatogenic cells before they reach the pachytene spermatocyte stage) (14Tanaka S.S.

Naquet P. Samson M. Nguyen C. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2003; 3: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3I). These results indicate that Nkd1-/- spermatocytes develop normally up to and beyond the pachytene stage and proceed further to the round spermatid stage. In contrast, we found in the Nkd1-/- testes significantly lower levels of expression for “nurit” (Nurit, which is present in step 9 spermatids) (16Feige E. Chen A. Motro B. Mech. Dev. 2002; 117: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the endozepine-like peptide (Dbil5, which is expressed in late haploid stage of the elongating spermatids, step 14–16 spermatids to mature spermatozoa) (17Valentin M. Balvers M. Pusch W. Weinbauer G.F. Knudsen J. Ivell R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5438-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3I). The latter results suggest that the reduced sperm count in the Nkd1-/- testes may have been caused by the loss of elongating spermatids at the haploid stage. Nkd1 mRNA Expression in Mouse Testes—In mice, the first wave of spermatogenesis begins shortly after birth, with the first meiotic divisions taking place at postnatal day ∼20, and the first set of spermatozoa is produced by day 35 (29Shackleford G.M. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Based on the high expression of Wnt1 mRNA in the round spermatids (29Shackleford G.M. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we analyzed the onset of testicular expression for Nkd1 mRNA and compared it with that for Wnt1. Nkd1 mRNA was detected first in the 4th week after birth (Fig. 4A). Precisely, the expression of"

Therefore, we took several experimental approaches to investigate the role of ubiquitinated H2A (uH2A) in the binding of linker histones. Our results showed that uH2A was present in situ in histone H1-containing nucleosomes. Notably in vitro experiments using nucleosomes reconstituted onto 167-bp random sequence and 208-bp (5 S rRNA gene) DNA fragments showed that ubiquitination of H2A did not prevent binding of histone H1 but it rather enhanced the binding of this histone to the nucleosome. We also showed that ubiquitination of H2A did not affect the positioning of the histone octamer in the nucleosome in either the absence or the presence of linker histones. Histone H2A ubiquitination is a bulky posttranslational modification that occurs at the vicinity of the binding site for linker histones in the nucleosome.

Despite the renewed interest in histone H2A/H2B ubiquitination (1Jason L.J. Moore S.C. Lewis J.D. Lindsey G. Ausió J.

This is in contrast to ubiquitinated H2B where a strong correlation with transcriptional activation has long been established (2Osley M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and even a molecular mechanism involving a transhistone regulatory pathway has been shown to be involved in this process (4Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 5Briggs S.D. Xiao T. Sun Z.W. Caldwell J.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Strahl B.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 498Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). With uH2A, there is almost as much experimental evidence for its association to actively transcribing chromatin as there is to the opposite. For instance, it was shown that nucleosomes from the transcriptionally poised hsp70 and copia genes from Drosophila contain 50% uH2A (6Levinger L. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1982; 28: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Also nucleosomes containing mono- and diubiquitinated H2A were found to preferentially occur near the 5′-end of the transcribed mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene (7Barsoum J. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7688-7697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, early studies with rat liver nuclei linked the disappearance of uH2A to increased transcription (8Ballal N.R. Kang Y.J. Olson M.O. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5921-5925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was shown that Drosophila nucleosomes consisting of non-transcribed 1.705 satellite DNA showed an enrichment in uH2A (9Levinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11799-11804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In support of these early data, a role for histone uH2A in Polycomb silencing has been demonstrated recently (10Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Furthermore uH2A has been shown to be concentrated in the heterochromatic inactive sex body in pachytene spermatocytes (11Baarends W.M. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Roest H.P. Ooms M. Vreeburg J. Hoeijmakers J.H. Grootegoed J.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Nevertheless the molecular mechanism(s) involved remains completely unknown. Despite the controversy, ubiquitinated histones have been associated with chromatin partially depleted of linker histones (12Davie J.R. Nickel B.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Van Holde K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is evidence that suggests that histone H2A ubiquitination does not interfere with linker histone binding. Two independent studies have shown that H1 can be cross-linked to uH2A in vitro (15Nelson P.P. Albright S.C. Wiseman J.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11751-11760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (16Bonner W.M. Stedman J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the cross-linking studies performed in mouse cells, the molar ratio of H1-uH2A to H1-H2A was the same as the molar ratio of uH2A to H2A (16Bonner W.M. Stedman J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Linker histones are required for the stabilization of well defined chromatin fibers (17Thoma F. Koller T. Klug A. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 18Allan J. Cowling G.J. Harborne N. Cattini P. Craigie R. Gould H. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and interference with the binding of linker histones could affect chromatin condensation or the stability of the folded structures. Under physiological conditions, the structure of most linker histones is comprised of three domains: a strongly basic unstructured NH2-terminal tail, a nonpolar globular domain, and another strongly basic unstructured tail at the COOH terminus (20Hartman P.G. Chapman G.E. Moss T. Bradbury E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the globular domain of histones H1 and H5 has been determined using two-dimensional NMR (21Cerf C. Lippens G. Muyldermans S. Segers A. Ramakrishnan V. Wodak S.J. Hallenga K. Wyns L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11345-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nilges M. Sukumaran D.K. Zarbock J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1833-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the structure of the globular domain of histone H5 was further resolved to 2.5 Å following the determination of its crystal structure (23Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Interestingly the three-helix bundle structure of the globular domain of histone H5 has been reported to resemble that of the bacterial catabolite gene activator protein (22Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nilges M. Sukumaran D.K. Zarbock J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1833-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) as well as that of the DNA recognition motif of hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 (HNF-3), a Drosophila transcription factor (22Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nilges M. Sukumaran D.K. Zarbock J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1833-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This structural similarity led to a model in which the primary binding site of linker histones to DNA is comprised of helix III of the globular domain binding to the major groove and binding of the β-hairpin to the adjacent minor groove (21Cerf C. Lippens G. Muyldermans S. Segers A. Ramakrishnan V. Wodak S.J. Hallenga K. Wyns L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11345-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Despite this, the position of the globular domain of a linker histone on the nucleosome has been quite controversial and may indeed be variable. The issue of the symmetrical or asymmetrical protection of the flanking DNA ends by histone H1 in the chromatosome remains unsettled (24An W. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4042-4046Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the precise location of the globular domain on the vicinity of the pseudodyad axis is now well established (for reviews, see Refs. 26Crane-Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 75-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 27Travers A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 4-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of H2A has been found to make contacts with the linker DNA in nucleosomes containing at least 167 bp of associated DNA (28Davies N. Lindsey G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1129: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Usachenko S.I. Bavykin S.G. Gavin I.M. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the case of core particles lacking linker DNA, the H2A COOH tail repositions to contact the DNA of the dyad axis (29Usachenko S.I. Bavykin S.G. Gavin I.M. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The H2A COOH tail is therefore likely to have some influence on linker histone binding at the nucleosomal level since some DNA contact sites are shared. The crystal structure of the nucleosome (30Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6842) Google Scholar) indicates that the H2A COOH-terminal tail emerges from the nucleosome near the proposed site of the linker histone globular domain. It has been shown that the contacts between the H2A COOH-terminal tail and the linker DNA are altered slightly in the presence of linker histone (31Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8622-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Guschin D. Chandler S. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8629-8636Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) indicating that the H2A tail domain is repositioned upon linker histone binding. Ubiquitination of H2A is a bulky modification that occurs at lysine 119 at the beginning of the COOH-terminal tail (1Jason L.J. Moore S.C. Lewis J.D. Lindsey G. Ausió J. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and it would therefore be expected to interfere with linker histone binding. In this work, we used a defined in vitro system using individually purified components to investigate the effects of histone ubiquitination on linker histone binding. The results obtained with this system indicate that, contrary to the expectations, ubiquitination of histone H2A did not preclude but rather favored the binding of linker histones to nucleosomes. This observation is in very good agreement with the latest transcriptional silencing role ascribed to this histone H2A modification (10Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Isolation of Chicken Erythrocyte Nuclei, Nucleosomes, and Core Histones—Chicken nuclei and nucleosome core particles were prepared as described previously (33Jason L.J. Moore S.C. Ausió J. Lindsey G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14597-14601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Alternatively bulk nucleosomes were isolated from chicken erythrocyte nuclei following a protocol based on the method described by Olins et al. (35Olins A.L. Carlson R.D. Wright E.B. Olins D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 3271-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly in this method the nuclear chromatin (at approximately 6 mg/ml of DNA) in 0.1 m KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm CaCl2) buffer is subjected to an extensive micrococcal nuclease digestion (150 units of micrococcal nuclease for 24 min at 37 °C), and the whole nuclear digest is then hypotonically lysed by extensive dialysis against 0.25 mm EDTA. The dialysate is next centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant is dialyzed again against 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to precipitate the linker histone-containing nucleosomes. Centrifugation under the same conditions as above leads to a supernatant consisting of linker histone-depleted nucleosome fraction and a linker histone fraction in the pellet. Histones from both fractions were extracted with 0.5 n HCl and precipitated overnight at 4 °C with 6 volumes of acetone. Purification of Linker Histones from Chicken Erythrocyte Nuclei— Extraction of linker histones from chicken erythrocyte nuclei was carried out using CM Sephadex C-25 as described by Garcia Ramirez and colleagues (36Garcia Ramirez M. Leuba S.H. Ausió J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1990; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Purified linker histones were stored in 50% (v/v) glycerol at -20 °C and were found to remain stable for up to 1 year. Storage in glycerol counteracts the problem of histone precipitation that occurs upon repeated freezing and thawing of histone samples as reported by Kaplan et al. (37Kaplan L.J. Bauer R. Morrison E. Langan T.A. Fasman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8777-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation and Purification of Calf uH2A—uH2A was purified from calf thymus histones with a slight modification of the protocols described elsewhere (38Davies N. Lindsey G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39Thorne A.W. Sautière P. Briand G. Crane Robinson C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly ∼250 mg of 0.4 n HCl-extracted histones were chromatographed at room temperature on a 4.5 × 100-cm BioGel P60 (100–200 mesh) column in 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm HCl buffer (40von Holt C. Brandt W.F. Greyling H.J. Lindsey G.G. Retief J.D. Rodrigues J.D. Schwager S. Sewell B.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 431-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) at a flow rate of 40 ml/h. H2A fractions from three BioGel P60 column runs were pooled, adjusted to 6 m urea and 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.4), and loaded onto a 1.5 × 20-cm Whatman CM 52 column equilibrated in 6 m urea, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.4). Bound proteins were eluted at room temperature with a linear salt gradient (125–175 mm NaCl) in the same buffer. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing uH2A were pooled, dialyzed against 40 liters of deionized water, and lyophilized. Finally pooled fractions from three Whatman CM 52 columns were lyophilized; resuspended in 8 m urea, 2 mm Tris-HCl, and 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol; and rolled for 4 h at 4 °C. The pH was adjusted to 2.2 (39Thorne A.W. Sautière P. Briand G. Crane Robinson C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with HCl, and the solution was applied to a 2.5 × 100-cm BioGel P60 (100–200 mesh) column equilibrated in 7 m urea and 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 2.2). The flow rate used was 4 ml/h, and ∼0.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing pure uH2A were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, and dialyzed against deionized water. Native 4.5% PAGE—Native 4.5% PAGE in 20 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) buffer for the analysis of nucleosome core particles was carried out according to Yager and van Holde (41Yager T.D. van Holde K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4212-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE—Electrophoretic analysis of the histones was carried out by SDS-PAGE (20% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.1% (w/v) N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide)) according to Ref. 42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar. On occasion (Western blots) the precast NuPAGE Novex bis-Tris gels from Invitrogen were used. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was carried out using a rabbit polyclonal antibody prepared in our laboratory. The primary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1,000, and the dilution of the secondary (goat anti-rabbit) was 1:10,000. Reconstitution of Histone Octamers—Histone octamers consisting of native H2A or uH2A were reconstituted as described previously (38Davies N. Lindsey G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40von Holt C. Brandt W.F. Greyling H.J. Lindsey G.G. Retief J.D. Rodrigues J.D. Schwager S. Sewell B.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 431-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Preparation of 167-bp Random Sequence DNA—Preparation of 167-bp nucleosome cores was carried out as described in Ref. 43Lindsey G.G. Thompson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar. DNA was purified from these nucleosomes by phenol extraction. Purification of Defined Sequence DNA Templates—p5S 208-12 plasmid containing 12 tandem repeats of a 208-bp sequence derived from the Lytechinus 5 S rRNA gene (44Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) was prepared as described elsewhere (45Ausió J. Moore S.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The 208-12 DNA and 208 DNA were excised from the plasmid by HhaI and AvaI digestion, respectively. DNA fragments of interest were separated from the remainder of the plasmid by centrifugation through a linear 5–12% (w/v) sucrose gradient in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA) buffer for 16 h at 4 °C at 111,000 × g. Reconstitution of Nucleosomes—Nucleosome cores were reconstituted onto purified 167-bp random sequence or sequence-defined 208-bp 5 S rDNA fragments using the reconstituted hybrid chicken erythrocyte octamers as a histone source containing either calf H2A (control) or calf uH2A and following the procedures already described (45Ausió J. Moore S.C. Methods. 1998; 15: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Linker Histones onto Nucleosome Cores—Nucleosomes were reconstituted with linker histones (chicken erythrocyte H1) by either direct addition (25Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or by salt dialysis. In this latter instance, reconstituted nucleosome cores and linker histones in 550 mm NaC1, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) were mixed in the ratios stated in the text and dialyzed for at least 4 h against 10 mm NaC1, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The reconstituted products were purified by 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradient fractionation in 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at 111,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C, and fractions were analyzed by 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.3)) buffer. DNA Melting Profiles—Reconstituted nucleosome samples at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in the buffer specified in the text were heated at a rate of 1 °C/min from 30 to 100 °C. Absorbance at 260 nm was recorded every 0.3 °C using a Pye Unicam SP 1800 spectrophotometer equipped with a custom made temperature controller interfaced to an analog to digital device (Oasis/4, 3D Digital Design and Development Ltd., London, UK) and an IBM 386 computer. Where indicated, the first derivatives of A260 versus temperature profiles were numerically deconvoluted by fitting a sum of Gaussian curves using a Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm. 2P. Hüsler, unpublished. Determination of Nucleosome and Chromatosome Positioning—The positioning of the histone octamer in the nucleosomes and chromatosomes reconstituted onto 208-bp 5 S rDNA was carried out as described elsewhere (46Dong F. Hansen J.C. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5724-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 47Howe L. Iskandar M. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11625-11629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Histone uH2A Is Equally Distributed in Histone H1-containing and Histone H1-depleted Nucleosome Fractions—As mentioned in the Introduction there is some evidence that histone H1 does not preclude histone H2A ubiquitination (15Nelson P.P. Albright S.C. Wiseman J.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11751-11760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bonner W.M. Stedman J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further analyze this, chicken erythrocyte chromatin was extensively digested with micrococcal nuclease followed by dialysis in 0.1 m KCl. This is based on an early salt fractionation method described by Olins et al. (35Olins A.L. Carlson R.D. Wright E.B. Olins D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 3271-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) that allows fractionation of the linker histone-containing nucleosome fractions from the linker histone-depleted nucleosome fractions. The KCl-insoluble nucleosome fraction consisted of a DNA band centered around 165 bp (chromatosome) and a band centered at 120 bp resulting from nucleosome core particle overdigestion (see Fig. 1A, 2). Overdigestion of nucleosome DNA beyond 146 bp led to precipitation of the resulting subnucleosome particles. The DNA from the soluble fraction almost exclusively consisted of 146-bp DNA from nucleosome core particles (see Fig. 1A, 1). As it can also be seen in this figure, when a Western blot analysis was performed on an equivalent amount of histones obtained from both the 0.1 m KCl-soluble and -insoluble fractions using a ubiquitin-specific antibody, the intensity of the signal corresponding to uH2A was the same in both fractions (Fig. 1C). Histone H2A Ubiquitination Does Not Preclude Histone H1 Binding—Nucleosomes consisting of either H2A or uH2A were reconstituted onto random sequence 167-bp DNA, and the binding of histone H1 was assessed. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to reconstitute histone H1 by direct addition (results not shown). The failure of linker histone reconstitution by direct addition was attributed to the histone octamers adopting an equilibrium position on the 167-bp DNA that was unfavorable to successfully form chromatosomes. It has been shown previously that octamer position can affect linker histone binding (48Hamiche A. Schultz P. Ramakrishnan V. Oudet P. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The short length (≤22 bp) of the linker region available for H1 binding could also contribute to this problem. Therefore, we decided to use a linker histone reconstitution technique that involves addition of the linker histones to nucleosomes or chromatin at elevated salt concentrations (0.5–0.6 m NaCl) and subsequent dialysis into low salt buffer (see “Materials and Methods”). At the high salt concentrations, the cationic charges of linker histones are shielded, and ionic interactions with the chromatin DNA are disrupted. If unfavorable octamer positions were inhibiting correct linker histone binding, this reconstitution protocol should allow repositioning of the octamer since it is known that octamers are mobile on DNA (49Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) especially at higher salt concentrations (50Spadafora C. Oudet P. Chambon P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The histone composition of the chromatosome peaks from the sucrose gradient fractionation following the reconstitution procedure are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. These results showed that uH2A did not prevent linker histone binding to 167-bp nucleosome cores in agreement with previous results (15Nelson P.P. Albright S.C. Wiseman J.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11751-11760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bonner W.M. Stedman J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and that linker histone binding was slightly favored in the presence of uH2A. The H1 content of uH2A hybrid and control 167-bp cores reached the levels found in a total acid extract of calf thymus at a molar input ratio of 1 and 1.3 histone H1/167-bp nucleosome core DNA, respectively. A t test for independent samples with 95% confidence was performed at each histone H1 input ratio for the results shown in Fig. 2 using Statistica (Statsoft) software. The results indicated that there was no statistical difference between control and uH2A hybrid nucleosome cores except at a molar input ratio of 1.2 histone H1/nucleosome core. Gel retardation assays were also used to monitor the reassociation of histone H1 to control and uH2A hybrid 167-bp nucleosome cores by salt dialysis (Fig. 3). In agreement with Fig. 2, uH2A hybrid chromatosomes were formed at slightly lower histone H1 concentrations than those required to form control chromatosomes. Histone H2A Ubiquitination Does Not Lead to a Major Disruption of the Octamer-DNA Interactions in the Chromatosome—Control and uH2A hybrid 167-bp cores reconstituted at an input ratio of 1.2 mol of chicken erythrocyte histone H1/mol of nucleosome core (as above) were analyzed by thermal denaturation (Fig. 4). Under the conditions used, all samples exhibited a triphasic hyperchromicity curve. The first two transitions are thought to be associated with the melting of the DNA associated with the ends of the nucleosome core, while protein denaturation and melting of the DNA more tightly associated with core histones represent the main transition (51van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar, 52Cowman M.K. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 532-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In 167-bp control and uH2A hybrid nucleosome cores, the first transition occurred at 69 and 68 °C and represented 13% (21 bp) and 15% (25 bp) of the DNA, respectively. This could reflect a slightly decreased interaction of histone tails with the ends of the nucleosome core DNA in the presence of uH2A. This decrease in protein-DNA interaction was more subtle than that caused by core histone acetylation where a decrease of 3 °C in the Tm of the first transition was observed (53Ausió J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the presence of linker histones, the first transition decreased in magnitude and shifted to ∼70 °C for both control and uH2A hybrid chromatosomes. This decrease in magnitude of the first transition was slightly more pronounced for the uH2A hybrid chromatosomes than for control chromatosomes. The association of linker histones with the ends of the core DNA would be expected to stabilize this DNA, correlating with the observed increase in the Tm value of the first transition of 1 and 2 °C for control and uH2A hybrid chromatosomes, respectively. The second and third transitions of both samples occurred at 79 and 83.8 °C, respectively, indicating that the presence of uH2A did not lead to large scale disruption of octamer-DNA interactions in good agreement with previous observations (38Davies N. Lindsey G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 54Kleinschmidt A.M. Martinson H.G.

Histone H1 Equally Affects the Positioning of the Histone Octamer in the Chromatosome Regardless of the Ubiquitinated Nature of Histone H2A—We decided next to determine the effect of ubiquitination of H2A on the position of chromatosomes on 5 S rDNA. To this end, chicken histone H1 was reconstituted with control and uH2A hybrid nucleosomes by direct addition at 50 mm NaCl (25Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As described above, this methodology was not suitable for reconstituting linker histones onto 167-bp nucleosome cores. However, direct addition of linker histones to 208-bp nucleosomes res"
https://openalex.org/W2047858410,"In the chytridiomycete fungus, Spizellomyces punctatus, all eight of the mitochondrially encoded tRNAs are predicted to have one or more base pair mismatches at the first three positions of their aminoacyl acceptor stems. These tRNAs are edited post-transcriptionally by replacement of the 5′-nucleotide in each mismatched pair with a nucleotide that can form a standard Watson-Crick base pair with its counterpart in the 3′-half of the stem. The type of mitochondrial tRNA editing found in S. punctatus also occurs in Acanthamoeba castellanii, a distantly related amoeboid protist. Using an S. punctatus mitochondrial extract, we have developed an in vitro assay of tRNA editing in which nucleotides are incorporated into various tRNA substrates. Experiments employing synthetic transcripts revealed that the S. punctatus tRNA editing activity incorporates nucleotides on the 5′-side of substrate tRNAs, uses the 3′-sequence as a template for incorporation, and adds nucleotides in a 3′-to-5′ direction. This activity can add nucleotides to a triphosphorylated 5′-end in the absence of ATP but requires ATP to add nucleotides to a monophosphorylated 5′-end; moreover, it functions independently of the state of tRNA 3′ processing. These data parallel results obtained in a previous in vitro study of A. castellanii tRNA editing, suggesting that remarkably similar activities function in the mitochondria of these two organisms. The evolutionary origins of these activities are discussed. In the chytridiomycete fungus, Spizellomyces punctatus, all eight of the mitochondrially encoded tRNAs are predicted to have one or more base pair mismatches at the first three positions of their aminoacyl acceptor stems. These tRNAs are edited post-transcriptionally by replacement of the 5′-nucleotide in each mismatched pair with a nucleotide that can form a standard Watson-Crick base pair with its counterpart in the 3′-half of the stem. The type of mitochondrial tRNA editing found in S. punctatus also occurs in Acanthamoeba castellanii, a distantly related amoeboid protist. Using an S. punctatus mitochondrial extract, we have developed an in vitro assay of tRNA editing in which nucleotides are incorporated into various tRNA substrates. Experiments employing synthetic transcripts revealed that the S. punctatus tRNA editing activity incorporates nucleotides on the 5′-side of substrate tRNAs, uses the 3′-sequence as a template for incorporation, and adds nucleotides in a 3′-to-5′ direction. This activity can add nucleotides to a triphosphorylated 5′-end in the absence of ATP but requires ATP to add nucleotides to a monophosphorylated 5′-end; moreover, it functions independently of the state of tRNA 3′ processing. These data parallel results obtained in a previous in vitro study of A. castellanii tRNA editing, suggesting that remarkably similar activities function in the mitochondria of these two organisms. The evolutionary origins of these activities are discussed. RNA editing encompasses particular forms of RNA processing that change the primary sequence of an RNA molecule from that predicted by the gene sequence. The term “RNA editing” was coined to describe post-transcriptional U insertions within the mitochondrial cox2 transcript of two trypanosome species: insertions that correct a gene-predicted frameshift, thereby generating a functional mRNA (1Van den Benne R. Burg J. Brakenhoff J.P. Sloof P. Van Boom J.H. Tromp M.C. Cell. 1986; 46: 819-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Editing has since been found to be an essential process in many diverse, predominantly organellar, systems (2Gray M.W. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Many cases of mRNA editing have been identified, including uridylate insertion/deletion in trypanosome mitochondria (3Simpson L. Sbicego S. Aphasizhev R.

ASM Press, Washington1998: 289-305Google Scholar) can be substrates for editing. Editing of tRNA has been described in the mitochondria of many organisms. In plant mitochondria, C-to-U editing repairs mismatches in tRNA stems (17Binder S. Marchfelder A. Brennicke A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Maréchal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Remacle C. Ramamonjisoa D. Dietrich A. Mol. Cell.

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). C and U insertion occurs within myxomycete mitochondrial tRNAs, creating base pairs in stems as well as restoring the GUUC sequence in the T stem-loop (21Antes T. Costandy H. Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Miller D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7521-7527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In marsupial mitochondria, C-to-U editing alters the anticodon of mitochondrial tRNAAsp, changing the decoding potential (22Janke A. Pääbo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1523-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Mörl M. Dörner M. Pääbo S.

Similarly, C-to-U editing changes the decoding properties of trypanosome mitochondrial tRNATrp (25Alfonzo J.D. Blanc V. Estévez A.M. Rubio M.A.T. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7056-7062Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Non-templated editing within the 3′-half of tRNA acceptor stems, including the discriminator position, has been described in the mitochondria of several animals (26Yokobori S. Pääbo S. Nature. 1995; 377: 490Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Yokobori S. Pääbo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10432-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Tomita K. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4987-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Further, in the centipede Lithobius forficatus, nucleotides are added to the 3′-end of mitochondrial tRNAs, apparently using the 5′-half of the acceptor stem as a template (29Lavrov D.V. Brown W.M. Boore J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13738-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, editing similar to that found in L. forficatus repairs mismatches in mitochondrial tRNA acceptor stems in the protist Seculamonas ecuadoriensis, a jakobid flagellate (30Leigh J. Lang B.F. RNA. 2004; 10: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An additional type of editing, and the first example of tRNA editing to be described, occurs in the mitochondria of the amoeboid protist Acanthamoeba castellanii (31Lonergan K.M. Gray M.W. Science. 1993; 259: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this organism, 12 of 15 mtDNA 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; nt, nucleotide; HTGT, histidine tRNA guanylyltransferase; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; TLC, thin-layer chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; nt, nucleotide; HTGT, histidine tRNA guanylyltransferase; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; TLC, thin-layer chromatography.-encoded tRNAs are predicted to contain mismatches in one or more of the first three base pairs of the acceptor stem. These mismatches are such that they appear incompatible with canonical tRNA folding and function. Direct sequencing of tRNA 5′-ends (31Lonergan K.M. Gray M.W. Science. 1993; 259: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) as well as a tRNA circularization/RT-PCR approach (32Price D.H. Gray M.W. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have revealed that these mismatches are repaired in vivo by removing the 5′-nucleotide from each mismatched pair and replacing it with a nucleotide that has the potential to form a Watson-Crick base pair with its counterpart in the 3′-half of the stem. The A. castellanii editing activity is hypothesized to consist of at least two components: an endonuclease and/or 5′-to-3′ exonuclease that removes mismatched nucleotides from tRNA 5′-ends, and a template-directed 3′-to-5′ nucleotidyltransferase activity that restores acceptor stem base pairing (31Lonergan K.M. Gray M.W. Science. 1993; 259: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 33Price D.H. Gray M.W. RNA. 1999; 5: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An in vitro assay developed to study this form of editing (33Price D.H. Gray M.W. RNA. 1999; 5: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) has demonstrated nucleotide incorporation into various tRNA substrates. Nucleotide addition occurs at recessed tRNA 5′-ends, requires ATP when the 5′-terminus is monophosphorylated, and proceeds in a 3′-to-5′ direction using the 3′-half of the acceptor stem as a template. In Spizellomyces punctatus, a chytridiomycete fungus, all eight of the mtDNA-encoded tRNAs are predicted to contain mismatches at one or more of the first three acceptor stem positions (34Laforest M-J. Roewer I. Lang B.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These mismatches are repaired in vivo, as in A. castellanii, by replacement of the 5′-nucleotide in the pair to form Watson-Crick base pairs, as shown by direct sequencing of tRNA 5′-ends (34Laforest M-J. Roewer I. Lang B.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and tRNA circularization/RT-PCR (35Laforest M-J. Bullerwell C.E. Forget L. Lang B.F. RNA. 2004; 10: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other chytridiomycetes (but not all) have been shown to have this type of tRNA editing (35Laforest M-J. Bullerwell C.E. Forget L. Lang B.F. RNA. 2004; 10: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Editing in S. punctatus is highly similar in effect to that in A. castellanii, a quite unexpected result considering the lack of a specific evolutionary relationship between chytridiomycete fungi and this amoeboid protist. In the present study, we first demonstrate and then examine an enzymatic activity in S. punctatus mitochondrial extracts that incorporates nucleotides into tRNA molecules, an activity that has the properties expected of the in vivo mitochondrial tRNA editing activity. We compare the biochemistry of the S. punctatus and A. castellanii editing activities and discuss how they may have evolved. Culture Conditions and Preparation of Mitochondrial S100 Extracts—S. punctatus strain BR117 was kindly provided by B. F. Lang (Université de Montréal), maintained on agar plates, and grown in a liquid medium containing 0.5% yeast extract and 3% glycerol (adjusted to pH 5.8 with KH2PO4). Cells were grown with hard shaking (∼100 rpm) in 100-ml cultures for ∼48 h until the majority of the culture consisted of zoospores, which were found to be much less resistant to lysis than mature cells. Swimming zoospores were slowed by a 15-min incubation on ice, pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g, and washed two times with 500 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl). Cells from 1 liter of culture (1–3 g of cells were routinely obtained) were mixed with 10 ml of homogenization buffer (0.35 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and re-suspended with a teflon homogenizer. Cells were disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell at 1000 psi. If >80% cell breakage was not observed by microscopy, cells were passed through the cell a second time. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 440 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 1780 × g for a further 10 min. The second supernatant was then centrifuged at 9000 × g for 20 min, yielding a pellet containing intact mitochondria. The supernatant from this centrifugation step was retained for the preparation of cytoplasmic RNA (see below). The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of homogenization buffer, and residual cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 1780 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 9000 × g for 20 min, and the mitochondrial pellet was washed twice by resuspension in 10 ml of homogenization buffer followed by centrifugation at 9000 × g for 20 min. Mitochondria were resuspended in 1 ml of sonication buffer (7.5% glycerol, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted by sonication with a Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator Model 100 at 1/3 maximum power for 3 × 30 s, 1 × 20 s, with 1-min rests between bursts. The sonicate was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a fixed angle rotor, and the supernatant (S100) was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C in 50-μl aliquots. Alternatively, RNA was prepared from purified, intact mitochondria (see below). S100 fractions were active for nucleotide incorporation for more than a year under these conditions. For most experiments, the S100 was incubated on ice for 20 min with 1/5 volume of QAE-Sephadex A-50 strong anion exchange resin (ion exchange group: diethyl-(2-hydroxy-propyl)aminoethyl; stored in sonication buffer) prior to in vitro assays. Preparation of Mitochondrial and Cytoplasmic RNA—Purified mitochondria were gently lysed in a solution containing 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, centrifuged at 9000 × g for 10 min, and nucleic acids were prepared from both the resulting pellet (mito-P) and supernatant (mito-S) fractions. Cytoplasmic RNAs were prepared from the supernatant of the first 9000 × g spin in the protocol for preparation of a mitochondrial S100 fraction (see above). RNA was isolated as described (36Spencer D.F. Schnare M.N. Gray M.W. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis. 4. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 347-360Google Scholar). To assess mitochondrial enrichment, 5 μg of RNA from each fraction was treated with 2.5 units of DNase I for 30 min and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. In Vitro Assay of Nucleotide Incorporation—Each assay contained 2.5 μl of the mitochondrial S100 extract, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.0 with NaOH), 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm NTPs (when included), 10 μCi of [α-32P]NTP (when included), and exogenous tRNA substrate (when included; RNA was either 1 μg of yeast soluble RNA, 1/20 of the product of a T7 transcription reaction, or a small portion of a 32P-end-labeled T7 transcription product). Reactions (in a final volume of 50 μl) were performed at room temperature (∼22 °C) for 1 h (or less, as indicated in the text). Products of in vitro assays were extracted with phenol-cresol and precipitated with ethanol using linear polyacrylamide as carrier (37Gaillard C. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 378Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed through 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea (36Spencer D.F. Schnare M.N. Gray M.W. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis. 4. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 347-360Google Scholar). Preparation of Synthetic tRNA Substrates—Oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in Table I. The A. castellanii mitochondrial tRNALeu(uag) gene cloned into the pT7Blue vector (see Ref. 33Price D.H. Gray M.W. RNA. 1999; 5: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; referred to here as plasmid 1) was used to generate the PCR templates for T7 RNA polymerase transcription, yielding tRNA constructs 1 and 4–9 (see Figs. 3 and 4A for sequences of constructs). The PCR templates for tRNA constructs 2 and 3 were generated by first introducing 5′ or 3′ extensions, respectively, into the cloned tRNALeu in plasmid 1. This was accomplished by PCR using divergently oriented primers, to generate plasmid 2 (using oligonucleotides 1 and 2) and plasmid 3 (using oligonucleotides 3 and 4). PCR amplification was performed with Vent DNA polymerase in all cases. The linearized plasmids 2 and 3 thus produced were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and circularized with T4 DNA ligase. Plasmids 1, 2, and 3 were cloned in competent Escherichia coli cells (strain DH5-α), and plasmid DNA was prepared using an alkaline lysis procedure. The sequence of the tRNALeu region of the plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Fig. 4Incorporation of label from [α-32P]GTP and [α-32P]UTP into in vitro-transcribed tRNA substrates.

Plasmids were treated with the endonuclease HindIII (which cuts outside the tRNALeu region in the multiple cloning site) prior to amplification in order to eliminate longer, unwanted products observed in PCR reactions using uncleaved plasmids. T7 templates for synthesis of tRNA constructs 1–9 were generated using the oligonucleotide combinations shown in Table II. Each T7 template contained a 6-nt 5′-leader, a T7 promoter, and the desired tRNALeu sequence. The products of PCR were extracted with phenol-cresol, precipitated with ethanol, and 1/10 of each product was used as template for each 50 μl of T7 in vitro transcription reaction. Products of in vitro transcription were treated with 2.5 units of DNase I, separated in 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, excised, and eluted. An approximately equal amount of T7 product (several micrograms) was generated for each construct, as estimated by ethidium bromide staining of polyacrylamide gels.Table IIOligonucleotide combinations for PCR generation of T7 templatesT7 template for constructOligonucleotide combination15 (sense), 6 (antisense)27 (sense), 6 (antisense)35 (sense), 8 (antisense)49 (sense), 6 (antisense)510 (sense), 6 (antisense)65 (sense), 11 (antisense)75 (sense), 12 (antisense)89 (sense), 11 (antisense)99 (sense), 12 (antisense) Open table in a new tab End Analysis of RNA—Transfer RNAs labeled by the S100 extract in the presence of [α-32P]GTP were eluted from an homogenized gel slice by shaking overnight at 4 °C in a 1:1 mixture of phenol-cresol:buffer [0.5 m NH4OAc, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1.0 mm EDTA] (36Spencer D.F. Schnare M.N. Gray M.W. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis. 4. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 347-360Google Scholar). Extracted RNAs were precipitated with ethanol and treated with either nuclease P1, which generates nucleoside 5′-phosphates (pN), or RNase T2, which generates nucleoside 3′-phosphates (Np). The products of nuclease P1 digestion were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (predeveloped with distilled H2O and allowed to dry) and 0.5 m (NH4)2 CO3 as the solvent. The products of RNase T2 digestion were separated by TLC on cellulose plates (pre-dipped in a 10-fold dilution of a saturated solution of (NH4)2SO4 and allowed to dry) using a 4:1 mixture of 95% ethanol:water as the solvent (38Lane B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 110-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3′- and 5′-End-labeling and RNA Sequencing—RNAs were 3′-end-labeled with [5′-32P]pCp and RNA ligase (39Peattie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) or dephosphorylated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase and 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (40Schnare M.N. Heinonen T.Y.K. Young P.G. Gray M.W. Curr. Genet. 1985; 9: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Labeled products were purified by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels, excised and eluted. Partial sequences of the 3′- and 5′-portions of 3′- and 5′-end-labeled RNAs were determined by separation of the products of partial alkaline hydrolysis and partial digestion with RNase T1 (which cleaves 3′ to G residues) in adjacent wells of a 20% polyacrylamide gel. Further 3′-end analysis was performed by TLC separation of an RNase T2 digest of 3′-end-labeled material (see above for TLC conditions). Periodate Treatment of RNA—One-twentieth of the RNA product of a T7 transcription reaction or a small portion of a 32P-end-labeled T7 transcription product was dissolved in a 40-μl solution containing 150 mm NaOAc (pH 5.3) and 1 mm NaIO4, incubated on ice in the dark for 1 h, and precipitated with ethanol. Development of an in Vitro Assay of Nucleotide Incorporation—Intact mitochondria were recovered from S. punctatus zoospores by lysis under relatively mild conditions in a French pressure cell followed by differential centrifugation. This procedure resulted in significant mitochondrial enrichment, as estimated by the ratio of mitochondrial to cytoplasmic rRNAs in mitochondrial RNA profiles (Fig. 1). Purified mitochondria were disrupted by sonication, and an S100 fraction was obtained by ultracentrifugation of the sonicate. In order to test for a tRNA editing activity in the S. punctatus S100 fraction, an in vitro assay developed to study A. castellanii 5′-tRNA editing (33Price D.H. Gray M.W. RNA. 1999; 5: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was employed. This assay monitors the incorporation of [α-32P]NTPs into tRNA molecules following incubation with a mitochondrial extract. As in A. castellanii, incubation of the S. punctatus mitochondrial S100 fraction in the presence of [α-32P]GTP resulted in the incorporation of label into tRNAs present in the S100 fraction (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Yeast tRNAs were also found to be substrates for the labeling activity (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Nucleotide incorporation by the S. punctatus mitochondrial S100 fraction was initially observed using the assay conditions optimized for the A. castellanii editing activity (33Price D.H. Gray M.W. RNA. 1999; 5: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Optimal temperature and salt concentration for the S. punctatus activity were subsequently determined (not shown): the activity was found to function equally well from room temperature (∼22 °C) to 37 °C, with reduced activity at 42 °C and loss of activity at 48 °C. Added monovalent cations (in the form of KCl) were not required and did not affect labeling efficiency. Added divalent cation was required, with peak activity at 15 mm MgCl2 and loss of activity at ≥30 mm MgCl2. The results in Fig. 2A were obtained using conditions optimized for the S. punctatus mitochondrial nucleotide incorporation activity. Following optimization, endogenous tRNAs were removed from the S100 by incubation of the extract with QAE-Sephadex A-50 anion exchange resin, rendering this fraction dependent on addition of exogenous tRNA substrates (compare lanes 3 and 4, Fig. 2A). QAE-Sephadex-treated S100 fractions (hereinafter referred to as “the S100 extract”) were used for all subsequent experiments. When a nuclease P1 digest (which generates nucleoside 5′-phosphates, pN) of yeast tRNAs labeled with [α-32P]GTP was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), the majority of the label was found to be incorporated as a nucleoside triphosphate (pppG), with a minority incorporated as a nucleoside monophosphate (pG) (Fig. 2B). This experiment indicated that nucleotide incorporation had occurred both internally (possibly at position 2) and at tRNA 5′-ends. The result also indicated that 5′-ends are left as triphosphates by the activity in vitro, as is also the case for the A. castellanii activity (33Price D.H. Gray M.W. RNA. 1999; 5: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Consistent with incorporation at tRNA positions 1 and 2, TLC analysis of an RNase T2 digest (which generates nucleoside 3′-phosphates, Np) of the same material revealed only a product that did not migrate from the origin (Fig. 2C). Because multiphosphorylated nucleotides are known to migrate little, if at all, from the origin in the TLC conditions used (33Price D.H. Gray M.W. RNA. 1999; 5: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it was possible that this product represented pppGp, the only product expected if all label was incorporated at positions 1 and 2 (Fig. 2D). Based on these results, the activity in the S. punctatus mitochondrial S100 extract was further characterized as a potential tRNA editing activity analogous to that described in A. castellanii. Characterization of Nucleotide Incorporation using in Vitro Transcripts—To examine in more detail the mechanism of nucleotide incorporation into tRNA molecules, in vitro-transcribed tRNA constructs, based on an A. castellanii mitochondrial tRNALeu(uag) scaffold (Fig. 3), were produced using T7 RNA polymerase. Specific sequence changes were engineered into the 5′- and 3′-side of the acceptor stem of this tRNA to create RNA constructs (Fig. 4A) that were then tested as substrates for the S. punctatus nucleotide incorporation activity. Transcripts were incubated with the S. punctatus mitochondrial S100 extract and either [α-32P]GTP or [α-32P]UTP, and the products were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4B). The labeling results shown in Fig. 4B were consistent with the expected positions and identities of incorporated nucleotides (indicated in Fig. 4A). Construct 1 was designed to direct G incorporation at positions 2 and 1 (Fig. 5A), templated by C71 and C72, respectively. Construct 1 was labeled by incubation with the S100 extract in the presence of [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 4B,"
https://openalex.org/W2061322694,"We have recently shown that induction of biglycan (BGN) expression by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) required sequential activation of both Smad and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (Ungefroren, H., Lenschow, W., Chen, W.-B., and Kalthoff, H. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 11041–11049). Here, we have analyzed the receptors through which TGF-β1 controls expression of BGN and GADD45β, the latter of which is postulated to link early Smad signaling to delayed activation of p38. Ectopic expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the TGF-β type II receptor in PANC-1 cells abrogated TGF-β-induced BGN up-regulation. Similarly, inhibition of the TGF-β type I receptor/ALK5 with either SB431542 or by enforced stable expression of a kinasedead mutant greatly attenuated the TGF-β effect on both BGN and GADD45β expression in PANC-1 and MG-63 cells. The enhancing effect of ALK5 on TGF-β-mediated GADD45β and BGN expression and on GADD45β promoter activity was also dependent on its ability to activate Smad signaling, because an ALK5 mutant defective in Smad activation (TβRImL45) but with an otherwise functional kinase domain failed to mediate these responses. The TGF-β/ALK5 effect on p38 activation and BGN expression was mimicked by overexpression of GADD45β alone (in the absence of TGF-β stimulation) and suppressed upon antisense inhibition of GADD45β expression. These results show that TGF-β induces BGN expression through (the Smad-activating function of) ALK5 and GADD45β and suggest that the sensitivity of MyD118 to activation by TGF-β, which varies between tissues, ultimately determines the strength of the TGF-β effect on BGN. We have recently shown that induction of biglycan (BGN) expression by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) required sequential activation of both Smad and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (Ungefroren, H., Lenschow, W., Chen, W.-B., and Kalthoff, H.

Most, if not all, of the cellular activities of TGF-β are mediated by specific receptor complexes that are assembled upon ligand binding and comprise the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) and a type I receptor (4Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4291) Google Scholar). Whereas only one type II receptor is known so far, there are at least three type I receptors, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)1/TSR-1 (5ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Franzen P. Schulz P. Saras J.

ALK5 has an ubiquitous distribution and represents the principle type I receptor that mediates most cellular responses to TGF-β. The activated ligand-receptor complex activates one or more downstream signaling pathways, the most prominent one being the Smad pathway (1Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S.

However, other signaling pathways can be activated by the ALK5 kinase, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ERK1/2 (8Ellenrieder V. Hendler S.F. Boeck W. Seufferlein T. Menke A. Ruhland C. Adler G. Gress T.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4222-4228PubMed Google Scholar), and p38 MAPK (9Bakin A.V. Rinehart C. Tomlinson A.K. Arteaga C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3139-3206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of p38 signaling the activation by ALK5 may be Smad-independent (10Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) or Smad-dependent (4Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4291) Google Scholar, 11Itoh S.

Recently, transcriptional induction by TGF-β of GADD45β (encoded by MyD118), a protein involved in the response to genotoxic stress (12Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), has been shown to be Smad-dependent and to mediate the (delayed) activation of p38 by TGF-β (13Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L.

However, although GADD45β has been identified as a positive modulator of TGF-β-induced apoptosis (Ref. 12Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and references therein), its role in other major TGF-β responses, e.g. matrix gene expression is less clear. Biglycan (BGN) belongs to the family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans and is functionally involved in matrix assembly, cellular migration, and the regulation of growth factor, e.g. TGF-β activity (reviewed in Refs. 16Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar and 17Kinsella M.G. Bressler S.L. Wight T.N. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2004; 14: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). BGN is a major constituent of the bone matrix where it is synthesized by osteoblasts, and studies in BGN-deficient mice indicated a crucial role for this proteoglycan in bone metabolism and mechanical properties (18Young M.F.

BGN is markedly up-regulated in fibrotic lesions of lung (20Westergren-Thorsson G. Hernnas J. Sarnstrand B. Oldberg A. Heinegard D. Malmstrom A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), of hepatic (21Gressner A.M. Krull N. Bachem M.G. Pathol. Res.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44173-44178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and in the stroma of solid tumors, e.g. pancreatic carcinoma (24Weber C.K. Sommer G. Michl P. Fensterer H. Weimer M. Gansauge F. Leder G. Adler G. Gress T.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These compartments, like the bone matrix, are highly enriched in TGF-β. This correlation is not accidental, because BGN is exceptionally sensitive to induction by TGF-β and as such can serve as a marker of fibrotic tissue deposition in the stroma (23Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Corpuz L. Roth M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44173-44178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, BGN-producing cells differ in their BGN response to TGF-β stimulation, e.g. osteoblastic MG-63 cells increase BGN expression only moderately by 2- to 3-fold, whereas pancreatic PANC-1 cells respond to TGF-β under the same conditions with a 10-fold stronger induction (24Weber C.K. Sommer G. Michl P. Fensterer H. Weimer M. Gansauge F. Leder G. Adler G. Gress T.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Chen W-B.

Previous studies from our group indicated that in both pancreatic and bone cells the TGF-β-induced rise in cytoplasmic BGN mRNA involves an as yet undefined nuclear post-transcriptional mechanism rather than an increase in transcriptional activity of the BGN gene promoter (25Chen W-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Ungefroren H. Krull N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15787-15795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, at present it is unknown if the greater inducibility of BGN by TGF-β in (pancreatic) epithelial versus mesenchymal cells resides in qualitative and/or quantitative differences in receptor-proximal signaling, or at the transcriptional/post-transcriptional level. TGF-β signaling to BGN has revealed an unexpected degree of complexity. The TGF-β effect on BGN is strictly dependent on activation of Smads (25Chen W-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and p38 (27Ungefroren H. Lenschow W. Chen W.B. Faendrich F. Kalthoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11041-11049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The delayed kinetics of both p38 activation and BGN up-regulation and the sensitivity of the TGF-β effect on BGN to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (25Chen W-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) suggested an indirect effect involving early Smad-mediated transcriptional activation of a gene X, which subsequently activates p38 and finally BGN. These findings further predict that signaling intermediates crucial for TGF-β activation of p38 are likely to be important for TGF-β regulation of BGN, too. As part of a larger project aimed at characterizing the “missing links” in the series of signaling events commencing with the activation of TGF-β receptors and culminating in BGN mRNA accumulation, we initially focused on the role of ALK5 and its functional domains, respectively, responsible for transducing the TGF-β signal to BGN. We present evidence that induction of both GADD45β and BGN expression as well as activation of p38 by TGF-β requires the Smad-activating function of ALK5. We further show that intermittent activation of GADD45β expression is mandatory for TGF-β/ALK5 regulation of p38 activation and BGN induction. The results of this study establish the ALK5-GADD45β-p38 pathway to be crucial for TGF-β regulation of BGN and provide for the first time data on the regulation of GADD45β expression by the ALK5 kinase. Antibodies and Reagents—TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany). Antibodies to TβRII (l-21), ALK5 (V-22), and GADD45β (N-20) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, to phospho-p38, p38, and phospho-Smad2 from Cell Signaling Technology (Heidelberg, Germany), to Smad2 from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (Berlin, Germany), to β-actin and FLAG (M2) from Sigma, and to HA (clone 12CA5) from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). SB431542 was purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Pharmacological inhibitors were added to cells 30–60 min before the addition of TGF-β, which was used at a concentration of 5 ng/ml in all experiments. All other reagents used were of analytical grade purity. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 and osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were maintained as described earlier (26Ungefroren H. Krull N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15787-15795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Ungefroren H. Lenschow W. Chen W.B. Faendrich F. Kalthoff H. J. Biol.

Löhr (University of Mannheim) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells stably transduced with various retroviral vectors were cultured in the presence of 700 (PANC-1) or 250 (MG-63) μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from PANC-1 and MG-63 cells was isolated with peqGOLD RNAPure (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). The general RT-PCR protocol, the conditions for competitive quantitative PCR, the PCR primer sequences for BGN and plasminogen activator-inhibitor (PAI-1), as well as the procedure of data analysis were described in detail earlier (25Chen W-B.

Sense-strand-specific amplification and quantification of GADD45β expression was achieved using primers GADD45β-forward (AACATGACGCTGGAAGAGCTCG) and GADD-45β-3′-UTR-reverse (ACAGATTCTGCTGCTGGGAAGG), together with a standard fragment lacking nucleotides 120–187 of the human GADD45β cDNA (GenBank™ accession: NM_015675). Amplification of β-actin-specific transcripts was carried out with β-actin-forward (GACGAGGCCCAGAGCAAGAG) and β-actin-reverse (ATCTCCTTCTGCATCCTGTC) primers. All values for GADD45β, BGN, and PAI-1 mRNA concentrations were normalized to those for β-actin in the same sample to account for small differences in cDNA input. Construction of Vectors and Retroviral Infection—The entire open reading frame of human GADD45β was amplified by RT-PCR with Turbo Pfu polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers GADD45β-forward (see above) and GADD45β-reverse (CTCAGCGTTCCTGAAGAGAGATG, stop codon underlined) and was subcloned in both sense and antisense orientation into the retroviral vector TJBA5bMoLink-neo (TJ-neo) (25Chen W-B.

A cDNA for rat FLAG-TβRImL45(T202D) (10Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) was excised from pRK5F and inserted into TJ-neo and pcDNA3-HASL. cDNA inserts of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged versions of dnTβRII (D404G), caALK5 (T204D), and kdALK5 (K232R), were excised from pcDNA1, pCMV5, or pcDNA3-HASL, respectively, and inserted into TJ-neo. Positive clones (evaluated by PCR, restriction analysis, and sequencing of the plasmid-cDNA junctions) were co-transfected into HEK293T producer cells along with retroviral packaging vectors as described previously (25Chen W-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Retroviral particles released by 293T cells were used to infect PANC-1 and MG-63 cells. Pools and individual clones of productively infected cells were obtained after selection with Geneticin. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—For transient transfections followed by immunoprecipitation (IP), cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 on day 1 in 10-cm plates, and on day 2 they were co-transfected serum-free with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with either FLAG-p38 or FLAG-Smad2 in combination with empty pcDNA3 vector, caALK5, or caTβRImL45 as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. Following removal of the transfection solution and a recovery period of 24 h in normal growth medium, cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 for 1 h. The transfected cells were then lysed in IP buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and processed for anti-FLAG and anti-HA immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (see below). For reporter gene assays, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and were cotransfected on the next day serum-free with Lipofectamine Plus (PANC-1) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (MG-63) according to the manufacturer's instructions with various cDNAs (in pcDNA3) at an equal molar ratio together with p6SBE-Luc (28Dai J.L. Turnacioglu K.K. Schutte M. Sugar A.Y. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4592-4597PubMed Google Scholar), or pG45β-1 (29Major M.B. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 5278-5287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the Renilla luciferase-encoding vector pRL-TK (Promega). Each well received the same total amount of DNA, and empty vector was added as needed. Following transfection and TGF-β1 stimulation, luciferase activities were determined with the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega). In all reporter gene assays the data were derived from 6–8 wells processed in parallel and corrected for transfection efficiency with Renilla luciferase activity. Immunoblot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates using protein G Plus-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the protocol provided by the supplier and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting as described in detail earlier (25Chen W-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). TβRII Function Is Required for TGF-β Induction of BGN Expression—To assess the role of TβRII for TGF-β-induced BGN expression, we measured TGF-β-stimulated BGN expression in SW48, a colon carcinoma cell line harboring a loss-offunction mutation in TβRII as a result of a mismatch repair deficiency with microsatellite instability (30Vincent F. Nagashima M. Takenoshita S. Khan M.A. Gemma A. Hagiwara K. Bennett W.P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These cells failed to up-regulate BGN mRNA after a 24-h treatment with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Fig. 1A). Prolonged treatment with or higher concentrations of this growth factor were also ineffective in inducing BGN expression (data not shown). Under the same conditions, TGF-β-responsive PANC-1 cells responded with a 20-fold induction of BGN mRNA over basal levels (Fig. 1A). To further probe the role of TβRII in TGF-β regulation of BGN, we retrovirally transduced PANC-1 cells in a stable fashion with a TβRII mutant (TβRII-D404G). This mutant has been shown to act in a dominant negative fashion by inhibiting the appearance of wild type receptor at the cell surface (31Knaus P.I. Lindemann D. DeCoteau J.F. Perlman R. Yankelev H. Hille M. Kadin M.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3480-3489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A clone pool (heterogenous mixture of G418-resistant cells with respect to integration site and expression level of the transgene) displayed strong expression of the mutant as revealed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). Notably, TGF-β-induced expression of BGN and of PAI-1, another TGF-β response gene dependent on Smad, but independent of p38 activation (25Chen W-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was completely suppressed (Fig. 1, C and D). These data indicate that TβRII is required for BGN induction by TGF-β in gastrointestinal epithelial cells. The ALK5 Kinase Activity Is Required for p38 Activation and BGN Induction—Next, we tested whether ALK5 is involved in TGF-β induction of BGN and treated PANC-1 cells with SB431542, a novel imidazole compound with selectivity for the ALK5 group of TGF-β/BMP type I receptors (ALK5, ALK4, and ALK7) (32Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). This inhibitor effectively suppressed the BGN response to TGF-β in both PANC-1 (Fig. 2A) and MG-63 cells (data not shown). To more specifically inhibit ALK5, we expressed in PANC-1 and MG-63 cells by stable retroviral transduction a kinase-deficient ALK5 mutant (kdALK5) known to act in a dominant negative fashion. The mutant protein was strongly expressed in the PANC-1 transductants (Fig. 2B, upper panel) and was functional, because TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 was markedly attenuated in kdALK5-expressing cells but not in the corresponding vector-transduced control cells (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, ectopic expression of kdALK5 also blocked phosphorylation, and thus activation, of p38 MAPK (Fig. 2B). In agreement with the results from the pharmacological inhibition, BGN mRNA was markedly reduced in both kdALK5-expressing PANC-1 (Fig. 2C) and MG-63 cells (Fig. 2D). The data clearly indicate that the ALK5 kinase activity is crucial for TGF-β regulation of BGN in both pancreatic and bone cells. p38 MAPK Activation and BGN Up-regulation by TGF-β Requires the Smad-activating Function of ALK5—Previous data indicated that an early activation of the Smad pathway was required for and preceded the activation of p38 and BGN expression by TGF-β (14Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 25Chen W-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11041-11049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that, besides the kinase activity, the Smad-activating function of ALK5 is also important. To confirm this directly on the receptor level, we employed an ALK5-derived mutant (TβRImL45) that has retained a functional kinase domain but due to additional mutations in the L45 loop was unable to activate Smads (10Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). To avoid activation of the endogenous receptors we used the constitutively active (ca) counterparts ALK5-TD (33Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massaguè J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) and TβRImL45(TD) (10Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). As expected, co-transfection of PANC-1 cells with HA-tagged caALK5 or HA-tagged caTβRImL45 along with FLAG-tagged Smad2 or FLAG-tagged p38 followed by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation and anti-Smad or anti-p38 immunoblotting, respectively, revealed that caALK5, but not caTβRImL45, phosphorylated Smad2 and p38 (Fig. 3A). Next, we verified the inability of caTβRImL45 to activate the Smad pathway in a transcriptional reporter assay using the Smad-specific reporter plasmid p6SBE-Luc. Transcriptional induction of p6SBE-Luc by this mutant was weak in comparison to that of caALK5 (Fig. 3B). Finally, BGN mRNA levels in (unstimulated) MG-63 cells stably expressing caALK5 approached those in TGF-β-treated control cells, whereas they remained below basal levels in their caTβRImL45-expressing counterparts (Fig. 3C), despite approximately equal expression of the mutant proteins (not shown). Very similar results with respect to BGN expression were obtained with PANC-1 cells ectopically expressing caALK5 or caTβRImL45 (data not shown; these cells were also used for analysis of TGF-β/ALK5 regulation of GADD45β expression, see Fig. 4C). These data strongly support the assumption that the Smad-activating function of ALK5 accounts for most, if not all, of p38 activity, which is consistent with the delayed type of p38 activation seen in both cell types following ligand stimulation (14Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Ungefroren H. Lenschow W. Chen W.B. Faendrich F. Kalthoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11041-11049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D). Given the strict dependence of TGF-β regulation of BGN on p38 activation, we hypothesized that the comparatively low induction of BGN expression by TGF-β in MG-63 cells (2.5-fold versus 20-fold in PANC-1) is the result of a lower activation of p38. To this end, TGF-β induced p38 phosphorylation in MG-63 with similar (delayed) kinetics, but the extent was much weaker (Fig. 3D) than in PANC-1 cells (see vector control in Fig. 2B). This observation further suggests that signaling events upstream of p38 activation ultimately determine the magnitude of the BGN response to TGF-β. TGF-β Induces GADD45β Expression via ALK5—The Smad-mediated induction of GADD45β expression has been shown to trigger activation of the p38 pathway by TGF-β in PANC-1 and other cell types (14Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, TGF-β induced a robust increase of GADD45β mRNA in PANC-1 cells within 1 h of stimulation (Fig. 4A). Induction of GADD45β by TGF-β was also observed in MG-63 cells, albeit to a lesser extent and corresponded with a lower overall increase (compared with PANC-1) in both p38 activation (see Fig. 3D) and BGN expression (see Fig. 3C). Next, we tested the assumption that GADD45β induction by TGF-β was mediated by ALK5. As expected, PANC-1 cells treated with SB431542 failed to activate GADD45β in response to TGF-β (Fig. 4B). We then evaluated the possibility that the inability of caTβRImL45 to activate p38 and to induce BGN mRNA (see Fig. 3) was due to its failure to induce transcription from MyD118. To this end, GADD45β mRNA levels were elevated strongly in PANC-1 cells stably expressing caALK5, but not in PANC-1 cells stably expressing caTβRImL45 (Fig. 4C). To test in a more direct fashion whether ALK5 can transcriptionally activate MyD118, we monitored caALK5-mediated activation of G45β-1, a transcriptional reporter containing ∼1500 bp of 5′-flanking region from the human GADD45β gene in front of the luciferase gene (29Major M.B. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 5278-5287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), in MG-63 cells. Notably, caALK5, but not caTβRImL45, induced G45β-1 186.7 ± 15.6% over vector controls (Fig. 4D). It should be mentioned that under similar conditions PANC-1 cells were unresponsive to this promoter constru"

Previously, we have demonstrated that STAT-3-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) expression is needed for VSMC motility induced by platelet-derived growth factor-BB, a receptor tyrosine kinase agonist (Neeli et al. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 46122–46128). In order to learn more about the STAT-3-cPLA2 axis in motogenic signaling, here we have studied its role in VSMC motility in response to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonist, thrombin. Thrombin induced VSMC motility in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 0.5 units/ml. Thrombin activated STAT-3 as measured by its tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Forced expression of a dominant negative mutant of STAT-3 reduced thrombin-induced STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Thrombin stimulated STAT-3-DNA binding and reporter gene activities in VSMC, and these responses were blocked by FS3DM, a dominant negative mutant of STAT-3. FS3DM also attenuated thrombin-induced VSMC motility. Thrombin induced the expression of cPLA2 in a time- and STAT-3-dependent manner. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of cPLA2 blocked thrombin-induced VSMC motility. Furthermore, exogenous addition of arachidonic acid rescued thrombin-induced VSMC motility from inhibition by blockade of STAT-3 activation. Forced expression of cPLA2 also surpassed the inhibitory effect of dominant negative STAT-3 on thrombin-induced VSMC motility. Together, these results show that thrombin-induced VSMC motility requires STAT-3-dependent induction of expression of cPLA2.

The dysfunctional endothelial cells and inflammatory cells at the site of vascular injury produce a large number of molecules with a broad spectrum of biological activities (1Ross R. N. Engl. J.

Thus, the availability of these substances at the site of vascular injury provides a permissive milieu for VSMC dedifferentiation (9Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The dedifferentiated VSMC acquire their embryonic synthetic noncontractile phenotype and contribute to the progression of lesions such as restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty via their migration from media to intima and multiplication in intima (10Regan C.P. Adam P.J. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported that inhibition of expression of molecules that are produced at the site of vascular injury or suppression of their biological activities ameliorates the lesion progression (11Ferns G.A.

As several molecules are involved in the pathogenesis of arterial wall lesions, identifying the signaling mechanisms that are common to many such factors may eventually lead to the development of better therapeutic agents against these vascular diseases. Janus-activated kinases are a group of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that, via tyrosine phosphorylation, modulate the activities of a group of transcriptional factors, namely signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) (13Darnell Jr., J.E.

A body of accumulating evidence indicates that STATs play an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (15Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yoshida Y. Shirogane T. Nishida K.

Upon release, it is either metabolized via the cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, or cytochrome P450 monooxygenase pathways producing prostaglandins, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, respectively, or is reincorporated into membrane phospholipids via esterification involving arachidonoyl-CoA synthase and arachidonoyl-lysophospholipid transferase (18Piomelli D.

To gain insight into the motogenic signaling events of GPCR agonists, here we have studied the role of STAT-3 in thrombin-induced VSMC migration. The major finding of the present study is that thrombin induces VSMC motility via activation of STAT-3 targeting the induction of expression of cPLA2. Reagents—Aprotinin, dithiothreitol, HEPES, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, sodium deoxycholate, leupeptin, and thrombin were purchased from Sigma. Arachidonic acid was bought from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Phospho-specific anti-STAT-3 (9131S) antibodies were procured from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-cPLA2 antibodies (SC-454), anti-p53 antibodies (SC-6243), anti-STAT-3 antibodies (SC-482), and consensus STAT-3 binding oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTAGATC-3′ and 3′-CTAGGAAGACCCTTAAGGATCTAG-5′) (SC-2571) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Construction of pFS3DM, a dominant negative STAT-3 plasmid, and pcDNA3-cPLA2, a cPLA2 expression plasmid, were described previously (17Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were quiesced by incubating in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum for 72 h and used to perform the experiments unless otherwise stated. Cell Motility—VSMC motility was measured by cell wounding assay (49Zhuang D. Ceacareanu A.C. Lin Y. Ceacareanu B. Dixit M. Chapman K.E. Waters C.M. Rao G.N. Hassid A. Am. J.

Quiescent confluent monolayers of VSMC were wounded with a sterile pipette tip to generate a cell-free gap of ∼1 mm width, and the wound location in the culture dish was marked. Cells were washed, and fresh serum-free DMEM was added and photographed to record the wound width at 0 h. To prevent replicative DNA synthesis, hydroxyurea was added to the medium to a final concentration of 5 mm just before the addition of agonist. Twenty four hours after the appropriate treatments, photographs were taken again at the marked wound location. Cell migration was measured using the NIH image 1.62 program, and the cell motility was expressed as distance migrated in micrometer units. To test the effect of dominant negative mutant of STAT-3 on thrombin-induced motility, cells were first transfected with FS3DM or an empty vector for 48 h and quiesced before they were subjected to agonist-induced motility. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from treated or untreated VSMC as described previously (39Yellaturu C.R. Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The protein content of the nuclear extracts was determined by using a Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce). Protein-DNA complexes were formed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 20 μl consisting of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15% glycerol, and 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 30 min on ice. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel using 1× Tris-glycine/EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm glycine, 0.1 mm EDTA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 polynucleotide kinase kit (Promega) following the supplier's protocol. Northern Blot Analysis—After appropriate treatments, total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). An equal amount of total cellular RNA (20 μg) from control and treated cells was size-fractionated on 1% agarose gel in 25 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 2% formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and cross-linked to the membrane using ultraviolet irradiation (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The 2.1-kb rat cPLA2 cDNA fragment isolated by digestion of pcDNA3-cPLA2 expression plasmid with EcoRI was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). After a 4-h prehybridization in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 250 μg/ml of sheared salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C, the Nytran membrane was hybridized in the above buffer containing 10% dextran sulfate and 1 × 106 cpm/ml of rat cPLA2 cDNA probe for 16 h at 42 °C. The Nytran membrane was washed three times for 15 min each at room temperature in 2× SSC containing 0.2% SDS and two times for 30 min each at 60 °C in 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS. The membrane was exposed to an x-ray film (Hawkins X-Ray film) with an intensifying screen at -80 °C for 2 days. The membrane was re-probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled 18 S rDNA probe for lane loading control. Densitometric analysis of autoradiograms exposed in the linear range of film density was made using the NIH image 1.62 program. Western Blot Analysis—After appropriate treatments, VSMC were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) on ice for 20 min. The cell lysates were scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts containing an equal amount of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by using a chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). Transient Transfection and CAT Assay—VSMC were plated evenly onto 100-mm dishes and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At 50–80% confluence, medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum, and cells were transfected with pSIE-CAT plasmid using Lipofectamine plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Thirty hours after transfection, VSMC were treated with and without thrombin (0.5 units/ml) for the indicated times, and cell extracts were prepared. Wherever the effect of dominant negative STAT-3 mutant was tested on agonist-induced CAT activity, cells were co-transfected with pSIE-CAT along with and without FS3DM or empty vector plasmid DNA. VSMC extracts were normalized for protein and assayed for CAT activity using [14C]chloramphenicol and acetyl coenzyme A as substrates. The substrate and products were extracted with ethyl acetate, separated by TLC, and subjected to autoradiography. Statistics—All the experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. The treatment effects were analyzed by Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. In the case of CAT activity, EMSA, Northern blotting, and Western blotting, one representative set of data is shown. To understand the motogenic signaling events of thrombin, we first determined its dose-response effect on VSMC motility. A cell-free gap was generated in a monolayer of quiescent VSMC as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were then treated with and without various doses of thrombin for 24 h, and cell motility was measured. As shown in Fig. 1, thrombin induced VSMC motility in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum VSMC motility was observed in response to 0.5 units/ml of thrombin. To test the role of STATs in GPCR agonist-induced VSMC motility, we tested the effect of thrombin on STAT-3 activation. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without thrombin (0.5 units/ml) for various times, and cell extracts were prepared. An equal amount of protein from control and each treatment was analyzed by Western blotting for tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 using its phospho-specific antibodies. Thrombin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 in a time-dependent manner with a maximum effect of about 4-fold increase at 10 min and reaching basal levels by 60 min (Fig. 2). To find whether thrombin-induced STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation leads to its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, quiescent VSMC were treated with and without thrombin (0.5 units/ml) for 10 min, and the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared. An equal amount of protein from the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of control and thrombin-treated cells was analyzed by Western blotting for tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 as described above. First, the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-3 was found to be higher in the nuclear fraction than in the cytoplasmic fraction of both control and thrombin-treated cells (Fig. 3). Second, the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-3 in the nuclear fraction of thrombin-treated cells was at least 2-fold higher than its amount in the nuclear fraction of control cells (Fig. 3). In addition, forced expression of FS3DM, a dominant negative mutant of STAT-3, reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in both thrombin-treated and untreated cells. Furthermore, and as expected, in cells transfected with FS3DM, the total amount of STAT-3 was found to be 2-fold higher than in nontransfected cells. The total STAT-3 levels were found to be much lower in nuclear fractions as compared with cytoplasmic fractions, and these levels correlated with the amounts of its phosphorylated form. The relative purity of nuclear preparations was confirmed by re-probing these Western blots for p53 using its specific antibodies. As evident from Fig. 3, p53 was detected only in the nuclear but not in the cytoplasmic fractions.Fig. 2Thrombin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 in a time-dependent manner in VSMC. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without thrombin (0.5 units/ml) for the indicated times, and cell extracts were prepared. An equal amount of protein from control and each treatment was analyzed by Western blotting for pSTAT-3 using its phospho-specific antibodies. As a lane loading control, the blot was re-probed with anti-STAT-3 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3FS3DM, a dominant negative STAT-3 mutant, suppresses thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Quiescent VSMC that were transfected with and without FS3DM or an empty vector were quiesced and treated with and without thrombin (0.5 units/ml) for 10 min, and the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared. An equal amount of protein from the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of VSMC that were subjected to various treatments or left untreated was analyzed by Western blotting for pSTAT-3 using its phospho-specific antibodies.

To find whether the increases in its tyrosine phosphorylation correlate with its transcriptional activation, the STAT-3-DNA binding activity was measured. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without thrombin (0.5 units/ml) for the indicated times, and nuclear extracts were prepared. An equal amount of nuclear protein from control and each treatment was analyzed by EMSA for STAT-3-DNA binding activity using 32P-labeled consensus STAT-3-DNA binding oligonucleotide as a probe. Thrombin increased STAT3-DNA binding activity in a time-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 4 h (Fig. 4A). To confirm that the increased STAT-3-DNA binding activity leads to an increase in its transactivation activity, VSMC were transiently transfected with a STAT-3-dependent reporter plasmid, pSIE-CAT, quiesced, and treated with and without thrombin (0.5 units/ml) for the indicated times, and cell extracts were prepared. Cell extracts normalized for protein were assayed for CAT activity. Consistent with its"
https://openalex.org/W2121208974,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a family of diseases characterized by defects of N-linked glycosylation. In CDG-I, several genetic defects cause a shortage of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which leads to underglycosylation of nascent glycoproteins. N-linked glycosylation is important for proper folding and trafficking of glycoproteins. Inhibition of glycosylation results in the buildup of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, which induces a protective reaction known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). To investigate whether UPR components are induced in CDG, we have performed a transcriptome analysis of primary fibroblasts from unaffected control subjects and from CDG-I patients using oligonucleotide gene expression arrays. The stress imposed by CDG was also compared with the stress induced by tunicamycin and glucose deprivation. Whereas tunicamycin elicited a strong transcriptional response typical for the UPR, CDG fibroblasts displayed a qualitatively similar yet moderate induction of genes encoding components of the UPR. Among these genes, the PERK kinase inhibitor DNAJC3/P58(IPK) gene showed the highest induction throughout all CDG-I types tested. This was paralleled by elevated expression of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport, which defined a new component of the cellular response to glycosylation stress."
https://openalex.org/W2138099449,"We have investigated the expression of c-fos in cervical carcinoma cells and in somatic cell hybrids derived therefrom. In malignant cells, c-fos was constitutively expressed even after serum starvation. Dissection of the c-fos promoter showed that expression was mainly controlled by the SRE motif, which was active in malignant cells, but repressed in their non-malignant counterparts. Constitutive SRE activity was not mediated by sustained mitogen-activated protein kinase activity but because of inefficient expression of the ternary complex factor Net, which was either very low or even barely discernible. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Net directly binds to the SRE nucleoprotein complex in non-tumorigenic cells, but not in malignant segregants. Small interfering RNA targeted against Net resulted in enhanced c-fos transcription, clearly illustrating its repressor function. Conversely, stable ectopic expression of Net in malignant cells negatively regulated endogenous c-fos, resulting in a disappearance of the c-Fos protein from the AP-1 transcription complex. These data indicate that loss of Net and constitutive c-fos expression appear to be a key event in the transformation of cervical cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2053069642,"The prion diseases result from the generation and propagation of an abnormal conformer of the prion protein. It is unclear how this molecular event disrupts neuronal function and viability. Current evidence argues it is not due to loss of normal prion protein activity or direct toxic effects of the abnormal conformer. Both the normal and abnormal prion proteins are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane proteins. Conversion to the abnormal isoform results in the formation and accumulation of prion protein aggregates. Because aggregation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins activates Src-family kinases, the activation status and levels of the Src-family kinases in prion disease were investigated. Elevations of Src-family kinases were found in a cell culture model and two separate animal models of prion disease. The elevations in Src kinases preceded the onset of symptoms and occurred concurrently with the appearance of detergent-insoluble prion protein. In addition, the total level of kinases phosphorylated at tyrosine residues associated with activation was increased. Similar alterations were not present in brain homogenates from presymptomatic animals early in the disease course, prion protein-ablated animals, or end-stage Tg2576 mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein. Identification of similar elevations in cell culture and animal model systems suggests the elevations are a specific response to the presence of the disease-associated conformer.

Abnormal regulation of these signal transduction cascades may be a key element in the cellular pathology of the prion diseases. The past decades have seen the identification and characterization of the controversial etiologic agent of the prion diseases; however, the mechanism underlying these diseases remains unknown. The current report presents the first evidence that prions are associated with increases in the levels of total and activated Src-family kinases. The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Staussler-Scheinker disease, and fatal familial insomnia of humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy of cattle, and naturally occurring scrapie of sheep and goats. Scrapie in rodents is the commonly used model system for the study of these disorders. By light microscopy, these diseases are characterized by neuronal loss, astrogliosis, vacuolar degeneration, and variable degrees of amyloid plaque formation (1DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 785-811PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrastructural examination has shown vacuolar degeneration results from synaptic deterioration, cytoskeletal disruption, membrane dissolution, and membrane fusion (2Kim J.H. Manuelidis E.E. Acta Neuropathol. 1986; 69: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Quantitative studies suggest a progression from synaptic loss to neuritic degeneration and neuronal death (3Jeffrey M. Halliday W.G. Bell J. Johnston A.R. MacLeod N.K. Ingham C. Sayers A.R. Brown D.A. Fraser J.R. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2000; 26: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A wealth of data indicate these diseases are due to prions (4Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Prions are self-propagating proteinaceous infectious particles composed of an abnormal conformer of a normally expressed protein known as the prion protein (PrP). 1The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; PrPSc, PrPScrapie; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; SFK, Src-family kinase; RML, Rocky Mountain Laboratory; ANOVA, analysis of variance; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; PrPC, PrpCellular; Prpo/o, prion protein ablated; APP, amyloid precursor protein. PrP typically exists as a normal cellular conformer (PrPC), whereas a β-sheet enriched, disease-associated form is referred to as PrPScrapie (PrPSc). Recently, Legname et al. (5Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.O. Riesner D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 2004; : 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) generated infectious prions using recombinant prion protein, adding further support to this hypothesis. The normal function of PrPC is unknown; it may participate in synaptic structure (6Collinge J. Whittington M.A. Sidle K.C. Smith C.J. Palmer M.S. Clarke A.R. Jefferys J.G. Nature. 1994; 370: 295-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), neurite formation (7Graner E. Mercadante A.F. Zanata S.M. Forlenza O.V. Cabral A.L. Veiga S.S. Juliano M.A. Roesler R. Walz R.

Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). PrPSc is produced by the conformational conversion of pre-existing PrPC to the abnormal isoform. PrPSc uniformly aggregates, is insoluble in detergents, and tends to be resistant to proteolytic degradation (4Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Formation of PrPSc is the initiating step in prion disease pathogenesis. Experimental inoculation of animals with prions results in the appearance of PrPSc before the development of symptoms and the colocalization of PrPSc with the pathologic lesions (10Hecker R. Taraboulos A. Scott M. Pan K.M. Yang S.L. Torchia M. Jendroska K. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1213-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 11Jeffrey M. Martin S. Barr J. Chong A. Fraser J.R. J. Comp. Pathol. 2001; 124: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that loss of normal PrPC function or, alternatively, direct toxic effects of PrPSc are responsible for the development of disease. Loss of PrPC seems unlikely to be the principal biochemical lesion because prion protein-ablated mice (PrPo/o) fail to develop scrapie (12Sakaguchi S. Katamine S. Shigematsu K. Nakatani A.

Nature. 1992; 356: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar), and furthermore, one recent publication suggests total PrPC levels may increase during the disease process (15Tatzelt J. Groth D.F. Torchia M. Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 1244-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The toxic impact of PrPSc also remains unclear. Conversion to PrPSc has been reported to alter PrP metal binding and antioxidant activity (16Wong B.S. Chen S.G. Colucci M. Xie Z. Pan T. Liu T. Li R. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Brown D.R. J.

DeArmond S.J. Neurology. 1996; 47: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, PrPSc and a fragment of PrP spanning region 106–126 have been reported to be cytotoxic to cells in culture (19Schroder H.C. Perovic S. Kavsan V. Ushijima H. Muller W.E. Neurotoxicology. 1998; 19: 683-688PubMed Google Scholar, 20Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, inoculation of PrPo/o mice with PrPSc results in neither the clinical nor pathologic changes of scrapie, whereas the neuropathologic changes of prion disease and PrPSc formation were restricted to regions of PrP-expressing tissues in brain transplantation studies (12Sakaguchi S. Katamine S. Shigematsu K. Nakatani A. Moriuchi R. Nishida N. Kurokawa K. Nakaoke R. Sato H. Jishage K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Prusiner S.B. Groth D. Serban A.

Together, these findings suggest that in situ conversion of endogenous PrPC to PrPSc per se may be essential to the pathologic process. A number of features suggest an alternative mechanism linking PrPSc formation to the development of disease. We have shown previously (23Vey M. Pilkuhn S. Wille H. Nixon R. DeArmond S.J. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14945-14949Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) that PrPC and PrPSc are glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane proteins present on the external plasma membrane surface. Although the mechanism remains to be clearly defined, it is well recognized that aggregation of GPI-linked proteins, including PrPC, activates Src-family kinases (SFKs) (9Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 24Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev.

The SFKs have diverse roles ranging from control of cytoskeletal elements to regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis (26Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar), and they have been implicated in synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration (27Salter M.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Williamson R. Scales T. Clark B.R. Gibb G. Reynolds C.H. Kellie S. Bird I.N. Varndell I.M. Sheppard P.W. Everall I. Anderton B.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GPI-linked proteins, the SFKs, and a variety of other proteins are localized to cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-enriched membrane microdomains known generically as “rafts,” and specifically, PrPC and Src have been colocalized to the same raft compartments (24Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar, 26Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar, 29Morel E. Fouquet S. Chateau D. Yvernault L. Frobert Y. Pincon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. Pillot T. Rousset M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1499-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As such, the inherent property of PrPSc to form aggregates could result in the unregulated activation of these kinases. In addition, PrPSc has a prolonged half-life (30Borchelt D.R. Scott M. Taraboulos A. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), thus persistence of PrPSc aggregates may affect the levels of the SFKs. The impact of PrPSc on SFK levels and activation was therefore examined in three distinct models of prion diseases. These studies reveal elevations in multiple SFKs and demonstrate increased levels of phosphotyrosine residues associated with SFK activation. The proximate role of the SFKs in multiple diverse cellular signaling cascades suggests that dysregulation of these molecules could have profound pathologic consequences. Animals—Tg2866(MoPrP-P101L)PrPo/o mice were generously provided by Dr. Stanley Prusiner (University of California San Francisco) (31Telling G.C. Haga T. Torchia M. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1736-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These mice carry a proline to leucine mutation at position 101 of mouse PrP, the mouse equivalent of the PrP mutation causing the familial human prion disease Gerstmann-Staussler-Scheinker disease. The diagnosis of scrapie in Tg2866(MoPrP-P101L)PrPo/o mice was based on established clinical, pathologic, and biochemical criteria (31Telling G.C. Haga T. Torchia M. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1736-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The presence of PrPSc in Tg2866(MoPrP-P101L)PrPo/o mice was confirmed by detergent insolubility (31Telling G.C. Haga T. Torchia M. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B.

For the purposes of clarity, symptomatic Tg2866(MoPrP-P101L)PrPo/o transgenic animals are referred to as “scrapie-sick.” PrPo/o mice were derived from back-crossings of Tg2866(MoPrP-P101L)PrPo/o mice with commercially available wild-type FVB mice. Mice were genotyped by PCR using primers specific for the mouse PrP gene (5′-AGGGTTGACGCCATGACTTTC-3′ and 5′-CAGGGCCCGACACAGAGAAGCAAGAATGAG-3′) or the 3′-untranslated hamster sequence present within the mutated PrP transgene insert (5′-CCACCAAGGGGGAGAACTTCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCCGTTGCCTTACTCAGCTAG-3′). PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp 2700 thermocycler. Amplification of the mouse PrP gene was performed using Taq polymerase (conditions: 94 °C for 5 min; 94 °C for 0.5 min, 64 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 0.5 min × 30 cycles; and 72 °C for 7 min); these conditions result in a 1-kb amplicon for the wild-type PrP gene and a 1.5-kb amplicon for the ablated PrP gene containing the neomycin insert. Amplification of the 3′-untranslated region of the hamster insert was performed using Vent polymerase (settings: 97 °C for 7 min; 96 °C for 0.5 min, 65 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1.0 min × 30 cycles; and 72 °C for 5 min), resulting in a 680-bp amplicon. Brains from wild-type FVB mice inoculated with the Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) prion strain or from un-inoculated controls were generously provided by Dr. Stephen DeArmond (University of California San Francisco). Ten percent brain homogenates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 25 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Brains from 24-month-old littermate control mice and end-stage transgenic Tg2576 mice carrying the K670N/M671L double mutation in the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) (32Hsiao K. Chapman P.

All animal protocols were approved by the Oregon Health & Sciences University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Cell Cultures—Mouse neuroblastoma N2a and ScN2a cell lines were a generous gift of Dr. Stanley Prusiner (University of California San Francisco). The presence of PrPSc in ScN2a was confirmed by proteinase K digestion (data not shown). ScN2a and N2a cells were cultured as described previously (33Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 25 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Western Blot Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA assay. Fifty-microgram aliquots of brain or cell culture homogenate were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose by standard techniques. Loading of equal amounts of protein was confirmed by Ponceau S staining of the nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). All antibodies were diluted in TBST. Antibody sources, species, and dilutions were as follows: rabbit SRC-2, rabbit N-16, and mouse monoclonal antibodies against Fyn, Lck, and Yes were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; each was used at 1:1000. Mouse monoclonal pp60Src (clone 327) (34Lipsich L.A. Lewis A.J. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Joan Brugge (Harvard) and used at 1:5000. Mouse monoclonal anti-human transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used at 1:500; rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine-416 was purchased from Cell Signaling and used at 1:500. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse and horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit were purchased from Pierce and used at 1:25,000. Bound antibody was detected with SuperSignal (Pierce) chemiluminescent reagent and exposure to light-sensitive film. Western blot exposures were digitized using a flat bed scanner and analyzed using NIH Image (public domain software for Macintosh computers developed at the United States National Institutes of Health and available on the internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Statistical analysis was performed using InStat (GraphPad software). Values on an individual blot were normalized against the average density from wild-type animals on that same blot. Levels of SRC-2 immunoreactive material in scrapie-sick, PrPo/o, and wild-type mice or of Src, Fyn, Lck, and Yes between mice or between cells were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison post-test. Comparisons between scrapie-sick animals and wild-type animals or between ScN2a cells and N2a cells were performed using the unpaired t test. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed using standard protocols by incubating 0.5 mg of brain homogenate with 5 μl of pp60Src-protein A-Sepharose resin (35Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 321-325Google Scholar). The pp60Src was covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose at a concentration of 1.0 μg antibody/μl protein A resin using dimethyl pimelimidate (35Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 321-325Google Scholar). Bound antigen was eluted with SDS buffer under non-reducing conditions. Src-family tyrosine kinases share a common structural motif characterized by multiple conserved functional domains and a unique N-terminal region (26Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). In order to maximize the probability of detecting changes in SFK levels, initial studies screened brain homogenates from scrapie-sick transgenic mice, as well as wild-type and PrPo/o controls, utilizing an antibody against the conserved C terminus (SRC-2). These studies revealed a band that was clearly increased in the scrapie-sick mice as compared with the wild-type and PrPo/o mice (Fig. 1A). The apparent molecular mass of the immunoreactive band was ∼60 kDa, consistent with that expected for the SFKs. Wild-type and PrPo/o control mice had similar levels of SFKs. Densitometric analysis of four separate sets of scrapie-sick, wild-type, and PrPo/o mice revealed a 1.8-fold increase in SFKs in scrapie-sick mice as compared with wild-type controls. ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple post-test comparison confirmed a statistically significant increase in the scrapie-sick Tg2866(MoPrP P101L)/PrPo/o mice (Fig. 1B; p = 0.0038), with no difference between wild-type controls and PrPo/o mice. Levels of SFKs were also examined in a scrapie-sick RML-inoculated mouse and an asymptomatic un-inoculated control (Fig. 1C); densitometric analysis (data not shown) revealed a 1.6-fold increase. Because only a single pair of brains using the RML model was available, statistical comparison could not be performed. Nonetheless, these studies revealed a remarkable similarity between the scrapie-sick RML mouse and the transgenic animals. During the course of the prion diseases, the brain undergoes a number of reactive and degenerative changes such as astrogliosis, vacuolation, and neuronal loss. In addition, the PrP 106–126 peptide has been shown to activate the SFKs Lyn and Syk in microglial cells (36Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Cannady S.B. Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 928-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to clarify whether the observed SFK elevations in brain are due primarily to PrPSc rather than to a secondary nonspecific reactive process, levels of SFKs were determined in N2a and ScN2a cells. Western blotting with the SRC-2 antibody revealed a marked increase in SFK immunoreactivity in ScN2a cells as compared with N2a cells (Fig. 2A). Densitometric analysis confirmed a very highly statistically significant increase of SRC-2 immunoreactivity in the ScN2a cells (Fig. 2B; unpaired t test, p = 0.0007). This indicates that the elevation of SFKs in the presence of PrPSc is not dependent on the presence of a non-neuronal cell population. Identification of elevated steady-state SFK levels in the scrapie-sick transgenic animals, RML-inoculated animals, and ScN2a cells strongly argues the increases are related to the presence of PrPSc. Elevations were not identified in 65-day-old presymptomatic Tg2866(MoPrP-P101L)PrPo/o mice (see Fig. 8A for the disease time course) or homogenates from end-stage Tg2576 mice overexpressing doubly mutated human App (Fig. 3A) (32Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3712) Google Scholar). Histologic examination demonstrated abundant cortical and hippocampal plaques (Fig. 3B), indicating the lack of SFK increase was not due to the absence of aggregated amyloid β-peptide (Aβ).Fig. 2Src-family kinases are elevated in PrPSc-infected cells.

A, Tg2866(MoPrP P101L)/PrPo/o mice were monitored for the onset of scrapie symptoms (31Telling G.C. Haga T. Torchia M. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1736-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The percentage of disease-free animals is plotted against the age of the animals in days. As can be seen, these animals develop disease in a highly predictable manner. B, brain homogenates from Tg2866(MoPrP(P101L))/PrPo/o mice sacrificed at the indicated times were analyzed for levels of SFKs and the presence of detergent-soluble (PrPC), detergent-insoluble (PrPSc), or total PrP. Each component was compared against levels from a wild-type control mouse of 126 days of age. SFK accumulation parallels the appearance of detergent-insoluble PrPSc and precedes symptom onset.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3SFKs are not increased in Tg2576 controls.

Neurol. 2001; 168: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) shows abundant cortical and hippocampal plaques.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the above-mentioned studies, equal amounts of sample were compared as determined by protein determinations and Ponceau S staining of the nitrocellulose membrane before immunoblotting. However, to further ensure that the observed differences in SFK levels were not the result of irregularities in sample preparation or loading, Western blotting for the transferrin receptor was performed. The transferrin receptor is a non-raft membrane protein frequently used as a control in studies of SFK activation due to aggregation of GPI-linked proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, equivalent levels of transferrin receptor were present in scrapie-sick, wild-type, and PrPo/o mice. Similarly, immunoblotting of cell lysates revealed that the ScN2a cells had equal or slightly lower levels of transferrin receptor as compared with N2a cells (Fig. 4). Thus, the elevations in SFK immunoreactivity seen with PrPSc infection were not due to disparities in sample loading and were not the result of a generalized increase in membrane protein content. Confirmation that the elevated SRC-2 immunoreactive material in the scrapie-sick mice was indeed a SFK was obtained using a combination of immunoabsorption and Western blotting. Brain homogenates were first immunoabsorbed with the Src-specific monoclonal antibody pp60Src (34Lipsich L.A. Lewis A.J. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Absorbed material was subsequently eluted and analyzed by Western blotting with either SRC-2 antibody as described above or N-16 (an antibody specific for the unique domain of Src). These studies revealed a solitary 60-kDa band in the scrapie-sick samples with both SRC-2 and N-16 (Fig. 5); no detectable immunoreactive material was found in the wild-type control samples. Analysis of the immunoabsorbed brain homogenate supernatants found no residual Src (data not shown). As such, the lack of immunoprecipitable Src from the control homogenate is most probably due to nonspecific adsorptive losses. These results confirm the SRC-2 immunoreactive band identified in Fig. 1A contains Src and, furthermore, specifically identify Src as one of the SFKs elevated in scrapie-sick mice. In addition to Src, the Src-family kinases Fyn, Yes, and Lck are present in brain (26Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Because the SRC-2 antibody recognizes multiple SFK members, studies were performed to determine the levels of these SFKs in scrapie infection. A composite image of typical results from Western blotting of mouse brain homogenates probed with antibodies specific for the individual SFKs is shown in Fig. 6A. Comparison of scrapie-sick and wild-type samples suggests elevations in all four SFKs, although there was considerable variability in the extent of increase. Visual inspection suggests the largest increases are in Src and Fyn, with lesser increases in Yes and Lck. Comparison of ScN2a and N2a cell lysates also shows elevations in multiple SFKs, but with a slightly different pattern (Fig. 6B). Src and Lck appear increased; however, unlike the transgenic animals, Fyn demonstrates a much more modest increase. Yes is marginally increased. Densitometric analysis of blots from multiple individual scrapie-sick and wild-type animals or homogenates of N2a and ScN2a cells is shown in Fig"

It has a more complex structure when compared with other allergens and therefore expression of recombinant Fel d 1 has been considered a challenge. The present study shows for the first time that a Baculovirus expression system is able to produce an intact rFel d 1 molecule that is glycosylated and structurally equivalent to the natural cat allergen, nFel d 1. Enzymatic digestion of rFel d 1 and further analysis by use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) resulted in a complete coverage of the amino acid sequence of rFel d 1. In addition, the three disulfide bridges at the positions α70-β7, α44-β48, and α3-β73 were verified. The N-glycan structure of rFel d 1 was investigated by a combination of MALDI-TOF MS and monosaccharide analysis by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAC). The N-glycosylation analyses of rFel d 1 refer to a pattern of glycoforms including core α1.3-fucosylation that is different from nFel d 1. Further characterization by use of human serum IgE, histamine release, and lymphocyte proliferation assays demonstrated that the immunological characteristics of rFel d 1 are similar to those of nFel d 1.

Detailed characterization of both natural and recombinant allergens provides tools to explore immunological mechanisms associated with allergen sensitization and desensitization. Domestic cat (Felis domesticus) is one of the most common household pets, and cat dander is a significant source of indoor allergens. Approximately 20–30% of individuals suffering from allergic asthma respond in vitro and/or in vivo to cat allergens (1Schou C. Allergy and Allergic Diseases. 1st Ed. Blackwell Sciences, London1996: 900-902Google Scholar). Sensitization to cat allergens leads into formation of allergen-specific IgE antibodies. Allergic reaction arises when these antibodies are able to facilitate activation of effector cells within the immune system. Activation of effector cells in return leads into release of histamine, eicosanoid synthesis, and cytokine gene expression (2Prussin C. Metcalfe D.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: S486-S494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The subsequent immunological response per se is an outcome of cell mediators rather than allergen(s).Specific allergen immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in modulating allergic responses and resulting in down-regulation of allergen-specific T-cell responses (3Till S.J.

Further analyses of the natural molecule have verified that the single N-glycosylation site in the β-chain is carrying heterogeneous triantennary complex type of structures.

The recently solved three-dimensional structure of a head-to-tail construct expressed in E. coli suggests that Fel d 1 belongs to the secretoglobin family of proteins (26Kaiser L. Grönlund H.

The N-glycan structure of rFel d 1 was investigated by combination of MALDI-TOF MS and monosaccharide analysis by HPAEC-PAD. The immunobiological characterization and comparison with nFel d 1 was performed in vitro using IgE inhibition, histamine release, and lymphocyte proliferation assays.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of the Synthetic Genes Encoding Fel d 1 Polypeptide Chains—Synthetic genes encoding Fel d 1 α- and β-chains (α: M74952/β: M77341) were assembled by PCR using overlapping oligonucleotides (Table I). In short, primers A1+A2 and A3+A4 for the α-chain and B1+B2 and B3+B4 for the β-chain were annealed and amplified in six cycles. Extension primers α-chain (ARF/ARR) and β-chain (BRF/BRR) with specific restriction sites were used to rescue the full-length products. The fragments were then cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and their sequences were confirmed (ABI PRISM® 377 DNA sequencer; Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA).Table IPrimers used for construction of synthetic Fel d 1 genesα-Chain A1GAAATCTGCC CGGCTGTTAA ACGTGACGTT GACCTGTTCC TGACCGGTAC CCCGGACGAA TACGTTGA A2CGAGCGTTTT CCAGAACAAC CGGCAGAGCT TTGTACTGAG CAACCTGTTC AACGTATTCG TCCGGGGT A3GTTGTTCTGG AAAACGCTCG TATCCTGAAA AACTGCGTTG ACGCTAAAAT GACCGAAGAA GACAAAGA A4TCAGCACAGC GGGGAGGTGT AGATTTTGTC CAGCAGGGAC AGAGCGTTTT CTTTGTCTTC TTCGGTCAT ARFGGTGGTTGCT CTTCCAACGA AATCTGCCCG GCTGTTAA ARRGGTGGTCTGC AGTCAGCACA GCGGGGAGGTβ-Chain B1GTTAAAATGG CTGAAACCTG CCCGATCTTC TACGACGTTT TCTTCGCTGT TGCTAACGGT AACGAACTGC TGCTGGACCT GTCCC B2AACGTAGCAG TCCTGGATTT TTTTCATAGC GGTACGTTCC GGTTCGGTAG CGTTAACTTT GGTCAGGGAC AGGTCCAGCA GCAGT B3AAATCCAGGA CTGCTACGTT GAAAACGGTC TGATCTCCCG TGTTCTGGAC GGTCTGGTTA TGACCACCAT CTCCTCCTCC AAAGA B4TCAACGACCC AGGGTGTTCA GTTTCAGGTC TTCAACGGTG TTCTGAACAG CTTCACCCAT GCAGTCTTTG GAGGAGGAGA TGGT BRFGGTGGTTGCT CTTCCAACGT TAAAATGGCT GAAACCTGCC BRRGGTGGTCTGC AGTCAACGAC CCAGGGTGTT Open table in a new tab Construction of Recombinant Baculovirus Vector—The construction of the recombinant Baculovirus vector and the expression of the rFel d 1 was performed by CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc (Cambridge, UK). The cDNA encoding the mature α- and β-chains were subcloned into Baculovirus shuttle vector pFastBacDUAL (Invitrogen). The mellitin signal sequence was engineered to the N-terminal of both genes by PCR (Fig. 1). The recombinant dual vector was then transformed into MAX efficiency DH10Bac™ competent cells (Invitrogen) containing the baculovirus genome. Within the cell a transposition takes place between a mini-attTn7 target site and the mini-Tn7 element on the vector when recombinant virus is generated. The resulting recombinant bacmid was confirmed according to the suppliers′ manual (Invitrogen).Expression of the rFel d 1—Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) (Invitrogen) cells were used to generate the primary virus titer for the expression of rFel d 1. The Sf21 cells were grown in 47.5% ExCell 401(JHR Biosciences), 47.5% TC100 (Invitrogen) and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) as suspension cultures in shaker flask(s) (24Rogers B.L. Morgernstern J.P Garman R.D. Bond J.F. Kuo M-C. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Sf21 cells were transfected with recombinant bacmid DNA in the presence of Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's manual (Invitrogen). The culture medium was collected 7 days post-transfection. The virus titer was assessed by plaque assay (29O′Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 135-136Google Scholar). For large virus stock production SF21 cells were infected with the recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in a spinner bottle. The virus was harvested 7 days post-infection and titered again by plaque assay. High Five™ cells (Invitrogen) were used for protein production and cultured according to the manufacturer's instruction. For protein production the cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The cell supernatant was harvested 96 h post-infection.Purification of Natural and rFel d 1—Natural Fel d 1 was isolated by use of monoclonal immunoaffinity chromatography from dried cat allergen extract (ALK-Abelló) as described (20Kroll-Kristensen A.K. Schou C. Roepstorff P. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Natural Fel d 1 was then subjected to HR 5/5 Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–100% 20 mm Tris-Cl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5, in 20 min. Eluted fractions containing nFel d 1 were pooled and subjected to size exclusion chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) in a 10 mm NH4(HCO)2 buffer and freeze dried. For the immunological assays, nFel d 1 was dissolved into sterile Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen). Endotoxin levels in the purified Fel d 1 preparations were <15 EU/mg as determined by Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (Bio Whittaker, Walkersville, MD).Recombinant Fel d 1 was isolated from the High Five™ cell culture supernatant. The cells were gently centrifuged, and the culture supernatant was collected and sterile filtrated. The purification of rFel d 1 followed the protocol described for the nFel d 1.SDS-PAGE Analysis of Affinity Purified rFel d 1—16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) was used to analyze collected fractions (10 μl/10 ml) from monoclonal affinity chromatography. The electrophoresis was performed in reducing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions and stained with silver (Invitrogen).Protein Measurements—A Lambda 800 UV-visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to measure protein concentration at 280 nm using the absorption coefficient A280 (1 mg·ml–1 cm–1) = 0.356 for both rFel d 1 and nFel d 1.Reversed-phase Chromatography—Lyophilized rFel d 1 was first dissolved (47 pmol/μl) into Milli-Q grade water (Millipore, Bedford, MA). 5 nmol of rFel d 1 in 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid (Rathburn Chemicals, Peebleshire, UK) was subjected to a 4.6 × 250-mm Jupiter, C5 reversed-phase column (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA). The column was equilibrated with 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid, and the sample was eluted with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile (Riedel-de-Hein, Seelze, Germany) in a gradient of 25–55% in 15 column volume and 55–80% in 5 column volume. Recombinant Fel d 1 eluted as a single peak and was collected and dried in a Speedvac. The dried fraction was redissolved into water, divided into 1-nmol aliquots, dried, and stored at –20 °C.The fractionation of the peptide mixtures were performed in a 4.6 × 250-mm Jupiter C18 (Phenomenex) column. The peptides were eluted with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile in a gradient of 5–45% in 30 column volume or 45–80% in 5 column volume. The separated peptides were dried in a vacuum Speedvac, redissolved into water, and stored at –20 °C.Mass Spectrometric Analyses—Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a Voyager-DE™ STR Biospectrometry™ (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) MALDI-TOF MS instrument by use of acceleration voltage of 25 kV and a nitrogen laser at 337 nm. The spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode and calibrated externally. MS/MS of selected peptides was performed on a Micromass® Q-Tof Ultima MALDI mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK).20 pmol of intact rFel d 1 was desalted by custom-made micro columns packed with POROS R1/50 (Applied Biosystems, Framington, MA) reversed-phase resin (30Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The samples were eluted directly on MALDI targets with 1.0 μl of matrix solution containing 10 μg/μl α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. To analyze the molecular mass of the α- and β-chain, 20 pmol of rFel d 1 was reduced by 45 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) at 56 °C for 30 min and alkylated by 100 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Desalting and the MALDI-TOF MS analyses of the sample were then performed as described for the intact protein. Trypsin (NovoNordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), acyl-CoA-binding protein (Sigma), and a Sequazyme™ peptide mass standard kit (Applied Biosystems) were used as external calibrants. Theoretical masses were calculated by GPMAW (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark).Proteolytic Digestions—500 pmol of rFel d 1 was reduced and alkylated as described above. The sample(s) were dissolved into 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 m urea, pH 8.5, and incubated with 3% (w/w) endoproteinase Asp-N (Calbiochem, Sunnyvale, CA) at 37 °C for 18 h (20Kroll-Kristensen A.K. Schou C. Roepstorff P. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assignment of the disulfide bridges was performed by enzymatic digestion employing endoproteinase Asp-N (Calbiochem) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 m urea, pH 8.5, and by sequential digestion with 3% (w/w) trypsin (Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin, Promega, Madison, WI) and 3% (w/w) chymotrypsin (Wako Chemicals GmbH, Richmond, VA) (20Kroll-Kristensen A.K. Schou C. Roepstorff P. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 mm NH4Ac, pH 6.0.Edman Degradation—Sequencing of the rFel d 1-derived peptides was performed with Hewlett Packard G1000A sequencer (Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a Hewlett Packard 1090 series II liquid chromatograph and run as described by the manufacturer.Acid Hydrolysis and Monosaccharide Analysis— 1 mg of rFel d 1 was hydrolyzed in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h, subsequently lyophilized in a Speedvac, and resuspended in water. The monosaccharides were analyzed by HPAEC-PAD using a Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) P-500 chromatographic system consisting of Carbo PacPA-10 preanalytical and analytical columns, an AS50 auto sampler, a GP40 gradient pump, and an ED40 electrochemical detector. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the injection volume was 10 μl. Separation was achieved isocratically with water as eluent. A pump with 600 mm NaOH as eluent was used to improve the sensitivity of detection. l-fucose (Merck), d-xylose (Fluka), d-mannose (Merck), d-glucose (Merck), d-galactose (BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, UK), GlcNAc (BDH Chemicals Ltd.), N-acetylgalactosamine (BDH Chemicals Ltd.), and d-arabinose (Sigma) were treated as described above and used as standards.Structural Analysis of the N-Glycan—Removal of N-glycan was assessed with recombinant N-glycosidase F from Flavobacterium meningosepticum (Roche Applied Science) and N-glycosidase A from almonds (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 18 h. The resulting products were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Applied Biosystems) (30Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The sequential digestions with glycosidases were performed following the procedure of Kroll-Kristensen et al. (20Kroll-Kristensen A.K. Schou C. Roepstorff P. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).IgE Inhibition Analyses—The IgE inhibition experiments were performed on an ADVIA Centaur Immunoassay system (Bayer Diagnostics, Denmark) (31Petersen A.B. Gudmann P. Milvang-Gronager P. Morkeberg R. Bogestrand S. Linneberg A. Johansen N. Clin. Biochem. 2004; 37: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Pooled human serum IgE from cat-allergic individuals (n = 4) was coupled to the solid phase (ADVIA Centaur Universal Reagent Pack, no. 123736), after which the surface was washed with 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.1% (w/v) human serum albumin, pH 7.4 (ADIVIA Centaur reagent, no. 1011132). Mixtures of a constant amount of biotinylated cat allergen extract and diluted allergen preparations were added. The amount of biotinylated Fel d allergens bound to the solid phase absorbed IgE was determined as the number of relative light units after the addition of ADVIA Centaur Lite reagent (Universal reagent pack). All of the inhibition experiments were performed as triplicates, and the data sets (log10(concentration), mean (DoB)) were fitted to a four-parameter logistic function using GraphPad Prism version 4.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).Histamine Release Assay—Histamine release assay was performed using freshly drawn blood from cat-allergic individuals (n = 4) and controls (n = 4). The tested individuals gave their informed consent to donate blood for research purposes. The antigens, rFeld1 and nFeld1, were diluted into Pipes buffer (Invitrogen). Antigens were then mixed with the blood samples and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Analyses were performed in a final concentration ranging from 1.5 pg/ml to 500 ng/ml of antigen(s). The samples were then centrifuged, and the supernatants were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (kit IM 2015; Immunotech). The release of histamine was measured at 405 nm by an EL 340 Biokinetics reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT).Lymphocyte Proliferation—T-cell lines specific to Fel d 1 were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of cat-allergic patients (n = 5) as described previously for grass allergen-specific T-cell lines (32Wurtzen P.A. Bufe A. Wissenbach M. Madsen H.O. Ipsen H. Arved J. van Neerven J.J. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1999; 29: 1614-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In short, freshly isolated PBMCs (2 × 106/ml) were stimulated in 1-ml bulk cultures with natural or rFel d 1 (2 μg/ml) for 14 days with the addition of recombinant interleukin-2 from day 5. After 14 days T-cells were restimulated with irradiated autologous PBMCs, Fel d 1 (2 μg/ml), and 0.05 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin-P (Difco, Detroit, MI), and recombinant interleukin 2 was added at days 3, 4, and 5.T-cell Stimulation Assay—On day 10 after restimulation, T-cells (2 × 104/well) were cultured with autologous PBMCs (105/well, irradiated 2500 Rad) in 200 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% v/v AB serum (Cambrex Bio Sciences), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). The culturing was performed with or without antigen in 96-well round-bottomed microtiter plates (Nunc). The cells were cultured for 72 h in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2, followed by a 16-h pulse with 0.5 C [3H]thymidine/well, and thymidine incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. The results are expressed as the mean cpm values of four replicate cultures.RESULTSPurification of rFel d 1—Expression of rFel d 1 was demonstrated from the insect cell culture supernatant by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (data not shown). Monoclonal affinity chromatography was used to capture rFel d 1 from culture supernatant. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that rFel d 1 was bound to the monoclonal antibody column and eluted in a single step. Both α- and the β-chain were detected when stained with silver (Fig. 2). Affinity purified native rFel d 1 was then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, which revealed a major peak in the m/z ranging from 18,000 to 19,000. In addition, a peak at m/z 8000 was seen, indicating overexpression and co-purification of free α-chain (data not shown). Anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography were used to remove the free α-chain and other impurities. For MS analyses, rFel d 1 was subjected to reversed-phase chromatography. The total yield of purified dry weight rFel d 1 was from 1 to 3 mg/liter of culture supernatant. The purity of reduced and nonreduced natural and rFel d 1 was verified by MALDI-TOF MS as described below.Fig. 2SDS-PAGE analysis of monoclonal affinity purified rFel d 1 in reducing conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1986248919,"The stimulatory GTP-binding protein of adenylyl cyclase (AC) regulates hormone-stimulated production of cAMP. Here, we demonstrate that Cu2+ and Zn2+ inhibit the steady-state GTPase activity of the α subunit of GTP-binding protein (Gαs) but do not alter its intrinsic GTPase activity. Cu2+ and Zn2+ decrease steady-state GTPase activity by inhibiting the binding of GTP to Gαs. Moreover, Cu2+ and Zn2+ increase GDP dissociation from Gαs and render the G protein in a nucleotide-free state. However, these cations do not alter the dissociation of the guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) that is already bound to the Gαs. Because of their ability to inhibit GTPγS binding, preincubation of Cu2+ or Zn2+ with Gαs does not permit GTPγS to activate Gαs and stimulate AC activity. However, preincubation of Gαs with GTPγS followed by addition of Cu2+ or Zn2+ did not alter the ability of Gαs to stimulate AC activity. Interestingly, AlF4− partially restored the ability of Gαs, which had been preincubated with Cu2+ or Zn2+, to stimulate AC; AlF4− does not permit the re-association of unbound GDP with Gαs. Thus, the interaction of AlF4− with the nucleotide-free Gαs is sufficient to activate AC. Using antibodies to the N and C termini of Gαs, we show that the Cu2+ interaction site on the G protein is in the C terminus. We conclude that Cu2+ and Zn2+ generate a nucleotide-free state of Gαs and that, in the absence of any nucleotide, the γ-phosphate mimic of GTP, AlF4−, alters Gαs structure sufficiently to permit stimulation of AC activity. Moreover, our finding that isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity was more sensitive to inhibition by Cu2+ and Zn2+ as compared with forskolin-stimulated activity is consistent with Gαs being a primary target of these cations in regulating the signaling from receptor to AC.

Silva D. Thompson R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1471S-1483SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because cAMP plays a crucial role in the regulation of a number of cellular processes, one study has investigated the actions of Zn2+ on ACs and shown that Zn2+ inhibits the activity of type I, V, and VI ACs (22Klein C.

The hormonal stimulation of cAMP was also attenuated by Zn2+ (22Klein C. Sunahara R.K. Hudson T.Y. Heyduk T. Howlett A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11859-11865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether and how Cu2+ and Zn2+ would influence the function of trimeric GTP-binding proteins that play an important role in regulating the activity of AC and synthesis of second messenger cAMP. Here we demonstrate that, at concentrations as low as 10 μm, Cu2+ and Zn2+ severely impair the function of Gαs. Both Cu2+ and Zn2+ cause the release of bound GDP from Gαs and inhibit the further binding of GTP, resulting in the formation of a nucleotide-free state of Gαs that is incapable in stimulating its effector, AC. Interestingly, the addition of aluminum fluoride, which mimics the γ phosphate of GTP on the GDP-bound form of G protein α subunits (23Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 24Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), permits the nucleotide-free Gαs to activate AC. Our results provide a possible prime target for Cu2+ and Zn2+ in their toxicity in vivo. Our findings also imply that Cu2+ or Zn2+ by altering the function of G proteins can interfere with hormone-mediated changes in AC activity. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Gαs—N-terminal 6× His-tagged recombinant bovine Gαs and myristoylated rat Gαi1 were expressed and purified as described previously (25Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Wittpoth C. Scholich K. Bilyeu J.D. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25915-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The proteins were stored in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20%(v/w) glycerol. The Gαs used in our experiments was the short form (380 amino acids long). Wild type and cyc– S49 cell membranes that contain predominantly type VI and VII ACs (27Premont R.T. Jacobowitz O. Iyengar R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were isolated as described previously (26Wittpoth C. Scholich K. Bilyeu J.D. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25915-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The N terminus of 6× His-tagged Gαs contains an anti-Xpress antibody epitope. Thus, the protein was detected on Western blots with either the anti-Xpress antibody purchased from Invitrogen or a C-terminal epitope recognizing antibody obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). As monitored by GTPγS binding, the G protein preparations derived by these methods were 10–20% active. Steady-state GTPase Activity—Steady-state GTPase activity was measured in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP (∼5000 dpm/pmol), and the indicated concentration of Gαs in the presence and absence of Cu2+ or Zn2+ at room temperature for 10–20 min. The reactions were terminated with ice-cold charcoal slurry (5% (w/v) in 50 mm NaH2PO4), and after centrifugation (20,000 × g for 10 min) aliquots of the supernatant were counted for 32Pi release. Single Cycle GTPase Assays—The single cycle GTPase activity was measured as described by Berman et al. (28Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) with the following modification. Gαs (100 μg/ml) was first incubated at room temperature for 10 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP (60 dpm/fmol). The temperature was lowered to 4 °C, and incubation continued for another 10 min. For time zero, 10-μl aliquots (1 μg of Gαs) were withdrawn and quenched with 0.99 ml of charcoal suspension in 50 mm NaH2PO4 described above. Within 10 s of withdrawing the zero time point, 100 μl of the reaction mixture was diluted to 1 ml with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm CuSO4 or ZnSO4, and 1 mm GTP. At the indicated time points, 100-μl aliquots were withdrawn and mixed with 0.9 ml of charcoal suspension. 32Pi release was monitored as described for steady-state GTPase activity assay. GDP or GTPγS Release and GTPγS Binding—GDP release in absence or presence of AlF4− was measured by incubating Gαs (100 μg/ml) with trace amount of [α-32P]GTP in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgSO4 without or with 30 μm AlCl3 and 2 mm NaF for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then diluted 10 times in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm GTP, and without or with AlF4− (30 μm AlCl3 and 2 mm NaF), and 100 μm CuSO4 or ZnSO4. Aliquots (100 μl) were withdrawn at the indicated times and filtered through PROTRAN BA85 filters (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) as described previously (29Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 762-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTPγS release was determined by first incubating Gαs (100 μg/ml) with 1 μm [35S]GTPγS in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgSO4 for 1 h at room temperature, and subsequently diluted 10 times in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm GTP, and the 100 μm CuSO4 or ZnSO4. Aliquots (100 μl) were withdrawn at the indicated times and filtered through PROTRAN BA85 filters as described above. GTPγS binding was measured by incubating Gαs (1 μg of protein) at room temperature in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 μm [35S]GTPγS (∼3000 dpm/pmol), and indicated concentrations of CuSO4 or ZnSO4. After 1-h incubation, 90-μl aliquots were withdrawn and filtered as described above. Adenylyl Cyclase Activity Assays—AC activity was measured as described previously (30Nair B.G. Parikh B. Milligan G. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21317-21322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 10 μg of S49 membranes in 100 μl of reaction mix containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GTP or GTPγS, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm cAMP, ∼15,000 dpm [3H]cAMP, and ∼400 dpm/pmol [α-32P]ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system at room temperature for 20 min. Reactions were initiated by adding the assay mixture and were stopped with 50 μl of ice-cold, 3× stopping buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6% SDS, 3 mm cAMP, and 3 mm ATP). cAMP was separated by chromatography on two sequential columns of Dowex AG50 WX-4 and alumina, and the amount of 32P label in this fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cleavage of Gαs by Cu2+ in the Presence of Ascorbate and H2O2—Gαs (4 μg) was incubated with 10 μm CuSO4 in 20 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm MgSO4 for 10 min at room temperature. Cleavage of Gαs was initiated by adding 1 mm H2O2 and 10 mm ascorbate. Reactions were stopped after 10 min with 10 mm EDTA and 10 mm DTT. The cleaved Gαs was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and the membranes were blocked by incubation in 10% newborn calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Duplicate sets of membranes were incubated either with anti-Xpress antibody (1:5000 dilution) or anti-Gαs C-terminal antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h, respectively, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Pierce. Cu2+ and Zn2+ Inhibit the Steady-state GTPase Activities of Gαs—To determine whether Cu2+ and Zn2+ alter Gαs function, we first examined the effects of these metal cations on the steady-state GTPase activity. The divalent metal cations, Cu2+ and Zn2+, were added directly in the reaction mixture without preincubation with Gαs. As shown in Fig. 1A, the steady-state GTPase activity of Gαs was completely inhibited by Cu2+ at concentrations higher than 10 μm with an IC50 for Cu2+ of ∼3 μm. Copper at this concentration has been reported to accumulate inside cells (21Tholey G. Ledig M. Mandel P. Sargentini L. Frivold A.H. Leroy M. Grippo A.A. Wedler F.C. Neurochem. Res. 1988; 13: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, the onset of inhibition of the steady-state GTPase activity of Gαs by Cu2+ was very fast (Fig. 1A, inset). Within minutes of the addition of 20 μm CuSO4, the steady-state GTPase activity of Gαs was completely inhibited. Because the experiments in Fig. 1A were performed with 6× His-tagged Gαs, we investigated whether Cu2+ or Zn2+ also inhibited untagged Gαs. Essentially, both metal cations inhibited untagged Gαs in a manner similar to the N-terminally tagged Gαs (data not shown). Thus, Cu2+ and Zn2+ do not inhibit the steady-state GTPase activity by interacting with the N-terminal 6× His tag on Gαs. The inhibition of steady-state GTPase activity by Cu2+ and Zn2+ is not specific for Gαs only. Hence, at concentrations similar to those shown for Gαs in Fig. 1A, the metal cations also inhibit the steady-state GTPase activity of the inhibitory GTP-binding protein of AC, Gαi1 (Fig. 1B). That the inhibition of Gαs steady-state GTPase activity by Cu2+ or Zn2+ is specific is shown by the findings that other divalent cations such as Ni2+ or Fe2+ did not inhibit the steady-state GTPase activity of Gαs (Fig. 1C). If anything, Ni2+ modestly stimulated the steady-state GTPase activity of Gαs. Nevertheless, the data with Ni2+ (Fig. 1C) further emphasize the fact that the N-terminal tag on Gαs is not responsible for the inhibition that is observed with Cu2+ or Zn2+. It is possible that the inhibition of Gαs function may be due to the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups caused by Cu2+ and Zn2+. However, this seems not to be the case, because preincubation of Gαs with Cu2+ or Zn2+ for 10 min followed by incubation with 1 mm DTT did not result in any significant recovery of steady-state GTPase activity (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, preincubation of Cu2+ or Zn2+ with 1 mm DTT prior to the addition of Gαs completely neutralized their ability to inhibit steady-state GTPase activity (not shown). To determine if EDTA by chelating the Cu2+ or Zn2+ could reverse the inhibition of steady state GTPase activity of Gαs, the experiments shown in Fig. 2B were performed. Essentially, after incubation of Gαs with 20 μm each of Cu2+ or Zn2+, 1 mm EDTA was added to the incubations. The calculated free Cu2+ and Zn2+ concentrations in the presence of EDTA would be 4 × 10–15 m and 2.6 × 10–12 m, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2B, under these conditions the inhibition of steady-state GTPase activity was not reversed. These data suggest that either the metal cations are bound to Gαs with a very high affinity as demonstrated for interactions between protein phosphatase 1 and cobalt (32Chu Y. Lee E.Y. Schlender K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2574-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or that the Cu2+ and Zn2+ somehow modify the Gαs. Whatever the mechanism, the inhibition of steady-state GTPase activity of Gαs is not reversed by either EDTA or DTT. Cu2+ or Zn2+ Do Not Affect Catalysis but Inhibit the GTPγS Binding—The steady-state GTPase activity of Gαs can be decreased either by inhibiting the rate of GTP hydrolysis or by inhibiting the rate of GTP-GDP exchange (33Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 757-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional experiments were performed to determine which of the two aforementioned possibilities contributes to the inhibition of steady-state Gαs-GTPase activity by Cu2+ and Zn2+. First, we examined the effects of Cu2+ and Zn2+ on the single cycle GTP hydrolysis by Gαs. This assay measures the ability of the G protein α subunits to hydrolyze prebound GTP and, therefore, is independent of the rate of GTP-GDP exchange (28Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Essentially, Gαs was first loaded with γ-32P-labeled GTP in the presence of EDTA followed by dilution into buffer containing Mg2+ and excess of GTP in the absence or presence of 200 μm each of Cu2+ or Zn2+. As shown in Fig. 3A, neither Cu2+ nor Zn2+ altered the single cycle GTP hydrolysis by Gαs. Under the conditions of the experiment in Fig. 3A, the calculated free Cu2+ and Zn2+ concentrations were 2.6 and 27 μm, respectively. Notably, at these concentrations, Cu2+ and Zn2+ inhibit the steady-state GTPase activity by ∼50% and ≥90%, respectively (Fig. 1). Therefore, the data in Fig. 3A demonstrate that alterations in the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαs do not contribute to Cu2+- and Zn2+-mediated inhibition of its steady-state GTPase activity. The crystal structure of Gαs shows that Mg2+ is coordinated with the β- and γ-phosphate groups of GTP and directly participates in the catalysis (7Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In this respect, the inability of Cu2+ or Zn2+ to inhibit the single cycle GTP hydrolysis by Gαs suggests that the inhibition of the steady-state GTPase activity of Gαs by Cu2+ or Zn2+ is not due to competition with Mg2+ for binding at the catalytic site on Gαs. Moreover, these results (Fig. 3A) suggest that Cu2+ or Zn2+ interact at one or more sites distinct from the Mg2+ binding site in the catalytic pocket of Gαs. Next, we examined if Cu2+ or Zn2+ altered the binding of GTPγS to Gαs. As demonstrated in Fig. 3B, Cu2+ and Zn2+ abrogated GTPγS binding to Gαs at concentrations >5 μm. The IC50 ∼ 2.5 μm for Cu2+-mediated inhibition of GTPγS binding is similar to that required for inhibition of steady-state GTPase activity. Overall, the findings in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the divalent metal cations, Cu2+ and Zn2+, inhibit steady-state GTPase activity of Gαs by decreasing the binding of GTP and not the intrinsic GTPase activity of the G protein. Cu2+ and Zn2+ Induce an Empty State of Gαs by Promoting the Release of GDP and Blocking Further Binding of Guanine Nucleotides—The purified Gαs has a very tightly bound GDP at its nucleotide binding site (35Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding of GTPγS has frequently been used as a reflection of GDP release (35Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of GTPγS binding by Cu2+ or Zn2+ (Fig. 3B) would suggest that Cu2+ or Zn2+ may decrease the release of GDP. To directly test this possibility, we preincubated Gαs with a trace amount of α-32P-labeled GTP in the presence of Mg2+ to ensure the complete hydrolysis of the bound GTP on Gαs, and subsequently diluted the radioactivity with excess GTP in the absence or presence of 100 μm each of Cu2+ or Zn2+. Surprisingly, instead of inhibiting the rate of GDP release, Cu2+ and Zn2+ dramatically accelerated the release of GDP (Fig. 4A). The t½ for GDP release in the absence of Cu2+ or Zn2+ was about 5 min. However, within that time all GDP was released when Cu2+ or Zn2+ was present (Fig. 4A). These results combined with the inhibition of GTPγS binding (Fig. 3B) suggest that Cu2+ or Zn2+ cause the release of GDP from Gαs and prevent further binding of nucleotide and imply that the resulting Gαs is in a nucleotide-free state. It is not clear whether this empty state has any resemblance to the assumed transitional empty state that occurs when Gαs is activated by ligand-bound receptor (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). Both biochemical and structural evidence has shown that there are significant conformational changes among GDP-, GDP plus AlF4−-, and GTPγS-bound states of α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (23Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 24Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 36Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because Cu2+ and Zn2+ cause a rapid release of GDP from Gαs, we tested whether these metal cations would have different effects on the release of GDP in the presence of AlF4−. As shown in Fig. 4B, the presence of AlF4− markedly reduced the rate of release of GDP from Gαs (Fig. 4, compare A and B). However, the ability of Cu2+ and Zn2+ to accelerate the release of GDP from Gαs persisted even in the presence of AlF4− (Fig. 4B). The rate constants for release of GDP in Fig. 4B are: none (AlF4− alone): 0.072 min–1, AlF4− plus Zn2+: 0.17 min–1, and AlF4− plus Cu2+: 0.206 min–1. Although, to the best of our knowledge, the interactions between AlF4− and Cu2+ or Zn2+ have not been studied, it is possible that the difference in the GDP off rates in Fig. 4B could be attributed to some type of an interaction between the divalent metal cations and AlF4−. In contrast to the effects on GDP off rates, Cu2+ and Zn2+ did not significantly affect the release of GTPγS from Gαs (Fig. 4C). Analysis of the data in Fig. 4C demonstrated that the best fit is obtained by a one-binding site model and the average rate constants for GTPγS off were as follows: control (none in Fig. 4C): 0.109 ± 0.05 min–1; plus Cu2+: 0.104 ± 0.03 min–1; and plus Zn2+: 0.076 ± 0.009 min–1. None of these rate constants were significantly different from the others. Thus, Cu2+ and Zn2+ alter the rates of GDP off but do not affect the GTPγS off rates. These results (Fig. 4) are consistent with previous reports (23Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 24Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 36Raw A.S. Coleman D.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15660-15669Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that the structural and biochemical properties of GDP-, GDP plus AlF4−-, and GTPγS-bound forms of Gαs are different. Cu2+ and Zn2+ Modulate the Ability of Gαs to Stimulate AC—Because Cu2+ and Zn2+ alter the binding of GTPγS to Gαs and the release of GDP from this G protein, we tested the ability of the metal cations to alter the ability of Gαs to stimulate AC activity. For this purpose membranes of cells (S49 cyc–) that do not express endogenous Gαs (37Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Tomkins G.M. Science. 1975; 187: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were used. In this system, the stimulation of AC by Gαs in the presence of GTP is modest but can be substantially enhanced by forskolin. Therefore, these experiments were performed in the presence of forskolin to improve the sensitivity of the assay that monitors Gαs activity. Moreover, to preclude any effects of Cu2+ or Zn2+ on AC activity per se, after incubation of the Gαs in the presence or absence of the metal cations, DTT (1 mm) was added. It has been shown that in the presence of DTT, Zn2+ does not alter AC activity (22Klein C. Sunahara R.K. Hudson T.Y. Heyduk T. Howlett A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11859-11865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, in our experiments also this treatment did not alter control activity of AC (Fig. 5, A and B, cf. none with Cu2+ or Zn2+). As shown in Fig. 5, preincubation of Gαs with GTP or GTPγS or AlF4− resulted in stimulation of AC activity. However, when Gαs was preincubated first with Cu2+ or Zn2+ and then incubated with GTP or GTPγS for 1 h, the G protein did not stimulate AC activity (Fig. 5, A and B). This is consistent with our findings (Fig. 3B) that GTPγS binding to the G protein is inhibited by Cu2+ and Zn2+ and, therefore, the G protein is in an inactive state. On the other hand, if the Gαs was first preincubated with GTPγS and then incubation with Cu2+ or Zn2+, the ability of the G protein to stimulate AC activity was retained. This latter finding is also predictable from the observation (Fig. 4C) that once GTPγS is bound to the G protein neither Cu2+ nor Zn2+ alter its release and the Gαs is maintained in an active state. However, preincubation with GTP followed by incubation with the metal cations did not retain the ability of Gαs to stimulate AC (Fig. 5, A and B). This would be expected, because the intrinsic GTPase activity rapidly converts GTP to GDP that is then rapidly released in the presence of Cu2+ or Zn2+. Surprisingly, after preincubation of Gαs with Cu2+ or Zn2+, AlF4− partially restored the ability of Gαs to stimulate AC (Fig. 5C). These findings demonstrate that Cu2+ and Zn2+ do not irreversibly inactivate the G protein by some nonspecific action or denature the Gαs. The ability of AlF4− to partially restore the ability of Gαs that was preincubated with Cu2+ or Zn2+ to stimulate AC activity is similar to the ability of AlF4− to partially restore the ability of nucleotide-free transducin to activate cGMP phosphodiesterase (38Bigay J. Deterre P. Pfister C. Chabre M. FEBS Lett. 1985; 191: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Thus, AlF4−, by mimicking the γ-phosphate of GTP (23Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 24Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), may be sufficient to alter the conformation or the guanine nucleotide-free Gαs so that the G protein can stimulate AC activity. However, it is also possible that AlF4− increases the affinity for GDP such that, after the preincubation with Cu2+ or Zn2+, in the presence of AlF4−, GDP that is released binds back to the Gαs. To distinguish between the last two possibilities mentioned above, the experiment depicted in Fig. 6 was performed. Essentially, after loading Gαs with trace amounts of α-32P-labeled GTP and Mg2+, the G protein was passed over a Sephadex column to remove any unbound guanine nucleotide. Because of the high intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαs, under these conditions, the 32P label associated with the protein is in the GDP form. Thereafter, the Gαs was incubated with Cu2+ or Zn2+ or AlF4− followed by another incubation in the presence or absence of one of these reagents, and the amount of 32P-labeled GDP associated with the G protein was determined. As shown in Fig. 6 and consistent with the findings in Fig. 4A, incubation with Cu2+ or Zn2+ decreased the amount of 32P-labeled GDP associated with Gαs. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4B, when AlF4− was added prior to Cu2+ or Zn2+, the dissociation of GDP from Gαs was decreased. However, when AlF4− was added after Cu2+ or Zn2+, the GDP associated with Gαs was minimal and the same as that in the presence of Cu2+ or Zn2+ alone (Fig. 6). These findings (Fig. 6) demonstrate that the AlF4− does not facilitate the re-association of the GDP that has been released from Gαs by Cu2+ or Zn2+. Thus, the data in Fig. 6 support the notion that the ability of AlF4− to stimulate AC after treatment of the Gαs with Cu2+ or Zn2+ (Fig. 5) is independent of GDP reassociation to the G protein and most likely due to the ability of AlF4− to mimic the γ-phosphate of GTP and alter the conformation of the nucleotide-free Gαs sufficiently to activate AC. An identical scenario has previously been presented for the nucleotide-free transducin and its partial activation by AlF4− to stimulate cGMP phosphodiesterase (38Bigay J. Deterre P. Pfister C. Chabre M. FEBS Lett. 1985; 191: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In this context, it should also be noted that studies from the Iyengar laboratory (39Chen Y. Yoo B. Lee J. Weng G. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45751-45754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) have shown that small peptides corresponding to the switch regions of Gαs can stimulate AC. Therefore, small and subtle changes in the switch regions of Gαs manifested by AlF4− binding in the absence of GDP may be sufficient to activate AC. Interestingly, the guanine nucleotide-free state of Gαs induced by Cu2+ or Zn2+ appears to be different from the guanine nucleotide-free form of Gαi that is induced by activated receptors or guanine nucleotide exchange factors such as Ric-8 (40Tall G.G. Krumins A.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 8356-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the G protein can bind GTPγS (40Tall G.G. Krumins A.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 8356-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), whereas in the case of Cu2+ or Zn2+ pretreatment, the G protein loses the ability to bind GTPγS. Nevertheless, Cu2+ and Zn2+ provide a means by which a guanine nucleotide-free state of Gαs can be achieved to study the structure of this form of the G protein. Location of Cu2+ Binding Region on Gαs—To locate the possible Cu2+ binding site(s) on Gαs, we took the advantage of the fact that Cu2+ can catalyze the Fenton reaction in the presence of H2O2 and ascorbate and hydrolyze the peptide backbone at the Cu2+ binding site(s) (41Marx G. Chevion M. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Moreover, to determine the fragment sizes and whether the N or C terminus of Gαs was cleaved, we utilized one antibody that recognizes the anti-Xpress tag on the N terminus of the recombinant Gαs and another antibody against the last 10 amino acids of the G protein. As shown in Fig. 7 (A and B), incubation of Gαs with CuSO4, ascorbate, and H2O2 for 10 min resulted in the cleavage of Gαs, and as determined with the N-terminal antibody, the appearance of a new band that migrated as a 39- to 40-kDa protein. In control reactions, no cleavage was observed in the absence of ascorbate (lane 2, Fig. 7A). Interestingly, Western analysis of the cleaved Gαs with the C-terminal anti-Gαs antibody did not detect the smaller band that migrated as a 39- to 40-kDa protein (Fig. 7B). These data (Fig. 7, A and B) show that the cleavage site is at the C terminus of Gαs. Moreover, the data in Fig. 7B show that Cu2+ by itself does not alter the migration of Gαs and that longer (1 h) incubation of the G protein in the presence of ascorbate and H2O2 results in near complete degradation. Notably, we did not observe any protective effect of GTPγS against the Cu2+-mediated cleavage in the Fenton reaction (not shown) demonstrating that, although Cu2+ does not alter the ability of the GTPγS-bound form of Gαs to stimulate AC activity (Fig. 5), the divalent cation can still bind to the GTPγS-bound form of Gαs. Based on the approximate molecular weight of the cleaved band (from its migration on SDS-PAGE gels) we propose that the potential cleavage site is located in the region encompassed by amino acid residues 310–330 (numbering according to the long form of Gαs) (Fig. 7C). This region is on the opposite side of switches 1, 2, and 3 and AC binding site on Gαs (7Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This region (amino acids 310–330) has also been shown to be the dimerization site in the Gαs crystal structure (7Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, whether Gαs forms dimers in vivo and whether this dimerization is of functional significance are presently not clear. Receptor-mediated Activation of AC Is More Sensitive to Inhibition by Zn2+ Than Forskolin-stimulated AC—Zn2+ has been demonstrated to inhibit certain isoforms of AC, including ACVI (22Klein C. Sunahara R.K. Hudson T.Y. Heyduk T. Howlett A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11859-11865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because our studies demonstrate that Zn2+ also inhibits Gαs activation, we determined the relative sensitivity of receptor-mediated stimulation of AC versus direct inhibition of the enzyme by Zn2+. For this purpose, membranes of S49 cells that express ACVI and ACVII (27Premont R.T. Jacobowitz O. Iyengar R. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used. Essentially, the ability of different concentrations of Zn2+ and Cu2+ to inhibit AC activity that was stimulated by either isoproterenol or forskolin was monitored. The data in Fig. 8A demonstrate that, as shown previously by Klein et al. (22Klein C. Sunahara R.K. Hudson T.Y. Heyduk T. Howlett A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11859-11865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Zn2+ inhibited forskolin-stimulated AC activity with an IC50 value of ∼5.5 μm. Likewise, Cu2+ also inhibited forskolin-stimulated AC activity with an IC50 value of ∼6 μm (Fig. 8B). However, isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity was more sensitive to inhibition by Zn2+ and Cu2+ as compared with forskolin-stimulated AC activity (Fig. 8, A and B). Thus, although Zn2+ and Cu2+ can inhibit AC activity directly, the additional inhibition at the level of the Gαs activation also plays a role in inhibiting AC activity in response to neurotransmitters or hormones. In fact, the inhibition of Gαs apparently occurs at much lower concentrations of the metal cations and, therefore, the more sensitive response of receptor-activated AC as compared with forskolin-stimulated AC activity. Notably, the IC50 value for Zn2+- and Cu2+-mediated inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity was ∼1.5 μm (Fig. 8) a value similar (∼2 μm) to that observed for inhibition of GTPγS binding to Gαs (Fig. 3B). Overall, these data (Fig. 8) are consistent with the notion that inhibition of Gαs function is one of the primary sites of Cu2+ and Zn2+ action in regulating receptor-mediated stimulation of AC. In conclusion, our data show that Cu2+ and Zn2+ dissociate the GDP that is bound to Gαs and that these divalent metal cations inhibit the binding of GTPγS to the G protein thus generating a nucleotide-free form of the G protein. Both of these effects render the G protein inactive as a stimulator of AC when Cu2+ and Zn2+ are added before GTP or GTPγS. However, once bound, GTPγS is not readily dissociated from the G protein by either Cu2+ or Zn2+, and, therefore, the G protein is capable of activating AC. Interestingly, AlF4− can partially restore the ability of Gαs to activate AC even after treatment of the G protein with the divalent metal cations. This effect of AlF4− is not dependent on the re-association of GDP with the G protein. Thus, AlF4− by itself is sufficient to alter the structure of the guanine nucleotide-free form of the Gαs induced by Cu2+ and Zn2+ to permit activation of AC. In this respect, this is the first evidence to show the presence of a nucleotide-free form of Gαs and that the γ-phosphate of GTP may be sufficient to alter the structure of Gαs sufficiently to stimulate AC. We also show that the Cu2+ interaction site on Gαs is in the C terminus of the G protein and is most likely located between amino acid residues 310–330. Finally, by modulating the activity of Gαs, Cu2+ and Zn2+ can interfere with the regulation of AC activity by hormones and neurotransmitters that mediate their actions via GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors."

In combination with the stopped-flow method, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between probes attached to Cys-60 or Cys-250 of TnT and Cys-374 of actin was measured to determine the rates of switching movement of the troponin tail domain (Cys-60) and of the TnT-TnI coiled-coil C terminus (Cys-250) between three states (relaxed, closed, and open) of the thin filament. When the free Ca2+ concentration was rapidly changed, these domains moved with rates of ∼450 and ∼85 s–1 at pH 7.0 on Ca2+ up and down, respectively. When myosin subfragment 1 (S1) was dissociated from thin filaments by rapid mixing with ATP, these domains moved with a single rate constant of ∼400 s–1 in the presence and absence of Ca2+. The light scattering measurements showed that ATP-induced S1 dissociation occurred with a rate constant >800 s–1. When S1 was rapidly mixed with the thin filament, these domains moved with almost the same or slightly faster rates than those of S1 binding measured by light scattering. In most but not all aspects, the rates of movement of the troponin tail domain and of the TnT-TnI coiled-coil C terminus were very similar to those of certain TnI sites (N terminus, Cys-133, and C terminus) previously characterized (Shitaka, Y., Kimura, C., Iio, T., and Miki, M.

Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Tm, an extended α-helical coiled-coil dimmer, binds end to end along the actin filament and covers seven actin monomers. Tn is a complex of three proteins: TnC, TnI, and TnT. TnI inhibits actin-myosin interaction, and TnC suppresses the inhibitory effect of TnI by binding Ca2+. TnT binds to Tm and integrates the whole Tn complex into the thin filament. The extended N-terminal domain of TnT interacts with Tm in a Ca2+-independent manner, whereas the C-terminal domain forms globular domain with other troponin subunits (TnI and TnC) and interacts with Tm in a Ca2+-dependent manner (3Onoyama Y. Ohtsuki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding to TnC triggers a series of conformational changes of thin filaments, and then the active cross-bridge cycle is turned on (4Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J.,. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 5Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Early explanation for the regulation mechanism is that the skeletal muscle thin filament has two states, “on” and “off” states depending on Ca2+ concentrations. Recent kinetic studies proposed an additional state of the thin filament induced by the strong binding of myosin. Instead of a two-state model based on Ca2+-induced on-off switching, a three-state model has been proposed in which a thin filament exists in rapid equilibrium between three states, “blocked,” “closed,” and “open” (6Mckillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The equilibrium between the blocked and closed states is calcium-sensitive, and strong myosin binding stabilizes the open state. Structural studies, such as three-dimensional image reconstructions of electron micrographs and x-ray diffraction, have shown three positions of Tm corresponding to three states of the thin filament (7Holmes K.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2-7PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear whether the conformational change observed by both x-ray and three-dimensional image reconstructions of electron micrographs measurements could be entirely attributed to movement of Tm or to a change in the Tn position and/or in actin structure (9Squire J.M. Morris E.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) also provides structural information based on distances between probes attached to specific residues on proteins. This method can easily detect a conformational change in tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins because the transfer efficiency is a function of the inverse of the sixth power of the distance between probes. FRET between probes attached to TnI and actin showed a significant extent of Ca2+-induced and also S1-induced movement of TnI on the reconstituted thin filament (10Miki M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Tao T. Gong B.J. Leavis P.C. Science. 1990; 247: 1339-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Miki M. Kobayashi T.

Not only TnI but also TnT changes positions on the actin filament corresponding to three states of the thin filament (15Kimura C. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The movements of TnI and TnT between three states are impaired on the thin filament reconstituted with a functionally deficient mutant Tm (D234Tm) (14Hai H. Sano K. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Kimura C. Maeda K. Hai H. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). D234Tm, in which three of seven repeats have been deleted, inhibits actomyosin-MgATPase even in the presence of Ca2+ and Tn (17Landis C.A. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14051-14056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The transitions between three positions of TnI and TnT on the thin filament are closely related to the regulation mechanism. Thus, FRET measurements provided a structural evidence for three states of thin filament (14Hai H. Sano K. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Kimura C. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem.

The local dissociation of TnI from actin was demonstrated by use of the excimer fluorescence of pyrene-labeled Tm (18Zhou X. Morris E.P. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TnI and TnI-TnC (–Ca2+) bind to the closed state of actin-Tm, and their binding is greatly weakened in the S1-induced open state. For better understanding of the regulation mechanism, it is important to know the transition rates between the three states of thin filaments. Numerous stopped-flow measurements have been carried out to study the kinetics of the conformational change of the thin filament (19Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 19: 1102-1110Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Maytum R.

In these experiments, fluorescent probes were attached to Tm or actin, and the time course of the fluorescence intensity change was traced for kinetic studies of conformational changes of Tm and actin in response to three states of thin filaments. However, the fluorescence intensity change measured in these experiments indicates some environmental change around the probe, but it does not necessary mean a spatial rearrangement of thin filaments. On the other hand, the change in the transfer efficiency of FRET indicates a spatial rearrangement of thin filaments. The change in the transfer efficiency of FRET between probes attached to TnI and actin was monitored by donor fluorescence intensity to determine the rates of Ca2+- and S1-induced movements of TnI on the reconstituted thin filament (23Miki M. Iio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7101-7106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Shitaka Y. Kimura C. Iio T. Miki M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10739-10747Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present study, the rates of Ca2+- and S1-induced movements of TnT were determined by measuring FRET between probes attached to Cys-374 of actin and Cys-60 or Cys-250 of the point-mutated TnT25k fragment on the reconstituted thin filaments. Cys-60 is located on the troponin tail domain, and Cys-250 is on the globular domain. As compared with the rate constants of S1 binding or dissociation determined by light scattering measurements, these measurements provide a better understanding for a switching mechanism by Tn in striated muscle regulation. Reagents—Phalloidin from Amanita phalloides was purchased from Sigma. IAEDANS and DABMI were purchased from Molecular Probes. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Proteins—Actin, S1, and Tn were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as reported previously (10Miki M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ααTm was extracted from rabbit hearts as reported previously (10Miki M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Single cysteine TnT25k mutants (E60C and S250C) were prepared as reported previously (15Kimura C. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Actin was labeled at Cys-374 with DABMI as mentioned previously (14Hai H. Sano K. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The Tn complex labeled at Cys-133 of TnI with AEDANS (AEDANS-I133-Tn) was prepared as previously reported (14Hai H. Sano K. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TnT25k mutants were labeled with IAEDANS, and reconstitution of ternary Tn complexes with AEDANS-labeled TnT25k mutants (AEDANS-T60-Tn and AEDANS-T250-Tn) was carried out as reported previously (15Kimura C. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cys-60 is located at the second residue from the N terminus, and Cys-250 is located at the seventeenth residue from the C terminus of the 25-kDa fragment of TnT. ATPase measurements indicated that Tn complexes reconstituted with the AEDANS-labeled TnT25k mutants retained the regulatory activity as well as the wild-type Tn (15Kimura C. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For stopped-flow measurements, equimolar phalloidin to actin was added to stabilize the actin filament. Spectroscopic Measurements—Absorption was measured with a Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer. Steady state fluorescence was measured with a PerkinElmer LS50B fluorometer. Protein concentrations were determined by use of absorption coefficients of A290 nm = 0.63 (mg/ml)–1 cm–1 for G-actin, A280 nm = 0.24 for Tm, 0.45 for Tn, and 0.67 (mg/ml) –1 cm–1 for TnT25k. The concentration of labeled protein was measured with the BCA protein assay reagent by using the nonlabeled protein as the standard. Relative molecular masses of 42 kDa for actin, 66 kDa for Tm, and 64 kDa for reconstituted Tn with TnT25k mutants were used. The absorption coefficients of 24,800 m–1 cm–1 at 460 nm for DABMI (25Lamkin M. Tao T. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and 6100 m–1 cm–1 at 337 nm for IAEDANS (26Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) were used to determine the labeling ratios. The typical labeling ratios were 1.0 for DAB-F-actin, 0.75 for AEDANS-T250-Tn, and 0.74 for AEDANS-T60-Tn. pCa values were calculated from the concentrations of added EGTA and CaCl2 using the numerical constants of Schwarzenbach et al. (27Schwarzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1957; 40: 1886-1900Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Measurements—Kinetic measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics Ltd. Model SX.18 MV stoppedflow spectrofluorometer. The excitation monochromator was set at 340 nm for fluorescence or 500 nm for the light scattering measurements, and the light from 420–540 nm was collected through a broad band cut filter (Chroma Technology Co.) placed at the emission side. The instrumental dead time was 1.63 ms under the present experimental conditions. For each experiment, the reaction curves are the average of 10 reaction traces. The data were fitted with a nonlinear least-squares procedure to a single or a double exponential expression from which the rate constants were calculated. Prior to the stopped-flow experiments, the pH of the protein sample solutions were adjusted to the experimental values, and the pH of the mixing buffer solutions (Ca2+ or EGTA solutions) was adjusted by KOH to give the values of the experimental pH after rapid mixing with the protein solutions. Data sets were fit to the single and double exponential equation with a floating end point using the Applied Photophysics Ltd. SX.18MV kinetic spectrometer work station software and Microsoft Excel. Ca2+-dependent Conformational Change—In the present study, IAEDANS attached to Cys-60 or Cys-250 of TnT was used as the FRET donor, and DABMI attached to Cys-374 of actin was as the energy acceptor. From steady-state fluorescence measurements, we reported previously that a large difference in the transfer efficiency between these donor and acceptor probes was observed between the presence and absence of Ca2+ (15Kimura C. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The change in the transfer efficiency upon Ca2+ binding corresponds to the increase in the distance by 3.6 Å for AEDANS-T60-Tn and 7 Å for AEDANS-T250-Tn (15Kimura C. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This Ca2+-dependent conformational change was measured by changing the free Ca2+ concentrations. Fig. 1 shows the fluorescence titration curves of AEDANS-T250-Tn/Tm/DAB-F-actin (in the presence of the acceptor) and AEDANS-T250-Tn/Tm/F-actin (in the absence of the acceptor) as a function of the free Ca2+ concentration. The curve in the presence of the acceptor (FRET) shows a large increase in the donor fluorescence with increasing free Ca2+ concentration, whereas the curve in the absence of acceptor shows a decrease in the donor fluorescence. The curve of FRET shows a very sharp transition with a midpoint at pCa 6.6. The results indicate that the rearrangement of the spatial relationship between TnT and actin in reconstituted thin filaments occurs with a highly cooperative mode. The change in FRET between probes attached to TnT and actin directly reflects the change of the physiological conditions of the reconstituted thin filament (i.e. active and inhibitory states).Fig. 4Stopped-flow traces for the S1-induced TnT (E60C) movement in the presence of Ca2+ on the reconstituted thin filament.

The change in the transfer efficiency after changing the solvent conditions from –Ca2+ to +Ca2+ (or vice versa) was monitored by the donor-fluorescence intensity in the presence (Fig. 2, A and C) and absence (Fig. 2, B and D) of the acceptor. The reconstituted thin filament in 30 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaN3, and 20 mm MOPS or 20 mm MES (buffer A) with 0.5 mm EGTA (buffer A–Ca) or 0.1 mm CaCl2 (buffer A+Ca) was mixed with the same volume of buffer A containing 4 mm CaCl2 or 3.75 mm EGTA, respectively. Fig. 2, A and C, shows the time courses of the fluorescence intensity of AEDANS-T250-Tn/Tm/DAB-F-actin after changing Ca2+ concentrations at pH 7.0. From –Ca2+ to +Ca2+ (Fig. 2A), the fluorescence intensity increased (the transfer efficiency decreased) very rapidly and reached a final fluorescence level within 10 ms after the flowstop point. The observed fluorescence intensity change was analyzed by a single exponential process with the rate constant of 376 ± 56 s–1. From +Ca2+ to –Ca2+ (Fig. 2C) the fluorescence intensity decreased with the rate constant of 91.0 ± 14 s–1. On the other hand, Fig. 2, B and D, shows the time courses of the fluorescence intensity of AEDANS-T250-Tn/Tm/F-actin (in the absence of the acceptor) after changing Ca2+ concentrations at pH 7.0. Contrary to the case in the presence of the acceptor, the fluorescence intensity decreased with the rate constant of 345 ± 38 s–1 from –Ca2+ to +Ca2+ (Fig. 2B) and increased with the rate constant of 85.9 ± 10 s–1 from +Ca2+ to –Ca2+ (Fig. 2D). The time courses of fluorescence intensity changes were followed at pH 7.5, 6.5, and 6.0. From –Ca2+ to +Ca2+, the fluorescence intensity of AEDANS-T250-Tn/Tm/DAB-F-actin increased with rate constants of 641 ± 96 s–1 at pH 7.5, 208 ± 31 s–1 at pH 6.5, and 151 ± 23 s–1 at pH 6.0. On the other hand, from +Ca2+ to –Ca2+ the fluorescence intensity of AE-DANS-T250-Tn/Tm/DAB-F-actin decreased with rate constants of 83.1.0 ± 12 s–1 at pH 7.5, 109 ± 16 s–1 at pH 6.5, and 150 ± 23 s–1 at pH 6.0. The rate constants of Ca2+-induced TnT movement strongly depended on the pH. As the pH decreased, the transition rate from –Ca2+ to +Ca2+ became slower, but the reverse rate became faster. The same measurements using AEDANS-T60-Tn and AEDANS-I133-Tn were carried out at pH 7.5, 7.0, 6.5, and 6.0. The results were summarized in Fig. 3. Kinetics of S1-induced Movement of TnT—According to the three-state model of thin filaments, rigor S1 binding to the regulated thin filament induces the open state (6Mckillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Steady-state FRET measurements showed that the transfer efficiency between probes attached to Cys-60 or Cys-250 of the TnT25k mutant and Cys-374 or Gln-41 of actin in the reconstituted thin filament decreases significantly by rigor S1 binding (15Kimura C. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Miki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the absence of the acceptor, the donor fluorescence did not change appreciably by rigor S1 binding. The change in the transfer efficiency was monitored by the donor-fluorescence intensity in the presence of the acceptor. Using AEDANS-T60-Tn and DAB-F-actin, time courses of the light scattering and fluorescence intensity changes of the reconstituted thin filament were followed after S1 binding or dissociation in the presence of Ca2+ (transition from the closed to open states or vice versa) (Fig. 4). In the case of S1 dissociation, the reconstituted thin filaments and S1 complex in 30 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, and 1 mm NaN3 (buffer F) with 0.1 mm CaCl2 (buffer F+Ca) was mixed with the same volume of buffer F+Ca including 1.0 mm ATP at 20 °C. The light scattering intensity decreased very rapidly and reached the final level at ∼4 ms after the flow-stop point. The observed light scattering intensity change was only ∼20% of the total change under the present experimental conditions. The whole process of the light scattering change was regarded as a single exponential process and fitted with the rate constant of 975 ± 107 s–1 (Fig. 4, A (1)), although such fast rate is near the limitation of the present instrumental conditions (dead time of 1.63 ms). On the other hand, the fluorescence intensity decreased much slower than the light scattering intensity (Fig. 4, A (2)), and the trace was analyzed by a single exponential curve with the rate constant of 372 ± 48 s–1. In the case of S1 binding, the reconstituted thin filament in 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, and 1 mm NaN3 (buffer F′) with 0.1 mm CaCl2 (buffer F′+Ca) was mixed with the same volume of S1 in buffer F′+Ca at 20 °C. When S1 was mixed with thin filaments, the fluorescence intensity increased slightly faster than the light scattering intensity (Fig. 4B). The curves were analyzed by a single exponential process with the rate constants of 10.3 ± 1.3 s–1 for light scattering (curve 1) and 12.2 ± 1.6 s–1 for fluorescence (curve 2). Time courses of the light scattering and fluorescence intensity changes of the reconstituted thin filament after S1 binding or dissociation were followed also in the absence of Ca2+ (transition from the relaxed to open states or vice versa). In the case of S1 dissociation (Fig. 5A), the reconstituted thin filament and S1 complex in buffer F with 1.0 mm EGTA (buffer F–Ca) was mixed with the same volume of buffer F–Ca including 1.0 mm ATP at 20 °C. The light scattering intensity decreased as rapidly as the case in the presence of Ca2+, and the trace was fitted by a single exponential process with the rate constant of 888 ± 98 s–1 (Fig. 5A (1)). On the other hand, the fluorescence intensity (Fig. 5A (2)) decreased much slower than the light scattering intensity, and the curve was analyzed by a single exponential process with the rate constant of 407 ± 53 s–1. In the case of S1 binding, the reconstituted thin filament in buffer F′ with 1.0 mm EGTA (buffer F′–Ca) was mixed with the same volume of S1 in buffer F′–Ca at 20 °C. When S1 was mixed with thin filaments, the fluorescence intensity increased slightly faster than the light scattering intensity (Fig. 5B). The curves were fitted by a single exponential process with the rate constants of 4.5 ± 0.6 s–1 for light scattering (curve 1) and 5.9 ± 0.7 s–1 for fluorescence (curve 2). The values were approximately half of the rate constants in the presence of Ca2+. Using AEDANS-T250-Tn and DAB-F-actin, time courses of the light scattering and fluorescence intensity change of the reconstituted thin filaments after S1 binding and dissociation were also followed under the same experimental conditions as AEDANS-T60-Tn. Almost the same results were obtained.

Stopped-flow measurements were carried out under the same experimental conditions as shown in Figs. 4A and 5A except for the concentration of ATP. Time courses of the light scattering and fluorescence intensity changes were analyzed with a single exponential process both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. Fig. 6 shows the rate constant versus the ATP concentration in the presence and absence of Ca2+. The rate constant of the light scattering intensity change (dissociation of S1 from the thin filament) increased markedly as the ATP concentration increased up to 0.5 mm, irrespective of the presence or absence of Ca2+. On the other hand, the rate constant of the fluorescence intensity change increased as the ATP concentration increased up to 0.25 mm but did not change at more than 0.25 mm ATP. Using time-resolved FRET between probes attached to Cys-374 of actin and positions 1, 133, or 181 of TnI, we measured the switching rates of TnI between the three states of thin filaments (24Shitaka Y. Kimura C. Iio T. Miki M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10739-10747Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present study, probes were attached to positions 60 and 250 on TnT25k fragment and Cys-374 on actin, and time-resolved FRET was measured to determine the switching rates of TnT between the three states of thin filaments. Ca2+-induced Movement of TnT—In contrast to"
https://openalex.org/W2021261000,"Loss of p27Kip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is observed in aggressive prostate cancers. We demonstrated that intratumoral injections of recombinant adenovirus overexpressing p27Kip1 (Adp27) reduced the growth of prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice. Presently, we studied the mechanism(s) of cell death induced by Adp27 in prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Cells were infected with Adp27 and compared with those infected by empty virus or were non-infected. Cell cycle and typical markers of apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry in the presence of the following reagents: cycloheximide, pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk, neutralizing anti-TNFR1, and anti-TNFR2. Overexpression of p27Kip1 protein and cell cycle arrest were noted within 24 h after Adp27-infection. Sub-G1 fraction, chromatin margination, and phosphatidylserine exposure were evident by the third day of treatment. Cycloheximide elevated sub-G1 fraction in Adp27-infected cells by threefold, while ZVAD-fmk reduced sub-G1 to control levels. Caspase-dependent apoptosis occurred in a third of the population, while two-thirds were ZVAD-fmk insensitive but TUNEL-positive. Flow cytometry showed increased expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in Adp27-infected cells. Neutralizing anti-TNFR1 decreased TUNEL-positive score, while anti-TNFR2 did not affect p27Kip1-induced apoptosis. This is the first report showing that p27Kip1 induces caspase-dependent and -independent stages of cell death that may involve TNF-signaling through TNFR1."
