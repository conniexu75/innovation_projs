https://openalex.org/W2985591769,"Gene expression can be activated or suppressed using CRISPR­–Cas9 systems. However, tools that enable dose-dependent activation of gene expression without the use of exogenous transcription regulatory proteins are lacking. Here we describe chemical epigenetic modifiers (CEMs) designed to activate the expression of target genes by recruiting components of the endogenous chromatin-activating machinery, eliminating the need for exogenous transcriptional activators. The system has two parts: catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) in complex with FK506-binding protein (FKBP) and a CEM consisting of FK506 linked to a molecule that interacts with cellular epigenetic machinery. We show that CEMs upregulate gene expression at target endogenous loci up to 20-fold or more depending on the gene. We also demonstrate dose-dependent control of transcriptional activation, function across multiple diverse genes, reversibility of CEM activity and specificity of our best-in-class CEM across the genome.

https://openalex.org/W2989479224,"Acquisition and extinction of learned fear responses utilize conserved but flexible neural circuits. Here we show that acquisition of conditioned freezing behavior is associated with dynamic remodeling of relative excitatory drive from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) away from corticotropin releasing factor-expressing (CRF+) centrolateral amygdala neurons, and toward non-CRF+ (CRF−) and somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) neurons, while fear extinction training remodels this circuit back toward favoring CRF+ neurons. Importantly, BLA activity is required for this experience-dependent remodeling, while directed inhibition of the BLA–centrolateral amygdala circuit impairs both fear memory acquisition and extinction memory retrieval. Additionally, ectopic excitation of CRF+ neurons impairs fear memory acquisition and facilities extinction, whereas CRF+ neuron inhibition impairs extinction memory retrieval, supporting the notion that CRF+ neurons serve to inhibit learned freezing behavior. These data suggest that afferent-specific dynamic remodeling of relative excitatory drive to functionally distinct subcortical neuronal output populations represents an important mechanism underlying experience-dependent modification of behavioral selection. Hartley et al. report the bidirectional remodeling of a basolateral amygdala-to-central amygdala neural circuit, where input onto corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-expressing and CRF-negative neurons is shaped by the acquisition and extinction of fear memory."
https://openalex.org/W2986520318,"Background Musculoskeletal pain conditions incur high costs and produce significant personal and public health consequences, including disability and opioid-related mortality. Persistence of high-cost health care utilization for musculoskeletal pain may help identify system inefficiencies that could limit value of care. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with persistent high-cost utilization among individuals seeking health care for musculoskeletal pain. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data (2008–2013) that included a non-institutionalized, population-based sample of individuals seeking health care for a musculoskeletal pain condition (n = 12,985). Expenditures associated with musculoskeletal pain conditions over two consecutive years were analyzed from prescribed medicine, office-based medical provider visits, outpatient department visits, emergency room visits, inpatient hospital stays, and home health visits. Persistent high-cost utilization was defined as being in the top 15th percentile for annual musculoskeletal pain-related expenditures over 2 consecutive years. We used multinomial regression to determine which modifiable and non-modifiable sociodemographic, health, and pain-related variables were associated with persistent high-cost utilization. Results Approximately 35% of direct costs for musculoskeletal pain were concentrated among the 4% defined as persistent high-cost utilizers. Non-modifiable variables associated with expenditure group classification included age, race, poverty level, geographic region, insurance status, diagnosis type and total number of musculoskeletal pain diagnoses. Modifiable variables associated with increased risk of high expenditure classification were higher number of missed work days, greater pain interference, and higher use of prescription medication for pain, while higher self-reported physical and mental health were associated with lower risk of high expenditure classification. Conclusions Health care delivery models that prospectively identify these potentially modifiable factors may improve the costs and value of care for individuals with musculoskeletal pain prone to risk for high-cost care episodes."
https://openalex.org/W2986303586,"The opportunistic pathogen Escherichia coli, a common member of the human gut microbiota belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, is the causative agent of the majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The gut microbiota serves as a reservoir for uropathogenic E. coli where they are shed in feces, colonize the periurethral area, and infect the urinary tract. Currently, front line treatment for UTIs consists of oral antibiotics, but the rise of antibiotic resistance is leading to higher rates of recurrence, and antibiotics cause collateral damage to other members of the gut microbiota. It is commonly believed that incorporation of the American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, into the diet is useful for reducing recurrence of UTIs. We hypothesized such a benefit might be explained by a prebiotic or antimicrobial effect on the gut microbiota. As such, we tested cranberry extracts and whole cranberry powder on a human gut microbiome-derived community in a gut simulator and found that cranberry components broadly modulate the microbiota by reducing the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and increasing the abundance of Bacteroidaceae. To identify the specific compounds responsible for this, we tested a panel of compounds isolated from cranberries for activity against E. coli, and found that salicylate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both laboratory E. coli and human UTI E. coli isolates. In a gut simulator, salicylate reduced levels of Enterobacteriaceae and elevated Bacteroidaceae in a dose dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2987428619,"Dysfunctional mitochondria have been implicated in aging and age-related disorders such as Parkinson's diseases (PD). We previously showed that pink1 and parkin, two familial PD genes, function in a linear pathway to maintain mitochondrial integrity and function. Studies of mammalian cell lines also suggest that these genes regulate mitochondrial autophagy(mitophagy). Overexpressing Parkin promotes proteostasis and function of aged muscles both in fruit flies and mice, and recent studies also indicated that mitochondrial ubiquitination are accumulated in aged muscles. However, the underlying mechanisms for pink1 and parkin mediated mitophagy on longevity is not fully understood. Here, we found that mitochondrial ubiquitination increased in indirect flight muscles (IFMs) in an age-dependent manner. Overexpression of pink1 or parkin in IFMs can abolish mitochondrial ubiquitination, restore ATP level and extend lifespan, while blocking autophagy via ATG1 knock-down suppress these effects in aged IFMs. Taken together, these results show that pink1/parkin promotes mitophagy of mitochondrial ubiquitination in aged muscles and extend lifespan in an Atg1-dependent manner. Our study provides physiological evidence that mitophagy of mitochondrial ubiquitination mediated by PINK1/ Parkin is crucial for muscle function and highlights the role of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases like PD."

Its efficacy for the treatment of type 1 diabetes has not been explored, in part because the nerves projecting to the pancreatic lymph nodes (pLNs) in mice are unmapped. Here, we map the nerve projecting to the pancreas and pLNs in mice and use a minimally invasive surgical procedure to implant micro-cuff electrodes onto the nerve. Pancreatic nerve electrical stimulation (PNES) resulted in β-adrenergic receptor-mediated-accumulation of B and T cells in pLNs and reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines following lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Autoreactive T cells showed reduced proliferation in pLNs of mice receiving PNES as compared to sham controls. In a spontaneous mouse model of autoimmune diabetes, PNES inhibited disease progression in diabetic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2983692475,"Bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP10) is a cardiac peptide growth factor belonging to the transforming growth factor β superfamily that critically controls cardiovascular development, growth, and maturation. It has been shown that BMP10 elicits its intracellular signaling through a receptor complex of activin receptor-like kinase 1 with morphogenetic protein receptor type II or activin receptor type 2A. Previously, we generated and characterized a transgenic mouse line expressing BMP10 from the α-myosin heavy chain gene promoter and found that these mice have normal cardiac hypertrophic responses to both physiological and pathological stimuli. In this study, we report that these transgenic mice exhibit significantly reduced levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis in response to a prolonged administration of the β-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol. We further confirmed this cardioprotective function with a newly generated conditional Bmp10 transgenic mouse line, in which Bmp10 was activated in adult hearts by tamoxifen. Moreover, the intraperitoneal administration of recombinant human BMP10 was found to effectively protect hearts from injury, suggesting potential therapeutic utility of using BMP10 to prevent heart failure. Gene profiling and biochemical analyses indicated that BMP10 activates the SMAD-mediated canonical pathway and, unexpectedly, also the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)–mediated signaling pathway both in vivo and in vitro. Additional findings further supported the notion that BMP10's cardioprotective function likely is due to its dual activation of SMAD- and STAT3-regulated signaling pathways, promoting cardiomyocyte survival and suppressing cardiac fibrosis.

https://openalex.org/W2986482640,"In cancer, aberrant growth factor receptor signaling reprograms cellular metabolism and global gene transcription to drive aggressive growth, but the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. Here we show that in the highly lethal brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM), mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), a critical core component of the growth factor signaling system, couples acetyl-CoA production with nuclear translocation of histone-modifying enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase and class IIa histone deacetylases to globally alter histone acetylation. Integrated analyses in orthotopic mouse models and in clinical GBM samples reveal that mTORC2 controls iron metabolisms via histone H3 acetylation of the iron-related gene promoter, promoting tumor cell survival. These results nominate mTORC2 as a critical epigenetic regulator of iron metabolism in cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2955267060,"The latent cellular reservoir of HIV is recognized as the major barrier to cure from HIV infection. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are more tissue and cell type-specific than protein coding genes, and may represent targets of choice for HIV latency reversal. Using two in vitro primary T-cell models, we identified lncRNAs dysregulated in latency. PVT1 and RP11-347C18.3 were up-regulated in common between the two models, and RP11-539L10.2 was down-regulated. The major component of the latent HIV reservoir, memory CD4+ T-cells, had higher expression of these lncRNAs, compared to naïve T-cells. Guilt-by-association analysis demonstrated that lncRNAs dysregulated in latency were associated with several cellular pathways implicated in HIV latency establishment and maintenance: proteasome, spliceosome, p53 signaling, and mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR). PVT1, RP11-347C18.3, and RP11-539L10.2 were down-regulated by latency reversing agents, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and Romidepsin, suggesting that modulation of lncRNAs is a possible secondary mechanism of action of these compounds. These results will facilitate prioritization of lncRNAs for evaluation as targets for HIV latency reversal. Importantly, our study provides insights into regulatory function of lncRNA during latent HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2982725864,"The ferric iron uptake (Fiu) transporter from Escherichia coli functions in the transport of iron–catecholate complexes across the bacterial outer membrane, providing the bacterium with iron, which is essential for growth. Recently it has become clear that Fiu also represents a liability for E. coli because its activity allows import of antimicrobial compounds that mimic catecholate. This inadvertent import suggests the potential utility of antimicrobial catechol siderophore mimetics in managing bacterial infections. However, to fully exploit these compounds, a detailed understanding of the mechanism of transport through Fiu and related transporters is required. To address this question, we determined the crystal structure of Fiu at 2.1–2.9 Å and analyzed its function in E. coli. Through analysis of the Fiuo crystal structure, in combination with in silico docking and mutagenesis, we provide insight into how Fiu and related transporters bind catecholate in a surface-exposed cavity. Moreover, through determination of the structure of Fiu in multiple crystal states, we revealed the presence of a large, selectively gated cavity in the interior of this transporter. This chamber is large enough to accommodate the Fiu substrate and may allow import of substrates via a two-step mechanism. This would avoid channel formation through the transporter and inadvertent import of toxic molecules. As Fiu and its homologs are the targets of substrate-mimicking antibiotics, these results may assist in the development of these compounds.

https://openalex.org/W2987138161,"High-density aquaculture and nutritional imbalances may promote fatty liver in genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT, Oreochromis niloticus), thus reducing the gains achieved by breeding. In this study, apple peel powder (APP) was used as a feed additive for GIFT. A control group (fed on a diet without APP) and five groups fed on diets supplemented with APP (at 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, or 0.8% of the diet, by weight) were established to investigate the effects of APP on GIFT growth performance and physiological parameters, and on gene expression as determined by transcriptomic analysis. Dietary supplementation with APP at 0.2% promoted GIFT growth, reduced total cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in the serum and liver, and decreased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities in the serum. Gene expression profiles in the liver were compared among the control, 0.2% APP, and 0.8% APP groups, and differentially expressed genes among these groups were identified. Annotation analyses using tools at the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in the regulation of immunity and fat metabolism. The results showed that excessive supplementation with APP in the diet significantly inhibited the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein, and stimulated the expression of fatty acid desaturase 2, heat shock protein 90 beta family member 1, and nuclear factor kappa B. This resulted in disordered lipid metabolism and increased pro-inflammatory reactions, which in turn caused liver damage. Therefore, APP has good potential as an environmentally friendly feed additive for GIFT at levels of 0.1%-0.2% in the diet, but excessive amounts can have adverse effects."
https://openalex.org/W2985085437,"Expression of insulin and its receptor (IR) in rodent taste cells has been proposed, but exactly which types of taste cells express IR and the function of insulin signaling in taste organ have yet to be determined. In this study, we analyzed expression of IR mRNA and protein in mouse taste bud cells in vivo and explored its function ex vivo in organoids, using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative PCR. In mouse taste tissue, IR was expressed broadly in taste buds, including in type II and III taste cells. With using 3-D taste bud organoids, we found insulin in the culture medium significantly decreased the number of taste cell and mRNA expression levels of many taste cell genes, including nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-2 (NTPDase2), Tas1R3 (T1R3), gustducin, carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4), glucose transporter-8 (GLUT8), and sodium-glucose cotransporter-1 (SGLT1) in a concentration-dependent manner. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, diminished insulin’s effects and increase taste cell generation. Altogether, circulating insulin might be an important regulator of taste cell growth and/or proliferation via activation of the mTOR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2986606052,"Interferences and accuracy problem are one of the most talked issues in today's world for sensor technology. To deal with this contention, a microstrip framework consisting of a dual mode double negative (DNG) metamaterial based bandpass filter is presented in this article. To obtain the ultimate noise reduction bandpass filter, the proposed structure has to go through a series of development process, where the characteristics of the structure are tested to the limit. This filter is built on Rogers RT-5880 substrate with a 50Ω microstrip line. To pursue the elementary mode of resonant frequency, the ground layer of the structure is kept partially filled and a gradual analysis is executed on the prospective metamaterial (resonator) unit cell. Depending on the developed unit cell, the filter is constructed and fabricated to verify the concept, concentrating on GPS (1.55GHz), Earth Exploration-Satellite (2.70GHz) and WiMAX (3.60GHz) bands of frequencies. Moreover, the structure is investigated using Nicolson-Ross-Weir (NRW) approach to justify the metamaterial characteristics, and also tested on S-parameters, current distribution, electric and magnetic fields and quality factor. Having a propitious architecture and DNG characteristics, the proposed structure is suitable for bandpass filter for GPS, Earth Exploration-Satellite and WiMAX frequency sensing applications."
https://openalex.org/W2988461472,"The reverse transcriptases (RTs) encoded by mobile group II introns and other non-LTR retroelements differ from retroviral RTs in being able to template-switch efficiently from the 5′ end of one template to the 3′ end of another with little or no complementarity between the donor and acceptor templates. Here, to establish a complete kinetic framework for the reaction and to identify conditions that more efficiently capture acceptor RNAs or DNAs, we used a thermostable group II intron RT (TGIRT; GsI–IIC RT) that can template switch directly from synthetic RNA template/DNA primer duplexes having either a blunt end or a 3′-DNA overhang end. We found that the rate and amplitude of template switching are optimal from starter duplexes with a single nucleotide 3′-DNA overhang complementary to the 3′ nucleotide of the acceptor RNA, suggesting a role for nontemplated nucleotide addition of a complementary nucleotide to the 3′ end of cDNAs synthesized from natural templates. Longer 3′-DNA overhangs progressively decreased the template-switching rate, even when complementary to the 3′ end of the acceptor template. The reliance on only a single bp with the 3′ nucleotide of the acceptor together with discrimination against mismatches and the high processivity of group II intron RTs enable synthesis of full-length DNA copies of nucleic acids beginning directly at their 3′ end. We discuss the possible biological functions of the template-switching activity of group II intron- and other non-LTR retroelement–encoded RTs, as well as the optimization of this activity for adapter addition in RNA- and DNA-Seq protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2984484960,"CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) have been shown to regulate a variety of environmental stress-related signalling pathways in plants. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv) is known worldwide as a relatively stress-tolerant C4 crop species. Although the foxtail millet genome sequence has been released, little is known about the functions of CIPKs in foxtail millet. Therefore, a systematic genome-wide analysis of CIPK genes in foxtail millet was performed. In total, 35 CIPK members were identified in foxtail millet and divided into four subgroups (I to IV) on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic and gene structure analyses clearly divided all SiCIPKs into intron-poor and intron-rich clades. Cis-element analysis subsequently indicated that these SiCIPKs may be involved in responses to abiotic stimuli, hormones, and light signalling during plant growth and development, and stress-induced expression profile analysis revealed that all the SiCIPKs are involved in various stress signalling pathways. These results suggest that the CIPK genes in foxtail millet exhibit the basic characteristics of CIPK family members and play important roles in response to abiotic stresses. The results of this study will contribute to future functional characterization of abiotic stress responses mediated by CIPKs in foxtail millet."

Study 2 then utilized this methodology to examine two full-time recruitment staff trained in the use of concurrent verbal reporting before undertaking a live, in-game task. Participants also participated in a debrief interview following the game. The findings of the two studies suggest that developing a verbal reporting protocol is viable, however when applied in a live-game environment it is problematic. Future research should therefore consider a modified version of this task to further explore the cognitions of scouts whilst observing and identifying potential talent."

Both groups have merit for future public health interventions to prevent development of a range of prevalent non-communicable diseases.Data collected in the 2002 (15 countries), 2005 (30 countries), 2013 (28 countries) and 2017 (28 countries) Eurobarometer surveys were used, including around 15,000 respondents in 2002 and >26,000 respondents in the other years. Sitting time and moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity were measured with the validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short. High sitting was defined as >7.5 hours per day. Respondents in the lowest quartile of total reported days of physical activity (i.e. days walking, days in moderate activity, and days in vigorous activity) were defined as least active. Multivariate odds ratios of high sitting, and high sitting-least active were assessed by country and socio-demographic characteristics for each survey year using binary logistic regression analyses.Trends in sitting time were relatively stable over a 15-year period, although this time trend was limited by a change in the sitting question between 2005 and 2013. Men, higher educated people, students, retired people, white collar workers, people living in urban areas, people with lower physical activity levels, and people living in the Czech Republic, Denmark or the Netherlands were consistently more likely to be in the high sitting group across all four survey years. Similarly, men, students, retired people, unemployed people, white collar workers, and people living in the Czech Republic or Denmark were consistently more likely to be in the high sitting-least active group across all four surveys.This study identified population sub-groups that need special attention in public health interventions to lower total sitting time."
https://openalex.org/W2986279671,"Introduction In Ethiopia, >300 GeneXpert instruments have been deployed for tuberculosis (TB) testing using the Xpert MTB/RIF cartridge. Implementing quality indicators is necessary for monitoring and evaluating the quality of Xpert MTB/RIF diagnostic services. Objective To assess the use of quality indicators for the Xpert MTB/RIF molecular assay in Ethiopia and to compare the findings with the predefined targets described in the literature. Methods Clinical specimens collected from patients with suspected TB were subjected to Xpert MTB/RIF testing at the National TB Reference Laboratory (NTRL) between January and December 2018. Data were collected from GeneXpert software and Laboratory Information System (LIS) databases. Quality indicators were calculated and analyzed. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS software version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Results Of the 2515 specimens tested, 2274 (90.4%) had successful test results; 18.2% were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Among MTB positives (n = 413), 4.8% and 1.0% were rifampicin (RIF)-resistant and RIF-indeterminate cases, respectively. Unsuccessful results were 241 (9.6%); 8.9% of the total number of tests were errors, 0.04% had invalid results and 0.6% ‘no result’. The most frequent error was probe check failure (error 5007). Instrument module A4, B2, B3, C3, and D3 (p<0.05) and tester experience (p<0.05) had a statistically significant association with errors in multivariate analysis. Additional 42 MTB cases (9.2% of the total cases) were detected among unsuccessful results by follow-up tests. Sixty-four percent of the initial test results were released within the turnaround time (TAT) ≤24 hours. Conclusion Most of the quality indicators for the Xpert MTB/RIF molecular assay were maintained within the targets. However, the error rate and TAT were out of the targets. Defective modules and lacking experience were the factors affecting successful test outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2988081078,"Striated muscle is activated by myosin- and actin-linked processes, with the latter being regulated through changes in the position of tropomyosin relative to the actin surface. The C-terminal region of cardiac troponin T (TnT), a tropomyosin-associated protein, is required for full TnT inactivation at low Ca2+ and for limiting its activation at saturating Ca2+. Here, we investigated whether basic residues in this TnT region are involved in these activities, whether the TnT C terminus undergoes Ca2+-dependent conformational changes, and whether these residues affect cardiac muscle contraction. We generated a human cardiac TnT variant in which we replaced seven C-terminal Lys and Arg residues with Ala and added a Cys residue at either position 289 or 275 to affix a fluorescent probe. At pCa 3.7, actin filaments containing high-alanine TnT had an elevated ATPase rate like that obtained when the last TnT 14 residues were deleted. Acrylodan-tropomyosin fluorescence changes and S1-actin binding kinetics revealed that at pCa 8, the high-alanine TnT-containing filaments did not enter the first inactive state. FRET analyses indicated that the C-terminal TnT region approached Cys-190 of tropomyosin as actin filaments transitioned to the inactive B state; that transition was abolished with high-alanine TnT. High-alanine TnT-containing cardiac muscle preparations had increased Ca2+ sensitivity of both steady-state isometric force and sinusoidal stiffness as well as increased maximum steady-state isometric force and sinusoidal stiffness. We conclude that C-terminal basic residues in cardiac TnT are critical for the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction.

https://openalex.org/W2989281186,"Sorting spikes from extracellular recording into clusters associated with distinct single units (putative neurons) is a fundamental step in analyzing neuronal populations. Such spike sorting is intrinsically unsupervised, as the number of neurons are not known a priori. Therefor, any spike sorting is an unsupervised learning problem that requires either of the two approaches: specification of a fixed value k for the number of clusters to seek, or generation of candidate partitions for several possible values of c, followed by selection of a best candidate based on various post-clustering validation criteria. In this paper, we investigate the first approach and evaluate the utility of several methods for providing lower dimensional visualization of the cluster structure and on subsequent spike clustering. We also introduce a visualization technique called improved visual assessment of cluster tendency (iVAT) to estimate possible cluster structures in data without the need for dimensionality reduction. Experimental results are conducted on two datasets with ground truth labels. In data with a relatively small number of clusters, iVAT is beneficial in estimating the number of clusters to inform the initialization of clustering algorithms. With larger numbers of clusters, iVAT gives a useful estimate of the coarse cluster structure but sometimes fails to indicate the presumptive number of clusters. We show that noise associated with recording extracellular neuronal potentials can disrupt computational clustering schemes, highlighting the benefit of probabilistic clustering models. Our results show that t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) provides representations of the data that yield more accurate visualization of potential cluster structure to inform the clustering stage. Moreover, The clusters obtained using t-SNE features were more reliable than the clusters obtained using the other methods, which indicates that t-SNE can potentially be used for both visualization and to extract features to be used by any clustering algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2983345359,"Down syndrome (DS) is a chromosomal disorder caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Ts21). Unbalanced karyotypes can lead to dysfunction of the proteostasis network (PN) and disrupted proteostasis is mechanistically associated with multiple DS comorbidities. Autophagy is a critical component of the PN that has not previously been investigated in DS. Based on our previous observations of PN disruption in DS, we investigated possible dysfunction of the autophagic machinery in human DS fibroblasts and other DS cell models. Following induction of autophagy by serum starvation, DS fibroblasts displayed impaired autophagic flux indicated by autophagolysosome accumulation and elevated p62, NBR1, and LC3-II abundance, compared to age- and sex-matched, euploid (CTL) fibroblasts. While lysosomal physiology was unaffected in both groups after serum starvation, we observed decreased basal abundance of the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor Attachment protein Receptor (SNARE) family members syntaxin 17 (STX17) and Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein 8 (VAMP8) indicating that decreased autophagic flux in DS is due at least in part to a possible impairment of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This conclusion was further supported by the observation that over-expression of either STX17 or VAMP8 in DS fibroblasts restored autophagic degradation and reversed p62 accumulation. Collectively, our results indicate that impaired autophagic clearance is a characteristic of DS cells that can be reversed by enhancement of SNARE protein expression and provides further evidence that PN disruption represents a candidate mechanism for multiple aspects of pathogenesis in DS and a possible future target for therapeutic intervention."

This free l-Trp–dependent mechanism of inhibition of translation termination remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of l-Trp on the function of two known E. coli translation termination factors, RF1 and RF2. Using a series of reporter genes, we found that the in vivo l-Trp sensitivity of tnaC gene expression is influenced by the identity of its stop codon, with the UGA stop codon producing higher expression efficiency of the tnaA-lacZ gene construct than the UAG stop codon. In vitro TnaC-peptidyl-tRNA accumulation and toe-printing assays confirmed that in the presence of l-Trp, the UGA stop codon generates higher accumulation of both TnaC-peptidyl-tRNA and arrested ribosomes than does the UAG stop codon. RF-mediated hydrolysis assays corroborated that l-Trp blocks RF2 function more than that of RF1. Mutational analyses disclosed that amino acids substitutions at the 246 and 256 residue positions surrounding the RF2-GGQ functional motif reduce l-Trp–dependent expression of the tnaC(UGA) tnaA-lacZ construct and the ability of l-Trp to inhibit RF2-mediated cleavage of the TnaC-peptidyl-tRNA. Altogether, our results indicate that l-Trp preferentially blocks RF2 activity during translation termination of the tnaC gene.

Translation termination in bacteria is initiated by a couple of protein paralogs named release factor 1 (RF1) 5The abbreviations used are: RFrelease factor1M-l-Trp1-methyl-l-TrpIPTGisopropyl β-d-1 thiogalactopyranosidel-PSA5′-O-(N-(l-prolyl)-sulfamoyl)-adenosinel-Trpl-tryptophanPTCpeptidyl transferase center. and 2 (RF2). Once bound to the ribosome, these RF proteins promote hydrolysis of the resident peptidyl-tRNA by aiding in the accommodation of a molecule of water at the ribosome active site, also known as the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) (1Korostelev A.

RF1 or RF2 initiates translation termination by recognizing distinct stop codons (UAA/UAG for RF1; UAA/UGA for RF2) located at the small subunit ribosomal A-site decoding center (3Scolnick E.

Once these release factors recognize their corresponding stop codons, they change their free-state compact conformation (closed conformation) to an extended conformation (open conformation) where the tip of RF1/RF2 domain 3 reaches the PTC (4Trappl K.

After hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA, RF1 resides within the ribosomal complex until it dissociates from the ribosome with the help of release factor 3 (RF3), whereas RF2 can independently dissociate itself from the ribosomes (12Adio S.

RF1 protein has shown longer residence time within the ribosome than RF2, explaining the need for the release action of RF3 (12Adio S. Sharma H. Senyushkina T. Karki P. Maracci C. Wohlgemuth I.

Translation termination is completed when the ribosome release factor interacts at the empty A-site, and along with elongation factor G disassembles the translating ribosome separating the two subunits from the translated mRNA and the last deacylated tRNA (14Pavlov M.Y.

Fast recycling of Escherichia coli ribosomes requires both ribosome recycling factor (RRF) and release factor RF3.EMBO J. 1997; 16 (9233822): 4134-414110.1093/emboj/16.13.4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). release factor 1-methyl-l-Trp isopropyl β-d-1 thiogalactopyranoside 5′-O-(N-(l-prolyl)-sulfamoyl)-adenosine l-tryptophan peptidyl transferase center. The tnaCAB (tna) operon is a bacterial chromosomal unit whose function is related to the degradation of external l-tryptophan (l-Trp) and the formation of indole, a biofilm, and quorum-sensing regulatory metabolite (15Wood T.K. Hong S.H. Ma Q. Engineering biofilm formation and dispersal.Trends Biotechnol. 2011; 29 (21131080): 87-9410.1016/j.tibtech.2010.11.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The tna operon is constituted by a 5′-regulatory leader region and two structural genes tnaA and tnaB, which express the tryptophanase enzyme and an l-Trp–specific transporter, respectively. The 5′-regulatory leader region of the tna operon contains a small ORF, tnaC, and a Rho-dependent transcription termination sequence. Transcription of the tna operon is induced primarily by the absence of a rich carbon source (16Deeley M.C. Yanofsky C. Transcription initiation at the tryptophanase promoter of Escherichia coli K-12.J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151 (6284718): 942-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription coupled to translational expression of tnaC, which synthesizes the TnaC regulatory nascent peptide, allows RNA polymerase to continue synthesizing mRNA downstream of the tnaC gene. In Escherichia coli, under limiting concentrations of l-Trp, translation of the tnaC gene terminates at its UGA stop codon, releasing translating ribosomes from the nascent mRNA (17Gong F. Yanofsky C. Reproducing tna operon regulation in vitro in an S-30 system. Tryptophan induction inhibits cleavage of TnaC peptidyl-tRNA.J. Biol.

The release of the ribosomes exposes a rut site that overlaps the tnaC stop codon, allowing Rho to terminate transcription before reaching the first structural gene, tnaA. Under activating concentrations of l-Trp, ribosomes translating tnaC are arrested at its UGA stop codon, blocking the rut site and action of Rho and allowing transcription of the structural genes (18Stewart V. Yanofsky C. Role of leader peptide synthesis in tryptophanase operon expression in Escherichia coli K-12.J.

Previous in vivo studies have shown that the expression of the tna structural genes is affected by the identity of the tnaC stop codon (20Konan K.V. Yanofsky C. Role of ribosome release in regulation of tna operon expression in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181 (10049385): 1530-1536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under the presence of activating concentrations of l-Trp, tnaC genes with either UAG or UAA codons induced less expression of tnaA’-’lacZ reporter genes than tnaC genes with UGA codons (20Konan K.V. Yanofsky C. Role of ribosome release in regulation of tna operon expression in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181 (10049385): 1530-1536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where 85 and 50% reporter gene expression reduction were observed after replacing the tnaC UGA stop codon with UAG and UAA stop codons, respectively (20Konan K.V. Yanofsky C. Role of ribosome release in regulation of tna operon expression in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181 (10049385): 1530-1536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the degree of inhibition of translation termination by l-Trp at the tnaC sequences may depend on the identity and kinetic characteristics of the release factor involved, with RF2, which recognizes the UGA stop codon, being more susceptible to l-Trp-induced inhibition of peptide release than RF1, which recognizes the UAG stop codon. Notably, these previous results were obtained in E. coli K12 strains that express a RF2 Thr-246 variant, a less active protein compared with the RF2 Ala-246 variant present in E. coli B strains (6Mora L. Heurgue-Hamard V. de Zamaroczy M. Kervestin S. Buckingham R.H. Methylation of bacterial release factors RF1 and RF2 is required for normal translation termination in vivo.J. Biol.

Unfortunately, there are no studies of the expression of the tna operon under the action of the more active versions of RF2. Biochemical and structural analyses have shown that arrested ribosomes at the tnaC sequences contain TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro molecules in their P-sites (21Cruz-Vera L.R. Rajagopal S. Squires C.

Once l-Trp is removed, TnaC-tRNAPro molecules within the arrested ribosomes become sensitive to the hydrolysis action of RF2, indicating that l-Trp is required for the inhibition of the activity of RF2 at the PTC (26Cruz-Vera L.R. Gong M. Yanofsky C. Changes produced by bound tryptophan in the ribosome peptidyl transferase center in response to TnaC, a nascent leader peptide.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Several studies indicate that conformational changes in the PTC induced through the TnaC nascent peptide and the exit tunnel components are important for inhibiting RF2 (22Bischoff L. Berninghausen O. Beckmann R. Molecular basis for the ribosome functioning as an L-tryptophan sensor.Cell Rep. 2014; 9 (25310980): 469-47510.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cryo-EM structures of the ribosome in complex with the stalled TnaC nascent peptide show that the PTC nucleotide residues U2585 and A2602 acquire a conformational distribution that would clash with the amino acid residues at the tip of the domain 3 of RF2, likely hindering their proper positioning or accommodation within the ribosome (22Bischoff L. Berninghausen O. Beckmann R. Molecular basis for the ribosome functioning as an L-tryptophan sensor.Cell Rep. 2014; 9 (25310980): 469-47510.1016/j.celrep.2014.09.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Tian P.

Even though the structural studies revealed unfavorable conformational changes of PTC nucleotides, it remained unclear why the TnaC-mediated stalling could preferentially affect the function of RF2 over that of RF1, when their conserved GGQ motif acts in the same region of the ribosome during peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis. In this work, we aimed to determine why the function of RF2 in translation termination is more susceptible to the inhibitory action of the TnaC nascent peptide and l-Trp in the ribosomal termination complex as compared with the function of RF1. We performed genetic and biochemical assays to study the effects of RF1 and RF2 protein variants on the expression of the tna operon, accumulation of arrested ribosomes, and cleavage of TnaC-tRNAPro2 molecules in the presence of l-Trp. Our results indicate that distinct RF2 residues located at the PTC during translation termination make this protein more susceptible than RF1 to translation termination inhibition by the TnaC nascent peptide and l-Trp. Previous experiments that compared the expression of tnaC tnaA’-’lacZ reporter genes containing variations in their tnaC stop codon (20Konan K.V. Yanofsky C. Role of ribosome release in regulation of tna operon expression in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181 (10049385): 1530-1536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed under conditions where cellular l-Trp concentrations are affected by the expression of the tryptophanase enzyme (30Vazquez-Laslop N. Thum C. Mankin A.S. Molecular mechanism of drug-dependent ribosome stalling.Mol.

We decided to analyze the in vivo expression of these tnaC tnaA’-’lacZ reporter gene variants using 1M-l-Trp as an inducer, because this analog of l-Trp can induce the expression of the tna operon without being metabolized by tryptophanase (27Yanofsky C. Horn V. Gollnick P. Physiological studies of tryptophan transport and tryptophanase operon induction in Escherichia coli.J.

It is important to note that these are K12-derived bacterial strains, and they therefore express the RF2 Thr-246 protein variant (6Mora L. Heurgue-Hamard V. de Zamaroczy M. Kervestin S. Buckingham R.H. Methylation of bacterial release factors RF1 and RF2 is required for normal translation termination in vivo.J. Biol.

Bacterial pellets from the final cultures were used to determine β-gal activity (see “Experimental procedures”). Data are summarized in Fig. 1. We observed that the β-gal expression increased with increasing amounts of inducer in all three bacterial strains (Fig. 1A). At more than 40 μm 1M-l-Trp the SVS1144 (tnaC-UGA) strain generated the highest β-gal synthesis, two and five times more than the enzyme synthesis observed in the PDG1144 (tnaC-UAA) and VK800 (tnaC-UAG) strains, respectively. The graphs in Fig. 1A show a sharp increase in the enzyme expression between 0 and 5 μm 1M-l-Trp, which was previously observed with the SVS1144 strain (30Vazquez-Laslop N. Thum C. Mankin A.S. Molecular mechanism of drug-dependent ribosome stalling.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30 (18439898): 190-20210.1016/j.molcel.2008.02.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). After testing the range between 0 and 5 μm 1M-l-Trp, we observed a linear correlation between the expression of the enzyme and the concentration of inducer (Fig. 1B). We calculated that the reporter gene of the SVS1144 (tnaC-UGA) strain produced an expression efficiency of 230 Miller units of β-gal activity per 1 μm 1M-l-Trp, four times greater than the expression efficiency of the reporter gene of the PDG1144 (tnaC-UAA) strain and 20 times higher than the expression efficiency of the reporter gene of the VK800 (tnaC-UAG) strain. These results indicate that the reporter gene with a tnaC-UGA sequence is more sensitive to 1M-l-Trp than the constructs containing a tnaC sequence with either a UAA or a UAG codon. These data also suggest that 1M-l-Trp could be more efficient in blocking translation termination at the RF2-specific UGA codon than the RF1/2 UAA and RF1-specific UAG codons. The results shown in Fig. 1 suggest that l-Trp–induced ribosome arrest at the tnaC sequences could be more efficient if the tnaC stop codon is UGA rather than UAA or UAG. To determine whether such an argument could be true, we decided to analyze the formation in vitro of l-Trp–arrested ribosomes within the tnaC sequences containing variations at their stop codon positions. We used a reconstituted protein synthesis system obtained from E. coli K12 strains where T7 RNA polymerase transcribes supplied DNA fragments (PURExpress from New England Biolabs). The reconstituted protein synthesis system contains the RF2 Thr-246 protein variant. Reactions were performed using PCR fragments that contained the tnaC gene variants, where transcription is controlled by a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, and translation is enhanced by an omega sequence located upstream of the tnaC-Shine-Dalgarno ribosome-binding sequence (30Vazquez-Laslop N. Thum C. Mankin A.S. Molecular mechanism of drug-dependent ribosome stalling.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30 (18439898): 190-20210.1016/j.molcel.2008.02.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Northern blotting assays were performed to detect the accumulation of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 (see “Experimental procedures”). Accumulation of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 indicates that translation termination is inhibited during the expression of tnaC, generating arrested ribosomes at its stop codon. As seen in Fig. 2A, in the presence of 4 mm l-Trp, both 30 nm UGA and UAG tnaC-PCR fragments induced accumulation of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 molecules (see lanes 1 and 3). To confirm that the detected signal is a product of the inhibitory action of l-Trp and the regulatory TnaC nascent peptide we used tnaC-PCR fragments containing a change at the tnaC Trp-12 codon (W12R). This amino acid substitution generates a nonfunctional TnaC nascent peptide that cannot produce ribosome arrest under activating concentrations of l-Trp (18Stewart V. Yanofsky C. Role of leader peptide synthesis in tryptophanase operon expression in Escherichia coli K-12.J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167 (3522554): 383-38610.1128/jb.167.1.383-386.1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We did not observe accumulation of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 under the same conditions when the tnaC (W12R)-PCR fragments UGA and UAG were used for the reactions (compare lane 1 with 2 or lane 3 with 4), or when a translation inhibitor was added to the reactions (compare lanes 1 and 3 with lanes 5 and 7, respectively). These last sets of data suggest that such TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 accumulation depends on the amino acid composition of the TnaC nascent peptide and on the translation of both tnaC variants, UGA and UAG. We tested l-Trp–induced accumulation of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 using several concentrations of tnaC-PCR fragments ranging from 0 to 60 nm to compare the capacity of both tnaC UGA and UAG variants for accumulating arrested ribosomes under high concentrations of l-Trp (4 mm). We observed that both tnaC variants generated maximum accumulation of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 at DNA concentrations higher than 30 nm (Fig. 2B). We suspect that in the presence of 4 mm l-Trp, high concentrations of the tnaC PCR fragments could reduce the pool of tRNAPro2 limiting the production of stalled ribosomes, generating the plateau behavior observed in the curve obtained with the tnaC UGA PCR fragments (Fig. 2B, closed circles). Depletion of the cellular pool of tRNAPro2 has been seen in vivo during overexpression of the tnaC UGA gene (31Gong M. Gong F. Yanofsky C. Overexpression of tnaC of Escherichia coli inhibits growth by depleting tRNA2Pro availability.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188 (16484200): 1892-189810.1128/JB.188.5.1892-1898.2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). At concentrations lower than 30 nm, however, the tnaC-UAG DNA variant generated lesser amounts of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 than the tnaC-UGA variant. The biggest differences between both variants were seen at concentrations lower than 7 nm, where the tnaC-UGA variant still reached maximum accumulation, whereas the tnaC-UAG variant produced roughly 40% of maximum accumulation. Therefore, we decided to do further in vitro tests using 7 nm for the two tnaC-PCR fragment variants. To determine the differences in l-Trp sensitivity of both constructs, we tested accumulation of TnaC-tRNAPro2 under two concentrations of l-Trp, 0.3 mm (low) and 4 mm (high), which have shown significant differences in in vitro accumulation of arrested ribosomes (27Yanofsky C. Horn V. Gollnick P. Physiological studies of tryptophan transport and tryptophanase operon induction in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173 (1917834): 6009-601710.1128/jb.173.19.6009-6017.1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We observed that at 7 nm concentrations both the tnaC-UGA and tnaC–UAG DNA variants accumulated TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 under both high and low l-Trp concentrations (Fig. 2C). At high l-Trp concentrations the tnaC-UGA DNA generated twice the amount of TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 molecules than at low l-Trp concentrations. Similarly, at high l-Trp concentrations the tnaC-UAG variant generated four times more TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 molecules than at low l-Trp concentrations. Both results indicate that each of these tnaC variants are still sensitive to changes in l-Trp concentrations. However, the tnaC-UGA DNA variant accumulates more TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 than the tnaC-UAG DNA variant at either l-Trp concentrations (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5 and 6). At high l-Trp concentrations, the tnaC-UGA DNA variant accumulates four times more TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 molecules than the tnaC-UAG DNA variant (Fig. 2C, compare lane 2 with lane 6). Meanwhile, at low l-Trp concentrations, the tnaC-UGA DNA variant accumulates eight times more TnaC-peptidyl-tRNAPro2 molecules than the tnaC-UAG DNA variant (Fig. 2C, compare lane 1 with lane 5). These results suggest that the tnaC-UGA variant is more efficient at accumulating arrested ribosomes than the tnaC-UAG variant at the l-Trp concen"

https://openalex.org/W2984226032,"Purpose Cervical cancer remains the second most common cancer and cancer-related death among women in Ethiopia. This is the first study, to our knowledge, describing the demographic, and clinicopathologic characteristics of cervical cancer cases in a mainly rural, Southwestern Ethiopian population with a low literacy rate to provide data on the cervical cancer burden and help guide future prevention and intervention efforts. Methods A descriptive analysis of 154 cervical cancer cases at the Jimma University Teaching Hospital in Southwestern Ethiopia from January 2008 –December 2010 was performed. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from patient questionnaires and cervical punch biopsies were histologically examined. Results Of the 154 participants with a histopathologic diagnosis of cervical cancer, 95.36% had not heard of cervical cancer and 89.6% were locally advanced at the time of diagnosis. Moreover, 86.4% of participants were illiterate, and 62% lived in a rural area. Conclusion A majority of the 154 women with cervical cancer studied at the Jimma University Teaching Hospital in Southwestern Ethiopia were illiterate, had not heard of cervical cancer and had advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Given the low rates of literacy and knowledge regarding cervical cancer in this population which has been shown to correlate with a decreased odds of undergoing screening, future interventions to address the cervical cancer burden here must include an effective educational component."
https://openalex.org/W2985385268,"The exploration of and search for romantic relationships is one of the developmental tasks that characterise emerging adulthood, a new developmental phase halfway between adolescence and full adulthood. This study aims to explore, in a Mediterranean country, the existing relationships between the subjective perception of some parental behaviour and the anxiety and avoidance dimensions of attachment during emerging adulthood. To do so, 1,502 university students (903 women and 599 men) aged between 18 and 29 (M = 20.32 and SD = 2.13) completed a self-report questionnaire. The results revealed that perceived family support and perceived parental warmth were negatively associated with the avoidance and anxiety dimensions. In contrast, perceived parental control (both behavioural and psychological) was found to be positively associated with both attachment dimensions. Perceived behavioural control was also found to play a moderator role between perceived parental warmth and romantic attachment anxiety. Only in cases in which emerging adults of our sample perceived low levels of behavioural control was warmth found to be negatively associated with anxiety. The main conclusion of this work is the negative impact that parental control seems to have on romantic attachment during emerging adulthood. The results are discussed with a focus on the continuing importance of the family context in relation to the completion of developmental tasks, even during emerging adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2987911635,"Several antineoplastic drugs have been proposed as new compounds for pulmonary arterial hypertension treatment but many have cardiotoxic side effects. The chemotherapeutic agent 6-mercaptopurine may have an effect in treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension but at the same time, its effects on the afterload adaption of the right ventricle is unpredictable due to interaction with multiple downstream signalling pathways in the cardiomyocytes. We investigated the direct cardiac effects of 6-mercaptopurine in rats with isolated right heart failure caused by pulmonary trunk banding (PTB).Male Wistar rat weanlings (112±2 g) were randomized to sham operation (sham, n = 10) or PTB. The PTB animals were randomized to placebo (PTB-control, n = 10) and 6-mercaptopurine (7.5 mg/kg/day) groups with treatment start before the PTB procedure (PTB-prevention, n = 10) or two weeks after (PTB-reversal, n = 10). Right ventricular effects were evaluated by echocardiography, cardiac MRI, invasive pressure-volume measurements, and histological and molecular analyses.PTB increased right ventricular afterload and caused right ventricular hypertrophy and failure. 6-mercaptopurine did not improve right ventricular function nor reduce right ventricular remodelling in both prevention and reversal studies compared with placebo-treated rats.Treatment with 6-mercaptopurine did not have any beneficial or detrimental effects on right ventricular function or remodelling. Our data suggest that treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with 6-mercaptopurine is not harmful to the failing right ventricle."
https://openalex.org/W2986642697,"The aim of the study was the evaluation of a three-step method for the selection of bacterial strains capable of producing surfactin. The procedure consisted of the following steps: 1.blood agar test, 2. measurement of the surface tension (ST) of the medium using the du Nouy method before and after submerged culture, 3. qualitative and quantitative assessment of surfactin by HPLC. Forty five Bacillus subtilis natto strains producing haemolysis zones (≥3mm) were selected. Nineten of them reduced ST of the medium to ≤ 40 mN/m; in six cases, the reduction was as much as 50%. All indicated strains produced surfactin. Positive correlations (p <0.5) between the percentage reduction of ST of the medium and surfactin concentration (r = 0.44), indicate that this parameter is determinant of the ability to synthesize this compound. The blood agar test has been shown to be useful only as a pre-selection criterion for surfactin producers (18 strains selected by this method reduced ST by only ≤30%). The proposed selection strategy proved effective and made it possible to select the BS15 strain that reduced the ST of the medium to 30.56 ± 0.15 mN/m and simultaneously provided a high concentration of surfactin compared to other strains."

A total of one hundred sixty-seven young promises futsal players participated in this study (84 U16 and 83 U19) and have been chosen to play Championship of Spain Selections. The Psychological Characteristics related to SP for soccer players Questionnaire was used, and one-way ANOVA test was performed based on the playing position (goalkeeper, defender and defender-wing, wing and wing-defender, pivot and wing-pivot, and universal). Results showed that goalkeepers had the best psychological profile and characteristics related to SP. Pivots and wing-pivots had less self-confidence, and universals players, less stress control in relation to the rest of the playing positions (p < 0.05). The main findings revealed that the psychological characteristics and profile related to SP in young promises futsal players are different according to the playing position, and this study suggest the inclusion of psychological-training programs in order to improve the psychological abilities of players, especially for players with offensive role who seek to score goals."
https://openalex.org/W2987622901,"The components of minute ventilation, respiratory frequency and tidal volume, appear differentially regulated and thereby afford unique insight into the ventilatory response to exercise. However, respiratory frequency and tidal volume are infrequently reported, and have not previously been considered among military veterans with Gulf War Illness. Our purpose was to evaluate respiratory frequency and tidal volume in response to a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test in individuals with and without Gulf War Illness.20 cases with Gulf War Illness and 14 controls participated in this study and performed maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Ventilatory variables (minute ventilation, respiratory frequency and tidal volume) were obtained and normalized to peak exercise capacity. Using mixed-design analysis of variance models, with group and time as factors, we analyzed exercise ventilatory patterns for the entire sample and for 11 subjects from each group matched for race, age, sex, and height.Despite similar minute ventilation (p = 0.57, η2p = 0.01), tidal volume was greater (p = 0.02, η2p = 0.16) and respiratory frequency was lower (p = 0.004, η2p = 0.24) in Veterans with Gulf War Illness than controls. The findings for respiratory frequency remained significant in the matched subgroup (p = 0.004, η2p = 0.35).In our sample, veterans with Gulf War Illness adopt a unique exercise ventilatory pattern characterized by reduced respiratory frequency, despite similar ventilation relative to controls. Although the mechanism(s) by which this pattern is achieved remains unresolved, our findings suggest that the components of ventilation should be considered when evaluating clinical conditions with unexplained exertional symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2984071624,"Background Different equations have been used to describe and understand the growth kinetics of undisturbed malignant solid tumors. The aim of this paper is to propose a new formulation of the Gompertz equation in terms of different parameters of a malignant tumor: the intrinsic growth rate, the deceleration factor, the apoptosis rate, the number of cells corresponding to the tumor latency time, and the fractal dimensions of the tumor and its contour. Methods Furthermore, different formulations of the Gompertz equation are used to fit experimental data of the Ehrlich and fibrosarcoma Sa-37 tumors that grow in male BALB/c/Cenp mice. The parameters of each equation are obtained from these fittings. Results The new formulation of the Gompertz equation reveals that the initial number of cancerous cells in the conventional Gompertz equation is not a constant but a variable that depends nonlinearly on time and the tumor deceleration factor. In turn, this deceleration factor depends on the apoptosis rate of tumor cells and the fractal dimensions of the tumor and its irregular contour. Conclusions It is concluded that this new formulation has two parameters that are directly estimated from the experiment, describes well the growth kinetics of unperturbed Ehrlich and fibrosarcoma Sa-37 tumors, and confirms the fractal origin of the Gompertz formulation and the fractal property of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2986189207,"Background Stenoses of internal pudendal arteries (IPAs) appear to be related to erectile dysfunction (ED). Nevertheless, the correlation between the severity of ED and stenosis of the IPAs is not well established. Objectives To evaluate angiographic findings of IPAs in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and to assess the correlation between the severity of ED and IPA stenosis. Materials and methods Ninety-one patients who were scheduled for cardiac angiogram (CAG) because of suspected CAD participated. ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. Erectile function (EF) domain scoring was used to assess the severity of ED: severe (EF score = 1–10); moderate (11–16); mild-moderate (17–21); mild (22–25); and no ED (26–30). Angiography was performed in bilateral common, internal iliac, and IPAs and the location and extent of stenoses were measured. We divided patients according to those with maximum stenosis of less than 50% (Group I) and those with more than 50% (Group II), regardless of direction. Results We diagnosed 88 patients (88/91, 96.70%) with ED. There was no correlation between increasing age and severity of ED (r = - 0.063, p = 0.555). There were 72 patients in Group I and 19 in Group II. In Group I, 62 patients were diagnosed with ED even though there was no stenosis. There was no significant correlation between the severity of ED and the extent of stenosis in IPAs (r = -0.118, p = 0.265). Conclusions There was no significant correlation between the severity of ED and the extent of stenosis of IPAs. We believe that this is because the progression of ED is induced by endothelial cell dysfunction, not by mechanical obstruction leading to blood flow reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2987775350,"Background Recent evidence suggests that antibiotic-induced changes in the composition of intestinal microflora, as well as the systemic immunoendocrine effects that result from them, can modulate myocardial tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tetracycline (TTC) on myocardial infarct size in the isolated hearts obtained from obese rats with chemically-induced colitis (CIC). The association between TTC-induced changes in infarct size and intestinal microbiome composition as well as plasma levels of cytokines and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was also studied. Methods Obesity was induced in Wistar rats by feeding them a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet for five weeks. A single rectal administration of 3% acetic acid (2 mL) to the rats resulted in CIC. Healthy rats as well as obese rats with CIC received TTC (15 mg daily for 3 days) via gavage. The rats were euthanized, after which isolated heart perfusion with simulated global ischemia and reperfusion was performed. Infarct size was determined histochemically. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokine levels in plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas SCFA levels in plasma were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The intestinal microbiome was analyzed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results The treatment with TTC resulted in significant infarct size limitation (50 ± 7 vs. 62 ± 4% for the control mice, p < 0.05) in the hearts from intact animals. However, infarct size was not different between the control rats and the obese rats with CIC. Furthermore, infarct size was significantly larger in TTC-treated obese rats with CIC than it was in the control animals (77 ± 5%, p < 0.05). The concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and LPS in serum were elevated in the obese rats with CIC. Compared to the control rats, the rats with both obesity and CIC had lower counts of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. but higher counts of Escherichia coli. The effects of TTC on infarct size were not associated with specific changes in SCFA levels. Conclusions TTC reduced infarct size in the healthy rats. However, this effect was reversed in the obese animals with CIC. Additionally, it was associated with specific changes in gut microbiota and significantly elevated levels of cytokines and LPS."
https://openalex.org/W2988519094,"Dysmenorrhea and stroke are health problems affecting women worldwide in their day-to-day lives; however, there is limited knowledge of the stroke risk in women with dysmenorrhea, and there have been no studies assessing the specific distribution of stroke subtypes. This case-control study assessed stroke subtypes by age and the role of comorbidities in women with dysmenorrhea.Data obtained between 1997 and 2013 from Taiwan's health insurance database identified 514 stroke cases and 31,201 non-stroke controls in women with dysmenorrhea aged 15-49 years. Proportional distributions of subtypes and odds ratios (ORs) of stroke associated with comorbidities by age and subtype were measured. We found that the stroke risk in dysmenorrheal patients increased with age, and that hypertension was nine-fold more prevalent in the stroke cases than in the controls and was associated with an adjusted OR of 4.53 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.46-5.92) for all stroke cases. Moreover, the proportion of hemorrhagic stroke was greater than that of ischemic stroke in younger dysmenorrheal patients between 15-24 years old (50.5% vs. 11.4%), whereas this was reversed in those aged 30-49 years old (16.1% vs. 21.0%). Overall, 25.3% of the stroke cases consisted of transient cerebral ischemia and 31.3% were other acute but ill-defined cerebrovascular diseases, in which the prevalence increased with age for both types of strokes. Hypertension was the comorbidity with the highest OR associated with each subtype stroke; diabetes, hyperlipidemia, arrhythmia, and thyroid disease were also comorbidities that were significantly associated with ill-defined cerebrovascular diseases.The stroke type varies by age in dysmenorrheal patients, and hypertension is the most important comorbidity associated with all types of stroke; therefore, more attention for stroke prevention must be paid to women with dysmenorrhea, particularly when combined with comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2984030058,"Traditionally, motion analysis in clinical laboratories using optoelectronic systems (MOCAP) is performed in acquisition volumes of limited size. Given the complexity and cost of MOCAP in larger volumes, action sports cameras (ASC) represent an alternative approach in which the cameras move along with the subject during the movement task. Thus, this study aims to compare ASC against a traditional MOCAP in the perspective of reconstructing walking and running movements in large spatial volumes, which extend over the common laboratory setup. The two systems, consisting of four cameras each, were closely mounted on a custom carrying structure endowed with wheels. Two different acquisition setups, namely steady and moving conditions, were taken into account. A devoted calibration procedure, using the same protocol for the two systems, enabled the reconstruction of surface markers, placed on voluntary subjects, during the two acquisition setups. The comparison was quantitatively expressed in terms of three-dimensional (3D) marker reconstruction and kinematic computation quality. The quality of the marker reconstruction quality was quantified by means of the mean absolute error (MAE) of inter-marker distance and two-stick angle. The kinematic computation quality was quantified by means of the measure of the knee angle reconstruction during walking and running trials. In order to evaluate the camera system and moving camera effects, we used a Wilcoxon rank sum test and a Kruskal Wallis test (post-hoc Tukey), respectively. The Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were applied to compare the kinematic data obtained by the two camera systems. We found small ASC MAE values (< 2.6mm and 1.3°), but they were significantly bigger than the MOCAP (< 0.7mm and 0.6°). However, for the human movement no significant differences were found between kinematic variables in walking and running acquisitions (p>0.05), and the motion patterns of the right-left knee angles between both systems were very similar (ρ>0.90, p<0.05). These results highlighted the promising results of a system that uses ASC based on the procedure of mobile cameras to follow the movement of the subject, allowing a less constrained movement in the direction in which the structure moves, compared to the traditional laboratory setup."

Design This was a qualitative study using examination reports from the course for care managers. Systematic text condensation according to Malterud was used for the analysis. Setting Primary health care centres Subject Twenty-eight newly educated care managers in primary health care participated in the study. The median age was 50 (31–68) years. Twenty-seven were women and one was a man. Twenty-one were employed as nurses and seven as counsellors. Results The informants perceived the role as care manager as meaningful but at times complicated. To participate in teams and to work closely with the general practitioner was experienced as important. The co-ordinating function was emphasised as especially important, as well as the increased continuity in care. The dual role as care manager and counsellor was sometimes experienced as problematic. Conclusion The informants took advantage of the knowledge they had attained during the course. They perceived themselves as being a bridge between patients and other professionals. The result of having dual roles at the primary health care centre unexpectedly revealed difficulties for some professionals. The nurses seemed more familiar with the new way of working."
https://openalex.org/W2987614637,"In a city-scale network, trips are made in thousands of origin-destination (OD) pairs connected by multiple routes, resulting in a large number of alternatives with diverse characteristics that influence the route choice behaviour of the travellers. As a consequence, to accurately predict user choices at full network scale, a route choice model should be scalable to suit all possible configurations that may be encountered. In this article, a new methodology to obtain such a model is proposed. The main idea is to use clustering analysis to obtain a small set of representative OD pairs and routes that can be investigated in detail through computer route choice experiments to collect observations on travellers behaviour. The results are then scaled-up to all other OD pairs in the network. It was found that 9 OD pair configurations are sufficient to represent the network of Lyon, France, composed of 96,096 OD pairs and 559,423 routes. The observations, collected over these nine representative OD pair configurations, were used to estimate three mixed logit models. The predictive accuracy of the three models was tested against the predictive accuracy of the same models (with the same specification), but estimated over randomly selected OD pair configurations. The obtained results show that the models estimated with the representative OD pairs are superior in predictive accuracy, thus suggesting the scaling-up to the entire network of the choices of the participants over the representative OD pair configurations, and validating the methodology in this study."

The present study investigated how aforementioned 3 different cadences are processed in the networks of bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFGs) and superior temporal gyri (STGs) with magnetoencephalography. We compared the correct rate and brain connectivity in 9 music-majors (mean age, 23.5 ± 3.4 years; musical training period, 18.7 ± 4.0 years) and 10 non-music-majors (mean age, 25.2 ± 2.6 years; musical training period, 4.2 ± 1.5 years). For the brain connectivity, we computed the summation of partial directed coherence (PDC) values for inflows/outflows to/from each area (sPDCi/sPDCo) in bilateral IFGs and STGs. In the behavioral responses, music-majors were better than non-music-majors for all 3 cadences (p < 0.05). However, sPDCi/sPDCo was prominent only for the dominant-to-submediant in the left IFG. The sPDCi was more strongly enhanced in music-majors than in non-music-majors (p = 0.002, Bonferroni corrected), while the sPDCo was vice versa (p = 0.005, Bonferroni corrected). Our data show that music-majors, with higher musical expertise, are better in identifying a less unexpected cadence than non-music-majors, with connectivity changes centered on the left IFG."
https://openalex.org/W2989176522,"Introduction In Burkina Faso in 2016, 27% and 8% of children under-5 were estimated to suffer from stunting and wasting respectively. Here, we report on infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices in rural areas of the Boucle du Mouhoun region. Materials and methods A cross-sectional population-based survey was performed in 2017 in a representative sample of mothers of children aged 6 to 23 months. IYCF practices were assessed using 24-hour dietary recall. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of IYCF practices. All analyses accounted for sampling stratification by child’s age group and for data clustering. Results According to mothers’ reports, 60% (95%CI 55, 65%) of children received the minimum meal frequency, but only 18% (95%CI 15, 22%) and 13% (95%CI 10, 16%) benefited from the minimum dietary diversity and the minimum acceptable diet respectively. Only 16% (95%CI 13, 20%) of mothers reported increasing breastfeeding or liquids and continued feeding during an episode of child illness. Knowledge of timely introduction of complementary foods and recommended feeding practices during an illness were low. Despite positive attitudes towards the introduction of key food groups, mother’s perceived self-efficacy to provide children with these food groups every day was relatively low. Discussion Our findings highlight the need for interventions to improve mothers’ knowledge and practices in relation to IYCF in the Boucle du Mouhoun region. Behaviour change communication strategies have the potential to improve IYCF indicators but should be tailored to the local context. The high attendance of health facilities for preventive well-baby consultations represents an opportunity for contact with caretakers that should be exploited for promotion and child growth monitoring."

Material and methods Data were collected from patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 or 4, with or without HIV-1 coinfection, treated with OBV/PTV/r ± DSV ± RBV at 61 Spanish sites within the initial implementation year of the first government-driven “National HCV plan.” Effectiveness was assessed by sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) and compared between monoinfected and coinfected patients using a non-inferiority margin of 5% and a 90% confidence interval (CI). Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics or patients and adverse events (AEs) were also recorded. Results Overall, 2,408 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis: 386 (16%) were patients with HIV/HCV. Patient selection reflected the real distribution of patients treated in each participating region in Spain. From the total population, 96.6% (95% CI, 95.8–97.3%) achieved SVR12. Noninferiority of SVR12 in coinfected patients was met, with a difference between monoinfected and coinfected patients of −2.2% (90% CI, −4.5% - 0.2%). Only genotype 4 was associated with non-response to OBV/PTV/r ± DSV ± RBV treatment (p<0.001) in the multivariate analysis. Overall, 286 patients (11.9%) presented AEs potentially related to OBV/PTV/r ± DSV, whereas 347 (29.0%) presented AEs potentially related to ribavirin and 61 (5.1%) interrupted ribavirin. Conclusions Our results confirm that OBV/PTV/r ± DSV ± RBV is effective and generally well tolerated in a representative sample of the HCV monoinfected and HCV/HIV coinfected population in Spain within the experience of a national strategic plan to tackle HCV."
https://openalex.org/W2983355996,"Wind speed is the most essential factor causing wheat lodging. Accurate understanding of the wind speed characteristics at near-surface layer of wheat fields and its effect on lodging is the basis of objective evaluation of wheat lodging resistance. In this paper, the characteristics of wind speed at the near-surface layer of wheat fields and their impact on lodging were studied. A new device was proposed for directly measuring the critical thrust force of wheat population lodging resistance in the field based on the black box method. A novel wheat stem lodging resistance evaluation method/model was established based on the critical thrust force of wheat population stem lodging and the wind speed characteristics of field near-surface layer. The method used the lodging critical wind speed as the index of wheat lodging resistance, which was verified by wind tunnel and field experiment. The results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the critical wind speed of wheat lodging resistance and its critical thrust force. The values of wheat canopy apparent roughness length, wind attack angle, ventilation coefficient and other wind field characteristics had important effects on the calculation of wheat lodging resistance critical wind speed. The method can eliminate bias when calculating wheat lodging resistance by considering only one or a few indicators and the results of field lodging evaluation were consistent with those of field lodging survey. The method is simple and can be used to assess the lodging resistance of wheat, select extension regions for wheat varieties, and evaluate lodging factors in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2986838400,"Efficient communication between cells requires the ability to process precursor proteins into their mature and biologically active forms, prior to secretion into the extracellular space. Eukaryotic cells achieve this via a suite of enzymes that involve a signal peptidase complex, prohormone convertases and carboxypeptidases. Using genome and transcriptome data of the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica, a universal ancestor to metazoan multicellularity, we endeavour to bridge the evolution of precursor processing machinery from single-celled eukaryotic ancestors through to the complex multicellular organisms that compromise Metazoa. The precursor processing repertoire as defined in this study of A. queenslandica consists of 3 defined signal peptidase subunits, 6 prohormone convertases and 1 carboxypeptidase, with 2 putative duplicates identified for signal peptidase complex subunits. Analysis of their gene expression levels throughout the sponge development enabled us to predict levels of activity. Some A. queenslandica precursor processing components belong to established functional clades while others were identified as having novel, yet to be discovered roles. These findings have clarified the presence of precursor processing machinery in the poriferans, showing the necessary machinery for the removal of precursor sequences, a critical post-translational modification required by multicellular organisms, and further sets a foundation towards understanding the molecular mechanism for ancient protein processing."
https://openalex.org/W2987258980,"Since its discovery in the early 1980s, there has been significant progress in understanding the biology of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Structural biologists have made tremendous contributions to this challenge, guiding the development of current therapeutic strategies. Despite our efforts, there are unresolved structural features of the virus and consequently, significant knowledge gaps in our understanding. The superstructure of the HIV-1 matrix (MA) shell has not been elucidated. Evidence by various high-resolution microscopy techniques support a model composed of MA trimers arranged in a hexameric configuration consisting of 6 MA trimers forming a hexagon. In this manuscript we review the mathematical limitations of this model and propose a new model consisting of a 6-lune hosohedra structure, which aligns with available structural evidence. We used geometric and rotational matrix computation methods to construct our model and predict a new mechanism for viral entry that explains the increase in particle size observed during CD4 receptor engagement and the most common HIV-1 ellipsoidal shapes observed in cryo-EM tomograms. A better understanding of the HIV-1 MA shell structure is a key step towards better models for viral assembly, maturation and entry. Our new model will facilitate efforts to improve understanding of the biology of HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2987926107,"Iryanthera polyneura (Myristicaceae) is popularly known as cumala-colorada, and can be found in the Amazon rain forest. The present study aimed the evaluation of the chemical composition of the essential oils (EOs) obtained from the leaves of I. polyneura throughout a two-year period in order to correlate chemical findings with seasonality and climatic variation. Leaves from I. polyneura were collected 15 times from three different individuals, identified as 22EO, 80EO and 530EO, between the years of 2009 and 2011. The EOs were obtained and tested by gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. ANOVA and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relationship between the percentage of terpenes and seasonal/climatic variations. Fifty-nine compounds were detected in the EOs, of which 44 were identified (74.5%). The main components of the EOs were spathulenol (6.42 ± 1.02%), α-cadinol (5.82 ± 0.40%) and τ-muurolol (5.24 ± 0.03%). Higher levels of spathulenol were observed in 22EO during rainy season, while τ-muurolol occurred in high amounts during the dry season, as did α-cadinol in 22EO and 80EO. Correspondence analysis revealed a distinction between two groups of EOs based on seasonality, whereas a canonic correspondence analysis and ANOVA determined how the major compounds were related to both seasonality and climatic factors. Non-metric multidimensional scaling in association with an analysis of similarities showed that the abundance and composition of terpenes in the samples varied moderately among the three Iryanthera individual plants. Present findings have shown that there is variation in the occurrence of the major compounds spathulenol, τ-muurolol and α-cadinol produced by I. polyneura and that the pattern of variation is related to season and climatic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2984288762,"The obscured pedestrian-motor vehicle crash has become a serious danger to driving safety. The present study aims to investigate the contingent negative variation (CNV) during the anticipation of an obscured pedestrian-motor vehicle crash in simulated driving. We adopted two cueing tasks: (i) a traditional cognitive paradigm of cueing task that has been widely used to study anticipatory process, and (ii) a modified cueing task in simulated driving scenes, in which Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of 32 participants were recorded to detect the CNV. Simulated car following and pedestrian crossing tasks were designed to measure anticipation-related driving behaviors. The results showed that both early and late CNVs were observed in two cueing tasks. The mean amplitude of the late CNV during a modified cueing task in simulated driving was significantly larger than that in a traditional cueing task, which was not the case for the early CNV potentials. In addition, both early and late CNVs elicited in simulated driving were significantly correlated with anticipatory driving behaviors (e.g., the minimum time to collision). These findings show that CNV potentials during the anticipation of an obscured pedestrian-motor vehicle crash might predict anticipation-related risky driving behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2987267449,"The objective of this study was to identify factors affecting the accuracy of four commercial tests for ceftiofur drug residue in milk samples from bulk tank waste milk (WM). WM samples were collected from 12 California dairy farms which were initially tested using liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) to confirm their negative status for drug residues above the FDA established tolerance/safe levels. The milk samples were also tested for fat, protein, lactose, solids non-fat (SNF), somatic cell count (SCC), coliform count, and standard plate count (SPC). Each WM sample was divided into two aliquots, one labeled as negative for drug residues (WMN) and the second spiked with ceftiofur as positive for ceftiofur residues (WMPos). Both types of WM samples were tested to evaluate the performance of 4 commercially available tests: Penzyme® Milk Test, SNAP® β–lactam, BetaStar® Plus and Delvo SP-NT®. Three assays in triplicates for the WMN and WMPos were conducted for each WM sample. Test were evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and positive likelihood ratio. Kruskal-Wallis method was used to evaluate the effect of milk quality parameters on true positive (TP) and false negative (FN) test results. All WMPos samples were identified as positive by all four tests, rendering 100% sensitivity for each test. The specificity for Penzyme, BetaStar, Delvo, and SNAP tests were 59.2, 55.5, 44.4, and 29.6, respectively. Overall, all tests correctly identified samples with ceftiofur residues (WMPos), as shown by 100% sensitivity. Greater variability was observed regarding identification of samples free of any drug residue, with Penzyme and BetaStar having the highest risk for correctly identifying TN samples. Our findings indicate that when selecting commercial tests to detect drug residues in WM, milk quality parameters must be considered if the aim is to reduce FP test results."
https://openalex.org/W2988464445,"Despite the importance of pharmacopeial standards, little is known regarding their effect on drug competition. Such information is of particular relevance given the rising costs of prescription drugs and the focus of policy-makers and other stakeholders on addressing these costs. We examined 982 prescription drugs approved by U.S Food and Drug Administration since 1982 to examine the association between U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) standards, generic entry and prescription costs. The presence of a USP drug product monograph was not associated with the time to the third generic entrant or with the likelihood of having a generic competitor. However, on average, drugs with USP drug product monographs had approximately fifty percent more generic manufacturers in the U.S. than their counterparts after accounting for factors such as market volume, age, route of administration and vintage. This greater competition was associated with an approximate savings of $6.22 billion in 2016, suggesting that USP drug product monographs may play an important role in promoting pharmaceutical competition and reducing prescription drug costs."
https://openalex.org/W2984910656,"Food hoarding is a common behavior used by a variety of animals to cope with periods of low food availability. At the retreating edge of species’ distribution, the stressful environment and unfavourable climate conditions may impose severe costs on hoarding behavior. Since relict populations are hotspots for evolution and adaptation, and considering that food hoarding behavior has a strong evolutionary basis, we decided to evaluate the occurrence of behavioral variability in the amount of food cached by the endangered Mount Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus fremonti grahamensis). We tested the variation in cache size in response to microclimate, soil relief, vegetation, food availability and squirrel sex. The number of pits excavated by squirrels to cache cones was used as a proxy of cache size and was affected by mountain slope aspect and density of trees. More pits were excavated in the northeast facing slopes. The density of trees negatively affects the cache volume on southwest slopes, but not on northeast slopes. The sex of the resident squirrel also affects the number of pits in the squirrel midden, with males excavating 47% more pits than females. Males and females also presented different responses to the mountain slope aspect, with females excavating more pits on northeastern slopes than on southwestern slopes, whereas male cache size did not vary with the slope aspect. Finally, the squirrel’s caching behavior did not vary in response to midden microclimate variation, a result with possible implications for the survival of the Mt Graham red squirrels, given the predicted temperature increases in the region due to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2988003698,"Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) characteristically shows few malignant cells in a microenvironment comprised of mixed inflammatory cells. Although CHL is associated with a high cure rate, recent studies have associated poor prognosis with absolute monocyte count in peripheral blood and increased monocyte/macrophages in involved lymph nodes. Thus, the role of monocytic infiltration and macrophage differentiation in the tumor microenvironment of CHL may be more relevant than absolute macrophage numbers to defining prognosis in CHL patients and potentially have therapeutic implications. Most studies identify tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) using markers (e.g., CD68) expressed by macrophages and other mononuclear phagocytes, such as monocytes. In contrast, Class A Scavenger Receptor (SR-A/CD204) is expressed by tissue macrophages but not monocytic precursors. In this study, we examined SR-A expression in CHL (n = 43), and compared its expression with that of other macrophage markers. We confirmed a high prevalence of mononuclear cells that stained with CD68, CD163, and CD14 in CHL lymph nodes. However, SR-A protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry was limited to macrophages localized in sclerotic bands characteristic of nodular sclerosis CHL. In contrast, SR-A protein was readily detectable in lymph nodes with metastatic tumor, extra-nodal CHL, T cell/histiocyte-rich large B cell lymphoma, and resident macrophages in non-malignant tissues, including spleen, lymph node, liver and lung. The results of SR-A protein expression paralleled the expression of SR-A mRNA determined by quantitative RT-PCR. These data provide evidence that tumor-infiltrating monocyte/macrophages in CHL have a unique phenotype that likely depends on the microenvironment of nodal CHL."
