https://openalex.org/W2060925737,"In mammals, circadian oscillators reside not only in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, which harbors the central pacemaker, but also in most peripheral tissues. Here, we show that the glucocorticoid hormone analog dexamethasone induces circadian gene expression in cultured rat-1 fibroblasts and transiently changes the phase of circadian gene expression in liver, kidney, and heart. However, dexamethasone does not affect cyclic gene expression in neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This enabled us to establish an apparent phase-shift response curve specifically for peripheral clocks in intact animals. In contrast to the central clock, circadian oscillators in peripheral tissues appear to remain responsive to phase resetting throughout the day."
https://openalex.org/W1993936200,"A20 is a cytoplasmic zinc finger protein that inhibits nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated programmed cell death (PCD). TNF dramatically increases A20 messenger RNA expression in all tissues. Mice deficient for A20 develop severe inflammation and cachexia, are hypersensitive to both lipopolysaccharide and TNF, and die prematurely. A20-deficient cells fail to terminate TNF-induced NF-kappaB responses. These cells are also more susceptible than control cells to undergo TNF-mediated PCD. Thus, A20 is critical for limiting inflammation by terminating TNF-induced NF-kappaB responses in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2076277955,"MyoD regulates skeletal muscle differentiation (SMD) and is essential for repair of damaged tissue. The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is activated by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a mediator of skeletal muscle wasting in cachexia. Here, the role of NF-kappaB in cytokine-induced muscle degeneration was explored. In differentiating C2C12 myocytes, TNF-induced activation of NF-kappaB inhibited SMD by suppressing MyoD mRNA at the posttranscriptional level. In contrast, in differentiated myotubes, TNF plus interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling was required for NF-kappaB-dependent down-regulation of MyoD and dysfunction of skeletal myofibers. MyoD mRNA was also down-regulated by TNF and IFN-gamma expression in mouse muscle in vivo. These data elucidate a possible mechanism that may underlie the skeletal muscle decay in cachexia."

In wild-type Arabidopsis guard cells abscisic acid, oxidative stress, cold, and external calcium elicited cytosolic calcium oscillations of differing amplitudes and frequencies and induced stomatal closure. In guard cells of the V-ATPase mutant det3 , external calcium and oxidative stress elicited prolonged calcium increases, which did not oscillate, and stomatal closure was abolished. Conversely, cold and abscisic acid elicited calcium oscillations in det3 , and stomatal closure occurred normally . Moreover, in det3 guard cells, experimentally imposing external calcium-induced oscillations rescued stomatal closure. These data provide genetic evidence that stimulus-specific calcium oscillations are necessary for stomatal closure."

As the width of the quantum point contact is increased, its electrical conductance increases in quantized steps of 2 e 2 / h , where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. The angular dependence of the electron flow on each step agrees with theory, and fringes separated by half the electron wavelength are observed. Placing the tip so that it interrupts the flow from particular modes of the quantum point contact causes a reduction in the conductance of those particular conduction channels below 2 e 2 / h without affecting other channels."

This ssrA-encoded peptide tag marks the incomplete protein for degradation by the energy-dependent ClpXP protease. Here, a ribosome-associated protein, SspB, was found to bind specifically to ssrA-tagged proteins and to enhance recognition of these proteins by ClpXP. Cells with an sspB mutation are defective in degrading ssrA-tagged proteins, demonstrating that SspB is a specificity-enhancing factor for ClpXP that controls substrate choice."
https://openalex.org/W2033674260,"Carnitine is essential for β-oxidation of fatty acids, and a defect of cell membrane transport of carnitine leads to fatal systemic carnitine deficiency. We have already shown that a defect of the organic cation/carnitine transporter OCTN2 is a primary cause of systemic carnitine deficiency. In the present study, we further isolated and characterized new members of the OCTN family, OCTN1 and -3, in mice. All three members were expressed commonly in kidney, and OCTN1 and -2 were also expressed in various tissues, whereas OCTN3 was characterized by predominant expression in testis. When their cDNAs were transfected into HEK293 cells, the cells exhibited transport activity for carnitine and/or the organic cation tetraethylammonium (TEA). Carnitine transport by OCTN1 and OCTN2 was Na+-dependent, whereas that by OCTN3 was Na+-independent. TEA was transported by OCTN1 and OCTN2 but not by OCTN3. The relative uptake activity ratios of carnitine to TEA were 1.78, 11.3, and 746 for OCTN1, -2, and -3, respectively, suggesting high specificity of OCTN3 for carnitine and significantly lower carnitine transport activity of OCTN1. Thus, OCTN3 is unique in its limited tissue distribution and Na+-independent carnitine transport, whereas OCTN1 efficiently transported TEA with minimal expression of carnitine transport activity and may have a different role from other members of the OCTN family.

It plays a physiologically important role in the β-oxidation of fatty acids by facilitating the transport of long chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial inner membrane, and its deficiency causes critical symptoms such as cardiomyopathy, skeletal muscle myopathy, and hypoglycemia (1Fritz I.B.

In mammals, carnitine, which is obtained both by biosynthesis and from the diet, is maintained at an appropriate level mainly by a high affinity Na+-dependent carnitine transport system that reabsorbs more than 95% of carnitine from the renal glomerular filtrate (2Bremer J.

Interestingly, OCTN1 and -2 in human transported organic cations such as tetraethylammonium (TEA) as well as acylcarnitines (11Wu X. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 21Yabuuchi H. Tamai I. Nezu J. Sakamoto K. Oku A. Shimane M. Sai Y. Tsuji A. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Ther. 1999; 291: 778-784PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that OCTNs may be important for the transport of xenobiotics and acylated carnitine as well as carnitine itself. By means of an in vivo disposition kinetic study of carnitine, we demonstrated that the carnitine transporters are absent or functionally deficient in jvs mice because the renal reabsorption, the intestinal absorption, and the distribution to various tissues in these mice are significantly lower than those in wild-type mice (24Yokogawa K. Higashi Y. Tamai I. Nomura M. Hashimoto N. Nikaido H. Hayakawa J. Miyamoto K. Tsuji A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 224-230PubMed Google Scholar). However, although functional loss of OCTN2 by mutation was found in jvs mice, the supplementation of carnitine or acetylcarnitine to jvs mice as well as patients improved their pathological symptoms (25Horiuchi M. Yoshida H. Kobayashi K. Kuriwaki K. Yoshimine K. Tomomura M. Koizumi T. Nikaido H. Hayakawa J. Kuwajima M. Saheki T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Engel A.G. Angelini C. Science. 1973; 179: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 27Matsuishi T. Hirata K. Terasawa K. Kato H. Yoshino M. Ohtaki E. Hirose F. Nonaka I. Sugiyama N. Ohta K. Neuropediatrics. 1985; 16: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the tissue distribution of carnitine was decreased in jvs mice, the observed tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios of carnitine in jvs mice are unity or above unity in several tissues (24Yokogawa K. Higashi Y. Tamai I. Nomura M. Hashimoto N. Nikaido H. Hayakawa J. Miyamoto K. Tsuji A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 224-230PubMed Google Scholar). Because carnitine is soluble in water and is unlikely to be transported across the cell membrane via passive diffusion, it was strongly suggested that carnitine is concentrated in several tissues of jvs mice by active transport via a transporter other than OCTN2. We preliminarily demonstrated that carnitine was indeed transported by human OCTN1 in addition to OCTN2 (21Yabuuchi H. Tamai I. Nezu J. Sakamoto K. Oku A. Shimane M. Sai Y. Tsuji A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 768-773PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is possible that additional carnitine transporters, which can partially compensate for loss of OCTN2 function, are present in human. Since carnitine metabolism is critical, it is important to clarify the transporters involved in carnitine disposition to understand the physiological roles of carnitine and to identify the cause of systemic and/or secondary carnitine deficiency. In the present study, we isolated new members of the mouse OCTN transporter family, mouse OCTN1 and OCTN3, and compared their functional characteristics as carnitine and/or organic cation transporters with those of OCTN2. [methyl-3H]Acetyl-l-carnitine hydrochloride (65 Ci/mmol) andl-[methyl-3H]carnitine hydrochloride (85 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals Inc. (Brea, CA). [1-14C]-Tetraethylammonium bromide (2.4 mCi/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). Other reagents were obtained from Sigma, Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan), or Funakoshi Co. (Tokyo, Japan). HEK293 cells were obtained from Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). Mouse OCTN2 was cloned as described previously (12Nezu J. Tamai I. Oku A. Ohashi R. Yabuuchi H. Hashimoto N. Nikaido H. Sai Y. Koizumi A. Shoji Y. Takada G. Matsuishi T. Yoshino M. Kato H. Ohura T. Tsujimoto G. Hayakawa J. Shimane M. Tsuji A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). OCTN1 and OCTN3 were cloned as follows. For OCTN1, a data base search using human OCTN1 cDNA sequence as the query identified several mouse Expressed Sequence Tags that show high homology to the query sequence. From these sequences, MONL 1 primer (5′-CGCGCCGAATCGCTGAATCCTTTC-3′) and MONA 4 primer (5′-AGGCTTTTGATTTGTTCTGTTGAG-3′) were designed and used for PCR. A cDNA fragment of around 2 kilobase pair was amplified by PCR from mouse kidney-derived cDNA. This fragment was sequenced and confirmed to have the full open reading frame of OCTN1. For OCTN3, in the course of cloning of OCTN2 by 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), we found that a cDNA fragment that was highly homologous to OCTN2, but not identical with either OCTN2 or OCTN1, was co-amplified. As this fragment was considered to be derived from an unidentified OCTN1- and OCTN2-related gene, we termed it OCTN3 and cloned its full open reading frame. MONR 2 primer (5′-CGCCCACTGCGCCCGAGTATCCTC-3′) and MONB 16 primer (5′-ATAGGCAGAGGTGATTCCAAACTT-3′) were designed from the sequences of this fragment and mouse OCTN2, respectively. Using these primers a cDNA fragment of extended OCTN3 sequence was amplified by PCR from mouse embryo (17 day)-derived Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Then MONC1 primer (5′-GTGCCTTCAGACCTACATTACTTG-3′) was designed from the newly obtained sequence and used to clone the 3′ end of OCTN3 by 3′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) from mouse testis-derived Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA (CLONTECH). The whole sequence of OCTN3 was determined by assembling these sequences. cDNA fragments covering the full open reading frame of each OCTN were re-amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Sequence-verified clones were selected and used for expression experiments. In RT-PCR analysis, following member-specific primers were used for RT-PCR. OCTN1: MONL1 primer (described above) and MONA 4 primer (described above). OCTN2: MONB 6 primer (5′-TGTTTTTCGTGGGTGTGCTGATGG-3′) and MONB 26 primer (5′-ACAGAACAGAAAAGCCCTCAGTCA-3′). OCTN3: MONR 2 primer (described above) and MONB 16 (described above). Using appropriate amounts of cDNA of a multiple tissue cDNA (MTCTM) panel (CLONTECH) derived from various mouse tissues and whole embryo as templates, each gene was amplified, and the expression levels were evaluated. For Western blot analysis, rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against synthesized polypeptides of the carboxyl termini of mouse OCTN1, -2, and -3. Amino acid sequences used for OCTN1, -2, and -3 were NH2-CGKKSTVSVDREESPKVLIT-COOH, NH2-CTRMQKDGEESPTVLKSTAF-COOH, and NH2-CKESKGNVSRTSRTSEPKGF-COOH, respectively. Mouse tissues were isolated and homogenized in 2 ml of buffer containing 210 mm sucrose, 2 mm ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 40 mm NaCl, 30 mm Hepes, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin-A, 100 μm leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinine (pH 7.4) using Polytron homogenizer. Then 800 μl of the homogenate was mixed with 750 μl of 1.17 m KCl solution containing 58.3 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate and centrifuged at 230,000 × g for 75 min. The resultant pellet was suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 230,000 × g again. The obtained pellet was suspended again in 600 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and dispersed ultrasonically. After the addition of 200 μl of 16% SDS solution, the solution was mixed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and the resultant supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. The sample was separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the membrane was incubated in buffer, 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.5) containing 10% skim milk. The membrane was incubated with respective polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies for 1 to 2 h, rinsed with above buffer without skim milk three times, and incubated with secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was washed with the above buffer without skim milk, and the proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence detection method using ECL Plus Western-blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cultured cells transfected with OCTN1, -2, or -3 were obtained as described above, harvested, and treated as the same as described for the tissue sample preparation. The full-length OCTN cDNAs were subcloned into the BamHI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the constructs, pcDNA3/OCTNs, were used to transfect HEK293 cells by means of the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (10Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin, and streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 24-h cultivation of HEK293 cells in 10-cm dishes, the cells were transfected with pcDNA3/OCTNs or pcDNA3 vector alone by adding 10 μg of the plasmid DNA/ per dish. 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and suspended in transport medium containing 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgSO4, and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). This suspension and a solution of a radiolabeled test compound in the transport medium were separately incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, then transport was initiated by mixing them. At appropriate times, 200-μl aliquots of the mixture were withdrawn, and the cells were separated from the transport medium by centrifugal filtration through a layer of a mixture of silicon oil and liquid paraffin with a density of 1.03. Each cell pellet was solubilized in 3 n KOH, then neutralized with HCl, and the associated radioactivity was measured by means of a liquid scintillation counter. HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3 vector alone were used to determine the background activity and are designated as Mock cells. Cellular protein content was determined according to the method of Bradford using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as the standard (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). In sodium-free experiments, sodium ions were replaced withN-methylglucamine, and the cells obtained were suspended in sodium-free medium. When transport was measured at acidic or alkaline pH (5.5–8.4), the pH was adjusted appropriately using HCl, NaOH, or KOH. Initial uptake rates were usually obtained by measuring the uptake at 3 or 30 min for carnitine and TEA, respectively. The uptake values were expressed as the cell-to-medium concentration (C/M) ratio (μl/mg of protein/3 min or 30 min), obtained by dividing the uptake amount in the cells by the concentration of test compound in the medium. To estimate kinetic parameters for saturable transport of carnitine or TEA, the uptake rate was fitted to the following equation by means of nonlinear least squares regression analysis using WinNonlin (Scientific Consulting Inc., Cary, NC): v = Vmax ×s/(Km + s), where vand s are the uptake rate and concentration of carnitine or TEA, respectively, and Km andVmax are the half-saturation concentration (Michaelis constant) and the maximum transport rate, respectively. All data were expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical analysis was performed by use of Student's t test. The criterion of significance was taken to be p < 0.05. Each transport study was repeated at least three times by differently transfected cells, and they essentially showed the same results, so the typical results are shown. We isolated two new members of the mouse OCTN transporter family, OCTN1 and OCTN3 (Fig. 1 a). The sequences of OCTN1 and -3 have been deposited in GenBankTM with the accession numbers AB016257 and AB018436, respectively. The full-length OCTN1, OCTN2, and OCTN3 cDNAs appeared to encode polypeptides of 553, 557, and 564 amino acids and have 73, 86, and 78% similarities with human OCTN2 (9Tamai I. Ohashi R. Nezu J.

The similarities with human OCTN1 were 84, 73, and 67%, respectively (10Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A.

The phylogenetic tree of these transporters is shown in Fig. 1 b, and it appears that the OCTNs form a distinct family of organic ion transporters. To compare the tissue distributions of OCTN1, -2, and -3, we performed RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in mouse tissues. Figs. 2,a and b, show the tissue distribution of OCTNs determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. In RT-PCR analysis of adult mouse tissues, OCTN1 and OCTN2 were clearly expressed in kidney, liver, and testis and weakly in other tissues. They were also found in embryo. On the other hand, OCTN3 was strongly expressed in testis and weakly in kidney but was hardly expressed in other tissues. Antibodies were raised against the divergent COOH-terminal portions of each protein. The polyclonal antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography and were specific for OCTN1, -2, and -3, respectively, with no cross-reaction detectable on immunoblots as shown by the immunodetection of the cell lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with mouse OCTN1, -2, or -3 (Fig. 2 b, left four lanes). Furthermore, HEK293 cells expressed all of OCTN1, -2, and -3 in significant amounts adequate for functional analysis in the following transport experiments. All antibodies recognized proteins of 64, 70, and 82 kDa for OCTN1, 70 and 80 kDa for OCTN2, and 54 and 60 kDa for OCTN3 in immunoblot of membranes from various mouse tissues. The estimated size of OCTN1, -2, and -3 from the deduced amino acid sequences were 62,287, 62,776, and 63,317, respectively. There are variations in molecular size in the detected bands, and they are close to the estimated sizes. This is presumably ascribed to the variation in post-translational modification, degradation, or glycosylation. Expression profile of OCTN2 protein was broad, and strong expression was observed in kidney. OCTN1 protein was also detected in several tissues, and kidney showed strong expression. OCTN3 was characterized by strong expression in testis and weakly in kidney without expression in other tissues. Therefore, most of the tissue expression profiles were comparable between OCTN genes and their products. Since human OCTN1 and OCTN2 transported TEA in a Na+-independent manner and carnitine in a Na+-dependent manner (9Tamai I. Ohashi R. Nezu J. Yabuuchi H. Oku A. Shimane M. Sai Y. Tsuji A. J. Biol.

Uptakes of [3H]carnitine were increased linearly up to 10 min in OCTN2- and OCTN3-transfected HEK293 cells. In OCTN1-transfected cells, [3H]carnitine uptake was very slight, but the uptake activity expressed was statistically higher than that by Mock-transfected cells after 10 min. Because the same results were obtained by differently transfected cells, OCTN1 should have low, but existing, carnitine transport activity. Uptake of [14C]TEA was increased up to 30 min by OCTN1- and OCTN2-transfected cells, whereas its uptake by OCTN3-transfected cells was negligible over 60 min. Comparison of relative transport activities of three OCTNs by correcting the expressed protein amount obtained in Western blot analysis was difficult due to the variation of titers among antibodies, although they recognize each protein specifically (Fig. 2 b). Therefore, to avoid the difference of the expression level of respective protein in cells and to allow comparison of the substrate preference among the three members, the relative transport activities for carnitine and TEA were evaluated as summarized in Table I. Here, because OCTN3 essentially is unlikely to transport TEA, we used the apparently expressed transport activity as the difference between OCTN3-transfected and Mock cells. The ratios obtained by dividing the uptake of [3H]carnitine (10 nm) by that of [14C]TEA (100 μm) at 10 min were 1.78, 11.3, and >746 for OCTN1, -2, and -3, respectively. The result suggests that OCTN3 is highly specific for carnitine, OCTN1 has a preference for TEA, and OCTN2 has intermediate specificity.Table IComparison of l-carnitine and TEA uptakes by mouse OCTNsRatio of OCTNsUptake coefficientRelative uptake (carnitine/TEA)l-Carnitine (10 nm)TEA (100 μm)μl/mg of protein/10 minOCTN114.6 ± 0.5 1-aSignificantly different from the Mock-transfected cells by Student's t test (p < 0.05).8.2 ± 0.3 1-aSignificantly different from the Mock-transfected cells by Student's t test (p < 0.05).1.78OCTN2117 ± 0.1 1-aSignificantly different from the Mock-transfected cells by Student's t test (p < 0.05).10.3 ± 0.1 1-aSignificantly different from the Mock-transfected cells by Student's t test (p < 0.05).11.3OCTN374.6 ± 0.5 1-aSignificantly different from the Mock-transfected cells by Student's t test (p < 0.05).0.1 ± 0.1746<The uptakes of l-[3H]carnitine and [14C]TEA were measured for 10 min at 37 °C in transport buffer (pH 7.4) including sodium ion.

https://openalex.org/W2130867391,"A fundamental question in aging research is whether humans and other species possess an immutable life-span limit. We examined the maximum age at death in Sweden, which rose from about 101 years during the 1860s to about 108 years during the 1990s. The pace of increase was 0.44 years per decade before 1969 but accelerated to 1.11 years per decade after that date. More than 70 percent of the rise in the maximum age at death from 1861 to 1999 is attributable to reductions in death rates above age 70. The rest are due to increased numbers of survivors to old age (both larger birth cohorts and increased survivorship from infancy to age 70). The more rapid rise in the maximum age since 1969 is due to the faster pace of old-age mortality decline during recent decades."
https://openalex.org/W2108625845,"Ubiquitination of histones has been linked to the complex processes that regulate the activation of eukaryotic transcription. However, the cellular factors that interpose this histone modification during the processes of transcriptional activation are not well characterized. A biochemical approach identified the Drosophila coactivator TAFII250, the central subunit within the general transcription factor TFIID, as a histone-specific ubiquitin-activating/conjugating enzyme (ubac). TAFII250 mediates monoubiquitination of histone H1 in vitro. Point mutations within the putative ubac domain of TAFII250 abolished H1-specific ubiquitination in vitro. In the Drosophila embryo, inactivation of the TAFII250 ubac activity reduces the cellular level of monoubiquitinated histone H1 and the expression of genes targeted by the maternal activator Dorsal. Thus, coactivator-mediated ubiquitination of proteins within the transactivation pathway may contribute to the processes directing activation of eukaryotic transcription."

After being recruited to the promoter by nuclear receptors, the p160 coactivator transmits the activating signal via two C-terminal activation domains, AD1 and AD2. AD1 is a binding site for the related coactivators cAMP-response element binding protein binding protein (CBP) and p300, whereas AD2 binds to another coactivator, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), a protein-arginine methyltransferase. The current study explored the cooperative functional and mechanistic relationships among GRIP1, CARM1, and p300 in transient transfection assays, where they enhanced the ability of the estrogen receptor (ER) to activate transcription of a reporter gene. The coactivator functions of p300 and CARM1 depended on the co-expression of GRIP1. Simultaneous co-expression of all three coactivators caused a synergistic enhancement of ER function. Deletion of the AD1 domain of GRIP1 abolished the ability of p300 to potentiate ER activity but had no effect on CARM1-mediated stimulation. In contrast, when the AD2 domain of GRIP1 was deleted, p300 still stimulated ER function through the mutant GRIP1, but CARM1 failed to do so. Thus, both binding of p300 to AD1 and binding of CARM1 to AD2 are required for their respective coactivator functions and for their synergy. Furthermore, CARM1 and p300 function independently through different activating domains of GRIP1, and their synergy suggests that they enhance transcription by different, complementary mechanisms.

In addition to the receptors for steroid and thyroid hormones, retinoic acid, and vitamin D, the superfamily includes a large number of orphan receptors for which an activating ligand is either unnecessary or unknown. The great majority of NRs share the following three similarly organized functional domains: The DNA binding domain (DBD), which is the most highly conserved domain among the NR family members, is located in the central portion of the polypeptide chain. The hormone binding domain, located at the C-terminal end, also has many common sequence motifs among different NR family members. Besides binding hormone, the hormone binding domain also contains a very important activation function, AF-2, which transmits the activating signal from the DNA-bound NR to the transcription machinery. The N-terminal domains of NRs are not conserved in size or sequence, but many of them contain another activation function, AF-1. The overall transcriptional activation by the NR is because of the combined effects of AF-1 and AF-2; the relative importance of these two activation functions depends on the specific NR, cell type, and target gene promoter. After binding to specific enhancer elements in the promoter region, NRs activate the gene by directing local remodeling of chromatin and recruiting the transcriptional initiation complex to the promoter. These events require participation of a number of cofactors called transcriptional coactivators, which interact with NRs directly or indirectly and help to transmit the activating signal to the transcription machinery by a variety of mechanisms (6Gregory P.D.

The coactivator function of CBP and p300 probably involves a variety of mechanisms, because these proteins can bind to many transcriptional activators, other coactivators, and components of the basal transcription machinery; these properties have led to the proposal that CBP and p300 may serve as scaffolds or platforms for assembly of transcriptional coactivators and that the assembled complexes may be responsible for integration of signals from multiple regulatory pathways (8Torchia J.

The second activation domain (AD2) of p160 coactivators is located near the extreme C terminus (amino acids 1122–1462 of GRIP1) (18Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Alternatively, signaling by AD2 could be accomplished by other transcriptional coactivators interacting with this domain. CARM1, which contains a histone methyltransferase activity, binds to the AD2 region of p160 coactivators and enhances transcriptional activation by NRs when it is co-expressed with a p160 coactivator (14Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether the coactivator function of CARM1 relies on the methyltransferase activity or other activation domains of CARM1. The coactivator activities of CBP/p300 and CARM1 for NRs and their abilities to bind to known activation domains of p160 coactivators suggests that these three coactivators may work in concert to mediate transcriptional activation by NRs. Because the coactivator function of CARM1 for NRs relied on the co-expression of a p160 coactivator, and because CARM1 binds to the C-terminal AD2 region of p160 coactivators (14Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar), we used specific AD1 and AD2 deletions in p160 coactivator GRIP1 to test whether the functional reliance of CARM1 on GRIP1 involved the binding of CARM1 to GRIP1 AD2. For these studies estrogen receptor (ER) α was used as the NR. Similar tests were conducted to determine whether the coactivator function of p300 for ER relied on the GRIP1 AD1 site, to which p300 binds. This question is of particular interest, because current data has not resolved whether CBP and p300 act as coactivators through direct contact with NRs, through their interaction with the AD1 region of p160 coactivators, or both. CBP and p300 have been shown to bind directly to ER and other NRs and in some studies enhanced NR function in the absence of co-expressed p160 coactivators (22Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J.

On the other hand, deletion of AD1 has been shown to eliminate CBP and p300 binding and to cause a substantial reduction in the coactivator activity of p160 coactivators (12Chen H. Lin R.J.

Use of the AD1 and AD2 deletion mutants of GRIP1 also allowed us to determine whether the coactivator functions of CARM1 and p300 depended on, or were independent of, each other. In addition, because they all serve as NR coactivators and can physically interact, we tested whether the effects of GRIP1, p300, and CARM1 on ER function were synergistic, additive, or redundant. Proteins with N-terminal hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope tags were expressed in transient mammalian cell transfections and in vitro from pSG5.HA, which has SV40 and T7 promoters (14Chen D. Ma H. Hong H.

The following proteins were expressed from previously described pSG5.HA derivatives: GRIP1, SRC-1a, and CARM1 (14Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar); GRIP1ΔAD1 (full-length GRIP1 with amino acids 1057–1109 deleted) and GRIP1ΔAD2 (GRIP15–1121) (21Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.-M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Vector pSG5.HA-GRIP1ΔAD1+ΔAD2 was constructed as follows: The C-terminal region was removed from the wild type pSG5.HA-GRIP1 vector by using a natural XhoI site at codon 765 and the XhoI site in the vector's cloning site following the GRIP1 stop codon. A new C-terminal GRIP1 cDNA fragment containing the AD1 and AD2 deletion mutations was generated by PCR using pSG5.HA-GRIP1ΔAD1 as a template. The downstream primer for the PCR reaction included a stop codon and a SalI site after codon 1121. This PCR product was cut at the natural XhoI site at codon 765 and at the new SalI site and ligated with the XhoI sites of the pSG5.HA-GRIP1 vector fragment described above, thus generating pSG5.HA-GRIP1ΔAD1+ΔAD2. Plasmids encoding Gal4 DBD fused to various GRIP1 fragments were constructed by subcloning the following cDNA fragments into theEcoRI-SalI sites of pM (CLONTECH): an EcoRI-XhoI fragment encoding GRIP15–765 and a PCR-generatedEcoRI-SalI fragment encoding GRIP1563–1121. pM.GRIP11122–1462 (pM.GRIP1c) was described previously (14Chen D.

The pcDNA3.p300 expression vector for p300 was kindly provided by Dr. Vittorio Sartorelli (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). CV-1 cells (31Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar) were transfected, and cell extracts were assayed for luciferase and β-gal activity essentially as described previously (14Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Approximately 18 h prior to transfection, 5 × 104 CV-1 cells were seeded into each well of 12-well dishes. Cells were transiently transfected by the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's protocol with a total amount of 1.0 μg of plasmid DNA per well, including 50 ng of pCMV.βgal, included as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency. 2 h after transfection, 20 nm estradiol or an equivalent volume of the ethanol vehicle was added to the medium containing charcoal-treated serum (Gemini Bio Products). Approximately 48 h after transfection, cell extracts were made and assayed for luciferase and β-gal activity as described previously (15Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.-M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The luciferase data, expressed as relative light units (RLU), shown are the mean and standard deviation for triplicate points and are representative of at least three independent transfection experiments. Because some of the coactivators enhance the activity of the cytomegalovirus promoter and many other so-called constitutive promoters, β-gal activity was determined to monitor the uniformity of transfection efficiency, but the luciferase activities were not normalized with the β-gal activity. To explore the functional relationships among GRIP1, p300, and CARM1, we examined their abilities to enhance transcriptional activation by ER in transient transfection assays. Different combinations of the three coactivators were co-expressed with ER in CV-1 cells, and their effect on the expression of an ER-regulated reporter plasmid was measured. In addition, GRIP1 mutants lacking AD1 (the binding site for p300), AD2 (the binding site for CARM1), or both were substituted for wild type GRIP1. This strategy allowed us to address several questions. First, does the coactivator function of p300 with ER depend on its ability to bind the AD1 region of p160 coactivators, or does p300 act through direct contact with ER? Second, does the coactivator function of CARM1 depend on its ability to bind the AD2 region of p160 coactivators. Third, are the coactivator functions of p300 and CARM1 independent of each other? Fourth, are the coactivator effects on ER function by GRIP1, p300, and CARM1 synergistic? As expected, ER enhanced the expression of a transiently transfected reporter gene in an estrogen-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A, histograms 1and 2). As previously reported (14Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar), exogenous expression of CARM1 alone (i.e. in the absence of a co-expressed p160 coactivator) had little effect on reporter gene activation by ER (Fig. 1 A, histogram 4). Similarly, no enhancement of activity was observed when p300 alone was co-expressed with ER in the absence of a co-expressed p160 coactivator (histogram 3), and varying amounts of the p300 expression vector, from 25 to 500 ng, had no effect (Fig. 2 A,unfilled histograms). Co-expression of CARM1 and p300 resulted in a slight enhancement of ER function (Fig. 1 A,histogram 5). In contrast, co-expression of GRIP1 with ER elevated reporter gene activity 3.5-fold (compare histograms 2 in Fig. 1, A and B), and this activity was hormone-dependent (Fig. 1 B, histograms 1 and 2). When co-expressed with GRIP1, p300 enhanced ER function 2-fold, and CARM1 caused a 3-fold enhancement (Fig. 1 B, histograms 2–4). The effect of p300 increased along with the dose of p300 expression vector (Fig. 2 A, filled histograms). Thus, neither p300 nor CARM1 functioned independently as a coactivator for ER but required the co-expression of GRIP1. Similar results were obtained when another p160 coactivator, SRC-1a, was substituted for GRIP1 in this system (data not shown).Figure 2Coactivator functions of p300 and CARM1 for ER are dependent on GRIP1 but independent of each other. Transient transfections were performed with MMTV(ERE)-LUC (125 ng) and 2.5 ng of ER expression vector. Estradiol (20 nm) and expression vectors encoding coactivators were included as indicated for eachpanel. A, coactivator expression vectors were as follows: GRIP1 (125 ng, where indicated) and p300 (variable amount, as indicated). B, coactivator expression vectors were as follows: GRIP1ΔAD1 (250 ng, where indicated), CARM1 (250 ng, where indicated), p300 (variable amount, as indicated). C, coactivator expression vectors were as follows: GRIP1ΔAD2 (125 ng, where indicated), p300 (125 ng, where indicated), and CARM1 (variable amounts, as indicated).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the presence of ER plus GRIP1 simultaneous co-expression of CARM1 and p300 produced a 9-fold enhancement of reporter gene activity (Fig. 1 B, compare histograms 2 and 5); this activity was completely eliminated by omission of either GRIP1 (comparehistograms 5 in Fig. 1, A and B), ER, or estradiol (data not shown). In the presence of GRIP1 the enhancement of ER function by p300 and CARM1 together was about twice the sum of their separate effects, indicating that they were acting synergistically as coactivators. The synergy was more dramatic when lower levels of ER expression vector were used in the transfections. 2Y.-H. Lee and M. R. Stallcup, manuscript in preparation. Under such conditions, neither CARM1 nor p300 effectively enhanced the reporter gene activity observed with ER plus GRIP1; each one caused an enhancement of 2-fold or less (Fig. 3,A and B, points on y axis). However, expression of both CARM1 and p300 caused a dramatic enhancement (up to 30-fold) of ER-dependent reporter gene activity (Fig. 3). The synergistic enhancement depended on the amount of p300 and CARM1 expression vectors used, when one was held constant and the other was varied. The dramatic synergistic enhancement caused by p300 and CARM1 was almost entirely dependent on the presence of GRIP1, ER, and estradiol (data not shown). Both p300 and CARM1 bound to specific regions of p160 coactivators (12Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

These findings suggest that the coactivator functions of p300 and CARM1 depend on their ability to bind specific regions of p160 coactivators. To test this hypothesis further, we used GRIP1 deletion mutants (21Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.-M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell.

Reporter gene activation by ER was enhanced by the GRIP1ΔAD1 mutant (comparehistograms 2 in Fig. 1, A and C); further enhancement was caused by co-expression of CARM1 with GRIP1ΔAD1 but not by co-expression of p300, either in the presence or absence of CARM1 (Fig. 1 C). Co-transfection of various amounts of p300 expression vector failed to enhance the activity observed with CARM1 and GRIP1ΔAD1, and high doses of p300 vector caused partial inhibition (Fig. 2 B). The GRIP1ΔAD2 mutant enhanced ER function (compare histograms 2, Fig. 1, A and D), and further enhancement was achieved by co-expression of p300 (Fig. 1 D,histogram 3). However, co-expression of CARM1 with GRIP1ΔAD2 failed to enhance reporter gene activity either in the presence or absence of"

In this study, we demonstrate that BCR/ABL inhibits the expression of a key cell cycle inhibitor, p27Kip1, by signaling through a pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). p27Kip1 is a widely expressed inhibitor of cdk2, an essential cell cycle kinase regulating entry into S phase. We demonstrate that the decrease of p27Kip1 is directly due to BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells by two different approaches. First, induction of BCR/ABL by a tetracycline-regulated promoter is associated with a reversible down-regulation of p27Kip1. Second, inhibition of BCR/ABL kinase activity with the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 rapidly increases p27Kip1 levels. The PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 blocks the ability of BCR/ABL to induce p27Kip1down-regulation and inhibits BCR/ABL-induced entry into S phase. The serine/threonine kinase AKT/protein kinase B is a known downstream target of PI3K. Transient expression of an activated mutant of AKT was found to decrease expression of p27Kip1, even when PI3K was inhibited by LY-294002. The mechanism of p27Kip1 regulation is primarily related to protein stability, since inhibition of proteasome activity increased p27Kip1 levels in BCR/ABL-transformed cells, whereas very little change in p27 transcription was found. Overall, these data are consistent with a model in which BCR/ABL suppresses p27Kip1protein levels through PI3K/AKT, leading to accelerated entry into S phase. This activity is likely to explain in part previous studies showing that activation of PI3K was required for optimum transformation of hematopoietic cells by BCR/ABL in vitro and in vivo.

Unlike many other leukemia oncogenes, BCR/ABL does not appear to alter differentiation of granulocyte lineage cells. In contrast, recent studies have suggested that the major cellular effects of BCR/ABL are related to increased mitogenic activity (5Puil L. Liu J. Gish G. Mbamalu G. Bowtell D. Pelicci T.G.

There are three known breakpoints in the gene, resulting in three different protein products, p190, p210, and p230, which vary in the length of Bcr present in the fusion protein (8Quackenbush R.C. Reuther G.W. Miller J.P. Courtney K.D. Pear W.S. Pendergast A.M. Blood. 2000; 95: 2913-2921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the three proteins tend to be associated with different leukemias: ALL, CML, and chronic neutrophilic leukemia, respectively, for p190, p210, and p230BCR/ABL. Each of the BCR/ABL proteins have elevated Abl tyrosine kinase activity (9Konopka J.B. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell.

The mitogenic effects of BCR/ABL are likely to be important in the pathogenesis of CML. BCR/ABL reduces growth factor requirements of primary hematopoietic stem cells (18Sanchez-Garcia I. Grutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5287-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), converts IL-3-dependent murine hematopoietic cell lines to growth factor independence (19Mandanas R.A. Boswell H.S. Lu L. Leibowitz D. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1992; 6: 796-800PubMed Google Scholar), and is mitogenic in fibroblasts (20Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Witte O.N. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). When compared with normal progenitor cells, CML progenitor cells are more likely to be in S phase, both in the marrow and blood, and the fraction of cells in G0 is reduced (21Eaves A.C. Cashman J.D. Gaboury L.A. Kalousek D.K. Eaves C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5306-5310Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, BCR/ABL is likely to deregulate checkpoints at one or more sites within the cell cycle. Previous studies have shown that several immediate-early genes are induced by BCR/ABL, including myc (22Sawyers C.L. Callahan W. Witte O.N. Cell. 1992; 70: 901-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), fos, andjun (23Mandanas R.A. Leibowitz D.S. Gharehbaghi K. Tauchi T. Burgess G.S. Miyazawa K. Jayaram H.N. Boswell H.S. Blood. 1993; 82: 1838-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid induction of these genes correlates with an enhanced rate of transition from G0 to G1. The increased fraction of cells in S phase suggests that G1/S transition checkpoints are also suppressed. A number of molecules play a key role in regulating cell cycle progression from G1 to S, including the G1cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs). CKIs can be grouped in two categories based on similarities of sequence and actions: the INK4 family (p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d) and the CIP/KIP family (p21WAF1/CIP1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2), reviewed in Sherr and Roberts (24Sherr C.J.

INK4 family members specifically inhibit the activity of cdk4 and 6, whereas the CIP/KIP family members have a broader action. Overexpression of each of these CKI have been shown to induce a G1 arrest. p21CIP1 has recently been directly shown to be important for regulating hematopoiesis in vivo in mice (25Cheng T. Rodrigues N. Shen H. Yang Y. Dombkowski D. Sykes M. Scadden D.T. Science. 2000; 287: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 26Mantel C. Braun S.E. Reid S. Henegariu O. Liu L. Hangoc G. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1999; 93: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although PI3K and AKT have previously been reported to play essential roles in BCR/ABL transformation (27Skorski T. Bellacosa A. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Majewski M. Martinez R. Choi J.K. Trotta R. Wlodarski P. Perrotti D. Chan T.O. Wasik M.A. Tsichlis P.N. Calabretta B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6151-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), the mechanisms and downstream signaling targets have been unclear. PI3K and AKT have been linked to enhanced cell survival through the phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bad (28Neshat M.S. Raitano A.B. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, it has been difficult to demonstrate phosphorylation of Bad in some cell types transformed by BCR/ABL, so identification of other downstream targets is of interest. In the present study we demonstrate that BCR/ABL regulates the expression of p27Kip1 in a proteasome-dependent manner and through activation of PI3K and AKT. Anti-Abl monoclonal antibody 3F12 was a gift from R. Salgia (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). Monoclonal antibodies against p27Kip1 (K25020) and Rb (14001A) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Pharmingen/Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA). Anti-p85 antiserum (06–195) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-HA monoclonal was purchased from Babco (Richmond, CA). AKT constructs, inserted in a pCDNA3.1 backbone, were described previously (29Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). RNase A, lactacystine, andN-acetyl-leucyl-leucine norleucinal (LLnL) were purchased from Sigma. E64 and calpain inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. The IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mg/ml l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (WEHI-3B-CM) as a source of IL-3. Ba/F3 is commonly used as a model for BCR/ABL signaling because it is non-leukemic and factor-dependent in the absence of BCR/ABL-transformation but becomes leukemic in syngeneic mice and factor-independent after transformation by BCR/ABL. p210BCR/ABL-transformed Ba/F3 cells (Ba/F3-p210) are maintained in culture in the medium described above, except without IL-3. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Ba/F3 cells expressing the reverse tet-transactivator pUHD172–1 (Ton.B.1) and Ton.B.210 cells in which p210BCR/ABL expression is induced by the addition of doxycycline were obtained from G. Daley (Whitehead institute, Cambridge, MA) and grown as described previously (30Gesbert F. Griffin J. Blood. 2000; 96: 2269-2276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments using transiently transfected cells, 1 × 107 cells were transfected by electroporation (Gene-Pulser Bio-Rad, 960 microfarads, 350V). 40 μg of the indicated plasmids were cotransfected with 10 μg of a pEGFP plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). 24-h post-transfection, the green fluorescent protein-expressing cells were sorted on a high speed cell sorter (Coulter Electronics, Miami, FL). After sorting, cells were pelleted, resuspended in culture medium, and kept in culture for 24 h with or without treatment as indicated. For protein analysis, cells were harvested, washed in PBS and lysed at 5 × 107 cells/ml in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNaVO3, 1 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin) for 30 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay, and equivalent amounts of proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Filters were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with either 5% nonfat dry milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.5% Tween (TBS-T). Filters were washed three times in TBS-T and incubated for 1 h with optimal concentrations of primary antibodies diluted in TBS, 0.1% Tween. After four additional washes in TBS-T, filters were further incubated 45 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Visualization was performed using PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Renaissance system and Kodak X-Omat blue film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Ton.B.210 cells were either left untreated or treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for at least 24 h before cycloheximide treatment in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% WEHI-CM. 8 h before treatment, the cells were harvested, washed twice in 1× PBS, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin at a cell density of 1 × 106cells/ml with or without doxycycline. After 8 h of IL-3 deprivation, 10 μm cycloheximide was added to the culture, and an aliquot of the cells was harvested at the indicated times. Cells were lysed as described above. For cell cycle analysis, cells were treated as specified. 1–2 × 106 cells were harvested, washed once in 4 ml of PBS, and fixed in 1 ml of 70% ethanol solution. Fixed cells were kept at −20 °C and stained just before analysis. For staining, fixed cells were pelleted, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of propidium iodide-staining solution (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 100 units/ml RNase A added extemporaneously). Cells were left in propidium iodide staining solution for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed immediately. DNA content and hence the cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry. Repartition of the cells in the various stages of cell cycle was determined with cell cycle analysis software. For cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 250 μm each dNTP, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 50 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 2.5 μm random hexamers, and 1× buffer (1.5 mmMgCl2) (all reagents were purchased from PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The reaction mix was incubated at 42 °C for 45 min and then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min. For each sample, a control reaction not containing the reverse transcriptase enzyme was also performed. Specific primers and probe for p27 (forward: 5′-GGTGGACCAAATGCCTGACT-3′; reverse: 5′-GCCCTTTTGTTTTGCGAAGA-3′; probe: 5′ AATCTTCTGCCGCAGGTCGCTTCC-3′) were designed from sequences in the GenBankTM data base using the Primer Express 1.0 Software (PE Applied Biosystems). The hybridization probe spanned an intron to exclude annealing to genomic DNA. The gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as endogenous control to standardize the amount of RNA in each reaction (Taqman Rodent GAPDH control reagents). All primers and probes were synthesized by PE Applied Biosystems. PCR was performed on the cDNA samples using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector (PE Applied Biosystems). The Taqman® PCR Core reagent kit (PE Applied Biosystems) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol with the modification that dUTP was replaced by dTTP, and incubation with AmpErase was omitted. For each sample tested, PCR reaction was carried out in a 50-μl volume containing 1 μl of cDNA reaction (equivalent to 50 ng of template RNA) and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold. Oligonucleotide primers and fluorogenic probe were added to a final concentration of 100 nm each. The amplification step consisted of 60 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 65 °C for 1 min. In each experiment, additional reactions with 7 serial 2-fold dilutions of Ton.B.210 cDNA, prepared from cells induced or not with doxycycline, as template were performed with each set of primers and probes on the same 96-well plate to generate standard curves, which related the threshold cycle (CT) to the log input amount of template. All samples were amplified in triplicate. The relative amount of p27 transcripts in each sample was determined by using the standard curve method and by normalizing for GAPDH mRNA expression levels, as described previously (ABI PRISM sequence detection system user bulletin No. 2 (PE Applied Biosystems and Ref. 31Fink L. Seeger W. Ermert L. Hanze J. Stahl U. Grimminger F. Kummer W. Bohle R.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1329-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The ability of BCR/ABL to promote survival and proliferation in the absence of growth factors has been well documented in certain hematopoietic-derived cell lines. The Ba/F3 cell line used in our studies is a pre-B cell fully dependent on the presence of IL-3 for survival and proliferation. IL-3 withdrawal for 16 h induces a partial G1 arrest in parental Ba/F3 cells but not in Ba/F3 cells transformed by p210BCR/ABL (Fig. 1, upper panels). Similar results were obtained with the previously described Ton.B.210 cell line (Fig. 1, lower panels). This cell line, derived from Ba/F3 cells, expresses p210BCR/ABL in response to the addition of doxycycline in the culture medium. After withdrawal of IL-3 for 16 h, non-induced Ton.B.210 cells arrest at G0/G1, whereas BCR/ABL-expressing Ton.B.210 cells progress through G1 to S phase (Fig. 1, lower panels). These results demonstrate that BCR/ABL expression regulates cell cycle progression in hematopoietic cells in a manner similar to cytokine stimulation. Based on these results, we sought to identify cell cycle-related proteins that might be regulated by BCR/ABL activity. The Ton.B.210 cell line was used to assure that changes were specifically due to BCR/ABL and not due to unrelated mutations in the cultured cell lines. Cells were left untreated or stimulated with doxycycline for 24 h and IL-3-deprived for 16 h. Immunoblotting of p27 on lysates from non-treated or doxycycline-treated Ton.B.210 cells demonstrated that resting, non-induced cells expressed a high amount of the CKI p27Kip1, whereas BCR/ABL-expressing cells displayed a very low amount of p27Kip1(Fig. 2 A). In addition, p21Cip1 expression levels were higher in proliferating cells.(Fig. 2 A, lower panel). Discordant expression levels of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 has also been described in other proliferating cells (32Li Y. Jenkins C.W. Nichols M.A. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2261-2268PubMed Google Scholar). In some circumstances, CKIs can promote rather than inhibit the formation of active cyclin D-cdk4 complexes (33Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 34LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Our data would be consistent with a model in which the increased level of p21Cip1expression is enough to participate in the activation of cyclin D-cdk4 but is not high enough to inhibit cyclinE-cdk2. In contrast to p27Kip1, there was no variation of expression of cyclins A, E, D1, or D3 (data not shown). These results suggest that regulation of p27Kip1 expression by BCR/ABL might be an important mechanism in BCR/ABL-mediated proliferative signaling. To confirm that p27Kip1 down-regulation was directly due to BCR/ABL activity, doxycycline-induced Ton.B.210 cells were treated for 14 h with increasing concentrations of the small molecule Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (Fig. 2 B). At an optimal concentration of 1 × 10−6mSTI571, BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited, and this was accompanied by a substantial increase in p27Kip1expression. In these experiments, the level of expression of the 85-kDa subunit of PI3K was used as a control for equal loading of gel lanes. The results described above indicated that p27Kip1 might be an important target for BCR/ABL in deregulating cell cycle control mechanisms, and therefore, we next sought to identify the signaling pathway responsible for p27Kip1 expression. As an initial screen, three drugs that inhibit different signaling pathways were studied: PD98059, LY-294002, and rapamycin, known to specifically inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K, and p70S6K pathways, respectively. Treatment of p210BCR/ABL-expressing Ba/F3 cells with carrier alone (Me2SO) or with PD98059 had no effect on cell cycle progression (Fig. 3 A, upper panels), whereas treatment for 14 h with either LY-294002 or rapamycin induced a G0/G1 arrest, without any significant effect on cell viability (note the absence of a sub-G1population in Fig. 3 A, lower panels). The effects of these three drugs on BCR/ABL-induced expression of p27Kip1 was then investigated (Fig. 3 B). Treatment of Ba/F3p210BCR/ABL with LY-294002 induced a dramatic increase of p27Kip1 expression, whereas a treatment with rapamycin and PD98059 had no effect. Since rapamycin effectively induces a G1 arrest in these cells, it is unlikely that the p27Kip1 up-regulation induced by LY-294002 is simply a consequence of cell cycle arrest. As p27Kip1 is a known inhibitor of the pRb kinase cdk2, we also sought to determine if pRb was found in a hyperphosphorylated form in BCR/ABL-expressing cells and if this phosphorylation was regulated by PI3K. As shown in Fig. 3 C, hyper- (ppRb) and hypo- (pRb) phosphorylated forms of Rb can be distinguished by an electrophoretic shift on a 6.5% SDS-PAGE. Ba/F3 p210 cells displayed almost exclusively a hyperphosphorylated form of Rb. Although PD98052, rapamycin, or Me2SO had no or little effect on Rb phosphorylation, treatment of Ba/F3 p210 cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 had a dramatic effect, with Rb reverting to an almost exclusively hypophosphorylated state. These results demonstrate that the PI3K pathway regulates p27Kip1 expression and Rb phosphorylation, most likely through the well known ability of p27Kip1 to regulate cdk2 activity. The serine/threonine kinase AKT/protein kinase B is a downstream mediator of PI3K activity. In an effort to determine if AKT activity was sufficient to mediate down-regulation of p27Kip1, an AKT mutant rendered constitutively active by membrane targeting through the fusion of a CAAX box (HA-AKT-CAAX), was transiently expressed in the BCR/ABL-inducible cell line, Ton-B-210. The Ton-B-210 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and either a wild-type AKT construct (HA-AKT-WT), as control, or HA-AKT-CAAX construct. Twenty-four hours after transfection, GFP-positive cells were isolated by flow cytometry and then maintained in culture for an additional 24 h either in the absence or presence of doxycycline in order to induce BCR/ABL expression. The cells were then IL-3-deprived for 18 h and lysed. As shown in Fig. 4 A, IL-3 deprivation of cells without BCR/ABL leads to a dramatic increase of p27Kip1expression in cells transfected either with an empty vector or with a vector encoding for a wild-type form of AKT. Expression of an activated form of AKT or BCR/ABL, however, led to a significant and equivalent decrease of p27Kip1 expression. These results suggest that activation of AKT, a known consequence of BCR/ABL signaling, is sufficient in these cells to regulate p27Kip1expression. To determine if AKT functions downstream of PI3K in the regulation of p27Kip1 expression in Ba/F3 cells, activated AKT was expressed in BCR/ABL-transformed cells in which PI3K had been inhibited by LY-294002 (Fig. 4 B). Ba/F3-p210 cells were co-transfected as above with plasmids encoding GFP and either wild type or the activated form of AKT. After isolation of GFP-positive cells by flow sorting, the positive cells were allowed to recover for an additional 18 h and then either left untreated or were treated with LY-294002 or rapamycin. The expression of the constitutively active form of AKT (HA-AKT-CAAX) completely inhibited the increase of p27Kip1 expression induced by LY-294002, whereas the expression of a wild type form (HA-AKT-WT) had no detectable effect. These results indicate that AKT can regulate p27Kip1expression in hematopoietic cells and that it is likely downstream of PI3K activity, because an activated AKT mutant can override the effect of PI3K inhibition on p27Kip1 expression. In other cell systems, p27Kip1 regulation of expression has been shown to occur at both transcriptional and postranscriptional levels (35Servant M.J. Coulombe P. Turgeon B. Meloche S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In some cells, p27Kip1 has been shown to be ubiquitinated and thereby targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation (36Podust V.N. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Luo R.S. Wang C. Coggins M.B.

Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1997; 11: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To determine if BCR/ABL-induced p27Kip1 down-regulation is mediated by a protein degradation pathway, we studied several protease inhibitors and two different proteasome inhibitors, lactacystine andN-acetyl-leucyl-leucine norleucinal. As shown in Fig. 5 A, after a 5-h treatment, both proteasome inhibitors specifically induced an increase of p27Kip1 expression in Ba/F3-p210 cells, whereas the protease inhibitors had little or no effect. To further investigate possible degradation of p27Kip1, Ton.B.210 cells, induced or not with doxycycline, were treated with 10 μmribosomal complex inhibitor cycloheximide. By blocking translation with cycloheximide, the role of post-translational events such as degradation in regulating protein levels can be specifically evaluated. Lysates of the cells were prepared at different time points of treatment. Equivalent amounts of protein were loaded on SDS-PAGE and probed with an anti- p27Kip1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 B, we clearly show that the disappearance of p27Kip1 protein is faster in BCR/ABL-expressing cells (Fig. 5 B, lower panel) than in non-induced cells (Fig. 5 B, upper panel), suggesting a faster degradation of p27Kip1 in BCR/ABL-expressing cells. After densitometry analysis of the bands, the half-life of p27Kip1 was estimated to be longer than 8 h in non-induced cells and 2 h in BCR/ABL- expressing cells. These results suggest that p27Kip1 protein down-regulation in BCR/ABL-transformed cells is likely to be due predominantly to proteasome-dependent degradation and that this process is regulated by PI3-kinase and AKT. In other cells, p27Kip1 has also been shown to be regulated at the level of transcription (35Servant M.J. Coulombe P. Turgeon B. Meloche S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 39Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Therefore, p27Kip1RNA levels were compared before and after induction of BCR/ABL in Ton.B.210 cells using semiquantitative real time PCR, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Treatment of Ton.B.210 cells with doxycycline in presence or in absence of LY-294002 resulted in a les"

Many proteins are specifically lost from nuclei, and others are taken up from the egg cytoplasm.

https://openalex.org/W2087388421,"Gender dimorphism and polyploidy are important evolutionary transitions that have evolved repeatedly in many plant families. We show that gender dimorphism in North American Lycium (Solanaceae) has evolved in polyploid, self-compatible taxa whose closest relatives are cosexual, self-incompatible diploids. This has occurred independently in South African Lycium. We present additional evidence for this pathway to gender dimorphism from 12 genera involving at least 20 independent evolutionary events. We propose that polyploidy is a trigger of unrecognized importance for the evolution of gender dimorphism, which operates by disrupting self-incompatibility and leading to inbreeding depression. Subsequently, male sterile mutants invade and increase because they are unable to inbreed."

A major consequence of hyperglycemia is increased oxidative stress. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) plays an essential role in the regulation of oxidative stress by primarily regulating NADPH, the main intracellular reductant. In this paper we show that increased glucose (10–25 mm) caused inhibition of G6PD resulting in decreased NADPH levels in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Inhibition was seen within 15 min. High glucose-induced inhibition of G6PD predisposed cells to cell death. High glucose via increased activity of adenylate cyclase also stimulated an increase in cAMP levels in BAEC. Agents that increased cAMP caused a decrease in G6PD activity. Inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ameliorated the high glucose-induced inhibition of G6PD. Finally, high glucose stimulated phosphorylation of G6PD. These results suggest that, in BAEC, high glucose stimulated increased cAMP, which led to increased protein kinase A activity, phosphorylation of G6PD, and inhibition of G6PD activity.

Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (22937) Google Scholar). Thus it is critical to understand how hyperglycemia leads to cellular damage. Hyperglycemia-induced increases in oxidative stress have been suggested to be of central pathogenic importance (3Low P.A. Nickander K.K. Tritschler H.J.

An increase in oxidative stress may be due to an increase in processes that produce oxidants or due to a decrease in antioxidant defenses. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD),1 the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, is required for the antioxidant defense system because it produces NADPH, the cells' principal reductant (5Tian W.-N.

Previous research from our laboratory has shown that G6PD, an enzyme traditionally thought to be under little post-translational control, is regulated both in its activity and intracellular location by specific signal transduction molecules (7Tian W.-N.

Importantly, our laboratory has also shown that modest changes in G6PD activity itself have significant effects on cell growth and cell death in a variety of cell types (5Tian W.-N. Braunstein L.D.

Thus proper activity of G6PD is required for adequate defense against oxidative stress and prevention of cell damage/death. Previous researchers have shown that the pentose phosphate pathway (as measured by release of radioactively labeled CO2) was impaired after exposure to high glucose. Asahina et al. (10Asahina T. Kashiwagi A. Nishio Y. Ikebuchi M. Harada N. Tanaka Y. Takagi Y. Saeki Y. Kikkawa R. Shigeta Y. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) showed that when human umbilical endothelial cells in high glucose (33 mm) were exposed to H2O2 the expected increase in pentose phosphate pathway activity was almost completely inhibited as compared with cells incubated in normal glucose conditions (5 mm). The data suggested that high glucose predisposes cells to oxidative damage because of inadequate activation of the pentose phosphate pathway after exposure to an oxidant. G6PD per se was not evaluated in this study, nor was the mechanism of high glucose effect on G6PD reported. Thus we hypothesized that under high glucose conditions impaired activity of G6PD would predispose cells to oxidant damage and cell death. The data reported in this paper support the previous studies (10Asahina T. Kashiwagi A. Nishio Y. Ikebuchi M. Harada N. Tanaka Y. Takagi Y. Saeki Y. Kikkawa R. Shigeta Y. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and provide mechanistic information by showing that inhibition of G6PD occurs at least in part by high glucose-stimulated increases in cAMP levels. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma. G6PD antibody was a generous gift from Rolf Kletzien (Upjohn). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were grown in DMEM + 10% calf serum. Cells were used between passages 5 and 10. Cells were harvested by scraping and then lysed in a buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline + 5% Nonidet P-40, and in protease inhibitors. G6PD activity of the lysates was measured as described previously except that substrate concentrations were 500 μm glucose 6-phosphate and 250 μm NADP+ (7Tian W.-N. Pignatare J.N. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell death was measured by trypan blue exclusion as has been done previously (6Tian W.-N. Braunstein L.D. Apse K. Pang J. Rose M. Tian X. Stanton R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1121-C1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis was measured by 4′,6′-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride as described previously (6Tian W.-N. Braunstein L.D. Apse K. Pang J. Rose M. Tian X. Stanton R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1121-C1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NADPH was measured by a new method designed by us (11Zhang Z., Yu, J. Stanton R.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In brief, the method is based on the fact that only NADH and NADPH (and not NAD+ and NADP+) affect absorbance at 340 nm. Cell extracts are separated into 3 aliquots (A1, A2, and A3). A1 is untreated and the absorbance at 340 nm is measured. A2 is treated with an enzyme that converts all of the NADP+ to NADPH, and then the absorbance at 340 nm is measured. A3 is treated with an enzyme that converts all of the NADPH to NADP+, and then the absorbance at 340 nm is measured. A1 − A3 is the NADPH content, and A2 − A1 is the NADP+ content of the extract. BAEC, which were 80–90% confluent, were incubated with 5.5 and 25 mm glucose for 3 h. GSH was measured using the GSH kit BIOXYTECH GSH-400 from OXIS International, Inc. ROS were measured as described previously using the dye 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (6Tian W.-N. Braunstein L.D. Apse K. Pang J. Rose M. Tian X. Stanton R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1121-C1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dichlorofluorescein fluorescence was measured using a microplate fluorometer (Cambridge Technology). BAEC were incubated with 5.5 and 25 mm glucose for 3 h. Adenylate cyclase activity was measured by a new method designed by us. The method is based on relative differences between two cell lysates rather than absolute activities. Cell lysates either from cells exposed to 5 mm glucose or lysates from cells exposed to 25 mm glucose were prepared. Then each lysate was separated into two aliquots (A and B). To be certain there was no limitation on substrate availability, ATP (the substrate for adenylate cyclase) was added to each aliquot, and then aliquot A was immediately boiled for 10 min. Aliquot B was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then boiled for 10 min. Then cAMP was measured using cAMP kit TRK432 from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Isobutylmethylxanthine (1 mm) was included in all solutions to inhibit cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase activity. The amount of cAMP from aliquot A represents the base-line cAMP level. The difference between the cAMP amount in aliquot B and in aliquot A (i.e. B − A) represents the adenylate cyclase-produced cAMP. In the figures, the results are expressed as the increase in cAMP (aliquot B cAMP − aliquot A cAMP level). BAEC that were 80% confluent were exposed to 1 mCi of 32P/P100 culture plate in phosphate-free buffer for 2 h. Then the glucose concentration was increased by adding glucose to the plate. After 3 h cells were harvested and lysed, and G6PD was immunoprecipitated using antibody to G6PD as described previously (5Tian W.-N. Braunstein L.D. Pang J. Stuhlmeier K. Xi Q.-C. Tian X. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10609-10617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Following immunoprecipitation, G6PD protein was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then exposed to x-ray film. Antisense experiments were done with the excellent assistance of Drs. Jane Alexander and Joseph Loscalzo of the Boston University Medical Center, who provided both the antisense sequence and suggestions on transfection techniques. Transfection was carried out using the method described by the Sequitur, Inc. kit. In brief, BAEC, which were 80–90% confluent, were washed once with Opti-MEM without serum or antibiotics. Then 13.2 μl of Oligofectin I (stock solution, 2 mg/ml) was added in 1 ml of Opti-MEM in a polystyrene tube. In another tube 4.0 μl of antisense oligomer was added to 1 ml of Opti-MEM. The two solutions were mixed together and allowed to sit for 15 min. The mixture was then added to cells for 5 h. 0.5 ml of mixture was added to each well of a 24-well plate. After 5 h of incubation, the medium was removed, and Opti-MEM with 10% serum was added to the cells for 24 h. Experiments were then started at this time. The antisense sequence we used was 5′-AGUAGUACCCACGUAGCCCACUGGGA-3′. After transfection, BAEC were incubated with 5.5 and 25 mm glucose for 24 h. Then, cell death and G6PD activity were measured as described above. Vascular endothelial cells are known targets of hyperglycemia. Thus we have used BAEC, a commonly used system, for the studies. BAEC were incubated with various concentrations of glucose. Cells were harvested, and cell lysates were obtained as described previously (7Tian W.-N. Pignatare J.N. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stanton R.C. Seifter J.L. Boxer D.C. Zimmerman E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stanton R.C. Seifter J.L. Boxer D.C. Zimmerman E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12442-12448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows that glucose concentrations as low as 10 mm were sufficient to inhibit G6PD activity. As an osmotic control another sugar, raffinose, was added to medium containing 5.5 mm glucose to achieve the same concentrations as seen with the high glucose conditions. Raffinose had no effect on G6PD activity (data not shown). Also note that a raffinose control was done for all the remaining experiments and in all cases did not cause any of the effects seen with increased glucose. High glucose has been shown to increase cell death in BAEC (12Morishita R. Nakamura S. Nakamura Y. Aoki M. Moriguchi A. Kida I. Yo Y. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Higaki J. Ogihara T. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1 B, increased glucose led to cell death. To further determine an association between G6PD activity and BAEC cell death, two inhibitors of G6PD were used. Both dehydroepiandrosterone (5Tian W.-N. Braunstein L.D. Pang J. Stuhlmeier K.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C1121-C1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) worsened cell death at all glucose levels. Importantly there was a close correlation with impaired G6PD activity and cell death (Fig. 1, compare A andB). If high glucose-induced cell death is due, at least in part, to impaired activity of G6PD, then cells exposed to high glucose should be more susceptible to oxidant-induced cell death. Fig. 1 C shows that H2O2-induced cell death was significantly enhanced in cells exposed to high glucose. We have recently published that G6PD activity can affect apoptosis in a variety of cell types including BAEC (6Tian W.-N. Braunstein L.D. Apse K. Pang J. Rose M. Tian X. Stanton R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1121-C1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because high glucose led to an increase in cell death we explored whether there was an increase in apoptosis. Fig. 1 D shows that high glucose increased apoptosis in BAEC. Considering the relative lack of specificity of the G6PD inhibitor, DHEA, we more specifically addressed the role of G6PD by using an antisense oligonucleotide to reduce G6PD activity. Fig. 2 A shows that both in normal and high glucose conditions transfection with an antisense sequence led to a highly significant decrease in G6PD activity. Note that the decrease in G6PD activity was greater in the BAEC exposed to high glucose. Also the transfection efficiency for the Sequitur Oligofectin system is about 30%. As is clear from the results in Fig. 2 A, there is almost a 60% decrease in G6PD activity following transfection. Although we have no specific answer as to why there is such a profound decrease, it is our belief that there is on-going cell death, which leads to release of the oligonucleotide and subsequent transfection of other cells over time. This observation and idea as to the reason for the profound effect on G6PD activity was also seen and suggested by a collaborator. 2J. Loscalzo, personal communication. Fig. 2 B shows that the antisense sequence also led to a significant enhancement of the cell death especially under high glucose conditions. These results strongly support an important role for G6PD in high glucose-induced cell death. We have previously shown that inhibition of G6PD by pharmacologic agents led to a decrease in NADPH levels and an increase in ROS (5Tian W.-N. Braunstein L.D. Pang J. Stuhlmeier K. Xi Q.-C. Tian X.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C1121-C1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3, A and B, shows that a high glucose-induced inhibition of G6PD also led to a decrease in NADPH and an increase in ROS. Because NADPH is the critical substrate required to maintain reduced levels of glutathione, we also measured GSH levels under normal and high glucose conditions. Fig. 3 C shows that high glucose also led to a decrease in GSH levels consistent with our findings on NADPH.Figure 1A, high glucose causes inhibition of G6PD activity. Concentrations as low as 10 mm glucose as early as 15 min after exposure are sufficient to suppress G6PD activity. BAEC were initially grown in DMEM (5.5 mmglucose) + 10% serum that were about 80% confluent and then switched to DMEM with 2% serum plus various concentrations of glucose ranging from 5.5 to 25 mm for 15 min to 24 h. The same experiment done on confluent cells yielded similar results as shown above. All subsequent figures use the same approach with slight changes in either percent confluence or incubation time. The data were normalized by protein and presented as average ± S.E. from three separate experiments, each run in at least triplicate (*,p < 0.01; **, p < 0.005 compared with control). B, high glucose and G6PD inhibitors increase cell death as measured by trypan blue exclusion. High glucose increased cell death. Inhibition of G6PD enhanced BAEC cell death. BAEC were treated as in Fig. 1 A (except used at 60% confluent), switched to DMEM + 2% serum and glucose for 24 h, and then exposed to an inhibitor of G6PD (either 100 μm DHEA or 5 mm6-aminonicotinamide (ANAD) for 3 h. Data were normalized by cell number and expressed as means ± S.E. of 10 separate experiments, each run in triplicate (***, p < 0.001 compared with control). C,H2O2 enhances cell death in the presence of high glucose. BAEC were prepared as described in B. Then cells were treated with 400 μmH2O2 for 3 h. Cell death was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Data were normalized by cell number and expressed as means ± S.E. of five separate experiments, each run in triplicate (***, p < 0.001; ****, p< 0.0001 compared with control). D, high glucose increases apoptosis. Apoptosis was measured by 4′,6′-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride after 12 h of incubation to glucose ± 100 μm DHEA and 5 mm6-aminonicotinamide (ANAD).

First, increased glucose leads to an increase in cAMP levels (13Kamal K. Du W. Mills I. Sumpio B.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Second, increased cAMP has led to enhancement of cell death in certain cell types (13Kamal K. Du W. Mills I. Sumpio B.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Third, Costa Rosa et al. (14Costa Rosa L.-F.B.P. Curi R. Murphy C. Newsholme P. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that compounds that increase cAMP levels led to a decrease in G6PD activity from rat peritoneal macrophages. Fig. 4 A shows that high glucose caused highly significant increases in cAMP. The high glucose-induced increase in cAMP in BAEC could be due to either increased adenylate cyclase activity and/or to decreased phosphodiesterase activity. Fig. 4 B shows that high glucose led to an increase in adenylate cyclase activity. Considering the significant increase in adenylate cyclase activity in Fig. 4 B and the more modest increase in cAMP in Fig. 4 A, it is likely that phosphodiesterase activity is increased as well. If increased cAMP leads to inhibition of G6PD, then pharmacologically induced increases in cAMP should lead to inhibition of G6PD activity. Fig. 4 C shows that isobutylmethylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, led to inhibition of G6PD activity. Fig. 4 D shows that an analog of cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, also led to inhibition of G6PD activity. These results confirm that increased cAMP levels cause inhibition of G6PD activity in BAEC. cAMP is believed to cause most of its effects via cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). H89 is an inhibitor of PKA activity. If PKA is inhibiting G6PD then inhibition of PKA should lead to an increase in G6PD activity. Fig. 5 A shows that H89 led to an increase in G6PD activity. To determine whether PKA acts directly on G6PD, PKA was incubated with G6PD in cell lysates. Fig. 5 Bshows that incubation of the catalytic subunit of PKA with G6PDin vitro led to inhibition of G6PD. If PKA is acting directly on G6PD, then high glucose should cause phosphorylation of G6PD. Fig. 5 C shows that high glucose led to a highly significant increase in phosphorylation. There is compelling evidence that G6PD is the principal source of NADPH utilized in redox regulation. First, under oxidative stress conditions many studies have shown that G6PD and the pentose phosphate pathway are routinely elevated (15Slekar K.H. Kosman D.J. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16Ursini M.V. Parella A. Rosa G. Salzano S. Martini G. Biochem.

Toxicol. 1995; 10: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Second, Pandolfi et al. (24Pandolfi P.P. Sonati F. Rivi R. Mason P. Grosveld F. Luzzatto L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5209-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) used homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells to produce a cell line totally deficient in G6PD. The G6PD null cells were exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress. In addition the null cells had significantly decreased growth rates as compared with cells expressing G6PD and significantly reduced cloning efficiencies. The authors concluded that G6PD was critical for NADPH production and was the principal source of NADPH. Earlier work by Rosenstraus and Chaisin (18Rosenstraus M. Chaisin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using a G6PD-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line, which was produced through classic mutagenesis techniques, also showed that the G6PD-deficient cells were more susceptible to oxidative stress. Recently Ursini and colleagues (19Salvemini F. Franze A. Iervolino A. Filosa S. Salzano S. Ursini M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) overexpressed G6PD in Hl-60 cells and showed that the glutathione levels in the cell were elevated and the cells were more resistant to oxidative stress. Taken together, these results show that G6PD activity is of central importance to cellular redox regulation. Thus Fig. 3 A shows that the decrease in NADPH caused by high glucose is consistent with the fact that decreased activity of G6PD is the mechanistic reason for this decrease. The redox level in the cell is a balance between reductants and oxidants. Intracellular increases in ROS can be due to exposing cells to external oxidants such as H2O2 and diamide (20Fisher, A. B. (1988) in Upjohn Symposium on Oxygen Radicals, Park City, UT, January 24–30, 1988 (Cerrutti, P., Fridovich, I., and McCord, J. M., ed) pp. 34–38, New York.Google Scholar, 21Fridovich, I.

B. (1988) in Upjohn Symposium on Oxygen Radicals, Park City, UT, January 24–30, 1988 (Cerrutti, P., Fridovich, I., and McCord, J. M., ed) pp. 34–38, New York.Google Scholar, 21Fridovich, I.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). ROS can be formed by normal biologic reactions via the actions of a variety of intracellular oxidases such as xanthine oxidase, monoamine oxidase, NADPH oxidase, and urate oxidase (20Fisher, A. B. (1988) in Upjohn Symposium on Oxygen Radicals, Park City, UT, January 24–30, 1988 (Cerrutti, P., Fridovich, I., and McCord, J. M., ed) pp. 34–38, New York.Google Scholar, 21Fridovich, I.

Nonenzymatic production of ROS can also occur. Superoxide may be formed from the auto-oxidation by molecular oxygen (21Fridovich, I. (1988) in Upjohn Symposium on Oxygen Radicals, Park City, UT, January 24–30, 1988 (Cerrutti, P., Fridovich, I., and McCord, J. M., ed.) pp. 1–5, New York.Google Scholar, 22Fridovich I. J. Biol.

(1988) in Upjohn Symposium on Oxygen Radicals, Park City, UT, January 24–30, 1988 (Cerrutti, P., Fridovich, I., and McCord, J. M., ed) pp. 34–38, New York.Google Scholar, 21Fridovich, I.

ROS can also be produced in cellular compartments such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, and microsomes (20Fisher, A. B. (1988) in Upjohn Symposium on Oxygen Radicals, Park City, UT, January 24–30, 1988 (Cerrutti, P., Fridovich, I., and McCord, J. M., ed) pp. 34–38, New York.Google Scholar, 21Fridovich, I.

The consequences of increased oxidative stress include oxidation of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids that lead to defects in metabolism, cell growth, and other cell physiologic processes (20Fisher, A. B. (1988) in Upjohn Symposium on Oxygen Radicals, Park City, UT, January 24–30, 1988 (Cerrutti, P., Fridovich, I., and McCord, J. M., ed) pp. 34–38, New York.Google Scholar, 21Fridovich, I.

Proteins involved in redox regulation are glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. All of these enzymes require a reductant for their operation. The main intracellular reductant is NADPH, which is principally produced by G6PD (23Simonian N.A. Coyle J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 24Pandolfi P.P. Sonati F. Rivi R. Mason P. Grosveld F. Luzzatto L.

Foellmi L.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The next enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway is also a dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, which also produces NADPH. However, the activity of this enzyme is completely dependent on G6PD as G6PD is the sole source of the substrate for this enzyme (6-phosphogluconate). There is one other enzyme that produces NADPH, NADP+-dependent malate dehydrogenase. In most cells this enzyme cannot replace G6PD as the principal source of NADPH. However, in liver, adipose tissue, pancreatic β-cells, and macrophages NADP+-dependent malate dehydrogenase may play a significant role in NADPH production. Thus in most cells, proper activity of G6PD is required for the cell to properly defend against oxidative stress. Thus the results in Fig. 3 B showing increased ROS following exposure to high glucose are likely due, at least in part, to decreased G6PD activity. The evidence that oxidative stress plays a role in the complications of diabetes mellitus is as follows (3Low P.A. Nickander K.K. Tritschler H.J.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar), and increased aldose reductase, are all associated with increased oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress may be a unifying factor for all of these mechanisms. Thus there is strong evidence that increased oxidative stress is of major importance in the etiology of diabetic complications. Recent work by our laboratory has shown that G6PD activity per se is important for proper cell growth (5Tian W.-N. Braunstein L.D. Pang J. Stuhlmeier K. Xi Q.-C. Tian X. Stanton R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10609-10617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and preventing cell death under various conditions (6Tian W.-N. Braunstein L.D. Apse K. Pang J. Rose M. Tian X. Stanton R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1121-C1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular cell death caused by oxidative stress was dependent on G6PD levels. Thus the results seen in this paper and our previously published studies are consistent with the hypothesis that altered G6PD activity (caused by high glucose) would predispose cells to cell damage/death. In particular, the studies using the G6PD inhibitors and the antisense oligonucleotide to G6PD strongly support an important role for G6PD in high glucose cell death. In 1975, Zawalich et al. (30Zawalich W.S. Karl R.C. Ferrendelli J.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetologia. 1975; 11: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that increased glucose led to an increase in cAMP in pancreatic islets. In 1978, Jackowski et al. (31Jackowski M.M. Tepperman H.M. Tepperman J. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1978; 4: 323-333PubMed Google Scholar) showed that rats exposed to high glucose had increased cAMP levels in their adipose tissue. More recently, Kamal et al. (13Kamal K. Du W. Mills I. Sumpio B.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showed that increased cAMP likely played an antiproliferative role in human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line. Thus there is published evidence for high glucose causing an increase in cAMP levels. The results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 are consistent with these previous observations. Fig. 4 Bsuggests that a mechanism underlying this effect is at least in part due to increased activation of adenylate cyclase. Interestingly, the effect may differ depending on cell type. For example human corneal cells exposed to increased glucose showed a decrease in cAMP levels (32Wang H.Z. Wu K.Y. Lin C. Fong J.C. Hong S.J. Kaohsiung J. Med. Sci. 1997; 13: 566-571PubMed Google Scholar). The different responses of cAMP levels may truly reflect cell-specific responses or they may reflect different experimental conditions (e.g. incubation time may play a role). Further studies are required to clarify this. As previously noted, Costa Rosa et al. (14Costa Rosa L.-F.B.P. Curi R. Murphy C. Newsholme P. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that cAMP could inhibit macrophage G6PD. However, they suggested that this was true for only macrophage G6PD. Costa Rosa et al. (14Costa Rosa L.-F.B.P. Curi R. Murphy C. Newsholme P. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) compared their findings on macrophage G6PD to only one other source of G6PD. Thus they did not do an extensive study of various sources of G6PD. The research reported here suggests that cAMP inhibition of G6PD is not limited to macrophages. Thus it is possible that cAMP might regulate G6PD in a variety of cell types. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that in BAEC, high glucose led to an increase in cAMP that, via cAMP-dependent PKA, caused phosphorylation and inhibition of G6PD activity. This led to decreased NADPH, increased ROS, and then cell damage/death. This impaired activity of G6PD likely plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of endothelial cell damage observed in patients with diabetes. We are very grateful to Chun-Rui Zhao for excellent technical assistance in the phosphorylation experiments and to Jia Yu for excellent technical assistance and critical suggestions. We are also very grateful to Drs. Joseph Loscalzo and Jane Leopold of the Boston University Medical Center for their assistance in the antisense experiments."

They regulate diverse biological cellular functions such as cellular growth, differentiation, and development.The activities and cellular signaling of the TGF-β superfamily are regulated through multiple mechanisms. Intracellularly, for example, inhibitory Smad proteins, Smad6 and Smad7, act as ligand-inducible inhibitors of signal transduction (2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). Extracellularly, multiple binding proteins for the TGF-β family have been characterized as regulators of TGF-β signaling. Follistatin regulates all aspects of the biological activities of activin (3Nakamura T. Takio K. Eto Y. Shibai H. Titani K. Sugino H.

Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). The activities of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are regulated by BMP-binding proteins such as chordin, noggin, the cerberus/Dan families, and follistatin (6Pearce J.J. Penny G. Rossant J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Among the binding proteins, follistatin is biochemically the best characterized. Follistatin binds activin with high affinity (Kd = 50–500 pm) and prevents activin from binding to its own receptors (4de Winter J.P. ten Dijke P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E.

Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19432-19437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby neutralizing the biological activity of activin. Follistatins undergo multiple levels of modifications such as glycosylation and proteolytic processing, and can be purified as proteins with multiple molecular heterogeneity (8Sugino K. Kurosawa N.

The major species of follistatins are follistatin 315 (FS-315) and follistatin 288 (FS-288), which are generated by alternative splicing events from the common precursor gene (8Sugino K. Kurosawa N.

Koba A. Ling N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the splicing isoform FS-288, which has stronger activin inhibitory functions than FS-315, triggers the endocytotic degradations of activin, thereby completely blocking its biological activities (10Hashimoto O. Nakamura T. Shoji H. Shimasaki S. Hayashi Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13835-13842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Follistatin also acts as a BMP-binding protein, although the affinity of follistatins for BMPs is lower than that of follistatins for activins (11Iemura S. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C. Uchiyama H. Natsume T. Shimasaki S. Sugino H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9337-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The binding proteins for activin and BMPs play significant roles in the process of neural induction in early development and in the regulation of hormonal homeostasis in endocrine organs (12Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Kelly O.G. Melton D.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 283-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of chordin, noggin, or follistatins inXenopus embryos induces neuronal tissues via a default pathway (11Iemura S. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C. Uchiyama H. Natsume T. Shimasaki S. Sugino H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9337-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Kelly O.G. Melton D.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 283-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar).Structurally, follistatins are composed of a signal peptide, followed by the NH2-terminal domain and three follistatin domains (FS domains) (13Shimasaki S. Koga M. Esch F. Cooksey K. Mercado M. Koba A. Ueno N. Ying S.Y. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4218-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). FS domains consist of ∼70 amino acids, have 10 conserved cysteine residues, and are presumed to serve as growth factor binding motifs (14Okabayashi K. Shoji H. Onuma Y. Nakamura T. Nose K. Sugino H. Asashima M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These domains are found in various secreted proteins, including follistatins, follistatin-related protein (FRP, also known as TGF-β-stimulatable clone, TSC-36) (15Tanaka M. Ozaki S. Osakada F. Mori K. Okubo M. Nakao K. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 1305-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Zwijsen A. Blockx H. Van A.W. Willems J. Fransen L. Devos K. Raymackers J.

FASEB J. 1994; 8: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), agrin, and matrix glycoprotein SC1(18). Among the proteins that contain FS domains, only follistatins are reported to bind TGF-β family members (3Nakamura T. Takio K. Eto Y. Shibai H. Titani K. Sugino H. Science. 1990; 247: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SPARC binds the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor and regulates their activities (19Raines E.W. Lane T.F. Iruela A.M. Ross R. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 20Kupprion C. Motamed K. Sage E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29635-29640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Since the TGF-β family and the platelet-derived growth factor family are dimeric proteins and belong to the family of proteins containing cystine knot motifs (21McDonald N.Q. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 421-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), proteins containing FS domains are likely to recognize the common binding pockets found in the TGF-β family and the platelet-derived growth factor family.In this paper, we report the identification of a mouse follistatin-like protein, which is most likely a mouse homologue of human follistatin-related gene (FLRG). The FLRG protein contains two FS domains and acts as a binding protein for activin and BMP-2.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe the identification of mouse follistatin-like protein, which is likely to be a mouse homologue of human FLRG. FLRG contains two FS domains and is a binding protein for activin and BMP-2. We have previously shown that follistatins are binding proteins for activin (3Nakamura T. Takio K. Eto Y. Shibai H. Titani K. Sugino H. Science. 1990; 247: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 10Hashimoto O. Nakamura T. Shoji H. Shimasaki S. Hayashi Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13835-13842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Follistatin binds activin with high affinity and regulates all aspects of activin bioactivity. Other than follistatins, α2-macroglobulin and a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily bind activin (32Vaughan J.M. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2038-2050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Krummen L.A. Woodruff T.K. DeGuzman G. Cox E.T. Baly D.L. Mann E. Garg S. Wong W.L. Cossum P. Mather J.P.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4745-4752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, their affinities for activin are low and they are unable to neutralize the bioactivity of activin. They are likely to act as molecules that deliver activins to the site of action or to be involved in clearance of activin. Like follistatins, FLRG binds activin with high affinity and neutralizes the biological activity of activin. Thus, FLRG is the second activin-binding protein shown to inhibit the activity of activin.The mFLRG protein has a domain organization similar to that of follistatin, which suggests that the genes encoding these two proteins belong to the same family. A preliminary analysis of the mFLRG gene indicates that the genomic organizations of follistatin and FLRG are similar, except that the FLRG gene lacks the exon encoding one FS domain, which is missing from FLRG (data not shown). Interestingly, Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool data base searches show that the FS domain is very similar to the domain of Kazal type serpins (35Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2983) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that follistatins have intrinsic protease inhibitor activity. It is interesting to note that proteins of the serpin family act as binding proteins for activins and BMPs (34McFarlane J.R. Foulds L.M. O'Connor A.E. Phillips D.J. Jenkin G. Hearn M.T. de Kretser D.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4745-4752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the tertiary structure of FS domains and serpins might be similar, and activin and BMPs are likely to recognize the similar molecular architecture of these domains.Two isoforms of follistatin (FS-315 and FS-288) are generated from one gene by alternative splicing events, and these isoforms have different affinities for the cell surface (7Nakamura T. Sugino K. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19432-19437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FS-288 has higher affinity for heparan sulfate proteoglycan and associates with the cell surface. Interestingly, unlike follistatins, FLRG lacks the heparin binding site (Fig. 1 C). In accordance with this finding, we could not detect any apparent association of FLRG protein with heparin-Sepharose (data not shown). Since heparin or sulfate cellulofine column was used in our previous procedure to purify follistatins from porcine and human follicular fluids, it is unlikely that our previous follistatin preparation contained FLRG protein. It remains to be determined whether FLRG attaches to the cell surface via proteoglycans, in a similar way to FS-288. However, since the acidic Glu-rich domain at the COOH terminus of FS-315 prevents the binding of heparan sulfate to FS-315 (29Inouye S. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Yamane Y. Tohno-oka R. Yamada S. Furuya S. Shiokawa K. Hirabayashi Y. Sugino H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7375-7381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and FLRG also contains an acidic Glu-rich domain at the COOH terminus, it is unlikely that FLRG associates with heparan sulfate proteoglycan. The affinity of FS-288 for activin is higher than that of FS-315 for activin, explaining the strong inhibitory activity of FS-288 on activins (31Hashimoto O. Kawasaki N. Tsuchida K. Shimasaki S. Hayakawa T. Sugino H. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The affinity of FLRG for activin A is lower than that of FS-288 for activin A, and close to that of FS-315 for activin A. Furthermore, FLRG resembles FS-315 in that both contain COOH-terminal Glu-rich acidic regions. In that sense, FLRG is more similar to FS-315 than to FS-288. However, the proposed heparin binding region found in the first FS domains of follistatins (FS-315 and FS-288) is not found in FLRG (Fig. 1 C). Thus, even FLRG and FS-315 differ in their mode of association with heparin, and also possibly with activin (29Inouye S. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).We have identified the region of FLRG that is involved in the association with activin A. Interestingly, the COOH-terminal domain, which includes the second FS domain and the short acidic COOH-terminal region, clearly showed binding to activin, whereas the first FS domain did not show detectable binding. Thus, although structurally similar, the two FS domains of FLRG have different functions. Identification of the factor(s) that may be capable of binding to the first FS domain will help to clarify the additional functions of FLRG. Our preliminary studies indicate that the COOH-terminal region of FS-288, which includes the third FS domain, is not involved in activin binding. Thus, the modes of association of FS-288 and FLRG with activin are likely to be different. A previous report suggested the involvement of both the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions of follistatin in activin binding (37Schneyer A.L. Rzucidlo D.A. Sluss P.M. Crowley Jr., W.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, one report suggests that the COOH-terminal acidic region of FS-315 may be responsible for the different modes of interaction of FS-315 and FS-288 with activins (38Sumitomo S. Inouye S. Liu X.J. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since the NH2-terminal domain of FLRG preceding the first FS domain is structurally similar to that of follistatins, this domain may also have a functional role in FLRG activity like follistatin (37Schneyer A.L. Rzucidlo D.A. Sluss P.M. Crowley Jr., W.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In accordance with this speculation, we found that the whole molecular structure is important for the complete inhibitory effect of FLRG (data not shown). The finding that a truncated FLRG protein that lacks the NH2-terminal region clearly shows activin binding on ligand blotting (Fig. 3) suggests an auxiliary role for the NH2-terminal region of FLRG in the activity of the protein. A similar observation was recently reported for the BMP antagonist chordin. The cysteine-rich domains (CRs) are the BMP-binding modules in chordin. Two CRs are found to bind BMPs, but the activity of individual CRs is lower than that of full-length chordin. Thus, the cysteine-rich regions of follistatins and chordin are likely to have common roles in activin and/or BMP binding.Recently, the binding site on the type II activin receptor has been identified through alanine scanning mutation of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the receptor (39Gray P.C. Greenwald J Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S. Donaldson C.J. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3206-3212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A cluster of three hydrophobic residues (Phe-42, Trp-60, and Phe-83) that are important for activin binding to its receptors was identified. FSs (FS and FLRG) and activin receptors do not show any significant homology to each other. However, FS domains contain cysteine-rich regions, as do the extracellular domains of activin receptors. Thus, it is likely that the spacing of cysteines and the tertiary structures found in FS domains and activin receptors play an important role in growth factor association.Recombinant mouse FLRG protein produced in mammalian cells inhibited activin A-induced signaling in human K562 cells and CHO cells (Fig. 4). We have used two reporters, 3TP-lux and CAGA-lux. The effects of FLRG on both reporters are similar: FLRG inhibits activin signaling. Thus, FLRG is the member of the activin-binding protein family that neutralizes activin biological activities extracellularly.More recently, we and others have shown that follistatin is capable of binding to BMPs (11Iemura S. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C. Uchiyama H. Natsume T. Shimasaki S. Sugino H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9337-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 40Smith W.C. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 3-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the affinity of follistatin for BMPs is lower than that of follistatin for activins (the estimatedKd is approximately 23 nm), follistatin neutralizes all the functions of BMPs when overexpressed inXenopus embryos (11Iemura S. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C. Uchiyama H. Natsume T. Shimasaki S. Sugino H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9337-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Recent reports also suggest that follistatin is likely to act as a binding protein not only for activins but also for other members of the TGF-β family, including BMP subfamily members such as BMP-7 and growth and differentiation factor 9 (41Guo Q. Kumar T.R. Woodruff T. Hadsell L.A. DeMayo F.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this study, we also analyzed the effects of FLRG on BMP binding and BMP-mediated signaling. Interestingly, FLRG shows binding to BMP-2 similar to that of follistatins (Fig. 2 C). The affinity of FLRG for BMP-2 is close to that of follistatin for BMP-2 (Fig. 2 C). Although the affinity of FLRG to BMP-2 is low, we can detect the association of BMP-2 with GST-C, which have both of the two FS domains of FLRG by ligand blotting (data not shown). In order to study the effect of FLRG on BMP-2 responsiveness, we have used the luciferase construct SBE4-lux in astrocyte cell lines. The reporter construct contains 4 repeats of Smad binding elements and responds not only to activin/TGF-β but also to BMPs (26Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The elements are presumed to serve as binding sites for Smad4, which is a common mediator Smad for all the members of the TGF-β family (26Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 27Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). In accordance with this finding, the SBE4 reporter is activatable not only by activin/TGF-β but also by BMPs. FLRG protein inhibited BMP-2-induced transcriptional response in BMP-responsive RNB cells (Fig. 5). Recently, the role of BMPs in the generation of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes from embryonic neural progenitor cells has been documented (42Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Thus, it is an attractive hypothesis that follistatins (follistatin and FLRG) might be involved in the process by regulating the activities of BMPs.The mode of interaction of follistatins with BMP is different from that of follistatins with activins (11Iemura S. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C. Uchiyama H. Natsume T. Shimasaki S. Sugino H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9337-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Whereas complexes containing follistatin and activin dissociate from activin receptors, tertiary complexes containing follistatin, BMP, and BMP receptor exist (4de Winter J.P. ten Dijke P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E. Sugino H. de Waele P. Huylebroeck D. Verschueren K. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Iemura S. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C. Uchiyama H. Natsume T. Shimasaki S. Sugino H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9337-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Whether the modes of interaction of FLRG with activin and with BMPs are different is a subject for future study.We have shown that FLRG mRNA is highly expressed in heart, lung, kidney, and testis in mouse (Fig. 6 A) and abundantly expressed in placenta, heart, testis, ovary, adrenal gland, and lung in human (Fig. 6 B). Recent investigations using follistatin-overexpressing transgenic mice suggest that follistatin exerts its functions mainly in a paracrine and/or autocrine manner (41Guo Q. Kumar T.R. Woodruff T. Hadsell L.A. DeMayo F.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). FLRG is also likely to act as an autocrine/paracrine factor to modulate the activities of activins and BMPs in these organs. The expression of follistatin mRNA is rather ubiquitous when compared with that of FLRG mRNA (Fig. 6 C). The temporal and spatial expression of follistatin and FLRG is likely to regulate the activities of activins and BMPs differently. Since follistatins and FLRG are secreted proteins that act as endocrine regulators, they may act at sites remote from the site of mRNA production. Future studies should determine the expression site(s) of FLRG protein by the use of specific antibodies raised against the protein.Activin and BMPs are multifunctional growth and differentiation factors that belong to the TGF-β superfamily. Activin has numerous biological activities: regulation of secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone from pituitary cells, stimulation of differentiation of erythroblasts, and mesoderm induction in Xenopus embryos. BMPs were originally discovered by virtue of their ability to induce ectopic bone formation. Subsequent investigations indicate that the action of BMPs is not limited to bone formation. BMPs act as mesoderm inducers both in amphibians and in mammals. BMPs are also involved in apoptosis in rhombomere formation and digit formation and pattern formation in early development. BMPs, in collaboration with leukemia inhibitory factor, induce the generation of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes from embryonic neural progenitor cells and specify the generation of glial cell lineages (41Guo Q. Kumar T.R. Woodruff T. Hadsell L.A. DeMayo F.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The diverse biological activities of BMPs are regulated by multiple BMP-binding proteins.Our findings that multiple members of the follistatin family (follistatin and FLRG) act as binding proteins for activin and BMPs not only shed new light on the molecular diversity of proteins containing FS domains, but also suggest that the regulatory mechanisms of activin/BMP biological signaling are more dynamic and complex than thought previously. The members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 superfamily includes TGF-βs, activin, inhibin, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (1Vale W. Rivier C. Hsueh A. Campen C. Meunier H. Bicsak T. Vaughan J. Corrigan A. Bardin W. Sawchenko P. Petraglia F. Plotsky P. Spiess J. Rivier J. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1988; 44: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar). They regulate diverse biological cellular functions such as cellular growth, differentiation, and development. The activities and cellular signaling of the TGF-β superfamily are regulated through multiple mechanisms. Intracellularly, for example, inhibitory Smad proteins, Smad6 and Smad7, act as ligand-inducible inhibitors of signal transduction (2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). Extracellularly, multiple binding proteins for the TGF-β family have been characterized as regulators of TGF-β signaling. Follistatin regulates all aspects of the biological activities of activin (3Nakamura T. Takio K. Eto Y. Shibai H. Titani K. Sugino H. Science. 1990; 247: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 4de Winter J.P. ten Dijke P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E. Sugino H. de Waele P. Huylebroeck D. Verschueren K. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Signaling by TGF-β is regulated by decorin (5Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). The activities of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are regulated by BMP-binding proteins such as chordin, noggin, the cerberus/Dan families, and follistatin (6Pearce J.J. Penny G. Rossant J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Among the binding proteins, follistatin is biochemically the best characterized. Follistatin binds activin with high affinity (Kd = 50–500 pm) and prevents activin from binding to its own receptors (4de Winter J.P. ten Dijke P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E. Sugino H. de Waele P. Huylebroeck D. Verschueren K. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura T. Sugino K. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19432-19437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby neutralizing the biological activity of activin. Follistatins undergo multiple levels of modifications such as glycosylation and proteolytic processing, and can be purified as proteins with multiple molecular heterogeneity (8Sugino K. Kurosawa N.

The major species of follistatins are follistatin 315 (FS-315) and follistatin 288 (FS-288), which are generated by alternative splicing events from the common precursor gene (8Sugino K. Kurosawa N.

Relaxation of this weak zone after tectonic perturbations transfers stress to the overlying crust, generating a sequence of earthquakes that continues until the zone fully relaxes. Simulations predict large (5 to 10 meters) slip events with recurrence intervals of 250 to 4000 years and cumulative offsets of about 100 meters, depending on material parameters and far-field stress magnitude. Most are consistent with earthquake magnitude, coseismic slip, recurrence intervals, cumulative offset, and surface deformation rates in the New Madrid Seismic Zone. Computed interseismic strain rates may not be detectable with available geodetic data, implying that low observed rates of strain accumulation cannot be used to rule out future damaging earthquakes."

Samples collected from sediments with ages between 1.8 and 6 million years ago consistently yield ages around 55 million years ago. These ages, together with the strong iodine enrichment observed in the pore waters, suggest that the origin of iodine is related to organic material of early Tertiary age, which probably is also the source of the methane in the gas hydrates at this location."

We recorded the synaptic activity of DSGCs using strategies to observe the asymmetric inhibitory inputs that underlie the generation of direction selectivity. The critical nonlinear interactions between the excitatory and inhibitory inputs took place postsynaptically within the dendrites of the DSGCs."

The huntingtin interacting protein (HIP-1) was identified by its altered interaction with mutant huntingtin. However, the function of HIP-1 was not known.

HIP-1 is also homologous to a Caenorhabditis elegans gene of unknown function, ZK370.3. Motif searches predicted two domains in HIP-1, a coiled-coil domain and a domain with homology to the protein talin. However, the function of HIP-1 in mammalian cells is unknown. Proteins interacting with huntingtin are predicted to contribute to the normal activity of huntingtin and potentially play a role in the neurodegenerative changes observed in HD.

In this study, we report a novel function for HIP-1 that is directly related to apoptosis. Expression of HIP-1 dramatically promotes cell death in transfected cells. Importantly, the severity of HIP-1 toxicity is influenced by the mutation in HD, namely the size of the polyglutamine tract. The molecular basis of HIP-1 toxicity resides in a novel death effector domain (DED) and is dependent on a specific phenylalanine residue at position 398. HIP-1 toxicity requires caspases, including caspase 3, and induces the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. These results provide insight into the normal activity of HIP-1 and raise the possibility that HIP-1 may be a molecular accomplice in the pathogenesis of HD. The identification of human HIP-1 cDNA by yeast two-hybrid analysis and cloning into the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega) was described in Kalchmanet al. (3Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B.

The 5′-end of the HIP-1 sequence was extended by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from human total brain RNA (CLONTECH) using Superscript II reverse transcriptase, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). The sense primer 5′-GCCTCGGTCATGGATGTGAGCAAGATG-3′, encompassing the Kozak consensus sequence and ATG start site of splice variant HIP1–2 (28Chopra V.S. Metzler M. Rasper D. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E.

Subsequently, aNotI–KpnI fragment containing full-length HIP-1 was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega) forin vitro studies. The DED expression construct, corresponding to amino acids 376–457 in HIP-1, was amplified using the sense primer 5′-CTAGAGCCACCATGGGCCACGTCAGCGAGCTG-3′, which included a Kozak consensus sequence, initiating methionine, and XbaI restriction site for subcloning, and the antisense primer, 5′-GCCGCCTACAGATCTTCTTCACTTATTAGTTTTTGTTCCACCTCTGCATTCTTCCG-3′, which included the sequence for the c-Myc epitope tag, a termination codon, and a NotI restriction site. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), sequenced, and then resubcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI. Three HIP-1 DED mutants, E397G, F398G, and F398Y, were created using a polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis strategy. Primers corresponding to the HIP-1 sequence were designed with the indicated base change, corresponding to amino acids 397 and 398 in the DED (E397G: 5′-GCGGCCGACGACTGTGGAT-3′; F398G: 5′-CGGCCGACGACTGTGAAGGC-3′; F398Y: 5′-CGGCCGACGACTGTGAATAC-3′). HIP-1 was amplified using the mutagenesis primers and an antisense primer containing the HIP-1 SapI restriction enzyme site (5′-TCCGAAGAGCAGATAATTCCTC-3′). The mutagenesis destroyed anEcoRI site, facilitating screening of the clones. Positive clones were digested with SapI and EagI and ligated as a cassette into HIP-1. Each construct was sequenced across the mutation and ligation sites to verify sequence integrity. The expression of HIP-1, the DED, and the HIP-1 DED mutants was verified in transfected cells by Western blotting and immunofluorescence, as described previously (20Hackam A.S. Singaraja R.

An anti-HIP-1 polyclonal antisera, HIP1–526fp, was made against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encompassing amino acids 130–526 in HIP-1.

The cells were viewed with an Axioscope microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.), digitally captured with a CCD camera (Princeton Instrument Inc.), and the images were colorized and overlapped using the Eclipse software program (Empix Imaging Inc.). The percentage of cells with aggregates represents the percentage of all cells expressing huntingtin that contained aggregates. HIP-1 and EM48 co-localization was performed as described elsewhere (21Steininger T.L. Wainer B.H. Blakely R.D. Rye D.B. J. Comp.

Transfections were performed with the cells at 40% density using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's directions. Cell death was quantified in NT2 cells by co-transfection of the expression constructs with a plasmid containing the lacZ gene at a 4:1 ratio, and the cells were stained for β-galactosidase activity at 24 h post-transfection using standard procedures. An apoptotic morphology was scored as blue-staining cells that were rounded up, blebbed, and condensed, which were clearly distinguished from viable cells, which were flat and had neurite-like extensions. For inhibitor studies, the caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO, conjugated to a cellular internalization peptide (Calbiochem) was reconstituted in Me2SO and added to NT2 cells at a final concentration of 50 μm, at 5 h post-transfection for 19 h, in the presence of serum. HIP-1 and vector-transfected cells treated with Me2SO alone were used to control for the effect of the carrier. Statistical data analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls postcomparison tests. HEK 293 cell lines were created that stably expressed truncated huntingtin (1955 base pairs, 548 amino acids) containing 15 and 128 polyglutamine repeats (constructs described in Ref. 3Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B.

For toxicity measurements, cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells into 96-well plates and transfected with 0.1 μg of HIP-1 or lacZ DNA using a standard calcium phosphate protocol. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay at 24 h post-transfection by incubating the cells for 2 h in WST-1 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), as described (20Hackam A.S. Singaraja R.

Statistical data analyses were performed as above, using one-way analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls postcomparison tests. For caspase 3 assays, HEK 293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate and harvested 24 h later. The assay was performed using the ApoAlert Caspase-3 Assay Protocol (CLONTECH), and total protein concentrations were measured using a standard Lowry procedure. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, samples were measured using the Fluoroskan Ascent fluorometer (Labsystems) at an excitation wavelength of 390 nm and an emission of 505 nm in a 96-well plate. Statistical analyses were performed as above, using one-way analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls postcomparison tests. To test for interaction of HIP-1 with caspase 8 and usurpin, HEK 293T, NT2, and HeLa cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes and transfected at 50% density with a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged caspase 8 (a gift from Dr. L. Ellerby, Buck Center for Research on Aging). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mmTris-Cl, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitors). The cell lysate was precleared with protein G or A beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h and then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with antibody (anti-hemagglutinin antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-usurpin antisera (25Rasper D.M.

Antibody-antigen complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein G or A beads for 1.5 h, and the complexes were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer and twice with wash buffer (10 Tris-Cl, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Protein loading buffer was added to the washed beads, heated at 70 °C for 5 min, and then electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and HIP-1 was detected by Western blotting using the polyclonal antiserum HIP1fp. Transfection of HIP-1 into human NT2 neuronal precursor cells (23Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 24Neelands T.R.

The morphological changes were clearly evident at 18–24 h following transfection. This cellular phenotype is suggestive of apoptosis and was also observed upon expression of the proapoptotic protease caspase 8 and when the cells were treated with the apoptotic reagent tamoxifen, but it was seen only minimally with transfection of the empty vector or with expression of control proteins β-galactosidase and pyruvate kinase (Fig. 1 a, left). Quantification of cell death, using LacZ co-transfection to identify transfected cells, revealed that expression of HIP-1 in NT2 cells resulted in significantly more death than vector control (p < 0.001, n = 10) (Fig. 1 b). HIP-1 was also transfected into a second cell line, HEK 293T cells, and viability was measured using the MTT assay. The MTT assay measures mitochondrial function (26Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G.

HIP-1 induced significant levels of cell death at 24 and 48 h post-transfection in 293T cells (p < 0.001, n = 5) (Fig. 1,c and d). The cell death induced by HIP-1 was unlikely due to protein overload, since overexpression of other huntingtin interacting proteins, HIP-2, 2A. S. Hackam, unpublished observations. HIP-3 3R. Singaraja, S. Hadano, C. Wellington, W. Balch, and M. Hayden, manuscript in preparation. , and HIP-12 (28Chopra V.S. Metzler M. Rasper D. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Singaraja R. Gan L. Fichter K.M. McCutcheon K. Drubin D. Nicholson D.W. Hayden M.R. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 1006-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), did not result in apoptosis by morphological assessment or MTT assay. Additionally, we have previously described that huntingtin overexpression is not directly toxic but increases the susceptibility to apoptotic stress in 293T cells (20Hackam A.S. Singaraja R. Wellington C.L. Metzler M. McCutcheon K. Zhang T. Kalchman M. Hayden M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The comparative toxicities of HIP-1 and huntingtin are shown in Fig. 1 d. HIP-1 is extremely toxic in 293T cells at 48 h post-transfection, and in fact no viable cells were detected. By contrast, full-length huntingtin with 128 repeats (10366-128) and a huntingtin fragment (771-128) were not toxic in 293T cells unless the transfected cells were first treated with a sublethal apoptotic stimulus. Sequence similarity between HIP-1, HIP-1 family members, and the yeast homologue Sla2p has suggested functions for HIP-1 involving the actin cytoskeleton. Although Sla2p is not known to have any cell death-inducing activity, the morphological changes resulting from HIP-1 expression suggest that HIP-1 activates an apoptotic pathway. Since the HIP-1 sequence in the predicted coiled-coil region differs substantially from Sla2p, we wished to determine whether this region contains additional domains that may form the basis for the toxicity of HIP-1. Mediators of apoptosis frequently have discrete domains that are necessary for their proapoptotic activity, including caspase recruitment domains, death domains, and DEDs. Searches for proteins homologous to HIP-1 and subsequent sequence alignments using the GCG software program revealed a novel domain not previously identified in HIP-1 (Fig. 2). The HIP-1 protein sequence, from residue 376 to 457, has homology to DEDs found in caspase 10, caspase 8, FADD, usurpin (c-FLIP), and several viral DED-containing proteins (25Rasper D.M.

DEDs act as protein interaction modules that link adapter proteins such as FADD to DED-containing caspases such as caspase 8, into a complex with activated membrane-bound receptors for Fas or tumor necrosis factor, called the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (30Boldin M.P.

The formation of the DISC protein complex is a crucial step in the initiation and signaling of apoptosis induced by multiple agents (35Li H. Yuan J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 36Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Pairwise comparisons of the full-length protein sequences indicated that HIP-1 contains only one DED, in contrast to the proapoptotic caspase proteins, which have two DEDs (Fig. 2). Conserved residues are located throughout the HIP-1 DED. However, the average percentage of similarity between HIP-1 and other DED-containing proteins is 33%, which, although significant, is lower than the average similarity among caspase DEDs (41.7%). The HIP-1 DED is predicted to have a structure composed of six α-helices, based on its similarity to the protein FADD (Fig. 2). Thus, the presence of a DED in a huntingtin interacting protein suggests a direct link between huntingtin, HIP-1, and the apoptotic pathway. Sequence analysis predicted a DED in HIP-1. However, to establish its functionality, we determined whether the HIP-1 DED is active and involved in HIP-1-mediated toxicity. To do this, a construct was created that encodes for just the HIP-1 DED, epitope-tagged for detection. Transfection of the DED construct into NT2 cells resulted in morphological changes similar to the HIP-1 transfections, including cell rounding, blebbing, and retraction of cytoplasmic extensions (data not shown). Additionally, the level of toxicity due to DED expression alone was indistinguishable from full-length HIP-1 in NT2 cells (Fig. 3 a), indicating that the DED is responsible for HIP-1 toxicity. Alignment of the DED sequences in Fig. 2 demonstrates that a highly conserved phenylalanine residue present within the DEDs of the proteins (37Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 940-945Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar) is also present in HIP-1. The phenylalanine in HIP-1, at position 398, is in an analogous location to the phenylalanine in FADD, approximately 20 residues into the domain, within the putative α2-helix (arrow in Fig. 2). Furthermore, this is the only phenylalanine present within the HIP-1 DED (Fig. 2). Secondary structure modeling of the DED in FADD predicted that the phenylalanine is in the second of six antiparallel α-helices and contributes to a hydrophobic region that contacts its protein partner caspase 8, leading to apoptosis induction (37Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 940-945Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the study by Eberstadt et al. (37Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 940-945Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar), mutation of the FADD hydrophobic phenylalanine to nonhydrophobic residues reduced FADD-mediated toxicity, whereas substitution to a different hydrophobic residue did not change toxicity. Thus, a particular secondary structure of the DED appears to be important to FADD DED activity. We hypothesized that because of the high degree of conservation in this region of the DEDs, the function of the HIP-1 DED may also be depen"

We have developed a method to extract and high pressure liquid chromatography-fractionate the antibacterial factors present in the small intestine of a single mouse. By mass spectrometry and sequence analyses of fractions exhibiting antimicrobial activity, we identified and characterized the defensin region in germ-free mice as well as in colonized mice. Defensins made up around 15% of the total antibacterial activity both in germ-free and colonized mice. The intestine of germ-free mice exhibited the same set of mature enteric defensins (defensins 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) as mice colonized by a normal microflora. Mature defensins are generated through processing of larger precursors by enzymatic removal of a signal peptide and a propiece. We found that all prodefensins were cleaved at a Ser/Ala-Leu bond, giving 34-residue propiece peptides and only trace amounts of the predicted 39-residue peptide. This first step must be followed by the removal of a residual peptide to render the mature defensins, indicating that the processing is more complex than previously anticipated. The same propieces were found in both germ-free and colonized mice, suggesting that the same processing operates independent of bacterial presence in the intestine.

During the last two decades, host gene-mediated antimicrobial peptides have been shown to be among the most potent effector molecules of innate immunity (1Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 2Andreu D. Rivas L. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 415-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The mammalian defensins constitute a family of cationic antimicrobial peptides characterized by three intramolecular disulphide bonds (3Selsted M.E. Harwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4003-4007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The defensins are grouped into α- and β-defensins based on different interlinking of the cysteines. The α-defensins are predominantly expressed in granula of neutrophils and intestinal Paneth cells, whereas the β-defensins have been found mainly in epithelial cells (4Bevins C.L. Martin-Porter E. Ganz T. Gut. 1999; 45: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Defensins are synthesized as preproform peptides with 90–100 amino acid residues. The endoplasmic reticulum-targeting signal prepeptide is cleaved off, and the remaining propeptide is subject to further processing, rendering an anionic propiece of unknown function and the cationic mature defensin (5Ganz T. Boman H.G. March J. Goode J.A. Antimicrobial Peptides. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1994: 62-76Google Scholar). Unlike humans, mice lack granular defensins in their neutrophils (6Eisenhauer P.B. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3446-3447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, cloning and sequencing predicted the mouse small intestine to produce at least 17 different defensins (cryptdins) (4Bevins C.L. Martin-Porter E. Ganz T. Gut. 1999; 45: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Ouellette A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G257-G261PubMed Google Scholar), but thus far, only 6 of these putative peptides have been isolated and studied in vitro(8Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J.

The small intestine has a much lower number of bacteria, most likely due to Paneth cell production of enteric defensins, lysozyme and phospholipase A2 (8Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 11Elsbach P. Prog. Surg. 1997; 24: 17-22Crossref Google Scholar, 12Qu X.D. Lloyd K.C. Walsh J.H.

Here we developed a procedure for extraction and high pressure liquid chromatography separation of the antibacterial factors present in the small intestine of a single mouse. We show that the enteric defensins represent but one set of antimicrobial components present in mice small intestine. By comparing germ-free mice to mice with a normal microflora, we demonstrate that microbes are not necessary for the processing and production of enteric defensins. Furthermore, the differences in active defensins in the small intestine between colonized and germ-free mice are smaller than the differences between individual animals.DISCUSSIONTo increase the understanding of the biological functions of antimicrobial peptides (peptide antibiotics), in vivoexperiments are needed. Analysis of animals reared for many generations under sterile conditions (the germ-free mice) may provide the default levels and settings of antimicrobial components in the absence of microbes (18Falk P.G. Hooper L. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Microbiol. Molecul. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1157-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In earlier biochemical studies of enteric mice defensins, pooled material and several enrichment steps were been used before the final separation. Compared with those studies, our approach allows an estimation of the overall number of components present in the small intestine of a single mouse and the variation between individuals. The mice were not subjected to any stimulus, and thus the peptides produced represent a steady-state level. It was unexpected that the enteric defensins should account for only 15% of the total activity. However, it must be stressed that we have used one antibacterial assay that is not necessarily optimal for all antimicrobial substances.The main conclusion of our work is that the presence or absence of an intestinal microflora does not have a major influence on the production of defensins. In the small intestine of GF mice, we detected enteric defensins DEF 1, DEF 2, DEF 3, and DEF 6 and low levels of DEF 4. The colonized conventional mice also exhibited the same set of defensins. This is in agreement with earlier findings with normal mice (8Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 10Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Canogauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5040-5047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We did not detect mature DEF 5 in any of the mice analyzed, although the purification of this peptide has been reported previously (10Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Canogauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5040-5047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low levels of defensin 5 mRNA were found in the mice we studied,2 and we could detect prodefensin 5 (Table II). The production of DEF 2 and DEF 3 was found to be linked to the induction of chloride secretion and crypt flushing, activities that DEF 4 and DEF 5 lack (19Lencer W.I., G. Cheung G. Strohmeier G.R. Currie M.G. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 8585-8589Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, proDEF 5 may be differentially regulated by a proteolytic processing, due to tentative function(s) other than microbicidal.The conventional mice differed from GF mice in the production of CRS4C-4. To our knowledge, this is the first time mature CRS4C-4 peptide has been isolated. The peptide has an unusual composition with 9 cysteine residues, and its biological function is not yet known. No CRS4C mRNA was detected in newborn mice; however, newborn mice did have high levels of defensin 6 mRNA (17Huttner K.M. Ouellette A.J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These findings are similar to our results with GF mice, showing high levels of the propiece for DEF 6, but no detectable CRS4C-4.The mouse enteric defensins are processed from 73-residue precursors. Our data show that there are at least two processing sites involved. We suggest that a major pathway includes a primary cut giving a 34-residue propiece, followed by a second cut trimming away the 4–7 additional residues to render the mature defensin (Fig. 3 A). This suggestion is based on the following arguments. i) In our HPLC fractions, the 34-residue propiece is the absolutely dominating compound. Only trace amounts of the 39-residue peptide were found. ii) This processing is similar to what has been found for other antimicrobial peptides like human α-defensins (20Porter E.M. Poles M.A. Lee J.S. Naitoh J. Bevins C.L. Ganz T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Valore E.V. Ganz T.

Andreu D. Li Z.-q. Merrifield R.B. Schlenstedt G. Zimmerman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5852-5860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). iii) The 34-residue peptide cleavage sites are highly conserved. Considering all 17 prodefensins, cleavage occurs between a Ser and a Leu in 15 of 17 possible cleavage sites, suggesting a serine-specific mechanism. A processing of the propiece from residue 39 and backwards does not make any biological sense because the mature defensin is already achieved. iv) A 34-residue propart is the sole alternative in case of the non-defensin-like peptide CRS4C-4 (Fig. 3 B).We found no qualitative difference between GF and conventional mice with respect to processing of defensins. The peptide pattern was not restricted to the mouse strain NMRI/KI used here because the same peptides were found in C3H/HeJ mice (data not shown). In vitro matrilysin from mouse Paneth cell could cleave prodefensin (24Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. López-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar), and it could be responsible for the 39-residue peptide found in conventional mice. However, matrilysin could not be detected in GF mice (25López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Hultgren S.J. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), indicating that other enzymes can be involved in the processing. The first cleavage after residue 34 may be due to an enzyme with a matrilysin-like specificity because the two processing sites after residues 34 and 39 are quite similar (Fig. 3 A).The fact that mice produce defensins independently of microbes (Figs. 1and 2) whereas bacteria apparently up-regulate matrilysin (25López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Hultgren S.J. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) suggests that matrilysin could speed up the maturation process during bacterial challenge. The defensins from our GF mice must have been synthesized independently of any microbial colonization. It is possible that other factors such as food can stimulate the production and release of antimicrobial factors, either directly or by a hormonal feeding signal. In agreement with our findings, mRNA of defensin 1–3 has been found in GF mice and in the small intestine of the developing mouse (26Ouellette A.J. Greco R.M. James M. Frederick D. Naftilan J. Fallon J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the dramatic increase in Paneth cell number per crypt, which occurs early after birth, did not require stimulation from the microflora (14Bry L. Falk P. Huttner K. Ouellette A. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10335-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, in isolated crypts, degranulation of the Paneth cells could be induced both by different bacteria and by several bacterial surface products (27Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nature Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). It is possible that on the crypt level, the release of enteric defensins is induced by bacteria and bacterial components, whereas on the organism level, neural or hormonal signaling could add additional levels of regulation of defensin-producing Paneth cells.In conclusion, the processing of mouse defensins includes as a first step cleavage of a Ser-Leu bond, giving a 34-residue propiece peptide. To obtain mature defensins, further processing is needed to remove 4–7 residues. The processing as such may control the level of mature peptides. This, in turn, could depend on functions other than microbicidal, as suggested for defensins 2 and 3 (19Lencer W.I., G. Cheung G. Strohmeier G.R. Currie M.G. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 8585-8589Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The overall work shows that in vitro data on the production and functions of gene-encoded peptide antibiotics need to be supported or confirmed byin vivo data as obtained here by comparing conventional and germ-free mice. All multicellular organisms including plants can actively protect themselves against microbes. During the last two decades, host gene-mediated antimicrobial peptides have been shown to be among the most potent effector molecules of innate immunity (1Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 2Andreu D. Rivas L. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 415-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The mammalian defensins constitute a family of cationic antimicrobial peptides characterized by three intramolecular disulphide bonds (3Selsted M.E. Harwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4003-4007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The defensins are grouped into α- and β-defensins based on different interlinking of the cysteines. The α-defensins are predominantly expressed in granula of neutrophils and intestinal Paneth cells, whereas the β-defensins have been found mainly in epithelial cells (4Bevins C.L. Martin-Porter E. Ganz T. Gut. 1999; 45: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Defensins are synthesized as preproform peptides with 90–100 amino acid residues. The endoplasmic reticulum-targeting signal prepeptide is cleaved off, and the remaining propeptide is subject to further processing, rendering an anionic propiece of unknown function and the cationic mature defensin (5Ganz T. Boman H.G. March J. Goode J.A. Antimicrobial Peptides. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1994: 62-76Google Scholar). Unlike humans, mice lack granular defensins in their neutrophils (6Eisenhauer P.B. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3446-3447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, cloning and sequencing predicted the mouse small intestine to produce at least 17 different defensins (cryptdins) (4Bevins C.L. Martin-Porter E. Ganz T. Gut. 1999; 45: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Ouellette A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G257-G261PubMed Google Scholar), but thus far, only 6 of these putative peptides have been isolated and studied in vitro(8Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 9Huttner K.M. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J.

Immun. 1994; 62: 5040-5047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All mammals have a normal microflora in the gastrointestinal tract that is most numerous in the colon. The small intestine has a much lower number of bacteria, most likely due to Paneth cell production of enteric defensins, lysozyme and phospholipase A2 (8Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 11Elsbach P. Prog. Surg. 1997; 24: 17-22Crossref Google Scholar, 12Qu X.D. Lloyd K.C. Walsh J.H.

Acta. 1967; 139: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here we developed a procedure for extraction and high pressure liquid chromatography separation of the antibacterial factors present in the small intestine of a single mouse. We show that the enteric defensins represent but one set of antimicrobial components present in mice small intestine. By comparing germ-free mice to mice with a normal microflora, we demonstrate that microbes are not necessary for the processing and production of enteric defensins. Furthermore, the differences in active defensins in the small intestine between colonized and germ-free mice are smaller than the differences between individual animals. DISCUSSIONTo increase the understanding of the biological functions of antimicrobial peptides (peptide antibiotics), in vivoexperiments are needed. Analysis of animals reared for many generations under sterile conditions (the germ-free mice) may provide the default levels and settings of antimicrobial components in the absence of microbes (18Falk P.G. Hooper L. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Microbiol. Molecul. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1157-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In earlier biochemical studies of enteric mice defensins, pooled material and several enrichment steps were been used before the final separation. Compared with those studies, our approach allows an estimation of the overall number of components present in the small intestine of a single mouse and the variation between individuals. The mice were not subjected to any stimulus, and thus the peptides produced represent a steady-state level. It was unexpected that the enteric defensins should account for only 15% of the total activity. However, it must be stressed that we have used one antibacterial assay that is not necessarily optimal for all antimicrobial substances.The main conclusion of our work is that the presence or absence of an intestinal microflora does not have a major influence on the production of defensins. In the small intestine of GF mice, we detected enteric defensins DEF 1, DEF 2, DEF 3, and DEF 6 and low levels of DEF 4. The colonized conventional mice also exhibited the same set of defensins. This is in agreement with earlier findings with normal mice (8Selsted M.E. Miller S.I. Henschen A.H. Ouellette A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 10Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Canogauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5040-5047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We did not detect mature DEF 5 in any of the mice analyzed, although the purification of this peptide has been reported previously (10Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M. Nosek M.T. Canogauci D.F. Huttner K.M. Buick R.N. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5040-5047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low levels of defensin 5 mRNA were found in the mice we studied,2 and we could detect prodefensin 5 (Table II). The production of DEF 2 and DEF 3 was found to be linked to the induction of chloride secretion and crypt flushing, activities that DEF 4 and DEF 5 lack (19Lencer W.I., G. Cheung G. Strohmeier G.R. Currie M.G. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 8585-8589Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, proDEF 5 may be differentially regulated by a proteolytic processing, due to tentative function(s) other than microbicidal.The conventional mice differed from GF mice in the production of CRS4C-4. To our knowledge, this is the first time mature CRS4C-4 peptide has been isolated. The peptide has an unusual composition with 9 cysteine residues, and its biological function is not yet known. No CRS4C mRNA was detected in newborn mice; however, newborn mice did have high levels of defensin 6 mRNA (17Huttner K.M. Ouellette A.J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These findings are similar to our results with GF mice, showing high levels of the propiece for DEF 6, but no detectable CRS4C-4.The mouse enteric defensins are processed from 73-residue precursors. Our data show that there are at least two processing sites involved. We suggest that a major pathway includes a primary cut giving a 34-residue propiece, followed by a second cut trimming away the 4–7 additional residues to render the mature defensin (Fig. 3 A). This suggestion is based on the following arguments. i) In our HPLC fractions, the 34-residue propiece is the absolutely dominating compound. Only trace amounts of the 39-residue peptide were found. ii) This processing is similar to what has been found for other antimicrobial peptides like human α-defensins (20Porter E.M. Poles M.A. Lee J.S. Naitoh J. Bevins C.L. Ganz T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Valore E.V. Ganz T. Blood. 1992; 79: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Harwig S.S.L. Park A.S.K. Lehrer R.I. Blood. 1992; 79: 1532-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cecropins (23Boman H.G. Boman A.I. Andreu D. Li Z.-q. Merrifield R.B. Schlenstedt G. Zimmerman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5852-5860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). iii) The 34-residue peptide cleavage sites are highly conserved. Considering all 17 prodefensins, cleavage occurs between a Ser and a Leu in 15 of 17 possible cleavage sites, suggesting a serine-specific mechanism. A processing of the propiece from residue 39 and backwards does not make any biological sense because the mature defensin is already achieved. iv) A 34-residue propart is the sole alternative in case of the non-defensin-like peptide CRS4C-4 (Fig. 3 B).We found no qualitative difference between GF and conventional mice with respect to processing of defensins. The peptide pattern was not restricted to the mouse strain NMRI/KI used here because the same peptides were found in C3H/HeJ mice (data not shown). In vitro matrilysin from mouse Paneth cell could cleave prodefensin (24Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. López-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar), and it could be responsible for the 39-residue peptide found in conventional mice. However, matrilysin could not be detected in GF mice (25López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Hultgren S.J. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), indicating that other enzymes can be involved in the processing. The first cleavage after residue 34 may be due to an enzyme with a matrilysin-like specificity because the two processing sites after residues 34 and 39 are quite similar (Fig. 3 A).The fact that mice produce defensins independently of microbes (Figs. 1and 2) whereas bacteria apparently up-regulate matrilysin (25López-Boado Y.S. Wilson C.L. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Hultgren S.J. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) suggests that matrilysin could speed up the maturation process during bacterial challenge. The defensins from our GF mice must have been synthesized independently of any microbial colonization. It is possible that other factors such as food can stimulate the production and release of antimicrobial factors, either directly or by a hormonal feeding signal. In agreement with our findings, mRNA of defensin 1–3 has been found in GF mice and in the small intestine of the developing mouse (26Ouellette A.J. Greco R.M. James M. Frederick D. Naftilan J. Fallon J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the dramatic increase in Paneth cell number per crypt, which occurs early after birth, did not require stimulation from the microflora (14Bry L. Falk P. Huttner K. Ouellette A. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10335-10339Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, in isolated crypts, degranulation of the Paneth cells could be induced both by different bacteria and by several bacterial surface products (27Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C.

All TIMP family members inhibit the activity of the MMPs that regulate the composition of basement membranes and extracellular matrix. Thus, TIMPs play essential roles in regulating matrix composition, cell growth, invasion, and migration. Recently, several additional biochemical and physiological functions have been attributed to certain TIMP family members, including regulation of proliferation, pro-MMP-2 activation, inhibition of angiogenesis, transformation, and apoptosis (5Gomes D.

Cancer. 1998; 75: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We recently characterized the roles of TIMP-1, -2, and -3 on vascular smooth muscle cells growth and proliferation in vitro and in vivo using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer (19Baker A.H. Zaltsman A.B. George S.J. Newby A.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 20George S. Lloyd C. Angelini G. Newby A. Baker A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We discovered that overexpression of TIMP-3, but not TIMP-1 or -2, promoted apoptotic death of smooth muscle cells, which contributed to reduced neointima formation in vitro and in vivo. The fact that TIMP-3 could prevent neointima formation was attributed to its activity as a classical MMP inhibitor and the promotion of apoptosis (20George S. Lloyd C. Angelini G. Newby A. Baker A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). TIMP-3 has also been reported to promote apoptosis in a number of cancer cell lines (21Ahonen M. Baker A. Kahari V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2310-2315PubMed Google Scholar, 22Baker A. George S. Zaltsman A. Murphy G. Newby A. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 23Smith M. Kung H. Durum S. Colburn N. Sun Y. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For example, Smith et al. (23Smith M. Kung H. Durum S. Colburn N. Sun Y. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) suggested that TIMP-3 promotes apoptosis of colon carcinoma cells by blocking proteolytic shedding of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) receptors.TIMP-3 has also been implicated in disease progression. Imbalances between TIMPs and metalloproteinases have been observed in numerous disease processes, including atherogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, and tumor metastasis (24Galis Z.S. Muszynski M. Sukhova G.K. Simonmorrissey E. Unemori E.N. Lark M.W. Amento E. Libby P. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 25Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. De Carlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar). This is largely due to altered matrix remodeling that occurs in these pathologies. However, the additional functions of TIMPs such as promotion of cell growth may contribute to disease progression. With reference to TIMP-3, mutations in the TIMP-3 gene are associated with Sorsby's fundus dystrophy (SFD), a degenerative disease affecting the retinal epithelial cells (26Anand-Apte B. Bao L. Smith R. Iwata K. Olsen B. Zetter B. Apte S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Weber B. Vogt G. Pruett R. Stohr H. Felbor U. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all known mutations ofTIMP-3 associated with SFD, which cause the loss or gain of a cysteine residue, retain their ability to inhibit metalloproteinases and bind the extracellular matrix. Rather, it is thought that these mutations cause mutant TIMP-3 to accumulate in the retina and promote disease. Whether TIMP-3 is directly responsible for increased apoptosis associated with SFD is unclear.Therefore, to evaluate the domain(s) of TIMP-3 required for induction of apoptosis and fully define the need for functional MMP-inhibitory activity in this induction, we generated a series of TIMP-3 mutant proteins and adenoviral constructs. Our results demonstrate that the N terminus of TIMP-3 harbors the death domain and functional metalloproteinase-inhibitory activity is a requirement for induction of apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHuman kidney embryonic 293 cells were purchased from Microbix (Toronto, Canada) and HeLa cells from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK). All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (Poole, UK) and were of the highest grade available. Culture media and additives were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, Scotland). Rabbit polyclonal anti-TIMP-3 antibody was purchased from Chemicon International (Harrow, UK).MethodsCell Culture293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% v/v fetal calf serum. Rat smooth muscle cells were prepared from the thoracic aortas as described previously (28Bennett M. Angelin S. McEwan J. Jagoe R. Newby A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 820-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Rat SMC and HeLa were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v) 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide.Generation and Purification of Recombinant TIMP-3 ProteinsRecombinant human TIMP-3 was expressed from myeloma cells and purified as described previously (29Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14313-14318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The N-terminal three loops of TIMP-3 (N-TIMP-3) was constructed in a prokaryotic expression system as follows: the residues encoding N-terminal TIMP-3 (residues 1–121) were amplified by PCR using the primer (5′-GGC ATA TGT GCA CAT GCT CGC CCA GCC ACC CCC AG-3′), which encodes anNdeI site (underlined) prior to Cys1of the TIMP-3 cDNA sequence and was used in a PCR reaction with the reverse primer, to introduce a stop codon following the coding sequences for Asn121 and a uniqueEcoRI site (underlined) included (5′-GGA ATT CAG TTA CAA CCC AGG TGA TAC CGA TAG TT-3′). The PCR fragment was ligated into EcoRV-cleaved Bluescript, and a positive clone for each was identified by restriction analysis. The Δ122–188 TIMP-3 vector was generated by ligating theNdeI to EcoRI fragment into pRSET A previously cleaved with these restriction enzymes. The resulting expression vector was used to transform BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli, and the resulting transformants were grown in 2xYT medium supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol to an A600of 0.6 prior to induction of expression with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Inclusion bodies were prepared using standard methods, and the protein was solubilized, refolded, and purified from inclusion bodies using the method described for N-TIMP-2 (30Butler G.S. Apte S.S. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10846-10851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Construction of a pET 23d expression vector for TIMP-2/TIMP-3, expression, and refolding of the inhibitor was as follows: a cDNA for TIMP-2/TIMP-3 was constructed by overlap extension mutagenesis using PCR. Part of the N-terminal TIMP-2 cDNA was amplified using a coding primer upstream of the BamHI site in TIMP-2 (5′-GTG ATC AGG GCC AAA GCG GTC AGT G-3′) and a reverse mutagenic primer encoding the junction between N-terminal TIMP-2 and C-terminal TIMP-3 (5′-GAT CTT GCA CTC GCA GCC CAT CTG GTA CCT GTG GTT CAG G-3′) using the pET 23d TIMP-2 cDNA as the template. The cDNA encoding the C-terminal domain of TIMP-3 was amplified by PCR using a coding mutagenic primer (5′-GGC TGC GAG TGC AAG ATC AAG TCC TGC TAC TAC CTG CCT TG-3′) and a reverse primer complementary to C-terminalTIMP-3, which introduced a 3′-EcoRI (underlined) site (5′-GGA ATT CAG GGG TCT GTG GCA TTG ATG ATG CTT TTA TCC GG-3′) and the TIMP-3 cDNA in pEE12 as the template. The two PCR fragments were isolated from a 1% agarose gel and overlap-extended by PCR using the coding primer upstream of the BamHI site in TIMP-2 and the reverse primer complementary to the C-terminal TIMP-3 sequence. The resulting PCR product was cleaved with BamHI andEcoRI and ligated into the expression vector for N-terminalTIMP-2 in pET23d. The expression vector was used to transform BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli, and the resulting transformants were grown as described above. Inclusion bodies were prepared using standard methods, and TIMP-2/TIMP-3 was refolded using the method established for N-TIMP-2 (30Butler G.S. Apte S.S. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10846-10851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The chimeric inhibitor was purified using SP-Sepharose chromatography. The inhibition constants of N-TIMP-3 and TIMP-2/TIMP-3 toward MMP-2 were determined using the kinetic procedure described elsewhere (31Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar).Adenoviral ConstructsThe adenovirus RAd66 (a gift from G. W. G. Wilkinson, Cardiff, UK) contains the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter and polyadenylation signal but no transgene and acts as a “virus-only” control. The generation of RAd:wtTIMP-3 has been described in detail previously (19Baker A.H. Zaltsman A.B. George S.J. Newby A.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar).A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate the TIMP-3 Cys1 → Ser (TIMP-3Cys1-Ser) cDNA mutant. Oligonucleotide primers were designed spanning the N terminus of mature TIMP-3incorporating the base substitution glycine to cysteine at position 51 (underlined). Primers were as follows: sense, 5′-C GGC GCC GAG GCG TCC ACA TGC TCG CCC AG; antisense, CT GGG CGA GCA TGT GGA CGC CTC GGC GCC C-3′. Mutated TIMP-3 was then amplified by PCR using primers spanning the initiation and termination codons based on the published sequences (sense, 5′-GCTAG CTA ATG ACC CTT GGC TCG GGC TCA-3′; antisense, 5′-GCTAG CTA TCA GGG GTC TGT GGC ATT GAT G-3′). AnNheI restriction site (underlined) and clamp was synthesized at the 5′-ends of each primer to create uniqueNheI cloning sites. 0.1 ng ofTIMP-3Cys1-Ser cDNA template was amplified using a Thermocycler (PerkinElmer, Emeryville, CA). PCR products were purified using Wizard PCR preps (Promega, Southampton, UK) and fragments cloned into the NheI site of pAL119 (32Baker A.H. Wilkinson G.W.G. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. Newby A.C. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to create pAL119:TIMP-3Cys1-Ser. The entire insert was sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation and ensure that no PCR-induced mutations were present. Sequencing primers were located in the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (5′-CGC CAT CCA CGC TGT TTT GA-3′) and the polyadenylation region (5′-TTG AGT AGG ATT ACA GAG TA-3′).cDNA representing the N-terminal domain (residues 1–121) ofTIMP-3 was generated using the antisense primer 5′-CCG GCT AGC CTA GTT ACA ACC CAG GTG ATA CCG-3′ (clamp andNheI restriction site underlined) and cloned into the NheI site of pAL119 (32Baker A.H. Wilkinson G.W.G. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. Newby A.C. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of pAL119:TIMP-3Cys1-Ser or pAL119:NtTIMP3 with the adenovirus genome vector pJM17 into 293 cells resulted in formation of recombinant adenovirus carrying the TIMP-3Cys1-Ser or N-terminalTIMP-3 transgenes. Recombinant adenovirus was purified through two rounds of plaque purification then propagated, purified, and titered using standard methods (33Nicklin S. Baker A. Baker A. Vascular Disease: Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy Protocols. 1st Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 271-284Google Scholar). Lack of replication competence was demonstrated by infection of non-permissive cell lines.Adenovirus InfectionRat SMC and HeLa cells were cultured in six-well plates or on sterile coverslips until 80% confluent. An accurate cell number was assessed preinfection by trypsinization of three wells and counting using a Neubauer hemocytometer. Remaining wells were infected at 300 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell (rat SMC) and 100 pfu/cell (HeLa) in 1 ml of fresh complete media for 18 h. Media were then replaced with 2 ml of fresh complete media and left for the required length of time prior to analysis.Western Blot Analysis for TIMP-3To allow analysis of TIMP-3 expression, cells were non-enzymatically removed from the extracellular matrix by washing in ice-cold 1× citric saline (132 mm KCl, 17 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.6). Conditioned matrices were washed in PBS and extracted in 1 × non-reducing sample buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.0012% bromphenol blue). Protein extracts were electrophoresed through 12% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-RAd). Membranes were blocked in 5% fat-free milk and incubated with 1:5000 dilution antibody in 5% fetal bovine serum/PBS for 3 h. Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Reverse ZymographyTIMP-3 metalloproteinase-inhibitory activity in extracellular matrix extracts was evaluated by reversed zymography essentially as described (34Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Slocombe P.M. Docherty A.J.P. Reynold J.J. Murphy G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 35Fabunmi R.P. Baker A.H. Murray E.J. Booth R.F.G. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.8 mg/ml gelatin and 8% baby hamster kidney cell-conditioned media as a source of activated metalloproteinase. Following electrophoresis, SDS was removed by washing in 2.5% Triton X-100 and gels were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h in zymogram incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Ca2Cl, and 0.05% Brij35). Gels were then stained in 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. TIMP activity was visualized as dark zones of gelatinase inhibition against a pale partially digested background.Cell Death AssayCell death in response to purified recombinant TIMP-3 proteins was assessed using the 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt (WST-1) assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Lewes, UK). Briefly, cells were cultured in 96-well plates until 80% confluent and incubated with increasing nanomolar concentrations of purified recombinant TIMP-3 proteins. After 72 h, cells were incubated at 37 °C with 200 μl of WST-1 reagent, and optical density was measured using a Multiscan spectrophotometer (Labsystems) at 450 nm.In Situ End Labeling of DNARat SMC were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in ice-cold methanol 72 h after addition of virus. After air drying, cells were washed twice in 1× TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and incubated in labeling mix (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 mm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, 0.01 mm biotin-dUTP, and 8 units/ml DNA polymerase I; Klenow) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed in 1× TE, and endogenous peroxidase activity reduced by incubation in 2% H2O2 for 5 min. After further washing, biotin was labeled with Extravidin peroxidase conjugate (1:200). Incubation with diaminobenzidine and subsequent counterstaining with hematoxylin was to distinguish positive apoptotic nuclei containing nicked DNA from non-apoptotic nuclei.Flow Cytometric Analysis of DNA ContentAdherent cells were trypsinized and pooled with any non-adherent cells, centrifuged, and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. Cells were fixed by adding 2 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol while vortexing and stored at 4 °C prior to analysis. For staining, cells were washed in PBS and stained in 1 ml of Krishans reagent (0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.01 mg/ml ribonuclease A, 0.3% Nonidet P-40). Cells were analyzed on a FACScan (fitted with Cellquest software, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and data were analyzed using WinMDI software (Joseph Trotter, Scripps Institute).DISCUSSIONThe major biological role of TIMPs identified so far is to inhibit the matrix metalloproteinases in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. In addition to this role, numerous studies have attributed additional functions to the TIMPs, including inhibition of tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (5Gomes D. Alonso D. Yoshiji H. UP T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stetler-Stevenson W. Bersch N. Golde D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Ohuchi E. Shinagawa J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Valenta P. Fassina G. Melchiori A. Masiello L. Cilli M. Onisto M. Santi W. Stetler-Stevenson G. Albini A. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 21Ahonen M. Baker A. Kahari V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2310-2315PubMed Google Scholar). For example, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 have cell growth-and erythroid-potentiating activities (14Stetler-Stevenson W. Bersch N. Golde D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 37Gasson J. Golde D. Kaufman S. Westbrook C. Hewick R. Kaufman R. Wong G. Temple P. Leary A. Brown E. Nature. 1985; 315: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Some of these functions may be at least partially dependent on metalloproteinases inhibition. For example, the inhibition of cell migration by the TIMPs is due to their metalloproteinase-inhibitory activities and is mimicked by synthetic MMP inhibitors (15Southgate K.M. Davies M. Booth R.F. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 20George S. Lloyd C. Angelini G. Newby A. Baker A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 38Bendeck M. Irvin C. Reidy M. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, the cell growth-promoting activity of TIMP-2 has been shown to be independent of metalloproteinase inhibition (16Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Ohuchi E. Shinagawa J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The erythroid-potentiating activity of TIMP-1 has also been shown to be independent of metalloproteinase inhibition (17Chesler L. Golde D. Bersch N. Johnson M. Blood. 1995; 86: 4506-4515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the multiple biological functions of the TIMPs are due to discrete structural features within the protein.Because the N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 is responsible for metalloproteinase inhibition, we investigated whether induction of apoptosis by TIMP-3 is dependent on an intact metalloproteinase-inhibitory domain. To this end, we constructed a mutant of TIMP-3 devoid of metalloproteinase-inhibitory activity by mutating the N-terminal cysteine residue to a serine. In wild type TIMP-3 the N-terminal cysteine residue is a key to the TIMP-3-inhibitory mechanism, because it bidentally co-ordinates the Zn2+ ion in the active site of metalloproteinases through the α-amino group and the peptide carbonyl group (41Gomis-Ruth F. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). An analogous TIMP-1 mutant completely lacks inhibitory activity toward MMP-1 and MMP-2, while maintaining structural integrity (36Caterina N. Windsor L. Yermovsky A. Bodden M. Taylor K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Engler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32141-32149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Likewise, we demonstrated that the Cys1 → Ser mutation of TIMP-3 results in loss of inhibitory activity toward MMP-2. Because the Cys1 → Ser mutation of TIMP-3 also resulted in loss of ability to induce apoptosis in both rat SMC and HeLa, the simplest conclusion is that inhibition of a metalloproteinase underlies the mechanism of TIMP-3-induced apoptosis. Consistent with our previous data (19Baker A.H. Zaltsman A.B. George S.J. Newby A.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), incubation with the synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor BB-94 failed to induce apoptosis. This is in agreement with our earlier observations where Ro-9790, a hydroxamate-based inhibitor with similar broad specificity for MMPs, had no effect on apoptosis of rat vascular smooth muscle cells (19Baker A.H. Zaltsman A.B. George S.J. Newby A.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This indicates that TIMP-3 is a more potent and selective inhibitor of the metalloproteinase involved in this apoptotic mechanism than these synthetic MMP inhibitors. This conclusion is in agreement with Smith and colleagues (23Smith M. Kung H. Durum S. Colburn N. Sun Y. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), who suggested that TIMP-3 promotes apoptosis of DLD carcinoma cells by blocking metalloproteinase-mediated shedding of TNF-α receptors, an effect that was not mimicked by BB-94. Our previous observations also show that overexpression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in vascular smooth muscle cells and melanoma cells potently inhibits invasion and MMP activity but does not result in increased apoptotic cell death (19Baker A.H. Zaltsman A.B. George S.J. Newby A.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 21Ahonen M. Baker A. Kahari V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2310-2315PubMed Google Scholar). Because TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are both effective MMP inhibitors, this suggests that the enzyme targeted by TIMP-3 is not an MMP but a related metalloproteinase that is preferentially inhibited by TIMP-3. For example, TIMP-3 has recently been shown to have the unique ability among TIMPs to inhibit members of the adamalysin (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family such as TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE (31Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar)). TACE is involved in the processing of TNF-α, a proapoptotic cytokine. It is possible that inhibition of TACE would lead to an accumulation of proapoptotic TNF-α on the cell surface and autocrine or juxtacrine death signaling. On the other hand, the ability of BB-94 to inhibit TACE (31Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) implies that this is not the only or even the principle mechanism of TIMP-3-induced apoptosis in our experiments. Other adamalysins are involved in the proteolytic shedding of numerous plasma membrane-anchored proteins, including growth factors, cytokines, receptors, and adhesion molecules. Inhibition of these shedding events by TIMP-3 could have profound effects on cell viability.In summary, this study has highlighted that functional metalloproteinase-inhibitory activity is associated with TIMP-3-induced death and that the N-terminal domain is responsible for the proapoptotic effect of TIMP-3. These observations have potential implications for TIMP-3-related pathologies, such as SFD, and the future development"
https://openalex.org/W2033604459,"We have investigated the mechanisms that target oxidized calmodulin for degradation by the proteasome. After methionine oxidation within calmodulin, rates of degradation by the 20 S proteasome are substantially enhanced. Mass spectrometry was used to identify the time course of the proteolytic fragments released from the proteasome. Oxidized calmodulin is initially degraded into large proteolytic fragments that are released from the proteasome and subsequently degraded into small peptides that vary in size from 6 to 12 amino acids. To investigate the molecular determinants that result in the selective degradation of oxidized calmodulin, we used circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy to assess oxidant-induced structural changes. There is a linear correlation between decreases in secondary structure and the rate of degradation. Calcium binding or the repair of oxidized calmodulin by methionine sulfoxide reductase induces comparable changes in α-helical content and rates of degradation. In contrast, alterations in the surface hydrophobicity of oxidized calmodulin do not alter the rate of degradation by the proteasome, indicating that changes in surface hydrophobicity do not necessarily lead to enhanced proteolytic susceptibility. These results suggest that decreases in secondary structure expose proteolytically sensitive sites in oxidized calmodulin that are cleaved by the proteasome in a nonprocessive manner. We have investigated the mechanisms that target oxidized calmodulin for degradation by the proteasome. After methionine oxidation within calmodulin, rates of degradation by the 20 S proteasome are substantially enhanced.

Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The proteasome represents approximately 1% of the total cellular protein and is present in the cytosol and nuclei of all mammalian cells in two major forms (i.e. the 20 S and 26 S proteasomes) (3Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome is a 700-kDa complex with a 10–20-Å-diameter opening into an internal cavity that provides a sequestered environment for proteolysis. The 26 S proteasome is a 2000-kDa complex containing two 19 S regulatory complexes bound to the 20 S multicatalytic core. The 26 S proteasome is responsible for the degradation of the majority of cellular proteins through an ATP-dependent and ubiquitin-mediated pathway (4Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 5Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 6Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 20 S proteasome core selectively degrades a range of different oxidized proteins in an ATP-independent manner and has been suggested to represent the primary mechanism in the rapid removal of oxidized proteins after oxidative stress (7Rivett A.J.

J. 1998; 335: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The signal for recognition and degradation of oxidized proteins by the 20 S proteasome is unknown but has been suggested to involve (i) exposure of hydrophobic surfaces after oxidative modification, (ii) recognition of molecular “markers” associated with the oxidative modification of specific amino acid side chains, and (iii) increases in the conformational flexibility of oxidized proteins (12Stadtman E.R.

To distinguish which signals are involved in targeting an oxidized protein for degradation by the 20 S proteasome, we have investigated the mechanisms involving the recognition and cleavage of oxidized calmodulin (CaM).1 CaM was chosen because of its key role in intracellular signaling and its functional sensitivity to conditions of oxidative stress (17Gao J. Yin D. Yao Y. Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9536-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Yin D. Kuczera K. Squier T.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After oxidative modification of multiple methionines to their corresponding sulfoxides, CaM is unable to activate a range of different target proteins involved in intracellular signaling (19Yao Y. Yin D. Kuczera K. Williams T.D. Schöneich Ch. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2767-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20Hühmer A.F.R. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Schöneich Ch. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CaM oxidation has the potential to result in large changes in cellular function as a result of changes in both calcium signaling and energy metabolism (21Squier T.C. Bigelow D.J. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 504-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this suggestion, CaM isolated from senescent brain contains multiple methionine sulfoxides that may be partially responsible for observed alterations in calcium signaling associated with a range of age-related diseases (17Gao J. Yin D. Yao Y. Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9536-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although intracellular enzymes exist that can reduce (i.e. repair) oxidized methionines and partially restore CaM function (22Sun H. Gao J. Ferrington D.A. Biesiada H. Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 102-112Google Scholar, 23Sharov V.S. Ferrington D.A. Squier T.C. Schöneich Ch. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it is essential that rapid turnover mechanisms exist to clear oxidatively modified CaM (CaMox) so as to maintain normal calcium signaling. In this respect normal CaM turnover is slow (t12 ≈ 18 h) in comparison with many transcription factors and other cellular regulatory molecules (24Jennison P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Ferrington D.A. Chen X. Krainev A.G. Michaelis E.K. Bigelow D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that the proteasome selectively degrades post-translationally modified CaM after deamidation of selected asparagines through a ubiquitin-independent cellular degradative mechanism (16Tarcsa E. Szymanska G. Lecker S. O'Conner C.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20295-20301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to determine whether the oxidation of methionines in CaM facilitates recognition and degradation by the 20 S proteasome and, if so, identify the molecular determinants that are responsible for the degradation of CaM after methionine oxidation. To identify the mechanisms underlying the degradation of oxidized CaM by the 20 S proteasome, in vitro conditions were used to selectively oxidize variable numbers of methionines in CaM (18Yin D. Kuczera K. Squier T.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Yao Y. Yin D. Kuczera K. Williams T.D. Schöneich Ch. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2767-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Under these conditions no amino acids other than methionine are oxidized, and the pattern of methionine oxidation is similar to that found in CaM isolated from senescent brain (17Gao J. Yin D. Yao Y. Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9536-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Yin D. Kuczera K. Squier T.C. Chem. Res.

We assessed the ability of the 20 S proteasome to degrade CaMox and identified recognition elements within CaMox that promote degradation. Our results demonstrate that the 20 S proteasome selectively degrades oxidized CaM in preference to native (unoxidized) CaM. Although neither hydrophobicity nor the presence of methionine sulfoxide are signals for the degradation of oxidized CaM, the rate of degradation correlates with the extent of secondary structural loss. Fluorescamine, fluorogenic peptides (Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AAF-AMC), Leu-Leu-Glu-β-naphthylamine (LLE-Na),N-t-Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (LSTR-AMC)), 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, β-naphthylamine, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate were obtained from Sigma. 1-Anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Polyclonal antibodies to the α and β subunits of the 20 S proteasome were purchased from Calbiochem. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG, and anti-mouse IgM were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.45 μm) for Western immunoblotting was from Millipore (Bedford, MA). All reagents for sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) were supplied by Bio-Rad. Benchmark prestained protein ladder molecular weight markers were from Life Technologies, Inc. The 20 S proteasome was purified from frozen livers of 4–6-month-old Fischer 344 rats essentially as described previously (26Conconi M. Szweda L.I. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Friguet B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The final purified proteasome was made to a concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 m KCl and stored at −70 °C. The purity of the proteasome, assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting, was similar to that previously reported (26Conconi M. Szweda L.I. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Friguet B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The maximal catalytic activity of the chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolase activities of the proteasome were, respectively, 0.3, 0.1, and 0.1 μmol/min/mg as assayed using the fluorogenic peptides Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AAF-AMC), Leu-Leu-Glu-β-naphthylamine (LLE-Na), and N-t-Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (LSTR-AMC). These catalytic activities were independent of the free calcium concentration (measured in reaction buffers containing 0.1 mm EGTA or after additions of either 100 and 500 μm calcium) and were comparable with values previously reported (27Rivet A.J. Savory P.J. Djaballah H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 331-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagents obtained from Pierce, using bovine serum albumin as the standard. A clone encoding the bovine liver isoform of methionine sulfoxide reductase, kindly provided by Drs. Brot and Moskovitz, was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase and purified as described previously using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column (28Moskovitz J. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2095-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A single isoform of CaM corresponding to the cDNA encoding vertebrate CaM provided by Professor Sam George (Duke University) was subcloned into the expression vector pALTER-Ex1, overexpressed in E. colistrain JM109, and purified essentially as described previously using phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B and weak anion exchange HPLC (20Hühmer A.F.R.

Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 542-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using a micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) using desalted CaM as the protein standard. The concentration of CaM standard was determined using the published molar extinction coefficient (ε277 nm = 3029m−1 cm−1) for calcium-saturated CaM (29Strasburg G.M. Hogan M. Birmachu W. Thomas D.D. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 542-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Klee C.B. Vanaman T.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Methionines in CaM were oxidized essentially as described previously (18Yin D. Kuczera K. Squier T.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) by incubating 60 μm CaM (1 mg/ml) in 50 mm HOMOPIPES (pH 5.0), 0.1m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 with 50 mmH2O2 at 25 °C for times ranging from 1 h to 24 h. Hydrogen peroxide concentration was determined by using the published extinction coefficient, ε 240 = 39.4 ± 0.2 m−1 cm−1 (31Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by dialyzing the sample overnight at 4 °C against multiple changes of distilled water (5 × 1 liter) buffered with ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.7). Rates of proteolysis using oxidized CaM as a substrate for the proteasome were determined using two different assays that involved 1) monitoring the disappearance of the integrated intensity of CaM bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and 2) measurement of the initial release of peptides generated by proteasome cleavage using fluorescamine, which forms a fluorescent adduct with the amino termini of peptides (15Friguet B. Szweda L.I. Stadtman E.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The rate of CaM degradation was linear with respect to proteasome concentration. Identical experimental conditions were used for both assays, which involved the incubation of CaM (600 nm) with the proteasome (5 nm) at 37 °C in 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mmKCl, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to 1) quantify the distribution of CaM oxiforms and determine the average methionine sulfoxide concentration for each sample and 2) identify masses of CaM peptides resulting from proteolytic cleavage, essentially as described previously (17Gao J. Yin D. Yao Y. Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9536-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Yin D. Kuczera K. Squier T.C. Chem. Res.

J. 1998; 74: 1115-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Identification of released peptides was assisted by the software GPMAW (Lighthouse Data, Aalokken 14, DK-5250; Odense SV, Denmark), which permitted a unique identification for approximately one-half of the released peptides. The calculated lengths of the remaining peptides were determined within one amino acid based on identification of two or three peptides whose theoretical masses were consistent with the experimentally measured masses of the released peptides. Tentative identification of these peptides relied on predicted cleavage motifs and permitted the calculation of the average size of the released peptide (33Nussbaum A.K. Dick T.P. Keilholz W. Schirle M. Stevanovic S. Dietz K. Heinemeyer W. Groll M. Wolf D.H. Huber R. Rammensee H.-G. Schild H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12504-12509Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured using a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter and a temperature-jacketed spectral cell with a path length of 1.0 cm. Spectra were recorded of CaM (0.6 nm) in 25 mmTris (pH 7.5), 0.1 m KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 at 1-nm intervals between 202 and 240 nm at 37 °C. The apparent helical content was determined by the method of ridge regression using the computer program Contin (34Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). The surface hydrophobicity of CaM was evaluated from the change in fluorescence spectra of ANS, which has previously been shown to accurately measure the surface hydrophobicity of a range of different model proteins (35Cardamone M. Puri N.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). After incubation of CaM (0.3 μm) for 30 min in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of ANS, the fluorescence emission was scanned from 450 to 600 nm (λex = 372 nm). The maximal fluorescence intensity and associated emission wavelength were determined after subtraction of the emission spectrum of ANS in the absence of protein. To address the selectivity and structural requirements of the proteasome in the degradation of oxidized CaM (CaMox), we first used ESI-MS to identify the extent of oxidation and distribution of oxidized CaM molecules that will be used as potential substrates. Before oxidative modification, CaM exhibits a single major ESI-MS peak corresponding to a mass of 16,707 ± 3 Da (Fig. 1 A), in close agreement with the theoretical average mass of vertebrate CaM expressed in E. coli (16, 705.4). In vitrooxidative modification of CaM (see “Experimental Procedures”) for increasing periods of time resulted in the appearance of additional peaks that differ in mass by 16 atomic mass units, which correspond to the nine possible CaM oxiforms. After correction for the charge-induced dissociation product generated in the mass spectrometer (32Gao J. Yin D.H. Yao Y. Sun H. Qin Z. Schöneich Ch. Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1115-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the area of each peak in the ESI-MS spectra provided an estimate of the relative abundance of each CaM species. In this manner the average number of oxygens incorporated into each CaM sample after in vitrooxidation was calculated (Fig. 1). An alternative resolution of CaM oxiforms was obtained by electrophoretic separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, taking advantage of differences in the electrophoretic mobilities of CaM with varying degrees of methionine oxidation (17Gao J. Yin D. Yao Y. Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9536-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Native (unoxidized) CaM migrates as a single band with the greatest electrophoretic mobility (Fig.2 A). After oxidative modification, multiple protein bands were resolved whose relative mobilities decreased after increasing amounts of oxidative modification. It should be noted that the large shifts in the relative mobility of CaM oxiforms are the result of methionine oxidation, as no other protein modifications are present under these experimental conditions. By comparison with the mobility of different CaM oxiforms separated and identified by weak anion exchange HPLC and ESI-MS, respectively, we have shown that each protein band on SDS-PAGE corresponds to CaM oxiforms having different integral numbers of methionine sulfoxide from 0 to 9 and that the relative mobility of the CaM oxiforms is inversely related to the number of oxidized methionines. Thus, the most extensively oxidized CaM, migrating with an apparent molecular mass near 18 kDa, corresponds to CaMox, containing an average of approximately 9 methionine sulfoxides in each CaM molecule. We have investigated whether native or oxidized CaM was a substrate for the proteasome using SDS-PAGE to resolve different oxiforms of CaM both before and after various times of exposure to proteasome. For the oxidized CaM sample before exposure to the proteasome, three major bands appear corresponding to native CaM and CaM containing as many as nine methionine sulfoxides; several intermediate oxiforms are present in very low abundance that have a reduced mobility (Fig. 2 B). In the absence of the proteasome, neither native nor oxidized CaM are degraded over the 6-h time course of the experiment. In contrast, the single band corresponding to extensively oxidized CaM is completely degraded with 3-h exposure to the proteasome. Under these conditions there is limited degradation of minor bands corresponding to CaM oxiforms, with an intermediate mobility over the subsequent 3 h. These results demonstrate that extensively oxidized CaM is preferentially degraded by the 20 S proteasome. To investigate the recognition signals and mechanism of degradation of extensively oxidized CaM (8.2 ± 0.6 methionine sulfoxides/CaM) by the 20 S proteasome, we used mass spectrometry to measure the masses of the peptides released from the proteasome. After exposure of CaMox to the proteasome, CaMox and released peptides were separated from the proteasome using a 100-kDa molecular weight cutoff filter. Their respective masses were identified by ESI-MS. After 1 h of degradation, approximately 10% of CaMox was degraded by the proteasome, and the released peptides were in large molar excess relative to the proteasome. Thus, the majority of these peptides represent products released from the proteasome before separation. At this time point, masses for 26 peptides were identified whose size distribution varied between 1188 and 4977 Da, which corresponds to peptide lengths between 10 and 39 amino acids. Of the resolved masses, 15 peptides were uniquely identified that varied in mass between 1187.6 and 3589.9 Da (TableI; Fig.3 A). From these data, it is apparent that cleavage occurs preferentially on the carboxyl-terminal side of Glu, Leu, Asp, Phe, Lys, and Ala (Fig.4). The preferential cleavage of these sites in CaMox agrees with earlier results using other protein substrates, suggesting that specific amino acid side chains are preferentially recognized for cleavage (33Nussbaum A.K. Dick T.P. Keilholz W. Schirle M. Stevanovic S. Dietz K. Heinemeyer W. Groll M. Wolf D.H. Huber R. Rammensee H.-G. Schild H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12504-12509Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 36Holzhutter H.G. Frommel C. Kloetzel P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1251-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast, after 24 h of CaM exposure to proteasome, 25 peptides were identified in the mass spectra. The mass distribution for these peptides varied between 672 and 1430 Da, which corresponds to peptide lengths between 6 and 12 amino acids. Of these peptides, eight were uniquely identified (Table I). Although these peptides also involved the preferential cleavage of the peptide bond on the carboxyl-terminal side of side chains previously implicated to enhance the proteolytic susceptibility of protein substrates, it is apparent that the majority of these peptides involve new cleavage sites. In conjunction with the large decrease in the average size of the released peptides after incubation of CaMox with the proteasome for long times, these results suggest that CaMox is initially cleaved into large pieces that are subsequently further degraded by the proteasome.Table IPeptides released after incubation of CaM ox with the 20 S proteasomeIncubation timeSequence1-aPrimary sequence of the proteolytic fragment, where ↓ indicates the amino-terminal cleavage site, and Met(O) corresponds to methionine sulfoxide.Masstheoretical1-bCalculated masses based on monoisotopic mass distribution, except for Q3-K30 and A1-L32, where isotopic masses were not resolved.MassexperimentalErrorDaltonsDaltonsDaltons1 hI↓A10-F191187.61187.60.0E↓E84-D931280.71280.9−0.2E↓A88-Y991387.71387.8−0.1N↓P43-Met(O)-G591861.81861.40.4L↓R106-Met(O)-E1232130.02129.60.4L↓G40-Met(O)-G612332.02332.3−0.3L↓G33-Met(O)-V552547.22547.70.5D↓M51-Met(O)3-A732578.12578.10.0F↓S17-Met(O)-Q412683.32683.30.0A↓D58-Met(O)3-S812767.22767.20.0P↓E67-Met(O)-F892822.32822.6−0.3M↓I52-Met(O)2-K772974.42974.40.0D↓Q3-K303161.53161.30.2AI-L323589.93589.90.024 hT↓N111-L116672.4672.10.3M↓I125-I130714.4714.30.1T↓I27-G33760.4760.20.2R↓K75-Met(O)-E82952.4952.40.0K↓D22-E311034.51034.30.2M↓A73-S811050.51050.20.3L↓F19-K301295.71295.50.2A↓A103-E1141368.71368.50.2There were no ambiguities in the mass assignments of the peptide ions, and all peptides were detected with an accuracy of 0.05% of the theoretical mass of the peptide of interest.1-a Primary sequence of the proteolytic fragment, where ↓ indicates the amino-terminal cleavage site, and Met(O) corresponds to methionine sulfoxide.1-b Calculated masses based on monoisotopic mass distribution, except for Q3-K30 and A1-L32, where isotopic masses were not resolved.

Methionine oxidation has previously been shown to result in a large reduction in the α-helical content of CaM, indicating the methionines function to stabilize the native conformation of CaM (22Sun H. Gao J. Ferrington D.A. Biesiada H. Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 102-112Google Scholar). To determine whether these structural changes may predispose CaMox to degradation by the proteasome, we investigated whether changes in the secondary structure of CaM resulting from methionine oxidation correlate with the sensitivity of degradation by the proteasome. CD spectroscopy was used to estimate changes in the α-helical content of CaM resulting from methionine oxidation. From the CD spectra, it is apparent that a progressive increase in the molar ellipticity ([Θ]) is observed, indicating a loss of secondary structure that correlates with the extent of oxidation (Fig. 5). The α-helical content was calculated using a non-linear least squares-fitting algorithm (34Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). After the oxidation of all nine methionines, approximately one-half of the native α-helical content of CaM is lost. These results confirm that methionine oxidation disrupts the secondary structure of CaM and that the decrease in α-helical content depends on the extent of methionine oxidation. Furthermore, observed changes in the molar ellipticity correlate with the rates of degradation by the proteasome, irrespective of whether the initial release of peptides is measured using the fluorescamine assay or if slower rate of disa"

Growing evidence suggests that many kallikreins are implicated in carcinogenesis. By using molecular cloning techniques, we identified a new human kallikrein gene, tentatively named KLK15 (for kallikrein 15gene). This new gene maps to chromosome 19q13.4 and is located between the KLK1 and KLK3 genes. KLK15 is formed of five coding exons and four introns, and shows structural similarity to other kallikreins and kallikrein-like genes.KLK15 has three alternatively spliced forms and is primarily expressed in the thyroid gland and to a lower extent in the prostate, salivary, and adrenal glands and in the colon testis and kidney. Our preliminary results indicate that the expression of KLK15 is up-regulated by steroid hormones in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. The KLK15 gene is also up-regulated, at the mRNA level, in prostate cancer in comparison to normal prostatic tissue. KLK15 up-regulation was found to be associated with more aggressive forms of prostate cancer. This newly discovered gene has the potential of being used as a diagnostic and/or prognostic marker for prostate cancer.

The term “kallikrein” was first introduced by Werle and colleagues (1Kraut H., K., F.E. Werle E. Physiol. Chem. 1930; 189: 97-106Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Werle E. Biochem. Z. 1934; 269: 415-434Google Scholar) who found high levels of their original isolates in the pancreas (in Greek, the “kallikreas”). Kallikreins are divided into two main groups; the plasma kallikrein, which is a single gene (3Clements J. Farmer S. The Kinin System. Academic Press, New York1997: 71-97Crossref Google Scholar), and the tissue kallikreins, which are encoded by a large multigene family in rodents (4Evans B.A. Drinkwater C.C. Richards R.I. J. Biol.

Until recently, the human kallikrein gene family was thought to consist of only three members (6Riegman P.H. Vlietstra R.J. Suurmeijer L. Cleutjens C.B. Trapman J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, we and others have identified 11 new members of the kallikrein gene family (7Diamandis E.P. Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y.

Luo L.Y. Magklara A. Obiezu C.V. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 54-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA),1 currently the most useful tumor marker for prostate cancer diagnosis and monitoring, is a member of the human kallikrein gene family of serine proteases (19Riegman P.H. Vlietstra R.J. van der Korput J.A. Romijn J.C. Trapman J. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1989; 159: 95-102Google Scholar,20Diamandis E.P. Trends Endocrinol.

In addition to PSA, human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2, encoded by the KLK2 gene) has been proposed as an adjuvant diagnostic marker for prostate cancer (21Stenman U.H. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 753-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Partin A.W. Catalona W.J. Finlay J.A. Darte C. Tindall D.J. Young C.Y. Klee G.G. Chan D.W. Rittenhouse H.G. Wolfert R.L. Woodrum D.L. Urology. 1999; 54: 839-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that other members of the expanded kallikrein gene family may be associated with malignancy (7Diamandis E.P. Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y. Magklara A. Obiezu C.V. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 54-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The normal epithelial cell-specific 1 gene (NES1; KLK10, according to the approved human tissue kallikrein gene nomenclature) was found to be a novel tumor suppressor, which is down-regulated during breast cancer progression (23Goyal J. Smith K.M. Cowan J.M. Wazer D.E. Lee S.W. Band V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4782-4786PubMed Google Scholar). Other gene family members, including zyme (KLK6), neuropsin (KLK8), and human stratum corneum chymotyrptic enzyme (HSCCE; KLK7) were also found to be differentially expressed in certain types of malignancies (24Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Stenman G. Mok S.C. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 624-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tanimoto H. Underwood L.J. Shigemasa K. Yan Yan M.S. Clarke J. Parmley T.H. O'Brien T.J.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4435-4439PubMed Google Scholar). The diagnostic usefulness of PSA in prostate cancer led us to speculate that other, related molecules might be valuable biomarkers for prostate cancer and other malignancies. During our efforts to identify new kallikrein genes that might be involved in malignancy, we cloned a new gene, tentatively named kallikrein 15 gene (KLK15). Here, we describe the identification of the new gene, its genomic and mRNA structure, its location in relation to other known kallikreins, and its tissue expression pattern. The KLK15 gene has another three alternatively spliced forms, expressed in many tissues. Our preliminary data suggest that KLK15 is up-regulated in prostate cancer and that it is under steroid hormone regulation in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. Higher expression of KLK15 is associated with more aggressive (higher stage and higher grade) prostate tumors. We previously constructed the first contiguous map for the human kallikrein gene locus extending from the KLK1 gene (centromere) to the KLK14 gene (telomere) (7Diamandis E.P. Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y.

Overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones spanning this area were identified by screening of a human BAC library using different radiolabeled gene-specific probes. An area of ∼300 kb of genomic sequence was established using different techniques, as described previously (11Yousef G.M. Diamandis E.P. Genomics. 2000; 65: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Yousef G.M. Chang A. Scorilas A. Diamandis E.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 2000; 276: 125-133Google Scholar). By performing an EcoRI restriction analysis, we were able to orient the kallikrein locus along the EcoRI restriction map of chromosome 19q13 available from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). A BAC clone that extends more centromerically (BC 781134) was then identified. Contigs of linear genomic sequences from this clone are available from the LLNL. Initially, we have used these contig sequences to predict the presence of novel genes, using bioinformatic approaches, as described previously (8Yousef G.M. Obiezu C.V. Luo L.Y. Black M.H. Diamandis E.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4252-4256PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y. Diamandis E.P. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 2843-2852PubMed Google Scholar), and a putative new serine protease was identified. The sequence of the putative gene was then verified by different approaches, including sequencing, EST data base search, PCR screening of tissues, as described below. The predicted exons of the putative new gene were subjected to homology search using the BLASTN algorithm (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information web server against the human EST data base (dbEST). Clones with >95% homology were obtained from the IMAGE consortium (29Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) through Research Genetics Inc. (Huntsville, AL). The clones were propagated, purified as described elsewhere (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and sequenced from both directions with an automated sequencer, using insert-flanking vector primers. The LNCaP prostate cancer cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA. Cells were cultured in RPMI media (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with glutamine (200 mm), bovine insulin (10 mg/liter), fetal bovine serum (10%), antibiotics, and antimycotics, in plastic flasks, to near confluency. The cells were then aliquoted into 24-well tissue culture plates and cultured to 50% confluency. 24 h before the experiments, the culture media were changed into phenol red-free media containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. For stimulation experiments, various steroid hormones dissolved in 100% ethanol were added into the culture media at a final concentration of 10−8m. Cells stimulated with 100% ethanol were included as controls. The cells were cultured for 24 h, then harvested for mRNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from the LNCaP cell line or from prostate tissues using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using the Superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The final volume was 20 μl. Based on the combined information obtained from the predicted genomic structure of the new gene and the EST sequences (see below), two gene-specific primers were designed (KLK15-F1 and KLK15-R1) (Table I), and PCR was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 1 μl of cDNA, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs (deoxynucleoside triphosphates), 150 ng of primers, and 2.5 units of HotStar DNA polymerase (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9600 thermal cycler. The cycling conditions were 95 °C for 15 min to activate the Taq DNA polymerase, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. Equal amounts of PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. All primers for RT-PCR spanned at least two exons to avoid contamination by genomic DNA. To verify the identity of the PCR products, they were cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The inserts were sequenced from both directions using vector-specific primers, with an automated DNA sequencer.Table IPrimers used for genomic PCR amplificationGenePrimer name and sequence1-aAll primers are presented in 5′ → 3′ direction.GenBank™ numberKLK1KLK1-A ATC CCT CCA TTC CCA TCT TTL10038KLK1-B CAC ATA CAA TTC TCT GGT TCKLK2KLK2-A AGT GAC ACT GTC TCA GAA TTM18157KLK2-B CCC CAA TCT CAC GAG TGC ACPSAE5-A GTC GGC TCT GGA GAC ATT TCM27274E5-B AAC TGG GGA GGC TTG AGT CKLK15KLK15-F1 CTC CTT CCT GCT GGC ATC CAAF242195KLK15-R1 ATC ACA CGG GTG GTC ATG TGKLK15-F2 CAA GTG GCT CTC TAC GAG CGKLK15-R2 GAC ACC AGG CTT GGT GGT GT1-a All primers are presented in 5′ → 3′ direction. Open table in a new tab Total RNA isolated from 26 different human tissues was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). We prepared cDNA as described above for the tissue culture experiments and used it for PCR reactions. Tissue cDNAs were amplified at various dilutions using two gene-specific primers (KLK15-F2 and KLK15-R1) (Table I). Due to the high degree of homology between kallikreins, and to exclude nonspecific amplification, PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Prostate tissue samples were obtained from 29 patients who had undergone radical retropubic prostatectomy for prostatic adenocarcinoma at the Charite University Hospital, Berlin, Germany. The patients did not receive any hormonal therapy before surgery. The use of these tissues for research purposes was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Charite Hospital. Fresh prostate tissue samples were obtained from the cancerous and non-cancerous parts of the same prostates that had been removed. Small pieces of tissue were dissected immediately after removal of the prostate and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis. Histological analysis from all the tissue pieces was performed as described previously (31Meyer A. Jung K. Lein M. Rudolph B. Schnorr D. Loening S.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to ensure that the tissue was either malignant or benign. The tissues were pulverized with a hammer under liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted as described above, using Trizol reagent. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The analysis of differences between KLK15 expression in non-cancerous versus cancerous tissues from the same patient was performed with the non-parametric McNemar test. The binomial distribution was used to compute the significance level. Prostate tumor KLK15mRNA levels were qualitatively classified into two categories (KLK15-low and KLK15-high groups), and associations between KLK15 status and other variables were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test. Multiple alignment was performed using the ClustalX software package and the multiple alignment program available from the Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). Phylogenetic studies were performed using the Phylip software package. Distance matrix analysis was performed using the Neighbor-Joining/UPGMA program, and parsimony analysis was done using the Protpars program. Hydrophobicity study was performed using the Baylor College of Medicine search launcher. Signal peptide was predicted using the SignalP server. Protein structure analysis was performed by the SAPS (structural analysis of protein sequence) program. A contiguous map for the human kallikrein gene locus extending from the KLK1 gene (centromere) to the KLK14 gene (telomere) was previously established (7Diamandis E.P. Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y.

To investigate the presence of other kallikrein-like genes centromeric to KLK1, a BAC clone (BC 781134) was obtained as described under “Materials and Methods.” According to the published genomic sequence of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and human renal kallikrein (KLK1) genes, we designed gene-specific primers for each of these genes (TableI) and developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification protocols, which allowed us to generate specific PCR products with genomic DNA as a template. PCR screening of the BAC clone by these gene-specific primers indicated that this clone is positive for KLK1 but negative to PSA, thus, confirming its location to be centromeric to PSA. A putative new serine protease was predicted from the sequence of this clone by computer programs as described previously (12Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y. Diamandis E.P. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 2843-2852PubMed Google Scholar). This clone was digested, blotted on a membrane, and hybridized with gene-specific primers for the putative KLK15 gene (according to the predicted sequence), and positive fragments were subcloned and sequenced to verify the structure of the putative gene. This putative gene sequence was then compared using the BLASTN program against the human EST data base, and two EST clones were identified (GenBank™ accession numbers AW274270 and AW205420). These two clones were 99% identical to the last exon and the 3′-untranslated region of the gene, and the second EST ends with a stretch of 17 adenine (A) nucleotides that were not found in the genomic sequence, thus verifying the 3′-end of the gene and the position of the poly(A) tail. To identify the full mRNA structure of the gene and to determine the exon/intron boundaries, PCR reactions were performed using primers located in different computer-predicted exons, using a panel of 26 human tissue cDNAs as templates. PCR products were sequenced. Two of these primers (KLK15-F1 and KLK15-R1) (Table I) were able to amplify the full coding region of the gene from different tissues. Comparing the mRNA with the genomic structure indicated the presence of a gene formed from five coding exons with four intervening introns. Translation of the mRNA sequence in all possible reading frames revealed the presence of only one frame that gives an uninterrupted polypeptide chain, which also contains the highly conserved structural motifs of the kallikreins, as discussed below. As shown in Fig. 1, the KLK15 gene is formed of five coding exons and four intervening introns, although, as with other kallikrein genes, the presence of further upstream untranslated exon(s) could not be ruled out (17Yoshida S. Taniguchi M. Hirata A. Shiosaka S. Gene. 1998; 213: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Luo L. Herbrick J.A. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Squire J. Diamandis E.P. Biochem. Cell Biol.

All of the exon/intron splice sites conform to the consensus sequence for eukaryotic splice sites (34Iida Y. J. Theor. Biol. 1990; 145: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The gene further follows strictly the common structural features of other members of the human kallikrein multigene family, as described below. The predicted protein-coding region of the gene is formed of 771 bp, encoding a deduced 256-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 28.1 kDa. The potential translation initiation codon matches the consensus Kozak sequence (35Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), moreover, there is a purine at position −3, which occurs in 97% of vertebrate mRNAs (36Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4164) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that, like most other kallikrein-like genes, KLK15 does not have the consensus G nucleotide at position +4. Nucleotides 7764–7769 (ATTAAA) (the numbers refer to our GenBank™ submission number AF242195) closely resemble a consensus polyadenylation signal (37Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar) and are followed, after 17 nucleotides, by the poly(A) tail. No other potential polyadenylation signals were discernible in the 3′-untranslated region, suggesting that the above sequence is the actual polyadenylation signal. Although AATAAA is highly conserved, natural variants do occur, and the ATTAAA sequence is reported to occur as a natural polyadenylation variant in 12% of vertebrate mRNA sequences (38Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The presence of glutamic acid (E) at position 203 suggests that KLK15 will likely possess a unique substrate specificity. PSA has a serine (S) residue in the corresponding position and has chymotryptic-like activity. Many other kallikreins usually have aspartate (D) in this position, indicating a trypsin-like activity (Fig. 2) (6Riegman P.H. Vlietstra R.J. Suurmeijer L. Cleutjens C.B. Trapman J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although the KLK15 protein sequence is unique, comparative analysis revealed that it has a considerable degree of homology with other members of the kallikrein multigene family. KLK15 shows 51% protein identity and 66% similarity with the trypsin-like serine protease (TLSP) and 49% and 48% identity with the neuropsin and KLK-L3 proteins, respectively. Hydrophobicity analysis revealed that the amino-terminal region is quite hydrophobic (Fig.3), consistent with the possibility that this region harbors a signal sequence, analogous to other serine proteases. Computer analysis of the KLK15 protein sequence predicted a cleavage site between amino acids 16 and 17 (TAA-QD). Sequence alignment (Fig. 2) also revealed another potential cleavage site (Lys21), at a site homologous to the activation site of other serine proteases (lysine (K) or arginine (R) is present in most cases) (39Keil B. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3. Academic Press, New York1971: 249-275Google Scholar). Several evenly distributed hydrophobic regions throughout the KLK15 polypeptide are consistent with a globular protein, similar to other kallikreins and serine proteases. Thus, as is the case with other kallikreins, and although direct experimental evidence is lacking, KLK15 is presumably translated as an inactive 256-amino acid preproenzyme precursor. Prepro-KLK15 has 21 additional residues, which constitute the preregion (the signal peptide formed of 16 residues), and the propeptide (5 residues). The dotted area in Fig. 2 indicates an 11-amino acid loop characteristic of the classical kallikreins (PSA, KLK1, and KLK2) but not found in KLK15 or other members of the kallikrein multigene family (10Yousef G.M.

However, KLK15 has a unique 8-amino acid loop (HNEPGTAG) at positions 148–155, not found in any other kallikrein (Fig. 2). 29 “invariant” amino acids surrounding the active site of serine proteases have been described (40Dayhoff M.O. Natl. Biomed. Res. Found. 1978; 5: 79-81Google Scholar). Of these, 28 are conserved in KLK15. One of the unconserved amino acids (Ser173instead of Pro) is also found in prostase, KLK-L2, and KLK-L5 proteins, and represents a conserved evolutionary change to a protein of the same group, according to protein evolution studies (41Miyata T. Miyazawa S. Yasunaga T. J. Mol. Evol. 1979; 12: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Twelve cysteine residues are present in the putative mature KLK15 protein; 10 of them are conserved in all kallikreins and would be expected to form disulfide bridges. The other two (Cys131 and Cys243) are not found in PSA, KLK1,KLK2, or KLK-L4, however, they are found in similar positions in all other kallikrein genes and are expected to form an additional disulfide bond. To predict the phylogenetic relatedness of the KLK15 protein with other serine proteases, the amino acid sequences were aligned together using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and the Neighbor-Joining distance matrix methods, and the Protpars parsimony method. All phylogenetic trees obtained agreed that other serine proteases (non-kallikreins) can be grouped together as a separate group, indicating that kallikreins represent a separate step in the evolution of serine proteases. KLK15 was grouped with the KLK-L3 and TLSP (Fig. 4) and the classical kallikreins (hK1, hK2, and PSA) are grouped together in all trees, suggesting that the separation between classical kallikreins and the kallikrein-like genes occurred early during evolution, consistent with suggestions of previous studies (13Nelson P.S. Gan L. Ferguson C. Moss P. Gelinas R. Hood L. Wang K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3114-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). PCR screening for KLK15 transcripts using gene-specific primers (KLK15-F2 and KLK15-R2) (Table I) revealed the presence of three bands in most of the tissue cDNAs examined (Fig. 7). These bands were gel-purified, cloned, and sequenced. The upper band represents the classical form of the gene, and the lower band is splice variant 3 (Fig. 5). The middle band represents other two-splice variants. Restriction digestion of the PCR product of the middle band with StuI, followed by gel separation, purification, and sequencing, revealed that it is composed of splice variants 1 and 2, which have approximately the same length (splice variant 1 has exon 4 (137 bp) but is missing 118 bp from exon 3, whereas splice variant 2 has an additional 118 bp of exon 3 but missing exon 4. All splice variants are expected to encode for truncated protein products (Fig. 5).Figure 5Schematic presentation of the different splice variants of the KLK15 gene. Exons are shown by boxes and introns by the connecting lines. Numbers inside boxes represent the exons lengths in base pairs.

https://openalex.org/W2071281071,"Abstract Neuromedin U is a neuropeptide prominently expressed in the upper gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Recently, GPR66/FM-3 (NmU-R1) was identified as a specific receptor for neuromedin U. A BLAST search of the GenBankTM genomic database using the NmU-R1 cDNA sequence revealed a human genomic fragment encoding a G protein-coupled receptor that we designated NmU-R2 based on its homology to NmU-R1. The full-length NmU-R2 cDNA was subsequently cloned, stably expressed in 293 cells, and shown to mobilize intracellular calcium in response to neuromedin U. This response was dose-dependent (EC50 = 5 nm) and specific in that other neuromedins did not induce a calcium flux in receptor-transfected cells. Expression analysis of human NmU-R2 demonstrated its mRNA to be most highly expressed in central nervous system tissues. Based on these data, we conclude that NmU-R2 is a novel neuromedin U receptor subtype that is likely to mediate central nervous system-specific neuromedin U effects."

These strictly aerobic, nonfermentative, chemoorganotrophic bacteria rarely attack sugars, but grow well on organic acids and amino acids (1Willems A. deVos P. deLey J. Balows A. Trueper H.G. Dworkin M. The Procaryotes: A Handbook on the Biology of Bacteria, Ecophysiology, Isolation, Identification and Applications. Springer-Verlag, New York1992: 2583-2590Google Scholar). Comamonas testosteroni is able to use steroids as a sole carbon source (2Talalay P. Dobson M.M. Tapley D.F. Nature. 1952; 170: 620-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and may be an attractive means for the removal of these stable compounds from the environment. The presence of testosterone induces in this organism the expression of a set of genes encoding steroid catabolizing enzymes (3Möbus E. Jahn M. Schmid R. Jahn D. Maser E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5951-5955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these enzymes, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase (3α-HSDH),1 mediates the oxidoreduction at position 3 of the steroid nucleus of a great variety of C19–27 steroids. This reaction is of importance in the initiation of the complete degradation of these relatively inert substrates. In addition, 3α-HSDH accepts a wide spectrum of xenobiotic molecules such as metyrapone or the significantly smallerp-nitrobenzaldehyde as substrates (4Oppermann U.C. Maser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Möbus E. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30888-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As a consequence, in the presence of a steroidal inductor not only the resistance ofC. testosteroni to the steroid antibiotic fusidic acid but also the metabolic capacity of insecticide degradation are significantly enhanced (6Oppermann U.C. Belai I. Maser E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 3α-HSDH from C. testosteroni is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. Despite the fact that the amino acid identity among the members of this family is only in the 15 to 30% range, they reveal a striking similarity in their tertiary structure. Their overall structure is based upon a typical dinucleotide binding motif or Rossmann fold composed of βαβ units, which build up a parallel β-sheet sandwiched between two arrays of parallel α-helices (7Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Bränden C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar). Most SDR enzymes are either homodimers or -tetramers and all require NAD(H) or NADP(H) as a cofactor (8Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). The 3α-HSDH primary structure shows two sequence motifs which are common to the members of the SDR family. These are the amino-terminal Gly8-X-X-X-Gly12-X-Gly14cofactor binding motif and the Tyr155-X-X-X-Lys159motif (5Möbus E. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30888-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) which is structurally located in the active site and forms together with the conserved Ser114 a catalytic triad (numbering according to the 3α-HSDH primary structure). Probably all SDRs share a common reaction mechanism, which follows a compulsory ordered pathway with the cofactor binding first. Upon binding of the hydroxyl or carbonyl substrate a so-called substrate binding loop, which is highly flexible in most apo-SDRs, becomes well ordered and covers the substrate as well as the catalytic center from aqueous environment. The transfer of a hydride ion is accompanied by a proton transfer via the Tyr residue of the catalytic triad. The catalytic Ser orients the substrate and stabilizes the transient reaction intermediate. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the deprotonated Ser may act as a catalytic base with Tyr playing a subsidiary role during catalysis (9Winberg J.O. Brendskag M.K. Sylte I. Lindstad R.I. McKinley-McKee J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The dual role of the Lys in the catalytic triad is the proper orientation of the cofactor by forming hydrogen bonds to the nicotinamide-ribose moiety and to lower the pKaof the catalytic Tyr via electrostatic interaction (10Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 11Auerbach G. Herrmann A. Gutlich M. Fischer M. Jacob U.

Biol. 1999; 289: 335-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of C. testosteroni3α-HSDH in its apo, as well as, in its NAD+ bound form. While the catalytic triad of 3α-HSDH and the conformation of the bound dinucleotide cofactor are well superimposable with those found in other SDRs of known structure, the enzyme reveals an oligomerization mode which is so far unique within the SDR family. Overexpression of the gene encodingC. testosteroni 3α-HSDH in Escherichia coli and purification of the recombinant protein were performed as described previously (5Möbus E. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30888-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All crystallization experiments were carried out in Linbro cell culture plates using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion technique. Initial crystallization conditions were obtained using the Crystal screen kit from Hampton-Research. For this initial screen 1.5 μl of protein solution (5 g/liter 3α-HSDH protein in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol) was mixed with 1.5 μl of reservoir solution which was then sealed against the reservoir. The screen was carried out in parallel at 277 and 293 K. After a period of 1 week, small single crystals were obtained at 277 K with screening solution number 22 (30% PEG 4000, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 0.2 m sodium acetate). With refined crystallization conditions (25–30% PEG 4000, 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, and 0.2 mammonium acetate) crystals grew to a size of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.4 mm within a period of 3 weeks. The size of the crystals was further improved by macroseeding and lowering the precipitant concentration to 20%, which resulted in crystals with dimensions of approximately 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.8 mm. Data sets were collected on a Rigaku rotating-anode generator (Rigaku/MSC) operating at 50 kV and 100 mA and equipped with focusing mirrors (MSC/Yale) and an RAXIS IV image plate detector. Crystals were flash-cooled in nylon-fiber loops in a 100 K nitrogen gas stream provided by an X-stream cryo system. As a cryo buffer reservoir solution with 20% (v/v) glycerol was used. Raw data indexing and processing was done within DENZO and XDISP (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The pre-processed data were then scaled and merged using SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Initial phasing of the native dataset was carried out by the molecular replacement method (14Rossman M.G. Blow D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1962; 15: 24-31Crossref Google Scholar) by means of the program AMoRe (15Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite (16Number 4 Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Patterson rotation and translation search were carried out with the coordinates of the poly-alanine trace of one monomer of tropinone reductase II (Protein DataBand code 2ae1) (17Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Akama H. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Hashimoto T. Oda J. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4876-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) after removal of helix αC and the substrate binding loop. The best solution from the rotation function search (Table I) was kept fixed for the translation search of the second molecule. The best solution emerging from the translation function search (TableII) could then be clearly distinguished from all other (wrong) solutions by means of correlation coefficient and R-factor. With two monomers oriented according to the two solutions a sensible dimer could be formed. The model was then subjected to a rigid body and a 3000 K simulated annealing (SA) refinement with the program CNS (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) using data from 8 to 3.5 Å and 8 to 2 Å, respectively. Refinement was carried out with non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints. After a first visual inspection of this initial model in conjunction with an electron density map calculated with the model phases, 110 residues creating some difficulties with respect to the dimerization contacts and crystal packing were removed. Appropriate side chains corresponding to the 3α-HSDH sequence were then introduced. The side chain conformation was chosen similar to the conformation of homologous residues in other SDR structures, when possible. After another 3000 K SA refinement and an individual B-factor refinement in CNS (data in the resolution range from 8 to 1.68 Å) a 2Fobs −Fcalc and an Fobs −Fcalc map were calculated. Due to insufficient quality of these maps for model building and manual model refinement, density modification techniques (solvent flattening, histogram matching, 2-fold non-crystallographic averaging with phase extension) were applied using the program DM from the CCP4 suite. Initial phases were calculated from the model within CNS and figure of merit estimates generated by the program SIGMAA (16Number 4 Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The initial NCS-averaging mask covering one monomer and the solvent-flattening mask covering the dimer were generated with the program MAMA (19Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. SERC, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1994: 59-66Google Scholar) after filling putative regions lacking model fragments with dummy atoms. 35 cycles of density modification were applied within DM updating the NCS-averaging and solvent-flattening masks every 5 cycles. A weighted electron density map was calculated using the improved phases and figure of merit estimates. For all density modifications and subsequent map calculations the full resolution range (99 to 1.68 Å) was used. The resulting map enabled us to build an additional helix-loop-helix domain in the residue range from 120 to 149 and to accomplish some minor corrections to the model. Some 40 residues which did not fit the density were removed. After these manual corrections a 3000 K SA refinement and an individual B-factor refinement in the CNS using data from 8 to 1.68 Å were carried out. Phases and figure of merit estimates were calculated from the improved model and new averaging and solvent-flattening masks were generated. After running 35 cycles of density modification with DM, the resulting map and the model were again inspected manually. Within a total of four of these refinement cycles the whole model could be built, lacking only residues 188 to 208 forming a putative loop region where no appropriate density could be found. In this stage, water molecules were fit into the model using the appropriate CNS script. A bulk solvent correction was then introduced and a 1000 K SA refinement including an individual B-factor refinement were performed in CNS using all available data within the 99 to 1.68 Å range. NCS restraints were released at this stage. After inclusion of a total of 405 water molecules, some additional manual fine tuning and automated refinement, including an overall anisotropic B-factor refinement, a final R/Rfree of 20.0/22.9% has been achieved.Table IMolecular replacement statistics: rotation function searchNo.αβγcorr°°°1315.6592.13266.308.42109.97107.36229.527.8343.5029.00269.007.34270.7876.9779.107.35222.34108.9563.577.3658.94150.29149.297.37233.89121.2643.147.28303.3292.59260.457.29216.00149.0121.167.010119.78127.5461.256.8The best 10 solutions of the rotation function are shown as output from AMoRe.

The apo-3α-HSDH model was used as an initial model for refinement against all datasets measured from crystals grown in the presence of enzyme substrates. A 1500 K SA and individual B-factor refinement against each dataset were carried out using data sampled over the whole resolution range in conjunction with a bulk solvent correction. 2Fobs −Fcalc and Fobs −Fcalc maps were then inspected for density corresponding to bound substrate. The quality of the models was assessed using the programs PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) (Ramachandran diagrams) and O (21Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M.

The contact area of the two NCS related monomers as well as the area of the three major crystal contacts of the complete dimer was calculated using the program GA_FIT (22May A.C. Johnson M.S.

The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (codes: 1fjhfor apo-3α-HSDH and 1fk8 for the 3α-HSDH●NAD+complex). The structures of 3α-HSDH in its apo and in its NAD+ bound form were solved by molecular replacement using tropinone reductase II (17Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Akama H. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Hashimoto T. Oda J. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4876-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as a search model. The structures were refined at a resolution of 1.68 and 1.95 Å, respectively, and show good stereochemistry with 91% of all model residues in the most favored and no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table III. Comparison of both structures clearly shows that binding of NAD+ has no influence on the conformation of 3α-HSDH and therefore both structures are virtually identical apart from the presence or absence of the cofactor. The crystal structure reveals one homodimer per asymmetric unit representing the physiologically active entity (24Maser E. Möbus E. Xiong G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the monomeric subunit of 3α-HSDH shows a typical SDR architecture, its topology differs in some details from that of other members within this protein family (Figs. 1 and 2). The canonical structural motif of SDR proteins is a dinucleotide binding or Rossmann fold consisting of βαβ units forming a central six-stranded parallel β-sheet sandwiched between two arrays of α-helices (7Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Bränden C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar). In all SDRs this fold is extended at its COOH terminus by at least one additional α-helix (αG) and a seventh parallel β-strand (βG). Fig. 2 shows the folding topology of 3α-HSDH compared with those of two further representatives of the SDR family. Obviously, the Rossmann fold motif (extending from the amino terminus through strand βF) is truncated in 3α-HSDH, since it lacks helix αC and has an only rudimentarily left strand βC. A similar truncation of this structural element is present in the structures of the SDRs dihydropterin reductase (25Varughese K.I. Skinner M.M. Whiteley J.M. Matthews D.A. Xuong N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6080-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and GDP-fucose synthetase (26Somers W.S. Stahl M.L. Sullivan F.X. Structure. 1998; 6: 1601-1612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is an insertion of 28 amino acids within the Rossmann fold motif in 3α-HSDH between strand βE and helix αF (Figs. 2 and 3) forming a predominantly α-helical subdomain. This insertion which has no correspondence in any other SDR of known structure, has an important implication in the oligomerization properties of 3α-HSDH (see below).Table IIICrystallographic data and refinement statisticsApo-proteinBinary complexData collection Maximum resolution (Å)1.651.95 Wavelength (Å)1.54181.5418 Temperature (K)100100 Space groupP1P1 Unit cell parameters Åa = 43.3a = 42.8b = 46.2b = 46.2c= 65.3c = 65.0Degree (°)α = 106.5α = 107.5β = 106.6β = 106.3γ = 98.8γ = 97.6 No. of observed reflections374,072233,945 No. of unique reflections50,14030,053 Completeness (%)Overall97.793.3Last shell74.090.5 Rsym 3-aRsym = Σ‖I − 〈I〉‖/ΣI, whereI is the observed intensity and 〈I〉 is the average intensity for multiple measurements.

Möbus E. Xiong G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the spatial relationship between the dimer subunits observed in the 3α-HSDH structure, the subunit arrangement of homotetrameric SDRs will be discussed at first to serve as a reference. All structures of homotetrameric SDRs determined so far exhibit two main subunit interfaces arranged about two non-crystallographic 2-fold axes which are perpendicular to each other and referred to as P and Q (Fig. 4 A) (10Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 27Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Hara A. Mitsui Y. Structure. 1996; 4: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). TheP-axis interface is mainly formed by the αG helices and by side chain-to-main chain interactions between the βG strands of two neighboring subunits. The Q-axis interface mainly consists of a four helix bundle composed of helices αE and αF of two interacting subunits. In all homodimeric SDRs, whose structures have been determined so far, dimerization occurs along an interface corresponding to the Q-axis interface of tetrameric SDRs (Fig. 4, A and B). This mode of dimerization is, however, sterically impossible in 3α-HSDH because of the 28 amino acids insertion into the classical Rossmann fold motif between strand βE and helix αF (gray colored sector in Fig. 4 C). This insertion, mainly composed by α-helical sections, is masking the Rossmann fold helices αE and αF, thus preventing the formation of a four-helix bundle. As a consequence, in 3α-HSDH dimerization takes place via a P-axis interface. The subunit contacts are formed by side chain-to-side chain interactions of two βG strands as well as by the parallel packing of two αG-helices against each other (Fig. 4 C). In addition, the carboxyl-terminal helix αCT of each subunit is packing against the αF helix of the other subunit. Dimerization about a P-axis interface has been discussed as a possible mode of oligomerization in SDRs (28Krook M. Ghosh D. Duax W. Jörnvall H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but has never been observed in a crystal structure so far. The oligomerization contacts can clearly be distinguished from pure crystal contacts, since the contact surface involved in dimerization (about 1900 Å2per monomer) by far exceeds the total buried solvent-accessible surface area created by any of the three observed major crystal contacts (160 to 280 Å2 per monomer) (TableIV).Table IVContact areas of symmetry related molecules observed in 3α-HSDH crystalsSymmetry operationContact area of the symmetry related molecules (Å2) calculated for one monomerTranslation of the dimer along a158Translation of the dimer alongb281Translation of the dimer alongc266NCS of the two monomers1906 Open table in a new tab Three residues, namely Ser114, Tyr155, and Lys159 in 3α-HSDH, form a triad essential for catalysis and well conserved within the SDR family. The arrangement of these amino acids within 3α-HSDH is virtually identical to that in other SDRs of known structure emphasizing the probability of a common reaction mechanism within this protein family. Likewise, in the binary complex the NAD+ cofactor, which is bound at the carboxyl-terminal ends of the β-strands is well superimposable with the cofactors present in other binary or ternary complexes of SDRs. Accordingly, both ribose rings are present as 2′endo-conformers. The nicotinamide ring is bound in asyn and the adenine base in an anti-torsion angle to the respective ribose moiety. As expected, the orientation of the nicotinamide ring with respect to the catalytic triad is also very similar to what is observed in other SDR·NAD(P)(H) complexes. The structure suggests that 3α-HSDH depends on NAD(H) and will hardly accept NADP(H) as a cofactor. The side chain carboxylate of Asp32, a residue highly conserved among enzymes preferring NAD(H) (29Nakanishi M. Matsuura K. Kaibe H. Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Hara A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2218-2222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), forms hydrogen bonds to both the 2′ and the 3′ OH group of the adenosine ribose. Accordingly, a potential phosphate group linked to the 2′ position of the adenosine moiety would create unfavorable contacts in this area. In addition, in the observed conformation the side chain of the neighboring Ile33 would impede the presence of a phosphate for sterical reasons (Fig. 5). The preference of NAD(H) with respect to NADP(H), which can be inferred from the structure presented, supports the catabolic nature of 3α-HSDH. In the structures of many SDR enzymes, the so-called substrate binding loop (consisting of residues 188 to 213 in 3α-HSDH) is almost completely disordered in the absence of a bound cofactor and substrate. After binding of the dinucleotide cofactor a minor portion of this loop may become stabilized and only after binding of the hydroxyl/carbonyl substrate it adopts a defined, usually helical, conformation. Substrate specificity of SDRs is largely conveyed by this loop. In many SDRs its flexibility and adaptability is assumed to be responsible for the broad spectrum of accepted substrates commonly observed for these enzymes. In the structure of apo-3α-HSDH alike no or only poorly defined electron density is detected for the major part of the substrate binding loop apart from residues 209 to 213 which are clearly defined. In the crystal structure of 3α-HSDH complexed to NAD+ residues 188 to 192 become visible in one of the two subunits. However, the better defined electron density in this region compared with the second subunit or the apo-form is very subtle and may not necessarily result from NAD+binding. To obtain some insight on how substrate recognition and thus specificity are achieved in 3α-HSDH, we tried to obtain crystals of a ternary complex. This was attempted by soaking several steroids or xenobiotics into freshly grown crystals of a 3α-HSDH·NAD+ complex or by co-crystallizing these compounds together with NAD+ and 3α-HSDH under the conditions yielding crystals of the binary complex. These trials failed, however. A closer inspection of the arrangement of the protein molecules within the crystal showed that a fully ordered state of the substrate binding loop would be inconsistent with crystal packing, thus making the success of soaking experiments impossible. The most remarkable feature of 3α-HSDH is an extended insertion within the Rossmann fold between strand βE and helix αF preventing the formation of aQ-axis type oligomerization interface which is present in all other homotetrameric and homodimeric SDRs of known structure. Since no residues of this insertion are either in contact with the catalytic center or with the putative substrate-binding site or the cosubstrate-binding site, the question about its function appears mandatory. It is tempting to speculate that the oligomerization mode of 3α-HSDH, which is likely to result from this insertion and which is so far unique among SDRs, might drive cooperativity among the subunits. The only presently available kinetic evidence for such cooperativity among SDR subunits was collected for twocis-retinol/3α-hydroxysterol short chain dehydrogenase isoenzymes, which reveal both sigmoidal and Michaelis-Menten kinetics depending on the substrate (30Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Su J. Chai X. Kahn B. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17910-17916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It must be noted, however, that the kinetic data for these isoenzymes have not been determined by means of the purified enzymes but by means of total cell extracts, thus suggesting not very conclusive results. A potential cooperativity among the subunits of an SDR has been discussed with respect to the crystal structure of the homotetrameric 3α,20β-HSDH from Streptomyces hydrogenans (10Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 32Ghosh D. Erman M. Wawrzak Z. Duax W.L. Pangborn W. Structure. 1994; 2: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which shows that residues from three subunits are lining up each substrate binding pocket. Cooperativity was proposed to be mediated by helix αF which harbors the catalytic Lys and Tyr and contributes in 3α,20β-HSDH to the formation of the substrate binding pocket of another, Q-axis related, subunit. In 3α-HSDH, however, subunits are not related by aQ-axis. No residues of the second subunit approach close enough to contribute to the formation of the substrate binding pocket of the first subunit, assuming that substrates are bound in 3α-HSDH at a site similar to other SDRs. A potential cooperativity in 3α-HSDH might be achieved via the substrate binding loop, whose carboxyl-terminal residues (209 to 213) contact in the presented structure the carboxyl-terminal parts of loops αF and αG of the second subunit. It thus may well transmit the information of substrate binding to one subunit via conformational changes to the second. It cannot be excluded, however, that the conformation of residues 209 to 213 as detected in the presented structure result from crystal packing and do not mirror the same situation in solution."
https://openalex.org/W2067832283,"We have investigated the ability of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase MKK6 to activate different members of the p38 subfamily of MAPKs and found that some MKK6 mutants can efficiently activate p38alpha but not p38gamma. In contrast, a constitutively active MKK6 mutant activated both p38 MAPK isoforms to similar extents. The same results were obtained upon co-expression in Xenopus oocytes and in vitro using either MKK6 immunoprecipitates from transfected cells or bacterially produced recombinant proteins. We also found that the preferential activation of p38alpha by MKK6 correlated with more efficient binding of MKK6 to p38alpha than to p38gamma. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of constitutively active MKK6 differentially activated either p38alpha alone (low MKK6 activity) or both p38alpha and p38gamma (high MKK6 activity), both in vitro and in injected oocytes. The determinants for selectivity are located at the carboxyl-terminal lobe of p38 MAPKs but do not correspond to the activation loop or common docking sequences. We also showed that different stimuli can induce different levels of endogenous MKK6 activity that correlate with differential activation of p38 MAPKs. Our results suggest that the level of MKK6 activity triggered by a given stimulus may determine the pattern of downstream p38 MAPK activation in the particular response."
https://openalex.org/W2039923059,"In nonexcitable cells, we had previously established that Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases, whether expressed endogenously or heterologously, were regulated exclusively by capacitative Ca2+ entry (Fagan, K. A., Mahey, R. and Cooper, D. M. F. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 12438–12444; Fagan, K. A., Mons, N., and Cooper, D. M. F. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 9297–9305). Relatively little is known about how these enzymes are regulated by Ca2+ in excitable cells, where they predominate. Furthermore, no effort has been made to determine whether the prominent voltage-gated Ca2+ entry, which typifies excitable cells, overwhelms the effect of any capacitative Ca2+ entry that may occur. In the present study, we placed the Ca2+-stimulable, adenylyl cyclase type VIII in an adenovirus vector to optimize its expression in the pituitary-derived GH4C1 cell line. In these cells, a modest degree of capacitative Ca2+ entry could be discerned in the face of a dramatic voltage-gated Ca2+ entry. Nevertheless, both modes of Ca2+ entry were equally efficacious at stimulating adenylyl cyclase. A striking release of Ca2+from intracellular stores, triggered either by ionophore or thyrotrophin-releasing hormone, was incapable of stimulating the adenylyl cyclase. It thus appears as though the intimate colocalization of adenylyl cyclase with capacitative Ca2+ entry channels is an intrinsic property of these molecules, regardless of whether they are expressed in excitable or nonexcitable cells. In nonexcitable cells, we had previously established that Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases, whether expressed endogenously or heterologously, were regulated exclusively by capacitative Ca2+ entry (Fagan, K.

The fact that these cyclases are regulated by Ca2+ entering the cells ensures an acute response of the cAMP-generating system to the elevation of [Ca2+]i.1In nonexcitable cells, we have previously shown a strict dependence for capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) as the mode of [Ca2+]i elevation that would regulate Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases, whether they were expressed endogenously or heterologously (2Fagan K.A.

In particular, Ca2+ released from internal stores by any mechanism was unable to regulate adenylyl cyclase activity (4Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

Although the endogenous Ca2+-stimulable adenylyl cyclase of cerebellar granule cells (8Cooper D.M.F. Schell M.J. Thorn P. Irvine R.F. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) is stimulated by Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), it is not known whether adenylyl cyclases in excitable cells are as discriminating as those expressed in nonexcitable cells for the nature of the Ca2+rise to which they respond. In the present study, the Ca2+-stimulable ACVIII was placed in an adenovirus vector to provide efficient expression in the excitable, anterior pituitary-derived tumor line, GH4C1. GH4C1 cells are spontaneously electrically active and express VGCCs that give rise to prominent intracellular rises in [Ca2+]i upon membrane depolarization (10Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). They also express TRH receptors coupled to phospholipase C that elevate [Ca2+]i both by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-linked mechanisms and by modifying the activity of VGCCs (11Mollard P. Dufy B. Vacher P. Barker J.L. Schlegel W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It seemed possible that GH4C1 cells, like most neuronal cells, might not display prominent CCE; however, if CCE was detectable, the opportunity would be provided to determine whether any selectivity was displayed in the regulation of the adenylyl cyclase for either type of [Ca2+]i rise in the same cell type. Thapsigargin and forskolin were from Calbiochem. [2-3H]Adenine and [α-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fura-2/AM and pluronic acid were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Other reagents were from Sigma. Viruses were constructed and propagated using HEK 293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line transformed by and expressing high levels of Ad5 E1A and E1B proteins (12Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (3497) Google Scholar). The virus used for recombination was Ad5dl327Bstβ-gal, which encodes LacZ in place of the E1A and E1B genes and permits color screening for recombinant viruses (13Schaack J. Langer S. Guo X.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3920-3923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ad5dl327Bstβ-gal was purified after infection of HEK 293 cells at maximal cytopathic effect, releasing the virus from the concentrated cell pellet by three cycles of rapid freezing and thawing; the cell debris was pelleted and re-extracted twice by resuspension in a small volume of phosphate-buffered saline followed by rapid freezing and thawing and pelleting of the cell debris. The supernatants were combined and banded for 50 min at 36,000 rpm using a CsCl step gradient consisting of 1 ml of 1.4 g/ml CsCl in phosphate-buffered saline and 1.5 ml of 1.25 g/ml CsCl in phosphate-buffered saline in a SW40 rotor. The virion band was collected by side puncture, diluted in 1.35 g/ml CsCl in phosphate-buffered saline, and rebanded for 3 h at 65,000 rpm in a VTi65 rotor. The virion band was again collected by side puncture. To prepare Ad5dl327Bstβ-gal-terminal protein (TP) complex, the sample was diluted in 4 m guanidine-HCl and 2.8 m CsCl (14Jones N. Shenk T. Cell. 1978; 13: 181-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and banded overnight at 65,000 rpm using a VTi65 rotor. The gradient was fractionated by dripping and fractions containing DNA were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis of aliquots. DNA-containing fractions were combined and dialyzedversus 6 changes of 2 liters each of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA at 4 °C. The presence of TP on the DNA greatly increases the infectivity after transfection (15Chinnadurai G. Chinnadurai S. Green M. J. Virol. 1978; 26: 195-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably due to both increased nuclear uptake facilitated by the nuclear localization signal in TP and protection of the DNA from degradation. Ad5dl327Bstβ-gal-TP was digested withBstBI. For analysis of the completion of digestion, an aliquot was digested with proteinase K before agarose gel electrophoresis. BstBI-digested Ad5dl327Bstβ-gal-TP was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. A cDNA encoding ACVIII was cloned into pACCMV under the control of the cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter (CMV promoter; Ref. 16Gomez-foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield pACCMV-ACVIII, which places expression under the control of the CMV promoter, and into the plasmid pXC15E1A#12 to yield pXC15E1A-ACVIII, which places expression under the control of the adenovirus type 5 E1A promoter. pXC15E1A-ACVIII was further modified by insertion of a BstBI adaptor in the SalI site between the 3′ end of the ACVIII coding sequence and the sequences encoding the intron and poly(A) sites (which are contributed by the 3′ end of the E1B gene) to generate pXC15E1A-ACVIIIBst. HEK 293 cells at approximately 70% confluence were transfected using a modified calcium phosphate procedure (17Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) using 6 μg of plasmid DNA and approximately 0.2 μg of Ad5dl327Bstβ-gal-TP complex. Cells were incubated with the transfection solution overnight before being fed with fresh medium. Because cAMP is a prominent regulator of cell growth and numerous cellular processes, it would be expected that adenylyl cyclase expression would be tightly regulated and constrained to low levels (18Pastan I.

Thus, whereas attempts were made to construct transducing viruses placing ACVIII expression under the control of both the strong CMV promoter and weaker E1A promoters, it was expected that the use of the E1A promoter would yield a virus that directed expression at a level closer to the normal level. The use of the E1A promoter was also expected to make construction and growth of the virus easier because high-level expression of the cyclase might be expected to alter expression of a variety of genes and interfere specifically with regulation of adenovirus gene expression (e.g., Refs. 19Engel D.A.

In addition to being a generally weaker promoter than the CMV promoter, the activity of the E1A promoter is inhibited by the high level of E1A protein expressed in HEK 293 cells (23 and data not shown). Attempts to introduce pXC15E1A-ACVIII into BstBI-digested Ad5dl327Bstβ-gal-TP by standard overlap recombination (13Schaack J. Langer S. Guo X.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3920-3923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chinnadurai G. Chinnadurai S. Brusca J. J. Virol. 1979; 32: 623-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. As an alternative, ligation of the modified plasmid, pXC15E1A-ACVIIIBst, with the large, right arm of the adenovirus chromosome-TP complex was used. 6 μg of pXC15E1A#12-ACVIIIBst was digested withBstBI to generate a ligation site for the viral arm and withXmnI, which cleaves in the β-lactamase coding sequence within the plasmid vector backbone to leave a blunt end, to inhibit recircularization of the plasmid as well as ligation to form concatamers. The restriction enzyme-digested plasmid was ligated with Ad5dl327Bstβ-gal-TP complex that had been digested with BstBI. The ligation mix was used to transfect HEK 293 cells to generate the virus. It was expected that expression of ACVIII during the transfection would be significantly reduced because of the reduction in the number of ACVIII templates that contained exon and poly(A) sequences. Furthermore, direct ligation with the large arm of Ad5dl327Bstβ-gal-TP complex was expected to efficiently introduce the E1A-ACVIII cassette into the virus. Ligation to the large arm of adenovirus restores the intron and a poly(A) site provided by the 3′ end of the E1B gene, thus ACVIII expression should be directed by the recombinant virus. Plaques were purified from the transfection stock after serial dilution in HEK 293 cells and overlaying with Noble agar-containing medium and serum. Plates were stained with neutral red and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-pyranogalactoside 7 days after infection, and clear plaques were picked on day 8. Plaques were grown in HEK 293 cells and tested for the presence of the ACVIII gene by polymerase chain reaction. A positive clone was grown in large stock, purified by banding consecutively on CsCl step and isopycnic gradients as indicated above, and dialyzed versus three changes of 1 liter each of 135 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH. 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50% (v/v) glycerol at 4 °C. The virus particle concentration was determined by reading absorbance at 260 nm, with 1 A260 unit considered equivalent to 1012 particles. The particle:plaque-forming unit ratio was approximately 100:1 for all preparations. Rat anterior pituitary GH4C1 cells were maintained in 13 ml of Ham's F-10 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 15% (v/v) horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Gemini) in 75-cm2 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. 4 × 106 cells were plated on 100-mm culture dishes for infection with the ACVIII construct. 48 h after infection, cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.03% EDTA and used immediately for measurement of cAMP accumulation or [Ca2+]i. The expression of ACVIII was optimized by varying the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). GH4C1 cells were infected with m.o.i.s ranging from 0 to 200 and assayed for their ability to be stimulated by Ca2+. After activation of VGCCs, a m.o.i. of 100 and 200 resulted in a robust Ca2+ stimulation of the cyclase of approximately 4- and 5-fold respectively. A m.o.i. of 100 was selected for further experiments to conserve virus stocks. cAMP accumulation in intact cells was measured according to the method of Evans et al. (25Evans T. Smith M.M. Tanner L.I. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (26Fagan K.A. Rich T.C. Tolman S. Schaack J. Karpen J.W. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12445-12453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with some modifications. GH4C1 cells on 100-mm culture dishes were incubated in Ham's F-10 medium (90 min at 37 °C) containing [2-3H]adenine (20.0 μCi/dish) to label the ATP pool. The cells were washed once and detached using phosphate-buffered saline containing EDTA (0.03%). The cells were then resuspended in a nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.75 mm KCl, 1.44 mmMgSO4, 11 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V) adjusted to pH 7.4 with 2m Tris base. The resuspended cells were aliquoted (approximately 3 × 105 cells/tube) and used for cAMP determination in triplicate assays. Experiments were carried out at 30 °C in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 100 μm), which was preincubated with the cells for 10 min before a 1-min assay. Unless indicated otherwise, forskolin (10 μm) was included in each assay to increase the cAMP signal. Assays were terminated by the addition of 10% (w/v, final concentration) trichloroacetic acid. The [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP content of the supernatants was quantified according to the standard Dowex/alumina methodology (27Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar) as described previously (26Fagan K.A. Rich T.C. Tolman S. Schaack J. Karpen J.W. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12445-12453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Accumulation of cAMP is expressed as the percentage of conversion of [3H]ATP into [3H]cAMP; means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations are indicated. GH4C1 cells (10 × 106/ml) were loaded with Fura-2/AM (2 μm) plus 0.02% pluronic acid in Ham's F-10 media (serum-free media containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with the same media and resuspended at a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots (400 μl; 4 × 106cells) were pelleted, resuspended in nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer, and used for [Ca2+]i measurements in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorometer. No differences were seen in [Ca2+]i-traces from infected and uninfected cells. Cell pretreatment with EGTA (0.1 mm) is referred to as the Ca2+-free condition. The 340/380 nm emission ratios were converted to [Ca2+] using the standard formula (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The functional expression of ACVIII was determined by biochemical assay. Because adenylyl cyclase type II, a Ca2+-insensitive isoform, is the predominant mRNA in GH4C1cells (29Paulssen R.H. Johansen P.W. Gordeladze J.O. Nymoen O. Paulssen E.J. Gautvik K.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the expression of ACVIII activity could be demonstrated conclusively by an increase in cAMP accumulation in response to an elevation in [Ca2+]i. The most robust means of elevating [Ca2+]i in GH4C1 cells is via VGCCs (30Mollard P. Theler J.M. Guerineau N. Vacher P. Chiavaroli C. Schlegel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25158-25164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, VGCCs were activated by membrane depolarization by increasing [K+]o in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o). When assayed with forskolin, control cells showed no response to VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry, whereas ACVIII-infected cells exhibited a robust stimulation in cAMP accumulation upon Ca2+ entry, yielding an approximately 3.5-fold stimulation compared with the Ca2+-free condition (Fig. 1 A). Vasoactive intestinal peptide stimulation of the cyclase via αsactivation could also be augmented approximately 2.5-fold by VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the use of an adenovirus construct to express ACVIII provided a simple and efficient means of heterologously expressing this protein in this excitable cell type. Little is known about the regulation of adenylyl cyclases by VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry in excitable cells. In nonexcitable cells, we have previously established that Ca2+ stimulation of heterologously expressed ACVIII occurs exclusively via CCE. Therefore, we wanted to characterize more fully the ability of VGCCs to regulate ACVIII expressed heterologously in an excitable cell. The activity of VGCCs relies on the membrane potential, which is dictated, in part, by the K+ concentration in the medium bathing the cells. The amount of Ca2+ entry after membrane depolarization with varying [K+]o was assessed (Fig. 2 A). Populations of Fura-2-loaded GH4C1 cells were maintained in Ca2+-free Krebs buffer (which contains 4.75 mm KCl). At 300 s, the [K+]o was increased by the addition of KCl (0–20 mm) and CaCl2 (2 mm), which resulted in a rapid, robust [Ca2+]i rise. The magnitude of the peak [Ca2+]i rise ranged from approximately 230 nm to approximately 1050 nm,depending on the [K+]o. The apparently equivalent [Ca2+]i rise elicited by 10 and 20 mmKCl indicates maximal stimulation of the VGCCs by modest membrane depolarization (indeed, addition of 40 mm KCl resulted in a [Ca2+]i rise identical to that elicited by 20 mm KCl; data not shown). The ability of the progressive [Ca2+]i rises triggered by incremental [K+]o increases to regulate the exogenously expressed ACVIII was next examined. GH4C1 cells infected with the ACVIII virus were incubated in Ca2+-free Krebs buffer. cAMP accumulation was measured over a 1-min period starting with the addition of forskolin and varying [KCl]o and [Ca2+]o as indicated (Fig. 2 B). In the absence of [Ca2+]o, there was no effect of membrane depolarization on cAMP accumulation. Inclusion of [Ca2+]o (2 mm) increased cAMP production at all [K+]o values, with an approximately 2-fold stimulation in the 5 mm[K+]o condition and an approximately 2.8-fold stimulation for the 10 and 20 mm[K+]o conditions. Thus, the observed “plateau” in the ability of high [K+]o to stimulate further Ca2+ entry was reflected in the regulation of ACVIII. Note that the cAMP accumulation is measured over the first minute after the addition of [Ca2+]o, where the [Ca2+]i rises triggered by 10 and 20 mm [K+]o are very similar (cf. Fig. 2 A). The above-mentioned findings showed that a Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclase could be regulated by Ca2+ entry through VGCCs in excitable cells. Furthermore, the magnitude of the stimulation mirrored the extent of Ca2+ entry. We have seen similar results with CCE in nonexcitable cells. In excitable cells, the role of CCE has been explored only sparingly in the face of the much more pronounced [Ca2+]i rise generated by VGCCs. However, we wondered whether CCE was present in excitable cells, if it could also regulate ACVIII, and how this might compare with the regulation by VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry. CCE is activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores using the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) (31Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with TG resulted in a modest [Ca2+]i rise (approximately 130 nm) that returned toward baseline because the cells were in Ca2+-free media (Fig. 3 A). Addition of [Ca2+]o, either 0.5 or 2 mm, resulted in a rapid [Ca2+]i rise that reached a peak of approximately 230 or 380 nm, respectively, within the time course of the cAMP measurements. Although the [Ca2+]i rise due to CCE was rather robust, it was considerably smaller than the [Ca2+]i rise generated by VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry (Fig. 3 B). Depolarization of the cells with KCl (10 mm) in the presence of either 0.5 or 2 mm[Ca2+]o resulted in peak [Ca2+]i rises of approximately 400 and 550 nm, respectively. Therefore, triggering of CCE by intracellular Ca2+ store depletion resulted in a modest [Ca2+]i rise compared with that arising from VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry. Next, the ability of CCE and VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry to stimulate ACVIII was compared. Cells maintained in Ca2+-free Krebs buffer were treated with TG 4 min before the addition of varying [Ca2+]o (Fig. 3 C). The stimulation of ACVIII (approximately 3.5-fold) by CCE was apparent at low [Ca2+]o (0.5 mm). Addition of higher [Ca2+]o (2 mm) resulted in further stimulation of ACVIII (approximately 5.2-fold). Comparing the ability of CCE and VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry to regulate ACVIII, it was apparent that at higher [Ca2+]o, they were very similar, with a slight difference observed at lower [Ca2+]o. The ability of CCE and VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry to stimulate ACVIII similarly is somewhat surprising in the light of the more robust Ca2+ entry arising from VGCCs (cf. Fig. 3, A andB). The clear demonstration of CCE in GH4C1 cells can be difficult because individual GH4C1 cells demonstrate spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations due to intermittent activation of VGCCs, even in “resting” conditions (10Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, in a population of GH4C1cells, considerable VGCC activity may underlie the magnitude of the Ca2+ entry ascribed to CCE. The extent of VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry in resting conditions was explored by comparing Ca2+ entry in untreated and TG-treated cells. Untreated cells reveal Ca2+ entry due to spontaneously active VGCCs along with CCE from passive store depletion due to the cells being in Ca2+-free buffer. The l-type VGCC blocker, nimodipine, can then be used to verify the contribution of the predominant l-type VGCC occurring in GH4C1 cells. Populations of Fura-2 loaded GH4C1 cells were either untreated or treated with TG 4 min before the addition of [Ca2+]o (2 mm). Prior treatment of the cells with TG may have augmented the [Ca2+]irise, giving a peak [Ca2+]i rise of approximately 250 nm (Fig. 4 A,trace a), compared with a peak [Ca2+]i rise of approximately 220 nm(Fig. 4 A, trace b) in the untreated cells (to illustrate the two traces more clearly, a running average (5-s intervals) of each trace has been overlaid on the actual trace). The magnitude of the [Ca2+]i rise generated by CCE was clearly discerned in the presence of the VGCC blocker nimodipine. Addition of nimodipine (1 μm) along with [Ca2+]o resulted in a greatly reduced [Ca2+]i rise in the untreated cells (approximately 125 nm as compared with 220 nmwithout nimodipine (Fig. 4 A, cf. b versus d)). The effect of nimodipine on TG-treated cells was much less drastic, decreasing the peak [Ca2+]i rise from 250 nm without nimodipine to 180 nm in the presence of the VGCC blocker (Fig. 4 A, cf. a versus c). The ability of nimodipine to greatly attenuate the [Ca2+]i rise generated by Ca2+addition alone illustrated the prominent, spontaneous VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry occurring in these cells. Accordingly, stimulation of ACVIII by the above-mentioned conditions also revealed the presence of spontaneous VGCC activity. Addition of [Ca2+]o to GH4C1 cells maintained in Ca2+-free Krebs buffer resulted in an approximately 1.5-fold stimulation of ACVIII as compared with the control, Ca2+-free condition (Fig. 4 A,inset, open bar versus right-hatched bar). Pretreatment of the cells with TG increased the amount of ACVIII stimulation, resulting in a 2.4-fold increase in activity (Fig. 4, inset, cross-hatched bar). In the presence of the VGCC blocker nimodipine, the ability of [Ca2+]o addition alone to stimulate the cyclase was completely abolished (Fig. 4 A, inset,left-hatched bar), whereas cells pretreated with TG still showed a robust regulation of ACVIII (approximately 1.9-fold stimulation; Fig. 4 A, inset, horizontal striped bar). Thus, basal VGCC activity in resting cells did contribute significantly to the stimulation of ACVIII. Conversely, there was no indication of CCE in resting, untreated cells, because the Ca2+ entry generated by Ca2+ addition was completely blocked by nimodipine. Another method to verify the presence of CCE is to determine whether the combination of the two Ca2+ entry mechanisms (CCE and VGCC) yields augmented [Ca2+]i rises and/or regulation of ACVIII. Populations of GH4C1cells were treated with TG (Fig. 4 B, traces a and c), followed by depolarization with KCl (10 mm; traces a and b) and addition of [Ca2+]o (0.5 mm; note that lower [Ca2+]o values were used to prevent maximal Ca2+ entry with depolarization alone). TG treatment alone (trace c) resulted in a modest [Ca2+]irise of approximately 250 nm after the addition of [Ca2+]o. Activation of VGCCs with the addition of [K+]o along with [Ca2+]oresulted in a [Ca2+]i rise of approximately 400 nm (trace b). Combining the two (TG and [K+]o (trace a)) resulted in an augmented [Ca2+]i rise of approximately 510 nm. The combination of CCE and VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry also resulted in increased regulation of ACVIII (Fig. 4 B, inset). GH4C1cells that were pretreated with TG before [Ca2+]oaddition showed a stimulation of ACVIII by approximately 2.4-fold as compared with control, untreated cells (Fig. 4 B,inset, open bar versus right-hatched bar). Depolarization of the cells by the addition of [K+]o along with [Ca2+]oalso resulted in a stimulation of the cyclase, giving an approximately 2.2-fold increase (Fig. 4 B, inset,cross-hatched bar). Combination of the two modes of Ca2+ entry resulted in an augmented regulation of ACVIII, yielding an approximately 2.8-fold stimulation (Fig. 4 B,inset, left-hatched bar). In the same experiment as Fig. 4 B, the ability of VGCC-mediated Ca2+entry activated by KCl addition to regulate the cyclase was also blocked by nimodipine (Fig. 4 C). Furthermore, treatment of"

Presently, we found, in rat adipocytes, 3T3/L1 fibroblasts, L6 myotubes, and several other cell types, that glucose activates ERK independently of both glucose metabolism and PKC activation but dependent upon the activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, proline-rich tyrosine kinase (PYK2). We also found that the Glut1 glucose transporter, apparently through specific amino acid residues in its C terminus, binds PYK2 and amplifies ERK activation by glucose. As described (4Ishizuka T.

After overnight (rat adipocytes) or 48 h (3T3/L1 cells) of incubation to allow time for expression, cells were washed and incubated, in most cases for 10 min, in glucose-free KRP medium, without or with addition of glucose, insulin or TPA, as described in the text. After incubation, HA-ERK2 or Myc-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Covance) or rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antiserum or mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (Upstate Biotechnologies Inc.) and assayed for myelin basic protein phosphorylation, as described above. In some experiments, plasma membrane levels of HA-tagged or Myc-tagged glucose transporters were quantified by measuring the cell surface content of HA or Myc epitopes, using anti-HA or anti-Myc mouse monoclonal primary antibodies (Covance or Upstate Biotechnologies Inc.) and 125I-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IGG second antibody, as described (21Standaert M.L.

In some experiments, Myc-Glut1 was immunoprecipitated and examined for associated immunoreactive PYK2. Mutant forms of Myc-tagged Glut1 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a Gene Editor kit from Promega and the following primers: S465A mutation, 5′-CCTGCCGGAAGCCGGCCGCGATCTCATCGAAG-OH-3′, which includes a CGGCCG BstZ-1 site; A464S/S465A/G466A mutation, 5′-GCACCCCCCTGCCGGAAGGCTGCAGAGATCTCATCGAAGGTTCG-OH-3′, which includes a GAGATCT Bgl-II site; and R468G mutation, 5′-GCTGGCACCCCCCTGGCCAAAGCCGGAAGCGATC-OH-3′, which includes a TGGCCABalI site. These mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. In initial studies, we found that rat adipocytes were damaged (i.e. leaky with respect to glucose transport) by adenoviral infection and were considered to be unsuitable for use in the present study. We therefore used 3T3/L1 fibroblasts, because they have only Glut1 glucose transporters, are not damaged significantly by adenoviral infection, and are highly responsive to glucose and other saccharides in terms of increasing ERK activity independently of PKC and subsequent metabolism (see below). Fully confluent 3T3/L1 fibroblasts were infected with adenovirus alone or adenovirus encoding Glut1, Glut2, or chimeras in which their C termini were transposed, viz.N(1–457)Glut1/C(490–525)Glut2 and N(1–489)Glut2/C(458–492)Glut1; as described previously (30Noel L.E. Newgard C.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5465-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each of these viral constructs encode glucose transporters that are functional with respect to hexose transport (see Ref. 30Noel L.E. Newgard C.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5465-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; also documented presently, see below). After 48 h to allow time for expression, cells were placed into serum-free DMEM for 3 h, then equilibrated in glucose-free KRP medium for 20 min, and subsequently treated for10 min with or without 20 mm glucose. After incubation, cell lysates were examined for total immunoprecipitable ERK activity. Cellular uptake of3H-labeled d-glucose over 10 min was also monitored to compare the effects of expressed glucose transporters on cytochalasin B-inhibitable glucose uptake to effects on ERK. Glucose, over a range of 2.5–30 mm, provoked rapid progressive increases in immunoprecipitable ERK activity (Fig. 1, A and B). Effects of 10 and 20 mm glucose on ERK activity were comparable and nonadditive to those of submaximal and maximally effective insulin (Fig. 1, A and B). The latter was surprising, because glucose uptake in rat adipocytes, which increases steadily over the concentration range of 2.5–20 mm in the absence of insulin (19Hoffman J.M. Ishizuka T. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2937-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), is increased further by insulin uptake throughout this glucose concentration range (19Hoffman J.M. Ishizuka T. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2937-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Figure 1Effects of glucose, insulin, and various saccharides on immunoprecipitable ERK activity in rat adipocytes.Adipocytes were equilibrated in glucose-free KRP medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and then treated with or without 20 mmd-glucose alone (GLU,closed circles), 20 mm mannitol alone (MAN, open circles), 10 nm insulin (INS) plus 20 mm mannitol (closed squares), or 20 mmd-glucose plus 10 nm insulin (open triangles) for indicated times in A or with indicated concentrations of glucose (GLU, closed circles) or mannitol (MAN, open circles) for 10 min in B, or for 10 min with indicated concentrations of glucose, mannitol and insulin in C, or for 10 min with indicated concentrations ofd-glucose, 2-DOG, 3OMG, d-mannose, glucosamine (GLU-NH2), mannitol, and l-glucose inD. Note that osmolality was kept constant in all groups inA and C. After incubation, immunoprecipitable ERK activity was measured. Values are the means ± S.E. of four determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The failure of insulin to augment glucose effects suggested that the uptake and intracellular metabolism of glucose may not be the major determinant for ERK activation. Interestingly, transported, but nonmetabolizable sugars, 3-O-methyl-glucose (3OMG), which is not phosphorylated, and 2-DOG, which is converted only to glucose-6-PO4, were as effective as glucose in activating ERK (Fig. 1 D). Also, both mannose, which is transported and metabolized like glucose, and glucosamine, which is transported similarly to but metabolized differently from glucose (i.e.is primarily used to synthesize glycolated products (31McClain D.A. Crook E.D. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), activated immunoprecipitable ERK as potently as glucose (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, l-glucose and mannitol had little or no effect on ERK activity (Fig. 1, B and D). Thus, glucose-stimulated ERK activation was not due to changes in medium osmolality and required specific structural features. The ability of each of these carbohydrates to activate ERK was paralleled by their ability to inhibit 2-DOG uptake (not shown), through isotopic dilution or competitive interaction at the level of the glucose transporter (see below). Glucose effects on ERK, unlike those of phorbol esters, were not influenced by PKC inhibitors, GF109203X and GO6976 (Fig. 2 A), or by down-regulation of DAG-sensitive PKCs by prolonged phorbol ester treatment (Fig. 2 B). Also, glucose effects on ERK, unlike those of insulin, were not inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (Fig. 2 A), or expression of kinase-inactive PKC-ζ (Fig. 3D), both of which inhibit insulin-induced activation of ERK2 in rat adipocytes (Figs. 2 and 3 and Ref. 25Sajan M.P.

On the other hand, glucose effects on ERK, like those of insulin (25Sajan M.P. Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Quon M.J. Burke Jr., T.R. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30495-30500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), were inhibited by: (a) the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (Fig. 2 A); (b) a GRB2-SH2 domain inhibitor (Fig. 2 A); (c) dominant-negative forms of GRB2, SOS, RAS and c-RAF-1 (Fig. 3, A–C); and (d) the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059 (Fig. 2 A). As with glucose, effects of 3OMG and 2DOG on ERK were independent of PKC in rat adipocytes (not shown).Figure 3Effects of expression of wild-type (WT) or dominant-negative (DN) forms of GRB2 (A), SOS (B), RAS or RAF (C), or kinase-inactive (KI) PKC -ζ (D) on glucose-, insulin-, or phorbol ester-induced activation of epitope-tagged ERK2 in rat adipocytes. Adipocytes were co-transfected with plasmids encoding epitope-tagged ERK2 and indicated signaling proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After overnight incubation to allow time for expression, cells were washed and incubated for 10 min in glucose-free KRP medium without (C) or with 20 mm glucose (G), 10 nminsulin (I), or 1 μm tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (T). After incubation, HA- or Myc- tagged ERK2 was immunoprecipitated and assayed. Values are the means ± S.E. of four determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The activation of ERK by transported sugars, glucose, mannose, glucosamine, 3OMG, and 2-DOG, suggested that one or more glucose transporters is required for ERK activation. Accordingly, cytochalasin B, which binds to Glut1 and Glut4 glucose transporters and noncompetitively blocks the binding and subsequent uptake of glucose and other saccharides (32Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Karnieli E. Zarnowski M.J. Hissin P.J. Simpson I.A. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. J. Biol.

Methodol. 1988; 12B: 171-187Google Scholar), inhibited both ERK activation by glucose (Fig. 2 C) and other sugars (see below), and cellular uptake of 3H-labeled d-glucose (Fig. 2 D). Half-maximal and maximal inhibitory effects of cytochalasin B on both processes were observed at approximately 1 and 30–100 μm, respectively. Note that (a) 20 mm glucose was used in experiments shown in Fig. 2(C and D) and (b) the same concentrations of cytochalasin B were required to inhibit the uptake of 20 mm glucose (Fig. 2 D) and 50 μm3H-labeled 2-DOG (not shown). Thus, assuming that glucose uptake is dependent on binding to glucose transporters, theKd values for binding of cytochalasin B and glucose to glucose transporters (see below and Fig. 7) are markedly different. Also note that cytochalasin B did not inhibit insulin-induced ERK activation (Fig. 2 C). Overexpression of increasing amounts of the Glut1 glucose transporter (Fig. 4 D) led to progressive increases in (a) plasma membrane levels of such expressed (epitope-tagged) Glut1 (Fig. 4 C), and (b) glucose-induced (Fig. 4 A), but not phorbol ester-induced (not shown), activation of Myc-ERK2. In contrast, overexpression of the Glut4 glucose transporter inhibited glucose-dependent Myc-ERK2 activation (Figs. 4 B, 5 C, and6 A), even when insulin was added to increase plasma membrane Glut4 content and subsequent glucose transport (Fig. 5 C). Thus, because Glut4 expression and insulin treatment did not amplify glucose effects on ERK and because plasma membrane levels of epitope-tagged Glut1 and Glut4 were similar (not shown), simple changes in glucose uptake did not account for observed effects of glucose transporters on ERK. (Note that Glut4 translocation in transfected cells is increased only 2–3-fold by insulin, as compared with 5–10-fold increases in 2-DOG uptake observed in freshly incubated rat adipocytes. As discussed (21Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol.

In non-excitable cells, a variety of extracellular stimuli mediate changes in cytosolic [Ca2+] through the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores (3Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). This is achieved through the concerted activation of a family of related intracellular Ca2+channels/receptor complexes for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)1 (4Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 5Taylor C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and ryanodine (6Sorrentino V. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 33: 67-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The latter are thought to be activated and/or modulated by cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) (7Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 8Galione A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 98: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores activates Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space that serves to refill them, thereby sustaining the Ca2+ signal (9Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Conversely, in excitable cells such as neurons, Ca2+ increases are mediated primarily through voltage- and ligand-gated Ca2+ channels located on the plasma membrane. However, accumulating evidence also implicates a role for intracellular Ca2+ stores in neuronal Ca2+homeostasis (10Miller R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1991; 37: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 11Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Thus, in all cells, interplay between mobilization of stored Ca2+ and Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane is likely important in shaping cytosolic Ca2+ signals. Recently, a novel Ca2+-mobilizing messenger, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) has been described in sea urchin eggs (7Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), which, based on cross-desensitization experiments (12Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and distinct pharmacology (13Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), is thought to release Ca2+ independently of IP3 or ryanodine receptor activation. NAADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization in the sea urchin egg is unique in several respects. First, sub-threshold concentrations of NAADP completely desensitize homogenates to subsequent challenge with maximal concentrations of NAADP that normally evoke full Ca2+ release (13Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Secondly, NAADP releases Ca2+ from a pool distinct from that mobilized by IP3 and cADPR (12Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 15Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 315: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and finally, NAADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization is not regulated by Ca2+ (16Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,17Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), a property that underlies regenerative Ca2+ release via IP3 and ryanodine receptors (1Berridge M.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 315-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Thomas A.P. Bird G. St J. Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). A binding site for NAADP has been previously demonstrated in sea urchin egg microsomes (14Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); however, little is known concerning the molecular identity or distribution of putative NAADP receptors. The actions of NAADP have now been extended to mammalian (18Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 19Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and plant (20Navazio L. Bewell M.A. Siddiqua A. Dickinson G.D. Galione A. Sanders D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8693-8698Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) preparations. In acinar cells of the pancreas, NAADP is thought to underlie complex Ca2+ signals in response to the brain-gut peptide, cholecystokinin, by providing a “trigger” Ca2+ release that is subsequently propagated by ryanodine and IP3 receptors (18Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 21Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). NAADP can also mobilize Ca2+ from crude brain microsomes (19Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that NAADP signaling, like the phosphoinositide pathway (10Miller R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1991; 37: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 11Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar), may be active in the brain. Indeed, NAADP metabolism has been characterized in brain preparations (19Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here we have characterized binding sites for [32P]NAADP in the brain. This is the first report of NAADP binding sites in a mammalian tissue. Our data support a general role for NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signaling in the brain. [32P]NAADP synthesis described here is a variation of the procedure reported previously (14Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). [32P]NADP was synthesized from [32P]NAD (2 μm; specific activity 1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubation with NAD kinase (50 units/ml; Sigma) and 10 mm MgATP for 2 h at 37 °C in a buffer containing 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). The remaining ATP and ADP was converted to AMP by incubation with apyrase (2 units/ml; Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was then diluted 5-fold into a medium containing 10 mm MES (pH 5.0), 19 mm nicotinic acid, and ADP-ribosyl cyclase (2 μg/ml; Sigma) and incubated for another 2 h to convert [32P]NADP to [32P]NAADP by base exchange. The final mixture was separated by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography on a 3 × 150-mm column packed with AGMP1 (Bio-Rad). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a gradient of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) that increased linearly from 0–2% over the first 6 min, to 4% at 11 min, to 8% at 16 min, to 16% at 21 min, to 32% at 26 min, and to 100% (150 mmTFA) at 26.1 min. Fractions were collected every minute and neutralized by the addition of Tris base (final concentration 75 mm), and their radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting. A major peak was observed at 25.6 ± 0.4 min (n = 3) that corresponded to authentic NAADP (determined by monitoring absorbance at 254 nm) run on a parallel AGMP1 column (elution time 25.1 ± 0.2 min). Whole brains from male CD1 mice or Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized at 4 °C using an UltraTurax homogenizer in binding medium composed of 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.2) and 1 mm EDTA supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Membranes were washed twice by centrifugation (10 min; 20,000 × g) and stored at −20 °C until use. Collection of sea urchin (Lytechinus pictus) eggs and preparation of homogenates were performed as described previously (13Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Binding of [32P]NAADP (∼1 nm) to brain membranes (∼500 μg/incubation) was performed in binding medium composed of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C. No significant degradation of NAADP (up to 1.5 h) could be detected under these experimental conditions. Binding of [32P]NAADP (∼0.2 nm) to sea urchin homogenates (0.5% v/v; ∼40 μg/incubation) was determined at 20 °C in a medium composed of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 250 mm potassium gluconate, 250 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, and 1 mmMgCl2. Bound and free radioligand were separated by rapid filtration. Similar results were obtained with both mouse and rat brain tissue (data not shown). Male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (340–360 g) were killed by cervical dislocation, and brains were rapidly removed, frozen in isopentane, and stored at −70 °C prior to sectioning. Cryostat sections (12 μm) were thaw-mounted on to gelatin-coated slides and returned to −70 °C for storage. Binding of [32P]NAADP (1–2 nm) to the sections was performed for 2 h at 20 °C in a medium composed of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and 1 mm EDTA. Equilibrated samples were then washed with HEPES buffer at 4 °C (10 mm; pH 7.2), air dried, and apposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 12–24 h at −80 °C. Autoradiograms were analyzed using Scion Image (Scion Corporation, Fredrick, MD). Nonspecific binding of [32P]NAADP (determined in the presence of 100 μm unlabeled NAADP) to sections cut at the level of the frontal cortex (see Fig. 3 A) and thalamus (data not shown) was virtually undetectable. 2′,3′-Cyclic NAADP and 3′-NAADP were synthesized and purified as described (23Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20378-20383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Protein was determined using bicinchoninic acid (Sigma). Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean. Enzymatically prepared [32P]NAADP bound to crude membrane preparations from brain (Fig.1). Association of [32P]NAADP followed monophasic kinetics with a first order association rate constant (k+1) of 9.4 ± 1 × 107m−1 min−1(n = 3; see Fig. 1 A). Binding of [32P]NAADP was specific for NAADP, because a 100,000-fold molar excess of the related nucleotides, NAD, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD), and cADPR did not displace [32P]NAADP (Fig. 1 B). Binding of [32P]NAADP was also insensitive to IP3 (20 μm) (Fig. 1 B). These data indicate that [32P]NAADP binds to a unique site distinct from that of known Ca2+-mobilizing messengers. Apparent (partial) displacement of the radioligand was observed with NADP (100 μm). This effect, however, is likely to be due to NAADP contamination in commercial NADP preparations (14Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). From competitive equilibrium displacement analysis (Fig.2), the concentration of NAADP causing half-maximal displacement of the radioligand (IC50) from brain membranes was 200 ± 17 nm (n = 11). In contrast, the IC50 for sea urchin egg homogenates was 0.47 ± 0.06 nm (n = 12). Differences were also observed in the Hill coefficient (n H) for binding in the two tissues;n H was 0.76 ± 0.04 (n = 11) and 1.05 ± 0.02 (n = 12) in brain and sea urchin eggs, respectively. Thus, [32P]NAADP likely binds to a single site in the egg preparations (probably the inactivation site; see below), whereas in the brain, multiple binding sites for [32P]NAADP may exist. [32P]NAADP binding to sea urchin egg microsomes has been reported to be essentially irreversible (14Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in the present studies using crude homogenates (data not shown). This unusual property is likely to underlie the remarkable inactivation properties of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release in these cells (13Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In stark contrast, however, [32P]NAADP binding to brain membranes was completely reversible (Fig. 1 C). Thus, an excess of unlabeled NAADP (100 μm) initiated dissociation of bound [32P]NAADP with a first order dissociation rate constant (k−1) of 0.07 ± 0.008 min−1 (n = 3). The clear differences in the reversibility of NAADP binding in the brain and sea urchin egg likely explains the ∼1000-fold difference in apparent affinity for NAADP (Fig. 2). We next examined the effects of the NAADP analogues, 2′,3′-cyclic NAADP and 3′-NAADP (23Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20378-20383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), on [32P]NAADP binding. Both the analogues fully displaced [32P]NAADP but were less potent than NAADP (Fig. 2). The observed rank order of potency (NAADP > 2′,3′-cyclic NAADP > 3′-NAADP) was the same in brain membranes and sea urchin egg homogenates (Fig. 2). IC50 values for NAADP, 2′,3′-cyclic NAADP, and 3′-NAADP were 240 ± 40 nm, 531 ± 26 nm, and 2518 ± 104 nm (n = 3), respectively, for brain membranes. The corresponding values for sea urchin egg homogenates were 0.18 ± 0.008 nm, 0.64 ± 0.03 nm,and 1.3 ± 0.35 nm (n = 3). Additionally, the reported rank order of potency of NAADP and the analogues in stimulating Ca2+ release from sea urchin egg homogenates is also identical (23Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20378-20383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that [32P]NAADP binds to physiologically relevant receptors linked to NAADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization (19Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Autoradiographic analysis revealed that NAADP binding sites were distributed throughout the brain (Fig.3). Strikingly, the localization of [32P]NAADP binding sites was far from homogeneous. Binding of [32P]NAADP was particularly high in the medulla (Fig. 3 H), midbrain (Fig. 3 G), and thalamus (Fig. 3 E). Individually, these areas are known to be involved in a diverse range of functions and collectively, contain pathways involved in the processing of somatosensory information. Appreciable levels of binding were also detected in anterior cortical regions and globus pallidus (Fig. 3 D). In contrast to inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptor distribution (24Sharp A.H. McPherson P.S. Dawson T.M. Campbell K.P. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3051-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NAADP binding was low in the striatum (Fig. 3 C) and hippocampus (Fig. 3 F). Furthermore, [32P]NAADP binding levels in the cerebellum were moderate (Fig. 3 H), whereas this region is particularly enriched in the other intracellular Ca2+ release channels (24Sharp A.H. McPherson P.S. Dawson T.M. Campbell K.P. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3051-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, [32P]NAADP binding was apparent in both gray and white matter (e.g. corpus callosum; see Fig. 3 C), possibly indicating the presence of the binding sites in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Whether the observed regional differences in [32P]NAADP binding sites results from differences in expression levels and/or affinity of NAADP receptors remains to be established. Nevertheless, our data point to possible functional heterogeneity in NAADP signaling within the brain. This study is the first to demonstrate specific binding sites for NAADP in a mammalian tissue. Remarkably, whereas the NAADP analogue specificity was similar in brain and sea urchin eggs, the reversibility of binding between the two systems was in stark contrast. These data indicate differential regulation and/or the existence of multiple NAADP receptor subtypes. Indeed, the apparent affinity for NAADP (and the analogues) were markedly different in brain and egg preparations, and displacement curves in the brain were somewhat shallow. Furthermore, we have demonstrated intriguing heterogeneity in the distribution of NAADP binding sites within the brain and found key differences between the localization of these sites and that of known intracellular Ca2+ release channels. The present data, together with our recent demonstration of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release from brain microsomes (19Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the ability of brain homogenates to both synthesize and degrade NAADP (19Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), strongly support a signaling role for NAADP in the brain.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), particularly its BB isoform, has been identified as the most potent mitogen for HSC. 4-Hydroxy-2,3-nonenal and related 4-hydroxy-2,3-alkenals (HAKs) have been suggested to modulate the process of HSC activation. In this study we investigated the relationship between HAKs and PDGF receptor activation in human HSC. By employing noncytotoxic concentrations (10−6m) of HAKs, we observed a significant inhibition of PDGF-BB-dependent DNA synthesis. HAKs inhibited relevant pathways of PDGF-BB-dependent mitogenic signaling, including autophosphorylation of PDGF receptor (PDGF-R) β subunits and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and extracellular regulated kinases 1/2. Inhibition of DNA synthesis was reversible, and recovery of PDGF-mediated mitogenic signaling occurred within 24–48 h and was associated with HAKs-induced up-regulation of PDGF-R β gene expression. 4-Hydroxy-2,3-nonenal, used as a model HAK, inhibited the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity associated with the PDGF-R β subunit, whereas binding of PDGF to its receptor was unaffected.

In these clinical settings one of the most relevant effect of PDGF is the stimulation of proliferation of target cells of mesenchymal origin. In the liver, hepatic stellate cells are major effector cells involved in the development and progression of liver fibrosis and are particularly responsive to PDGF (5Friedman SL. N. Engl. J.

In addition, overexpression of PDGF isoforms and their cognate receptors has been shown during active fibrogenesis in human liver (12Pinzani M. Milani S. Herbst H. De Franco R. Grappone C.

Several downstream signal transduction molecules have been shown to bind to different autophosphorylation sites in PDGF-R, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K), phospholipase C-γ, the Src family of tyrosine kinases, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, GTPase-activating protein for Ras, as well as other adaptor molecules (14Heldin C.H.

In addition, a major role has been demonstrated for Ras activation, which is followed by a kinase cascade including Raf-1, MEK, and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) (14Heldin C.H.

We have investigated whether HNE and other HAKs may be able to affect PDGF mitogenic signaling in cultured HSC, as a paradigm of mesenchymal cells involved in organ fibrosis. Following chronic liver tissue injury, HSC activate and transdifferentiate into highly proliferative myofibroblast-like cells that account for deposition of extracellular matrix leading to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis (5Friedman SL.

The results of the present study indicate that HAKs specifically block PDGF-dependent HSC DNA synthesis by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor and its downstream signaling when used at low, nontoxic concentrations. 4-Hydroxy-2,3-alkenals of different chain length, HNE, 4-hydroxy-2,3-octenal (HOE) and 4-hydroxy-2,3-undecenal (HUE), were kindly provided by Prof. Hermann Esterbauer (Dept. Biochemistry, University of Graz, Graz, Austria). The polyclonal antibodies recognizing PDGF-R β subunits and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10, used for Western blotting) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (used for immunoprecipitation) were from Oncogene Science (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against the EGF-R and c-Akt were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against the PDGF-R α subunit were from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Unless specifically indicated, all the other reagents were from Sigma. Human HSC were isolated from a wedge section of normal human liver tissue unsuitable for transplantation by collagenase-Pronase digestion and centrifugation on stractan gradiens. Procedures for cell isolation, culture, and characterization have been described extensively elsewhere (45Casini A. Pinzani M. Milani S. Grappone C. Galli G. Jezequel A.M. Schuppan D. Rotella C.M. Surrenti C. Gastroenterology. 1993; 10: 245-253Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 46Marra F. Valente A.J. Pinzani M. Abboud H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in complete medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. Data presented herein were obtained using three separate cell lines used between passages 4 and 7. As already reported (45Casini A. Pinzani M. Milani S. Grappone C. Galli G. Jezequel A.M. Schuppan D. Rotella C.M. Surrenti C. Gastroenterology. 1993; 10: 245-253Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar), at these stages of culture, human HSC showed transmission electron microscopy features of “myofibroblast-like cells,” thus indicating complete transition to their activated phenotype. In all the experiments employing HNE and other HAKs, HSC were incubated in serum-free/insulin-free (SFIF) medium for 24 h before the addition of these compounds. Unless otherwise stated, HAKs were always added to culture medium 15 min before the addition of PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml). Confluent HSC in 24-well dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in SFIF medium for 24 h. The cells were then incubated with HAKs for varying periods of time and then exposed to PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) for an additional 24 h; DNA synthesis was measured as the incorporation of [3H]thymidine, as described previously (47Pinzani M. Gesualdo L. Sabbah G.M. Abboud H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1786-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Confluent cells in 24-well dishes were incubated in SFIF for 24 h and then incubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of 1 μm HNE. The procedure for the binding assay was exactly as previously reported (48Pinzani M. Gentilini A. Caligiuri A. De Franco R. Pellegrini G. Milani S. Marra F. Gentilini P. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 232-239PubMed Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis of the binding data was performed using Ligand software. Confluent and 24 h serum-starved cells were treated with the appropriate conditions and then quickly placed on ice and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cell lysates were obtained as described previously (49Marra F. Gentilini A. Pinzani M. Choudhury G.G. Parola M. Herbst H. Dianzani M.U. Laffi G. Abboud H.E. Gentilini P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1297-1306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). HSC monolayers were lysed in immunoprecipitation assay buffer consisting in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, and 0.05% aprotinin (w/v). Insoluble proteins were discarded by high speed centrifugation at 4 °C. Protein concentration in the supernatant was measured in triplicate using a commercially available assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205428) Google Scholar) and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C extra; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C for unspecific binding using 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-Tween). The blots were incubated with appropriated primary antibodies, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (as secondary antibodies) in TBS-Tween containing 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Immunoblots were developed with the ECL plus reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech according to manufacturer's instructions. ERK activity was detected using myelin basic protein as substrate. Briefly, proteins from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-ERK antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After washing, immunobeads were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in reaction buffer consisting in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.4 mg of myelin basic protein. Reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer and then subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and autoradiographed; bands corresponding to myelin basic protein were identified and evaluated by laser densitometry. PI 3-K was measured as the recruitment of PI 3-K activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates, as described previously (49Marra F. Gentilini A. Pinzani M. Choudhury G.G. Parola M. Herbst H. Dianzani M.U. Laffi G. Abboud H.E. Gentilini P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1297-1306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins from different experimental conditions were immunoprecipitated using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. After washing, the immunobeads were resuspendend in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EGTA. One microliter of 20 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol was added, and the samples were then incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. One microliter of 1 mmMgCl2 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were then added simultaneously, and the incubation was continued for 10 more minutes. The reaction was stopped by addition of 150 μl of chloroform, methanol, 37% HCl (10:20:0.2). Samples were extracted with chloroform and dried. Radioactive lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography using chloroform, methanol, 30% ammonium hydroxide, water (46:41:5:8). After drying, the plates were autoradiographed. The radioactive spots were then scraped and counted in a β-counter. This assay was carried out essentially as described by Sandirasegarane et al. (50Sandirasegarane L. Charles R. Bourbon N. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C225-C235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One hundred micrograms of protein was immunoprecipitated using anti-Akt antibodies and protein G-agarose. The immunobeads were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The assay was performed resuspending the beads in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate) in the presence of 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 50 μm unlabeled ATP, and 6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, using exogenous histone H2B (1.5 μg/assay tube) as the substrate and incubating for 20 min at room temperature. The proteins in the samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and subjected to autoradiography. Cell lysates were obtained from serum-deprived HSC exposed to the following conditions: sample A, untreated cells; sample B, 1 μm HNE for 15 min; sample C, PDGF for 10 min; and sample D, HNE for 15 min followed by PDGF for 10 min. One aliquot of the samples B and D and two aliquots of samples A and C were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti PDGF-R β subunit antibodies (49Marra F. Gentilini A. Pinzani M. Choudhury G.G. Parola M. Herbst H. Dianzani M.U. Laffi G. Abboud H.E. Gentilini P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1297-1306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and finally resuspended in 50 mm Hepes at pH 7.4. At this point, 1 μm HNE was added to one aliquot of samples A and C for 15 min to establish the effects of HNE on purified PDGF-R β subunits in vitro. The other aliquots of samples A and C as well as samples B and D received no additions. At the end of this 15-min incubation, MnCl2 (final concentration, 10 mm) and [γ-32P]ATP (20 μCi) were added to all samples, which were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The beads were then washed once with immunoprecipitation assay buffer (see before) and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Total RNA from cultured HSC was isolated by the guanidine isothiocyanate-phenol-chlorophorm method (52Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62890) Google Scholar). Total RNA of the samples was calculated spectrophotometrically by the absorbance at 260 nm. Purity of RNA was determined from the 260/280 nm absorbance ratio. The level of PDGF-R β subunit mRNA was determined by the RNase protection assay that was performed essentially as extensively reported elsewhere (12Pinzani M. Milani S. Herbst H. De Franco R.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The previously described cDNA fragments encoding for human PDGF-R β subunit mRNA and subcloned in pGEM1 were employed in this assay. The gene product glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (a 110-base pair cDNA fragment subcloned in theHindIII site of pT7.2) was used as housekeeping gene. After the linearization of the plasmid with the restriction endonuclease T7, RNA polymerase (Promega) was used to run off antisense32P-labeled RNA probes. The newly synthesized RNA probes (specific activity, approximately 1 × 109 cpm/μg) were hybridized overnight to 10 μg of total RNA from individual samples at 55 °C. After hybridization, the reaction was treated with RNases A (50 μg/ml) and T1 (2 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature and for an additional 30 min at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 300 mm NaCl. Protected fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 7.0 murea, 6% acrylamide gel and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −80 °C for 72 h. HAKs were tested for cytotoxicity on confluent and 24 h serum-starved HSC. HSC cultured on 24-well plates were exposed to increasing concentrations of test molecules, and cytotoxicity was evaluated at the end of a 24-h incubation by means of trypan blue exclusion dye test. Data presented as bar graphs are the means (± S.E.) of three independent experiments. Autoradiograms and luminograms are representative of at least three experiments with similar results. Statistical analysis was performed by Student'st test (p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant). We tested HAKs of different chain length, namely HOE, HNE, and HUE, on basal and PDGF-dependent DNA synthesis. HAKs exerted a significant inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis of unstimulated cells when added at concentrations of 100 μm or higher, whereas lower doses (range 0.1–10 μm) had no effect (Fig. 1, A–C). In contrast, HAK concentrations as low as 1 μm, chosen because this low dose has been found to elicit other biological responses in HSC (33Parola M. Robino G. Marra F. Pinzani M. Bellomo G.

All three aldehydes had comparable effects on DNA synthesis (Fig. 1). We next investigated whether the observed effects of HAKs on DNA synthesis were related to a cytotoxic action. Cultured HSC were exposed to increasing concentrations of HAKs (HOE, HNE, and HUE) for 24 h, and cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion (TableI). Concentrations of HAKs in the 0.1–10 μm range were devoid of any cytotoxic effects (Table I), whereas exposure of HSC to concentrations of 100 μm or higher was associated with a marked reduction in cell viability (TableI). Again, no significant differences were observed in the cytotoxic action of the three different aldehydes. Therefore, although the reduction in basal [3H]thymidine incorporation by high doses of HAKs was likely to depend on a cytotoxic effect, the inhibition of PDGF-induced DNA synthesis observed at doses of 1 μm cannot be ascribed to this action (compare Table I and Fig. 1). On the basis of these results, we decided to concentrate our efforts to the understanding of the mechanisms of action of low dose HAKs on PDGF-mediated DNA synthesis.Table IAnalysis of cytotoxicity exerted by increasing doses of HAKs of different chain lengthConcentrationVIABLE CELLS (Percent of total)ControlHOEHNEHUENone97 ± 20.1 μm100 ± 396 ± 595 ± 41.0 μm98 ± 497 ± 495 ± 310 μm89 ± 593 ± 687 ± 5100 μm21 ± 9 1-ap < 0.01versus control values.16 ± 7 1-ap < 0.01versus control values.23 ± 6 1-ap < 0.01versus control values.1.0 mm3 ± 3 1-ap < 0.01versus control values.4 ± 2 1-ap < 0.01versus control values.6 ± 2 1-ap < 0.01versus control values.Cell viability was assayed by the Trypan blue dye exclusion test at the end of a 24-h incubation.

https://openalex.org/W2035709966,"PRELP (proline, arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein) is an extracellular matrix leucine-rich repeat protein. The amino-terminal region of PRELP differs from that of other leucine-rich repeat proteins in containing a high number of proline and arginine residues. The clustered proline and basic residues are conserved in rat, bovine, and human PRELP. Although the function of PRELP is not yet known, the clustered arginine residues suggest a heparan sulfate/heparin-binding capacity. We show here that PRELP indeed binds heparin and heparan sulfate. Truncated PRELP without the amino-terminal region does not bind heparin. The dissociation constant for the interaction of PRELP with heparin was determined by an in solution binding assay and by surface plasmon resonance analysis to be in the range of 10-30 nm. A 6-mer heparin oligosaccharide was the smallest size showing binding to PRELP. The binding increased with increasing length up to an 18-mer and depended on the degree of sulfation of heparin as well as heparan sulfate. Sulfate groups at all positions were shown to be of importance for the binding. Fibroblasts bind PRELP, and this interaction is inhibited with heparin, suggesting a function for PRELP as a linker between the matrix and cell surface proteoglycans."

The production of PGD2 in L9 cells, which overexpressed non-mitochondrial phospholipid glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), was only one-third that in the control line of cells (S1 cells). The reduction in the formation of PGD2 in L9 cells was reversed upon inhibition of PHGPx activity by buthionine sulfoximine. Experiments with inhibitors demonstrated that prostaglandin H synthase-2 (PGHS-2) was the isozyme responsible for the production of PGD2 upon cross-linking of IgE receptors. The conversion of radiolabeled arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) was strongly inhibited in L9 cells, whereas the rate of conversion of PGH2 to PGD2 was the same in L9 cells and S1 cells, indicating that PGHS was inactivated in L9 cells. The PGHS activity in L9 cells was about half that in S1 cells. However, PGHS activity in L9 cells increased to the level in S1 cells upon the addition of the hydroperoxide 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid or of 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. These results suggest that non-mitochondrial PHGPx might be involved in the inactivation of PGHS-2 in nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum via reductions in levels of the hydroperoxides that are required for full activation of PGHS. Therefore, it appears that PHGPx might function as a modulator of the production of prostanoids, in addition to its role as an antioxidant enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2033211733,"The ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to biosynthesize tetrapyrroles de novo has been investigated. Extracts of the bacterium do not possess activity for 5- aminolevulinic-acid dehydratase or porphobilinogen deaminase, two key enzymes involved in the synthesis of uroporphyrinogen III. Similarly, it was not possible to detect any genetic evidence for these early enzymes with the use of degenerate polymerase chain reaction. However, the bacterium does appear to harbor some of the enzymes for cobalamin biosynthesis since cobyric acid, a pathway intermediate, was converted into cobinamide. Furthermore, degenerate polymerase chain reaction with primers to cbiP, which encodes cobyric-acid synthase, produced a fragment with a high degree of identity to Salmonella typhimurium cbiP. Indeed, the recently released genome sequence data confirmed the presence ofcbiP together with 14 other genes of the cobalamin pathway. A number of these genes were cloned and functionally characterized. Although P. gingivalis harbors all the genes necessary to convert precorrin-2 into cobalamin, it is missing the genes for the synthesis of precorrin-2. Either the organism has a novel pathway for the synthesis of precorrin-2, or more likely, it has lost this early part of the pathway. The remainder of the pathway may be being maintained to act as a salvage route for corrin synthesis.

Among these organisms, several opportunistic pathogens have been described, which are mainly Gram-negative anaerobic rods of the family Bacteroidaceae (1Finegold S.M. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 20: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These bacteria are also associated with the colonizing flora of the oral cavity and are quite similar in terms of their physiological properties, requirement for heme, and utilization of mainly amino acids and peptides as energy sources. Furthermore, disease caused by infection of anaerobic bacteria is an area of growing concern, although little is known about the fundamental biology of many of these organisms (2Shah H.N. Gharbia S.E. Andrews D.M.A. Williams J.C. Mehta N. Gulabivala K. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 372-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Periodontal diseases result in gum tissue destruction and, in some cases, the spread of the infective anaerobic flora into the blood, which can cause soft tissue infections in the pulmonary tract, brain abscesses, and heart disease (3Scannapieco F.A. Genco R.J. J. Periodontal Res. 1999; 34: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Porphyromonas gingivalis, one of the main causes of such infections, is an obligate anaerobe whose colonies are recognized by their characteristic heme pigments on blood agar plates (1Finegold S.M. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 20: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Heme is central to metabolism in nearly all organisms, especially in its role as a prosthetic group involved in electron transport. Its synthesis occurs via a branched biosynthetic pathway, which is also responsible for the synthesis of other modified tetrapyrroles including cobalamin (vitamin B12) (Fig. 1) (4Warren M.J. Scott A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 180: 486-491Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar).P. gingivalis exhibits an absolute growth requirement for heme in vitro (5Shah H.N. Biochemical Analysis of Black Pigmented Bacteroides Species. Ph.D. thesis. University of London, 1981Google Scholar), although it is not known whether this exogenous heme is used to complement an inability of the organism to make its own heme or whether, for instance, the exogenous heme is being used as a source of iron. Similarly, recent evidence also indicates that P. gingivalis requires adenosylcobalamin as a prosthetic group (6Jackson C.A. Kirszbaum L. Dashper S. Reynolds E.C. Gene (Amst. ). 1995; 16: 127-132Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but again it is not known whether the bacterium is able to make its own cobalamin. The biologically active forms of vitamin B12, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, are required in methylation and rearrangement reactions, respectively (7Marsh E.N.G. Ballou D.P. Essays in Biochemistry: Metalloproteins. Portland Press Ltd., London1999: 139-154Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of cobalamin represents one of the most complex pathways in Nature, involving ∼30 enzyme-catalyzed reactions. These include the genes encoding enzymes responsible for the synthesis of uroporphyrinogen III (the first macrocyclic intermediate in tetrapyrrole synthesis), the genes encoding enzymes for the transformation of uroporphyrinogen III into cobinamide, and the genes encoding enzymes for nucleotide loop assembly and attachment to the corrin ring (8Roth J.R.

The steps required for the synthesis of cobalamin are highlighted in Fig. 2.Figure 2Cobalamin biosynthetic pathways. The aerobic and anaerobic pathways are outlined, highlighting the gene products required for the synthesis of adenosylcobalamin from uroporphyrinogen III. The aerobic pathway has been completely elucidated in P. denitrificans, and the intermediates are outlined on the right, whereas the anaerobic pathway has been partially resolved, and its intermediates are outlined on the left. The genes found in P. gingivalis are shown on the far left and correspond to the genes found in bacteria such as S. typhimurium that harbor an anaerobic pathway.Underlined proteins indicate those overproduced in this study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Studies over the past decade have demonstrated that there are at least two quite distinct routes for cobalamin synthesis, representing oxygen-dependent (aerobic) and oxygen-independent (anaerobic) pathways (12Blanche F. Thibaut D. Debussche L. Hertle R. Zipfel F. Müller G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1651-1653Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Raux E. Schubert H.L. Roper J.M. Wilson K.S. Warren M.J. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 100-118Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For the biosynthesis of cobinamide, the genes of the oxygen-dependent route are prefixedcob, whereas the genes for the oxygen-independent pathway are prefixed cbi (see Fig. 2). 1The nomenclature relating to the cobalamin biosynthetic genes is confusing. In the aerobic pathway, all genes for the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III into cobalamin are prefixedcob, whereas in the anaerobic route, the genes for the conversion of precorrin-2 into adenosylcobinamide phosphate are prefixed cbi, with the genes for the nucleotide loop assembly prefixed cob. Thus, the cobA gene refers to two quite distinct enzymes depending on whether reference is being made to the aerobic or anaerobic pathway. The major differences between the two pathways relate to the requirement for molecular oxygen and the timing of cobalt insertion: in the oxygen-dependent pathway, molecular oxygen is required to assist in the ring contraction process, and cobalt is added relatively late in the pathway, only after the synthesis of hydrogenobyrinic acida,c-diamide, whereas in the oxygen-independent pathway, molecular oxygen is not required, and cobalt is inserted into the macrocycle at an early stage of the synthesis, at the level of precorrin-2 (see Fig. 2). In this study, investigations into the ability of P. gingivalis to make tetrapyrroles (and in particular, cobalamin) are reported. Although the organism appears to contain a functional oxygen-independent corrin biosynthetic pathway, which is able to transform precorrin-2 into cobalamin, the presence of the pathway is compounded by the lack of any enzymes for the synthesis of precorrin-2. Horse blood was bought from Difco, and other media components were purchased from Oxoid (Hampshire, United Kingdom). The RapID ANA II diagnostic system was from Innovative Diagnostic Systems (Norcross, GA). Perchloric acid was purchased from Aldrich, and other chemicals were from Sigma (Dorset, UK). All general nucleic acid protocols were carried out as described (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), except that excess proteinase K and RNase were added during the lysozyme treatment stage since many of these bacteria produce a high concentration of nuclease. Harvested cells were washed twice in degassed assay buffer (50 mmCHES2 (pH 8.5) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm ZnCl2). Washed cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were disrupted in a high-speed vibratory tissue disintegrator (Mickle Laboratory Engineering Co. Ltd., Surrey, UK). Samples were vibrated with 1 volume of Ballotini No. 10 glass beads for 12 min at 4 °C. The resultant homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the clarified supernatant was removed. The beads were washed five times in 1 ml of assay buffer and recentrifuged, and the washings were combined with the crude homogenate sample. ALA dehydratase activity was determined by the amount of porphobilinogen (PBG) formed using a stopped spectrophotometric assay. The method was essentially as described previously (18Senior N.M. Brocklehurst K. Thomas P.G. Cooper J.B. Wood S.P. Erskine P. Jordan P.M. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), except that ALA (5 mm final concentration) was preincubated for 2 min in assay buffer at 37 °C, and the reaction was started by the addition of bacterial extracts (up to 2 mg of protein) to give a final volume of 0.5 ml. PBG deaminase activity was measured according to the method described by Jordan et al.(19Jordan P.M. Thomas S.D. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude cell extract (500 μl) was incubated at 37 °C in a final volume of 800 μl containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 μmol of PBG. The reaction was stopped after either 30 or 60 min by the addition of 0.2 ml of 5 n HCl. Ten microliters of freshly prepared benzoquinone (1 mg/ml) was added to the solution. The mixture was centrifuged; and after 15 min, the solution was measured at 405 nm to quantify the amount of uroporphyrin formed using an extinction coefficient of 5.48 × 105m−1cm−1. The activities of the long and short versions of CbiK, CbiKL and CbiKS, respectively, were determined using an in vitro linked assay similar to that described previously (20Raux E. McVeigh T. Peters S.E. Leustek T. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 701-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation contained 1 mg of recombinantPseudomonas denitrificans uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase (CobA), 0.1 mg of Escherichia coli PBG deaminase, 0.15 mg of E. coli uroporphyrinogen III synthase, 0.75 mg of S-adenosyl-l-methionine, and 0.1 mg of PBG. The assay components were mixed in 1 ml of degassed 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). To this assay were added 0.1 mg of CbiK and 40 μm CoCl2·6H2O as required. Spectra were recorded using a Hewlett-Packard 352 photodiode array spectrophotometer over the range 300–700 nm. Cobalamin concentrations were determined using a modified bioassay. Bioassay plates were prepared as described previously (21Raux E. Lanois A. Levillayer F. Warren M.J. Brody E. Rambach A. Thermes C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with two different indicator strains (Salmonella typhimurium metE cysG, AR3612; and S. typhimurium cbiB metE, AR2680). AR2680 requires cobinamide or later intermediates for restoration of growth, whereas AR3612 can grow in the presence of the earlier intermediate cobyric acid. This metabolic difference provided a means of determining if exogenously provided cobyric acid was being taken up and converted into cobinamide by the bacteria under investigation. Where possible, bacteria that were to be tested for the presence of cobalamin were grown in defined medium (17Milner P Batten J.E. Curtis M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 125-130PubMed Google Scholar). However, not all strains were amenable to growth in defined medium and had to be grown on Columbia blood agar plates. In this case, the background level of cobalamins available from the media had to be taken into account, and the results were based on the conversion of exogenously added cobyric acid (100 or 1000 nmol/plate) into cobinamide. Whole genomic DNA from P. gingivalis W83 was used as a template for initial isolation of porphinoid genes by PCR. Degenerate PCR was used to amplify a partial gene sequence of ∼365 base pairs encoding a fragment of cbiP. Degenerate PCR primers were designed based on a highly conserved region ofcbiP from known bacterial sequences (between amino acids 59 and 174 of S. typhimurium cbiP) using CODEHOP (consensus-degenerate hybridoligonucleotide primers for amplification of distantly related sequences) (22Rose T.M. Schultz E.R. Henikoff J.G. Pietrokovski S. McCallum C.M. Henikoff S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 26: 1628-1635Crossref Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Degenerate primers to two other genes, hemB (encoding ALA dehydratase) and btuR(encoding the adenosyltransferase), were also designed (TableII); but although these worked on control samples of DNA (S. typhimurium genomic DNA), they failed to amplify a product with genomic DNA from P. gingivalis. Primers to known DNA sequences were used to isolate cbiGF,cbiJD, cbiL, and cbiK (Table II).Table IIList of primers used in this studyGenePrimerSequencecbiPcbiPDEG-59a-5′GGGTTATAGAGTGGCTCCGTTTAARNSNCARAAcbiPDEG-174a-3′GATTTATCTCAGCCGGAGATCCNGCNCCYTCcbiPDEG-308a-3′CGCTTCCAGTGGGTCGAAATCNKYRWARTTbtuRbtuRDEG-5′GCATAATAGTACACACGGGGAATGGNAARGGNAAbtuRDEG-3′CTAACTGGTCTCATTTCGGTCACNRDRTCNGChemB (AlaD)ALAD528-5′GCHCCBTCNGAYAUGAUGGAYGGALAD955-3′TCDGCDCCDGCDCGYTTALAD865-3′CATKGCRTAKTCDCCNGANACYTGcbiLcbiL-EcoRI-5′GCGAATTCATGGAACGCTATCCTGTCCcbiL-BamHI-3′GCGGATCCACGGCTTATTGTCGCTTTGGcbiGFcbiGF-EcoRI-5′GCGAATTCATGTCGAAACCGAATCATACcbiGF-HindIII-3′GACAAGCTTGTAGGATCATGTGCGGAAGcbiJDcbiJD-EcoRI-5′GCGAATTCATGATCCTACTCTTCGGCGGTACTACGcbiJD-HindIII-3′GACAAGCTTCTATTCTCCACCGATACGAAAACGAATCcbiK L (pKK)cbiK-SalI-5′CGGTCGACAGGAGGAATTTAAAATGAAAAAACTGATTTTAGCGACcbiK L (pKK)cbiK-PstI-3′CTCTGCAGGCTTGATTGTGTCTCATTGCcbiK L (pET)cbiK-AseI-5′GCATTAATATGAAAAAATGATTTTAGCGACcbiK L (pET)cbiK-BamHI-3′CTGGATCCGCTTGATTGTCTCATTGCcbiK S (pET)cbiK-AseI-5′GCATTAATATGCTCTCATGTTCAAGCAACPrimers for insertion of genes into pET14b were the same as the specific primers above, except that all 5′-primers started withNdeI (CAT ATG), and all 3′-primers started with eitherBamHI or BgIII.

Conditions were as follows: one cycle at 95 °C for 3 min for denaturation and hot start with Taq polymerase (BioTaq); 35 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 45 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s; followed by one cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products of the expected size were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted (QIAGEN Inc.), and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The subsequent plasmids were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems Model 373 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to confirm the identities and sequences of the isolated genes. Cloning procedures were performed as described (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The isolated cobalamin biosynthetic genes from P. gingivalis, includingcbiL, cbiK, cbiGF, andcbiJD, were separately cloned into pKK223-3 under the regulation of a tac promoter by directional cloning. A second set of plasmids were also constructed whereby each gene or gene fusion was cloned into pET14b behind a His tag encoding sequence under the control of a T7 promoter. The pKK constructs were used to carry out functional complementation tests on either defined S. typhimurium or recombinantE. coli cobalamin mutants. The pET constructs were used for expression of protein for affinity purification by metal chelate chromatography. The plasmids and strains are described in Table I. The protein was expressed and purified as described in the Novagen pET manual. Briefly, a culture of the appropriate strain was grown in LB medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 37 °C until anA600 of 0.6 was reached. At this stage, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cells were grown for a further 2 h before harvesting by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 4 °C). The bacterial pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)) and sonicated at 8 microns for 4 × 30 s bursts using an MSE Soniprep ultrasonicator. The solution was centrifuged again (10,000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant was loaded onto a charged His-Bind column (1 × 2.5 cm). The column was washed in 10 column volumes of binding buffer and 6 column volumes of wash buffer (100 mmimidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)), and finally, the protein was eluted in 6 column volumes of elution buffer (400 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)). Protein was detected by the Bio-Rad protein assay and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing the His-tagged protein were pooled and desalted by passage through a PD-10 column that had been previously equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). Sequences, alignments, and comparisons were performed with the GCG software package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Searches of the Unfinished Bacterial Genome Data Base were performed using the BLAST suite. Evolutionary trees were constructed using PAUP Version 4.0. Since the gene for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, a vitamin B12-dependent enzyme, had previously been isolated and sequenced from P. gingivalis (6Jackson C.A. Kirszbaum L. Dashper S. Reynolds E.C. Gene (Amst. ). 1995; 16: 127-132Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether the bacterium is able to synthesize the coenzyme required for this reaction (adenosylcobalamin) de novo by determining the presence of any cobalamin biosynthetic genes. This was achieved using a degenerate PCR approach with primers tobtuR (11Raux E. Lanois A. Warren M.J. Rambach A. Thermes C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the cobalamin adenosylation enzyme, andcbiP, cobyric-acid synthase (Fig. 2). Degenerate PCR with thebtuR primers did not produce any DNA products of the correct size, although a negative result by this procedure does not mean that the gene is absent since the process is reliant on a high degree of similarity to gene homologs. However, the lack of success with these primers may also be explained by the fact that not all bacteria capable of de novo cobalamin synthesis appear to harborbtuR and must possess another, as yet unidentified, enzyme capable of adenosylation. Fortunately, degenerate PCR with the primers to cbiP produced a 350-base pair fragment of the expected size. Cloning and sequencing of this product revealed that the fragment has 54% sequence identity to cbiP from S. typhimurium. At this point in time, the non-annotated data from the P. gingivalis genome sequencing project became available on line. The cbiP sequence obtained from the degenerate PCR was found to match exactly that found in the P. gingivalisdata base. Furthermore, the full sequence of cbiP in theP. gingivalis data base demonstrated clear similarity tocbiP from other organisms. A search of the P. gingivalis sequence data base with other known corrin biosynthetic enzymes revealed the presence of 14 genes involved in the cobalamin pathway (cbiL, cbiH, cbiK,cbiC, cbiET, cbiGF, cbiJD,cbiB, cbiP, cbiA, cobD,cobS, cobT, and cobU) (Figs. 2 and3). These 14 genes encode enzymes that perform 17 different enzymatic transformations. The discrepancy between the number of genes and the number of enzymatic transformations is due to the fact that three of the genes encode bifunctional proteins, where two separate genes appear to have fused together (cbiJD,cbiET, and cbiGF). Of the 14 genes, 11 appear to be clustered into three operons, whereas the remaining three genes are dispersed randomly throughout the genome (Fig. 3). The identified genes appear to encode mainly enzymes that are responsible for the transformation of precorrin-2 into cobalamin (Fig. 2). An alignment of the cobalamin biosynthetic methyltransferases found in the P. gingivalis genome (CbiL, CbiH, CbiJ, CbiET, and CbiGF) with all other known cobalamin biosynthetic methyltransferases allowed a phylogenetic tree to be produced (data not shown) (23Raux E. Biosynthesis of Cobalamin (Vitamin B12) in Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus megaterium; Characterisation of the anaerobic pathway. Ph.D. thesis. University of London, 1999Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the P. gingivalis methyltransferases segregated with enzymes associated with the oxygen-independent pathway. Indeed, three of the other cobalamin genes (cbiD,cbiG, and cbiK) can also be considered the genetic hallmarks of the anaerobic pathway since they are only found in organisms that contain the oxygen-independent route (13Raux E. Schubert H.L. Roper J.M. Wilson K.S. Warren M.J. Bioorg. Chem. 1999; 27: 100-118Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Of significant interest was the absence of gene homologs that encode any of the enzymes of precorrin-2 synthesis. Furthermore, degenerate primers to ALA dehydratase failed to amplify any product, and enzymatic assays on crude cell extracts from P. gingivalis for ALA dehydr"

The human ALDH12 cDNA predicts a 487-residue protein with the 23 invariant amino acids, four conserved regions, cofactor binding motif (G209 XGX3G), and active site cysteine residue (Cys287) that typify members of the ALDH superfamily. ALDH12 seems at least as efficient (Vm/Km) in converting 9-cis-retinal into the retinoid X receptor ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid as two previously identified ALDHs with 9-cis-retinal dehydrogenase activity, rat retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH) 1 and RALDH2. ALDH12, however, has ∼40-fold higher activity with 9-cis- retinal than with all-trans-retinal, whereas RALDH1 and RALDH2 have equivalent and ∼4-fold less efficiencies for 9-cis-retinal versusall-trans-retinal, respectively. Therefore, ALDH12 is the first known ALDH to show a preference for 9-cis-retinal relative to all-trans-retinal. Evidence consistent with the possibility that ALDH12 could function in a pathway of 9-cis-retinoic acid biosynthesis in vivoincludes biosynthesis of 9-cis-retinoic acid from 9-cis-retinol in cells co-transfected with cDNAs encoding ALDH12 and the 9-cis-retinol/androgen dehydrogenase, cis-retinoid/androgen dehydrogenase type 1.

Sequential reactions generate tRA from all-trans-retinol: reversible dehydrogenation of all-trans-retinol into all-trans-retinal, and irreversible dehydrogenation of all-trans-retinal into tRA (7Napoli J.L. Semin. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 8: 403-415Google Scholar). Dietary all-trans-retinyl esters and all-trans-β-carotene provide all-trans-retinol and serve as the major sources of vitamin A activity for mammals. Diet also contains substantial 9-cis-β-carotene, which can undergo metabolism into 9-cis-retinol (8Chandler L.A. Schwartz S.J. J. Food Sci. 1987; 3: 669-672Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Nagao A. Olson J.A. FASEB J. 1994; 12: 968-973Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Several short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases convert all-trans- and/or 9-cis-retinol into all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal, respectively (10Napoli, J. L. (2000) Mol. Cell. Endocrinol., in press.Google Scholar), and RALDH isozymes convert both all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal into tRA and 9cRA, respectively (11Napoli J.L. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The RALDH isozymes belong to the ALDH superfamily, which consists of 86 eukaryotic members, including 54 animal enzymes that catalyze the metabolism of diverse aldehydes (12Vasiliou V. Bairoch A. Tipton K.F. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Substrates include acetaldehyde, aromatic and fatty aldehydes, other metabolic intermediates (e.g., succinic semialdehyde, glutamic-γ-semialdehyde, and 4-aminobutyraldehyde), and additional xenobiotics (e.g.,aldophosphamide) (13Yoshida A. Rzhetsky A. Hsu L.C. Chang C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). ALDH1 also serves as crystallins in the lens and cornea of vertebrates (14Abedinia M.

Biochem. 1998; 251: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, only human ALDH1, mouse ADH2, rat RALDH1, and rat/mouse RALDH2 have been characterized to any extent as RALDHs. The other candidates, ALDH6 and ADLH11, remain largely uncharacterized for a role in retinoic acid biosynthesis, and additional uncharacterized RALDHs occur (16Posch K.C. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19676-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding how tissues maintain steady-state concentrations of retinoic acid requires identification of the enzymes that catalyze the two reactions of retinoic acid biosynthesis and when and where each functions. Because rat kidney contains multiple RALDH activities (16Posch K.C. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19676-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used protein purification to obtain the amino acid sequence for a heretofore uncharacterized ALDH. The rat amino acid sequence was identical with the deduced amino acid sequence of a partial human genomic clone. We generated the full-length human cDNA and expressed and characterized the enzyme as an ALDH, i.e., ALDH12. ALDH12 has considerable activity with 9-cis-retinal, has much lower activity with all-trans-retinal, and can contribute to a pathway of 9cRA biosynthesis in cells co-transfected with a cDNA that encodes CRAD1, a 9-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (25Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Kidney cytosol (270 mg of protein) from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (16Posch K.C. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19676-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was applied to a Mono-Q column (1.5 × 8 cm) in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8 (buffer A). The column was washed with buffer A until protein elution ceased and then was eluted with buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl. The protein recovered was applied to Affi-Gel blue (0.75 × 15 cm) in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (buffer B). The column was washed with buffer B and eluted with 2 mm NAD+ in buffer B. Each of the two fractions was applied to a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 (buffer C) and eluted at 0.5 ml/min with a NaCl gradient from 0 to 250 mm in buffer C. Active fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A protein band of ∼54 kDa from the NAD+eluted fraction was excised and sent to Bill Lane of the Harvard Microchemistry Facility for sequence analysis. We identified a human genomic clone in GenBankTM (accession numberAL021939) that had a partial coding sequence of an ALDH with nine of the unique peptide sequences identified in the rat protein band. To clone the cDNA, 5′-RACE (5′-AGCTGGACCTGACGGTTGCCGGAATGC-3′) and 3′-RACE (5′-CCAGAGGTGCCCCTGATCTCCTTCACC-3′) were done with Human Kidney Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH). The program was as follows: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 3 min, 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 3 min, 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 3 min, and 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 3 min. A primer (5′-GGAGGTGATTGAAAGAGCCAACAACGT-3′) was used for nested 3′-RACE on the original 3′-RACE product to further amplify the sequence. The complete cDNA was cloned by end-to-end polymerase chain reaction with the same template and a program of 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 3 min; and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. A 334-base pair probe, corresponding to nucleotides 1361 to 1694 of the cDNA, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, labeled with 32P, and purified using a Micro Bio-Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad). The probe was hybridized to the Human Multiple Tissue Expression Array (CLONTECH). Prehybridizations and hybridizations were done in 10 ml of ExpressHyb solution at 65 °C for 30 min and overnight, respectively. The blot was washed five times in 2× SSC (300 mm NaCl and 30 mm sodium citrate) with 1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min and twice with 0.1× SSC/0.5% SDS at 55 °C for 20 min. The array was exposed to Kodak X-OMAT LS film for 36 h. This blot is normalized for RNA loading of each dot to account for average tissue differences in mRNA levels of eight housekeeping genes. Thus, the data show relative abundance of target transcripts in different tissues. The same probe was hybridized to the Human Multiple Tissue Northern Blot (CLONTECH). Prehybridizations and hybridizations were done in 10 ml of ExpressHyb solution at 68 °C for 30 min and 1 h, respectively. The blot was washed four times with 2× SSC/0.05% SDS for 30 min at room temperature and twice in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS for 30 min at 68 °C and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT LS film overnight. The blot was reprobed with a β-actin probe (CLONTECH) using the same protocol. The ADLH12 coding region was polymerase chain reaction-amplified with 5′-GGAAGCTTATGGCTGGAACAAACGCACT-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTAGTGGCTCCACCATTAGCA (underlining indicates restriction sites) and cloned into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to give pcDNA3/ALDH12. CHO cells were transfected with pcDNA3/ALDH12 (8 μg/100-mm plate) and LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested 24 h later and sonicated in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10% sucrose, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (buffer D), pH 7.5. A supernatant (800 × g spin for 10 min) was used for enzyme assays. Assays were done in triplicate in buffer E (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), pH 8.5, under initial velocity conditions. Assays with nonretinoids were done in 1 ml of buffer E by monitoring NAD(P)H synthesis (340 nm) at ambient temperature. Substrates were added in 4 μl of ethanol. Reactions were initiated by adding NAD(P)+ at a final concentration of 1 mm. Assays for retinoids were done in 0.5 ml of buffer E with 2 mm NAD+ at 37 °C. Retinoids were added in 2 μl of Me2SO. Retinoic acid was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (18Penzes P. Wang X. Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1342: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Lysates from CHO cells transfected with pcDNA3 were used as controls. Kinetic data were fit by nonlinear regression analyses using Graph Pad Prism. CHO cells were transfected with combinations of pcDNA3, pcDNA3/CRAD1 (25Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and pcDNA3/ALDH12. Twenty-four h after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium (5 ml), and 9-cis-retinol was added in 5 μl of Me2SO to a final concentration of 1 μm. One or 2 h later, the cells and their medium were analyzed for 9cRA by high pressure liquid chromatography (18Penzes P. Wang X. Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Two ALDH isozymes in rat kidney and liver that catalyze retinal metabolism have been cloned and characterized: (a) RALDH1, and (b) RALDH2 (16Posch K.C. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst. ). 1995; 166: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To characterize another, rat kidney cytosol was applied to Mono-Q chromatography to separate the P1 fraction, which contains RALDH1, from the P2 fraction, which contains additional ALDH isozymes (16Posch K.C. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19676-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mono-Q does not retain P1 at pH 8 but does retain P2. P2 was eluted from the column with NaCl and separated into two fractions by Affi-Gel blue affinity chromatography. The P2 subfractions were applied separately to anion exchange chromatography. The one not retained by the Affi-Gel blue column behaved as P2c, as reported previously (16Posch K.C. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19676-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The one that eluted with NAD+ behaved as P2a (Fig. 1 A). P2c was not studied further because its low pI implies that it represents RALDH2, which has a pI of 5.1 (24Zhao D. McCaffery P. Ivins K.J. Neve R.L. Hogan P. Dräger U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 5-22Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Fractions with RALDH activity from P2a were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A band that migrated with ALDHs (∼54 kDa) was digested in situ and sequenced (Fig. 1 B). Twenty-one of the 45 sequences occur in rat pyruvate kinase (M24359), 9 occur in rat methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (M93401), 3 occur in Sus scrofa aldehyde reductase (U46064), 3 do not occur in known proteins, and 9 occur only in human genomic clone AL021939, which has the partial coding region of a possible ALDH. The nine peptides included NQAGYFMLPTVITDIK, SSFANQGEICLCTSR, ISPWNLPLYLLTWK, AGVPPGVVNIVFGTGPR, LSLELGGK, ELNLPFGGMK, LQSGLVWTNCWLIR, FVEATR, and DSYDFFTEIK.Figure 1A, anion-exchange chromatography of RALDH fractions. RALDH fraction P2 from rat kidney cytosol was separated into two subfractions by Affi-Gel blue chromatography: one eluted in the flow-through, and a second eluted with NAD+. Each was analyzed by anion-exchange chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Affi-Gel blue binding fraction eluted in fractions 2–5 from the anion-exchange column, as had the previously reported RALDH fraction P2a (16Posch K.C. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19676-19682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions 3 and 4 of P2a contained 62% and 27% of the total recovered activity, respectively. The Affi-Gel blue flow-through fraction eluted at a high salt concentration similar to RALDH fraction P2c, likely representing RALDH2 (16Posch K.C. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

The cDNA produced encodes a deduced protein of 487 amino acids with the 23 invariant amino acids and the four conserved regions that typify members of the ALDH superfamily (Fig. 2). Also included are a cofactor binding motif (G209 XGX3G) and a cysteine residue (Cys287) in the appropriate locus to serve as an active site nucleophile (12Vasiliou V. Bairoch A. Tipton K.F.

ALDH12 shows the closest nucleotide/amino acid similarity with the hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida but has no more than 50% similarity with other human ALDHs (TableI).

ALDH12 had no detectable activity with 2 mm benzaldehyde at pH 5 or pH 6, but activity increased from pH 7 to pH 9. Activities at the physiological pH of 7.4 and the pH used for assays (pH 8–8.5) were 62% and ∼88% of pH 9 activity, respectively (Fig. 5). At substrate concentrations of 2 mm, ALDH12 was most active with benzaldehyde and NAD+ (TableIII). NADP+ provided lesser but substantial activity. Under these conditions, ALDH12 catalyzed the highest reaction rate with decanal among the straight-chain, aliphatic monofunctional aldehydes tested. As chain length decreased, so did activity. The addition of a second functional group to aliphatic monofunctional aldehydes had an inconsistent effect on activity. ALDH12 metabolized the four-carbon bifunctional succinic semialdehyde at a greater rate than longer-chain aliphatic monofunctional aldehydes (e.g., hexanal and octanal) but metabolized the five-carbon bifunctional aldehyde glutaraldehyde at a lower rate than shorter-chain aliphatic monofunctional aldehydes (e.g.,octanal and propanal). No activity was detected with eight additional xenobiotic or naturally occurring aldehydes. Substrates were not converted into detectable products by supernatants of mock-transfected cells, with three exceptions: hexanal, decanal, and glutaraldehyde had activities in mock supernatants that were 8.5%, 74%, and 23%, respectively, of their total activities in pcDNA3/ALDH12-transfected cells.Table IIIALDH12 net activitiesSubstrate (2 mm)Relative activityBenzaldehyde100 ± 6Benzaldehyde (1 mm NADP+)77 ± 3Decanal78 ± 20Succinic semialdehyde58 ± 2Hexanal50 ± 3Octanal47 ± 8Propanal41 ± 3Glutaraldehyde (pentane-1,5-dial)32 ± 6Acetaldehyde18 ± 3Betaine [(formylmethyl)trimethylammonium chloride]ND 3-aND, not detected.BisnorcholenaldehydeNDtrans-CinnamaldehydeNDCitralNDConiferyl aldehydeNDMalonaldehyde enolate (tetrabutylammonium salt)NDPyruvaldehydeNDtrans-4-StillbenecarboxyaldehydeNDNet activities (means ± S.D. of triplicates) are relative to benzaldehyde and 1 mm NAD+ with the exception noted.

The Vm of benzaldehyde varied from 14 to 41 nmol/min/mg, depending on the specific transfection. With 10 μm retinoids, ALDH12 activity was higher with 9-cis-retinal (739 ± 21 pmol/min/mg protein, mean ± S.D., n = 3) than with 13-cis-retinal (233 ± 5 pmol/min/mg protein). Forty-fold lower activity was detected with all-trans-retinal (19 ± 2 pmol/min/mg protein). Kinetic constants were obtained for representative substrates: benzaldehyde (most active at 2 mm), 9-cis-retinal (most active retinoid), acetaldehyde (prototypical ALDH substrate), and succinic semialdehyde (high activity) (Fig. 6). ALDH12 was most efficient with benzaldehyde (highest Vm/Km) but had the lowest Km value with 9-cis-retinal (Table IV) and was inefficient with acetaldehyde. Note that the differences between retinoid and nonretinoid substrates reflect assay temperature differences. 9-cis-Retinal was assayed at 37 °C; the nonretinoid substrates were assayed at ∼22 °C. The higher temperature would increase the rate at least 5-fold.Table IVKinetic constants of ALDH12 with select substratesSubstrateKmVm (relative activity)Vm/Km (×10)μmBenzaldehyde17.5 (19 ± 1, 16 ± 4)100 (98, 102)57Acetaldehyde10,240 (9330 ± 1840, 11140 ± 2340)130 (140, 120)0.13Succinic semialdehyde1,685 (1500 ± 400, 1870 ± 430)60 (60, 60)0.369-cis-Retinal3.15 (2.3 ± 0.3, 4 ± 0.5)6.5 (6, 7)21Data were obtained at ambient temperature except for 9-cis-retinal, which was assayed at 37 °C.Km and Vm values represent the averages of two independent determinations obtained with six to eight substrate concentrations in duplicate or triplicate.

To determine whether ALDH12 would convert 9-cis-retinal generated in vivo from 9-cis-retinol into 9cRA, CHO cells were transfected with pcDNA3/ALDH12 alone or with a cDNA encoding the short-chain dehydrogenase CRAD1. CRAD1 catalyzes conversion of 9-cis-retinol into 9-cis-retinal (25Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mock-transfected cells produced 25 ± 1 (±S.D., n= 3 plates) pmol/plate/2 h of 9cRA from 1 μm9-cis-retinol. CRAD1 alone produced 35 ± 2.5 pmol/plate/2 h (p < 0.001), a net increase of 5 pmol/plate/h. ALDH12 alone produced 42 ± 1 pmol/plate/2 h, a net increase of 8.5 pmol/plate/h (p < 0.0001). CRAD1 and ALDH12 together produced 199 ± 25 pmol/plate/2 h, a net increase of 87 pmol/plate/h (p < 0.0001) or 17- and 10-fold more 9cRA than either alone, respectively. The experiment was repeated with graded amounts of each cDNA. Transfection of CRAD1 or ALDH12 again produced only a modest amount of 9cRA (5 ± 4 and 16 ± 3 pmol/plate/h, respectively) (Fig. 7). Transfection with both was required for a marked increase in 9cRA. With fixed pcDNA3/CRAD1, a 6-fold increase in pcDNA3/ALDH produced a 2-fold increase in 9cRA. With fixed pcDNA3/ALDH12, a 3-fold increase of pcDNA3/CRAD1 showed no significant effect on 9cRA synthesis. Maximum 9cRA was synthesized by an ALDH12/CRAD1 ratio of 4. This suggests that the amount/activity of the ALDH determines the rate of 9cRA biosynthesis in this path, assuming equivalent transcription and translation efficiencies of the two enzymes. We identified an alternative ALDH12 transcript lacking nucleotides 910 through 1071 during cloning. The missing fragment consists of a single exon, indicated by the partial genomic structure of AL021939. The shorter transcript would encode a protein with 54 fewer amino acids, lacking 2 of the 23 invariant residues: Gly284 and Cys287. The latter serves as the catalytically active nucleophile (13Yoshida A. Rzhetsky A. Hsu L.C. Chang C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Indeed, the shorter form had no activity (data not shown). Northern blot analysis did not reveal two transcripts, probably because they were not separated well by gel electrophoresis. This report identifies and characterizes a new human ALDH, ALDH12, and demonstrates expression of a rat ortholog. Evidence consistent with the possibility that ALDH12 might function in a pathway of 9-cis-retinal metabolism includes the ∼40-fold higher rate of catalysis with 9-cis-versus all-trans-retinal and intense expression in liver and kidney, two organs that reportedly have higher concentrations of 9-cis-retinol than other tissues (5Heyman R.A.

Blaner W.S. Swisshelm K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8073-8084Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Experiments with cells co-transfected with the microsomal 9-cis-retinol/androgen dehydrogenase CRAD1 and the cytosolic ALDH12 show that ALDH12 accesses 9-cis-retinal generated in microsomes from 9-cis-retinol and can therefore function in a pathway of 9cRA biosynthesis in vivo. These experiments also suggest that the expression level of ALDH12, rather than CRAD1, determined the rate of 9cRA formation. Two other ALDHs convert 9-cis-retinal into 9cRA, rat RALDH1 and RALDH2 (11Napoli J.L. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 27El Akawi Z. Napoli J.L.

RALDH1 has equivalent efficiency (Vm/K0.5) for all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal, whereas RALDH2 shows ∼4-fold greater efficiency for all-trans- versus9-cis-retinal. ALDH12, therefore, is the first example of an ALDH with greater efficiency for 9-cis-retinal. Comparative efficiencies of RALDH1, RALDH2, and ALDH12 for 9-cis-retinal can be assessed from published data (17Penzes P. Wang X. Napoli J.L. Gene (Amst. ). 1997; 191: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1938-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). TheK0.5 values for RALDH1 purified from rat liver and purified recombinant RALDH2 with 9-cis-retinal are ∼5 and 0.5 μm, respectively (11Napoli J.L. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 27El Akawi Z. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1938-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Vmvalues of RALDH1 and RALDH2, respectively, with 9-cis-retinal are ∼2.7-fold and ∼0.2-fold of Vm values with all-trans-retinal. The highest Vm values of RALDH1 and RALDH2 with all-trans-retinal, obtained with purified recombinant proteins under similar conditions, were 52 and 105 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively (17Penzes P. Wang X. Napoli J.L. Gene (Amst. ). 1997; 191: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These data indicate efficiencies of ∼27 and 38, respectively, for RALDH1 and RALDH2 with 9-cis-retinal, compared with 0.8 ((0.065 × 40 nmol/min/mg)/3.15 μm) for ALDH12. The lack of ALDH12 purity also must be considered because activity was measured in the 800 × g supernatant of transfected cells. Fifty-fold represents a conservative estimate for a purification factor, placing ALDH12 near or greater than RALDH1 and RALDH2 in efficiency for catalyzing 9-cis-retinal metabolism. ALDH12 seems too restricted in substrate recognition to serve as a general xenobiotic clearing enzyme. That is, despite its seemingly disparate substrate recognition (Table III), ALDH12 showed remarkable specificity in some respects. High efficiency for benzaldehyde was eliminated by adding substituents to the phenyl ring—note the lack of detectable activity with coniferyl aldehyde andtrans-4-stillbenecarboxyaldehyde—or by separating the phenyl ring from the carboxyaldehyde (no detectable activity withtrans-cinnamaldehyde). Despite activity with all-trans-retinal, albeit low, ALDH12 had no detectable activity with citral, a simplified analog of retinal. Appreciable activity with short-chain aliphatic aldehydes was eliminated with the addition of functional groups (pyruvaldehdye, betaine, and malonaldehyde), except for glutaraldehyde. Taken together, these data suggest an active site structured or adaptable to specific classes of substrate(s), with recognition of short- and medium-chain aliphatic aldehydes possible because of their size and flexibility, not necessarily because they are preferred substrates. The situation might be similar to that of RALDH2, which has a protruding “arm” that wraps around all-trans-retinal to form an organized active site (29Lamb A.L. Wang X. Napoli J.L. Newcomer M.E. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 639-642Google Scholar, 30Lamb A.L. Newcomer M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); yet RALDH2 also recognizes acetaldehyde and medium-chain acylaldehydes, resulting from its initially unorganized binding pocket (23Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A function for the short transcript that translates an enzymatically inactive ALDH12 remains uncertain. It could serve as a control element for ALDH12 action (substrate sequestration?), perhaps produced under certain conditions, or it might function as a structural protein. Uses of ALDHs as crystallin and an androgen-binding protein indicate that such a transcript could translate a protein with a function unrelated to aldehyde metabolism (14Abedinia M. Pain T.

However, the protein is only 59% identical to human gelatinase B, whereas all previously cloned chicken MMP homologues are 75–90% identical to their human counterparts. In addition, the new 75-kDa chicken gelatinase lacks the type V collagen domain that is found in all mammalian gelatinase Bs. Furthermore, the secreted enzyme appears structurally distinct from known gelatinase Bs and the activated enzyme can cleave fibronectin, which is not a substrate for mammalian gelatinase B. Thus the results of this study indicate that a second MMP gelatinase exists in chickens, and although it is MMP-9/gelatinase B-like in its overall domain structure and expression pattern, it appears to be biochemically divergent from mammalian gelatinase B.

Four TIMPs have been described (5Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3890) Google Scholar, 22Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are highly proficient inhibitors of the MMPs and constitute the third level of control over MMP function (3Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). At least 23 distinct MMPs have been cloned thus far and can be grouped into at least four subclasses based on substrate specificity and domain structure (1Woessner Jr., J.F.

One subclass is composed of the interstitial collagenases, which are able to cleave fibrillar collagens. Members of the stromelysin subclass can digest laminin, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. The membrane-type MMPs compose a subclass whose members have a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain and are anchored to the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane (5Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3890) Google Scholar). MMP-2 and MMP-9 (gelatinase A and B) make up the gelatinase subclass and are the largest members of the family at 72 and 92 kDa, respectively. These two enzymes can hydrolyze denatured collagens (gelatins) with very high efficiency. The remaining members of the MMP family do not fit into the traditional subclasses since either their substrate specificity is novel, as is the case for MMP-20 (enamelysin), or they contain novel domains, such as the carboxyl-terminal interleukin-1 receptor-like sequence of MMP-23 (5Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3890) Google Scholar). The members of the MMP family share structural and catalytic properties and appear to have undergone diversification through exon duplication and shuffling (1Woessner Jr., J.F.

There are two structural domains that are found in all MMPs and function to stabilize the catalytic zinc ion in the active site. The catalytic zinc-binding site contains three histidines that secure the zinc ion in the active site (1Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar, 3Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol.

The propeptide region contains an unpaired cysteine whose sulfhydryl group occupies the fourth coordination of the catalytic zinc and maintains the latent state of pro-MMPs (9Springman E.B.

Gelatinase B also contains a domain that is homologous to the α2 chain of type V collagen (36Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of this domain has yet to be determined. While studying activation of the 72-kDa MMP-2 in cultured avian cells, a 75–80-kDa gelatinase was detected by zymography in the conditioned medium and cell lysates of a chicken macrophage cell line, HD11. The zymographic activity appeared weak and diffuse yet distinct from the 72-kDa gelatinase. Expression of this 75-kDa gelatinase also was observed in cultures of primary chicken embryo bone marrow cells treated with PMA or LPS. Isolation and characterization of this gelatinase demonstrated that catalytically it is a member of the MMP family. Cloning and sequencing of the cDNA of the 75-kDa gelatinase confirmed that structurally this enzyme is an MMP gelatinase. The enzyme does appear to be MMP-9-like in its overall structure and cellular expression pattern; however, it possesses a number of biochemical and amino acid sequence features that are distinct from all known mammalian gelatinase B enzymes.

Primary cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-transformed CEF (RSVCEF) were prepared and cultured as described (40Chen J.M. Aimes R.T. Ward G.R. Youngleib G.L. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5113-5121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary chicken embryo bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs dissected out of 18–19-day-old embryos (37Beug H. von Kirchbach A. Doderlein G. Conscience J.F. Graf T.

The epiphyses of the femur were cut off; cells were flushed out of the bone with a 3-cc syringe fitted with 21-gauge needle that was filled with DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2% heat-inactivated chicken serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were immediately placed in tissue culture-treated dishes. After 24 h at 37 °C, non-adherent cells were washed away with DMEM and adherent cells were grown in the medium described above. HT 1080 cells, RSVCEF, QT6 cells, and CEF were cultured at 37 °C in 7% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HD11 cells and chicken embryo bone marrow cells were cultured under similar conditions using the above growth medium supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated chicken serum. In order to generate serum-free conditioned medium, the cultures were washed with DMEM and incubated for 24 h in the growth medium without serum. Cell lysates were prepared as follows. Monolayers were washed three times with PBS and lysed at 4 °C with constant shaking in the tissue culture dishes with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100 supplemented with 10 mm EDTA and 40 μg/ml aprotinin. The cells were removed with a cell scraper, and the entire lysate was recovered from the culture dish and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 11,000 × g. The supernatant was harvested, and the pellet was discarded. The concentration of total protein in the extracts was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Gelatin substrate zymography was performed as described previously (40Chen J.M. Aimes R.T. Ward G.R. Youngleib G.L. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5113-5121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were diluted in SDS sample buffer in the absence of reducing agents and electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels co-polymerized with 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice for 30 min in 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated 16 h at 37 °C in calcium assay buffer (CAB), 50 mm Tris, 200 mmNaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Brij-35, pH 7.5). After incubation, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.2% in 50% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid) for 2 h and destained in 10% glacial acetic acid, 20% methanol. The 75-kDa chicken gelatinase was purified from serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) harvested from HD11 cultures treated with PMA (100 ng/ml) using gelatin-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (40Chen J.M. Aimes R.T. Ward G.R. Youngleib G.L. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5113-5121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SFCM (300 ml) was applied at 15–20 ml/h to a 7.5-ml gelatin-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated with CAB. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of CAB, and the 75-kDa gelatinase was eluted with CAB containing 10% Me2SO. Purity and protein concentration were determined by analyzing samples on silver stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (42Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). To purify further the gelatinase, the enzyme-containing fractions of the Me2SO eluate were concentrated and applied to an FPLC Superdex 200 HR16 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in CAB as described previously (43Aimes R.T. Li L.H. Weaver B. Hawkes S. Hahn-Dantona E.A. Quigley J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The gelatinase fractionated into the 60–80-kDa range, and fractions containing the enzyme were analyzed as above. A partial amino acid sequence of 75-kDa gelatinase was determined as described previously (40Chen J.M. Aimes R.T. Ward G.R. Youngleib G.L. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5113-5121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chicken gelatinase A was recombinantly expressed and purified from the SFCM of transfected myeloma cells. Briefly, the coding region of chicken gelatinase A (44Aimes R.T. French D.L. Quigley J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was cloned into theHindIII/XbaI site of the pEE12 expression vector (45Bebbington C.R. Renner G. Thomson S. King D. Abrams D. Yarranton D. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), transfected into the mouse myeloma cell line, NSO, and stable colonies were isolated as described (43Aimes R.T. Li L.H.

Yarranton D. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Colonies were screened for expression of gelatinase A by gelatin zymography. Positive NSO colonies were picked and expanded in culture. Recombinant gelatinase A was purified from SFCM harvested from the expanded NSO cells as described above for the 75-kDa gelatinase. Chicken TIMP-2 was purified using red agarose chromatography and FPLC gel filtration as described previously (43Aimes R.T. Li L.H. Weaver B. Hawkes S. Hahn-Dantona E.A. Quigley J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Gelatinases were activated with 2 mm APMA in CAB for the indicated times at 37 °C. Gelatinase activity in solution was measured using heat denatured 3H-acetylated type I collagen (gelatin) purified from rat tails (40Chen J.M. Aimes R.T. Ward G.R. Youngleib G.L. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5113-5121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated enzymes were incubated with the labeled gelatin (1 μg/μl, 8000 cpm/μg) in CAB for 3 h followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and counting of the resulting supernatant as described previously (40Chen J.M. Aimes R.T. Ward G.R. Youngleib G.L. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5113-5121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified chicken 75-kDa gelatinase or gelatinase A was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions. The proteins were excised from the gel; the gel slices were homogenized in water by repeated serial passage through two 21-gauge needles, and the antigen-containing slurry was sent to Biodesign (Kennebunkport, ME) for subcutaneous injection into rabbits. After two successive booster injections, blood was drawn from the immunized animal and serum was isolated and tested for immunoreactivity to the appropriate antigen by Western blotting. 75-kDa gelatinase and gelatinase A were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under non-denaturing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (46Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The membrane was stained with 1.5% Ponceau S, 5% trichloroacetic acid, destained with water, and the portions of the membrane containing either the 75-kDa gelatinase or the 72-kDa gelatinase A proteins were excised using a scalpel. The immobilized proteins were blocked for 1 h in PBS with 1% Tween 20 and then were incubated with agitation in the appropriate rabbit antiserum for 4 h at room temperature. The membrane strips were washed three times for 10 min in PBS, 1% Tween 20 and again two times for 10 min in PBS. Affinity purified antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7. The antibody preparations were neutralized with 100 mmTris, pH 9.0, protein levels were determined by spectrophotometry, and protease-free bovine serum albumin was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (46Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked 1 h at room temperature in 5% non-fat milk, 5% calf serum in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated overnight in blocking solution with affinity purified antibodies (anti-75-kDa gelatinase was used at 0.3 μg IgG/ml, anti-chMMP-2 was used at 0.1 μg of IgG/ml). The blots were washed in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at a dilution of 1:3000. The blots were developed using ECL chemiluminescence as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was harvested from PMA-treated HD11 cells by first lysing the cells in guanidine isothiocyanate and then performing CsCl gradient centrifugation (47Huarte J. Belin D. Vassalli A. Strickland S. Vassalli J.D. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription (RT) of total RNA was executed using the Advantage RT-for-PCR Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol with random hexamers or oligo(dT) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The random-primed cDNA was subjected to PCR using two degenerate primers in a reaction employing the Advantage cDNA Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH) and a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 480 Thermocycler. A hot start of 95 °C for 5 min was used, as per the manufacturer's instructions, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 4 min at 68 °C. The 5′ primer was based on the first 8 residues of the amino acid sequence of the 75-kDa gelatinase (LLSAPSDV) and consists of the nucleotide sequence 5′-GGGTACCCTNCTNAGCGCNCCNAGCGACGTN-3′ (GSP 1) where N is any nucleotide. The 3′ primer sequence is complementary to the nucleotide sequence that encodes the consensus sequence for the MMP catalytic zinc-binding site AHEFGH as described (44Aimes R.T. French D.L. Quigley J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) 5′-CGACGTCGACTGNCCRAAYTCRTGDGC-3′ (GSP 2, Y = T or C; R = A or G; D = A, G, or T). The underlined bases were added to facilitate cloning and encode a KpnI and aSalI site, respectively. This PCR gave a 1.14-kb fragment that was isolated and cloned into the EcoRV site in the multicloning region of pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA fragment was sequenced by dideoxy chain termination using Sequenase 2.0 (Life Technologies, Inc.) or by ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols.

By determining the crystal structures of the enzyme in complex with each of three different inhibitors and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic investigation, we evidenced the ionization of a hydroxyl group (pKa∼16.5) of an inhibitor, which forms a low barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) with a catalytic residue Tyr14(pKa ∼11.5), and the protonation of the catalytic residue Asp38 with pKa of ∼4.5 at pH 6.7 in the interaction with a carboxylate group of an inhibitor. The perturbation of the pKa values in both cases arises from the formation of favorable interactions between inhibitors and catalytic residues. The results indicate that the pKa difference between catalytic residue and substrate can be significantly reduced in the active site environment as a result of the formation of energetically favorable interactions during the course of enzyme reactions. The reduction in the pKa difference should facilitate the abstraction of a proton and thereby eliminate a large fraction of activation energy in general acid/base enzyme reactions. The pKaperturbation provides a mechanistic ground for the fast reactivity of many enzymes and for the understanding of how some enzymes are able to extract a proton from a C–H group with a pKa value as high as ∼30.

For example, the energetics of the seemingly simple heterolytic C–H bond cleavage is enigmatic, although it is a fundamental process found in a wide variety of biological reactions such as racemization, transamination, and isomerization (1Walsh C.

In almost all cases, a proton is abstracted from a carbon adjacent to carbonyl, carboxylic acid, or carboxylate anion group by an active site residue because the α-protons are acidic by virtue of the resonance stabilization of the enolic intermediate. Despite the acidifying effect, the pKa values of the α-protons are typically much higher than the pKa value of a catalytic residue serving as a general base in the proton abstraction. The pKa values of the α-protons of most aldehydes, ketones, and thioesters lie between ∼16 and 20, and pKa values of the α-protons of most carboxylate anions are ≥32, whereas those of active site bases are usually <7 (3Gerlt J.A. Gassman P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5928-5934Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The unfavorable reverse proton transfer poses a large thermodynamic energy barrier the magnitude of which is a function of ΔpKa, the difference in pKabetween the proton donor and acceptor, and is given as 2.303RTΔpKa (3Gerlt J.A. Gassman P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5928-5934Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar), corresponding to 12–34 kcal/mol for the C–H bond cleavages. The required amount of energy has to be supplied by favorable interactions between catalytic residues and substrate in the course of catalysis, and/or the ΔpKa must be significantly reduced in the active site milieu. The activation energy barrier may be entirely eliminated for reaction rates to approach diffusion-controlled limits that have been observed for some enzymes such as KSI1 and triose-phosphate isomerase. A concerted formation of either hydrogen-bonded or metal-coordinated enolates by the general acid catalysis was proposed to increase the acidity of the α-protons (3Gerlt J.A. Gassman P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5928-5934Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4Gerlt J.A. Gassman P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11552-11568Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar). However, given the few electrostatic interactions in the course of enzymatic reactions as judged from available structural information and the lack of plausible experimental evidence of a possible perturbation of the pKa values of substrate and enzymatic groups, the rapid rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions involving proton abstraction remain poorly understood. Many proposals including electrostatic stabilization, binding entropy, desolvation, orbital steering, and short, very strong LBHBs have been put forward to account for the catalytic power of enzymes in general and have been reviewed recently (5Cleland W.W.

It has been suggested that the formation of LBHBs within the protected interior of proteins provides large amounts of energy (>10 kcal/mol) for enzymatic catalyses (4Gerlt J.A. Gassman P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11552-11568Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 8Cleland W.W. Kreevoy M.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1887-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 9Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). When the ΔpKabetween the two heteroatoms approaches 0, the hydrogen can be attached to either atom, and thus the potential energy barrier between the two hydrogen positions is lowered. In low dielectric organic solvents, a number of hydrogen bonds (H-bond) between two groups with similar pKa values exhibit highly deshielded 1H NMR peaks (>16 ppm) (9Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), low isotopic fractionation factors, and other unusual properties (10Loh S.N. Markley J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The formation of two covalent bonds to the bridging hydrogen center was suggested to explain the abnormal physicochemical behaviors on the basis of neutron and x-ray diffraction analyses and theoretical calculations (11Schiott B.

The most unambiguous identification of LBHB was claimed to be the detection of the unusual NMR chemical shift for a participating proton (9Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). In aqueous solution, characteristically deshielded NMR resonances have been observed for several enzymes (12Kintanar A.

Among them, the bacterial KSIs are known to exhibit such NMR signals emanating from enzyme-inhibitor interactions. In this report, we present the crystallographic and NMR investigations of interactions of KSI with its competitive inhibitors, demonstrating a large perturbation of pKa values of both an inhibitor and a key catalytic residue at the active site, which bears a direct implication in the rate enhancement by the general acid/base catalysis in this and in many other enzymes. Wild-type KSI from Pseudomonas putida isomerase (PI) and its mutant D38N-PI were overexpressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified using a deoxycholate (DC) affinity column and a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (16Kim S.W. Choi K.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2602-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The D38N mutant PI gene was constructed by the site-directed mutagenesis method using a Muta-genein vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). 500-MHz 1H NMR spectra of PI in the absence and presence of steroid inhibitors were collected with Bruker Avance DRX500 spectrometer at −3 °C. Each sample contained 15 mg/ml protein and saturating amounts of steroid in a solution composed of 0.45 ml of phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5 or 8.5) and 0.05 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide-d6. Jump-and-return pulse sequence (17Platue P. Gueron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) was employed to suppress the water signal. A total of 1024 transients in 32K data points, with a relaxation time of 2.0 s and a spectral width of 17,000 Hz, were accumulated for each spectrum. Line broadening of 10 Hz was employed in processing free induction decays with the XWIN-NMR software (Bruker Instruments). The chemical shift was referenced to that of tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The crystallization of the D38N-PI·equilenin complex was described earlier (18Kim S.W. Cha S.-S. Cho H.-S. Kim J.-S. Ha N.-C. Cho M.-J. Joo S. Kim K.K. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14030-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The crystals of D38N-PI in complex with androstenolone (ANDRO) were obtained by the co-crystallization method. A small amount of ANDRO was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2 μl of the solution was mixed with 70 μl of enzyme solution (10 mg/ml). Formation of white precipitations immediately after the mixing ensured the presence of a saturating amount of the inhibitor. The crystals grew in droplets containing 2 μl of the mixture and an equal volume of precipitant solution containing 1.0–1.4 m sodium acetate and 0.1 mammonium acetate (pH 4.6). The droplet was then equilibrated with the same precipitant solution in the hanging drop settings at 23 °C. The space group of the crystals is C2 with unit cell dimensions ofa = 85.9 Å, b = 72.37 Å,c = 50.53 Å, and β = 90.65°, which is similar to those of the D38N-PI·equilenin crystals (18Kim S.W. Cha S.-S. Cho H.-S. Kim J.-S. Ha N.-C. Cho M.-J. Joo S. Kim K.K. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14030-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The crystals of PI in complex with DC were obtained by the co-crystallization method in the hanging drop settings at 23 °C from droplets of 2 μl of enzyme solution (20 mg/ml) and 1 mm DC mixed with 2 μl of the same precipitant solution. The complex crystallized in the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 36.58 Å, b = 75.21 Å,c = 96.13 Å. With the same precipitant solution, the uninhibited enzyme crystallized in the space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions of a = 36.40 Å, b = 96.12 Å, c = 74.40 Å (18Kim S.W. Cha S.-S. Cho H.-S.

The crystal packing interactions of the three crystal forms are nearly identical despite the differences in the space group. The diffraction data for the D38N-PI·equilenin and PI·DC complexes were measured on a DIP2020 area detector with graphite monochromated CuKα x-ray generated by a MacScience M18XHF rotating anode generator operated at 90 mA and 50 kV at room temperature. The diffraction data for the crystals of D38N-PI·ANDRO, which resisted growing big, were obtained from a flash-cooled crystal by using synchrotron radiation from the BL6A beamline at Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. The cryoprotectant solution contained 0.8 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m ammonium acetate (pH 4.6), and 20% polyethylene glycol 400. Data reduction, merging, and scaling were accomplished with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The 2.5-Å structure of the D38N-PI·equilenin complex determined previously (18Kim S.W. Cha S.-S. Cho H.-S. Kim J.-S. Ha N.-C. Cho M.-J. Joo S. Kim K.K. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14030-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was refined against the 2.1-Å data. The structure of the D38N-PI·ANDRO complex was solved by direct refinement of the structure of the D38N-PI·equilenin complex against the diffraction data, and the structure of PI·DC was solved by the molecular replacement method using the X-PLOR program package (20Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The conformations of the four aliphatic rings of DC were determined unambiguously because of the clear electron density of the inhibitor.

Open table in a new tab Dissociation constants (Kd) values for D38N-PI·equilenin and PI·DC were determined by monitoring fluorescence quenching upon binding of the inhibitors to the enzymes. Fluorescence measurements were carried out at 25 °C with a spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu RF5000) in 3 ml of enzyme solutions (5–10 μm) containing 10 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 5% methanol. Titrations were carried out by sequential additions of 3 μl of the inhibitor solutions at several different concentrations with a total volume between 30 and 40 μl. Before and after the addition of each inhibitor, the emission spectrum was scanned from 300 to 400 nm with an excitation wavelength at 290 nm. After correction of spectral changes caused by the dilution, the fluorescence of the enzyme at 334 nm for each inhibitor concentration was used to calculate the Kd values as reported previously (21Zhao Q. Mildvan A.S. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The nonlinear least squares fitting in the calculation was performed with the program Kaleidagraph Version 2.6 (Abelbeck Software). KSI from P. putida was used in this study. A homologous KSI from Pseudomonas testosteroniisomerase (TI) has been a prototype enzyme for studying allylic isomerization reactions for more than 40 years (22Talalay P. Wang V.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1955; 13: 300-301Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The homodimeric enzymes (Fig. 1 a) catalyze at a diffusion-controlled reaction rate the abstraction of the C-4 proton adjacent to the C-3 carbonyl group of steroid substrates and a subsequent reprotonation at the C-6 position via a dienolic intermediate. Site-directed mutagenesis (23Xue L.A. Kuliopulos A. Mildvan A.S. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4991-4997Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Xue L.A. Talalay P. Mildvan A.S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8325-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) suggested that Asp38 (TI numbering throughout the text) serves as a base for the abstraction of the C-4 proton, whereas Tyr14 and Asp99 serve as acids for stabilizing the developing negative charge on the C-3 oxygen by providing direct H-bonds to the dienolate intermediate (Fig. 1 b). The crystal structure of D38N-PI in complex with a reaction intermediate analogue equilenin at 2.1-Å resolution shows that the C-3 oxygen of equilenin (Fig. 1 c) is engaged in short H-bonds (<2.65 Å) with both the Tyr14 OH and Asp99 COOH, whereas the Nδ2 atom of Asn38 is within 3.6 Å of both the C-4 and the C-6 atoms of equilenin (Fig. 2 a). The mutant enzyme was employed because it is known to bind steroid analogues more strongly than the wild-type enzyme because of the absence of the negative charge on Asp38 (28Hawkinson D.C. Pollack R.M. Ambulos Jr., N.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12172-12183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The pKa values for the side chains of Tyr14and Asp99 are ∼11.5 (29Li Y.K. Kuliopulos A. Mildvan A.S. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1816-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and ∼9.5 (13Zhao Q. Abeygunawardana C. Talalay P. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8220-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), respectively. The unusually high pKa of Asp99 appears to arise from the encirclement of the residue by eight apolar side chains (18Kim S.W. Cha S.-S. Cho H.-S. Kim J.-S. Ha N.-C. Cho M.-J. Joo S. Kim K.K. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14030-14036Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The bound inhibitor must be in the ionized state (C-3–O−; pKa = 9.0 (13Zhao Q. Abeygunawardana C. Talalay P. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8220-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)) for the formation of charged H-bonds that are energetically more favorable than neutral H-bonds. This is supported by the ultraviolet spectrum of TI in the presence of dihydroequilenin, which is very similar to that of the ionized inhibitor in a strong aqueous base (30Zhao Q. Li Y.K. Mildvan A.S. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6562-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Figure 2Interaction of equilenin and ANDRO with PI. Stereoviews of the bound equilenin (a) and ANDRO (b) and the three catalytic residues are shown along with the 2Fo − Fc electron density map at 2.1 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively. Dotted lines indicate H-bonds, and their distances in Å are shown. Although not shown here, the hydrophobic part of the steroids is in contact with many apolar side chains of the enzyme. c,1H NMR spectra of PIs: A, free D38N (pH 7.5);B, D38N + equilenin (pH 8.5); C, D38N + ANDRO (pH 7.5). Peaks 1, 2, and 3 are assigned to the Tyr14 OH, Asp99 COOH, and an imidazole NH proton of a histidine residue, respectively (15Cho H.-S. Ha N.-C. Choi G. Kim H.J. Lee D. Oh K.S. Kim K.S. Lee W. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). At pH 7.0, peaks 2 and 3 are indistinguishable.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because more than 90 different steroid compounds are known to inhibit KSI, the enzyme is a good system to study protein-steroid interactions. ANDRO is one of the compounds we chose for this purpose. It is different from equilenin in that it contains non-flat A and B rings and a methyl group at C-10 (Fig. 1 c). The 2.5-Å crystal structure of the D38N-PI·ANDRO complex reveals that the methyl group at C-10 pushes a little away the side chain of Phe54, which is located above the B ring of ANDRO, when compared with the structures of D38N-PI and the enzyme in complex with equilenin. Except for this difference, the binding mode of the inhibitor is nearly identical to that of equilenin, exhibiting the H-bond distances between the catalytic acid residues and the C-3 oxygen that are similar to those observed in the D38N-PI·equilenin structure (Fig. 2 b). The 1H NMR spectrum of the D38N-PI·equilenin complex displays a highly deshielded peak at 16.8 ppm (Fig. 2 c). By carrying out 1H NMR experiments on the D38N-, D38N/D99L-, and D38N/Y14F-PI mutants in the presence of equilenin, we previously assigned the 16.8 ppm resonance to the LBHB between the Tyr14 OH and the C-3 oxyanion of equilenin (15Cho H.-S. Ha N.-C. Choi G. Kim H.J. Lee D. Oh K.S. Kim K.S. Lee W. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The H-bond is relatively short (2.57 Å, Fig. 2 a) and is embedded in a low dielectric milieu because it is surrounded completely by apolar side chains and the hydrophobic part of the steroid inhibitor with no access to water molecules (data not shown). The short H-bonded distance and the low dielectric environment are consistent with the criteria for the formation of LBHBs (9Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Because the C-3 oxygen of ANDRO is positioned at the active site similarly to that of equilenin with respect to Tyr14 and Asp99, we asked whether the C-3–OH group of the inhibitor might loose its proton in this active site environment. Although the pKa of the cyclohexanolic hydroxyl group of ANDRO has not been measured, it should be about 16.5, considering the pKa values of secondary alcohols (31Maitland J., J. Organic Chemistry. W. W. Norton & Company, New York1997: 824Google Scholar). The pKa is 7.5 units higher than that of the C-3–OH group in equilenin. As shown in Fig. 2 c, D38N-PI also exhibits a deshielded 1H peak at 16.8 ppm in the presence of ANDRO, indicating that one of the two intermolecular H-bonds between the enzyme and ANDRO is a LBHB (Fig. 2 b). Two of the three ionizable groups (ANDRO C-3–OH, Tyr14 OH, and Asp99 COOH) should be involved in a charged H-bond with similar pKa values because characteristically deshielded 1H resonances have been detected only for charged H-bonds. The ANDRO C-3–OH is most likely deprotonated because it results in the two charged H-bonds with Tyr14 and Asp99, whereas the deprotonation of either Tyr14 or Asp99 would result in energetically less favorable interactions, one charged and one neutral H-bonds (Tyr14–O−···HO–ANDRO and Asp99–CO(OH)···HO–ANDRO; or Asp99–COO−···HO–ANDRO and Tyr14–OH···HO–ANDRO). Deprotonation of both Tyr14 and Asp99 is not likely due to repulsion of the two negatively charged groups close in space (4.2 Å). Therefore, the downfield resonance can be assigned to either the Tyr14 OH or the Asp99 COOH, both of which are involved in a charged H-bond with the oxyanion of ANDRO. Two lines of evidence support the conclusion that the Tyr14 OH is responsible for the resonance. First, the slightly deshielded resonance at 13.1 ppm, assigned to the Asp99 COOH in the D38N-PI·equilenin complex (15Cho H.-S. Ha N.-C. Choi G. Kim H.J. Lee D. Oh K.S. Kim K.S. Lee W. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), is not observed for the D38N-PI·ANDRO complex (Fig. 2 c). This can be interpreted as a mismatch in the pKa values between the two groups at the active site, which is too large to induce a downfield chemical shift from the normal protein spectral region. Second, the chemical shift of the deshielded resonance is nearly identical to that of the Tyr14 OH engaged in the LBHB with the equilenin oxyanion (Fig. 2 c). A perfect match of pKa values resulting in the formation of a H-bond with a single-well energy potential is unlikely because the observed chemical shift is smaller than those (>18 ppm) of intramolecular H-bonds in symmetric molecules. Most likely, the pKaof ANDRO is lowered substantially to match closely the pKa of Tyr14 but not as low as to match the pKa of Asp99. Mutational studies have shown that the contribution of Tyr14 to the catalytic power of the enzyme is much more critical than that of Asp99 (26Wu Z.R. Ebrahimian S. Zawrotny M.E. Thornburg L.D. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Brothers P. Pollack R.M. Summers M.F. Science. 1997; 276: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Kim D.-H. Jang D.S. Nam G.H. Choi G. Kim J.-S. Ha N.-C. Kim M.-S. Oh B.-H. Choi K.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4581-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The difference is attributed to the ability of Tyr14 to form a LBHB with the substrate, which allows better delocalization of the negative charge of the intermediate than the normal H-bond of Asp99. The observation of the unusual downfield resonance is evidence for ionization of a group with a pKa of ∼16.5 as a result of the formation of favorable interactions at the enzyme active site. We present here the structure of the wild-type enzyme in complex with DC as an example of pKaperturbation of an active site residue. DC is distinctively different from other steroid compounds in so far as it contains an isopentanoate moiety on the steroid D ring (Fig. 1 c). Unexpectedly, binding of DC to KSI is “backwards” in that the isopentanoate moiety on the D ring interacts with the three catalytic residues whereas the A ring is located at the entrance of the active site (Fig. 3 a). This backward binding mode, which must be favored over the “normal” binding mode, reveals unusual interactions between three carboxyl groups. The carboxyl group of the isopentanoate moiety is within H-bonding distance to the side chains of Tyr14, Asp99, and Asp38(Fig. 3 a). Therefore, each of the acid-acid pairs, isopentanoate-Asp38 and isopentanoate-Asp99, should share a proton to form a H-bond. The isopentanoate moiety must be deprotonated to be engaged in three charged H-bonds through which its negative charge can be effectively delocalized. This H-bonding scheme should be energetically more favorable than the other three possible ones where the three carboxyl groups are engaged in one charged and two neutral H-bonds as depicted in Fig. 3 b. This indicates that Asp38 with a pKa of ∼4.5, estimated on the basis of kinetic experiments at various pH values (30Zhao Q. Li Y.K. Mildvan A.S. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6562-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), is in the protonated state for the formation of the energetically favorable H-bonds at pH 6.7, which is the pH of the crystallization conditions. Within 3.8 Å of the three H-bonds, no hydrophilic residue or water molecule is found, indicating that they are embedded in an apolar milieu. Although the pKa values of Tyr14and Asp99 would be quite different from that of the isopentanoate moiety, those of Asp38 and the isopentanoate moiety are likely to be matched. However, no unusual resonance was observed in the NMR spectrum of the PI·DC complex (data not shown). Insufficient strength of the H-bond between Asp38 and the isopentanoate moiety, as a result of sharing the negative charge of the inhibitor by the three proton donors, could be a reason for the absence of a highly deshielded resonance. We measured the Kdbetween the inhibitor and the enzyme by fluorescence titration and found that the Kd of DC at pH 7.5 for wild-type PI (45.74 μm) is much higher than that of equilenin for D38N-PI (0.81 μm). Therefore, the off-rate of DC from the enzyme could also be responsible for the absence of any unusual resonance. Using KSI as a model system, we demonstrated that the detection of the characteristic NMR signal from a LBHB between two groups with very different pKa values provides a unique experimental window for probing large perturbations of pKa values at the enzyme active site. In other enzyme systems, much more significant perturbations of pKa values could be observed by this approach. The experimental evidence of the large pKa perturbation of the inhibitor and the catalytic residue presented here indicate that analogous pKaperturbations of substrate and catalytic groups can take place transiently as a result of a natural process to form energetically most favorable interactions between the two. Therefore, estimation of thermodynamic energy barrier in the general acid/base catalyses is meaningless when it is based on the pKa values measured in solution. In this context, the enormous rate enhancement by KSIs can be readily explained. The proton transfer by KSI from the steroid C-4–H (pKa ∼12.7) to Asp38(pKa ∼4.5) is energetically unfavorable in solution and would require about 11 kcal/mol of energy by calculation. However, the two groups embedded in the apolar active site could have similar pKa values with the aid of Tyr14and Asp99, which form more favorable interactions with the dienolic intermediate than with the substrate (Fig. 1 b). Therefore, the energy barrier against the proton abstraction could be only a fraction of 11 kcal/mol, to which the diffusion-controlled reaction rate of KSIs could then be attributed. More drastic examples include cofactor-independent racemases. Glutamate racemases from several sources are known to abstract the Cα proton (pKa > 30) of glutamic acid by using a cysteine thiolate as a catalytic base without recourse to any cofactor or metal ion (33Gallo K.A. Tanner M.E. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3991-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Calculated energy barrier amounts to at least 30 kcal/mol, and it is unlikely to be met by the substrate-binding energy. Recent structure determination and mutagenesis study of glutamate racemase from Aquifex pyrophilus identified Asp7 and Glu147 as important catalytic residues that were proposed to make H-bonds with the transition-state aci-carboxylate (=COO2−) (34Hwang K.Y. Cho C.S. Kim S.S. Sung H.C., Yu, Y.G. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The two residues, most likely in the protonated state, should form energetically more favorable H-bonds with the aci-carboxylate than with the carboxylate group of the substrate in concord with the general principle that an enzyme binds its reactant in the transition state more strongly than in the ground state. The availability of the more favorable interactions with the predisposed general acid residues at the active site should increase the tendency of the Cα to lose a proton, i.e. it could lower its pKa near to that of the general base abstracting the Cα proton. Similarly, concerted general acid-general base catalysis of enolization was proposed to explain the rapid reaction rates of proton abstraction by some enzymes (3Gerlt J.A. Gassman P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5928-5934Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar) including mandelate racemase in which Glu317 and Mg2+ are suggested to serve as the general acids whereas Lys166 deprotonates the α-proton ofS-mandelic acid (35Mitra B. Kallarakal A.T. Kozarich J.W. Gerlt J.A. Clifton J.G. Petsko G.A. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2777-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As explained above, the large pKa perturbations of substrate and enzymatic groups provide a solution to the puzzling energetics of proton abstraction, and therefore, a mechanistic basis for explaining a large fraction of catalytic turnover rates of many enzymes employing the general acid/base catalysis. Finally, “pKa” may not be an appropriate terminology to use in an environment shielded from the bulk solvent, although we used it throughout the text in a conventional way. We suggest that “proton affinity” would be a more appropriate term to use.

Alternatively, the FcεRI-bearing fibroblasts were transfected with two chimeric constructs in which the cytoplasmic domain of Tac was replaced with a modified short form of Lyn kinase.

The catalytically active construct enhanced, and the inactive construct inhibited, aggregation-induced phosphorylation of the receptors. All of the chimeric constructs were largely distributed outside the detergent resistant microdomains, and whereas aggregation caused them to move to the domains in part, their aggregation was neither necessary nor enhanced their effects.

Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is stimulated by aggregation of the receptors and in the cells studied in greatest detail, the RBL-2H3 line (2Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), is effected by the Src family kinase Lyn (3Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Two molecular models have been proposed to explain the role of aggregation in stimulating the phosphorylation of the receptors. The transphosphorylation model we have used to study this system is based on the following experimental findings (4Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Yamashita T. Mao S.-Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar): (a) Lyn kinase is constitutively and weakly associated with a small fraction of the receptors; b) in vivo and in vitro, the constitutively associated kinase is able to phosphorylate the receptors but only when they are aggregated; and (c) the initial phosphorylation of the receptors, but not their aggregation per se, promotes their association with additional, more firmly bound, Lyn kinase. These findings suggest that aggregation stimulates the phosphorylation of the receptors by stabilizing the juxtaposition of the kinase with its substrate, thereby shifting the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (6Metzger H. Chen H. Goldstein B. Haleem-Smith H. Inman J.K. Peirce M.J. Torigoe C. Vonakis B.M. Wofsy C. Immunol Lett. 1999; 68: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A second translocation model is based on the following observations: (a) aggregates of receptors, particularly larger aggregates, become localized, at least transiently, in discrete detergent-resistant membranes (DRM)1 (7Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 8Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar); (b) such microdomains occupy only a small fraction of the total plasma membrane but contain a substantial fraction of the total Lyn kinase (7Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar); (c) upon aggregation, those receptors that become phosphorylated are largely found in the DRM; and (d) at least in some experiments (see “Discussion”), cholesterol-depleting agents, which interfere with the formation of such microdomains, inhibit the phosphorylation of the receptors (10Sheets E.D. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these findings indicate that the primary effect of aggregation is to localize the receptors to regions of the membrane enriched in Lyn kinase (11Baird B. Sheets E.D. Holowka D. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 82: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Neither of the two models predicates any aggregation-induced increase in the specific activity of the kinase per se, consistent with the limited experimental data on this question (5Yamashita T. Mao S.-Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We undertook the present studies for two reasons. First, to clarify whether the translocation of the aggregated receptors to DRM was a necessary and sufficient or simply an accompanying aspect of the interaction between Lyn and the receptor. Second, to establish a system with which we could analyze in as physiological a milieu as possible the effect of genetically introduced changes in the structure of the receptor or Lyn on their interaction. We used genetic constructs of portions of the receptor similar to those that had already been applied to this system by others (12Romeo C. Seed B.

Specifically, we used cDNA constructs in which the ecto- and transmembrane domains of a subunit of interleukin-2 receptors (CD25α, Tac) were fused to the cytoplasmic domains of the β or the γ chains of FcεRI, alternatively. The constructs were stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts that we had previously transfected with FcεRI (17Vonakis B.M. Chen H. Haleem-Smith H. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24072-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The latter transfectants contain minimal amounts of endogenous Lyn kinase and, therefore, are particularly sensitive to manipulations that either enhance or inhibit the interaction of active kinase with the receptor (17Vonakis B.M.

We performed complementary experiments by constructing chimeric constructs consisting of the ecto- and transmembrane domains of Tac to a construct of Lyn that had been mutated to remove the sites of myristoylation and palmitoylation. We then examined the ability of such constructs to influence the phosphorylation of the aggregated receptors, much as we had previously studied normally anchored Lyn (17Vonakis B.M. Chen H.

Extravidin coupled to horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (anti-PY) coupled to biotin (4G10), rabbit polyclonal anti-Lyn kinase, and Src family kinase substrate peptide (19Cheng H.C. Litwin C.M. Hwang D.M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17919-17925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Dr. T. Waldmann (NCI, National Institutes of Health) provided a hybridoma producing monoclonal anti-Tac (clone HD245). The hybridoma cells were gradually weaned off serum in successive tissue cultures. The antibody was purified from the serum-free supernatants using a kit containing immobilized protein A (Pierce) and labeled with carrier-free [125I]iodine using Iodogen tubes also from Pierce. (Iodination of the anti-Tac with chloramine T resulted in the complete loss of its bindability to Tac-expressing cells.) Monoclonal anti-Tac coupled to biotin (clone B1.49.9) was from Cappel (Durham, NC). Goat anti-mouse IgE, mouse monoclonal anti-DNP IgE (iodinated as appropriate), and covalently cross-linked oligomers of IgE were prepared as described previously (17Vonakis B.M. Chen H. Haleem-Smith H. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24072-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-caveolin was from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). SpinZyme® phosphocellulose filters were from Pierce. TableI shows selected sequences of the constructs we used for our studies. Dr. J. Oliver (University of New Mexico) generously provided the cDNAs for constructs consisting of the ecto- and membrane spanning domains of Tac fused to the C-terminal 42 residues of the β or of the γ subunit of FcεRI (TT-β or TT-γ) in pcDL-SRa296 (16Wilson B.S.

They were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into pZeo-2SV (minus orientation of the multiple cloning site), which had been digested with the same enzymes.

We also prepared a construct in which a stop codon was inserted after that coding for leucine residue 238 so that no cytoplasmic domain would be expressed (TT-0).Table ICharacteristics of Tac and chimeric constructsConstructC terminus of CD25αN-terminus of CD25α, of FcɛRI β or γ, or of LynJunctional sequenceBaseAmino acidBaseAmino acidTT-T714237715238..LLSGLTWQRR..TT-β714237660202..LLSGLRIGQE..TT-γ72023915027..SGLTWRLKIQ..TT-Lyn714237124..LLSGLEIKSK....TT-LynKR714237124..LLSGLEIKSK....Columns 2 and 3 show the number for the 3′ base in the 3′ codon of the open reading frame and for the corresponding C-terminal amino acid residue from the transmembrane domain of the Tac protein (CD25α).

The junctional sequence is given in the last column with the joined residues shown in bold type. In the construct Tac-LynKR, arginine substitutes for lysine at residue 279. For the Lyn-based chimeric constructs, we generated fusion proteins by polymerase chain reaction. cDNA coding for Lyn kinase mutated at its N terminus was prepared as follows: sense and antisense primers for the desired mutations of the intact wild-type short form of Lyn (5′-CTCGAGATTAAATCAAAAAGGAAAGACAATC-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGCCACTATGGCTGCTGCTGATACTGCCCTTCCGTGGCACTG-3′) were synthesized and used in polymerase chain reaction with the wild-type Lyn as template. The sense primer encodes a XhoI site at its N terminus that excludes the N-terminal methionine and glycine. The primer also substitutes the codon for cysteine with one for glutamic acid. A construct of Tac coding for the ecto- and transmembrane domain was generated by polymerase chain reaction with an XhoI site at its C terminus. The two cDNAs were digested with XhoI and then ligated to generate the fusion chimera (TT-Lyn) and subsequently subcloned into the expression vector pZeo. TT-LynKR was generated similarly using the Lyn cDNA that encodes the catalytically inactive Lyn generated previously (17Vonakis B.M. Chen H. Haleem-Smith H. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24072-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Analysis of each construct was determined using the Big Dye® kit obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) and shown to be as planned. Plasmid expression constructs (10 μg) were electroporated (0.4 cm gap, 200 volts, 500 millifarad) into 1 × 107 CHO-B12 cells, a cell line stably expressing 170,000 FcεRI under G418 selection (Ref. 17Vonakis B.M. Chen H. Haleem-Smith H. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24072-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholarand Table II). After 72 h, the transfected cells were placed under selection with 250 μg/ml zeocin. Clones were picked after 5–7 days, expanded, and screened for expression of FcεRI and the Tac construct. A second set of transfectants for TT-γ and all of the TT-Lyn transfectants were prepared using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). In a 6-well plate, 3 × 105 CHO-B12 cells were plated and grown overnight to 60–70% confluence. 1 μg of plasmid DNA was diluted into 100 μl of Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and mixed with a second solution containing 6 μl of LipofectAMINE in 100 μl of Opti-MEM serum-free medium. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min., diluted with 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM, and overlaid onto the cells. After 5 h at 37 °C, 1 ml of CHO-B12 growth medium containing 20% (2×) fetal bovine serum was added to the cells. The transfectants were then selected with zeocin, cloned and expanded as for transfectants generated by electroporation. Duplicate wells of each clone to be tested were grown to confluence in 24-well plates (≈2.5 × 105 cell/well). The cells in one set of wells were incubated with 1 μg/ml of [125I]IgE in 0.1 ml for 1 h at 37 °C, washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then solubilized with boiling hot 1% SDS, in a 62.5 mm Tris, 0.5× PBS buffer. The lysates were then γ-counted. For assessing expression of the Tac constructs, cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml of [125I]anti-Tac in 0.5 ml, at 4 °C for 30 min, washed four times with ice-cold Iscove's medium, and then solubilized and counted as for the cells labeled with IgE. To maintain the integrity of cell surface Tac, cells were harvested using 3 mm EDTA in PBS rather than trypsin for passaging and stimulation. In addition, all CHO transfectants were cryopreserved in growth media supplemented with 5% (CH3)2SO, and a new vial of cells was routinely thawed every 2 months to assure a consistent ratio of Tac to FcεRI.Table IIExpression of Tac and FcɛRI on transfected CHO-B12 cellsTransfected cDNAClone2-aClones with numbers ending in E were transfected by electroporation; those with numbers ending in L were transfected by LipofectAMINE.FcɛRI (×10−5)Tac (×10−5)Tac:FcɛRITT-β1A3E1.2 ± 0.102.7 ± 0.502.21A4E1.0 ± 0.012.1 ± 0.202.12A3E1.0 ± 0.070.9 ± 0.100.92C9E1.3 ± 0.010.4 ± 0.080.3TT-γA1L0.8 ± 0.102.0 ± 0.402.5A3E1.4 ± 0.200.3 ± 0.040.2B1E1.3 ± 0.090.9 ± 0.100.7C1L0.9 ± 0.102.2 ± 0.102.4D6E1.6 ± 0.104.0 ± 0.702.5TT-LynD6L1.5 ± 0.160.43 ± 0.040.29A6L1.2 ± 0.100.5 ± 0.100.43B1L0.78 ± 0.010.5 ± 0.070.64A5L1.5 ± 0.170.6 ± 0.060.40C6L1.4 ± 0.120.64 ± 0.080.44C4L0.95 ± 0.121.4 ± 0.181.5342C2E1.7 ± 0.160.02 ± 0.0140.01TT-LynKR33A4E1.2 ± 0.140.22 ± 0.030.1831A4E1.3 ± 0.150.62 ± 0.090.4834A3E1.5 ± 0.262.18 ± 0.481.44TT-T21A4E1.2 ± 0.110.68 ± 0.080.5824B2E0.96 ± 0.070.16 ± 0.050.17TT-051B2E0.800.160.2052C4E0.930.330.3652C2E1.050.440.4251C2E0.934.404.73pZeo4E1.5 ± 0.08NA2-bNA, Not applicable.NA5E1.2 ± 0.04NANAnoneB121.7 ± 0.19NANAA CHO cell line previously transfected with rat FcɛRI by electroporation and selected with G418 (CHO-B12 (last row)), was further transfected by electroporation or LipofectAMINE either with vector containing the zeocin antibiotic resistance marker only (pZeo) or in addition with Tac chimeras (TT-β, TT-γ, TT-Lyn, or TT-LynKR) or the wild-type or truncated Tac (TT-T and TT-0), and selected with zeocin.

Where aggregation of Tac was employed, the cells were incubated first with 2 μg/ml monoclonal anti-Tac-biotin (clone B1.49.9) at room temperature and then with 25 μg/ml avidin, for 10 min at 37 °C. FcεRI were aggregated with oligomers of IgE for 30 min at 37 °C when appropriate. Alternatively, Tac constructs were aggregated using a monoclonal anti-Tac followed by a polyclonal anti-mouse IgG. FcεRI were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with anti-IgE, and phosphorylation of tyrosines on their β, and the γ subunits was determined as described previously (18Wofsy C. Vonakis B.M. Metzger H. Goldstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8615-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Tac constructs were extracted with 1% Nonidet P-40 and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Tac. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 10% Tricine gels followed by immunoblotting first with biotinylated polyclonal anti-Tac or 4G10 and then with horseradish peroxidase-coupled avidin. For monitoring of FcεRI, CHO transfectants were sensitized for 1 h at room temperature with 5 μg/ml IgE, 10% of which had been labeled with 125I. For monitoring of Tac constructs, the CHO cells were labeled with [125I]anti-Tac for 30 min, at 4 °C. After washing the cells three times with buffer A (4Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), plasma membranes were isolated by Dounce homogenization and sedimented in 30% isotonic Percoll (23Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Successive 1-ml fractions were removed from the top of the gradient, the location of the visible band was noted, and the radioactive counts in each fraction were determined in a γ-counter. The method we used is similar to that described by Rodgers and Rose (24Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and by Field et al. (8Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were detached with 3 mm EDTA in PBS and resuspended in growth medium at 5 × 106/ml. After the desired treatment, 107 cells in 0.5 ml were diluted 2-fold with 0.5 ml of 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysate was kept at 4 °C with gentle agitation for 30 min. It was then mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose, transferred to a Beckman 344060 clear centrifuge tube and overlaid with 6 ml of 30% sucrose prepared in a pH 7.5 buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 2 mm sodium iodoacetate supplemented with protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, each at 1 μg/ml, and 5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzensulfonyl fluoride or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). The 30% layer was overlaid with 3.5 ml of 5% sucrose, again prepared with buffer A. Tubes were centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at 38,000 rpm for12–14 h. Successive 1-ml fractions were removed from the top of the gradient. All fractions were counted and then diluted with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5% prior to immunoprecipitations of FcεRI or 1% Triton X-100 for immunoprecipitation with anti-Tac. Triplicate immunoprecipitates with anti-Lyn, anti-Tac, or control antibodies were incubated in 25 μl of kinase assay buffer (25 mm Pipes, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.2, 5 mmMnCl2, 2 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mmNa3VO4) containing 2 mm substrate peptide. Reactions were initiated by addition of ATP (100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)) at 25 °C and vortexed every 10–15 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 50% (v/v) acetic acid. The peptide was then isolated using phosphocellulose filters. The filters were washed twice with 0.5 ml of 0.075m phosphoric acid and then counted in a scintillation counter in Filtron-X mixture. CHO cells previously transfected with FcεRI (17Vonakis B.M. Chen H. Haleem-Smith H. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24072-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were further transfected by electroporation with Tac (TT-T) or a chimeric construct containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of Tac and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of either the β chain (TT-β) or the γ chain of FcεRI (TT-γ). Stable clones that had been selected with zeocin and characterized for their expression of FcεRI and the Tac constructs are listed in Table II. The ratio of TT-β to FcεRI ranged from 0.3 to 2.2, and the that of TT-γ to FcεRI ranged from 0.2 to 2.5. When analyzed by Western blotting, anti-Tac immunoprecipitates of the detergent extracts of such transfectants revealed a diffuse band of 55 kDa (Fig. 1, lanes 1,4, and 6). Although the peptide molecular mass of the constructs is only ≈30 kDa, glycosylation of the ectodomain of Tac is known to retard its mobility. The bands with apparently lower molecular mass (38, 40 kDa) likely represent non- or hypo-glycosylated constructs not expressed on the cell surface. Such species were previously described for chimeric constructs of Tac fused to the cytoplasmic portion of the T cell receptor ζ chain or the γ chain of FcεRI (13Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8905-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the results of an experiment in which cells from clone 2A3E expressing on their surface approximately 0.9 TT-β per FcεRI (Table II) were first reacted with anti-Tac, or not, to aggregate the Tac constructs. They were then reacted with 500 ng/ml of either monomeric IgE or a mixture of trimeric and tetrameric IgE for 30 min. Cells transfected with receptors only (CHO-B12) were treated similarly. The receptors were immunoprecipitated and Western blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine. The odd numbered lanes show that there is only minimal phosphorylation of the receptors on cells reacted with the monomeric IgE, whereas substantial phosphorylation of the β and γ subunits is apparent in cells reacted with the oligomers. Similar results were obtained in the cells transfected with TT-β, but in this and repeated similar experiments analyzed quantitatively, the phosphorylation was substantially less (−70% in the experiment illustrated). Prior aggregation of the Tac-β constructs neither enhanced nor diminished the inhibition (lane 6 versus lane 8). Additional studies examined the relationship between the ratio of TT-β to FcεRI and the inhibition of phosphorylation. The IgE receptors on cells with TT-β to FcεRI ratios of either 0.3 or 0.9 were aggregated with increasing concentrations of antigen, and the phosphotyrosine on the receptor was compared with identically stimulated control cells (cells transfected solely with the zeocin marker-containing plasmid). A clone expressing a TT-β to FcεRI ratio of 0.3 (clone 2C9E) and stimulated with 80, 150, or 300 ng antigen/ml showed"

To determine the importance of this novel ligand and the contiguous residues to CooA function, we have altered the N terminus through two approaches: site-directed mutagenesis and regional randomization, and characterized the resulting CooA variants. While Pro2appears to be optimal for CooA function, it is not essential and a variety of studied variants at this position have substantial CO-sensing function. Surprisingly, even alterations that add a residue (where Pro2 is replaced by Met1-Tyr2, for example) accumulate heme-containing CooA with functional properties that are similar to those of wild-type CooA. Other nearby residues, such as Phe5 and Asn6 appear to be important for either the structural integrity or the function of CooA.

The role of nitric oxide in a variety of important biochemical processes (1Verma A. Hirsch D.J. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H.

Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). FixL, which modulates the expression of genes responsible for nitrogen fixation in rhizobia, is an example of an oxygen sensor (5Gilles-Gonzales M.A. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 6Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rodgers K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4178-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). An oxygen sensor inEscherichia coli, termed DOS (“direct oxygen sensor”), has been reported although its physiological role remains undefined (7Delgado-Nixon V.M. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Finally, for carbon monoxide (CO), CooA, theCO-oxidation activator protein, modulates the expression of genes required for the utilization of CO as a sole energy source in the photosynthetic bacteriumRhodospirillum rubrum (8Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the above mentioned proteins have in common a heme prosthetic group to which their respective gas molecules bind. The binding event is then followed by a conformational change in the protein that effects activity. Numerous studies have clearly demonstrated the physiological importance of CO in a wide variety of processes (9Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 10Morita T. Mitsialis S.A. Kioke H. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 5: 255-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), direct evidence of a CO-receptor in eukaryotic signal transduction systems is lacking. CooA senses CO through a heme moiety and represents the current model system for biological CO-sensing. CooA belongs to the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and fumurate and nitrate reductase activator protein superfamily of transcriptional activators (15Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CooA is an ∼50-kDa homodimeric protein, with each monomer possessing a heme that is six-coordinate under all oxidation and ligation states (16Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an unusual redox-mediated axial ligand exchange occurs in CooA in that a cysteine ligand (Cys75) in the oxidized (FeIII) form is replaced by a histidine ligand (His77) upon reduction of the heme-iron to the FeII form (17Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y.

Johnson M.K Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12805-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The identification of the axial ligand trans to the Cys75/His77pair, which is believed to be provided by the protein based on the observation that the FeIII and FeII forms of CooA are six-coordinate and low-spin, had been unclear although spectroscopic studies have suggested a neutral nitrogen ligand (19Vogel K.V. Spiro T.G. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Dhawan I.K. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Johnson M.K Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12805-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Finally, the ligand that is displaced upon binding CO remains speculative. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of FeII CooA has been solved by x-ray diffraction techniques (21Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This report showed that the general folding topology of CooA was indeed similar to that of CRP (22Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the verification of His77 as one of the heme-axial ligands in FeII CooA, inspection of the structure identified the other axial ligand as an N-terminal proline residue (Pro2; Met1 is removed by processing) from the other subunit of the dimer. This structural environment represents an unprecedented axial ligation arrangement for a heme protein. In a previous study (18Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we altered His77 and found that the UV-visual spectra of these variants was normal in the FeIII form (when Cys75 is the ligand on that side of the heme) but was perturbed in the FeII form, when His77 would normally be the ligand. Surprisingly, while the UV-visible absorption spectra of the FeII-CO forms of these His77 variants was similar to that of wild type, they were unable to undergo the conformational change in response to CO that is necessary for DNA binding (18Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, His77 variants in the FeII form bind cyanide with high affinity (23Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alteration of His77 therefore perturbs the FeIIform of CooA as well as its ability to properly respond to CO binding. In this present study, we have altered the other side of the heme face in FeII CooA, i.e. the Pro2 ligand and contiguous residues, and have found that variants in that region show surprising functional similarity to WT CooA. We then purified a selected variant and characterized its biochemical parameters in detail. Implications concerning the mechanism of activation in the WT CooA protein are discussed. The construction of E. colistrains expressing WT CooA, CooA variants altered in the region of Pro2 by site-directed mutagenesis, and of strains expressing WT CooA and CooA variants in combination with a chromosomally encoded β-galactosidase reporter system have been described previously (18Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Site-directed variants were constructed in a pKK233–3-based expression plasmid (24Brosius J. Messing J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6929-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), while region randomization variants were constructed in a pEXT20-based expression plasmid (25Dykxhoorn D.M. St. Pierre R. Linn T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 177: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) as the screening methodology (described below) depends on the tighter control of CooA expression provided by this vector. Strains containing the PcooF-lacZ reporter fusion were grown in rich medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (18Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These inocula were then diluted 40-fold into anaerobic 120-ml stoppered serum vials containing 20 ml of MOPS-buffered medium (23Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. For CO-induced cultures the headspace was made 2% (v/v) with CO gas. Cultures were grown with shaking at 30 °C to mid to late-log phase (A600 0.7 to 1.5), cell pellets were prepared and frozen, and β-galactosidase activities measured (26Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1995) in Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 3nd Ed, pp. 13-30, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). To determine the functional importance of residues near the N terminus of CooA, as well as to create some novel variants for future analysis, we employed an unusual mutagenic approach of the complete randomization of certain portions of the cooA gene. This approach will be described in more detail elsewhere, but the salient features are the following. A library ofcooA-expressing clones was created, by PCR amplification with an oligonucleotide fragment bearing the randomized region (described below) and then the resulting cooA library was ligated into pEXT20 and transformed into the PcooF-lacZ reporter host. The resulting clones were screened for CooA-dependent expression of β-galactosidase in the presence of CO. Only clones that provided a reasonable level of function were then sequenced and this provided a sense of the range of acceptable residues throughout the randomized region. The method is similar to that of phage display (27Winter J. Cleland J.L. Criak C.S. Bacteriophage Display libraries, in Protein Engineering, Principles and Practice. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 349-367Google Scholar) except that our approach uses a genetic screen for interesting clones, whereas phage display uses a physical screen. Simultaneous randomization of residues 2–3 or 2–6 was achieved using multiple sets of primers (Genosys) and three separate rounds of PCR using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Randomization primers were synthesized with a mixture of all four nucleotides at each base in the region to be randomized; this region was flanked by wild-type sequence. All other primers used in the process were non-mutagenic. In the first round of PCR, a second primer was used with the randomization primer to create a pool of DNA fragments, each completely random at the same multiple specified positions (i.e. the positions coding for residues 2–3 or 2–6) but otherwise encoding a WT portion of CooA; for technical reasons, the template contained a frameshift mutation within the region to be randomized. In the second round of PCR amplification, a second pair of primers was used to produce a DNA fragment bearing the remainder of WT CooA; this fragment overlapped with a WT tail of the randomized fragment. The fragments from the first and second rounds of PCR were then annealed at their overlapping regions, extended, and amplified in a third round of PCR, resulting in a pool of DNA fragments each containing the entirety of cooA with a randomized region of interest. Restriction sites incorporated into the external primers allowed directional ligation into pEXT20-based plasmids (25Dykxhoorn D.M. St. Pierre R. Linn T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 177: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) with subsequent high-efficiency electroporation into the aforementioned β-galactosidase reporter host (UQ1639). Transformed cells were spread on 1 × MOPS plates (23Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and active variants were identified after anaerobic growth in the presence of 1% CO at 30 °C and were retested for CO-dependence. The randomized regions of these variants were sequenced. The purification of WT CooA and the P2Y variant (>95% homogeneity) were performed using procedures described previously (18Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The heme content of CooA preparations were quantified using the reduced pyridine-hemochromogen method (28DeDuve C. Acta Chem. Scand. 1948; 2: 264-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal analysis of purified P2Y CooA was performed at the Macromolecular Structure Facility of Michigan State University. Preparation of cell-free lysates and their analysis by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy from E. coli strains expressing WT and variant CooAs were performed as described (18Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cell pellets from 1.5-ml culture were lysed enzymatically at room temperature for 20 min in a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mg/ml lysozyme) and subsequently treated with DNase for 10 min in this buffer amended to 100 mm NaCl, 20 mmMgCl2, and 5 μg/ml DNase I. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The Soret peak intensity, corrected for a −CooA extract blank, was measured in 150 μl of supernatant and compared with the accumulation of wt CooA. In this study, all spectra were acquired as described (23Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Dependence of the spectra of P2Y FeIII CooA on the pH of the solution were performed using ∼4 μm isolated P2Y FeIII CooA in the following buffers: pH 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5; 0.1 m MOPS, pH 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0; 0.1 m Tris HCl, pH 9.5, 10.0, and 10.5; 0.1 m glycine/NaOH. Absorbance changes as a function of pH in the 388-nm Soret peak (high-spin component) and in the 423-nm Soret peak (low-spin component) were used to estimate the pKa of the spectral transition. Isolated P2Y FeIII CooA was buffered by mixing 200 μl of the isolated protein (145 μm) with 50 μl of 500 mmbuffer (pH 7.0, MOPS, and pH 10.0, glycine/NaOH) to provide a final buffer concentration equal to 100 mm and a final heme concentration ∼120 μm. Samples were then degassed on an argon manifold to remove dissolved oxygen, frozen, and stored at 77 K. Spectra were recorded on a Varian E-15 spectrometer, with an Oxford Cryostat 3120 system to monitor and regulate the temperature. The magnetic field was measured using a Varian 929801 gaussmeter with a Tektronix type RM 503 oscilloscope and the microwave frequency (9.2 GHz, X-band) was monitored using a Hewlett Packard 5255A frequency counter. The spectra were recorded at 4 K and 200 microwatt power for the low-field region (30–2030 Gauss), and at 23 K and 50 microwatt power for the high-field region (1850–3850 Gauss). Spectral analysis was performed using a “rhombogram” computer program 2W. R. Hagen, Rhombo, version 1.0. for the calculation of theoretical g values. We have developed an assay for detecting DNA binding by the CooA·CO complex, based on fluorescence polarization (FP) (30Checovich W.J. Bolger R.E. Burke T. Nature. 1995; 375: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 31Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), in order to test quantitatively the activity (i.e. DNA binding in response to CO binding to the heme of CooA) of our CooA protein preparations. The extent of FP of a freely tumbling molecule that has been conjugated with a flourescent tag is directly related to molecular volume when viscosity and temperature are held constant. The FP technique exploits changes in the molecular volume of a target molecule as a result of macromolecular interactions. Thus, the extent of FP of a fluorescently labeled DNA fragment (containing the promoter sequence ofcooF, termed PcooF) increases upon binding by active CooA. The value of FP is measured as anisotropy, which is a dimensionless parameter related to the intensity of parallel and perpendicular absorbed light components compared with the total intensity (31Lundblad J.R.

The FP technique has been applied successfully to other DNA-binding protein systems, including CRP (32Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 287: 539-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The following conditions were arrived at after testing effects of ionic strength, cation concentration, and protein and probe concentration (data not shown). Equimolar amounts of two complementary 26-base pair oligonucleotides (containing the cooF promoter, PcooF: 5′-ATAACTGTCATCTGGCCGACAGACGG-3′), one of which was 5′ end-labeled with Texas Red (Genosys), were mixed and heated at 95 °C for 2 min in a water bath and then allowed to anneal by cooling slowly to room temperature over a 2-h time period. Sufficient hybridization (>90%) was verified by resolving the double-stranded probe using non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% (w/v); in Tris borate-EDTA, pH 8.0) against a 26-base pair single-stranded oligonucleotide control. Binding assays were performed in the following buffer components at their respective final concentrations: Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (20 mm), CaCl2 (6 mm), KCl (50 mm), glycerol (5% (v/v)) and dithiothreitol (1 mm). The DNA probe (6.4 nm) and varying concentrations of purified CooA samples (∼0.5–800 nm) were mixed in 5 × 60-mm test tubes that were fitted with rubber septa. Samples were then reduced by the addition of sodium dithionite to 2 mm. Binding assays were initiated by the addition of a small volume of CO-saturated water determined to fully saturate CooA, followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 min to achieve equilibrium. Fluorescence polarization (anisotropy) was measured at 25 °C using a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization detector (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI) using 594 nm excitation and 620 nm emission filters designed for measuring the Texas Red fluorescence. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by non-linear curve fitting of the binding data (corrected for quenching) using the scheme of Lundblad et al. (31Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because of the novelty of the Pro2 ligand, we created a small set of CooA variants that were expected to perturb that ligand. It is known that the terminal Met is removed when the second residue is small, but not when it is large (34Miller C.G. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 945Google Scholar), so a variety of changes were made as noted in TableI.Table IProperties of CooA variants altered in the axial ligands through site-directed mutagenesisCooAN-terminal sequence 1-aPredicted protein sequence of residues at the N terminus, although the FN residues that are present in all these proteins.% Accumulation 1-b% accumulation in extracts relative to that of WT CooA based on the reduced spectrum for Pro2 region variants and based on the oxidized spectrum for the His77 variants (rounded to the nearest 5%).% β-Gal 1-aPredicted protein sequence of residues at the N terminus, although the FN residues that are present in all these proteins.(FeIII) Soret (A388/A423)−CO+COpKK223012wt 1-dAppears like WT FeIIIspectrum, with a ratio of ∼0.3.WTPPRFN1004100wtP2VVPRFN2031050.9P2HMHPRFN605850.85P2YMYPRFN 1-eThis sequence in purified P2Y CooA was confirmed.552761.6P2C P3CCCRFN57992.2ΔP3PRFN2051071.29P3VPVRFN<5193ND 1-fND, not determined.ΔP3 ΔR4PFN1071311.5R4APPAFN15267NDR4SPPSFN5244NDH77FPPRFN 1-gAll His77 variants have the N-terminal of WT CooA.153230wtH77YPPRFN703737wtH77WPPRFN151011wtH77APPRFN7055wtH77GPPRFN7056wtH77CPPRFN701112wtH77MPPRFN701212wtc β-Galactosidase levels are expressed as a percent of that of WT CooA in the presence of CO.1-a Predicted protein sequence of residues at the N terminus, although the FN residues that are present in all these proteins.1-b % accumulation in extracts relative to that of WT CooA based on the reduced spectrum for Pro2 region variants and based on the oxidized spectrum for the His77 variants (rounded to the nearest 5%).1-d Appears like WT FeIIIspectrum, with a ratio of ∼0.3.1-e This sequence in purified P2Y CooA was confirmed.1-f ND, not determined.1-g All His77 variants have the N-terminal of WT CooA. Open table in a new tab c β-Galactosidase levels are expressed as a percent of that of WT CooA in the presence of CO. Initial in vivo analyses of these variants, using a CooA-dependent β-galactosidase reporter system, showed that these Pro2 region variants all retained CO-responsive CooA activity (Table I). Because the levels of WT CooA in the reporter strain are in excess of that necessary to fully saturate the reporter, CooA variants with poor accumulation but high specific activity are readily detected. By this assay, all Pro2 region variants examined have a high level of CO responsive activity. In contrast, CooA variants altered at His77 show virtually no response to CO, although some display a modest level of CO independent activity (TableI), which has been noted previously (17Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Some Pro2region variants accumulate much less well than does WT CooA based on heme spectra, and we assume that this reduced level of accumulation reflects heme instability. It is interesting that the Pro2region variants in Table I that accumulate best are those with an “extended” N terminus, resulting from the presumed retention of Met1; the retention of the terminal Met1 was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of purified P2Y CooA (data not shown). Variants at position 77 generally accumulate to fairly normal levels. In the FeII and FeII-CO forms, the Pro2 region variants studied displayed Soret absorbance maxima that were very similar to that of WT CooA (data not shown). However, in the FeIII spectrum of all of these variants there was an additional Soret maxima to approximately 388 nm, which suggests a mixture of normal WT-like six-coordinate, low-spin species (denoted by a Soret peak at ∼423 nm) and high-spin, five-coordinate species (denoted by a Soret peak at ∼388 nm); there was variation in the proportion of these two forms among the various Pro2region variants (Table I). This spectral feature is further described below with a purified protein. These results clearly indicate that, while Pro2 appears to be optimal for heme accumulation and activity, a wide variety of alterations of the N terminus allow significant accumulation of heme-containing protein and retention of CO responsive activity. The observation that CooA variants altered at either His77 or Pro2 display some fraction of six-coordinate, low-spin heme, suggests that at least one adventitious ligand is available on each side of the heme and this issue is discussed later. The site-directed mutagenesis results provide an insight into the requirements for the N terminus, but were necessarily limited to the analysis of a small number of changes. We therefore employed a different approach, which we term region randomization, in which a library of cooA-containing clones was created in which codons 2–6 (or, in a second analysis, codons 2–3) were completely randomized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Clones expressing CO-responsive CooA were screened for those that accumulated detectable levels of heme-containing CooA (based on cell pellet color compared with that of WT), and the cooA gene sequenced. In the randomization of codons 2–6, approximately 39,000 randomized clones were screened and 46 displayed a reasonable level of β-galactosidase in response to CO. These were screened for detectable heme accumulation and the five clones with readily detectable heme-containing CooA are shown in TableII. While screening 39,000 clones does not test all possible amino acid sequences when 5 codons are randomized, it does reveal positions where there are, or are not, strong selections for heme accumulation and CO-responsiveness. In the randomization of codons 2–3, a much smaller number of clones was screened to obtain those in Table II, but technical problems prevent an estimation of frequency.Table IIHeme accumulation and in vivo activity of selected 2–3 and 2–6 randomized CooA variantsN-terminal sequence2-aPredicted protein sequence of residues the N terminus.

In rabbit heart splice variant 1 (RH-1), exon 19 was deleted, which resulted in a reading frameshift of exon 20 with a premature termination codon and a novel 19-amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail. In the RH-2 variant, exons 17 and 18 were deleted, leading to a reading frameshift of exons 19 and 20 with a premature stop codon and a novel 62-amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail. RNase protection assays with RH-1 and RH-2 cRNA probes confirmed the expression in cardiac and neuronal tissue but not skeletal muscle. The deduced amino acid sequence from full-length cDNAs encoding the two variants predicted polypeptides of 99.0 and 99.2 kDa, which constituted domains I and II of the α1 subunit of the Cav1.2 channel. Antipeptide antibodies directed to sequences in the second intracellular loop between domains II and III identified the 240-kDa Cav1.2 subunit in sarcolemmal and heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum (HSR) membranes and a 99-kDa polypeptide in the HSR.

The α subunits of K+, Na+, and Ca2+ channels show overall structural similarity in that the α subunit of K+channels consists of a single domain, which is predicted to contain six membrane-spanning (S1–S6)1regions, whereas the structural unit of Na+ and Ca2+ channels consists of four such homologous domains (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Because the K+ channel genes encode only one domain, it is proposed that homo- and heterotetrameric co-assembly of single-domain K+ channel subunits is required to constitute the four-domain channel complexes (8Castellano A.

Moreover, dihydropyridine sensitivity of cardiac and vascular α1 subunits of Cav1.2 Ca2+channels may be attributed to tissue-specific expression of an alternatively spliced S6 segment of domain I of the Cav 1.2 gene (36Welling A.

Because the α1 subunit of Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels is expressed in tissues such as the myocardium and brain, which are composed of a heterogeneous population of cells, it has been postulated that alternatively spliced variants may be expressed to serve functions in a cell type-specific manner. In view of the functional importance of the loop II–III structure, we examined whether alternative splicing will result in the generation and expression of structural variants in this critical region. We report here the identification of two splice variants of Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels that generate truncated forms of the α1 subunits, which were predicted to constitute domains I and II with unique carboxyl-terminal tails. The expression of these variants in cardiac and neuronal tissue suggests that further diversity in Ca2+ channel function and regulation may be generated through alternative structural units. Total RNA was isolated using the TriPure reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to method described by Chomczynski (48Chomczynski P. Biotechniques. 1993; 15: 532-537PubMed Google Scholar). Adult rabbit heart, brain, and skeletal muscle were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was extracted in phenol thiocyanate. Total RNA (1.0 μg) was reverse transcribed with either a gene-specific primer, based on the sequence of the α1 subunit of the Cav 1.2 gene from rabbit myocardium described by Mikami et al. (Ref. 17Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar; primer JW6, GGTGAAGATCGTGTCGTTGAC, nt 2990–2970) or random hexamers and SuperScript reverse transcriptase. The first-strand cDNA synthesis with the gene-specific primer results in exclusive reverse transcription of the Cav 1.2 transcripts from rabbit myocardium, thus yielding increased sensitivity of the PCR amplification by increasing the representation of the rare messages. To amplify the Cav1.2 subunit loop II–III, the specific primers JW5 (GTGGACAACCTGGCTGATGCTGAG, nt 2538–2561) and JW6 were used. The PCR was performed under the following conditions: 94 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, repeated 30 times. There were two negative controls used, one with water to control for contamination of the master mix and a second control reaction that contained all reaction components except reverse transcriptase (i.e. RNA but no first-strand cDNA) to control for contamination from genomic DNA and partially processed mRNA. The PCR reaction was run in an MJ Research thermocycler. The products were analyzed by 1% gel electrophoresis, gel purified, and cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Twenty bacterial colonies were selected and screened by restriction mapping. Amplification of the loop II–III variant fragments encompassing the predicted stop codon at nucleotide 2995 of the Cav 1.2 gene used upstream and downstream primers anchored in transmembrane sequences encoding domains II and III of cardiac α1 subunit. The sense primer loop5′ (TCCTACTGAATGTGTTGG, nt 2509–2529) and antisense primer loop3′ (CAGGATG TTGAAGTAGTTC, nt 3199–3179) also incorporated BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively, to facilitate directional cloning of the PCR products into pTZ18 (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH). Similar to RT-PCR performed with JW5 and JW6 primers, synthesis of the first-strand cDNA was primed with a gene-specific antisense loop3′ oligonucleotide. The following cycling condition were used: 94 °C for 45 s, 52 °C for 35 s, and 72 °C for 35 s, repeated 32 times. The final elongation was performed at 72 °C for 10 min. The RT-PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel, gel purified, and subcloned into the pTZ18 vector. Sixty bacterial colonies were selected and screened by restriction mapping and direct sequencing. Recombinant clones of loop II–III RT-PCR amplicons subcloned into either pCRII or pTZ18 were selected and inoculated overnight at 37 °C in LB broth containing 75 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated using an alkaline miniprep (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The recombinant constructs were screened by restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis to identify loop II–III deletion variants. The various inserts were then purified with a Qiagen miniprep plasmid preparation method to obtain high-purity templates suitable for cycle sequencing with the Applied Biosystems Prism dye terminator cycle-sequencing method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the sequences were analyzed using SeqAidII tools (University of Kansas). Total RNA (1.0 μg) prepared as described above was reverse transcribed with antisense primer 5′-CAGGATGTTGAAGTAGTTC-3′ (nt 3199–3179) and SuperScript at 50 °C for 45 min. PCR amplification was carried out at standard conditions with sense primer 5′-TGGAAACTGACAATGCTTCGAGCC-3′ (nt 180–203) and 3′ antisense splice-specific primers 5′-ATCCTCTTCTCCTTGGCCTCCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGGCGGAACCTGTGGTTTCC-3′, with first denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 94 °C for 45 s, 70 °C for 35 s, 72 °C 2 min 30 s, which was repeated 32 times, and the final elongating at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR amplicons were electrophoresed on a 0.9% agarose gel, TA cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen), and cycle sequenced (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The RNase protection assay used two cRNA probes, RH-1 and RH-2, representing deletion variants of loop II–III lacking exon 19 and exons 17 and 18. The32P-radiolabeled deletion variant probes were generated by in vitro transcription using MAXIscript reagents (Ambion) with [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); 104 cpm of the respective RNA probe was hybridized with 15 μg of mRNA in a Hybspeed hybridization at 68 °C for 10 min followed by RNase digestion (RNase A/T1, 1:100) at 37 °C for 45 min. Reactions were inactivated by addition of inactivation-precipitation mix (Ambion) and ethanol precipitated. Pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of gel loading buffer and analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide-8m urea-1× Tris borate-EDTA vertical gel and subjected to autoradiography. The protected fragments appearing on the autoradiograms were quantified on a Kodak Science image analysis station. To assess relative expression of Cav 1.2 loop II–III variants, the intensities of protected fragments were size normalized and expressed as a ratio. Century RNA markers (Ambion) were used as molecular size standards. Affinity-purified antibodies directed against peptide sequences (KYTTKINMDDLQPSENEDKS) of the intracellular loop II–II of the Cav 1.2α1 subunit were generously provided by Dr. William Catterall. Polyclonal antibodies directed against the carboxyl-terminal sequences of RH-1 and RH-2 variants were raised in New Zealand White rabbits. The only unique amino acid sequence (TTGSASSVTVSSTTRSSPT) of the common 19-amino acid carboxyl terminus of RH-1 and RH-2 was found to be nonantigenic and gave no immune response. On the other hand, two peptide sequences, KRMRRSLRCLSAPALGHS and GHSPSCTLRRRPC, were selected to raise antibody 1929 selective for the RH-2 variant. The peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier protein via the carboxyl-terminal carboxyl group and used in six consecutive immunizations per each of the New Zealand White rabbits (Genosys). The antisera was collected in four bleeds per animal. The Na+/K+-ATPase antibodies were provided by Dr Kathleen Sweadner. Membrane fractions from rat myocardium were isolated by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation and characterized for the enrichment of markers for the sarcolemma (∼20-fold enrichment in Na+/K+-ATPase and adenylate cyclase activities) and heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum (∼10-fold enrichment in ryanodine receptors) as described (67Feher J.J. Davis M.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1991; 23: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, which were probed with affinity-purified antipeptide antibodies. The second intracellular loop connecting domains II and III of the α1 subunit of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is believed to reside at the cytoplasmic phase of the membrane and determines the mode of signal transduction in excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells (42Tanabe T.

Given the structural and functional importance of this region, we determined whether diversity in Ca2+channel structure can be created through alternative splicing in this region of the α1 subunit gene. The intracellular loop connecting domains II and III of Cav1.2 α1subunits was amplified from rabbit myocardium by RT-PCR using primers based on the cDNA sequence reported by Mikami et al.(17Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The first-strand cDNA synthesis was primed either with the Cav1.2 subunit-specific oligonucleotide JW6 (nt 2990–2970) or random hexamers. The purpose of priming with the gene-specific oligonucleotide was to increase representation of the rare messages of the Cav1.2 transcript family. The PCR amplification of loop II–III was then carried out with JW5 (nt 2538–2561) and JW6 (nt 2990–2970) primers and analyzed by 1% agarose electrophoresis (Fig.1 A). The PCR with the JW6 primer yielded a major 452-nt product as well as smaller diffuse fragments (Fig. 1A, lane 1), whereas PCR of the first-strand cDNA primed with random hexamers yielded a single fragment of 452 nt (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Fig.1 A, lane 2, represents a PCR-negative control. Subcloning and direct sequencing of the PCR products shown in lane 1 revealed that the 452-nt product matched perfectly the sequence of the intracellular loop linking domains II and III of the rabbit heart α1 Cav 1.2subunit gene, whereas that of the smaller diffuse fragment matched the 452-nt loop II–III sequence except for a deletion of 133 nt (from 2812 to 2945). Open reading frame analysis of the 320-nt amplicon containing the 133-nt deletion indicated that the deletion was predicted to shift the translational reading frame of full-length α1 Cav 1.2 and to introduce a premature chain termination at nt 2995 (data not shown). To obtain longer cDNAs encompassing the entire loop II–III and the predicted stop codon, RT-PCR was performed with another set of primers nested in the transmembrane segment S6 of domain II and S3 segment of domain III (loop 5′, nt 2509–2529; and loop 3′, nt 3199–3179, respectively). Primers were designed to contain BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites to facilitate subcloning and analysis of the PCR amplicons. Fig. 1B depicts RT-PCR of rabbit heart, where the first-strand cDNA was performed with the gene-specific antisense oligonucleotide loop 3′, and PCR amplification was carried out with loop 5′ and loop 3′ primers. Similar to RT-PCR analysis carried out with the JW5 and JW6 primers, amplification with the loop 5′ and loop 3′ primers produced two products, an amplicon of ∼700 nt and a lower band of ∼560 bp (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Moreover, the size difference between the top and bottom products was ∼ 140 nt, analogous to the RT-PCR performed with the JW5 and JW6 primers. After subcloning of the amplified products, three representative amplicons were characterized by restriction mapping and direct sequencing (Fig. 1C). Lane 1 shows the presence of a 690-nt product, representing the expected amplification product of α1 Cav 1.2 with the loop 5′ and loop 3′ primers, and lanes 2 and 3 represent two clones isolated and characterized from the lower RT-PCR amplification band. The nucleotide sequence analysis and alignment shown in Fig. 2 Aindicated that the 690-nt product represented the nucleotide sequence of the expected amplified fragment encompassing the wild-type intracellular loop II–III of Cav1.2 (Rab-H), whereas the smaller products denoted two distinct variants of this sequence. Variant 1, denoted RH-1, and variant 2, denoted RH-2, appear to be derived from the full-length loop II–III sequence spanned by the loop 5′ and loop 3′ primers, as a consequence of internal deletions of 133 and 130 nt, respectively. The RH-1 variant contained deletion of nt 2812–2945, and it represents a deletion variant already characterized in the RT-PCR analysis carried out with the JW5 and JW6 primers. The RH-2 variant displayed deletions of nt 2681–2811, and it represents a novel variant cloned from the smaller amplification product of loop II–III. Analysis of the open reading frame of the deletion variants RH-1 and RH-2 in relation to the wild-type sequence confirmed that both deletions shifted the open reading frame, thus introducing a common termination codon (TGA) at nucleotide 2995. The amino acid sequence alignment of the variants indicated that both variants introduce novel amino acid sequences past their respective deletions depicting novel carboxyl terminal sequences of the truncated polypeptides (Fig.2 B). Because both variants use the same stop codon, the terminal 19 amino acids were identical in the two variants. An independent isolation of the RH-1 and RH-2 cDNAs was obtained with RT-PCR of RNA from the whole heart and cardiac left ventricle but not skeletal muscle.Figure 2Ch"

In adult transgenic mice, mutation of the distal MCAT element led to significant reductions in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) specific activity measured in control soleus and plantaris muscles when compared with wild type transgene β293WT but did not abolish MOV-induced CAT specific activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed the formation of a specific low migrating nuclear protein complex (LMC) at the βMyHC MCAT element that was highly enriched only when using either MOV plantaris or control soleus nuclear extract. Scanning mutagenesis of the βMyHC distal MCAT element revealed that only the nucleotides comprising the core MCAT element were essential for LMC formation. The proteins within the LMC when using either MOV plantaris or control soleus nuclear extracts were antigenically related to nominal transcription enhancer factor 1 (NTEF-1), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and Max. Only in vitro translated TEF-1 protein bound to the distal MCAT element, suggesting that this multiprotein complex is tethered to the DNA via TEF-1. Protein-protein interaction assays revealed interactions between nominal TEF-1, PARP, and Max. Our studies show that for transgene β293 the distal MCAT element is not required for MOV responsiveness but suggest that a multiprotein complex likely comprised of nominal TEF-1, PARP, and Max forms at this element to contribute to basal slow fiber expression.

Once myofibers have differentiated and acquired a distinct adult phenotype, the molecular properties of the fiber are not static but instead are remarkably malleable in response to a broad spectrum of physiological signals (5Booth F.W. Baldwin K.M. Rowell L.B Shepherd J.T. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 1075-1123Google Scholar). A well documented example of this phenotypic plasticity is the induction of βMyHC expression in fast type II fibers in response to increased neuromuscular activity imposed by mechanical overload (MOV) (5Booth F.W.

The regulated control of βMyHC expression has been shown to involve the summation of inputs from multiple cis-acting modules located within both the βMyHC proximal promoter and more distal regulatory regions (3Knotts S.

However, the precise contribution of each discrete element comprising these regions has not been systematically analyzed in the in vivo context. In addition, the identity of the cell-specific and/or ubiquitous transcription factors that direct βMyHC slow fiber restricted expression or MOV responsiveness in adult stage skeletal muscle have not been determined as yet.To investigate the mechanistic basis controlling both slow fiber restricted expression and MOV responsiveness of the βMyHC gene, we have conducted an extensive in vivo deletion analysis of the human βMyHC promoter in the context of the transgenic mouse (4Wiedenman J.L.

These studies defined a minimal promoter region comprised of 293 bp of the βMyHC promoter (transgene β293WT) that closely mimics the expression pattern of the endogenous βMyHC gene at all developmental stages, and in response to MOV (4Wiedenman J.L.

Most striking was the finding that the deletion of an 89-bp region (−293 to −205) resulted in the loss of transgene β293WT expression and MOV responsiveness, thus indicating that this 89-bp region contains regulatory elements important for both basal slow fiber expression and MOV responsiveness of the βMyHC gene (9McCarthy J.J. Vyas D.R. Tsika G.L. Tsika R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14270-14279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Further analysis of this 89-bp region led to the identification of a putative MOV element (βA/T-rich element: −269 to −258) that formed an enriched multiprotein binding complex only when MOV-plantaris nuclear extract was used (8Vyas D.R. McCarthy J.J. Tsika R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30832-30842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition to this A/T-rich element, the 89-bp region also contains a muscle CAT (MCAT) site. Whether this regulatory element plays a functional role in conferring βMyHC basal slow fiber expression and/or MOV responsiveness has not been investigated as yet.MCAT regulatory elements (5′-CATTCCT-3′) are similar in nucleotide sequence to the SV40 enhancer GT-IIC (5′-CATTCCA-3′),SphI (5′-CATGCCT-3′, and SphII (5′-CATACCT-3′) elements (12Jacquemin P.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 307-329Crossref Google Scholar). Earlier studies using protein purification and cDNA cloning identified transcription enhancer factor 1 (TEF-1) as the GT-IIC protein binding activity within HeLa cell extracts (14Davidson I.

Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have established the presence of a multigene TEF-1 family in vertebrates (nominal TEF-1 (NTEF-1), related TEF-1 (RTEF-1), divergent TEF-1, and embryonic TEF-1). Further diversity within the TEF-1 family of transcription factors is accomplished by alternative splicing (12Jacquemin P. Davidson I. Trends Cardiovasc.

A detailed molecular analysis of the cTnT promoter has elucidated the mechanistic basis by which two closely positioned MCAT elements participate in directing embryonic skeletal muscle-specific gene transcription of the cTnT gene (20Larkin S.B.

These two MCAT elements (MCAT1 and MCAT2) bind several protein complexes that display high, intermediate, and low migrating mobility in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). All binding complexes contain TEF-1 protein; however, the low mobility complex (LMC) formed at the MCAT1 element contains an additional protein identified as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (20Larkin S.B.

Mutation of the 5′-flanking nucleotides of either the MCAT1 or MCAT2 elements revealed their integral requirement for achieving both skeletal muscle-specific expression of cTnT reporter genes, and the formation of a LMC at these MCAT elements when using embryonic chicken skeletal muscle nuclear extract (20Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3742-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Likewise, Gupta et al. (23Gupta M.P. Amin C.S. Gupta M. Hay N. Zak R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3924-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the positive regulation of αMyHC gene expression in cardiomyocytes requires an E-box/MCAT composite element that involves the cobinding of NTEF-1 and the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor Max. Additionally, Ojamaa et al. (24Ojamaa K. Samarel A.M. Klein I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31276-31281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the αMyHC E-box/MCAT element can serve as a contractile/mechanical responsive element in cardiomyocytes and under conditions of increased contractile activity binds the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein, upstream stimulatory factor (USF).The βMyHC gene is regulated by mechanical stimuli and contains within its proximal promoter two closely spaced MCAT elements; a distal MCAT (−290/−284) and a proximal MCAT (−210/−203). These two distinct MCAT elements are highly conserved and located within a region required for both slow fiber expression and MOV responsiveness of a 293-bp human βMyHC transgene (β293) in adult skeletal muscle (4Wiedenman J.L. Tsika G.L. Gao L. McCarthy J.J. Rivera-Rivera I.D. Vyas D. Sheriff-Carter K. Tsika R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: R688-R695PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous EMSA analysis revealed that only the distal MCAT element formed a series of protein complexes displaying low, intermediate, and high migrating mobility similar to those formed at the cTnT MCAT element, and in addition, the low mobility complex was enriched only when using MOV-P nuclear extract (25Vyas D.R. McCarthy J.J. Tsika G.L. Tsika R.W. Basic Appl. Myol. 2000; 10: 5-16Google Scholar). On the basis of these data obvious questions arise. First, does the distal MCAT element (−293/−284) bind both TEF-1 and PARP? Second, does this element contribute to both basal slow fiber expression and MOV responsiveness of the minimal 293-bp human βMyHC transgene?In the current study we have generated multiple independent transgenic mouse lines harboring either a wild type 293-bp human βMyHC transgene (β293WT) or a 293-bp MCAT element mutant transgene (β293Mm). These mice were used in studies aimed at determining whether the distal MCAT element is required for: 1) basal slow fiber expression, 2) muscle-specific expression, and 3) MOV responsiveness. We also conducted a detailed molecular analysis to determine what nuclear protein(s) comprise the low mobility binding complex formed at the distal MCAT element. Our findings show that the βMyHC distal MCAT element contributes to basal slow fiber expression of transgene β293 but is not required for MOV-responsive expression of transgene β293 in adult transgenic mice. The multiprotein complex formed at the βMyHC distal MCAT element is comprised of NTEF-1, PARP, and Max. DNA binding studies indicate that PARP and Max are bound to the distal MCAT element via TEF-1, whereas protein-protein interaction assays revealed that these three proteins physically interact in vitro. Collectively, these data support the notion that the assembly of TEF-1, PARP, and Max at the βMyHC distal MCAT element (LMC) contributes to basal slow fiber expression of transgene β293 in adult stage skeletal muscle.DISCUSSIONMCAT elements are known to participate in directing muscle-specific expression. Our transgenic findings herein show that the control region distal MCAT element (−290/−284) contributes significantly to basal slow muscle expression of chromosomally integrated transgene β293 but is not absolutely required for MOV responsiveness. Furthermore, our in vivo protein-protein interaction studies elucidate the possibility that in adult skeletal muscle NTEF-1, PARP, and Max may physically interact to form a ternary binding complex at the βMyHC distal MCAT element.Transgenic Mouse Analyses of the in Vivo Function of the Human βMyHC Distal MCAT Element Reveals That It Contributes to Basal Slow Fiber Expression but Is Not Absolutely Required for MOV ResponsivenessIn adult mice, basal expression levels of the endogenous βMyHC gene is high in the slow twitch soleus muscle, whereas it is not expressed to any appreciable degree in the fast twitch plantaris muscle, an expression pattern mimicked by wild type transgene β293WT (4Wiedenman J.L. Tsika G.L. Gao L. McCarthy J.J. Rivera-Rivera I.D. Vyas D. Sheriff-Carter K. Tsika R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: R688-R695PubMed Google Scholar, 9McCarthy J.J. Vyas D.R. Tsika G.L. Tsika R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14270-14279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our analysis of mutant transgene β293Mm basal expression revealed that mutation of the distal MCAT element significantly decreased but did not abolish expression in the slow twitch soleus muscle (Fig. 2, A and B, and TableII). In fact, even though the magnitude of mutant transgene β293Mm expression was decreased, its expression pattern (soleus > plantaris) still mirrored that of wild type transgene β293WT. These results showing low, yet persistent expression of mutant transgene β293Mm strongly suggest that other cis-acting elements within the 293-bp human βMyHC basal promoter must be acting in concert to preserve wild type levels of slow muscle expression. Candidate sites within the βMyHC proximal control region (−293/−170) that may act in combination with the distal MCAT element to direct high levels of slow muscle expression are an A/T-rich (−269/−258), CCAC/Sp1 (C-rich, −242/−231), and NFAT (−179/−171). In this regard, our results from EMSA and transgenic mouse analysis indicate that the βMyHC NFAT and βA/T-rich elements contribute to slow muscle expression because their independent mutation in the context of transgene β293 (β293Nm, β293A/Tm) significantly decreased slow muscle expression. 2G. L. Tsika and R. W. Tsika, unpublished observation. Our data provide evidence that the combined inputs from the distal MCAT, βA/T-rich, and βNFAT elements underlie transgene β293WT slow muscle gene expression in adult transgenic mice. Indirect support for this notion comes from recent findings implicating NFAT and MEF2 proteins as downstream mediators of calcium-activated intracellular signaling pathways that have been proposed to regulate the slow gene program (Ref. 39Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar and references within). Additional work is underway to clarify whether these three elements collaborate to direct slow muscle specific expression.Because MCAT elements have been shown to function as inducible promoter elements in response to mechanical stimuli (13)y and the distal MCAT element resides within the 89-bp region required for MOV responsiveness of transgene β293WT, we investigated its role in MOV-inducible expression. Our analysis revealed that the range of MOV-induced CAT specific activity measured in the MOV-P muscle of mice harboring mutant transgene β293Mm was almost identical to those carrying wild type transgene β293WT, indicating that the distal MCAT element is not absolutely required for MOV responsiveness of transgene β293 (TableII). Although MOV induction could still be achieved when the distal MCAT element was mutated (β293Mm), this element still appears to be necessary to achieve high levels of transgene β293 induction in response to MOV (Table II), implicating the requirement for additional element(s). In support of this notion, we have recently identified by EMSA analysis a putative MOV element (A/T-rich element (−269/−258)) that demonstrates enriched binding of two unidentified nuclear proteins (44 and 48 kDa) only under MOV conditions (8Vyas D.R. McCarthy J.J. Tsika R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30832-30842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus the βA/T-rich and distal MCAT elements may participate collaboratively to confer MOV responsiveness to transgene β293, a study currently under investigation.In addition to our mutant MCAT transgenic findings, our EMSA analysis provides supportive evidence that the distal MCAT element contributes to slow fiber expression in the control soleus and MOV-P muscle. In direct and competition EMSA experiments we observed the formation of a specific LMC that varied in intensity according to the proportion of slow type I fibers within the adult stage rat skeletal muscles from which nuclear extract was isolated (Fig. 3). This EMSA binding pattern (CP < MOV-P < CS) is relevant to the in vivoexpression pattern of our transgenes because the mouse and rat display a qualitatively similar pattern of slow type I fibers within these muscles.Mutant Transgene β293Mm Does Not Display a Loss of Muscle Specific ExpressionPrevious studies by Rindt et al.(7Rindt H. Gulick J. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that mutation of the distal MCAT element within a 600-bp mouse βMyHC promoter (β0.6MCAT) led to the loss of muscle specific expression (7Rindt H. Gulick J. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Regardless of the aforementioned findings, we did not detect measurable levels of transgene β293Mm in any nonmuscle tissue examined (data not shown). Several explanations may account for these different observations. First, the loss of mouse βMyHC transgene β0.6MCAT muscle specific expression was examined in only one transgenic line; therefore, this result may reflect chromosomal integration site effects as opposed to the loss of promoter regulation. Second, the levels of human transgene β293Mm studied herein are on average lower than those of mouse transgene β0.6MCAT, which may have resulted in our missing possible aberrant (nonmuscle) expression. Last, our mutation was restricted to a 5-nucleotide substitution within the core MCAT element, whereas the mutation within mouse transgene β0.6MCAT involved substitution of 19 nucleotides that spanned the core MCAT as well as both 5′ and 3′ regions (7Rindt H. Gulick J. Robbins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on the findings of Larkin et al. (20Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3742-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) concerning the requirement of the MCAT 5′-flanking nucleotides to achieve cTnT muscle specific gene expression, it is reasonable to suggest that mutation of the immediate 5′-flanking region may have altered muscle specific expression.The βMyHC Distal MCAT LMC Is a Multiprotein Complex and Is Likely Comprised of TEF-1, PARP, and MaxBecause of the relevance of previous findings showing physical interactions between NTEF-1 and Max (23Gupta M.P. Amin C.S. Gupta M. Hay N. Zak R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3924-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as RTEF-1 and PARP (22Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), it was important that we determine whether these same proteins comprise the LMC that forms at the βMyHC distal MCAT element when using adult stage MOV-P or soleus nuclear extract. Our EMSA and protein-protein interaction assays provide multiple lines of evidence that TEF-1, PARP, and Max most likely comprise a ternary protein complex that binds the βMyHC distal MCAT element to form the LMC. First, EMSA analysis revealed the formation of a LMC with a mobility that resembled the LMC formed at the cTnT element (Fig. 3). Second, in competition EMSAs, oligonucleotides containing either the αMyHC E-box/MCAT site or the cTnT MCAT1 element abolished the formation of most but importantly not all of the LMC formed at the βMyHC distal MCAT element. This is most apparent when using CS nuclear extract (Fig. 4, lane 13). Alternatively, these findings might also suggest that the proteins comprising the LMC at these three different MCAT elements may be the same but reflect differences in binding affinity. Third, the use of polyclonal anti-NTEF-1, PARP and Max, antibodies revealed that the LMC contained proteins antigenically related to TEF-1, PARP, and Max (Fig. 6). Fourth, our in vitro protein-protein interaction assays show that NTEF-1, PARP, and Max all physically interact with each other (Fig. 7). Alternatively, when considering the third and fourth issues above, it remains possible that two different populations of LMC exists in the form of TEF-1/PARP and TEF-1/Max. Although this is possible, it seems unlikely because there would be a difference of approximately 100-kDa between these two distinct LMCs. For example, a PARP (120–140 kDa)/TEF-1 (54 kDa) protein complex would have a mass of 174–194 kDa, whereas a TEF-1/Max (22 kDa) protein complex would have a mass of 76 kDa. This 100–120 kDa difference in mass would likely be resolved in our EMSA assays. Last, in DNA binding assays, our experiments reveal that of the three proteins tested, only in vitro synthesized TEF-1 isoproteins bind to the βMyHC distal MCAT element (Fig.8 A), indicating that the putative ternary protein complex is tethered to this element via TEF-1 DNA-protein binding.Despite the fact that some of the nuclear proteins that interact at the βMyHC, cTnT, and αMyHC MCAT elements are the same, our experiments show that the DNA binding properties of the βMyHC distal MCAT element differ, possibly explaining why Max and PARP did not bind this element. This important distinction is supported by differences in footprint patterns obtained for the βMyHC, cTnT, and αMyHC MCAT elements. Our footprint analysis (25Vyas D.R. McCarthy J.J. Tsika G.L. Tsika R.W. Basic Appl. Myol. 2000; 10: 5-16Google Scholar) in conjunction with our current scanning mutagenesis results provide evidence that strong DNA-protein interactions occurred throughout the core MCAT element with weaker interactions in the flanking regions (Fig. 5). In contrast, similar analysis of the cTnT MCAT1 element revealed strong DNA-protein interactions occurring at the 5′-flanking nucleotides, the proposed site (5′-TGTTG-3′) of PARP binding that is conspicuously absent from the βMyHC distal MCAT oligonucleotide (Refs. 20Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3742-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and 22Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar and Table I). Likewise, analysis of the αMyHC E-box/MCAT hybrid element revealed strong DNA-protein interactions spanning the 5′-flanking nucleotides containing the high affinity Max target binding site (CACGTG) that is also absent from the βMyHC distal MCAT oligonucleotide (Ref. 40Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Zak R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29677-29687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Table I). The lack of Max DNA binding to our MCAT element was not completely unexpected because Max was identified as a neonatal cardiomyocyte nuclear protein component of a binding complex that formed at a cTnT core MCAT oligonucleotide devoid of an E-box element (23Gupta M.P. Amin C.S. Gupta M. Hay N. Zak R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3924-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, this same oligonucleotide was shown"

The CHOP/GADD153 gene was originally cloned because of its inducibility by ultraviolet light wavelength band C (UVC) and has since been found to be activated in response to many different cellular stresses. Some of the recent studies have questioned the UVC responsiveness of the CHOP gene. Contradiction in our own data led us to reexamine the UVC effects on CHOP expression. UVC is capable of strongly activating the mouse CHOP promoter in stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells but has only a modest and transient effect on the level of the CHOP messenger RNA. In addition to its positive effect on CHOP promoter activity, we show that UVC negatively affects CHOP mRNA and protein expression. Pretreatment of NIH 3T3 cells with UVC markedly attenuates the subsequent induction of CHOP mRNA by the cellular stress activators methylmethane sulfate, tunicamycin, glucose deprivation, and methionine deprivation for as long as at least 16 h. This inhibitory effect of UVC on CHOP expression in response to stress is independent of the presence or absence of p53 and does not involve mRNA degradation as opposed to the UVC effect that inhibits p21 expression seen only in the absence of p53. The target of the inhibitory effect of UVC on CHOP expression is located in the first exon of the gene, a 5′-untranslated region that is unusually conserved between different species. These findings suggest that an unknown function encoded by the 5′-untranslated region somehow modifies the response of CHOP gene transcription to UVC.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mitogen-activated protein methylmethane sulfonate ultraviolet light wavelength band C human immunodeficiency virus Cells of unicellular or multicellular organisms have adapted to live and propagate in ways determined by their genetic makeup and by the environmental cues received. Perturbations or adverse conditions that place cells in danger trigger the stress response: an ensemble of changes in cellular physiology including the rapid alteration of expression of specific genes. Although many of these changes have not been functionally characterized, they most probably participate in mechanisms such as adaptation, protection, damage assessment, repair, and cellular death if the damage places the rest of the organism at risk. CHOP (C/EBP homology protein, also called GADD 153 (growth arrest DNAdamage 153)) is a basic region leucine zipper transcription factor and heterodimerizes with members of the C/EBP1 family of transcription factors (1Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). The expression of CHOP is markedly induced by a variety of cellular stresses. The dimerization of CHOP with C/EBPβ inhibits the function of the latter by preventing DNA binding to a C/EBP site in the promoters of a subset of genes. In addition, CHOP/C/EBP heterodimer binds to a different DNA sequence of another subset of genes (2Ubeda M. Wang X.Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulates the transcription of these genes (3Wang X.Z. Kuroda M. Sok J. Batchvarova N. Kimmel R. Chung P. Zinszner H. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). CHOP also heterodimerizes with other non-C/EBP subfamilies of basic region leucine zipper proteins, e.g. activating transcription factor 3 (4Chen B.P. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and Jun/Fos (5Ubeda M. Vallejo M. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7589-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several functions have been proposed for CHOP. Heterotopic overexpression of CHOP induces growth arrest in fibroblasts (6Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabaee A. Philipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), inhibits adipocyte differentiation (7Batchvarova N. Wang X.Z. Ron D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4654-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and induces apoptosis in vitro (8Matsumoto M. Minami M. Takeda K. Sakao Y. Akira S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Studies in CHOP knockout mice also suggest a role for CHOP in apoptosis during the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in kidney cells (9Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). CHOP (GADD 153) was first identified based on the finding that it was expressed in response to growth arrest and DNA damage (10Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The expression of CHOP has subsequently been shown to be induced by many other cellular stresses such as amino acid deprivation (11Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J.

These findings have also questioned the initially observed growth arrest and DNA damage inducibility of CHOP. Glucose or amino acid limitation could have been the inducers in the initial growth arrest studies (10Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Also, DNA damaging agents are known to not only target DNA but other molecules in the cell as well. Therefore, the signals that promote CHOP gene expression may not be DNA damageper se (16Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The response of CHOP expression to UVC irradiation is representative of the contradictions in the literature. CHOP was first isolated as GADD153 because of its inducibility by UVC radiation (10Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1819-1827PubMed Google Scholar). These discrepancies could reflect differences in cell type, mode of treatment, or culture conditions. We have cloned the promoter region of the mouse CHOP gene. Promoter-CAT constructs stably integrated in the genome show strong UV responsiveness, whereas endogenous CHOP mRNA or protein do not. A closer analysis reveals that UVC acts in a dual and antagonist way on CHOP expression. Here we describe studies that implicate the first exon of the CHOP gene as a novel and critical UVC-responsive modulator of the responsivity of the expression of CHOP to cellular stress. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The p53 +/+ and p53 −/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (26Jacks T. Remington L. Williams B.O. Schmitt E.M. Halachmi S. Bronson R.T. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar) were cultured under the same conditions except that serum was 10% fetal bovine. For induction experiments cells were split the day before at a density of about 2–4 × 105 cells/5-cm dish. Cells were always subconfluent during the course of the experiments. Tunicamycin (Sigma) was resuspended in 90% ethanol, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 9, at 2 mg/ml and used at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Methylmethane sulfate (MMS; Aldrich) treatment was performed at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) devoid of glucose or methionine was used for the depletion experiments, serum was 10% normal calf serum. The cell monolayer was washed several times with the depleted medium before incubation. NIH 3T3 cells were irradiated with UVC for 5 s after removal of medium and one wash with phosphate-buffered saline with a UVC (254 nm) germicidal lamp, 6.3 J/m2/s. For mRNA stability studies transcription was blocked with actinomycin D (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. The CHOP promoter-CAT reporter constructs used in this study were generated by cloning polymerase chain reaction amplified mouse CHOP promoter fragments in the pBLCAT3 vector (27Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The template for the polymerase chain reaction was a CHOP genomic clone isolated by screening a mouse (129 Sv) genomic library (Stratagene) made of partially Sau 3A digested DNA with a probe encompassing the mouse exon 2, exon 3, and part of exon 4. The 5′ upstream regulatory region of the CHOP gene obtained was 2.5 kilobases. 2M. Schmitt-Ney, unpublished results. For preparation of construct −980/+19 and −318/+19 the forward primers were 5′-CGAGTCGACTGTGTTTCCTCTGATGACCCAGT-3′ and 5′-CGAGTCGACGGTTGCCAAACATTGCATCAT-3′, respectively. For both constructs the reverse primer was 5′-CGAGGATCCTGTTAGGCTCAAGATAACTGACCT-3′. For the exon 1 containing construct −318/+95 the reverse primer was 5′-CGCGGATCCTCTCTCCTCAGGTTCCGGCTGTTAT-3′. Pools of stably transfected cells were prepared as follows. NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with 10 μg of promoter-CAT reporter construct and 2 μg of puromycin-resistant plasmid pPGKPuro (a gift of Peter W. Laird) with the calcium phosphate precipitation technique using a reagent kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Selection of puromycin-resistant colonies was performed with 1.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Pools of at least 40 colonies were used for induction and CAT assay. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40 containing 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis extracts were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (DuPont). Antibody for p53 was from Santa Cruz (Pab 240). For CHOP a polyclonal antibody was used (1Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were revealed by ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was extracted by using trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was size fractionated on an 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. After transfer to a Magna Charge nylon membrane (Micron Separation Inc.), UV treatment, and baking, the prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 0.1% SDS, and 5× Denhart's solution. Probe was labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming reaction. For quantification, blots were scanned with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and data were analyzed with IMAGEQUANT software. For CAT assay cells were resuspended in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. After heat inactivation at 65 °C for 10 min, the extracts were cleared by centrifugation. CAT assay was performed using a fluorescent chloramphenicol substrate FAST CAT (Molecular Probes, Inc.). After chromatography, plates were analyzed using a fluorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Quantification was performed with IMAGEQUANT software. We isolated a mouse CHOP genomic clone from which we prepared CHOP promoter-CAT reporter constructs. The reporter constructs were stably introduced into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts by cotransfection with a plasmid encoding puromycin resistance. Pools of puromycin-resistant colonies were challenged with different stresses known to induce CHOP expression. The mouse promoter (−980/+19) behaves very similarly to what is known from studies of the hamster promoter (−778/+21) (21Luethy J.D. Fargnoli J. Park J.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16521-16526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Luethy J.D. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5-10PubMed Google Scholar). Strong activation of the promoter in response to MMS, actinomycin D (data not shown), or UVC was observed. Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation and endoplasmic reticulum function, is also a strong inducer of CHOP expression (2Ubeda M. Wang X.Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3814-3817PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H.

We show that the induction of CHOP by tunicamycin is mediated by the CHOP −980/+19 promoter (Fig. 1 A). As a control the thymidine kinase promoter activity does not change upon treatment with UVC or tunicamycin (Fig. 1 A). Under the same stress conditions that stimulate CHOP promoter activity, we also examined endogenous levels of CHOP mRNA and proteins (Fig. 1,B and C). MMS and tunicamycin show the expected induction of both mRNA and protein levels, in accordance with the promoter data. Following UVC treatment, however, no changes in CHOP mRNA and protein levels are seen at 4 or 24 h. A substantial increase in p53 protein level is seen, demonstrating the effectiveness of the UVC treatment (Fig. 1 B). The absence of CHOP induction by UVC is in contradiction with our promoter data obtained using the same cell line and same treatment conditions. One possible explanation is that UVC induces CHOP gene transcription in a transient manner, such that at the time points we examined (4 and 24 h) the mRNA and protein levels are either not yet induced or have already returned to the non-induced level. The high stability of the CAT protein on the other hand may have allowed its accumulation and detection even long after the promoter is in the induction state. To explore this hypothesis, we examined CHOP mRNA levels at more frequent time intervals (Fig. 2). A rapid but modest elevation of CHOP mRNA is observed as early as 5 min after UVC exposure (2.5-fold above control). The induction of CHOP mRNA peaks at 1 h (4.5-fold above control) and decreases after 1 h, reaching control levels at 3 h. This modest increase in CHOP mRNA levels, however, does not correspond to the large increase in the activity of the CHOP promoter-CAT reporter activity observed in response to UVC. This discrepancy could be explained by a dual action of UVC on CHOP expression: a positive action on the CHOP promoter activity (as revealed by our construct) and a negative action (acting on transcription initiation, elongation, or RNA stability) that counteracts the promoter activity and consequently attenuates the induction of expression. If so, this hypothesis would predict that UVC may inhibit the induction of CHOP expression by other inducers of cellular stress. This hypothesis was explored. UVC treatment performed 1 h or 30, 15, or only 5 min (lanes 6, 5,4, and 3, respectively) prior to MMS treatment significantly inhibits the strong induction of CHOP expression observed with MMS treatment alone (lane 2 and control level of CHOP mRNA, lane 1) (Fig. 3). This effect of UVC is long lasting, because 16 h after UVC treatment cells that were challenged with MMS show no or very little induction of CHOP mRNA or protein levels (Fig. 3 B). This inhibition by UVC of CHOP induction is not restricted to MMS induction, because the induction of CHOP in response to tunicamycin, glucose deprivation, or methionine deprivation is also inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with UVC (Fig. 4).Figure 3Pretreatment of cells with UVC inhibits the induction of CHOP mRNA by treatment with MMS. A, NIH 3T3 cells were irradiated with UVC (30 J/m2), except cells from lanes 1 and 2. At the times indicated after pretreatment with UVC (30 J/m2), cells were treated with MMS (50 μg/ml) for an additional 3 h (except for controllane 1). Total RNA was then prepared. After electrophoresis and blotting, the CHOP mRNA was detected by hybridization with a32P-labeled probe. B, NIH 3T3 cells were irradiated (lanes 2 and 3) or not (lanes 1 and 4) with UVC (30 J/m2). 16 h later cells were treated with MMS (50 μg/ml) for 4 h (lanes 3 and 4) or not treated (lanes 1 and 2). All the cells were harvested at the same time for the preparation of protein and RNA. Protein extracts were subject to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, CHOP protein was detected with specific antiserum and revealed with ECL. Total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis. After blotting the CHOP RNA was detected by hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4The action of diverse CHOP inducers is inhibited by UVC. NIH 3T3 cells were irradiated (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) with UVC (30 J/m2) or not irradiated (lanes 1,3, 5, 7, and 9). 5 min later cells were treated as indicated with MMS (50 μg/ml) for 4 h, tunicamycin (TUN, 10 μg/ml) for 4 h, medium without glucose for 6 h, or medium without methionine for 6 h.

(28Gorospe M. Wang X. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have analyzed in detail the p53-dependent elevation of p21 expression in response to UV light. The study showed that in the absence of p53 not only did induction of p21 by UVC not occur, but that the induction of p21 by mimosine (which occurs independently of p53) is suppressed by UVC. The study showed that p21 mRNA degradation was the mechanism by which p21 expression was suppressed. The effect of UVC that we observed in our studies here is reminiscent of what was described for p21. The NIH 3T3 fibroblasts used in our studies have been reported to be mutated in the p53 gene (29Denko N.C. Giaccia A.J. Stringer J.R. Stambrook P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5124-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the inhibitory effect of UVC on CHOP expression is dependent on the presence of a functional p53 protein and whether CHOP mRNA degradation is involved. We find that UVC inhibition of CHOP expression occurs independently of p53 because it is observed in both p53 +/+ and p53 −/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 5). We then analyzed the effect of UVC on the stability of the CHOP mRNA. Cells treated with tunicamycin during 4 h with or without receiving a UVC pretreatment were subjected to a block in transcription by actinomycin D. The fate of the CHOP mRNA was analyzed at different times (Fig. 6). As expected, the level of CHOP mRNA is reduced in cells pretreated with UVC. However, the stability of the CHOP mRNA is not affected by UVC. On the contrary, the decay of the CHOP mRNA is slightly more rapid in the cells that were not exposed to UVC. Based on the results of our studies, suppression of CHOP and p21 expression by UVC appear to involve different mechanisms.Figure 6UVC does not decrease CHOP mRNA stability. NIH 3T3 cells were irradiated with UVC (30 J/m2) or not irradiated as indicated. 5 min later cells were treated with tunicamycin (TUN, 10 μg/ml) for 3.5 h. Transcription was then blocked with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Cells were harvested at the time indicated for total RNA preparation.A, after electrophoresis and blotting, the CHOP mRNA was detected by hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe.B, plot of CHOP mRNA levels versus time shown in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because of the remarkably high evolutionary conservation of the 5′-untranslated first exon of the human, hamster, rat, and mouse CHOP genes (Fig. 7), we examined the first exon (exon 1) of the mouse CHOP gene as a potential cause of the UVC inhibitory effects on the stress-mediated inducibility of CHOP gene expression. Remarkably, we found that the inclusion of the exon 1 sequence in the CHOP promoter in the context of the CHOP promoter-CAT reporter constructs (see Fig. 7 for map of the constructs used) markedly impaired its activation in response to UVC (3.5-fold induction) compared with reporter constructs lacking exon 1 (53-fold induction) (Fig. 8 A). Moreover, this marked inhibitory effect of the exon 1 sequence on the UVC induction of CHOP promoter activity appears to be unique to UVC because induction by tunicamycin of the promoter activity in the presence (228-fold induction) or the absence (145-fold induction) of exon 1 is essentially unaltered.Figure 8The first exon of the CHOP gene alters the response of the promoter to UVC light. A, pools of NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with the mouse CHOP promoter (−318/+19) or the mouse CHOP promoter and exon 1 (−318/+98) linked to the CAT reporter gene were treated with UVC (30 J/m2) or tunicamycin (10 μg/ml). Cells were harvested 6 h later. Extracts were prepared, and CAT activity was estimated by using a fluorescent chloramphenicol substrate. Fold induction in CAT activity compared with the untreated cells are shown. The results shown are from three independent experiments obtained from two different pools for each of the two constructs. B, pools of NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with the mouse CHOP promoter (−318/+19) or the mouse CHOP promoter and exon 1 (−318/+98) linked to the CAT reporter gene were treated with tunicamycin (10 μg/ml) alone or with UVC (30 J/m2) and tunicamycin (10 μg/ml). Cells were harvested at the indicated time. Extracts were prepared, and CAT activity was estimated by using a fluorescent chloramphenicol substrate. Fold induction in CAT activity compared with the untreated cells are shown. The results shown are from two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Thus, the behavior of the activations of the CHOP promoter constructs with exon 1 by UVC compared with tunicamycin and MMS mimics the effects of these stimuli on the activation of the endogenous CHOP gene (Figs. 1, B and C, and 2). Based on these findings we next investigated the effects of the pretreatment of NIH cells, expressing CHOP promoter reporters with and without exon 1, with UVC on subsequent responses to the stress-inducing agent tunicamycin. Surprisingly, an exposure of the cells to UVC inhibits the induction of CHOP gene expression by tunicamycin for at least 16–20 h (Fig. 8 B). That the inhibition of CAT activity is not due to UVC toxicity is shown by the robust induction of the CHOP promoter without exon 1 16 h after UVC treatment (Fig. 8 B). The UV stress response is an ensemble of changes in gene and protein expression occurring in cells irradiated with UV light (30Tyrrell R.M. Exs. 1996; 77: 255-271PubMed Google Scholar, 31Herrlich P. Blattner C. Knebel A. Bender K. Rahmsdorf H.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1217-1229PubMed Google Scholar). DNA damage has been the initial main focus of studies on UV action. The short wavelength component of UV light, UVC, has been used extensively as a source of genotoxic stress. In fact DNA damage was shown to be one of the initial signals in two important pathways induced by UVC: the p53 (32Yamaizumi M. Sugano T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2775-2784PubMed Google Scholar) and the NFκB (33Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Other DNA damage-dependent pathways leading to the production of secreted factors have been described (34Yarosh D.B. Alas L.

Blattner C. Knebel A. Bender K. Rahmsdorf H.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1217-1229PubMed Google Scholar). It is absorbed by other biomolecules in the cell, like proteins and lipids.

https://openalex.org/W1972480601,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein functions as an activator and also as a repressor of gene transcription. Currently, the mechanism of transcriptional repression by p53 remains poorly understood. To help clarify this mechanism, we carried out studies designed to identify the minimal repression domain that inhibits p53 transcriptional activities. We found only eight amino acids (339) of the COOH-terminal domain (termed P53MRD) that possess activities of repression. The exact location of this minimal domain is on the E6-binding region, and it lacks the ability of tetramerization. P53MRD is able to repress the transcription of p53 while not affecting VP16. The mutants (amino acids M340P and F341D) of native p53 also lost transcriptional repression of the thymidine kinase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase promoter. These results suggest that this eight-amino acid element is required for the repression of p53."

Our data are in agreement with the recent observation that Fuc-TV transfers more rapidly to the inner than the distal LN unit of LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3R (49Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Kaneko M. Tawada A. Ito M.

Even in the terminally α3-sialylated polylactosamine Neu5Acα23′LNβ1–3′LN, the reducing end LN unit reacted quite rapidly in the present experiments, whereas the distal (sialyl)LN group reacted very slowly. Koeller and Wong (50Koeller K.M. Wong C.H. Chem.-Eur. J. 2000; 6: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported recently that recombinant soluble Fuc-TV transferred to Neu5Acα2–3′LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3′LNβ1-O-allyl only two fucosyl units at undetermined positions. In view of the slow reactivity of the distal sialylated LN unit in Glycans 26 and30 in the present experiments (cf. Table III), it is probable that the Fuc-TV-generated product of Koeller and Wong represented mainly Neu5Acα2–3′LNβ1–3′Lexβ1–3′Lexβ1-O-allyl.The present experiments were performed using 1–5 millimolar acceptor concentrations, about 1 order of magnitude smaller than theKm reported for LN by Murray et al.

Accordingly, both Km and kcateffects may be responsible for the activity differences between different acceptors observed in our experiments. Several other α3-Fuc-Ts such as Fuc-TIV (22Niemelä R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12662-12671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are known to work well with LN units of i-type polylactosamines. However, the present data reveal major differences between Fuc-TV and the other human Fuc-Ts working on polylactosamines. Whereas the Fuc-TV reactivities of LN units are strongly influenced by the presence or absence of neighboring GlcNAc, Gal, and LN units in i-type chains, this is not the case for the analogous Fuc-TIV reactivities (22Niemelä R. Natunen J. Majuri M.L., P, M. Lowe J. Renkonen O. Renkonen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Another striking difference is provided by the very poor ability of Fuc-TV to fucosylate at the distal ends of neutral i-type polylactosamines, which is the preferred site of action of Fuc-TIX (49Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Kaneko M. Tawada A. Ito M. Narimatsu H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The different site specificities of Fuc-Ts V, IV, and IX are summarized in Fig. 2, which shows their preferred sites of action at the composite acceptor LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3′LN. The present data show that Fuc-TV reacts most rapidly at the reducing end LN unit of this acceptor, and the data suggest that the tetrasaccharide determinant LNβ1–3′LNat the reducing end of the acceptor may be involved in the accelerated reaction. For Fuc-TIV, in turn, the optimal acceptor site of the hexasaccharide appears to be the tetrasaccharide determinant GlcNAcβ1–3′LNβ1–3Gal in the middle of the acceptor. The enzyme is known to prefer the middle LN of the hexasaccharide acceptor, and the distal as well as the proximal LN units of the hexasaccharide are known to have rather similar acceptor activities (22Niemelä R. Natunen J. Majuri M.L., P, M. Lowe J. Renkonen O. Renkonen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Clearly, both Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TV appear to be particularly well fitted to work with i-type polylactosamines. By contrast, Fuc-TIX works best with the distal LN unit of i-chains; whether it, too, reacts preferentially with elongated elements of i-type polylactosamines remains to be elucidated.The Fuc-TV worked well with the β-methyl glycoside of LN and with the proximal LN unit of LNβ1–3LNβ1-OMe, showing that the high reactivity at proximal LN units in i-type polylactosamines is not due to mutarotational freedom. Fuc-TV worked well also with LNβ1–6Gal and LNβ1–6Man and their α3-sialylated derivatives, implying that methylene group-generated conformational freedom between the acceptor LN and its proximal substituents is important for a good reactivity. In line with these observations were the good reactivities of the O-glycans of core 2 type, LNβ1–6(Galβ1–3)GalNAc, and its α3′-sialylated form, as well as the poor reactivities of LNβ1–2Man and the biantennaryN-glycan (Glycan 37), where the axial linkage between LN and the proximal Man generates considerable steric hindrance. However, very poor reactivities were also observed at the 6-linked arms in LNβ1–3′(LNβ1–6′)LN and its α3′-sialylated form. Hence, it appears that in the I branched polylactosamines, the properties of linear acceptors may be dramatically changed. The very poor reactivity at the 6-linked arm in Neu5Acα2–3′LNβ1–3′(Neu5Acα2–3′LNβ1–6′)LN suggests that Fuc-TV is definitely not a tool of choice for in vitro synthesis of oligovalent sialyl Lewis x polylactosamines, representing branched structures that are potent antagonists of lymphocyte l-selectin (55Seppo A.

Maaheimo H. Costello C.E. Turunen J.P. Renkonen R. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).A characteristic feature of Fuc-TV is its ability to react at significant rates with two distinct, isomeric disaccharides,i.e. LN and LNB. Our present data show that Fuc-TV transfers to the LNB unit of the type 1 pentasaccharideLNBβ1–3′LNβ1–3Galβ1-OMe almost as well as it transfers to the free LNB-disaccharide (cf. Tables I andIII). By contrast, the enzyme fails to transfer to the distal LN of the type 2 pentasaccharide LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3Galβ1-OMe nearly as well as it transfers to unconjugated LN-disaccharide. This suggests that the GlcNAc units of LN and LNB interact with different amino acid residues on the Fuc-TV surface. This observation lends support to the conclusion drawn from a series of the mutagenesis and domain shuffling experiments, establishing amino acid differences in modified Fuc-TVs that are able to react only with free LNB, only with free LN, or with both unconjugated disaccharides (58Legault D.J.

Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Borges E. Lenter M. Kocher H. Kleuser B. Vestweber D. Nature. 1995; 373: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Tetra-antennaryN-glycans with a Neu5Acα2–3′Lexβ1–3′Lexβ1–4Man branch have been reported to bind E-selectin (62Patel T.P. Goelz S.E. Lobb R.R. Parekh R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14815-14824Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). One of the reported properties of Fuc-TV is its ability to convert nonfunctional ESL-1 of CHO cells into a functionally active form that is isolatable by affinity chromatography on a column of immobilized E-selectin (63Zollner O. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33002-33008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The present data on Fuc-TV reactivities of N-glycan acceptors suggest that the β1,4-linked, equatorial LN branch reacted much faster than the β1,2-linked, axial LN branches. Considered together, these sets of observations suggest that (i) Fuc-TV may participate in α3-fucosylation of the β1,4-linked (sialyl)LN and (sialyl)polylactosamine branches of tri- and tetra-antennaryN-glycans with some selectivity and that (ii) this may be important for generation of functional forms of ESL-1.

However, the present data reveal major differences between Fuc-TV and the other human Fuc-Ts working on polylactosamines. Whereas the Fuc-TV reactivities of LN units are strongly influenced by the presence or absence of neighboring GlcNAc, Gal, and LN units in i-type chains, this is not the case for the analogous Fuc-TIV reactivities (22Niemelä R.

Another striking difference is provided by the very poor ability of Fuc-TV to fucosylate at the distal ends of neutral i-type polylactosamines, which is the preferred site of action of Fuc-TIX (49Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Kaneko M. Tawada A. Ito M. Narimatsu H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The different site specificities of Fuc-Ts V, IV, and IX are summarized in Fig. 2, which shows their preferred sites of action at the composite acceptor LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3′LN. The present data show that Fuc-TV reacts most rapidly at the reducing end LN unit of this acceptor, and the data suggest that the tetrasaccharide determinant LNβ1–3′LNat the reducing end of the acceptor may be involved in the accelerated reaction. For Fuc-TIV, in turn, the optimal acceptor site of the hexasaccharide appears to be the tetrasaccharide determinant GlcNAcβ1–3′LNβ1–3Gal in the middle of the acceptor. The enzyme is known to prefer the middle LN of the hexasaccharide acceptor, and the distal as well as the proximal LN units of the hexasaccharide are known to have rather similar acceptor activities (22Niemelä R. Natunen J. Majuri M.L., P, M. Lowe J. Renkonen O. Renkonen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Clearly, both Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TV appear to be particularly well fitted to work with i-type polylactosamines. By contrast, Fuc-TIX works best with the distal LN unit of i-chains; whether it, too, reacts preferentially with elongated elements of i-type polylactosamines remains to be elucidated.The Fuc-TV worked well with the β-methyl glycoside of LN and with the proximal LN unit of LNβ1–3LNβ1-OMe, showing that the high reactivity at proximal LN units in i-type polylactosamines is not due to mutarotational freedom. Fuc-TV worked well also with LNβ1–6Gal and LNβ1–6Man and their α3-sialylated derivatives, implying that methylene group-generated conformational freedom between the acceptor LN and its proximal substituents is important for a good reactivity. In line with these observations were the good reactivities of the O-glycans of core 2 type, LNβ1–6(Galβ1–3)GalNAc, and its α3′-sialylated form, as well as the poor reactivities of LNβ1–2Man and the biantennaryN-glycan (Glycan 37), where the axial linkage between LN and the proximal Man generates considerable steric hindrance. However, very poor reactivities were also observed at the 6-linked arms in LNβ1–3′(LNβ1–6′)LN and its α3′-sialylated form. Hence, it appears that in the I branched polylactosamines, the properties of linear acceptors may be dramatically changed. The very poor reactivity at the 6-linked arm in Neu5Acα2–3′LNβ1–3′(Neu5Acα2–3′LNβ1–6′)LN suggests that Fuc-TV is definitely not a tool of choice for in vitro synthesis of oligovalent sialyl Lewis x polylactosamines, representing branched structures that are potent antagonists of lymphocyte l-selectin (55Seppo A.

Our present data show that Fuc-TV transfers to the LNB unit of the type 1 pentasaccharideLNBβ1–3′LNβ1–3Galβ1-OMe almost as well as it transfers to the free LNB-disaccharide (cf. Tables I andIII). By contrast, the enzyme fails to transfer to the distal LN of the type 2 pentasaccharide LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3Galβ1-OMe nearly as well as it transfers to unconjugated LN-disaccharide. This suggests that the GlcNAc units of LN and LNB interact with different amino acid residues on the Fuc-TV surface. This observation lends support to the conclusion drawn from a series of the mutagenesis and domain shuffling experiments, establishing amino acid differences in modified Fuc-TVs that are able to react only with free LNB, only with free LN, or with both unconjugated disaccharides (58Legault D.J.

Tetra-antennaryN-glycans with a Neu5Acα2–3′Lexβ1–3′Lexβ1–4Man branch have been reported to bind E-selectin (62Patel T.P. Goelz S.E. Lobb R.R. Parekh R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14815-14824Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). One of the reported properties of Fuc-TV is its ability to convert nonfunctional ESL-1 of CHO cells into a functionally active form that is isolatable by affinity chromatography on a column of immobilized E-selectin (63Zollner O. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33002-33008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The present data on Fuc-TV reactivities of N-glycan acceptors suggest that the β1,4-linked, equatorial LN branch reacted much faster than the β1,2-linked, axial LN branches. Considered together, these sets of observations suggest that (i) Fuc-TV may participate in α3-fucosylation of the β1,4-linked (sialyl)LN and (sialyl)polylactosamine branches of tri- and tetra-antennaryN-glycans with some selectivity and that (ii) this may be important for generation of functional forms of ESL-1. The present experiments extend the long list of small oligosaccharides that show acceptor activity for Fuc-TV. We show here that Fuc-TV transfers to LDN (GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc) as efficiently as to LN, leading to GalNAcβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc, which possesses a rigid conformation in solution similar to that of Lex (47Bergwerff A.A.

Both the full-length as well as the truncated recombinant Fuc-TV reacted slowly with N,N′-diacetyl-chitobiose,N,N′,N""-triacetyl-chitotriose andN,N′,N"",N′′′-tetra-acetylchitotetraose in the present experiments. Preparative scale experiments, to be reported elsewhere, have revealed that the fucosylated chitin glycans represent the trisaccharide GlcNAcβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc, the tetrasaccharide GlcNAcβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc, and the pentasaccharide GlcNAcβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc, respectively. 4J. Natunen, O. Aitio, J. Helin, H. Maaheimo, R. Niemelä, S. Heikkinen, and O. Renkonen, unpublished experiments. In addition, the present data show that some complete O- andN-glycans as well as polylactosamines are acceptors for Fuc-TV. The Fuc-TV reactivities of the reducing end LN units were high in all i-type polylactosamines. In striking contrast, the reactivities of the nonreducing end LN units were very low in all i-type polylactosamines. Our data are in agreement with the recent observation that Fuc-TV transfers more rapidly to the inner than the distal LN unit of LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3R (49Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Kaneko M. Tawada A. Ito M. Narimatsu H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Even in the terminally α3-sialylated polylactosamine Neu5Acα23′LNβ1–3′LN, the reducing end LN unit reacted quite rapidly in the present experiments, whereas the distal (sialyl)LN group reacted very slowly. Koeller and Wong (50Koeller K.M. Wong C.H. Chem.-Eur. J. 2000; 6: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported recently that recombinant soluble Fuc-TV transferred to Neu5Acα2–3′LNβ1–3′LNβ1–3′LNβ1-O-allyl only two fucosyl units at undetermined positions. In view of the slow reactivity of the distal sialylated LN unit in Glycans 26 and30 in the present experiments (cf. Table III), it is probable that the Fuc-TV-generated product of Koeller and Wong represented mainly Neu5Acα2–3′LNβ1–3′Lexβ1–3′Lexβ1-O-allyl. The present experiments were performed using 1–5 millimolar acceptor concentrations, about 1 order of magnitude smaller than theKm reported for LN by Murray et al. (51Murray B.W. Takayama S.

https://openalex.org/W2095432590,"The very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) binds and internalizes several ligands, including very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), urokinase-type plasminogen activator:plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 complexes, lipoprotein lipase, and the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein that copurifies with the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha(2)-macroglobulin receptor. Although several agonists regulate VLDL-R mRNA and/or protein expression, post-transcriptional regulation of receptor activity has not been described. Here, we report that the ligand binding activity of the VLDL-R in THP-1 monocytic cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and VLDL-R-transfected HEK 293 cells is diminished after treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This response was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PK-C), including a specific inhibitor of the PK-C beta II isoform, and was associated with phosphorylation of serine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. Culture of endothelial cells in the presence of high glucose concentrations, which stimulate diacylglycerol synthesis and PK-C beta II activation, also induced a PK-C-dependent loss of VLDL-R ligand binding activity. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the ligand binding activity of the VLDL-R is regulated by PK-C-dependent phosphorylation and that hyperglycemia may diminish VLDL-R activity."
