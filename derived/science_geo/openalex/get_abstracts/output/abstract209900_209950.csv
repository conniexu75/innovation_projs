https://openalex.org/W2022389731,"A method for readily demonstrating hemolysis of mammalian erythrocytes by Eaton's pleuropneumonia-like organism is described. This reaction may be useful in preliminary identification of this organism, since other strains from human sources are not known to have this property."

https://openalex.org/W2040024808,"Acquisition of a behavioral response motivated by shock was enhanced in rats chronically treated with yeast ribonucleic acid, and resistance to extinction was greater in rats so treated than in controls. This extends the role of ribonucleic acid to include a behavioral effect in laboratory mammals treated with a purified preparation from yeast."

https://openalex.org/W1965841444,Electron microscope and x-ray diffraction observations on highly ordered tactoids of fibrinogen show that these structures have the same axial period as fibrin. Implications of these results for the analysis of clot formation are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W2001073390,"Severe depletion of endogenous norepinephrine was observed in the brain, heart, liver, and spleen of albino rabbits in which hemorrhagic shock had been induced. On the other hand, the epinephrine content of these tissues was significantly elevated above the levels in tissues of control animals. The norepinephrine and epinephrine levels of skeletal muscle in shocked animals remained unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W1987058235,"THE mode of origin of blood in Teleosts is considered to represent an exception in the development of Vertebrates. Since the observations of Swaen and Brachet1 the intermediate cell mass of Oellacher is considered to be the earliest primordium of blood and blood-vessels. From its primitive situation between the somites and the lateral plate this mass will be pushed by the ventral mesoderm into the space which is limited on the dorsal side by the chorda and scleromyotomes, and by the entoderm on the ventral side."

https://openalex.org/W1995150393,"Examples of variability and apparent innovation presented in this paper are but a portion of the many examples in the literature. Thus, the notion of the ""unity of biochemistry"" has been advanced in an overly simplified form and reflects a primitive stage in the development of the discipline. Cells contain many more compounds and biosynthetic mechanisms than we had suspected or list in our texts. Accordingly, either early chemical evolution was far more extensive than we have postulated or an evolution of biochemical synthesis and function took place which was more extensive than has been postulated; perhaps both have occurred. The chemical choices available from the environment have been considerable rather than limited and the cells have chosen, adapted, improved upon a limited number of these, and in turn have themselves been selected. In the case of the naturally occurring antibiotic substances, biosynthetic mechanisms for compounds which do not fit within the cells' own nucleic acids and proteins to advantage have nevertheless been preserved since they contribute to survival. On the other hand, some of these compounds such as alpha-ribazole, are fitted to other metabolic uses. The existence of the large number of uncommon relatives of the common components of the nucleic acids and proteins in turn implies an enormous untapped area of potential knowledge concerning their paths of biosyntheses and the genetic and physiological controls for these same paths. That these compounds exist perhaps also indicates an expanded material basis for a continuing biochemical evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2024693732,"Azotobacter vinelandii has been characterized by its lack of acid production in culture1. In fact, most species of Azotobacter do not form acid, but appear to oxidize carbohydrates completely to carbon dioxide and water2. The notable exceptions to this are the acid-tolerant A. indicum (Beijerinckia indica)3 and A. macrocytogenes4 that are characterized by acid production. Other acid-tolerant species are not reported to be acid producers. There have been a few scattered reports of acid production by A. vinelandii, but these usually mention that it occurred during abnormal cultural conditions5, or with little or no growth6."

https://openalex.org/W2010831596,"THE system of nomenclature proposed for strains of trachoma/inclusion conjunctivitis (TRIC) agents1 provides the essential information with reasonable economy of symbols. Nevertheless, the fact that the full designations are rather cumbersome may militate against their general adoption. It should therefore be pointed out that when writing about a given strain the full designation need not be given after the first mention; thereafter it can be referred to by ‘element (d)’ only. Thus TRIC/2/SAU/HAR-2/OT becomes HAR-2."

Although a caffeine spot on a paper chromatogram exhibits a deep blue fluorescence under ultra-violet light, and may be eluted for subsequent identification by spectrophotometry1 or by crystal tests2, in common with most other xanthine derivatives caffeine does not react with the usual spray reagents, and there is need of a colour reaction which can be carried out directly on the paper."
