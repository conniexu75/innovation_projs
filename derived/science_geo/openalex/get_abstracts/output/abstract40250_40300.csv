https://openalex.org/W2050717506,"Two new methods were used to establish a rapid and highly sensitive prenatal diagnostic test for sickle cell anemia. The first involves the primer-mediated enzymatic amplification of specific beta-globin target sequences in genomic DNA, resulting in the exponential increase (220,000 times) of target DNA copies. In the second technique, the presence of the beta A and beta S alleles is determined by restriction endonuclease digestion of an end-labeled oligonucleotide probe hybridized in solution to the amplified beta-globin sequences. The beta-globin genotype can be determined in less than 1 day on samples containing significantly less than 1 microgram of genomic DNA."

Its primary sequence is very similar to that of the human epidermal growth factor receptor and the v-erbB oncogene product; the chromosomal location of the gene for this protein is coincident with the neu oncogene, which suggests that the two genes may be identical."
https://openalex.org/W2000247756,"This study provides evidence that the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine ameliorates the cognitive deficits exhibited by aged nonhuman primates through drug actions at alpha 2 receptors. Furthermore, pharmacological profiles in animals with lesions restricted to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex indicate that this area may be the site of action for some of clonidine's beneficial effects. These results demonstrate that alpha-adrenergic systems contribute to cognitive function and suggest a new strategy for treating memory disorders in aged humans."

https://openalex.org/W2048180296,"In several bursal lymphoma cell lines in which c-myc transcription is regulated by avian leukosis virus (ALV) long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences, protein synthesis inhibition decreases the transcriptional activity of c-myc as well as other LTR driven viral genes. This decrease in transcription is associated with a change in the chromatin structure of c-myc, as measured by deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) hypersensitivity, and a shift of transcription from the LTR to the normal c-myc promoter. In contrast, cycloheximide had little or no effect on the transcription of LTR driven genes in infected chicken embryo fibroblasts treated with the drug. These results suggest that a labile, cell type-specific protein may interact with the retroviral LTR and regulate transcription of genes under LTR control. Further, the results demonstrate that the increase in intracellular concentration of c-myc RNA induced by cycloheximide treatment of normal cells is the result of stabilization of this message."

https://openalex.org/W2052561020,"We show that dam- mutants are a major class of E. coli mutants with increased IS10 activity. IS10 has two dam methylation sites, one within the transposase promoter and one within the inner terminus where transposase presumably binds. Absence of methylation results in increased activity of both promoter and terminus, and completely accounts for increased transposition in dam- strains. Transposition of Tn903 and Tn5 are also increased in dam- strains, probably for analogous reasons. Transposition is also increased when IS10 is hemimethylated. One hemimethylated species is much more active than the other and is estimated to be at least 1000 times more active than a fully methylated element. Evidence is presented that the promoter and inner terminus of IS10 are coordinately activated in a dam-dependent fashion, presumably because they are hemimethylated at the same time. Thus, in dam+ strains, IS10 will transpose preferentially when DNA is hemimethylated. We suggest specifically that IS10 transposition may preferentially occur immediately after passage of a chromosomal replication fork."

https://openalex.org/W1513078811,"We have identified cDNAs clones for several cold-inducible mRNAs from the brown adipose tissue of mice. pCIN-1, a plasmid with a 900-base pair insert, encoded the mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) as determined by the ability of the cDNA insert to select, by hybridization, an mRNA that could be translated into a 32,000-Da protein immunoprecipitable with anti-UCP antibodies. Nine tissues were analyzed; however, UCP cDNA hybridized to an mRNA species of 1.6 and 2.0 kilobase pairs only in brown adipose tissue. A maximum induction of 10-fold occurred within 6 h of exposure to cold (5 degrees C). A BamHI restriction fragment polymorphism detected by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA in recombinant inbred mouse strains allowed us to map the UCP gene to Chromosome 8. The analysis of the UCP gene expression in diabetic (db) and obese (ob) mice maintained at 27 degrees C for 3 days followed by cold exposure for 4 h at 5 degrees C indicated that UCP mRNA levels in mutant mice were unaffected at 27 degrees C and only slightly reduced at 5 degrees C. Accordingly, the inability of diabetic and obese mice to thermoregulate is not associated with a lack of UCP mRNA induction."
https://openalex.org/W2168697593,"A retroviral expression vector (N2) containing the selectable gene, neoR, has been used to determine the optimal conditions for infecting murine hematopoietic progenitor cells at high efficiency. After infected bone marrow cells were introduced into lethally irradiated mice, the presence, stability, and expression of the vector DNA sequences were analyzed either in individual spleen foci 10 days later or in the blood, bone marrow, and spleens of mice 4 months later. When bone marrow cells were cultured in medium containing virus with titers of more than 10(6) colony-forming units per milliliter in the presence of purified murine interleukin-3, more than 85 percent of the resulting foci contained vector DNA. This proviral vector DNA was intact. Efficient expression of the neoR gene was demonstrated in most of the DNA-positive foci examined. The spleens of reconstituted animals (over a long term) contained intact ""vector DNA"" and the blood and bone marrow expressed the neoR gene in some animals. Thus, a retroviral vector can be used to introduce intact exogenous DNA sequences into hematopoietic stem cells with high efficiency and with substantial expression."
https://openalex.org/W1667874699,"Leader peptidase cleaves the amino-terminal leader sequences of many secreted and membrane proteins. We have examined the function of leader peptidase by constructing an Escherichia coli strain where its synthesis is controlled by the arabinose B promoter. This strain requires arabinose for growth. When the synthesis of leader peptidase is repressed, protein precursors accumulate, including the precursors of M13 coat protein (an inner membrane protein), maltose binding protein (a periplasmic protein), and OmpA protein (an outer membrane protein). These precursors are translocated across the plasma membrane, as judged by their sensitivity to added proteinase K. However, pro-OmpA and pre-maltose binding protein are retained at the outer surface of the inner membrane. Thus, leader peptides anchor translocated pre-proteins to the outer surface of the plasma membrane and must be removed to allow their subsequent release into the periplasm or transit to the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1533126363,"R 59 022 (6-[2-[4-[(4-fluorophenyl) phenylmethylene)-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-7-methyl-5H-thiazolo[3,2-alpha] pyrimidin-5-one) was found to inhibit diacylglycerol kinase in human red blood cell membranes at concentrations where polyphosphoinositide phosphodiesterase, phosphatidylinositol kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate kinase activity remained unaffected. The concentration needed for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) was 2.8 +/- 1.5 X 10(-6) M for the kinase acting on endogenous diacylglycerol and 3.3 +/- 0.4 X 10(-6) M when 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) was added exogenously as substrate. In intact platelets, R 59 022 inhibits the phosphorylation of OAG to 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglyceryl-3-phosphoric acid (OAPA) (IC50: 3.8 +/- 1.2 X 10(-6) M); concomitantly the stimulation of protein kinase C activity by OAG was amplified. When in platelets inositol lipid turnover is accelerated by thrombin, further addition of R 59 022 results in a marked elevation of diacylglycerol levels, a decreased formation of phosphatidic acid and an increased protein kinase C activity as compared with the controls. It is concluded that in studies on the signal-transducing system coupled to inositol lipid metabolism R 59 022 might occupy a role comparable to cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors, since it potentiates the effect of the putative second messenger diacylglycerol by preventing its rapid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2072973218,"Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a 22,000-dalton glycoprotein that stimulates the growth of myeloid progenitor cells and acts directly on mature neutrophils. A full-length complementary DNA clone encoding human GM-CSF was used as a probe to screen a human genomic library and isolate the gene encoding human GM-CSF. The human GM-CSF gene is approximately 2.5 kilobase pairs in length with at least three intervening sequences. The GM-CSF gene was localized by somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization to human chromosome region 5q21-5q32, which is involved in interstitial deletions in the 5q- syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia. An established, human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL60, contains a rearranged, partially deleted GM-CSF allele and a candidate 5q- marker chromosome, indicating that the truncated GM-CSF allele may reside at the rejoining point for the interstitial deletion on the HL60 marker chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1510671746,"Receptors for a chemotactic peptide (fMet-Leu-Phe) in guinea pig neutrophils were primarily coupled to phospholipase C catalyzing breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which was in turn responsible for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. These early responses of neutrophils to fMet-Leu-Phe, eventually leading to O2- generation, were abolished by prior exposure of cells to islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, which had been reported to bring about ADP-ribosylation of a membrane Mr = 41,000 protein (Okajima, F., and Ui, M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13863-13871). The IAP substrate, probably the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component of adenylate cyclase (Ni) or an analogous protein, is hence proposed to mediate fMet-Leu-Phe receptor-linked activation of the phospholipase C. In support of this proposal, A23187 and phorbol myristate acetate which stimulate arachidonate release or O2- generation by-passing these early processes of signaling were effective in IAP-treated cells as well. Release of arachidonic acid and accumulation of inositol 1-monophosphate in delayed response to fMet-Leu-Phe were also abolished by the IAP treatment of cells, despite the fact that slowly-onset inflow of Ca2+ which must be responsible for these delayed responses was observed in these IAP-treated cells. Thus, the IAP substrate may play an additional role in Ca2+-dependent activation of somehow compartmentalized phospholipases."
https://openalex.org/W2016167564,"Regulation of transcription of members of the ras gene family undoubtably plays an important role in controlling cellular growth. Examination of this level of regulation requires identification of the promoter regions of the ras proto-oncogenes. Four major transcriptional start sites were detected in the human Harvey ras 1 proto-oncogene. The promoter region contains neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box in their characteristic upstream positions, has an extremely high G+C content (80 percent), and contains multiple GC boxes including seven CCGCCC repeats and three repeats of the inverted complement, GGGCGG. This region has strong promoter activity when placed upstream from the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene and transfected into monkey CV1 cells. In these ways the Harvey ras 1 proto-oncogene promoter resembles the promoter of the gene encoding the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. The similarity between the two proto-oncogene promoters may be relevant to the mechanism by which the expression of such ""growth control"" genes is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2050795594,"The products of the adenovirus-2 (Ad2) immortalizing oncogene E1A repress the activity of the SV40, polyoma virus and E1A enhancers. Evidence is presented that Ad2 infection of MPC11 plasmocytoma cells results in an inhibition of transcription of both the γ2b heavy chain (IgH) and the kappa light chain immunoglobulin genes. This inhibition is caused by the Ad2 E1A products. Furthermore, the Ad2 E1A products repress transcription activated by the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer in chimeric recombinants, which are either stably integrated in the genome of lymphoid cells or are present as episomes. The implications of negative regulation of cellular enhancers are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2089796770,"Biochemical components (splicing factors) interact with specific intron regions during pre-mRNA splicing in vitro. The pre-mRNA specifically associates with factors at both the branch point and the 5' splice site and these RNA-factor interactions are maintained in the intron-containing RNA processing products. The first detectable event, the ATP-dependent association of a factor (or factors) with the branch point, is mediated by at least one factor containing an essential nucleic acid component. Mutant RNA substrates that lack either the 5' splice site or the vast majority of exon sequences can still associate with the branch point binding factor(s). However, this branch point-factor interaction does not occur with a mutant RNA substrate that contains the branch point but that lacks the 3' splice site consensus sequence. These results suggest that selection of the 3' splice site accompanied by the association of a factor with the branch point may be the initial step in mammalian pre-mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1578045006,"The expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors at the cell surface and the changes in IGF responsiveness during differentiation were studied in the L6 skeletal muscle cell line. Throughout the entire developmental sequence, distinct receptors for IGF I and IGF II that differed in structure and peptide specificity could be demonstrated. During differentiation, both 125I-IGF I and 125I-IGF II binding to the L6 cells decreased as a result of a 3-4-fold reduction in receptor number, whereas 125I-insulin binding increased. Under nonreducing conditions, disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linked 125I-IGF I and 125I-IGF II to two receptor complexes with apparent Mr greater than 300,000 (type I) and 220,000 (type II). Under reducing conditions, the apparent molecular weight of the type I receptor changed to Mr 130,000 (distinct from the 120,000 insulin receptor) and the type II receptor changed to 250,000. IGF I and IGF II both stimulated 2-deoxy-D-glucose and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake in the L6 cells with a potency close to that of insulin, apparently through interaction with their own receptors. The stimulatory effects of IGF II correlated with its affinity for the type II but not the type I IGF receptor, as measured by inhibition of affinity labeling, whereas the effects of IGF I correlated with its ability to inhibit labeling of the type I receptor. In spite of the decrease in type I and type II receptor number, stimulation of 2-deoxy-glucose and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake by the two IGFs increased during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2133293608,"beta-Adrenergic receptors, the GTP-binding regulatory protein that stimulates adenylate cyclase (Gs), and adenylate cyclase were each purified and reconstituted into unilamellar vesicles composed of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine (3:2, w/w). The molar ratio of receptor:Gs:adenylate cyclase was estimated to be about 1:10:1. Adenylate cyclase activity in the vesicles was stimulated up to 2.6-fold by beta-adrenergic agonists. Stimulation was dependent on the presence of guanine nucleotide, displayed appropriate beta-adrenergic selectivity and stereoselectivity for agonists, and was blocked appropriately by beta-adrenergic antagonists. Therefore, while additional proteins may modulate adenylate cyclase activity in native membranes, these results show that these three proteins are sufficient for the expression of hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W2166236008,"In order to circumvent problems associated with direct chemical analysis of the phase-1 flagellar filament protein (flagellin) of Salmonella typhimurium, the covalent structure was determined by recombinant DNA procedures. The corresponding structural gene (H-1i) was cloned into plasmid pBR322 in a 4.3-kilobase fragment produced by EcoRI digestion of chromosomal DNA, and the nucleotide sequence of the region specifying the flagellar protein was determined. Comparison of the data obtained with the limited information available for other salmonellar flagellins supported the concept that both ends of the molecule are conserved in this genus. Additionally, a conservation of base sequence in the region of H-1 genes coding for the N-terminal end of flagellins was apparent, suggesting that this area may have an additional regulatory role. The i flagellin was found to be unrelated to proteins in the NBRF data base with the exception of other flagellins. The three flagellins which have been sequenced to date (those produced by Bacillus subtilis, Caulobacter crescentis, and phase-1 S. typhimurium) show homologies in amino acid sequence at both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends despite large differences in their total molecular weight, and comparison suggests that B. subtilis and Salmonella are more closely related to each other than either is to Caulobacter."
https://openalex.org/W1919115463,"Angiotensin II can inhibit glucagon-stimulated cyclic AMP production in hepatocytes and adenylate cyclase activity in hepatic membranes. Pertussis toxin, an exotoxin produced by Bordetella pertussis, was used to investigate the role of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase (Ni) in coupling angiotensin receptors to the adenylate cyclase system. An assay was developed using [32P] NAD+ to quantitate the amount of Ni protein in the membrane and the extent of its ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by toxin. The ability of angiotensin to inhibit adenylate cyclase and interact with its receptor was compared with the degree of modification of Ni in membranes prepared from isolated hepatocytes. In control membranes angiotensin II inhibited basal adenylate cyclase by 35%. When all of the Ni molecules in the membrane were ADP-ribosylated, angiotensin did not inhibit adenylate cyclase. However, the attenuation of angiotensin's effect on cyclase was not linearly correlated with the degree of modification of Ni; ADP-ribosylation of greater than 80% of the Ni was required before a reduction of the angiotensin effect was observed. A possible explanation for this finding is an excess of Ni molecules in the membrane (approximately 3.4 pmol/mg of membrane protein) over angiotensin II receptors (approximately 1.2 pmol/mg of membrane protein). 125I-angiotensin bound to sites in the membrane with two affinities. Computer fitting of the binding isotherms yielded parameters of N1 = 279 fmol/mg protein, Kd1 = 0.2 nM; N2 = 904 fmol/mg protein, Kd2 = 1.4 nM. When all of the Ni molecules in the membrane were ADP-ribosylated, angiotensin bound to only one site with binding parameters of N = 349 fmol/mg protein, Kd = 0.4 nM. GTP-gamma-S caused a 7-fold increase in the Kd of this site to 2.7 nM. Overall, the data indicate that the Ni protein mediates the effect of angiotensin on adenylate cyclase. The observation that GTP-gamma-S can markedly decrease the affinity of angiotensin receptors when all Ni molecules are ADP-ribosylated suggests that angiotensin receptors may couple to other GTP-binding proteins which may mediate the effects of angiotensin in other signal transduction systems."
https://openalex.org/W1533101741,"Four members of a family of GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) which translate stimulation of extracellular receptors into regulation of intracellular enzymes were isolated from the bovine central nervous system. These proteins were examined for functional similarities and cross-reactivity with antibodies to the G-protein (transducin, Gt) from the photoreceptor system. Two proteins, Gs and Gi, can be distinguished by their respective abilities to stimulate or inhibit adenylate cyclase. The activated alpha subunits of Gt and a fourth member of the family, Go, did not affect this enzyme. Gt was shown to be unique in its ability to stimulate cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase. While functionally diverse, the G-proteins were shown to have some common antigenic properties. Antibodies directed against the beta subunit of Gt recognize the beta 36 subunits of all preparations but not a putative second beta 35 subunit. Antibodies specific for the alpha subunit of Gt did not recognize other alpha subunits when immune blots from sodium dodecyl sulfate gels were examined. However, Go alpha, but not Gs alpha or Gi alpha, reacted strongly with the antibodies when the native subunit was spotted directly. This suggests that Go alpha and Gt alpha have homologous structural determinants. An antiserum that recognized Gt gamma did not recognize gamma subunits from other sources. These data support the proposed diversity of function and similarity of structure among the four G-proteins. The alpha and potentially gamma subunits appear to be responsible for the specificity of function."

When exposed to the B subunit, the cells proliferated, as measured by 3H-labeled thymidine incorporation. Mitogenesis depended on the direct interaction of the B subunit with GM1 on the surface of the cells.

https://openalex.org/W1574301078,"Although insulin effectively blocked hormone-stimulated glycerol output in adipocytes or phosphorylase activation in hepatocytes, the inhibitory effect of insulin on cAMP analog-stimulated cells depended on the cAMP analog used. Of the 20 analogs tested in adipocytes and 13 tested in hepatocytes, the effects of about half of them were effectively blocked by insulin, whereas the effects of many of them were not inhibited at all. In order to approach the explanation for this discriminative insulin action, the inhibitory effects of insulin on the responses to the analogs in the intact cells were correlated with the in vitro cAMP analog specificity for the hepatocyte cAMP-dependent protein kinase isozymes and the low Km, hormone-sensitive phosphodiesterases from both cell types. No correlation was found between insulin resistance of analog-stimulated hepatocyte phosphorylase and the concentration of analog required in vitro for half-maximal activation of either type I or type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase from hepatocytes. However, a good correlation was found between insulin resistance of cAMP analog-stimulated responses and the analog I50 values for the phosphodiesterase from both cell types. Using a new method capable of measuring hydrolysis at low analog concentrations, several of those analogs which had relatively low, but not high, phosphodiesterase I50 values were shown to be directly hydrolyzed by the low Km adipocyte phosphodiesterase. The insulin inhibition of cell responses when stimulated by hydrolyzable analogs, but not by poorly hydrolyzable analogs, is best explained by insulin stimulation of the low Km phosphodiesterases from both cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1885787573,"A comparison of the DNA and protein sequences of a group of zein cDNA clones reveals that they share extensive sequence homology and probably originated from a common ancestral gene. A comparison of clones corresponding to Mr 22,000 polypeptides shows they are 92% homologous, while five clones corresponding to the Mr 19,000 zeins vary in homology from 75 to 95%. The clones corresponding to the Mr 22,000 proteins are 60-65% homologous to clones encoding the Mr 19,000 zein proteins. A clone corresponding to the Mr 15,000 zein has little homology to either the Mr 22,000 or 19,000 zeins. Clones corresponding to both the Mr 22,000 and 19,000 zeins have two putative polyadenylation signals. S1 nuclease mapping indicates that the first polyadenylation signal following the stop codon is utilized by the Mr 22,000 sequences, while primarily the second polyadenylation signal is utilized by the Mr 19,000 sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2095813743,"In order to characterize the heterogeneity and expression of maize zein genes, we constructed and characterized a cDNA library of endosperm mRNAs. Clones from the library that were of sufficient size to be full-length or near full-length copies of zein mRNA were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and cross-hybridization analysis. Based on these comparisons we found three classes of zein sequences corresponding to proteins of Mr 22,000, five corresponding to proteins of Mr 19,000, and a single one corresponding to a protein of Mr 15,000. Representative clones from these nine groups were used as probes to measure levels of the corresponding mRNAs in developing endosperms. It was found that these groups represent varying amounts of transcripts that range from 2 to 20% of the total endosperm mRNA population. For the Mr 19,000 and Mr 22,000 zein clones there is a correlation between the amount of mRNAs and the apparent number of genes in the genome. The relative level of mRNA for the Mr 15,000 zein was found to be 3 times that of the Mr 22,000 and Mr 19,000 zeins, suggesting that these genes are transcribed at a higher rate during endosperm development or that their mRNAs are more stable."
https://openalex.org/W1519916343,"5-Methyltryptamine, through a GTP-dependent mechanism, stimulated breakdown of endogenous [3H]inositol-labeled phosphoinositides in membranes prepared from blowfly salivary gland homogenates through a phospholipase C exhibiting a pH optimum of approximately 7.0. Unlabeled membranes, prepared from salivary gland homogenates, hydrolyzed exogenous [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate substrate with generation of labeled inositol phosphates. Inositol trisphosphate formation was increased approximately 200% by 10 microM guanosine 5'-(O-thio)-trisphosphate (GTP gamma S) within 30 s. 5-Methyltryptamine, in the presence of 10 microM GTP gamma S, increased the rate of inositol trisphosphate formation by approximately 500% within 30 s. Half-maximal activation of hormone-stimulated breakdown of exogenous substrate required approximately 0.05 microM GTP gamma S. [3H]Phosphatidylinositol was also hydrolyzed during incubation with membranes, resulting in the generation of inositol, glycerol phosphoinositol, and inositol monophosphate. Formation of inositol monophosphate was stimulated approximately 30% by 10 microM GTP gamma S and 10 microM 5-methyltryptamine. Neither inositol nor glycerol phosphoinositol formation was affected by hormone. These results indicate that in a cell-free system from blowfly salivary glands, 5-methyltryptamine, through a GTP-dependent mechanism, directly activates a phospholipase C which mediates phosphoinositide hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1566548239,"Poly(A)-RNAs were prepared from livers of rats treated with hydrocortisone and cycloheximide, then enriched for large mRNAs by successive sucrose gradients and gel electrophoresis. The size-selected RNAs were used as templates for synthesis of double-stranded cDNAs that were cloned in Escherichia coli using the pBR322 plasmid vector. Recombinant plasmids characterized as carrying inserts of potential interest were further analyzed by differential hybridization to mRNAs from untreated and hydrocortisone-treated rats. Seven of the cloned cDNAs were identified as complementary to mRNAs whose content in liver is sensitive to modulation by the steroid. Further screening for hormonal responsiveness revealed that two of the cloned cDNAs hybridize to a 3.4-kilobase mRNA that is rapidly induced in liver by treatment with insulin or cAMP as well as by hydrocortisone; restriction enzyme analysis demonstrated that the cDNAs from these two clones are derived from the same mRNA. In isolated nuclei, the rate of transcription of this mRNA is increased by each of the inducing hormones. This unusually regulated mRNA codes for a protein of 53 kDa on denaturing gels, undergoes rapid intracellular degradation that is prevented by cycloheximide, and appears to be the product of a single copy gene."
https://openalex.org/W1577707457,"The GlcNAc-1-P transferase was solubilized from pig aorta microsomal fractions using 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The activity of the solubilized enzyme was stimulated by exogeneously added phospholipids in the order phosphatidylglycerol greater than phosphatidylinositol greater than phosphatidylserine. When the enzyme was stored in 20% glycerol containing 20 micrograms of phosphatidylglycerol/mg of protein, more than 80% of the activity remained after storage for 6 days at 0-4 degrees C. On the other hand, in the absence of the stabilizers, the enzyme lost most of its activity within 24 h. The transferase was purified about 68-fold using ammonium sulfate and DEAE-cellulose fractionation. The DEAE-cellulose chromatography separated a heat-stable factor from the enzyme, which when added back to the partially purified enzyme stimulated about 5-fold. With this partially purified enzyme, the Km for UDP-GlcNAc was found to be 1 X 10(-7) M, and that for dolichyl-P about 1 X 10(-6) M. The stimulatory factor increased the Vmax for both UDP-GlcNAc and dolichyl-P 5-10-fold, but the Km values remained the same. The pH optimum for the enzyme was between 7.4 and 7.6, and either Mn2+ (1 mM) or Mg2+ (10 mM) was required for optimum activity. The GlcNAc-1-P transferase was also stimulated by the addition of GDP-mannose (or other purine sugar nucleotides) or dolichyl-phosphoryl-mannose to the incubation mixtures. These two compounds acted in different ways on the enzyme since their stimulatory effects were additive. The effect of GDP-mannose was found to be due to protection of the substrate, UDP-GlcNAc, from degradation, but the effect of dolichyl-P-mannose remains to be established. In addition, the stimulations shown by phosphatidylglycerol, GDP-mannose, and factor, or phosphatidylglycerol, dolichyl-P-mannose, and factor, were all additive, indicating that they were acting at different sites on the enzyme. The transferase was quite sensitive to the action of sulfhydryl reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide or p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, and was rapidly inactivated in their presence. The enzyme could be protected to the extent of about 50% when all of the substrates (UDP-GlcNAc, dolichyl-P, Mn2+) were added before the addition of the sulfhydryl reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1516056004,"It is generally thought that formation of inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate (IcP) on agonist-stimulated of endogenous phosphatidylinositol in intact cells would provide strong evidence for the direct phosphodiesteratic cleavage of phosphatidylinositol. We report here that on ionophoresis of extracts of pancreatic minilobules incubated with the cholecystokinin/pancreozymin congener, caerulein, the usual inositol phosphates, i.e. inositol 1-phosphate (IP), inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (IP2), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) were seen. In addition, an [3H]inositol-labeled unknown was present with the correct electrophoretic mobility of IcP. There was only a trace of in the unstimulated pancreatic minilobules. Several lines of evidence indicate that the unknown peak was IcP. 1) It ran on ionophoresis with standard [14C]IcP, and the ratio of 3H to 14C for each point on the peak was a constant within experimental error. 2) The putative IcP peak which had been eluted from the electropherogram also coincided with standard [14C]IcP on paper chromatography. 3) On mild acid hydrolysis in the presence of standard 14C-labeled IP, the putative [3H] IcP peak disappeared and appeared in the exact position of the standard [14C]IP peak, as to be predicted of IcP. The formation of IcP on agonist stimulation supports direct phosphodiesteratic cleavage of phosphatidylinositol on stimulation of phosphoinositide breakdown in pancreatic minilobules."
https://openalex.org/W1523502597,"Diethylstilbestrol is carcinogenic in rodents and in humans and its peroxidatic oxidation in utero has been associated with its carcinogenic activity. Horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of [14C]diethylstilbestrol and [14C]diethylstilbestrol analogs induced binding of radiolabel to DNA only when the compound contained a free hydroxy group (Metzler, M., and Epe, B. (1984) Chem. Biol. Interact. 50, 351-360). We have found that horseradish peroxidase or prostaglandin-H synthase-catalyzed oxidation of diethylstilbestrol in the presence of the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide caused the generation of an ESR signal indicative of a free radical intermediate (aN = 14.9 G, aH = 18.3 G). The identity of the trapped radical could not be identified on the basis of published hyperfine coupling constants, but the observation that horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of 1-naphthol produced an identical ESR signal suggests that the radical was either a phenoxy or phenoxy-derived radical. During horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of diethylstilbestrol in the presence of glutathione the thiol reduced the diethylstilbestrol radical to generate a thiyl radical. This was shown by a thiol-dependent oxygen uptake during horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of diethylstilbestrol and the observation of an ESR signal consistent with 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide-glutathionyl radical adduct formation. A diethylstilbestrol analog devoid of free hydroxy groups, namely diethylstilbestrol dipropionate, did not produce an ESR signal above control levels during horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed metabolism in the presence of 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide. Thus, free radicals are formed during peroxidatic oxidation of diethylstilbestrol and must be considered as possible determinants of the genotoxic activity of this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1501848752,"We have studied the effects of tunicamycin and inhibitors of the processing of N-linked glycans including N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin, castanospermine, mannodeoxynojirimycin, and swainsonine on the transport of glycoprotein E2 and the intracellular maturation of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59. Indirect immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibodies revealed that glycoprotein E2 exhibits different antigenic properties depending on the presence and on the structure of the N-linked oligosaccharides and that efficient transport of glycoprotein E2 to the plasma membrane requires the removal of glucose residues. In the presence of tunicamycin in the nonglycosylated E2 apoprotein was synthesized in normal amounts and readily acylated throughout the infectious cycle. This E2-species could not be detected on the surface of mouse hepatitis virus A59-infected cells with indirect immunofluorescence staining or lactoperoxidase labeling. N-Methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine, both of which selectively inhibited the processing glucosidases, caused a drop in virion formation by two log steps and a drastic delay in the surface expression of glycoprotein E2. The E2 species synthesized under such conditions was acylated but accumulated intracellularly in a compartment distinct from the Golgi. Concomitantly, synthesis of the matrix glycoprotein E1 of mouse hepatitis virus A59 was drastically impaired. Mannodeoxynojirimycin and swainsonine, which block later stages of the processing pathway, had less or no effect on the transport of glycoprotein E2 and the formation of virus particles."
https://openalex.org/W1524235451,"Abstract We report here the isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic sequences corresponding to a rat embryonic myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein. This gene, which is present as a single copy in the rat genome, comprises about 25 kilobase pairs of DNA and contains approximately 80% intronic sequences. The embryonic MHC gene belongs to a highly conserved multigene family, and exhibits a high degree of nucleotide and amino acid sequence conservation with other sarcomeric MHC genes from nematode to man. S1 nuclease mapping experiments using cDNA and genomic probes show that this MHC gene is transiently expressed during skeletal muscle development. Its mRNA is detected in fetal skeletal muscle during early development and persists up to 2 weeks after birth with the overlapping expression of neonatal and adult skeletal MHC mRNAs. However, this MHC is not expressed in the adult skeletal muscle with the exception of extraocular muscle fibers. The transient expression during muscle development of the isoform produced by this gene and its sequential replacement by other MHCs raises interesting questions about the mechanism controlling MHC isozyme transitions and the physiological significance of the individual MHCs in muscle fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1537679007,"The intermediate lobe of the pituitary contains the alpha-amidated peptide alpha-melanotropin and high levels of a copper and ascorbate-dependent peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) capable of converting peptides terminating in -X-Gly into amidated products (-X-NH2). As reported previously, the ability of cultured intermediate pituitary cells to produce alpha-amidated alpha-melanotropin declined rapidly. A decline in PAM activity assayed in vitro under optimized conditions failed to account quantitatively for the lack of production of alpha-amidated product, while a 100-fold decline in cellular levels of ascorbate could account for the lack of production of alpha-amidated product. Incubation of intermediate pituitary cultures with ascorbate partially restored the ability of the cells to produce alpha-amidated product without significantly increasing the level of PAM activity. In intermediate pituitary cultures made competent to produce alpha-melanotropin by addition of ascorbate, the actual extent of amidation occurring was modulated by the presence of specific secretagogues (bromocriptine or corticotropin-releasing factor). Cultured anterior pituitary cells showed a similar rapid 3-fold decline in PAM activity assayed in vitro under optimized conditions. Cellular levels of ascorbate also declined rapidly to levels 100-fold below those in the intact anterior pituitary. The addition of ascorbate to the anterior pituitary cultures rapidly restored the enzyme activity assayed in vitro to the levels in the initial cell suspension. Thus, production of amidated product peptide may be regulated by cellular levels of ascorbate, by cellular levels of PAM activity, and by the concentration of specific secretagogues to which the cells are exposed."
https://openalex.org/W1535427934,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of 6225 base pairs (bp) of Euglena gracilis chloroplast DNA including the complete DNA sequence of the chloroplast-encoded ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit gene along with the flanking DNA sequences is presented. The gene is greater than 5.5 kilobase pairs in length and is organized as 10 exons coding for 475 amino acids, separated by 9 introns. The exons range in size from 45 to 438 bp, while the introns range in size from 382 to 568 bp. The introns have highly conserved boundary sequences with the consensus, 5'-N GTGTGGATTT...(intron)...TTAATTTTAT N-3'. The introns are 82-85 mol% AT, with a pronounced T greater than A greater than G greater than C base bias in the RNA-like strand. They do not appear to encode any polypeptides. In addition, the introns have a conserved sequence 30-50 bp from their 3'-ends with the consensus, 5'-TACAGTTTGAAAATGA-3'. The 5'-TACA sequence bears some homology to the 5'-end of the TACTAACA sequence found in a similar location in yeast nuclear mRNA introns. The conserved sequences of the Euglena rbcL introns may be indicative of a splicing mechanism similar to that of eucaryotic nuclear mRNA introns and group II mitochondrial introns."
https://openalex.org/W1484047582,"Pantothenate kinase (ATP:D-pantothenate 4'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.33), the first enzyme in the pathway of CoA synthesis, was partially purified from rat heart. A study of the properties of the kinase showed that it possesses a broad pH optimum between 6 and 9, is activated or inhibited nonspecifically by various anions, and has MgATP as the nucleotide substrate. The Km for MgATP is 0.6 mM and that for pantothenate is 18 microM. CoA and acyl esters of CoA are inhibitors of the kinase with the inhibition by acetyl-CoA being only slightly greater than that by free CoA. The inhibition by free CoA is uncompetitive with respect to pantothenate concentration, with a Ki for inhibition of 0.2 microM. L-Carnitine was found to be a nonessential activator of the kinase. This compound had no effect by itself but specifically reversed the inhibition of the kinase by CoA. The Ka for deinhibition by L-carnitine is 0.27 mM. Free carnitine content was measured in perfused hearts and is found to vary in correlation with perfusion conditions that are known to alter rates of intracellular phosphorylation of pantothenate. These properties of pantothenate kinase provide a potential mechanism for the control of CoA synthesis. The enzyme is regulated by feedback inhibition by CoA and its acyl esters and this inhibition is modified by changes in the concentration of free carnitine."
https://openalex.org/W2431638578,"The enzymes responsible for the phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine and nucleoside analogs are important in the pathogenesis of adenosine deaminase deficiency and in the activation of specific anticancer and antiviral drugs. We examined the role of adenosine kinase in catalyzing these reactions using an enzyme purified 4000-fold (2.1 mumol/min/mg) from human placenta. The Km values of deoxyadenosine and ATP are 135 and 4 microM, respectively. Potassium and magnesium are absolute requirements for deoxyadenosine phosphorylation, and 150 mM potassium and 5 mM MgCl2 are critical for linear kinetics. With only 0.4 mM MgCl2 in excess of ATP levels, the Km for deoxyadenosine is increased 10-fold. ADP is a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 13 microM with variable MgATP2-, while it is a mixed inhibitor with a Ki and Ki' of 600 and 92 microM, respectively, when deoxyadenosine is variable. AMP is a mixed inhibitor with Ki and Ki' of 177 and 15 microM, respectively, with variable deoxyadenosine; it is a non-competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 17 microM and Ki' of 27 microM with variable ATP. Adenosine kinase phosphorylates adenine arabinoside with an apparent Km of 1 mM using deoxyadenosine kinase assay conditions. The Km values for 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside and 5-iodotubercidin, substrates for adenosine kinase, are estimated to be 4.5 microM and 2.6 nM, respectively. Other nucleoside analogs are potent inhibitors of deoxyadenosine phosphorylation, but their status as substrates remains unknown. These data indicate that deoxyadenosine phosphorylation by adenosine kinase is primarily regulated by its Km and the concentrations of Mg2+, ADP, and AMP. The high Km values for phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine and adenine arabinoside suggest that adenosine kinase may be less likely to phosphorylate these nucleosides in vivo than other enzymes with lower Km values. Adenosine kinase appears to be important for adenosine analog phosphorylation where the Michaelis constant is in the low micromolar range."
https://openalex.org/W1482416066,"A study has been made of the products of a reaction of oxidized ribonucleotides with a primary amine. As a model reaction, periodate-oxidized adenosine was combined with glycine in the presence of NaCNBH3. The purified major product of this reaction, adenine 9,2'-(4'-carboxymethyl-6'-hydroxymethylmorpholine), was characterized by 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and thin layer chromatography. When used to generate affinity columns, oxidized adenosine or oxidized ATP formed stable products with immobilized diaminohexane when treated with NaCNBH3. Failure to treat with NaCNBH3 yielded an unstable affinity matrix. These results are used in the interpretation of differing results when oxidized nucleotides have been used as affinity labels for different proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1494902244,"A monoclonal antibody capable of inhibiting opioid binding to rat neural membranes has been produced. Spleen cells from a BALB/c mouse, immunized with a partially purified opioid receptor complex, were fused with P3-X63.Ag8.653.3 myeloma cells. The cell line OR-689.2.4 secreted an IgM that was capable of partially inhibiting opioid binding to rat neural membranes under equilibrium binding conditions, while not affecting the binding of nonopioid ligands. Control mouse immunoglobulins and heat-denatured OR-689.2.4 did not inhibit opioid binding to membranes. The purified immunoglobulin inhibited the binding of [3H]dihydromorphine in a titrable, saturable, and reversible manner, as well as the binding of the delta-ligand [3H][D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin, the kappa-ligand [3H] ethylketocyclazocine, and 3H-labeled antagonists. In addition to blocking the binding of opioids to membranes, the immunoglobulin could also displace bound [3H]dihydromorphine from neural membranes. The 125I-labeled immunoglobulin specifically bound to neural membranes with a Kd of 1.3 nM and a maximal number of binding sites of 41.8 fmol/0.25 mg of membrane protein. In a titrable manner, the immunoglobulin precipitated opioid binding sites from a solubilized preparation of neural membranes. When OR-689.2.4 conjugated to Sepharose was incubated with the partially purified opioid receptor complex, labeled with 125I, a 35,000-dalton protein was specifically bound by the immunoglobulin. This antibody provides a tool for probing the multiple opioid binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1547248378,"The catecholamine derivatives aminomenthylnorepinephrine (compound 1) and bromoacetylaminomenthylnorepinephrine (compound 2) were synthesized and their interaction with the rat lung beta-adrenoreceptor was characterized. Compared to (-)-isoproterenol, compounds 1 and 2 were 10 and 280 times less potent, respectively, at inhibiting (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. At pH 7.4, all 3 compounds induced a loss of receptors (40-60%) which could be recovered by treatment with guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). However, at pH 8.1 Gpp(NH)p treatment did not recover those receptors lost by compound 2 only. The compound 2-induced receptor loss at pH 8.1 was time-dependent, prevented by propranolol but unaffected by Gpp(NH)p or after membrane heating at 50 degrees C which prevented the formation of the agonist high affinity binding state. Although, the maximal receptor loss as measured by [3H]dihydroalprenolol was 40-60%, more than 80% of the receptors were lost when measured by direct agonist binding, and the receptors left showed little agonist high affinity binding state formation. In rat reticulocyte membranes, compounds 1 and 2 stimulated adenylate cyclase activity with intrinsic activities of 0.55 and 0.31, respectively. However, at pH 8.1, compound 2 initially stimulated the enzyme followed by a blockade. These data indicated that both compounds 1 and 2 were partial beta-adrenoreceptor agonists and, at pH 8.1, compound 2 appeared to bind irreversibly only to those lung receptors able to form the agonist high affinity binding state. Furthermore, after irreversible binding, compound 2 appeared to act as an antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W1544222254,"Mouse 3T3 cells transformed by a conditional mutant of Rous sarcoma virus (LA90) can assume either a normal or a transformed phenotype, depending on the temperature of cultivation. These cells (LA90) were arrested at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle by starvation for serum growth factors at the nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C). Release from the G0/G1 phase by serum growth factors resulted in a rapid stimulation of Rb+ influx. To investigate whether the stimulation of Rb+ influx is obligatory for cell proliferation, the cultures were released from the G0/G1 phase by a temperature decrease in the absence of serum. A temperature decrease from 39 to 32 degrees C activated the viral pp60src gene mitogenic activity. Under these conditions, no rapid stimulation of Rb+ influx was observed. These results suggest that the rapid stimulation of Rb+ influx induced by serum growth factors is not an essential signal for cell release from the G0/G1 phase. However, a delayed increase in Rb+ influx concomitant with an increase in the cell content of K+ was observed in the cultures released from the G0/G1 phase by temperature decrease in the absence of serum growth factors. We found that the LA90 cells incubated at the permissive temperature (32 degrees C) secreted a mitogenic activity into the medium. Moreover, the conditioned medium from cultures incubated at 32 degrees C, but not at 39 degrees C, stimulate Rb+ influx in G0/G1 cells. These results indicate that Rous sarcoma virus pp60src induces a slow autocrine secretion of a mitogenic activity. This mitogenic activity slowly modulates the K+ content. Therefore, the slow elevation in cellular content of K+ is proposed to be an obligatory event for proliferation in normal and transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1986652598,There is clearly a long way to go before an effective therapy is developed for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However in the US federal efforts in this area have stepped up in recent months. The US Congress has approved a massive infusion of funds--a budget of US$240 million of which a substantial portion has been earmarked for testing drugs that show some promise against the AIDS virus. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is establishing a network of medical centers to carry out phase II trials of promising compounds that have undergone limited toxicity testing and 2000 patients are expected to be enrolled in these trials by late 1986. In addition to provide coordination and focus to the effort the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has established a drug evaluation committee. 3 major difficulties face AIDS researchers. First the AIDS virus becomes part of the cell it infects suggesting that it may never be removed entirely from the body. Second the virus is now known to infect the brain meaning that drugs must cross the blood-brain barrier. Third even if a drug can be found to interrupt the life cycle of the virus the patients immune system may already have been destroyed indicating a need for additional therapy to reconstitute the immune system. It appears likely that drugs will have to be administered on an intermittent basis throughout an AIDS patients life. Of the 4 compounds currently in limited clinical trials in the US (suramin azidothymidine ribavirin and HPA-23) none seems to offer much clinical improvement when given in the late stages of AIDS. In the future it may be possible to develop drugs that are targeted toward specific features of the life cycle of the AIDS virus. The hope is that if a safe and effective antiviral drug can be given to AIDS patients before their immune systems are destroyed their immune functions may regenerate spontaneously or be reconstituted through additional drug therapy.
https://openalex.org/W1585153936,"Protein phosphorylation was examined in cytosolic extracts of adult rat anterior pituitary. In the presence of both cyclic AMP and calmodulin, the phosphorylation of a Mr 22,000 protein was markedly stimulated. Cyclic AMP and calmodulin must both be present in order for this effect to be observed; cyclic GMP does not substitute for cyclic AMP, and the effect is abolished by either trifluoperazine or the heat-stable inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that there are three molecular species of the Mr 22,000 phosphoprotein, with pI values ranging from 6.8 to 8.1. Phosphorylation of this protein is maximally stimulated by 5 microM cyclic AMP and 5.7 microM calmodulin. The effect of cyclic AMP plus calmodulin is enhanced by preincubation and requires a divalent cation; maximal phosphorylation takes place at 100 microM Mn2+, although higher concentrations of Mg2+ and Co2+ support an equivalent degree of phosphorylation. Cyclic AMP plus calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation was not detected in other rat tissues surveyed, including brain, testes, adrenal, kidney, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, pineal, or posterior pituitary. These results help to explain the previous findings of Brattin and Portanova (Brattin, W.J., Jr., and Portanova, R. (1981) Mol. Cell. Endocr. 23, 77-90) of in vivo but not in vitro phosphorylation of three Mr 20,000 anterior pituitary proteins and indicate a possible point of convergence for calcium and cyclic AMP actions in the anterior pituitary."
