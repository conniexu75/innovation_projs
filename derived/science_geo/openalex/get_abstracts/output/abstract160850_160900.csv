https://openalex.org/W3037148409,"Crackling noise arises when a system responds to changing external conditions through discrete, impulsive events spanning a broad range of sizes. A wide variety of physical systems exhibiting crackling noise have been studied, from earthquakes on faults to paper crumpling. Because these systems exhibit regular behavior over many decades of sizes, their behavior is likely independent of microscopic and macroscopic details, and progress can be made by the use of very simple models. The fact that simple models and real systems can share the same behavior on a wide range of scales is called universality. We illustrate these ideas using results for our model of crackling noise in magnets, explaining the use of the renormalization group and scaling collapses. This field is still developing: we describe a number of continuing challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2031668046,"SUMO-1 is an ubiquitin-related protein that is covalently conjugated to a diverse assortment of proteins. The consequences of SUMO-1 modification include the regulation of protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, and protein subcellular localization. At present, very little is understood about the specific mechanisms that govern the recognition of proteins as substrates for SUMO-1 modification. However, many of the proteins that are modified by SUMO-1 interact directly with the SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme, Ubc9. These interactions suggest that Ubc9 binding may play an important role in substrate recognition as well as in substrate modification. The SUMO-1 consensus sequence (SUMO-1-CS) is a motif of conserved residues surrounding the modified lysine residue of most SUMO-1 substrates. This motif conforms to the sequence “ΨKXE,” where Ψ is a large hydrophobic residue, K is the lysine to which SUMO-1 is conjugated, X is any amino acid, and E is glutamic acid. In this study, we demonstrate that the SUMO-1-CS is a major determinant of Ubc9 binding and SUMO-1 modification. Mutating residues in the SUMO-1-CS abolishes both Ubc9 binding and substrate modification. These findings have important implications for how SUMO-1 substrates are recognized and for how SUMO-1 is ultimately transferred to specific lysine residues on these substrates.

SUMO-11 is a member of a family of ubiquitin-like proteins that are post-translationally conjugated to other proteins (1Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The specific effects of SUMO-1 modification appear to be substrate dependent, but they are clearly distinct from the effects of ubiquitination in mediating protein degradation. In a number of cases, SUMO-1 modification regulates the subcellular localization of specific substrates. For example, SUMO-1 modification targets RanGAP1 from the cytoplasm to the nuclear pore complex (2Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J.

IκBα and MDM2, for example, are both modified by SUMO-1 on lysine residues that also function as sites for ubiquitination (5Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol.

SUMO-1 modification of these lysines has been proposed to stabilize the substrates by blocking ubiquitin modification.

Immunofluorescence analysis and cell fractionation studies further indicate that the majority of proteins modified by SUMO-1 are nuclear and that they correspond to only a small subfraction of all cellular proteins (12Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The specific subfraction of proteins modified by SUMO-1 also varies throughout the cell cycle (13Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), and possibly in response to cellular growth conditions, indicating that SUMO-1 modification and de-modification are dynamic processes. However, the precise mechanisms involved in substrate selection and in regulating the timing of modification or demodification are poorly defined. Many steps involved in SUMO-1 modification parallel those involved in ubiquitination. Like ubiquitin, SUMO-1 is synthesized as a precursor that is proteolytically processed to generate the mature, active polypeptide (13Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 14Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Once processed, SUMO-1 is activated in an ATP-dependent reaction that creates a thioester intermediate between the active-site cysteine of the SUMO-1 activating enzyme (E1) and the carboxyl terminus of SUMO-1. The SUMO-1 E1 enzyme, a heterodimer consisting of Aos1 and Uba2, is structurally and functionally related to the ubiquitin E1 enzyme (14Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 15Gong L. Li B. Millas S. Yeh E.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Okuma T. Honda R. Ichikawa G. Tsumagari N. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Following activation, SUMO-1 is transferred from the E1 enzyme to Ubc9, a protein similar in structure and function to ubiquitin E2 enzymes (17Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). How SUMO-1 is subsequently transferred from Ubc9 to specific protein substrates is the most poorly defined step in the SUMO-1 conjugation pathway. Although SUMO-1 modification must be quite specific by virtue of the limited number of cellular proteins that are modified, there is very little, if any, homology among the currently known substrates. Probably all ubiquitination reactions involve E3 ligases, factors that mediate the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzymes to specific protein substrates (22Yamao F. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 125: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). In general, E3s function in substrate recognition and are responsible for the high degree of specificity that is characteristic of most ubiquitination reactions. Currently no E3-like factors have been identified for SUMO-1 conjugation, so how specific proteins are recognized as substrates for SUMO-1 conjugation remains unknown. Relative to ubiquitin-specific E2 enzymes, an unusual feature of Ubc9 is that it interacts directly with many SUMO-1 substrates (1Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). These interactions suggest that Ubc9 may play a direct role in recognizing SUMO-1 substrates, as well as in modifying them. In this study, we demonstrate that Ubc9 binds to the SUMO-1 consensus sequence (SUMO-1-CS), a motif of conserved residues surrounding the modified lysine of many SUMO-1 substrates. We further demonstrate that the binding of Ubc9 to the SUMO-1-CS is essential for SUMO-1 modification. Expression vectors coding for wild-type mouse RanGAP1, CΔ23, NΔ419/PK, and NΔ502/PK were constructed as previously described (3Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the GeneEditor Mutatgenesis System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. A cDNA coding for human Ubc9 was obtained from a fetal liver cDNA library using the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the GST expression vector, pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The carboxyl-terminal domain of mouse RanGAP1 (NΔ419: amino acids 420–589) was similarly amplified from a cDNA clone by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pGEX-5X-1. In vitro transcription and translation of RanGAP1 and RanGAP1-pyruvate kinase fusion proteins were performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine as described by the manufacturer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). GST-NΔ419 and GST-Ubc9 fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and cleaved from the beads by Factor Xa as outlined by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gel filtration analysis of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RanGAP1 and Ubc9 was performed on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 75 chromatography column. The column was equilibrated and proteins were fractionated with buffer containing 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. 20μ of each protein was loaded either individually or together following mixing and incubation for 30 min at room temperature. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, trichloroacetic acid precipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. GST-Ubc9, or GST alone, was bound to 20 μ l of glutathione-Sepharose beads (1 mg of protein/ml beads) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmdithiothreitol. Nonspecific protein-binding sites were blocked by incubation with 2% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at 4 °C. An equivalent amount (radioactive counts) of each in vitrotranslated protein was incubated with the beads in 100 μ l of binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature. Beads were washed three times with binding buffer followed by elution of the bound proteins with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Binding was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, or by quantifying counts in a liquid scintillation counter. The Ubc9 binding observed for each mutant protein relative to that of wild-type was determined from the ratio of GST-Ubc9 bound radioactive counts (following subtraction of counts bound to GST alone). Competition studies using SUMO-1 as a competitor were performed as described above except that translated proteins were incubated with immobilized Ubc9 in the presence of the indicated amounts of recombinant SUMO-1. Quantification of the relative amounts of modified and unmodified proteins bound to Ubc9 was determined by PhosphorImager analysis after separation of the proteins by SDS-PAGE. The carboxyl-terminal domain of RanGAP1 is modified by SUMO-1 at lysine residue 526 (3Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 24Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that modification at this site is dependent on a ∼120-amino acid domain of RanGAP1 extending from residue 470 to the carboxyl terminus (3Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) (summarized in Fig.1). The ability of this domain to specify SUMO-1 modification was demonstrated by in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, where SUMO-1 modification is mediated by endogenous Aos1/Uba2 and Ubc9 activities (3Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) (Fig.2, lanes 1 and7).Figure 2A 120-amino acid domain near the carboxyl terminus of RanGAP1 mediates Ubc9 binding. Wild-type RanGAP1 (lanes 1–3), the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant CΔ23 (lanes 4–6), and the pyruvate kinase fusion proteins NΔ419/PK (lanes 7–9), and ND502/PK (lanes 10–12) were transcribed and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with immobilized GST-Ubc9 or GST. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.

Molecular mass standards are indicated on the left and asterisksindicate SUMO-1-modified proteins. Unmodified RanGAP1 and pyruvate kinase fusion protein translation products all appear as triplets following separation by SDS-PAGE, possibly due to initiation of translation at internal start sites or to phosphorylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A significant fraction of the proteins modified by SUMO-1 are known to interact directly with the SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme, Ubc9 (1Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Although RanGAP1 is one of the best characterized SUMO-1 substrates, its interactions with Ubc9 have not been analyzed previously. To investigate the functional relevance of Ubc9-substrate interactions, we assayed for the ability of Ubc9 to bind to RanGAP1 and also to the various mutant and heterologous proteins summarized in Fig. 1. GST-Ubc9 (or GST alone as a control) was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 35S-labeled proteins produced by translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Full-length RanGAP1 interacted specifically with Ubc9 (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3), as did NΔ419/PK (Fig. 2, lanes 7–9). Significantly, both of these proteins are also modified by SUMO-1. Notably, both unmodified and SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 and NΔ419/PK interacted with Ubc9. In contrast, CΔ23 (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6) and NΔ502/PK (Fig.2, lanes 10–12) did not interact with Ubc9. As apparent inlanes 4 and 10, these same two proteins also failed to be modified by SUMO-1. These results indicate a correlation between the ability of these proteins to interact with Ubc9 and their ability to be modified by SUMO-1. The binding reactions described above were done in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, making it possible that the observed interaction between Ubc9 and RanGAP1 was indirect. To investigate whether Ubc9 and the carboxyl-terminal domain of RanGAP1 could form a complex in the absence of other factors, we analyzed the proteins by gel filtration chromatography either alone or together after mixing and incubating at room temperature. Bacterially expressed Ubc9 and NΔ419 were purified and individually fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Under these conditions, both proteins eluted as apparent monomers with calculated molecular masses of 20 kDa (Fig.3). When Ubc9 and NΔ419 were incubated together and subsequently fractionated on the same column they co-eluted as an apparent heterodimer with a calculated molecular mass of 40 kDa (Fig. 3). This result demonstrates that Ubc9 and the carboxyl-terminal domain of RanGAP1 interact directly to form a complex and that the complex is sufficiently stable to allow purification by gel filtration chromatography. This result also demonstrates that Ubc9 can bind to RanGAP1 prior to forming a thiol ester with SUMO-1. The precise lysine residues modified by SUMO-1 have been identified in approximately a dozen known substrates (1Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The majority of these modification sites conform to a consensus sequence that we refer to as the SUMO-1 consensus sequence, or SUMO-1-CS. The SUMO-1-CS is defined by four amino acids with the sequence “ΨKXE,” were Ψ is a large hydrophobic amino acid, K is the lysine residue modified by SUMO-1, X is any amino acid, and E is glutamic acid (Fig. 4). The conservation of residues surrounding the modified lysine suggests that they may be critical for substrate recognition and/or for the selection of the specific lysine residue for SUMO-1 modification. Nearly all of the substrates containing the SUMO-1-CS also interact with Ubc9, suggesting that the SUMO-1-CS may play a role in Ubc9 binding. To address this possibility, we mutated residues surrounding lysine 526 of RanGAP1, including the highly conserved residues conforming to the consensus sequence (Fig.5 A). Individual mutants were analyzed for their ability to be modified by SUMO-1 following translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and separation by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 B). Approximately one-third of the wild-type protein was converted to the SUMO-1-modified form when translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). As expected, mutating lysine 526 to arginine or alanine completely inhibited SUMO-1 modification (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5 and 6). Mutating histidine 521 to alanine had a noticeable, but less dramatic effect on SUMO-1 modification (Fig. 5 B, lane 2), whereas substituting alanine for lysine 530 had no effect on SUMO-1 modification (Fig.5 B, lane 8). Most notably, alanine substitutions of leucine residues 524 and 525 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and 4), and glutamic acid 528 (Fig. 5 B, lane 7) completely inhibited SUMO-1 modification. These results demonstrate that conserved residues surrounding the SUMO-1 modification site are critical for efficient SUMO-1 modification.Figure 5Conserved residues of the SUMO-1-CS are essential for SUMO-1 modification. Mutations in the SUMO-1-CS were introduced into the RanGAP1 pyruvate kinase fusion protein NΔ419/PK. Wild-type and mutant proteins were assayed for their ability to be modified by SUMO-1 by transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates.

We therefore assayed for whether mutations of the conserved residues surrounding the SUMO-1 modification site of RanGAP1 affected Ubc9 binding. GST-Ubc9 was immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with 35S-labeled proteins produced byin vitro translation. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, or by quantification using a scintillation counter. Four mutations were found to dramatically affect the interaction with Ubc9: leucine 524 to alanine (Fig.6, lanes 7–9), leucine 525 to alanine (Fig. 6, lanes 10–12), lysine 526 to alanine (Fig.6, lanes 13–15), and glutamic acid 528 to alanine (Fig. 6,lanes 19–21). Each of these mutations reduced the interaction with Ubc9 to less than 10% of that observed with the wild-type protein. Mutations of histidine 521 (Fig. 6, lanes 4–6) and lysine 530 (Fig. 6, lanes 22–24) to alanine had only modest affects on Ubc9 binding, reducing the interaction by ∼50 and 30%, respectively. Mutating the actual modification site, lysine 526, to arginine (Fig. 6, lanes 16–18) had no noticeable affect on Ubc9 binding, possibly due to the conservative nature of this amino acid substitution. These results again demonstrate a correlation between Ubc9 binding and SUMO-1 modification: proteins that retained their ability to interact with Ubc9 were modified by SUMO-1 (with the exception of K526R), whereas those that did not bind Ubc9 were not modified by SUMO-1. These results further demonstrate that conserved residues surrounding the SUMO-1 modification site are essential for Ubc9 binding. Despite the apparent role of the SUMO-1-CS (including the targeted lysine) in mediating Ubc9 binding, we observed that SUMO-1 modified RanGAP1 bound to Ubc9 as well as, and possibly better than, unmodified RanGAP1. To investigate whether SUMO-1 itself, after being conjugated to RanGAP1, could contribute to Ubc9 binding, we assayed for the binding of NΔ419/PK to Ubc9 in the presence of increasing concentrations of free SUMO-1. Surprisingly, we found that free SUMO-1 had a significant effect on the binding of SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 to Ubc9, but had only a modest effect on the binding of unmodified RanGAP1 (Fig. 7). We observed an ∼60% reduction in the binding of SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 when binding assays were performed in the presence of 3.25 mg/ml SUMO-1 (corresponding to an ∼15-fold excess over immobilized Ubc9) (Fig. 7,lanes 1 and 5). In the same assay, the binding of unmodified RanGAP1 was reduced by less than 20% (Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 5). These findings indicate that Ubc9 interacts with SUMO-1 modified RanGAP1 through SUMO-1, possibly independent of direct interactions with RanGAP1. SUMO-1 modification modulates protein functions by altering protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, protein subcellular localization, and possibly by directly altering protein activity. It is anticipated that SUMO-1 modification is highly regulated, with substrates being selectively recognized and modified in response to specific cellular signals. Several studies, for example, have demonstrated that SUMO-1-modified proteins vary with changes in the cell cycle (13Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) and in response to cellular growth conditions (10Mao Y. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26066-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,25Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which proteins are selectively recognized as substrates for SUMO-1 modification or de-modification and how such mechanisms might be regulated are not yet understood. We have begun to investigate how proteins are recognized as substrates for SUMO-1 modification and present evidence that direct interaction with the E2 enzyme, Ubc9, is an important part of this process. Using a domain derived from a well characterized SUMO-1 substrate, RanGAP1, we have demonstrated that SUMO-1 modification correlates with the ability to directly interact with Ubc9. This domain of RanGAP1 contains a consensus sequence, the SUMO-1-CS, which is found in nearly all known SUMO-1 substrates. The SUMO-1-CS contains the lysine residue to which SUMO-1 is covalently attached, and several highly conserved residues that flank this lysine. Although recognized by several other groups (26Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the functional significance of the SUMO-1-CS was not previously characterized. To investigate its role in SUMO-1 modification, we made alanine substitutions of the conserved residues in the SUMO-1-CS. These mutations were found to inhibit both Ubc9 binding and SUMO-1 modification. These findings indicate that the SUMO-1-CS plays a direct role in mediating the binding of Ubc9 to SUMO-1 substrates and that this binding is essential for substrate modification. The actual lysine acceptor in the SUMO-1-CS of RanGAP1 is important for the interaction with Ubc9, as an alanine substitution at this position inhibits Ubc9 binding. In apparent contradiction to this finding, it was also observed that SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 and free RanGAP1 interact equally well with Ubc9. Competition experiments using excess free SUMO-1, however, indicated that modified RanGAP1 likely interacts with Ubc9 through the SUMO-1 moiety. It remains to be determined whether the binding of modified RanGAP1 to Ubc9 is mediated solely through interactions with SUMO-1 or through a combination of interactions with RanGAP1 and SUMO-1. Previous studies have indicated that Ubc9 and free SUMO-1 can form direct, noncovalent interactions (29Liu Q. Jin C. Liao X. Shen Z. Chen D.J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16979-16987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether other SUMO-1-modified substrates interact similarly with Ubc9, or whether this interaction is specific for modified RanGAP1. In vivo, Ubc9 is concentrated at the nuclear envelope at sites that overlap with the localization of SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 (19Lee G.W. Melchior F. Matunis M.J. Mahajan R. Tian Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6503-6507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although Ubc9 has been shown to interact with the nucleoporin Nup358 (18Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined whether this interaction is direct or mediated by SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1. In addition to demonstrating a role for the SUMO-1-CS in Ubc9 binding, we also found that ∼50 amino acids on either side of the consensus sequence were required for Ubc9 binding and SUMO-1 modification. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of this larger domain with other SUMO-1 substrates reveals no obvious homologies outside of the SUMO-1-CS. It therefore remains to be determined whether additional residues outside of the SUMO-1-CS are directly involved in Ubc9 binding, or whether they indirectly affect binding by influencing the proper folding and exposure of a smaller domain containing the SUMO-1-CS. Evidence that the precise position of the SUMO-1 CS within a protein can be an important determinant of its ability to function in SUMO-1 modification is provided by analysis of the heat shock transcription factor, HSF2. HSF2 contains three putative SUMO-1-CS motifs, but is modified at a lysine residue in only one of these motifs (45Goodson, M. L., Hong, Y., Rogers, R., Matunis, M. J., Park-Sarge, O.-K., and Sarge, K. D. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, in press.Google Scholar). The precise position of the SUMO-1-CS within a protein is likely to determine its accessibility and, therefore, its potential to interact with Ubc9. The presence of a SUMO-1-CS in a protein is therefore not an absolute indicator of whether that protein will be a substrate for SUMO-1 modification. Further analysis of the amino acid residues surrounding the SUMO-1-CS and their contributions to Ubc9 binding will be needed to refine the definition of a SUMO-1 substrate. In this particular study, we examined the SUMO-1-CS of RanGAP1, but we propose that the SUMO-1-CS of other SUMO-1 substrates will function similarly to mediate Ubc9 binding and facilitate SUMO-1 modification. Ubc9-binding domains have been partially mapped in a large number of known and putative SUMO-1 substrates. Many of these domains contain SUMO-1-CS motifs, including the Ubc9-binding domains found in WT1 (30Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Seufert W. Taguchi T. Testa J.R. Whitmore S.A. Callen D.F. Welsh D. Shenk T.

Gene ( Amst .). 1997; 190: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Other motifs in addition to the SUMO-1-CS may also mediate Ubc9 binding, however. Most notably, Ubc9 also interacts with the RING domain of PML (26Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of this interaction remains unclear as mutations that disrupt interactions between Ubc9 and the PML RING domain have very little effect on the SUMO-1 modification of PML (26Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37Kamitani T. Kito K.

It has also recently been proposed that PEST sequences may play a role in regulating the interaction of Ubc9 with at least some SUMO-1 substrates (1Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 38Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although PEST sequences are best known for their involvement in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (39Rechsteiner M. Revis Biol. Celular. 1989; 20: 235-253PubMed Google Scholar), they are found in more than half of the known SUMO-1 substrates. The binding of Ubc9 to the SUMO-1-CS argues against a direct requirement for E3 ligases in SUMO-1 modification. However, it is possible that the modification of substrates with a SUMO-1-CS may be regulated or facilitated by the action of E3-like factors in vivo. Regardless of this consideration, a more detailed analysis of the direct interactions between Ubc9 and the SUMO-1-CS will provide important insights into the mechanisms involved in the ultimate transfer of SUMO-1 to specific substrates. Despite crystallographic studies of ubiquitin E2-E3 complexes (40Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 41Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), the exact mechanism that underlies the transfer of ubiquitin from upstream factors to protein substrates remains poorly defined. Given the high degree of homology between Ubc9 and ubiquitin E2 enzymes, it is likely that the transfer of SUMO-1 to protein substrates will be very similar to the process of ubiquitination. Detailed characterization of the interactions between Ubc9 and the SUMO-1-CS should, therefore, provide important insights into the mechanisms of both ubiquitination and SUMO-1 modification. It will also be important to further characterize the role of amino acids surrounding the SUMO-1-CS, to determine whether they function indirectly to present an exposed consensus sequence, or whether they are also involved in significant interactions with Ubc9.

https://openalex.org/W2049714772,"Treatment of fetal rat hepatocytes with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is followed by apoptotic cell death. Analysis of radical oxygen species (ROS) content and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsim), using specific fluorescent probes in FACScan and confocal microscopy, showed that TGF-beta mediates ROS production that precedes the loss of Deltapsim, the release of cytochrome c, and the activation of caspase 3. TGF-beta induces a decrease in the protein and mRNA levels of bcl-xL, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. In contrast, there is no change in the expression and/or translocation of Bax, a proapoptotic member of the same family. EGF maintains Bcl-xL, preventing Deltapsim collapse and release of cytochrome c. The presence of radical scavengers blocks the decrease in bcl-xL levels, Deltapsim collapse, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspase 3; in contrast, the presence of glutathione synthesis inhibitors such as BSO accentuated the effect. The incubation of fetal hepatocytes in the presence of ter-butyl-hydroperoxide alone produces a decrease in bcl-xL. These results indicate that during the apoptosis mediated by TGF-beta in fetal hepatocytes, ROS may be responsible for the decrease in bcl-xL mRNA levels that precedes the loss of Deltapsim, the release of cytochrome c, and the activation of caspase 3, culminating in cell death."

This glycosylation event confers cancer cell resistance to cytotoxic anticancer agents [Liu, Y. Y., Han, T. Y., Giuliano, A. E., and M. C. Cabot. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 1140-1146]. We previously found that glucosylceramide, the glycosylated form of ceramide, accumulates in adriamycin-resistant breast carcinoma cells, in vinblastine-resistant epithelioid carcinoma cells, and in tumor specimens from patients showing poor response to chemotherapy. Here we show that multidrug resistance can be increased over baseline and then totally reversed in human breast cancer cells by GCS gene targeting. In adriamycin-resistant MCF-7-AdrR cells, transfection of GCS upgraded multidrug resistance, whereas transfection of GCS antisense markedly restored cellular sensitivity to anthracyclines, Vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and other anticancer drugs. Sensitivity to the various drugs by GCS antisense transfection increased 7- to 240-fold and was consistent with the resumption of ceramide-caspase-apoptotic signaling. GCS targeting had little influence on cellular sensitivity to either 5-FU or cisplatin, nor did it modify P-glycoprotein expression or rhodamine-123 efflux. GCS antisense transfection did enhance rhodamine-123 uptake compared with parent MCF-7-AdrR cells. This study reveals that GCS is a novel mechanism of multidrug resistance and positions GCS antisense as an innovative force to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1997052628,"In the nematode CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS, dauer formation, stress resistance, and longevity are determined in part by DAF-2 (insulin receptor-like protein), AGE-1 (phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase cat¬alytic subunit), and DAF-16 (forkhead transcription factor). Mutations in DAF-2 and AGE-1 result in increased resistance to heat, oxidants, and UV. We have discov¬ered that DAF-2 and AGE-1 mutations result in increased Cd and Cu ion resistance in a 24 h toxicity assay. Lethal concentration (LC50) values for Cd and Cu ions in DAF-2 and AGE-1 mutants were significantly (P<0.001) higher than in wild-type nematodes. However, LC50 values in DAF-16;AGE-1 mutants were not significantly different, implying that metal resistance is influenced by a DAF-16-related function. As metallothionein (MT) proteins play a major role in metal detoxification, we examined the expression of MT genes both under noninducing conditions and after exposure to sublethal and acute heavy metal stress. MT1 mRNA levels were significantly (P<0.05) higher in DAF-2 mutants compared to AGE-1 mutants and wild-type C. ELEGANS under basal conditions. After 10 mM Cd treatment, induction of MT1 and MT2 mRNA was three- and twofold higher, respectively, in DAF-2 mutant worms than in wild-type. However, a sublethal concentration of Cd (0.1 mM) resulted in even higher (three- to sevenfold) levels of both MT mRNAs in all strains. Cu did not induce MT1 or MT2 mRNAs. These results are consistent with a model in which the insulin-signaling pathway determines life span through regulation of stress protein genes.— Barsyte, D., Lovejoy, D. A., Lithgow, G. J.

https://openalex.org/W2068890239,"The complete AIF cDNA comprising the amino-terminal mitochondrial localization sequence (MLS) and the oxidoreductase domain has been fused in its carboxyl terminus to enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), thereby engineering an AIF-GFP fusion protein that is selectively targeted to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Upon induction of apoptosis, the AIF-GFP protein translocates together with cytochrome c (Cyt-c) to the extramitochondrial compartment. Microinjection of recombinant AIF leads to the release of AIF-GFP and Cyt-c-GFP, indicating that ectopic AIF can favor permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane. These mitochondrial effects of AIF are caspase independent, whereas the Cyt-c-microinjection induced translocation of AIF-GFP and Cyt-c-GFP is suppressed by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk. Upon prolonged culture, transfection-enforced overexpression of AIF results in spontaneous translocation of AIF-GFP from mitochondria, nuclear chromatin condensation, and cell death. These effects are caspase independent and do not rely on the oxidoreductase function of AIF. Spontaneous AIF-GFP translocation and subsequent nuclear apoptosis can be retarded by overexpression of a Bcl-2 protein selectively targeted to mitochondria, but not by a Bcl-2 protein targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression of a mutant AIF protein in which the MLS has been deleted (AIF Delta 1-100) results in the primary cytosolic accumulation of AIF. AIF Delta 1-100-induced cell death is suppressed by neither Z-VAD.fmk or by Bcl-2. Thus, extramitochondrially targeted AIF is a dominant cell death inducer."
https://openalex.org/W2153355914,"Many natural processes consist of networks of interacting elements that, over time, affect each other's state. Their dynamics depend on the pattern of connections and the updating rules for each element. Genomic regulatory networks are networks of this sort. In this paper we use artificial neural networks as a model of the dynamics of gene expression. The significance of the regulatory effect of one gene product on the expression of other genes of the system is defined by a weight matrix. The model considers multigenic regulation including positive and/or negative feedback. The process of gene expression is described by a single network and by two linked networks where transcription and translation are modeled independently. Each of these processes is described by different network controlled by different weight matrices. Methods for computing the parameters of the model from experimental data are discussed. Results computed by means of the model are compared with experimental observations. Generalization to a 'black box' concept, where the molecular processes occurring in the cell are considered as signal processing units forming a global regulatory network, is discussed.-Vohradský, J.

https://openalex.org/W1999391010,"Relatively little is known concerning the regulation of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in the heart. We investigated in the adult rodent heart 1) whether changes in workload, substrate supply, or cytokine (TNF-alpha) administration affect UCP-2 and UCP-3 expression, and 2) whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) regulates the expression of either UCP-2 or UCP-3. Direct comparisons were made between cardiac and skeletal muscle. UCP-2, UCP-3, and PPARalpha expression were reduced when cardiac workload was either increased (pressure overload by aortic constriction) or decreased (mechanical unloading by heterotopic transplantation). Similar results were observed during cytokine administration. Reduced dietary fatty acid availability resulted in decreased expression of both cardiac UCP-2 and UCP-3. However, when fatty acid (the natural ligand for PPARalpha) supply was increased (high-fat feeding, fasting, and STZ-induced diabetes), cardiac UCP-3 but not UCP-2 expression increased. Comparable results were observed in rats treated with the specific PPARalpha agonist WY-14,643. The level of cardiac UCP-3 but not UCP-2 expression was severely reduced (20-fold) in PPARalpha-/- mice compared to wild-type mice. These results suggest that in the adult rodent heart, UCP-3 expression is regulated by PPARalpha. In contrast, cardiac UCP-2 expression is regulated in part by a fatty acid-dependent, PPARalpha-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1996545028,"Hair graying, an age-associated process of unknown etiology, is characterized by a reduced number and activity of hair follicle (HF) melanocytes. Stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor c-kit are important for melanocyte survival during development, and mutations in these genes result in unpigmented hairs. Here we show that during cyclic HF regeneration in C57BL/6 mice, proliferating, differentiating, and melanin-producing melanocytes express c-kit, whereas presumptive melanocyte precursors do not. SCF overexpression in HF epithelium significantly increases the number and proliferative activity of melanocytes. During the induced hair cycle in C57BL/6 mice, administration of anti-c-kit antibody dose-dependently decreases hair pigmentation and leads to partially depigmented (gray) or fully depigmented (white) hairs, associated with significant decreases in melanocyte proliferation and differentiation, as determined by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. However, in the next hair cycle, the previously treated animals grow fully pigmented hairs with the normal number and distribution of melanocytes. This suggests that melanocyte stem cells are not dependent on SCF/c-kit and when appropriately stimulated can generate melanogenically active melanocytes. Therefore, the blockade of c-kit signaling offers a fully reversible model for hair depigmentation, which might be used for the studies of hair pigmentation disorders."

Here we provide a mechanism through which Smad-dependent TGF-b signaling is modulated by protein kinase C (PKC). PKC, for example, is activated downstream of tyrosine kinase receptors. We show that PKC directly phosphorylates receptor-regulated Smad proteins. This phosphorylation abrogates the ability of Smad3 to bind directly to DNA, which leads to subsequent inability to mediate transcriptional responses dependent on the direct binding of Smad3 to DNA. Interference with PKC regulation of Smad functions increased cell sensitivity to transformation by the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Smad3 was found also to be a key event in the PMA-dependent inactivation of TGF-b-stimulated cell death. Thus, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Smad3 leads to down-regulation of the growth inhibitory and apoptotic action of TGF-b."

For a family of genes that are ubiquitously expressed in more than 10 isoforms, the number of substrates identified to date is surprisingly limited. Attempts to identify JNK substrates by the two-hybrid screen in most cases failed, probably because of the nature of JNK-targeted ubiquitination of its bound substrates. To identify new putative substrates for this kinase, we adopted the approach developed by Shokat and colleagues (46Liu Y. Shah K. Yang F. Witucki L. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 91-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 47Gillespie P.G. Gillespie S.K. Mercer J.A. Shah K. Shokat K.M. J. Biol.

This approach enables performing kinase reactions in the presence of whole cellular proteins and yet selectively identifying specific substrates, thus providing a “semi” in vivo setting for identifying putative substrates. Here we describe the use of this approach to modify JNK, identify the highest affinity ATP analogue, and subsequently identify putative new substrates. We demonstrate the ability of this technique to identify heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K, or K protein) as a new MAPK/JNK substrate. hnRNP-K (K protein) belongs to a large family of nuclear RNA-binding proteins that form complexes with RNA polymerase II transcripts (50Krecic A. Swanson M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar,51Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The hnRNP-K protein has been implicated in diverse molecular and cellular functions, including nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling and RNA transcription and translation (52Bomsztyk K. Seuningen I. Suzuki H. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The K homology motifs, originally found in hnRNP-K, are implicated in RNA binding (53Lee M.-H. Mori S. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3420-3427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Import and export of K protein is mediated via the KNS domain (aa 323–390), which confers bidirectional transport across the nuclear envelope and represents a novel shuttling pathway (54Michael W. Eder P. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The K protein has also been shown to regulate translation in the cytoplasm. Together with another K homology domain protein, hnRNP-E1, it binds to a CU-rich “differentiation control element” in the 3′-untranslated region of15-lipoxygenase mRNA and silences the translation of this message in immature erythroid precursor cells (55Ostareck D.

Transactivation by the K protein involves an increase in RNA synthesis of various reporter genes (56Tomonaga T. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4875-4881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The K protein has also been found to bind to a single-stranded DNA sequence of the human c-mycpromoter and to affect transcription of c-myc as well as ofSp1 and Sp3 (58Du Q. Melnikova I. Gardner P.

The mechanistic basis of regulation of K protein activities is not well understood. The carboxyl terminus of the K protein consists of the SH3-binding cluster, which is required for binding of K protein with Vav, an association implicated in the cytoplasmic localization of K protein (61Hobert O.

Src as well as protein kinase Cδ and an interleukin 1-responsive K protein kinase have been shown to phosphorylate hnRNP K, although the significance of this phosphorylation is not known (65Seuningen I.

Here we characterize the phosphorylation of K protein by JNK and demonstrate that K protein phosphorylation is required for its contribution to AP1-dependent transcriptional activities. Human embryo kidney cells (293T) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with calf serum (10%) and antibiotics. HnRNP K cDNA was polymerase chain reaction amplified using an HA-tagged primer and cloned into pCDNA3 or pGEX-4T-2. Mutations on serine phosphorylation sites (S116A, S216A, S284A, and S353A) of hnRNP K and in the ATP pocket of JNK2 (M108G and L168A) were performed using the Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutated hnRNP K cDNA was also subcloned into the pGEX-4T-2 plasmid. GST-Jun was expressed and purified as described previously (28Davis R.-J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). pGEX-4T-2-hnRNP K fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified using immobilized glutathione beads (Pierce) by standard methods. E. coli nucleoside diphosphate kinase (0.1 mg) was mixed with 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in HBS (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and equilibrated at room temperature for 5 min followed by separation on a Bio-spin column (p-6). Phenythyl-ADP (5 μl of 0.1 mm) was added to the phosphorylated nucleoside diphosphate kinase for 10 min at room temperature before the reaction mixture was heated (80 °C for 2 min) and subsequently spun down to pellet the denatured nucleoside diphosphate kinase (24Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Protein kinase assays were carried out using a fusion protein (GST-Jun) or whole cell extract that was dialyzed against kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mmNaF, 0.1 mm NaVO3, 5 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, and 75 mm NaCl) as described previously (33Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of GST-Jun or 100 μg of lysate were incubated with immunopurified HA-JNK or HA-JNK-as3 in the presence of kinase buffer containing 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP or32P-labeled N 6-(2-phenythyl)-ATP and 25 μm cold ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated GST-Jun was separated on SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated lysate was separated by two-dimensional PAGE followed by staining and autoradiography. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) gels (consist of 8 m urea, 4% acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1.6% Pharmalyte pH 5–8, and 0.4% Pharmalyte pH3–10) were prepared in gel tube (inner diameter: 2 mm × 18 cm; BioRad). Following polymerization (3 h), IEF gels were pre-run for 1 h at 200 V with 10 mmH3P04 as anode butter and 20 mmNaOH as cathode buffer. Samples were loaded (40 μl) and run at 400 V for 14–16 h followed by 800 V for 1 h. IEF gels were removed from tube and equilibrated in SDS sample buffer for 15 min at room temperature before they were placed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and run at 40 mA until the dye front reached to the bottom of the gel. Tandem nanoflow electrospray mass spectrometry employing a PE Sciex QSTAR instrument was used to determine the sequence of peptides obtained by tryptic digestion of 3 silver-stained spots. The peptide sequences obtained for the corresponding spots were: GGRGGSRAR, NTDEMVELR, and NLPPPPPPR, each of which exhibited 100% identity with the hnRNP-K protein. 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3, wt-HA-JNK2, or HA-JNK2-as3 by standard calcium phosphate precipitation methods. Thirty hours later, cells were exposed to UV-C (60 J/m2) and harvested after 45 min. Protein samples were prepared from cells as previously described (31Adler V. Polotskaya A. Wagner F. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17001-17005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in phosphate-free medium for 1 h before addition of [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/plate) for 1 h. HA antibody immunoprecipitated HA-K was separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane following autoradiography and Western blot. To enable selective screening for putative JNK substrates, we modified the ATP-binding site on JNK (JNK analogue specific 3; JNK-as3) so that it utilizes an ATP analogue. Based on the success of engineering both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases from a wide variety of protein kinase families including, Src, Fyn, CDK2, Cla4 (yeast Pak kinase), CaMKII, and fus3 (yeast MAPK), we have identified two key residues that must be modified in wild-type kinase to allow recognition of ATP analogues modified at the N (6Widmann C.

Chem. 1998; 6: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These two residues in JNK are M108G and L168A, respectively, and are analogous to the mutations required to create Cla4-as3 (Fig. 1; Ref. 68Weiss E.L. Bishop A.C. Shokat K.M. Drubin D.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 677-685Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The mutations M108G and L168A maintained JNK inducibility by UV as well as its substrate recognition (Fig.2 a). To identify the modified form of ATP that exhibits the highest affinity to JNK-as3 we compared four forms of ATP, of which N 6-(2-phenythyl)-ATP exhibited the strongest ability to inhibit phosphorylation of c-Jun by modified but not wt forms of JNK when added in excess as the cold form of ATP (Fig. 2 b). 32P-LabeledN 6-(2-phenythyl)-ATP also exhibited the highest affinity for the mutant but not for the wt form of JNK in its ability to phosphorylate c-Jun (Fig. 2 c). Given the low cross-reactivity with the wt form of JNK and the high affinity for the modified JNK, these observations suggest thatN 6-(2-phenythyl)-ATP could be used to enable detection of specific JNK substrates in the presence of endogenous form of JNK.Figure 2Generation of ATP pocket mutant JNK and identification of ATP analogue. a, in vitrokinase assay using GST-Jun as substrate and wt- or JNK-as3 (analog specific 3, mutated on aa M108G,L168A) immunopurified from UV-treated (60 J/m2) 293T cells was carried out as previously described (33Adler V.

Phosphorylated proteins were separated on two-dimensional gels followed by silver staining (Fig. 3 b) and subsequent autoradiography (Fig. 3 a). Following alignment of the phosphorylated proteins to those seen in the silver-stained gels, we isolated the corresponding spots. Tandem nanoflow electrospray mass spectrometry of silver-stained spots, which corresponded to the phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 3, a andb), identified 3 peptide sequences, each of which exhibited 100% homology with hnRNP-K protein (Fig. 3 c). The full-length cDNA of the K protein was cloned into bacterial and mammalian expression vectors. Bacterially expressed and purified GST-tagged K protein was efficiently phosphorylated in vitroby the immunopurified active form of JNK but not by immunopurified p38 (Fig. 4 a). Further analysis carried out using proteins prepared from cells before and after UV treatment revealed efficient phosphorylation of the K protein as early as 30 min after UV treatment and to lesser degrees by proteins prepared 2 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 4 b). Forced expression of the constitutively active form of ERK and to a lesser degree of JNK was also efficient in leading to the phosphorylation of K protein (Fig.4 b). These observations confirm that the K protein can serve as a substrate for JNK and ERK phosphorylation. To identify the JNK/ERK phosphoacceptor sites on the K protein, we mutated the proline-driven serines at aa 116, 216, 284, and 353. Of the four mutants, S216A and S353A exhibited the lowest degree of JNK phosphorylation when compared with the wt protein (Fig.5 a). When subjected to phosphorylation by ERK, the most efficient decrease in ERK phosphorylation was observed with the S353A mutant. A noticeable decrease was also seen in phosphorylation of the S284A mutant, whereas the S216A mutant revealed a marginal decrease in phosphorylation when compared with the wt form of the K protein (Fig. 5 b). Of interest is the slight shift in the Mr of the S116A mutant, although the mutation did not affect the degree of phosphorylation by either ERK or JNK (Fig. 5, a andb). These findings demonstrate that different residues on the K protein may serve as the primary phosphoacceptor sites for JNKversus ERK. Since no single mutant revealed complete loss of phosphorylation of K protein by ERK, we mutated the K protein on multiple phosphoacceptor sites. Among the K proteins that contain different combinations of mutations on different phosphoacceptor sites, a double mutant (S216 and S353) exhibited the most efficient decrease in JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 5 c), whereas a double mutant (S284A,S353A) exhibited the most efficient decrease in ERK phosphorylation (Fig.5 d). A triple mutant (S216A,S284A,S353A) exhibited the same degree of phosphorylation as that shown by the double mutant, suggesting that the primary site for JNK phosphorylation consists of serines 216 and 353 on the K protein. Analysis of secondary structure prediction of wt versus phosphomutant forms of the K protein via the predict-protein software did not reveal change in the conformation/structure of the K protein due to these mutations (data not shown). To confirm phosphorylation of the K protein by JNK or ERK in vivo, we performed orthophosphate labeling of cells that had been transfected with the K protein and the respective upstream kinases for ERK, p38, or JNK. Immunoprecipitation of the K protein followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography revealed efficient phosphorylation upon expression of MEK-EL, a constitutively active form of MEK that drives ERK phosphorylation. UV treatment and JNKK2(CAA) were also capable of mediating phosphorylation of the K protein (Fig.6). The cellular functions attributed to the K protein include inhibition of RNA translation (55Ostareck D. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B. Mann M. Hentze M. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and transcriptional activation (53Lee M.-H. Mori S. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10784-10791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since phosphorylation of the K protein by JNK did not affect its ability to elicit inhibition of RNA translation (49Habelhah H. Shah K. Huang L. Ostareck-Lederer A. Burlingame A.L. Shokat K.M. Hentze M.W. Ronai Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), we have further elucidated the role of JNK in K protein ability to contribute to transcriptional activities. Among promoters that were affected by K protein are those that consist of the AP1 site (53Lee M.-H. Mori S. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3420-3427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Given the role of JNK in the activation of c-Jun and ATF2, primary factors that mediate transcription from AP1 sites, we have elucidated the possible contribution of JNK to K protein effect on transcription from AP1 sites. To this end we have co-transfected Jun-LUC construct with either wt or phosphomutant (216/353) forms of the K protein into 293T cells. To modulate the degree of JNK, activity cells were also transfected with either the constitutive active JNK upstream, kinase (JNKK2(CAA)), or with a dominant negative JNK construct (JNK(APF)) in conjunction with UV treatment as indicated. Whereas forced expression of JNKK2(CAA) alone is sufficient to increase Jun-LUC activity (67%), co-transfection of K and JNKK2(CAA) further induce (>3-fold) Jun-LUC activity (Fig. 7 a). The latter increase is dependent on K protein phosphorylation by JNK since co-expression of the phosphomutant K protein (K216/353) with JNKK2(CAA) did not increase Jun-LUC activities. The effect of JNK on K proteins ability to facilitate transcription from AP1 site is specific for JNK since the mutant form of JNK (on its phosphoacceptor sites, which render it as a dead kinase and as a dominant negative for endogenous JNK) failed to mediate increase in AP1 activities. Further support for the role of JNK in K protein contribution to AP1-mediated transcription comes from the analysis of Jun-LUC activities in UV-treated cells. Whereas UV irradiation led to a noticeable increase (>3-fold which was comparable to the effect of JNKK2CAA) this increase was completely attenuated upon JNK(APF) expression. This observation suggests that the ability to increase AP1-dependent transcriptional activities via K protein is dependent on JNK activities. A smaller (60%) increase in AP1-mediated transcription was also seen in UV-treated cells that were co-transfected with the phosphomutant form of K, probably due to the effect of UV on the endogenously expressed K protein, which could not be out-competed by exogenous expression of the phosphomutant K form (49Habelhah H. Shah K. Huang L. Ostareck-Lederer A. Burlingame A.L. Shokat K.M. Hentze M.W. Ronai Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Indeed, co-expression of phosphomutant K and JNK(APF) attenuated the UV-mediated increase in Jun-LUC activities. Further studies on K protein contribution to transcription from promoters bearing the AP1 site was carried out using the upstream kinase MEKK1 in its constitutively active form (ΔMEKK1). This powerful construct efficiently activates most stress kinase cascades, including JNK, p38, MAPK, and IKK. Forced expression of ΔMEKK1 efficiently activated transcription of Jun-LUC (8-fold), which was further increased (up to 11-fold) upon K protein expression (Fig.7 b). Increase observed upon K protein expression was attenuated by JNK-APF. Along these lines, phosphomutant K was not able to augment the transcriptional activities that were mediated by ΔMEKK1. Expression of JNK(APF) in combination with the phosphomutant form of the K protein reduced some of the increase (25%) mediated by ΔMEKK1, probably due to the limited effects of these constructs on the endogenous form of K protein. Together, these findings point to the role of JNK in acquiring K protein ability to contribute to transcriptional activation, as shown here for Jun-LUC bearing promoter sequences. Among the stress-activated protein kinases, JNK has been well characterized as central to the cells decision for life or death in response to most cellular stress-inducing agents. JNK elicits its potent regulatory function through tight regulation of its substrates, which in most cases are bound to JNK and concomitantly targeted by JNK for ubiquitination and degradation under non-stressed conditions. After exposure to any of the diverse stimuli that can activate it, the kinase efficiently phosphorylates the substrate, gaining in stability and activity. Despite the large amount of data accumulated so far with regard to JNKs ability to regulate transcription factors and other stress-related proteins, the number of stress kinases remains small, considering that JNK comprises a family of 3 genes that appear in over 10 different isoforms. It is imperative to identify new JNK substrates that may form part of the stress response and therefore dictate the fate of the stressed cell. Here we demonstrate a new approach to the identification of potential new JNK substrates. Using the technique originally developed by Kevan and colleagues (45Shah K. Liu Y. Deirmengian C. Shokat K.M.

This new match enables selective phosphorylation of JNK substrates when the modified kinase and ATP are supplied. Importantly, the modification does not hamper JNK activation by stress, nor does it affect the recognition of JNK substrates, as shown here for c-Jun. Using this approach, the current studies demonstrate the identification of hnRNP-K as a JNK and ERK substrate. The phosphoacceptor sites for JNK and ERK on the K protein are different, and indeed, ERK phosphorylation results in biological consequences different from those of phosphorylation by JNK (49Habelhah H. Shah K. Huang L. Ostareck-Lederer A. Burlingame A.L. Shokat K.M. Hentze M.W. Ronai Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Whereas ERK phosphorylation on aa 284 and 353 contributes to K protein nuclear export and concomitant inhibition of RNA translation (49Habelhah H. Shah K. Huang L. Ostareck-Lederer A. Burlingame A.L. Shokat K.M. Hentze M.W. Ronai Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), phosphorylation by K protein on aa 216 and 353 increases the transcriptional effects of the K protein. This finding illustrates the diverse forms of regulation of K protein by varying protein kinases, each of which contributes to different K protein functions. The method developed and employed here for the identification of novel JNK substrates could be employed for identification of JNK substrates in various tissues, in response to different stimuli, at various stages of development, and in promotion and progression of human tumors. Each of the scenarios requires that the set of proteins be used against the corresponding controls to assure that novel JNK substrates are selected. Overall, the altered JNK and its corresponding ATP as described in the current study open new horizons for elucidating novel JNK substrates. Implications of K protein phosphorylation by JNK are illustrated for K proteins contribution to transcriptional activities, in this case via AP1 sequences. Among the mechanisms underlying K protein ability to confer increased transcriptional output are interconversion of duplex and single-stranded DNA (59Tomonaga T. Levens D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and association with the C/EBPβ (60Miau L.-H. Chang C.-J. Shen B.-J. Tsai W.-H. Lee S.-C. J. Biol.

The increased effect of the K protein on transcription is expected to have a wide effect on transcriptional output due to the general nature of K protein effect on transcriptional regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2150556036,"Lung fibrosis is a fatal condition of excess extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition associated with increased transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) activity. Although much is known about its pathological features, our understanding of the signal transduction pathways resulting in increased ECM and collagen deposition in response to TGF-beta is still incompletely defined. We have previously reported that a JunD homodimer of the transcription factor AP-1 is specifically activated by TGF-beta in lung fibroblasts. Here we demonstrate that JunD is also specifically required for TGF-beta-induced effects. Antisense against JunD, but not c-fos or c-jun, significantly inhibited collagen deposition in response to TGF-beta in primary human lung fibroblasts. We then investigated the ability of pharmacological agents to inhibit TGF-beta-induced signaling and collagen deposition. Cs-A and IFN-gamma, but not glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, or azathioprine, inhibited TGF-beta-induced signaling, as assessed by luciferase reporter gene assays, and collagen deposition. TGF-beta antagonism by Cs-A was associated with direct inhibition of JunD activation, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift analyses. In contrast, the effects of IFN-gamma required signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1. We thus identify the JunD isoform of AP-1 as an essential mediator of TGF-beta-induced effects in lung fibroblasts. TGF-beta-induced signaling and collagen deposition are efficiently antagonized by Cs-A and IFN-gamma treatment, both of which exhibit distinct molecular mechanisms of action. These observations therefore offer novel targets for future therapy of fibrotic lung disease."

To determine the extent of age-related myocardial oxidative stress, oxidant production, antioxidant status, and oxidative DNA damage were measured in hearts of young (2 months) and old (28 months) male Fischer 344 rats. Cardiac myocytes isolated from old rats showed a nearly threefold increase in the rate of oxidant production compared to young rats, as measured by the rates of 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate oxidation. Determination of myocardial antioxidant status revealed a significant twofold decline in the levels of ascorbic acid (P = 0.03), but not alpha-tocopherol. A significant age-related increase (P = 0.05) in steady-state levels of oxidative DNA damage was observed, as monitored by 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine levels. To investigate whether dietary supplementation with (R)-alpha-lipoic acid (LA) was effective at reducing oxidative stress, young and old rats were fed an AIN-93M diet with or without 0.2% (w/w) LA for 2 wk before death. Cardiac myocytes from old, LA-supplemented rats exhibited a markedly lower rate of oxidant production that was no longer significantly different from that in cells from unsupplemented, young rats. Lipoic acid supplementation also restored myocardial ascorbic acid levels and reduced oxidative DNA damage. Our data indicate that the aging rat heart is under increased mitochondrial-induced oxidative stress, which is significantly attenuated by lipoic acid supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W2117326627,"Small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs), for example, decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, and lumican, are extracellular matrix organizers and binding partners of TGF-b. Decorin is also involved in growth control and angiogenesis. Hence, these proteoglycans are likely of importance in the pathogenesis of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. In normal kidney, SLRPs were preferentially expressed in the tubulointerstitium. Weak expression occurred in the mesangial matrix. Biglycan was expressed by glomerular endothelial cells and, together with fibromodulin, by distal tubular cells and in collecting ducts. In all stages of diabetic nephropathy, there was a marked up-regulation of the proteoglycans in tubulointerstitium and glomeruli. Decorin and lumican became expressed in tubuli. However, in glomeruli, overexpression was not mirrored by local proteoglycan accumulation except in advanced nephropathy. In severe glomerulosclerosis, increased decorin concentrations were found in plasma and urine, and urinary TGF-b/decorin complexes could be demonstrated indirectly. The failure to detect an increased glomerular proteoglycan quantity during the development of nephropathy could be explained by assuming that they are secreted into the mesangial matrix, but cleared via the vasculature or the urinary tract, in part as complexes with TGF-b. They could thereby counteract the vicious circle being characterized by increased TGF-b production and increased matrix deposition in diabetic nephropathy."

Members of the NXF family of proteins have a conserved modular domain organization consisting of a non-canonical RNP-type RNA-binding domain (RBD), a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a middle region showing significant sequence similarity to nuclear transport factor 2 (the NTF2-like domain) and a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA)-like domain (Fig. 1 and Refs. 1Herold A.

The LRR and the NTF2-like domains are the most conserved features of NXF proteins, whereas the RBD and the C-terminal UBA-like domain are not always present in NXF proteins (1Herold A. Suyama M.

Furthermore, the RBD of TAP is required in cis to the LRR domain for specific binding to the CTE RNA (7Liker E. Fernadez E. Izaurralde E. Conti E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Hence, the RBD and the LRR domain are essential for TAP-mediated export of CTE-containing cargoes (1Herold A. Suyama M.

The NTF2-like domain of metazoan NXFs mediates binding to a protein known as p15 or NXT. p15 is also related to NTF2 (8Suyama M. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Sattler M. Izaurralde I. Bork P.

The NTF2-like domain also occurs in Schizosaccharomyces pombeand S. cerevisiae Mex67p, although there is no obvious p15 homologue encoded by the yeast genome (8Suyama M. Doerks T. Braun I.C.

Prediction of Mtr2p secondary structure and the observation that co-expression of human TAP and p15 in S. cerevisiae partially restores growth of a strain carrying the otherwise lethal mex67/mtr2 double knockout, suggest that Mtr2p may be a p15 functional analogue (8Suyama M.

The UBA-like domain on its own (fragment 567–619) is not sufficient to localize TAP at the nuclear rim in vivo, but single amino acid changes in a conserved loop of this domain (NWD at positions 593–595 in human TAP) severely impair binding of TAP, Hs NXF2, and Ce NXF1 to nucleoporins in vitro and in vivo (1Herold A.

This suggests that high affinity binding to nucleoporins requires both the UBA-like domain and at least part of the NTF2-like domain. The UBA-like domain is conserved in yeast Mex67p, but only the S. cerevisiae protein has been shown to interact directly with nucleoporins (20Strawn, L. A., Shen, T., and Wente, S. R. (2000)J. Biol.

To this end, we developed assays to test mRNA export stimulation by TAP/p15 heterodimers in cultured cells and inXenopus oocytes. These assays are based on the observation that overexpression of TAP with p15 bypasses nuclear retention and stimulates export of mRNAs that are normally not exported efficiently. Using these assays, we show that in the presence of p15, only full-length TAP efficiently stimulates export of a variety of mRNA export cargoes. The RBD is dispensable for the stimulation of mRNA export by TAP whereas the LRR and the NTF2-like domains are essential for this function. The first 60 amino acids of TAP and the UBA-like domain contribute substantially, but are not strictly required for TAP-mediated export of cellular mRNA. These results were confirmed by directly tethering TAP/p15 heterodimers to the RNA export cargo. Most plasmids used in this study have been described before (1Herold A. Suyama M. Rodrigues J.P.

TAP ΔRBD corresponds to a deletion of residues 119–198 in the TAP protein sequence (7Liker E. Fernadez E. Izaurralde E. Conti E.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), TAP ΔNTF2 and TAP ΔUBA correspond to the deletions TAP Δ437–507 and TAP Δ567–613 described before (9Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Panté N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Görlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA. 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). TAP point mutants were generated using an oligonucleotide-directedin vitro mutagenesis system from Stratagene (Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis). For expression of TAP and TAP mutants as glutathione S-transferase fusions inEscherichia coli, the corresponding cDNAs were cloned between the NcoI and BamHI sites of vector pGEXCS (21Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A. Dougherty W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). TAP and TAP mutants were expressed in mammalian cells as fusions with green fluorescent protein (GFP). To this end, cDNA fragments encoding TAP or TAP mutants were excised from the corresponding pGEXCS constructs as NarI-BamHI fragments and cloned into the vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) between theAccI and BamHI restriction sites. p15-1 was expressed with an N-terminal tag consisting of two immunoglobulin-binding domains from protein A of Staphylococcus aureus (zz tag). For expression in E. coli, p15-1 cDNA was cloned into pQE70zz vector (1Herold A. Suyama M. Rodrigues J.P. Braun I.C. Kutay U. Carmo-Fonseca M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8996-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cDNA fragment encoding zzp15-1 was excised from pQE60zzp15-1 plasmid using the restriction sites HindIII-NotI and inserted into pEGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH) cut with the same enzymes. This deletes the GFP coding sequence. For expression of TAP/p15 heterodimers in E. coli, a bicistronic plasmid was constructed by inserting a ribosome-binding site followed by the p15-2a cDNA downstream of the TAP coding sequence in plasmid pGEXCS-TAP. Plasmid pCMV128 has been described (22Huang X. Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Grahl K. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2131-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23McDonald D. Hope T.J. Parslow T.G.

Virol. 1992; 66: 7232-7236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); plasmid pCH110 encoding β-galactosidase (β-gal) is from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. cDNAs encoding HIV-I Rev protein and the export-deficient mutant RevM10 were kindly provided by Françoise Stutz (University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland). These cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned between the AgeI andBsrGI sites of plasmid pEGFP-C1, thereby deleting the GFP coding sequence. The 5′ polymerase chain reaction oligo introduced a HA-tag N-terminal so that Rev and RevM10 fusions can be detected by Western blot using anti-HA antibodies. The resulting plasmids, pCMV-Rev and pCMV-RevM10, were sequenced and used in subsequent cloning steps. Plasmids expressing RevM10 fusions of TAP mutants and p15-1 were generated by replacing the GFP coding sequence from the corresponding pEGFP-C1 plasmids by the HA-RevM10 coding sequence using theAgeI and EcoRI restriction sites. TAP full-length and TAP Δ567–613 were excised from the corresponding pGEXCS plasmids as NarI-BamHI fragments. The BamHI site was blunted by T4 DNA polymerase. These cDNAs were cloned into the AccI-SmaI sites of vector pCMV-RevM10. GlutathioneS-transferase protein fusions were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strains. E. coli M15[pREP4] strain was used for expressing proteins cloned into the pQE60zz vector. Recombinant proteins were purified as previously described (4Grüter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C.

For oocyte injections recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 1.5 × phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 10% glycerol. DNA transfections and CAT assays were performed essentially as described before (1Herold A. Suyama M. Rodrigues J.P. Braun I.C. Kutay U. Carmo-Fonseca M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8996-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Human 293 cells were transfected using Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected DNA mixture consisted of 0.25 μg of the CAT reporter plasmid pCMV128, 0.5 μg of pEGFP-C1 plasmid encoding TAP or TAP mutants, and/or 0.5 μg of pEGFP-N3 plasmid encoding zzp15. Transfection efficiency was determined by including 0.5 μg of pCH110 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as β-galactosidase expression from this vector is not affected by TAP overexpression. The total amount of plasmid DNA transfected in each sample was held constant by adding the appropriate amount of the corresponding parental plasmids without insert, and was brought to a total of 2 μg by adding pBSSKII plasmid when necessary. When Rev-M10 fusions were tested, the transfected DNA mixture consisted of 0.25 μg of the CAT reporter plasmid pCMV128, 0.5 μg of plasmids pCMV-RevM10-TAP or pCMV-RevM10-p15, and/or 0.5 μg of plasmids pEGFP-C1-TAP or pEGFP-N3zzp15. Transfection efficiency was determined by including 0.5 μg of pCH110 plasmid. Plasmids pCMV-Rev and pCMV-RevM10 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and CAT activity was measured as described (24Morency C.A. Neumann J.R. Russian K.O. Biotechnology. 1987; 5: 444-448Google Scholar). Protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blot using anti-GFP or anti-HA antibodies. All DNA templates forin vitro synthesis of labeled RNAs have been described. These were dihydrofolate reductase mRNA, U5ΔSm and U6Δss snRNAs, U6-CTE, and human initiator methionyl tRNA (6Saavedra C.A. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Curr.

Maquat L.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1098-1108PubMed Google Scholar,26Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Ftz-218 and β-globin-247 cDNAs were kindly provided by Hervé Le Hir (Brandeis University). Oocyte injections and analysis of microinjected RNA by denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography were performed as described (6Saavedra C.A. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Quantitation was done by FluorImager (Fuji FLA-2000). The concentration of recombinant proteins in the injected samples is indicated in the figure legends. Previously, we reported an assay that allows quantifying TAP-mediated stimulation of RNA nuclear export in cultured cells (1Herold A. Suyama M. Rodrigues J.P. Braun I.C. Kutay U. Carmo-Fonseca M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8996-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this assay, a TAP protein expression vector is co-transfected with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene encoded by the reporter plasmid pDM138 (22Huang X. Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Grahl K. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2131-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid harbors the CAT coding sequence inserted into an intron, which is not efficiently spliced (22Huang X. Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Grahl K. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2131-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transfected with this plasmid retain the unspliced pre-mRNA in the nucleus, yielding only trace levels of CAT enzyme activity (22Huang X. Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Grahl K. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2131-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of TAP/p15 heterodimers bypass nuclear retention and promotes the export of the inefficiently spliced pre-mRNA, resulting in a 14–16-fold increase in CAT activity (1Herold A. Suyama M. Rodrigues J.P. Braun I.C. Kutay U. Carmo-Fonseca M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8996-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this study, we improved the sensitivity and expanded the dynamic range of the assay by using the reporter plasmid pCMV128 (Fig.2 A). This plasmid is related to pDM138 but has a CMV promoter instead of an SV40 promoter (23McDonald D. Hope T.J. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7232-7236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the basal level of CAT enzyme activity in cells transfected with pCMV128 is 10-fold higher than in cells transfected with pDM138 (not shown). Furthermore, co-expression of TAP/p15 heterodimers with the reporter pCMV128 caused a 44-fold increase in CAT activity (Fig. 2 B). RNase protection analysis confirmed that TAP/p15 heterodimers enhancedcat gene expression by allowing the unspliced transcripts to enter the cytoplasm (not shown). As reported (1Herold A. Suyama M. Rodrigues J.P. Braun I.C. Kutay U. Carmo-Fonseca M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8996-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), overexpression of TAP in the absence of exogenous p15 results in a significant but modest increase of CAT activity, although, the levels of expression of TAP were also reduced (Fig. 2, B and C). Moreover, overexpression of p15 in the absence of exogenous TAP or in the presence of deletion mutants of TAP that cannot bind p15 (TAP ΔNTF2 and TAP 1–372) had no significant effect on CAT expression (Fig.2 B). These results indicate that formation of TAP/p15 heterodimers is required for TAP-dependent stimulation ofcat gene expression. These results also indicate that in cells overexpressing TAP, p15 becomes limiting, and vice versa, and thus no large pools of free TAP or p15 exist in vivo. Using pCMV128 as a reporter we have investigated the role of TAP domains in RNA export. Tested TAP mutants include a deletion of the first 60 amino acids (TAP-(61–619)) and deletions of the RBD, the LRR, the NTF2-like and the UBA-like domains (TAP ΔRBD, TAP ΔLRR, TAP ΔNTF2, and TAP ΔUBA) (Fig. 1 and TableI). TAP fragments lacking the entire C-terminal half (TAP-(1–372)) or the N-terminal half (TAP-(371–619)) were included as negative controls. All tested TAP mutants localize within the nucleus when expressed in HeLa cells, with the exception of TAP fragment 371–619, which distributes between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Ref. 9Bachi A.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were developed to the following peptide regions of rat C5a: amino-terminal region (A), residues 1-16; middle region (M), residues 17-36; and the carboxyl-terminal region (C), residues 58-77. With rat neutrophils, the chemotactic activity of rat C5a was significantly inhibited by antibodies with the following rank order: anti-C > anti-M >> anti-A. In vivo, antibodies to the M and C (but not A) regions of C5a were protective in experimental sepsis, as determined by survival over a 10-day period, in a dose-dependent manner. The relative protective efficacies of anti-C5a preparations (in descending order of efficacy) were anti-C > anti-M >> anti-A. In CLP rats, a delay in infusion of antibodies, which were injected at 6 or 12 h after CLP, still resulted in significant improvement in survival rates. These in vivo and in vitro data suggest that there are optimal targets on C5a for blockade during sepsis and that delayed infusion of anti-C5a antibody until after onset of clinical evidence of sepsis still provides protective effects."
https://openalex.org/W2131088469,"A novel protein, proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF), has been isolated from the urine of patients with pancreatic cancer and is capable of inducing muscle proteolysis in vitro. Only adult skeletal muscle and liver exhibit substantial binding of PIF. We have investigated the effect of PIF on hepatic gene expression. Primary cultures of human hepatocytes and the human cell line HepG2 were incubated in the presence of PIF to assess its effects on hepatic transcription factors, proinflammatory cytokine production, and acute phase proteins. PIF activates both the transcription factors NF-kB and STAT3, which result in the increased production of IL-8, IL-6, and C-reactive protein and the decreased production of transferrin. The function of PIF, beyond muscle degradation, is unknown but here we show that it is involved in hepatic gene expression, and is thus likely to be involved in the proinflammatory response observed in cachexia. These results may also suggest a potential role for PIF during embryonic development. The expression of PIF peaks during the embryonic period E8 to E9, a stage that is crucial in the development of skeletal muscle and liver and during which both NF-kB and STAT3 activation can also be observed."
https://openalex.org/W2019252125,"Glucocorticoids (GC) have pronounced effects on metabolism, differentiation, proliferation, and cell survival (1). In certain lymphocytes and lymphocyte-related malignancies, GC inhibit proliferation and induce apoptotic cell death, which has led to their extensive use in the therapy of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders (2). Most of these effects result from regulation of gene expression via the GC receptor (GR), a ligand-activated transcription factor (3). Although hundreds of genes are regulated by GC (1), how certain biological GC effects relate to individual gene regulation remains enigmatic. To address this question with respect to GC-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, we applied DNA chip technology (4, 5) to determine gene expression profiles in proliferating and G1/G0-arrested (by conditional expression of the CDK inhibitor p16/INK4a) acute lymphoblastic T cells undergoing GC-induced apoptosis. Of 7074 genes tested, 163 were found to be regulated by dexamethasone in the first 8 h in proliferating cells and 66 genes in G1/G0-arrested cells. An almost nonoverlapping set of genes (i.e., only eight genes) was coordinately regulated in proliferating and arrested cells. Analysis of the regulated genes supports the concept that GC-induced apoptosis results from positive GR autoregulation entailing persistent down-regulation of metabolic pathways critical for survival"
https://openalex.org/W2015334422,"To elucidate the molecular basis of muscle atrophy, we have performed the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) method with control and immobilized muscles of 10 rats. The genes that expressed >0.5% in muscle are involved in the following three functions: 1) contraction (troponin I, C and T; myosin light chain 1-3; actin; tropomyosin; and parvalbumin), 2) energy metabolism (cytochrome c oxidase I and III, creatine kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate mutase, ATPase 6, and aldolase A), and 3) housekeeping (lens epithelial protein). Muscle atrophy appears to be caused by changes in mRNA levels of specific regulators of proteolysis, protein synthesis, and contractile apparatus assembling, such as polyubiquitin, elongation factor 2, and nebulin. Immobilization has produced a decrease more than threefold in gene expression of enzymes involved in energy metabolism, especially ATPase, cytochrome c oxidase, NADH dehydrogenase, and protein phosphatase 1. Differential gene expressions of selenoprotein W and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, which can be involved in oxidative stress, were also observed. Other genes with various functions, such as cholesterol metabolism and growth factors, were also differentially expressed. Moreover, novel genes regulated by immobilization were discovered. Thus, the current study allows a better understanding of global muscle characteristics and the molecular mechanisms of sedentarity and sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2114521612,"In diseases associated with neuronal degeneration, such as Alzheimer's or cerebral ischemia, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is pathologically elevated. It is still unclear, however, under which conditions Ca2+ induces either apoptotic or necrotic neuronal cell death. Studying respiration and morphology of rat brain mitochondria, we found that extramitochondrial [Ca2+] above 1 M causes reversible release of cytochrome c, a key trigger of apoptosis. This event was NO-independent but required Ca2+ influx into the mitochondrial matrix. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), widely thought to underlie cytochrome c release, was not involved. In contrast to noncerebral tissue, only relatively high [Ca2+] (is approximately equal to 200 M) opened PTP and ruptured mitochondria. Our findings might reflect a fundamental mechanism to protect postmitotic neuronal tissue against necrotic devastation and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2153340364,"Reduced glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role as an intracellular defense system providing detoxification of a broad spectrum of reactive species and their excretion as water-soluble conjugates. Conjugation of GSH with electrophiles is catalyzed by GSH S-transferases (GST), which constitute a broad family of phase II isoenzymes. Two of the GST encoding genes, GSTM1 (mu) and GSTT1 (theta), have a null genotype due to their homozygous deletion that results in lack of active protein. Polymorphisms within GSTT1 and especially GSTM1 have often been associated with cancer in various organs as well as with elevated levels of DNA adducts in various cell types. We recently demonstrated that DNA adducts are consistently detectable in smooth muscle cells (SMC) of human abdominal aorta affected by atherosclerotic lesions. Here we provide evidence that levels of adducts to SMC DNA from atherosclerotic lesions are consistently increased in individuals having the null GSTM1 genotype, whereas no association was established with the GSTT1 polymorphism. The influence of GSTM1 deletion was better expressed in never-smokers and ex-smokers than in current smokers. These findings bear relevance to the epidemiology of atherosclerosis and suggest that metabolic polymorphisms may contribute to the interindividual variability in susceptibility not only to carcinogens, but also to DNA binding atherogens."

Human tonsil-derived T and B lymphocytes express Cx40 and 43; circulating human T, B, and NK lymphocytes express Cx43 and directly transfer between each other a low molecular dye indicative that functional gap junctions exist. We now identify specific properties in the immune system underwritten by gap junctions. Mixed lymphocytes cultured in the presence of two reagents with independent inhibitory action on gap junction communication, a connexin mimetic peptide and 18-alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid, markedly reduced the secretion of IgM, IgG, and IgA. The secretion of these immunoglobulins by purified B cells was also reduced by the two classes of gap junction inhibitors. Complex temporal inhibitory effects on the expression of mRNA encoding interleukins, especially IL-10, were also observed. The results indicate that intercellular signaling across gap junctions is an important component of the mechanisms underlying metabolic cooperation in the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2148895280,"Exon trapping and cDNA selection procedures were used to search for novel genes at human chromosome 11p13, a region previously associated with loss of heterozygosity in epithelial carcinomas. Using these approaches, we found the ESE-2 and ESE-3 genes, coding for ETS domain-containing transcription factors. These genes lie in close proximity to the catalase gene within a ∼200-kilobase genomic interval. ESE-3 mRNA is widely expressed in human tissues with high epithelial content, and immunohistochemical analysis with a newly generated monoclonal antibody revealed that ESE-3 is a nuclear protein expressed exclusively in differentiated epithelial cells and that it is absent in the epithelial carcinomas tested. In transient transfections, ESE-3 behaves as a repressor of the Ras- or phorbol ester-induced transcriptional activation of a subset of promoters that contain ETS and AP-1 binding sites. ESE-3-mediated repression is sequence- and context-dependent and depends both on the presence of high affinity ESE-3 binding sites in combination with AP-1 cis-elements and the arrangement of these sites within a given promoter.

On the other hand, Aop/Yan has been described as a repressor of Pointed-responsive genes (6Wassarman D.A. Therrien M. Rubin G.M. Curr. Opin. Genet.

No mammalian epithelial ortholog of Aop/Yan has been identified yet. It has been proposed that phosphorylation of Aop/Yan by MAP kinases results in its inactivation and nuclear export, thus alleviating repression and allowing the transcriptional activation of Pointed target genes (6Wassarman D.A. Therrien M. Rubin G.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The balance between the activity of these two transcription factors appears to modulate the specificity of the nuclear response to MAPK signaling cascades. ETS proteins have also been shown to interact with each other and with other structurally unrelated transcription factors (see Refs. 3Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutiérrez-Hartman A. Trends Biochem.

In particular, the interaction of ETS proteins with Jun has significant relevance, since ETS binding sites appear in the vicinity of AP-1cis-elements in the promoters of a number of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration, including those of extracellular proteases. This functional interaction results in the transcriptional activation of these genes in response to both extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase MAP kinase signaling cascades (3Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Crawford H.C. Matrisian L.M. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 20-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Borden P.

Paradoxically, similar regulatory elements are present in the promoters of protease inhibitors and genes expressed during epithelial cell differentiation (18Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Campbell C.E.

Genomics. 1999; 55: 88-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), raising the question of how specificity is achieved at the nuclear level. It is plausible that members of the ETS family may be important elements in the generation of target gene specificity. In this regard, transcription factors belonging to a specific group within the ETS family of proteins, such as ESE-1/ESX/JEN/ERT/ELF-3, ELF-5/ESE-2, and more recently EHF/ESE-3, have been implicated in the control of the transcription of epithelial differentiation genes (21Andreoli J.M.

The presence of various members with diverse binding specificities and the distinct expression patterns within the ESE group could be important for the selective control of the expression of epithelial target genes by these ETS transcription factors. Elevated levels of ETS proteins have been also associated with cellular transformation (30Chang C.H. Scott G.K. Kuo W-L. Xiong X. Suzdaltseva Y. Park J.W. Sayre P. Erny K. Collins C. Gray J.W. Benz C.C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1617-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 33Dittmer J. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: F1-F11PubMed Google Scholar). Cancer is the result of a multistep process that is commonly associated with the loss of function of genes required for the maintenance of nonproliferative, differentiated cell fates and whose loss would facilitate tumor survival and/or metastasis. One of the mechanisms that may lead to the haploinsufficiency of such regulatory genes is the deletion of genomic regions containing these genes as a result of the increased genomic instability associated with the transformation process, a mechanism known as allelic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (34Weinberg R.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). We have performed an extensive search for genes at human chromosome 11p13, in a region that has been previously associated with allelic loss of heterozygosity in epithelial carcinomas (see Refs. 34Weinberg R.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 35Reeve A.E. Sin S.A. Raizis A.M. Feinberg A.P. Mol. Cell.

Oncol. 1998; 12: 107-111PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). In particular, LOH at this region is associated with increased metastatic potential, thus suggesting that this region contains genes required for the control of cell migration (36Fong K.M. Zimmerman P.V. Smith P.J. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1994; 10: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As a result of this search, we have found the genes coding for two epithelium-specific ETS transcription factors, which we initially identified as I and J in our study (38Brooks-Wilson, A. R., Buckler, A., Cardon, L., Carey, A. H., Galvin, M., Miller, A., and North, M. (July 11, 2000) U. S. Patent 6,087,485.Google Scholar) and have been later reported as ELF5/ESE-2 and EHF/ESE-3, respectively (26Oettgen P. Kas K. Dube A. Gu X. Grall F. Thamrongsak U. Akbarali Y. Finger E. Boltax J.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2719-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The analysis of EHF/ESE-3 revealed that the expression of this transcription factor is restricted to differentiated epithelial cells, and remarkably, it is absent in epithelial carcinomas originated from the same tissues where this factor is expressed normally. EHF/ESE-3 is a transcriptional repressor of a subset of ETS/AP-1-responsive genes, including the interstitial collagenase gene (matrix metalloproteinase 1; MMP-1) promoter. We suggest that EHF/ESE-3 might be an important regulatory factor in the maintenance of a differentiated phenotype in epithelial cells by modulating the nuclear response to MAP kinase signaling cascades. To generate a physical map for the 11p13 region, we began with searches of publicly available information sources for yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones that best represented the region. Queries of the Whitehead Institute Genome Center's physical map data base yielded multiple CEPH mega-YAC clones that were detected by genetic markers from the region. Each clone was analyzed by STS content mapping with all available markers by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and blotting and by fluorescent in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes. This extensive analysis led to the establishment of a minimal tiling path of clones that appeared to be nonchimeric, stable, and free of deletions. The resulting ∼4-Mb YAC contig encompasses an 8–9-centimorgan interval defined by D11S935 and D11S1776. To increase the map's resolution and utility for gene identification experiments, the minimal set of YACs was then used to identify plasmid-based genomic clones corresponding to the region. DNA samples from YACs purified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis were radiolabeled and used to screen high density filter grids of a human total genomic DNA BAC library (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), as well as a human chromosome 11-specific cosmid library (39Evans G.A. Lewis K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 83: 7821-7825Google Scholar). A subset of the detected clones could subsequently be ordered and oriented by STS content mapping. Overlap relationships between these clones were defined using DIRVISH, and gaps in the contigs were closed by end walking. BAC clones covering the region were subjected to exon trapping (40Buckler A. Chang D.D. Graw S.L. Brook J.D. Haber D.A. Sharp P.A. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4005-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and cDNA selection rounds using a commercial kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to search for coding sequences. Full-length cDNAs corresponding to exon-trapped products or selected cDNAs were cloned, sequenced, and assigned letters as they were identified. cDNA clones containing the full-length J ORF were obtained from a human prostate pDR2 cDNA library (CLONTECH). Partitioning of protein sequences into globular and nonglobular segments was performed using the local compositional complexity measures implemented in the SEG algorithm run with the following optimized parameters: window length, 45; trigger complexity, 3.4; extension complexity, 3.8 (41Wootton J.C. Federhen S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 554-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein data base searches were performed using the PSI-BLAST program (42Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lippman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60532) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis was performed on a continuous 127-amino acid data set derived by concatenating the conserved ETS and SAM/SPM domains. Positions containing gaps within these domains were deleted sitewise. Hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships were constructed using neighbor joining, a distance-based method, and the maximum likelihood methods. Support for neighbor joining topologies was evaluated using bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates, and support for maximum likelihood tree interference utilized quartet puzzling reliability values from 10,000 puzzling steps (analogous to bootstrap replicates) (43Strimmer K. von Haesler A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 964-969Crossref Scopus (2277) Google Scholar). The distance matrix in the neighbor joining tree construction was calculated by two methods: the simple proportional difference and Lake's paralinear distance because of its robustness of interference on data sets having significantly unequal rate effects (44Lake J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1455-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The calculation of the distance matrices, neighbor joining interference of tree topology, and the subsequent bootstrap analysis were implemented in DAMBE (45Xia X. DAMBE: Data Analysis in Molecular Biology and Evolution. Department of Ecology and Biodiversity, University of Hong Kong, 2000Google Scholar). The neighbor joining tree derived from the maximum likelihood distance matrix was used to compute the parameters for the models of substitution and rate heterogeneity. A model of rate heterogeneity with one invariant and eight γ-distributed rate categories was used. A cDNA clone containing the full-length J (EHF/ESE-3b) ORF, was subjected to PCR to construct different clones containing a FLAG epitope either at the 5′ (clone C7132) or at the 3′ (clone F5) ends, that were subcloned into pRC/CMV (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To generate a full-length GST fusion bacterial expression construct (clone pGEX B4), a PCR fragment containing the full-length ORF was subcloned into the PGEX-20T vector, a derivative of PGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A similar approach was used to generate a His-tagged full-length construct in the pProEx-HTB vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). An ESE-1a/ESX expression vector was constructed by performing PCR on an expressed sequence tag containing the full-length ESE1a/ESX ORF (expressed sequence tag 78004; GenBankTM accession number AA 3667460), also inserting a FLAG epitope at the 5′-end, and subcloned into pRC/CMV. The murine ETS-2 and the oncogenic Ras 61L expression vectors, the human collagenase (MMP-1) (−1200 to +63), the (Py)2 Δ56 dE Fos, (PyEts)2 Δ56 dE Fos, and the (Py + 6F)2 Δ56 dE Fos luciferase reporter constructs have been described previously (46Pankov R.

To make the TIMP-1 Δ56 dE Fos luciferase reporter, the HT-1 sequence (see electrophoretic mobility shift assay probes below) was subcloned upstream of the Δ56 dE Fos minimal promoter (48Galang C.K.

The colon HCT 15, COLO 205, prostate LNCaP FGC 10, and lung NCI H-1299 adenocarcinoma cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies). COS-7 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented as above. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma. Cells were kept at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, 95% air. Plasmids for transfections were isolated by alkaline lysis, RNase A treatment, and polyethyleneglycol precipitation (51Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar), followed by a single centrifugation through a CsCl gradient. HCT-15 cells were transfected by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) as recommended by the manufacturer. After 5 h, the transfection mixture was removed, and RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum was added to the cells. After 24 h, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml PMA for 12 h, and the luciferase activity of the cell extracts was analyzed in a 3010 Luminometer (Analytical Bioluminiscence, Ann Arbor, MI) using a commercially available reagent kit (Analytical Bioluminiscence). For the Ras 61L co-transfections, cell lysates were collected 24 h after the addition of fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Relative luciferase units were normalized according to the protein concentration of the extracts. The transfection experiments shown were done in triplicate and repeated at least three different times. A full-length J cDNA fragment was radiolabeled with 32P using the Prime-It kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes containing polyadenylated human tissue mRNAs (CLONTECH) or 20 μg of total RNA extracted from epithelial cell lines were hybridized to the 32P-labeled DNA probe by using RapidHyb (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. Filters were washed up to 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), analyzed in a Storm PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and digital images were finally processed in Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) to elaborate the figures. Bacterial expression constructs were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and cultures at A600 = 0.5–0.6 were induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactoside, for 4 h at 37 °C. His tag full-length ESE-3 was purified using the His·Bind resin and buffer kit, following the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen, Madison, WI). GST-full-length ESE-3 was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats immunized with denatured purified His-tagged ESE-3 were tested for ESE-3-reactive antisera using Western blots. Rat 362, whose serum showed the highest immunoreactivity, was sacrificed, and spleen cells were fused to the SP2 mouse myeloma (ATCC) using standard procedures (52Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Positive cloned hybridomas were selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and were further tested for specificity by performing sequential immunoprecipitations and Western blots (52Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) with the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) on cell extracts from COS7 cells transfected with EHF/ESE-3b, ESE1a/ESX, and ETS-2 and by using immunocytochemical analysis on the prostate cell line LNCaP FGC 10. The mAb 5A5.5 was shown to detect EHF/ESE-3b with high specificity and did not show any cross-reactivity with the closest human homolog ESX/ESE-1. The epitope recognized by the 5A5.5 mAb is not included in either conserved domain (ETS or SAM) of the EHF/ESE-3b protein (not shown). Neutral buffered formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissues were sectioned (6 μm), baked on Superfrost glass slides (Fisher) at 65 °C for 2 h, rehydrated, and treated with antigen unmasking solution as recommended by the manufacturer (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Immunohistochemistry was carried out by using either the mAb 5A5.5-containing culture supernatant or the rat myeloma SP2 culture supernatant as a control, followed by incubation with a biotinylated mouse anti Rat mAb (DAKO) and a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (DAKO). Detection was performed with the Immunopure Metal Enhanced DAB Substrate Kit (Pierce), and after the detection reaction was completed (10 min to 2 h), slides were subjected to a light hematoxilin stain (Harris hematoxilin 1:10 in water for 20 s), rinsed in tap water, dehydrated, and mounted with DPX (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Digital images were captured with a Polaroid DMC1 digital camera (Polaroid, Cambridge, MA) and imported into Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems) to elaborate the figures. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described (53Tugores A. Alonso M.A. Sanchez-Madrid F. Landázuri M.O. J. Immunol. 1992; 269: 30789-30797Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were dried and analyzed as described above for Northern blots. The sequences for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay probes containing the ETS sites on the ESE-3 promoter and their variants are shown in Fig. 5 D. The full sequence of the ETS-AP-1 tandem on the human TIMP-1 gene promoter (HT1) is TGGGTGGATGAGTAATGCATCCAGGAAGCCTGGAGGCCTGTGGTTT (sites are underlined) (18Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Campbell C.E.

https://openalex.org/W2032034078,"Activation of RhoA GTPase causes actin filament bundling into stress fibers, integrin clustering, and focal adhesion formation through its action on actin cytoskeleton organization. RhoA also regulates transcriptional activity of serum response factor (SRF). Recent studies in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts have shown that SRF activation by RhoA does not require an organized cytoskeleton and may be regulated by G-actin level. In cardiac myocytes, the organization of actin fibers into myofibrils is one of the primary characteristics of cardiac differentiation and hypertrophy. The primary purpose of this study was to examine if RhoA regulates SRF-dependent gene expression in neonatal cardiomyocytes in a manner different from that observed in fibroblasts. Our results show that RhoA-dependent skeletal alpha-actin promoter activation requires beta1 integrin and a functional cytoskeleton in cardiomyocytes but not in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Activation of the alpha-actin promoter by RhoA is greatly potentiated (up to 15-fold) by co-expression of the integrin beta1A or beta1D isoform but is significantly reduced by 70% with a co-expressed dominant negative mutant of beta1 integrin. Furthermore, clustering of beta1 integrin with anti-beta1 integrin antibodies potentiates synergistic RhoA and beta1 integrin activation of the alpha-actin promoter. Cytochalasin D and latrunculin B, inhibitors of actin polymerization, significantly reduced RhoA-induced activation of the alpha-actin promoter. Jasplakinolide, an actin polymerizing agent, mimics the synergistic effect of RhoA and beta1 integrin on the actin promoter. These observations support the concept that RhoA regulates SRF-dependent cardiac gene expression through cross-talk with beta1 integrin signal pathway via an organized actin cytoskeleton."

By antisense oligonucleotide-induced inhibition of calsenilin/DREAM/KChIP3 synthesis, apoptosis induced by Fas, Ca2+-ionophore, or thapsigargin is attenuated. Conversely, calsenilin/DREAM/KChIP3 expression induced the morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis, including cell shrinkage, DNA laddering, and caspase activation. Calsenilin/DREAM/KChIP3-induced apoptosis was suppressed by caspase inhibitor Z-VAD and by Bcl-XL, and was potentiated by increasing cytosolic Ca2+, expression of Swedish amyloid precursor protein mutant (APPSW) or presenilin 2 (PS2), but not by a PS2 deletion lacking its C-terminus (PS2/411stop). In addition, calsenilin/DREAM/KChIP3 expression increased Ab42 production in cells expressing APPsw, which was potentiated by PS2, but not by PS2/411stop, which suggests a role for apoptosis-associated Ab42 production of calsenilin/DREAM/KChIP3."
https://openalex.org/W4240264940,"Sphingomyelinase (SMase) stimulation and subsequent ceramide generation are suggested to be involved in signal transduction of stress-induced apoptosis. We now show that apoptosis of human macrophages (MPhi) and fibroblasts initiated by oxidized low density lipoproteins (minimally modified LDL, mmLDL) is associated with an increase in acid SMase (aSMase, E.C. 3.1.4.12) expression and ceramide concentration. Application of a novel, potent, and specific inhibitor of aSMase expression (NB6) diminished the effects of mmLDL and C6-ceramide treatment by inhibiting transcription via Sp1 and AP-2. Moreover, apoptosis was abolished after mmLDL and C6-ceramide treatment of hereditary aSMase-deficient fibroblasts (from Niemann-Pick patients). We suggest that in mmLDL-initiated apoptosis 1) enhanced ceramide generation via aSMase appears to be required as well as 2) a positive feedback control of aSMase expression by the increase in intracellular ceramide concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2000585979,"Maintenance of methylation patterns in the mammalian genome by DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (DNAMeTase) is required for normal cell and tissue function. Inhibition of DNAMeTase in cultured cells induces the expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor critical for cells to enter replicative senescence. We investigated the effects of DNAMeTase inhibition in normal human fibroblasts and found that it induces an irreversible growth arrest. Cells arrested by DNAMeTase inhibition became enlarged and had a flat morphology, exhibited an increased expression of collagenase and p21, and the DNA synthesis block could be overcome by the introduction of the SV40 large T antigen, all characteristics of senescent cells. In contrast, normal human fibroblasts lacking a functional p21 gene fail to undergo cell cycle arrest following DNAMeTase inhibition, indicating that p21 is an essential component of this arrest. Furthermore, DNAMeTase activity was reduced as cells approached the end of their proliferative potential. These data suggest that DNAMeTase could be an integral part of the mechanisms by which cells count the number of cell divisions completed and initiate a signaling cascade that ultimately results in the senescent phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2110164669,"c-Fos, a transcription factor that constitutes DNA-binding AP-1 complexes, regulates gene expression that promotes long-lasting cellular changes. We show that, in addition to its transcription factor activity, c-Fos regulates the metabolism of phospholipids cytoplasmically by an AP-1-independent activity. Two waves of c-Fos expression that promote subsequent waves of stimulation of 32P-orthophosphate incorporation into phospholipids are evidenced in quiescent cultured fibroblasts induced to re-enter the cell cycle. The first wave of c-Fos expression peaks at 7.5 min and returns to control levels by 15 min. The second wave starts by 30 min and remains elevated at 120 min. In the first wave, the lipids that incorporate 32P are predominantly second-messenger polyphosphoinositides (PIP, PIP2, PIP3); whereas in the second wave, membrane-biogenesis-related lipids (PI, PE, PA), become radioactive. Both waves of phospholipid activation depend on c-Fos expression. It is interesting that a peptide that blocks AP-1 nuclear import does not affect phospholipid activation. Immunocytochemical examination showed c-Fos immunoreactivity associated to the endoplasmic reticulum. We conclude that c-Fos, rapidly induced upon cell stimulation, associates to the endoplasmic reticulum where it first regulates the synthesis/ replenishment of phospholipids required for signal transduction pathways and subsequently regulates enzymes involved in the genesis of new membrane necessary for cell growth."

In this study, we characterized the extremely GC-rich promoter of the human gene for MAZ, which is known as a housekeeping gene. Unique symmetrical motifs in the promoter region (nucleotides −383 to −334) were essential for the expression of the gene for MAZ, whereas an upstream silencer element (nucleotides −784 to −612) was found to act in a position-dependent but orientation-independent manner.

(Myc-associated zinc finger protein) wild type chloramphenicol acetyltransferase tricostatin A nucleotides glutathioneS-transferase histone deacetylase DNA methyltransferase 1 Regulation of the expression of many genes is mediated by the binding of transcription factors to cis-elements in their promoter regions. The promoter regions of many eukaryotic genes contain GC-rich sequences (1Courey A.J. Tjian R. Yamamoto K.R. McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar) and some of the most widely distributed promoter elements are GC boxes and related motifs. The zinc finger proteins Sp1 and MAZ1(Myc-associated zinc finger protein) are transcription factors that bind to GC-rich sequences, namely GGGCGG and GGGAGGG, respectively, to activate the expression of various target genes.Sp1 was originally characterized as a ubiquitous transcription factor, consisting of 778 amino acids, that recognized GC-rich sequences in the early promoter of simian virus 40 (2, 3). The DNA-binding domain of Sp1 consists of three contiguous C2H2-type zinc fingers (4Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region contains two serine- and threonine-rich domains and two glutamine-rich domains, which are essential for transcriptional activity (5Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of Sp1 is involved in synergistic activation and interactions with other transcription factors. Sp1 is considered to be a constitutively expressed transcription factor and has been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of housekeeping genes, tissue-specific genes, and genes involved in the regulation of growth (6Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Sp1 is a phosphorylated (7Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R.

Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), after displaying a wide range of abnormalities. Some of the embryos appeared as an undifferentiated mass of cells, whereas others had all the typical hallmarks of early embryogenesis, such as a developing heart, eyes, optic vesicles, somites, erythroid cells, and extra-embryonic tissues (18Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that Sp1 is essential for the differentiation of embryonal stem cells after day 10 of development.MAZ was first identified as a transcription factor that bound to a GA box (GGGAGGG) at the ME1a1 site of the c-myc promoter and to the CT element of the c-myc gene (19Bossone S.A.

MAZ might be involved in the termination of transcription by interrupting elongation by RNA polymerase II (29Yonaha M. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 593-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).The promoter region of the gene for MAZ has features typical of the promoter of a housekeeping gene, namely a high G+C content, a high frequency of CpG (where p stands for “phosphoric residue”) dinucleotides, the absence of canonical TATA boxes, and multiple sites for initiation of transcription (30Song J. Murakami H. Yang Z.Q. Koga C. Adati N. Murata T. Geltinger C. Saito-Ohara F. Ikeuchi T. Matsumura M. Itakura K. Kanazawa I. Sun K. Yokoyama K.K.

Moreover, the gene is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (22Song J. Murakami H. Tsutsui H. Tang X. Matsumura M. Itakura K. Kanazawa I. Sun K. Yokoyama K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20603-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).We have attempted to clarify some aspects of the relationship between the factors that bind to GC-rich cis-elements and the promoters of housekeeping genes with a high G+C content. A previous study showed that Sp1 binds to GC-rich DNA sequences in nucleosomes (32Li B. Adams C.C. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7756-7763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the large coactivator complex known as CRSP (cofactor required for activation of Sp1) stimulates Sp1-mediated transcription (33Ryu S. Zhou S. Ladurner A.G. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 397: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Both Sp1 and MAZ can exert positive and negative control over the expression of target genes. Thus, regulation by individual DNA-binding factors seems to be coordinated via recruitment of other factors that participate in the regulated expression of target genes and via recognition of the modification of nucleotide sequences, for example, by methylation or demethylation and acetylation or deacetylation (34Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 35Kuo M.H. Allis C.D.

Genet. 1999; 23: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The binding affinities of transcription factors for individual target sequences are likely to be essential parameters in the regulation of gene expression, together with the recruitment of related factors.We demonstrate here a possible mechanism for regulation of the expression of the human gene for MAZ. The mechanism involves the recruitment of different repressors by two different DNA-binding factors, Sp1 and MAZ, that interact with the samecis-elements. Our results indicate that deacetylation and methylation might be involved in the regulation of a single gene via the binding of different zinc finger proteins.DISCUSSIONThe promoter regions of human housekeeping genes are usually GC-rich, and, by definition, these genes are expressed ubiquitously, as is, for example, the human gene for MAZ (22Song J. Murakami H. Tsutsui H. Tang X. Matsumura M. Itakura K. Kanazawa I. Sun K. Yokoyama K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20603-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30Song J. Murakami H. Yang Z.Q. Koga C. Adati N. Murata T. Geltinger C. Saito-Ohara F. Ikeuchi T. Matsumura M. Itakura K. Kanazawa I. Sun K. Yokoyama K.K. Genomics. 1998; 52: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Many GC-richcis-elements can be found in the promoters of housekeeping genes, and they might be expected to regulate the transcription of various genes. In this study, we analyzed the GC-rich promoter of the human gene for MAZ in an attempt to identify the role of GC-richcis-elements in the regulation of transcription of this gene.The minimal MAZ promoter was located between nt −383 and +259 (Fig.2 A). We showed that a 135-base pair sequence, from nt −383 to −248 in the minimal promoter region of the gene for MAZ was associated with the promoter activity. Further studies indicated that the region from nt −383 to −334 was critical for the promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). The G+C content of this region is relatively low, and there are two CAAC elements and two CTTC elements within this region (Fig. 2 C). The region containing these four elements is 33 base pairs long, with an average G+C content of only 49%, the lowest G+C content in the extremely GC-rich promoter region of the gene for MAZ. It has been reported that, in some promoters, the proximal upstream region is extremely GC-rich, whereas the distal region is AT-rich (46Davies I.J. Drabble W.T. Microbiology ( Reading ). 1996; 142: 2429-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 47Lee S.J. Bahk Y.Y. Yun D.H. Lee H.J. Lee Y.H. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G.

Lauber A.H. Sandhu N.P. Subramaniam M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 63-96PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that a stretch of GC-rich sequences is followed by AT-rich sequences in some promoters (49Spelsberg T.C. Lauber A.H. Sandhu N.P. Subramaniam M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 63-96PubMed Google Scholar). A specific cis-element in the promoter region of the c-myc gene is localized in an AT-rich domain that is flanked by GC-rich sequences (49Spelsberg T.C. Lauber A.H. Sandhu N.P. Subramaniam M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 63-96PubMed Google Scholar). The cited studies suggest that relatively AT-rich elements in extremely GC-rich sequences might be recognition sites for transcription factors that are associated with the initiation of transcription (49Spelsberg T.C. Lauber A.H. Sandhu N.P. Subramaniam M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 63-96PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these motifs are critical for the activity of the promoter of the gene for MAZ, we examined a series of constructs with mutations in these motifs. As shown in Fig. 2 D, two symmetric CAAC elements and two CTTC symmetric elements were required for basal transcriptional activity, and the contribution of each element to the total transcriptional activity was lower than that of all the elements together. Both CAAC and CTTC elements have been found in the promoters of other genes, such as the gene for the α-myosin heavy chain, the gene for hydroxymethylbilane synthase, the gene for myosin light chain 2, and the gene for lactoferrin, and some of these sites have been shown to be important for promoter activity (42Gupta M. Zak R. Libermann T.A. Gupta M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7243-7258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Yoo H.W. Warner C.A. Chen C.H. Desnick R.J.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1969-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The factors that bind to the CAAC and/or CTTC elements in the minimal MAZ promoter remain to be identified.The consensus sequence of MAZ-binding sites is very similar to that of Sp1-binding sites. The GC-rich minimal promoter of the gene for MAZ contains multiple binding sites for Sp1 and MAZ. We found that Sp1 bound to consensus Sp1-binding sites as well as to consensus MAZ-binding sites. Similarly, MAZ bound to the consensus binding sites for both MAZ and Sp1 (Fig. 3). The results of our gel shift assays indicated that both Sp1 and MAZ recognized the samecis-elements in the MAZ promoter. It has been reported that a GC-rich motif in the c-myc promoter region is a high affinity binding site for both MAZ and Sp1 (50DesJardins E. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5710-5724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Sp1 binds to a series of GC-rich nucleotide sequences as well as to the consensus Sp1-binding site (51Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The fact that MAZ and Sp1 shared binding sites indicates that the regulatory activity of some GC-rich cis-elements is consistent with cooperative interactions by multiple transcription factors, such as zinc finger proteins, with the same or overlapping cis-elements.The binding of both Sp1 and MAZ to the same cis-elements in the promoter region of the gene for MAZ might regulate transcription of the gene. Both Sp1 and MAZ suppressed transcription from the MAZ promoter (Fig. 4). There are seven consensus binding sites for Sp1 and nine consensus binding sites for MAZ in the minimal promoter region of the gene for MAZ. We tried to identify the cis-elements that are involved in repression of the transcription of the gene for MAZ, and we found that the extent of repression by Sp1 and by MAZ was reduced only when all of the consensus binding sites for Sp1 and MAZ had been mutated (pMAZCAT3-m8; Fig. 5). However, we did not detect enhanced expression of the mutated construct (pMAZCAT3-m8), as compared with that of the wild type construct, even when the possible consensus GC-rich motifs in the promoter regions of the MAZ gene were mutated (Fig. 5). We do not know the exact reason why the overexpression of Sp1 or MAZ stimulated the expression of pMAZCAT3-m8. One possible explanation is that the weak binding sites of Sp1 or MAZ are still present in pMAZCAT3-m8, which might be the other GC-rich sequences in the promoter region, and are functional for the residual activity of repression. In fact, it has been reported that Sp1 or MAZ binds other GC-rich elements besides the consensus motifs (27Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4417-4430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 51Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Further studies are required for the identification of other motifs for Sp1 and MAZ. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that the overexpression of Sp1 and MAZ might titrate the coactivators or general transcription factors and result in the repression of the MAZ promoter. Further studies are required to answer these questions.The activity of the promoter was repressed when any of the wild type binding sites remained (pMAZCAT3-m1–pMAZCAT3-m7; Fig. 5), indicating that almost all of the cis-elements were involved in repression. Autorepression of the gene for MAZ by MAZ itself also indicates that negative feedback might possibly be involved in the control of the expression of housekeeping genes. Both the multiple GC-rich cis-elements and the upstream silencer element were involved in the negative regulation of the gene for MAZ, indicating that suppression of transcription of this gene is the major basal regulatory mechanism that controls its expression.Both Sp1 and MAZ repressed the activity of the gene for MAZ through binding to the same cis-elements. We tried to determine whether the repression by Sp1 and by MAZ might be linked, but the results failed to reveal any interaction between Sp1 and MAZ (data not shown). Repression by Sp1 and repression by MAZ were independent phenomena, even though both involved the same GC-richcis-elements. We identified novel repressive domains in both Sp1 and MAZ. The carboxyl-terminal region of Sp1 (amino acids 622–778) and amino acids 127–292 of MAZ were responsible for the respective repressive activities (Fig. 6, A and B). Moreover, repression was also dependent on the zinc finger domains of both Sp1 and MAZ, which were essential for binding to DNA (Fig. 6,A and B). It is possible that Sp1 and MAZ might bind to cis-elements through their zinc finger motifs, recruiting other factors through their repression domains.Histone deacetylases act negatively to regulate the expression of many genes (52Yang W.M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether histone deacetylases might be involved in repression of the gene for MAZ. HeLa cells were transfected with pCMV-Sp1 or pCMV-MAZ in the presence and absence of TSA, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases. Only repression by MAZ was released in the presence of TSA, whereas the repression by Sp1 was insensitive to treatment with TSA (Figs. 7 A and8 A). Thus, it appears that histone deacetylases are involved in repression by MAZ. We confirmed this possibility by measuring HDAC activity of immunoprecipitated complexes that contained MAZ. The HDAC activity of complexes was about five times higher than that of control immunoprecipitates, and the HDAC activity of the former complexes was repressed in the presence of TSA (Fig. 7 B). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells indicated that MAZ could recruit proteins that included HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 to form a multiple protein complex (Fig. 7 C).We found that the action of Sp1 was insensitive to TSA and that HDAC1 had no effect on repression by Sp1 (Fig. 8 A). Thus, repression mediated by Sp1 appeared to be independent of HDACs. It has been reported that methylation plays an important role in the suppression of transcription, and the interaction of Sp1 with MeCP2 has also been reported (55Kudo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5492-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We examined whether methylation might be involved in repression of the gene for MAZ and found that repression by Sp1 was sensitive to 5-azacytidine, a specific inhibitor of methylation (Fig. 8 B). The ectopic expression of DNMT1 enhanced repression by Sp1, whereas 5-azacytidine reversed the repression induced by Sp1 and DNMT1 (Fig. 8 C). Furthermore, it is highly possible that DNMT1 is recruited by Sp1 (Fig. 8 D). Therefore, DNMT1 appeared to play a role in the repression mediated by Sp1.We have demonstrated here a possible mechanism for the down-regulation and autorepression of a human housekeeping gene, namely the gene for MAZ, through the recruitment of different repressors by two different DNA-binding proteins, Sp1 and MAZ, which interact with the samecis-elements (Fig. 9). Our data suggest that different levels of suppression of the transcription of this housekeeping gene might be responsible for the different levels of expression of the gene in different tissues. Moreover, deacetylation and methylation appear to play distinct roles in the regulation of a single gene, namely the human gene for MAZ, in a process that is mediated by different DNA-binding transcription factors. Regulation of the expression of many genes is mediated by the binding of transcription factors to cis-elements in their promoter regions. The promoter regions of many eukaryotic genes contain GC-rich sequences (1Courey A.J. Tjian R. Yamamoto K.R. McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar) and some of the most widely distributed promoter elements are GC boxes and related motifs. The zinc finger proteins Sp1 and MAZ1(Myc-associated zinc finger protein) are transcription factors that bind to GC-rich sequences, namely GGGCGG and GGGAGGG, respectively, to activate the expression of various target genes. Sp1 was originally characterized as a ubiquitous transcription factor, consisting of 778 amino acids, that recognized GC-rich sequences in the early promoter of simian virus 40 (2, 3). The DNA-binding domain of Sp1 consists of three contiguous C2H2-type zinc fingers (4Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region contains two serine- and threonine-rich domains and two glutamine-rich domains, which are essential for transcriptional activity (5Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of Sp1 is involved in synergistic activation and interactions with other transcription factors. Sp1 is considered to be a constitutively expressed transcription factor and has been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of housekeeping genes, tissue-specific genes, and genes involved in the regulation of growth (6Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Sp1 is a phosphorylated (7Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R.

https://openalex.org/W2045059903,"Treatment of transplanted patients with cyclosporin A (CSA) may cause adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity and hypertension. As CSA is known to induce oxidative stress in several tissues, it may cause vascular problems by triggering oxidative stress in endothelial cells (EC). However, oxidative stress has been reported for acute exposure to CSA concentrations exceeding its clinical range, whereas immunosuppression requires life-long treatment with therapeutic concentrations. We therefore compared the effects of 21 h pharmacological (200 microM) vs. 8 days clinical (0.5-2.5 microM) doses of CSA on cultured human EC. Pharmacological doses of CSA cause a decrease in cell density via apoptosis and a down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. However, these effects are independent of CSA-induced oxidative stress. In contrast, therapeutic concentrations of CSA cause Bcl-2 up-regulation and modification of EC morphology, both effects blocked by antioxidants. Therefore, a low level of oxidants may act in EC as second messengers that up-regulate Bcl-2, thus promoting survival of impaired EC. Our data suggest that the oxidative stress induced by clinical concentrations of CSA may be involved in the adverse effects of the drug on the vascular system of transplanted patients via an adaptive response involving Bcl-2 up-regulation rather than an apoptotic process"
https://openalex.org/W2093018084,"Although the role of calcium (Ca2+) in the signal transduction and pathobiology of the exocrine pancreas is firmly established, the role of magnesium (Mg2+) remains unclear. We have characterized the intracellular distribution of Mg2+ in response to hormone stimulation in isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells and studied the role of Mg2+ in modulating Ca2+ signaling using microspectrofluorometry and digital imaging of Ca2+- or Mg2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes as well as Mg2+-sensitive intracellular microelectrodes. Our results indicate that an increase in intracellular Mg2+ concentrations reduced the cholecystokinin (CCK) -induced Ca2+ oscillations by inhibiting the capacitive Ca2+ influx. An intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, on the other hand, was paralleled by a decrease in [Mg2+]i, which was reversible upon hormone withdrawal independent of the electrochemical gradients for Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, and K+, and not caused by Mg2+ efflux from acinar cells. In an attempt to characterize possible Mg2+ stores that would explain the reversible, hormone-induced intracellular Mg2+ movements, we ruled out mitochondria or ATP as potential Mg2+ buffers and found that the CCK-induced [Mg2+]i decrease was initiated at the basolateral part of the acinar cells, where most of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is located, and progressed from there toward the apical pole of the acinar cells in an antiparallel fashion to Ca2+ waves. These experiments represent the first characterization of intracellular Mg2+ movements in the exocrine pancreas, provide evidence for possible Mg2+ stores in the ER, and indicate that the spatial and temporal distribution of intracellular Mg concentrations profoundly affects acinar cell Ca2+ signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2121807107,"Platelet factor 4 (PF-4) is a CXC-chemokine with strong anti-angiogenic properties. We have shown previously that PF-4 inhibits angiogenesis by associating directly with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), inhibiting its dimerization, and blocking FGF-2 binding to endothelial cells. We now have characterized a small peptide domain (PF-447-70) derived from the C-terminus of PF-4, which conserves anti-angiogenic effects of the parent protein. PF-447-70 inhibited internalization of 125I-FGF-2 by endothelial cells in a time-dependent manner. The peptide reduced FGF-2-stimulated cell migration to control levels in wounded monolayers of bovine capillary endothelial cells. PF-447-70 also reduced FGF-2 induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2, which are essential for migration and survival of endothelial cells. In a serum-free ex vivo angiogenesis assay, the peptide blocked microvessel outgrowth by 89%. A single amino acid substitution within PF-447-70 abolished all inhibitory activities. To simulate a real anti-angiogenic treatment situation, we administered PF-447-70 systemically to mice implanted subcutaneously with FGF-2 containing gelatin sponges with the result of sparse, scattered, and immature vessel growth. The small peptide fragment derived from the angio-inhibitory CXC-chemokine PF-4 might be used as a starting point to develop anti-angiogenic designer drugs for angiogenesis-dependent pathologies such as cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2132758291,"Mitochondrial localization of p53 has been observed in several cell systems, but an understanding of its organelle-based physiological activity remains incomplete. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mitochondrial DNA genomic response to dominant-negative p53 mutant miniprotein (p53DD) fused to a mitochondrial import signal. Constructs were generated to express mitochondrial targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP) or dominant-negative mutant p53 miniprotein (m53DD) by in-frame fusion to the signal peptide sequence of murine Cox8l. Control cytosolic vectors (cEGFP, c53DD) had the signal sequence placed in antisense orientation. NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with these vectors in various combinations. Mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) expression and fluorochrome staining with Mitotracker Red CMXRos (DeltaPsim) were decreased in cells expressing m53DD. Both alterations were specific for mitochondrial import competence (e.g., m53DD vs. c53DD) as well as the passenger protein (e.g., m53DD vs. mEGFP). The normal functional state of mitochondria was restored with PK11195, a specific ligand of the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. Negative dominance of m53DD on 16S rRNA expression and CMXRos staining, and rescue of these parameters with PK11195, imply a direct positive effect of p53 on mitochondrial biogenesis and function."
https://openalex.org/W2121923215,"The chemokine RANTES/CCL5 is a proinflammatory agent produced by a variety of tissues in response to specific stimuli. In human monocytes, RANTES/CCL5 transcription is up-regulated rapidly and transiently in response to LPS. We describe here two regions that help control LPS-driven transcription from the human RANTES/CCL5 promoter in monocytic cells. These sites were analyzed by using DNase I footprinting, transient transfection assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and EMSA. RANTES site E (R(E), -125/-99) constitutively binds C/EBP proteins in monocytic Mono Mac 6 cells. Mutation of region R(E) led to a significant (40%–50%) reduction in LPS-induced promoter reporter activity. Region R(AB) is composed of tandem κB-like elements R(A) and R(B) (-73/-34). These sites working in concert act as an LPS-responsive promoter module. R(A) constitutively binds Sp1, and Rel p50/p65 following LPS stimulation. Either factor can mediate transcriptional effects at R(A). Induced Rel p50/p50 binding to site R(B) is required for LPS regulation of RANTES/CCL5 transcription. A series of computer models based on the RANTES/CCL5 promoter were generated to represent the organization of these functional elements. The models could identify LPS-regulated promoters in human, other vertebrate, and viral sequences in various databases."

We examined the effects of NO on the mRNA expression pattern in glomerular mesangial cells by using a low-stringency reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method and detected a cDNA fragment that was induced by interleukin 1b (IL-1b) and further up-regulated by the NO donor diethylenetriamine-nitric oxide (DETA-NO). Each respective cDNA fragment was found to match with the cDNAs of rat macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) and GRO/cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 2b (CINC-2b). Further characterization of MIP-2 regulation by Northern blot analysis confirmed an NO- and IL-1b-dependent increase in MIP-2 mRNA levels. Moreover, inhibition of IL-1b-induced endogenous NO formation by the NO-synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NMMA markedly attenuated MIP-2 protein expression. We cloned 770 bp of the 5'-flanking region of rat MIP-2 and fused this fragment to a luciferase reporter gene. Transfection of the construct into mesangial cells resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in luciferase activity in cells treated with DETA-NO when compared to controls, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism for NO-induced MIP-2 expression. Deletion and mutational analysis identified critical nuclear factor (NF)-kB and NF-IL-6 binding sites required for NO regulation of MIP-2. In vivo, inhibition of NO synthesis in the Thy-1.1 model of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis by the specific inducible-NOS inhibitor L-NIL resulted in a marked reduction of MIP-2 mRNA expression. Furthermore, infiltration of neutrophils into the glomerulus was dramatically attenuated in L-NIL-treated rats."
https://openalex.org/W2036365258,"A major obstacle to gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells, a key step for many gene therapy and tissue replacement applications, is its low efficiency. High cell mortality is responsible for the low efficiency of electrotransfection when this technique is applied to certain 'refractory' cell types such as hematopoietic stem cells. Using human primary CD-34+ cells from peripheral blood as a model, we found that transfection-induced apoptosis and, to a lesser extent, postpulse colloidal-osmotic swelling are two main factors for the poor transfection of these cells. By applying caspase inhibitors (B-D-Fluomethyl Ketone and Z-VAD-FMK) to reduce apoptosis, and by using the postpulse pelleting method to suppress colloidal-osmotic swelling, we achieved a transfection efficiency of ~20%, regardless of the presence of cytokines in the suspension medium.

https://openalex.org/W2096282794,"Under pathological conditions such as ischemia (I), subarachnoid hemorrhage, and Alzheimer's disease, astrocytes show a large increase in endothelin (ET) -like immunoreactivity. However, it is not clear whether ET is protective or destructive to these cells during brain injury. Using astrocytes from ET-1-deficient mice, we determined the effect of ET-1 on these cells under normal, hypoxic (H), and hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) conditions. Under normal culture conditions, astrocytes from wild-type and ET-1-deficient mice showed no difference in their morphology and cell proliferation rates. ET-3 and ETA receptor mRNAs were up-regulated whereas ETB receptor mRNA was down-regulated in ET-1-deficient astrocytes, suggesting that ET-1 and ET-3 may complement each other's functions and that the expressions of these endothelins and their receptors are regulated by a complex feedback mechanism. Under H and H/I conditions, ET-1 peptide and mRNA were up-regulated in wild-type astrocytes, and the astrocytes without ET-1 died faster than the wild-type astrocytes, as indicated by greater efflux of lactate dehydrogenase. The present study suggests that astrocytes without ET-1 are more vulnerable to H and H/I injuries and that the up-regulation of astrocytic ET-1 is essential for the survival of astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2083077266,"The resumption of meiosis is regulated by meiosis-preventing and meiosis-activating substances in testes and ovaries. Certain C29 precursors of cholesterol are present at elevated levels in gonadal tissue, but the mechanism by which these meiosis-activating sterols (MAS) accumulate has remained an unresolved question. Here we report that progestins alter cholesterol synthesis in HepG2 cells and rat testes to increase levels of major MAS (FF-MAS and T-MAS). These C29 sterols accumulated as a result of inhibition of Delta24-reduction and 4alpha-demethylation. Progesterone, pregnenolone, and 17alpha-OH-pregnenolone were potent inhibitors of Delta24-reduction in an in vitro cell assay and led to the accumulation of desmosterol, a Delta5,24 sterol precursor of cholesterol. A markedly different effect was observed for 17alpha-OH-progesterone, which caused the accumulation of sterols associated with inhibition of 4alpha-demethylation. The flux of 13C-acetate into lathosterol and cholesterol was decreased by progestins as measured by isotopomer spectral analysis, whereas newly synthesized MAS accumulated. The combined evidence that MAS concentrations can be regulated by physiological levels of progestins and their specific combination provides a plausible explanation for the elevated concentration of MAS in gonads and suggests a new role for progestins in fertility."

For library screening the yeast reporter strain PJ69/2A (Trp−/Leu−/His−) was sequentially transformed with the plasmid pODB8/p19ARF and a human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA-derived plasmids were recovered from yeast and reintroduced into the yeast reporter strain Y187 to confirm specificity of the interactions. To determine β-galactosidase activity in yeast, five colonies of simultaneously transformed Y187 yeast cells were grown overnight in Leu−/Trp−plates.

COS-7 cells were seeded at 50–60% confluence in 24-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of DNA containing pG5 reporter plasmid, pM/mHK33, VP16/p19ARF, and pM or VP16 control vectors as indicated in the relevant figure legends. After 3 h of transfections, cells were refed with fresh medium and then lysed in universal lysis buffer (Promega) after 48 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-LuciferaseTM reporter assay system (Promega). The results presented are the means of at least three transfections. Cell lysates (400 μg of protein) in 400 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer were incubated at 4 °C for 1–2 h with an antibody used for immunoprecipitation, as indicated in figure legends. Immunocomplexes were separated by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose, Western blotting was performed with the indicated antibodies by standard procedures, and detection was done using ECL chemiluminescence. NIH 3T3, NIH-ARF, NIH-ARF/pcDNA4-HisMAX- Pex19p (sense), and NIH-ARF/pcDNA4-HisMAX-Pex19p (antisense) derivatives (selected in 1 mg/ml zeocine, Invitrogen) were transfected with the p53-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid, PG-13luc (kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein). As a control, pRL-TK vector (Promega) was co-transfected in each assay to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. Cells were lysed and measured for luciferase activity as described above. To isolate p19ARF interacting proteins, a Gal4BD (Gal4 binding domain)-p19ARF fusion protein was used as a bait to screen a library of human cDNAs cloned into a Gal4AD (activation domain) yeast two-hybrid plasmid. One of the five clones isolated was strongly positive as determined by His prototrophy and induction of β-galactosidase expression. The nucleotide sequence of this clone revealed its identity to the 33-kDa farnesylated protein Pex19p/HK33/HsPxF/mPxF, which is essential for peroxisomal biogenesis (17Braun A. Kammerer S. Weissenhorn W. Weiss E.H. Cleve H. Gene. 1994; 146: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Kammerer S. Arnold N. Gutensohn W. Mewes H.W. Kunau W.H. Hofler G. Roscher A.A. Braun A.

The amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of p19ARF were cloned into the Gal4BD vector. Pex19p, either full-length or carboxyl- but not amino-terminal, strongly activated the β-galactosidase reporter, indicating that it is the carboxyl terminus of p19ARF that interacts with Pex1p (Fig.1 A). Pex19p and p19ARF interacted strongly in a mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig.1 B). To further detect their interaction in mammalian cells, we transfected COS-7 cells with expression plasmids encoding tagged Pex19p and p19ARF and found that the proteins coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 C). GFP1-tesmin and MPD-myc were used as respective unrelated negative controls. As seen in Fig.1 C (left panel), GFP-Pex19p coprecipitated with p19ARF-myc (immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody) but not with MPD-myc or with isotype-matched control antibody (Fig. 1 C,cf. lanes 1 and 4). GFP-tesmin (negative control) did not precipitate with p19ARF-myc. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged p19ARF from NIH-ARF cells with anti-HA tag antibody resulted in coprecipitation of a protein at ∼35-kDa, along with several others including Mdm2 (22Kurokawa K. Tanaka T. Kato J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2718-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is likely that the 35-kDa p19ARF coprecipitate is Pex19p. To determine whether Pex19p and p19ARF colocalize within intact cells, we visualized the proteins by immunostaining COS-7 (not shown) and NIH 3T3 cells transfected with tagged p19ARF and/or Pex19p. p19ARF localized mainly in the nucleolus, but there was some diffuse staining in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 A,a and b). Pex19p was seen only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 A, c). Most notably, cells expressing both p19ARF-myc and GFP-Pex19p showed p19ARF in the cytoplasm in more than 90% of cells (Fig. 2 A, d) where it colocalized with Pex19p (Fig. 2 A, d–f) suggesting that the overexpression of Pex19p causes nuclear exclusion of p19ARF (Fig.2 A). As p19ARF has been shown to bind to and inactivatemdm2 in the nucleus (11Kamijo T. Weber J.D. Zambetti G. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8292-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 16Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) resulting in activation of p53, we predicted that exclusion of p19ARF from the nucleus would lead to inactivation of p53 function via increased mdm2-mediated degradation. NIH 3T3 cells lack endogenous p19ARF because of biallelic loss of theINK4a locus. As expected, transfection of these cells with p19ARF resulted in a dose-dependent increase in p53 activity (Fig. 2 B, a). Cotransfections of Pex19p with p19ARF blocked p53 activation (Fig. 2 B, b). We ruled out the possibility that p53 might be inactivated by direct interaction with Pex19p by performing in vivocoimmunoprecipitation of Pex19p and p53 wherein no Pex19p was seen to precipitate with p53 (data not shown). We next used stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells (NIH-ARF) that express exogenous HA-tagged p19ARF under the control of the heavy metal-inducible metallothionein promoter (22Kurokawa K. Tanaka T. Kato J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2718-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The addition of 100 μm ZnSO4 to the culture medium resulted in the expression of HA-p19ARF (detectable by Western blotting) and a concurrent increase in p53-dependent luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 2 B, c). NIH-ARF cells were stably transfected with expression plasmids encoding sense (S) and antisense (AS) His-tagged Pex19p protein and were selected in medium supplemented with zeocine (1 mg/ml). These derivatives were analyzed for endogenous p53 activity when cultured in the presence of increasing amounts of ZnSO4; 100 μm induced p19ARF expression detectable by Western blotting. As predicted and consistent with the results of transient transfections (Fig. 2 B,b), Pex19p transfectants (NIH-ARF/Pex19p-S) showed down-regulation of p53 function and notably, the antisense derivative (NIH-ARF/Pex19p-AS) showed dramatic up-regulation (Fig.2 B, c). NIH 3T3 cells that lacked p19ARF did not show any effect of transfections of Pexp19-S and-AS constructs on p53-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 2 B,d). Taken together these results demonstrated that: (i) an overexpression of Pex19p blocks p19ARF enhancement of p53-mediated transcriptional activation; (ii) this occurs most likely because of nuclear exclusion of p19ARF and abrogation of its interactions with Mdm2, resulting in active degradation of p53; and (iii) such an effect of Pex19p on the transcriptional activity of p53 is mediated by p19ARF. We next analyzed the effect of Pex19p-p19ARF interactions on the expression of p21WAF1, a gene that is transactivated by p53. Induction of p19ARF led to up-regulation of p21WAF1 expression in NIH-ARF cells as has been described (22Kurokawa K. Tanaka T. Kato J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2718-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Notably, Western blot analysis of p19ARF and Pex19p with respective tag-specific antibodies revealed that the induction of p19ARF led to stabilization of Pex19p (Fig. 3 A,a). On the other hand, antisense derivatives of NIH-ARF/Pex19p had more p19ARF than sense derivatives when cultured in the presence of ZnSO4 for an equal time (Fig.3 A, a and b) suggesting that Pex19p may cause destabilization/degradation of p19ARF by a mechanism that remains to be defined. Accordingly, NIH-ARF/Pex19p antisense derivatives showed a high level of p21WAF1 expression, whereas Pex19p sense derivatives showed a lower level as compared with the control NIH-ARF cells (Fig. 3 A, a). The data suggested that antisense Pex19p decreased the level of endogenous Pex19p, resulting in activation of the p19ARF-p53-p21WAF1 pathway. This interpretation was supported by the finding that transfection of the antisense construct into NIH-ARF cells that stably express His-tagged Pex19p resulted in decreased levels of His-Pex19p protein (Fig.3 A, c). We next studied the growth of NIH-ARF cells and their Pex19p sense and antisense derivatives for Pex19p expression when cultured with and without ZnSO4. As expected, the induction of p19ARF in NIH-ARF cells led to growth retardation (Fig. 3, B and C). Increased expression of Pex19p decreased p19ARF-induced growth retardation (Fig.3, B and C), seemingly because of inactivation of the p53 function via nuclear exclusion of p19ARF by Pex19p, as demonstrated above. NIH-ARF expressing antisense Pex19p showed severe retardation of growth, exhaustion of their replicative potential, and a senescence-like morphology (Fig. 3, B and C). On the other hand, growth of NIH 3T3 cells that lack p19ARF expression was not affected by transfections of Pex19p-S and -AS, constructs demonstrating that the effect was mediated by p19ARF-Pex19p interactions (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). This data implies that p19ARF function is blocked, at least in part, by its interactions with endogenous Pex19p, and abrogation of these interactions by antisense expression of Pex19p led to activation of p19ARF-p53-p21WAF1 pathway and execution of a senescence-like growth arrest. As p19ARF and its human homologue p14ARF are important mediators of cellular senescence (5Huschtscha L.I. Reddel R.R.

Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar), in part because of transcriptional control of effectors such as p21WAF1; understanding the factors that regulate its activity is also of critical importance.

https://openalex.org/W2012307825,"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) of the high-risk type are causally involved in human tumors, in particular cervical carcinoma. Expression of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7 is maintained in HPV-positive tumors, and it was shown that E6 and E7 of HPV-16 can immortalize human keratinocytes, the natural host cells of the virus. Expression of the viral genes is also required for maintenance of the transformed phenotype. The oncogenic activity of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins is mediated by their physical and functional interaction with cellular regulatory proteins. To knock out the function of the E7 protein in living cells, we have developed peptide aptamers with high specific binding activity for the E7 protein of HPV-16. We show here that E7-binding peptide aptamers induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) in E7-expressing cells, whereas E7-negative cells are not affected. Furthermore, E7-binding peptide aptamers induce apoptosis in HPV-16-positive tumor cells derived from cervical carcinoma. The data suggest that E7-binding peptide aptamers may be useful tools to specifically eliminate HPV-positive tumors."

These animals expressed NOS-2 in liver cells under fasting conditions. Lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury in D-galactosamine-conditioned mice, which enhanced notably the effect of the endotoxin on the liver, was impaired in animals expressing NOS-2. This protection against inflammatory liver damage was dependent on NO synthesis and was caused by an inhibition of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activity and an impairment of the synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor a and interleukin 1b. These data indicate that intrahepatic synthesis of NO protects liver by inhibiting the release of cascades of proinflammatory mediators and suggest a beneficial role for local delivery of NO in the control of liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W1978915602,"Succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (SdhCDAB, complex II) from Escherichia coli is a four-subunit membrane-bound respiratory complex that catalyzes ubiquinone reduction by succinate. In the E. colienzyme, heme b 556 is ligated between SdhC His84 and SdhD His71. Contrary to a previous report (Vibat, C. R. T., Cecchini, G., Nakamura, K., Kita, K., and Gennis, R. B. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 4148–4159), we demonstrate the presence of heme in both SdhC H84L and SdhD H71Q mutants of SdhCDAB. EPR spectroscopy reveals the presence of low spin heme in the SdhC H84L (gz = 2.92) mutant and high spin heme in the SdhD H71Q mutant (g = 6.0). The presence of low spin heme in the SdhC H84L mutant suggests that the hemeb 556 is able to pick up another ligand from the protein. CO binds to the reduced form of the mutants, indicating that it is able to displace one of the ligands to the low spin heme of the SdhC H84L mutant. The g = 2.92 signal of the SdhC H84L mutant titrates with a redox potential at pH 7.0 (E m,7) of approximately +15 mV, whereas the g = 6.0 signal of the SdhD H71Q mutant titrates with anE m,7 of approximately −100 mV. The quinone site inhibitor pentachlorophenol perturbs the heme optical spectrum of the wild-type and SdhD H71Q mutant enzymes but not the SdhC H84L mutant. This finding suggests that the latter residue also plays an important role in defining the quinone binding site of the enzyme. The SdhC H84L mutation also results in a significant increase in theK m and a decrease in thek cat for ubiquinone-1, whereas the SdhD H71Q mutant has little effect on these parameters. Overall, these data indicate that SdhC His84 has an important role in defining the interaction of SdhCDAB with both quinones and hemeb 556.

The enzymes catalyze the reversible transfer of two electrons and two protons between succinate-fumarate and the quinol-quinone couples (1Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, they normally are only expressed in aerobic (SQR) or anaerobic (QFR) environments (2Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P.

Both QFR and SQR are composed of a conserved catalytic domain that consists of the two largest subunits (flavoprotein and iron-sulfur protein subunits). The flavoprotein subunit (SdhA, FrdA, or Fp) contains covalently bound FAD and the dicarboxylate binding site. The iron-sulfur protein subunit (SdhB, FrdB, or Ip) contains three distinct linearly arranged iron sulfur clusters ([2Fe-2S]2+,1+, [4Fe-4S]2+,1+, and [3Fe-4S]1+,0). The soluble dehydrogenase fragment (FpIp) binds to the hydrophobic anchor domain to form a membrane-bound complex (complex II) that is able to carry out electron transfer with quinone-quinol. The hydrophobic membrane anchor subunit pairs (SdhC, FrdC and SdhD, FrdD) are essential for forming the quinone binding sites and assembly of the whole complex (13Ackrell B.A.C. Ball M.B.

The complex II membrane anchor subunits also coordinate one or two b-type hemes; however, E. coli QFR is a type of complex II that contains no heme (4Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The single heme in E. coli SQR (17Peterson J. Vibat C.R.T. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as for the heme(s) in other complex IIs, has been shown to have bis-histidine axial ligation by EPR and near infrared magnetic circular dichroism (18Crouse B.R., Yu, C.-A., Yu, L.

Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The complex II membrane anchor domains of different species share little similarity in amino acid sequence; however, the overall structure suggests a similar arrangement of the trans-membrane helices. A structural model for the membrane anchor domain of complex II has been proposed (20Hägerhäll C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Hederstedt L. Biochem. Soc.

Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) is consistent with this model including the arrangement of the heme moieties. The redox properties of the heme b in complex II from different organisms also vary over a range of ∼200 mV. The single heme in bovine heart complex II is not readily reducible by succinate due to its low redox potential at pH 7.0 (E m,7 = −185 mV) (22Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacillus subtilis complex II contains two b hemes, with the higher potential heme b H(E m,7 = +65 mV) reducible by succinate, whereas the lower potential heme b L(E m,7 = −95 mV) is not (23Hägerhäll C. Aasa R. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7411-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Succinate is able to reduce the single heme b 556 inE. coli SQR (E m,7 = +36 mV) (24Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The varied presence and reducibility of the heme in complex IIs raises questions about whether catalysis is linked to the redox properties of cytochrome b. The heme, where present, has been shown to have an important role for proper assembly of complex II. In heme-deficient mutants of B. subtilis, the apocytochrome of SQR is made and inserted into the membrane, whereas the catalytic domain (FpIp) of the enzyme is accumulated in the cytoplasm (25Hederstedt L. Rutberg L. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 941-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results have also been reported for E. coli SQR when expressed in cells deficient in heme synthesis (26Nakamura K. Yamaki M. Sarada M. Natayama S. Vibat C.R.T. Gennis R.B. Nakayashiki T. Inokuchi H. Kojima S. Kita K. J. Biol.

SdhC His84 and SdhD His71 were identified as the heme ligands, and it was shown that succinate-quinone reductase activity was retained in the mutant enzymes despite the apparent absence of the hemeb556 (27Vibat C.R.T. Cecchini G. Nakamura K. Kita K. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4148-4159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Herein, we present spectral and kinetic characterization of the SdhC His84 and SdhD His71 mutants of E. coli SQR that retain heme. The results show that an altered heme b does assemble in the isolated mutant enzyme although with significantly lowered redox potential. The data also show that the heme moiety is near the quinone binding domain. E. colistrain DW35 (ΔfrdABCD, sdhC::kan) and itsrecA derivative GV141 have been previously described (15Westenberg D.J.

The deletion in the frd operon and the insertional mutation in the sdh operon eliminates strain background expression of any enzyme capable of succinate oxidase activity. Plasmid pSDH15 (sdhC + D + A + B +) and the plasmid derivatives encoding mutations in the heme histidyl ligands (pSdhC H84L and pSdhD H71Q) have been described previously (27Vibat C.R.T. Cecchini G. Nakamura K. Kita K. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4148-4159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pFAS and pFGS (1Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contain a frd promoter fusion to sdh(PFRD sdhC + D + A + B +) such that SQR can be expressed anaerobically in E. coli with plasmid pFAS giving the highest expression level. In order to express the mutant enzyme anaerobically, the 0.57-kilobase pairEcoRI–KpnI fragment from pSdhC H84L or the fragment from pSdhD H71Q was inserted into the equivalent site in pFAS or pFGS to create plasmids pFAS or pFGS SdhC H84L (PFRD sdhC H84L D + A + B + )and pFAS or pFGS SdhD H71Q (PFRD sdhC + D H71Q A + B +). Aerobically grown cultures were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with appropriate antibiotics, and 150 ml was used as inoculum for a 10-liter fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) containing the medium previously described (1Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) casamino acids, 0.2% (w/v) tryptone, 0.1% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 5 μm CaCl2, 20 μg/ml Fe2(SO4)3, and 50 mmsodium succinate. Ampicillin (35 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) were included in all media. Cultures were grown with high aeration and harvested at late exponential phase. Anaerobically grown cultures were grown overnight in the same medium described above (minus succinate) with 50 mm glycerol and 50 mm fumarate as electron donor and acceptor, respectively (1Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heme-deficient strain, E. coli SASX41B (HfrP02A hemA41 metB1 relA1), a δ-aminolevulenic acid (ALA) auxotroph (28Rothery R.A. Ingledew W.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was transformed with appropriate plasmids and grown in 50 ml of LB medium in the presence of ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and ALA (50 μg/ml). Cells were collected by centrifugation (10 min at 500 × g) and gently resuspended in 20 ml of LB medium without ALA, and 1 ml was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium. Cultures were then grown aerobically in LB with ampicillin (35 μg/ml) or anaerobically in the same medium with 50 mm glucose. When necessary, the medium was supplemented with 100 μm ALA. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the membrane fraction enriched in SQR was isolated as previously described (1Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that the cells were disrupted by one passage with an EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer (Avestin, Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) at 18,000 p.s.i. at 4 °C. Membranes containing wild type or mutant SQR were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 7.2) to ∼30 mg of protein/ml and frozen at −70 °C. To purify wild type and mutant SQR, the membranes were extracted with 2% (w/v) of the nonionic detergent Thesit (polyoxyethylene 9-dodecyl ether) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as previously described (1Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The solubilized extract was then applied to a HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted using a 600-ml linear gradient of 0.1–0.25 mNaCl in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) with 0.05% Thesit according to published procedures (24Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vibat C.R.T. Cecchini G. Nakamura K. Kita K. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4148-4159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The brownish fractions containing succinate dehydrogenase activity were pooled and concentrated with Centriprep-30 concentrators (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). The enzyme was washed with 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), and reconcentrated to 15–20 mg of protein/ml and stored at −70 °C. Activity measurements for the succinate oxidase reaction were measured in the presence of 10 mm succinate in the assay cuvette as previously described (29Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The succinate-phenazine ethosulfate (PES) reaction in the presence of dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) (ε600 = 21.8 mm−1cm−1, pH 7.8) was measured with 1.5 mm PES and 50 μm DCIP. To measure kinetic parameters of succinate-quinone reductase activity of wild type and mutant SQR, 30 μm Wurster's Blue (ε612 = 12 mm−1cm−1) was used as final electron acceptor with varied amounts of quinone as previously described (29Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Grivennikova V.G. Gavrikova E.V. Timoshin A.A. Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a Hewlett Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA) in a 2-ml anaerobic cuvette. The spectrum and concentration of cytochrome b 556attributed to purified and membrane-bound SQR enzymes was determined as previously described (1Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol.

Spectra were routinely recorded of membranes suspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.2 mm EDTA at a protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. Anaerobiosis was achieved by vacuum evaporation and saturation of the buffer with oxygen-free argon. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP300 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 flowing helium cryostat. Samples were prepared as described in Fig. 4. Potentiometric titrations were carried out as previously described with 150-μl samples being extracted from the tritrations into 3-mm internal diameter quartz EPR tubes (31Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Rothery R.A. Blasco F. Magalon A. Asso M. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12747-12757Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Titrations were carried out on membranes enriched in wild-type and mutant enzymes at a protein concentration of ∼30 mg/ml in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). EPR spectra were recorded as described in Fig. 6 legend.Figure 6Potentiometric titrations of high and low spin signals attributable to wild-type and mutant enzyme.

Data were obtained from EPR spectra recorded as described in the legend to Fig. 4, except that the microwave power used was 2 milliwatts, and three scans were accumulated for titration of the g = 2.92 signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Protein content in membranes was determined by the Biuret method and in isolated enzymes by the method of Lowry in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The protoheme IX content of cytochrome b was determined from the pyridine hemochromogen difference spectra (dithionite-reduced minus oxidized) (ε558–540 = 23.98 mm−1cm−1) as described (33Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The histidyl-flavin concentration in purified SQR enzymes was determined as follows. Purified protein (0.5–0.7 mg) was precipitated with 1 ml of cold acetic acetone (8 μl of 6 m HCl per 1 ml of acetone) to remove protoheme IX and the iron-sulfur clusters and then centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge. The yellowish pellet was washed three more times with the same volume of acidic acetone and suspended in 0.8 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) with 1% (w/v) SDS, and the precipitated protein was solubilized after 2 h at 38 °C. The spectrum of the resulting solution shows two peaks at 354 and 445 nm attributed to histidyl-riboflavin. The covalent flavin concentration was determined using ε445 = 12.0 mm−1 cm−1for histidyl-riboflavin (34McIntire W. Edmondson D.E. Hopper D.J. Singer T.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3068-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that aerobic overexpression of SQR can be achieved in E. coli from plasmids that encode wild type SQR (24Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has been shown that anaerobic expression of SQR driven from thefrd promoter (PFRD) enables even higher levels of SQR to be produced in the membranes of E. coli (1Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to facilitate expression of site-directed mutant forms of SQR and to aid in purification of the enzymes, constructs were cloned into plasmid pFGS so expression could be driven by the PFRDpromoter. E. coli strain DW35, when transformed with pFGS, is capable of growth under anoxic conditions on glycerol-fumarate minimal medium, indicating that wild type SQR can replace fumarate reductase in the anaerobic respiratory chain (1Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that E. coli GV141 expressing SdhC H84L or SdhD H71Q mutant enzyme is able to grow aerobically on succinate minimal medium, indicating a functional complex II is formed (27Vibat C.R.T. Cecchini G. Nakamura K. Kita K. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4148-4159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether anaerobic growth is possible with these mutant SQR enzymes, DW35 containing either pFGS SdhC H84L or pFGS SdhD H71Q was grown anaerobically on glycerol-fumarate minimal medium as previously described (1Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both mutants supported anaerobic growth on glycerol-fumarate minimal medium in E. coli DW35 with a doubling time of 3.8 h for pFGS SdhC H84L and 3.2 h for pFGS SdhD H71Q as compared with 3.0 h for wild-type SQR (data not shown). These results indicate that a functional complex competent in catalysis for the menaquinol-fumarate reductase reaction in vivo is expressed from both the wild-type and mutant plasmids. Previous studies with aerobically grown E. coli cells encoding the SdhC H84L and SdhD H71Q SQR mutants suggested that these substitutions resulted in formation of catalytically active membrane-associated complexes that lacked heme (27Vibat C.R.T. Cecchini G. Nakamura K. Kita K. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4148-4159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was surprising that membranes isolated from anaerobically grown DW35 cells transformed with both mutants plasmids had an intense color. Membranes from SdhC H84L were brownish red in color, similar to those from cells transformed with wild type SQR plasmids. The membrane fraction from the SdhD H71Q mutant was brownish green in color. The absorption spectra of membranes from strain DW35 enriched in wild-type or mutant SQR complex show a significant absorbance at the Soret region compared with membranes obtained from an E. coli control strain (MC4100) transformed with pBR322. MC4100, the parent strain of DW35 (15Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contains chromosomal copies of the sdh and frd operons and under the anaerobic conditions used for growth does not express SQR. Under the anoxic conditions used for growth, the heme containingbd-oxidase is expressed (35Cotter P.A. Chepuri V. Gennis R.B. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6333-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and contributes somewhat to the absorbance at the Soret region in the membrane fraction. Fig.1 shows the dithionite-reduced minus air-oxidized difference spectra of membranes enriched in wild-type and mutant SQR complexes as well as membranes from anaerobically grown cells of E. coli MC4100. The spectra show a significant α-absorption at 558 nm and a broader β-absorption between 526 and 528 nm as well as the Soret absorption (∼425 nm) characteristic of room temperature difference spectra for cytochromeb 556 from SQR (36Yang X., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9683-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Analysis of protoheme IX content of the membranes by the pyridine hemochromogen method showed similar cytochrome b concentrations for wild-type SQR and both mutant SQRs (Table I). Mutant forms, however, show lower amplitudes at the Soret absorption and also changes in the line shape of the spectrum (Fig. 1). Both mutants demonstrate succinate-PES reductase and succinate-Q1 reductase activity; however, SdhC H84L showed at least two times lower succinate-PES reductase activity than the wild-type or SdhD H71Q mutant membranes. Moreover, the succinate-quinone reductase activity was even lower in the SdhC mutant, and the ratio of Q1/PES activities indicated that this mutant is significantly impaired in its ability to interact with quinones.Table ICytochrome b content and analysis of activity in membranes from anaerobically grown E. coliMembrane sampleCytochrome bcontentsSuccinate:PES reductaseSuccinate:Q1reductaseRatio Q1/PES activitynmol/mg proteinμmol/min per mgμmol/min per mgGV141/pFGS3.422.119.60.88GV141/pFGS SdhC H84L2.69.53.80.4GV141/pFGS SdhD H71Q3.317.313.10.76MC4100/pBR322 1-aParent strain, containing only a chromosomal copy of sdhCDAB.0.6ND 1-bND, not determined.ND1-a Parent strain, containing only a chromosomal copy of sdhCDAB.1-b ND, not determined.

In the present studies, however (using slight modifications of the original protocol; see “Materials and Methods”), the chromatographic profiles for both SQR mutants and the wild-type enzyme were identical. A single brownish peak with succinate dehydrogenase activity appears at the end of the 0.1–0.25 m NaCl gradient (data not shown). On the basis of SDS-PAGE analysis, the purity of the wild-type and mutant SQRs also appear identical (data not shown). TableII indicates the protoheme IX content of the isolated SQR enzymes. Comparing the ratio of covalent FAD to protoheme IX content of the purified enzymes, it appears that the SQR mutants show a 10–15% deficiency in protoheme IX compared with the ratio of wild-type enzyme.Table IICofactor content and kinetic parameters of purified wild-type and mutant SQR of E. coli (pH 7.8, 30 °C)Purified enzymesProtoheme IXFAD/protoheme IX ratioSuccinate-PES turnover 2-aBased on cytochrome b content.Succinate-Q1turnover2-aBased on cytochrome b content.Q1/PES activity ratioKmQ1 2-bDetermined with Wurster's Blue as final electron acceptor.KiPCP 2-bDetermined with Wurster's Blue as final electron acceptor.nmol/mgs−1s−1μmμmWild type5.91 /1.0382780.952.517SdhC H84L5.41 /0.8344180.384083SdhD H71Q5.21 /0.8767540.85202-a Based on cytochrome b content.2-b Determined with Wurster's Blue as final electron acceptor.

The oxidized cytochrome in wild-type SQR shows a broad absorption at the α- and β-regions with the Soret absorption at 412 nm. Incubation of wild-type enzyme with sodium dithionite reduces the cytochrome completely within half a minute, and an α absorption at 558 nm and a broad β absorption at 528 nm appear along with a sharp symmetrical Soret absorption at 424 nm. The air-oxidized spectrum for the SdhC H84L mutant SQR shows a broad absorption at 540 and 580 nm unlike wild-type SQR; however, the Soret absorption shows a maximum at 411 nm with similar intensity to the wild-type cytochrome b 556.

https://openalex.org/W2168333087,"CD38, a nonlineage-restricted surface glycoprotein, is an ecto-enzyme (ADP ribosyl cyclase/cADPR hydrolase/EC 3.2.2.6) that regulates cytoplasmic Ca2+ and cell-cell interactions. The molecule also delivers trans-membrane signals, despite a structural ineptitude to the scope. To reconcile these issues in a unitarian model, we compared the effects of CD38 signaling in circulating and residential T lymphocytes, the latter represented by those colonizing the intestinal lamina propria. Results are as follows: 1) LP T cells express an enzymatically active form of CD38, characterized by a modified ratio between cyclase and hydrolase functions; 2) LP T cells do not mobilize Ca2+ upon CD38 ligation, as seen in PB T cells (this condition is due to a lack in activation of PLC- g, constantly observed in PB T lymphocytes); 3) The early steps of CD38 signaling involve activation of lck, syk, and LAT; 4) Late events include synthesis and release of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-g and GM-CSF; 5) The uniqueness of the CD38 pathway in LP T cells is not caused by impaired interactions with the CD31 ligand. The differences observed concern the signaling machinery that CD38 exploits for its own use and not the interplay with its ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2083149335,"The molecular basis of sickle cell disease (SCD) is well known but the pathophysiology is poorly understood. It remains intractable to therapy. Hyperactivity of several membrane transport systems, including the K+-Cl- cotransporter (termed KCC), cause HbS-containing red cells (termed HbS cells) to dehydrate and sickle, leading to the development of sickle cell crises (SCCs). Contrary to normal red cells (HbA cells), KCC in HbS cells is active at low O2 tensions (PO2s), remaining responsive to low pH or urea. Since these stimuli are usually encountered in hypoxic regions, the abnormal O2 dependence increases the contribution of KCC to dehydration, and hence development of SCCs. These differences with HbA cells may be due to the younger population of cells or to polymerization of HbS. We used 86Rb+ as a K+ congener to investigate the activity of KCC at different PO2s, and density gradient separation to investigate different red cell fractions. We found no correlation of O2 dependence with cell fractions. We also used the substituted benzaldehyde 12C79 to increase the O2 affinity of HbS and found that its effect on HbS O2 saturation and cell sickling correlated with that on both Cl--independent and Cl--dependent K+ transport, implying that, at low PO2s, KCC activity correlated with HbS polymerization. The importance of these results to understanding the pathophysiology of SCD, and for the design of chemotherapeutic agents to ameliorate or prevent SCC, is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1980313477,"Sphingomyelinase (SMase) stimulation and subsequent ceramide generation are suggested to be involved in signal transduction of stress-induced apoptosis. We now show that apoptosis of human macrophages (MΦ) and fibroblasts initiated by oxidized low density lipoproteins (minimally modified LDL, mmLDL) is associated with an increase in acid SMase (aSMase, E.C. 3.1.4.12) expression and ceramide concentration. Application of a novel, potent, and specific inhibitor of aSMase expression (NB6) diminished the effects of mmLDL and C6-ceramide treatment by inhibiting transcription via Sp1 and AP-2. Moreover, apoptosis was abolished after mmLDL and C6-ceramide treatment of hereditary aSMase-deficient fibroblasts (from Niemann-Pick patients). We suggest that in mmLDL-initiated apoptosis 1) enhanced ceramide generation via aSMase appears to be required as well as 2) a positive feedback control of aSMase expression by the increase in intracellular ceramide concentration.—Deigner, H.-P., Claus, R., Bonaterra, G.

https://openalex.org/W2081735027,"The majority of elderly men are affected by benign and malign diseases of the prostate that are governed by endocrine factors and local stromal/epithelial and luminal/epithelial interactions. Prostate epithelial cells secrete numerous factors into the seminal plasma (SMP) that are thought to be responsible for nutrition, accurate pH, and ionic environment of sperm. Our hypothesis assumes that prostatic factors responsible for optimal fertility might have retrograde influences on epithelial cell growth, differentiation, and function. SMP was analyzed for proteins and other biologically active substances by size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. Each fraction was investigated for its effect on cell growth and death. A low molecular mass fraction (2-4 kDa) was responsible for inducing apoptosis in proliferating prostate epithelial cells. Signal transduction was mediated by the production of cAMP; no significant changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane receptors were observed. Mechanisms of apoptosis, i.e., caspase- and mitochondria-dependent pathways, were investigated in prostate epithelial cells by caspase activity assays, annexin/propidium iodide staining, changes in mitochondrial potential, p53, Par-4, Bax, and Bcl-2 protein levels. SMP induced p53- and Bcl-2-dependent apoptosis without activation of caspase-3. Obviously, SMP contains protective factors that help eliminate degenerated cells and control epithelial renewal. Age-related changes in the composition of SMP or the susceptibility of epithelial cells might, therefore, contribute to proliferative prostatic diseases"
https://openalex.org/W2018489511,"In previous studies, added parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) inhibits whereas transfected PTHrP stimulates the proliferation of A10 aortic smooth muscle cells by nuclear translocation of the peptide. In the present studies, we asked whether these paradoxical trophic actions of PTHrP occur in smooth muscle cells (SMC) cultured from small intrarenal arteries of, and whether they are altered in, 12-wk-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as compared to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. SHR cells grew faster than WKY cells. PTHrP transcript was increased in SHR-derived cells whereas PTH1 receptor (PTH1R) transcripts were similar in both cell lines. In both strains of cells, stable transfection with human PTHrP(1-139) cDNA did not further induce proliferation, suggesting maximal effect of endogenous PTHrP in wild cells. In contrast, transfection with antisense hPTHrP(1-139) cDNA, which abolished PTHrP mRNA, decreased WKY but increased SHR cell proliferation. Added PTHrP(1-36) (1-100 pM) decreased WKY and increased SHR cell proliferation. Additional studies indicated that the preferential coupling of PTH1-R to G-protein Gi was responsible for the proliferative effect of exogenous PTHrP in SHR cells. Moreover, PTHrP was detected in the nucleolus of a fraction of WKY and SHR renal SMC, in vitro as well as in situ, suggesting that the nucleolar translocation of PTHrP might be involved in the proliferative effects of endogenous PTHrP. In renovascular SMC, added PTHrP is antimitogenic, whereas endogenously produced PTHrP is mitogenic. These paradoxical effects of PTHrP on renovascular SMC proliferation appear to be reversed in the SHR model of genetic hypertension. A new concept emerges from these results, according to which a single molecule may have opposite effects on VSMC proliferation under physiological and pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2109322655,"Portal hypertensive (PHT) gastric mucosa has increased susceptibility to injury and impaired mucosal healing. Because our previous study showed that ulcer-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (ERK) plays a pivotal role in gastric mucosal healing, we investigated whether ERK activation is altered in PHT gastric mucosa following alcohol injury. We studied ERK2 phosphorylation and activity and expression of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in gastric mucosa of PHT and sham-operated (SO) normal rats both at baseline and following alcohol injury. In SO gastric mucosa, ERK2 phosphorylation and activity were significantly increased time-dependently following alcohol injury: by 221% and 137%, respectively at 24 h vs. baseline. In contrast, in PHT gastric mucosa following alcohol injury, neither ERK2 phosphorylation nor activity was increased versus baseline. In PHT gastric mucosa, MKP-1 mRNA and protein expression were increased at baseline versus SO rats and were increased further following alcohol injury with values higher by 20%-40% at each study time versus SO rats. Because ERK2 is crucial for mucosal healing, reduced ERK2 activation resulting from the overexpression of MKP-1 might be the basis for the impaired mucosal healing in PHT gastric mucosa."
