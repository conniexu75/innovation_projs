Toward an understanding of Rab27a function, we searched for proteins that interact with Rab27a(GTP) using the yeast two-hybrid system and identified JFC1/Slp1, a protein of unknown function. JFC1/Slp1 and related proteins, including melanophilin, contain a conserved amino-terminal domain similar to the Rab3a-binding domain of Rabphilin-3. We used several methods to demonstrate that this conserved amino-terminal domain is a Rab27-binding domain. We show that this domain interacts directly, and in a GTP-dependent manner with Rab27a. Furthermore, overexpression of this domain in melanocytes results in perinuclear clustering of melanosomes, suggesting that this region is sufficient for interaction with, and perturbation of function of, Rab27a in a physiological context. Thus, we identified a novel family of Rab27-binding proteins. We also show that melanophilin associates with Rab27a and myosin Va on melanosomes in melanocytes, and present evidence that a domain within the carboxyl-terminal region of melanophilin interacts with the carboxyl-terminal tail of the melanocyte-specific splice isoform of myosin Va. Thus, melanophilin can associate simultaneously with activated Rab27a and myosin Va via distinct regions, and serve as a linker between these proteins.

Precisely how Rabs regulate membrane transport remains unclear, however, a common mechanism appears to be the ability to regulate the membrane recruitment of a diverse group of “effector” molecules when activated by conformational changes created by GTP-binding.Loss of function mutations in one of these Rab proteins, Rab27a, leads to Griscelli syndrome, a combination of partial albinism and severe immunodeficiency with hemophagocytic syndrome (3Seabra M.C.

The clinical picture appears to be a manifestation of defects in two specialized lysosome-related organelles, the melanosome in melanocytes and lytic granules in cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL).1Melanosomes are normally evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and peripheral dendrites in skin melanocytes. Current models suggest that this steady-state distribution is achieved through coupling of microtubule-driven transport to the periphery from the perinuclear site of synthesis, followed by actin-mediated retention of melanosomes at the periphery (5Marks M.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In contrast, melanosomes within melanocytes isolated from Griscelli syndrome patients, and from the respective mouse model ashen (Rab27a ash ), display a striking redistribution pattern with the majority of them present in the perinuclear area (7Bahadoran P.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two other mouse mutants display similar coat color dilution and cellular phenotype. One is thedilute (Myo5ad ) mouse caused by mutations in the unconventional myosin, myosin Va, and the other isleaden (Mlphln ), whose gene has been identified recently by Jenkins and co-workers (11Mercer J.A. Seperack P.K. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 12Matesic L.E. Yip R. Reuss A.E. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Fletcher C.F.

The similarities between all three phenotypes suggested that the three proteins are active in a common pathway in melanosome transport, most likely in tethering melanosomes to the peripheral actin meshwork. Several recent observations are consistent with this hypothesis. First, all three mutants are suppressed by the dilute suppressor mutation (13Moore K.J. Swing D.A. Rinchik E.M. Mucenski M.L. Buchberg A.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genetics. 1988; 119: 933-941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, myosin Va is co-immunoprecipitated with Rab27a in melanocyte extracts (9Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Rapak A. Gomes A.Q. Hopkins C.R. Seabra M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Third, association of myosin Va with melanosomes is greatly reduced in cultured melanocytes in the absence of either Rab27a (ashen) or Mlph (leaden) (9Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Rapak A. Gomes A.Q. Hopkins C.R. Seabra M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Wu X. Rao K. Bowers M.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer III, J.A. J.

In contrast, Rab27a is correctly localized to melanosomes in cultured melanocytes in the absence of either Mlph (leaden) or myosin Va (dilute) (9Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Rapak A. Gomes A.Q. Hopkins C.R. Seabra M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 14Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Hopkins C.R. Strom M. Barral D.C. Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Seabra M.C.

Together, these observations indicate that targeting of Rab27a is independent of myosin Va and Mlph, and that Rab27a may act together with or via Mlph to allow the recruitment of myosin Va to melanosomes, thereby allowing their retention in the peripheral actin cytoskeleton. Further support for this order of events comes from the finding that Mlph contains an amino terminus 150-amino acid domain which is similar to the Rab-binding domain of the Rab3a effector Rabphilin-3 (12Matesic L.E. Yip R. Reuss A.E. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Fletcher C.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10238-10243Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 16Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting it may directly interact with Rab27a.In CTLs, the Rab27a mutation leads to a late block in secretion of lytic granules into the immunological synapse that forms between an activated T-cell and its target cell (17Stinchcombe J.C. Barral D.C. Mules E.H. Booth S. Hume A.N. Machesky L.M. Seabra M.C. Griffiths G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18Haddad E.K., Wu, X. Hammer J.A., II Henkart P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although the loss of CTL activity is apparently not deleterious in laboratory mice, it may underlie the lethal hemophagocytic syndrome in Griscelli syndrome patients (4Ménasché G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A., Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dilute and leadenmice do not exhibit CTL defects, suggesting that the Rab27a function is mediated by different sets of effectors in melanocytes and CTLs (14Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Hopkins C.R. Strom M. Barral D.C. Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Seabra M.C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,18Haddad E.K., Wu, X. Hammer J.A., II Henkart P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that Mlph and myosin Va are not detectably expressed in CTLs (14Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Hopkins C.R. Strom M. Barral D.C. Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Seabra M.C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).In this paper, we present evidence that Mlph and related proteins constitute a family of Rab27-binding proteins. Furthermore, we show that Mlph is a Rab27 effector protein as it is able to bridge activated Rab27a and myosin Va by binding to both molecules via distinct regions at the amino terminus and central region of the molecule, respectively.DISCUSSIONWe report here the identification of a novel family of proteins that act as Rab27-binding proteins. This family of proteins includes Mlph involved in melanosome transport, Gnph involved in insulin secretion from pancreatic β−cells, and a variety of other proteins of unknown function (JFC1/Slp1, Slp2-a, Slp3-a, and Slac2-b). This finding supports our recent suggestion that Rab27a acts through different sets of effectors in different cell types (14Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Hopkins C.R. Strom M. Barral D.C. Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Seabra M.C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).We screened keratinocyte and leukocyte libraries using the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate Rab27a-interacting proteins and identified one protein, JFC1/Slp1. This protein was recently isolated by Babior and co-workers (31McAdara Berkowitz J.K. Catz S.D. Johnson J.L. Ruedi J.M. Thon V. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18855-18862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) who identified the human version in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a p67 phox -interacting protein, showed that it binds phosphatidylinositides, and named it JFC1. Also, Mikoshiba and co-workers (32Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) independently cloned the mouse version as one of three novel proteins containing tandem C2 domains related to synaptotagmin, and called it synaptotagmin-like protein-1 (Slp1). The results of the former study suggested that JFC1/Slp1 is involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase in neutrophils, and the present study raises the interesting possibility that Rab27a is involved in the same process.We demonstrate here that full-length JFC1/Slp1 and Mlph interact with Rab27a, and furthermore, that the amino-terminal conserved domain in JFC1/Slp1, Mlph, and other Slps is a Rab27-interacting domain. We reached this conclusion using a variety of methods, including anin vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins, a yeast two-hybrid assay, a melanocyte-based assay scoring for dominant-negative effects, and a precipitation assay following transient transfection. In a very recent study, Mikoshiba and co-workers (38Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) performed a thorough analysis of the Rab binding specificity of six members of the JFC1/Slp1 family in vitroand reported a similar conclusion. Independently, Izumi and co-workers (39Yi Z. Yokota H. Torii S. Aoki T. Hosaka M. Zhao S. Takata K. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) recently identified Rab27a as a binding protein for Gnph, a member of this family that is expressed primarily in endocrine tissues, such as pancreatic β-cells and the pituitary. Rab27a and Gnph co-localized to the limiting membrane of insulin-containing dense granules in pancreatic β-cells, and overexpression of wild-type Rab27a and Rab27aQ78L mutant significantly enhanced high K+-induced insulin secretion, suggesting their involvement in regulated insulin exocytosis. Our results confirm these recent results given the different experimental approaches used, and extend them by demonstrating through the use of purified recombinant proteins that the interaction between Rab27a and this family of proteins is direct and GTP-dependent.In melanocytes, it is now well established that Rab27a regulates melanosome motility in concert with Mlph and myosin Va (see Introduction). Mutations in all three genes in mice result in similar perinuclear clustering of melanosomes in melanocytes, and consequently a coat color dilution because of deficient melanocyte/keratinocyte melanosome transfer. Previous studies have suggested an order of events where Rab27a and Mlph recruit myosin Va to melanosomes and tether them to actin filaments (14Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Hopkins C.R. Strom M. Barral D.C. Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Seabra M.C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Provance D.W. James T.L. Mercer J.A. Traffic. 2002; 3: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this study, we confirm and extend these previous findings by demonstrating that all three proteins co-localize to melanosomes, and that one role of Mlph is to act as a linker to bridge the interaction between activated Rab27a and myosin Va. The present results show that: (i) Rab27a and myosin Va interact indirectly via Mlph; (ii) Rab27a binds to Mlph via a conserved amino-terminal domain, which corresponds to the SHD domain identified by Mikoshiba and co-workers (16Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); (iii) a central region of Mlph distinct from the Rab27a-binding site interacts with the carboxyl terminus tail of myosin Va. Our results indicate that amino acids 367–400 represent a minimal myosin Va-binding region. We note that the interaction of this minimal region was weaker than that seen with larger fragments (Fig. 4), so it is likely that neighboring regions may contribute to binding affinity/stability or conformation of this region. Whereas this work was under review, Hammer and colleagues (40Wu X.S. Rao K. Zhang H. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Matesic L.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer III, J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and Mikoshiba and colleagues (41Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12432-12436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) reported similar conclusions in complementary studies, namely that Mlph is a melanosome-associated protein involved in targeting of myosin Va to melanosomes, and that Mlph interacts with Rab27a and myosin Va via distinct regions at the amino and carboxyl terminus, respectively. Our data are consistent with these reports and further refine the interaction site of melanophilin with myosin Va.We hypothesized recently that Rab27a is likely to act through effector cascades other than Mlph-myosin Va in non-melanocytic cells, given that Rab27a, but not Mlph or myosin Va mutations lead to immunodeficiency because of loss of CTL lytic granule exocytosis (14Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Hopkins C.R. Strom M. Barral D.C. Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Seabra M.C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,18Haddad E.K., Wu, X. Hammer J.A., II Henkart P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The present results support this idea, and raise the possibility that one or more members of the Mlph family are acting in concert with Rab27a to regulate lytic granule exocytosis in CTLs. Another possibility is that Rab27a is acting sequentially with several effector proteins. Rab5, for example, interacts with a variety of effectors that are structurally and functionally unrelated to orchestrate a series of events that regulate early endosome dynamics (1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar). Future experiments should elucidate the mechanism of action of Rab27a in the different cell types. A large family of Ras-like GTPases, termed Rab in mammals and Ypt/Sec4 in yeast, are important regulators of organelle identity and vesicular transport (1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar, 2Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 3Seabra M.C. Mules E.H. Hume A.N. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 23-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Precisely how Rabs regulate membrane transport remains unclear, however, a common mechanism appears to be the ability to regulate the membrane recruitment of a diverse group of “effector” molecules when activated by conformational changes created by GTP-binding. Loss of function mutations in one of these Rab proteins, Rab27a, leads to Griscelli syndrome, a combination of partial albinism and severe immunodeficiency with hemophagocytic syndrome (3Seabra M.C. Mules E.H. Hume A.N. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 23-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 4Ménasché G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S.

The clinical picture appears to be a manifestation of defects in two specialized lysosome-related organelles, the melanosome in melanocytes and lytic granules in cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL).1 Melanosomes are normally evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and peripheral dendrites in skin melanocytes.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In contrast, melanosomes within melanocytes isolated from Griscelli syndrome patients, and from the respective mouse model ashen (Rab27a ash ), display a striking redistribution pattern with the majority of them present in the perinuclear area (7Bahadoran P. Aberdam E. Mantoux F. Busca R. Bille K. Yalman N. de Saint Basile G. Casaroli-Marano R. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J.

One is thedilute (Myo5ad ) mouse caused by mutations in the unconventional myosin, myosin Va, and the other isleaden (Mlphln ), whose gene has been identified recently by Jenkins and co-workers (11Mercer J.A.

The similarities between all three phenotypes suggested that the three proteins are active in a common pathway in melanosome transport, most likely in tethering melanosomes to the peripheral actin meshwork. Several recent observations are consistent with this hypothesis. First, all three mutants are suppressed by the dilute suppressor mutation (13Moore K.J. Swing D.A. Rinchik E.M. Mucenski M.L. Buchberg A.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genetics. 1988; 119: 933-941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, myosin Va is co-immunoprecipitated with Rab27a in melanocyte extracts (9Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Rapak A. Gomes A.Q. Hopkins C.R. Seabra M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Third, association of myosin Va with melanosomes is greatly reduced in cultured melanocytes in the absence of either Rab27a (ashen) or Mlph (leaden) (9Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Rapak A. Gomes A.Q.

In contrast, Rab27a is correctly localized to melanosomes in cultured melanocytes in the absence of either Mlph (leaden) or myosin Va (dilute) (9Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Rapak A. Gomes A.Q.

Together, these observations indicate that targeting of Rab27a is independent of myosin Va and Mlph, and that Rab27a may act together with or via Mlph to allow the recruitment of myosin Va to melanosomes, thereby allowing their retention in the peripheral actin cytoskeleton. Further support for this order of events comes from the finding that Mlph contains an amino terminus 150-amino acid domain which is similar to the Rab-binding domain of the Rab3a effector Rabphilin-3 (12Matesic L.E.

Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting it may directly interact with Rab27a. In CTLs, the Rab27a mutation leads to a late block in secretion of lytic granules into the immunological synapse that forms between an activated T-cell and its target cell (17Stinchcombe J.C. Barral D.C. Mules E.H. Booth S. Hume A.N. Machesky L.M. Seabra M.C. Griffiths G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 18Haddad E.K., Wu, X. Hammer J.A., II Henkart P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although the loss of CTL activity is apparently not deleterious in laboratory mice, it may underlie the lethal hemophagocytic syndrome in Griscelli syndrome patients (4Ménasché G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A., Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dilute and leadenmice do not exhibit CTL defects, suggesting that the Rab27a function is mediated by different sets of effectors in melanocytes and CTLs (14Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Hopkins C.R. Strom M. Barral D.C. Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Seabra M.C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,18Haddad E.K., Wu, X. Hammer J.A., II Henkart P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that Mlph and myosin Va are not detectably expressed in CTLs (14Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Hopkins C.R. Strom M. Barral D.C. Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Seabra M.C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present evidence that Mlph and related proteins constitute a family of Rab27-binding proteins. Furthermore, we show that Mlph is a Rab27 effector protein as it is able to bridge activated Rab27a and myosin Va by binding to both molecules via distinct regions at the amino terminus and central region of the molecule, respectively. DISCUSSIONWe report here the identification of a novel family of proteins that act as Rab27-binding proteins. This family of proteins includes Mlph involved in melanosome transport, Gnph involved in insulin secretion from pancreatic β−cells, and a variety of other proteins of unknown function (JFC1/Slp1, Slp2-a, Slp3-a, and Slac2-b). This finding supports our recent suggestion that Rab27a acts through different sets of effectors in different cell types (14Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Hopkins C.R. Strom M. Barral D.C. Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Seabra M.C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).We screened keratinocyte and leukocyte libraries using the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate Rab27a-interacting proteins and identified one protein, JFC1/Slp1. This protein was recently isolated by Babior and co-workers (31McAdara Berkowitz J.K. Catz S.D. Johnson J.L. Ruedi J.M. Thon V. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18855-18862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) who identified the human version in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a p67 phox -interacting protein, showed that it binds phosphatidylinositides, and named it JFC1. Also, Mikoshiba and co-workers (32Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) independently cloned the mouse version as one of three novel proteins containing tandem C2 domains related to synaptotagmin, and called it synaptotagmin-like protein-1 (Slp1). The results of the former study suggested that JFC1/Slp1 is involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase in neutrophils, and the present study raises the interesting possibility that Rab27a is involved in the same process.We demonstrate here that full-length JFC1/Slp1 and Mlph interact with Rab27a, and furthermore, that the amino-terminal conserved domain in JFC1/Slp1, Mlph, and other Slps is a Rab27-interacting domain. We reached this conclusion using a variety of methods, including anin vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins, a yeast two-hybrid assay, a melanocyte-based assay scoring for dominant-negative effects, and a precipitation assay following transient transfection. In a very recent study, Mikoshiba and co-workers (38Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) performed a thorough analysis of the Rab binding specificity of six members of the JFC1/Slp1 family in vitroand reported a similar conclusion. Independently, Izumi and co-workers (39Yi Z. Yokota H. Torii S. Aoki T. Hosaka M. Zhao S. Takata K. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) recently identified Rab27a as a binding protein for Gnph, a member of this family that is expressed primarily in endocrine tissues, such as pancreatic β-cells and the pituitary. Rab27a and Gnph co-localized to the limiting membrane of insulin-containing dense granules in pancreatic β-cells, and overexpression of wild-type Rab27a and Rab27aQ78L mutant significantly enhanced high K+-induced insulin secretion, suggesting their involvement in regulated insulin exocytosis. Our results confirm these recent results given the different experimental approaches used, and extend them by demonstrating through the use of purified recombinant proteins that the interaction between Rab27a and this family of proteins is direct and GTP-dependent.In melanocytes, it is now well established that Rab27a regulates melanosome motility in concert with Mlph and myosin Va (see Introduction). Mutations in all three genes in mice result in similar perinuclear clustering of melanosomes in melanocytes, and consequently a coat color dilution because of deficient melanocyte/keratinocyte melanosome transfer. Previous studies have suggested an order of events where Rab27a and Mlph recruit myosin Va to melanosomes and tether them to actin filaments (14Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Hopkins C.R. Strom M. Barral D.C. Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Seabra M.C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Provance D.W. James T.L. Mercer J.A. Traffic. 2002; 3: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this study, we confirm and extend these previous findings by demonstrating that all three proteins co-localize to melanosomes, and that one role of Mlph is to act as a linker to bridge the interaction between activated Rab27a and myosin Va. The present results show that: (i) Rab27a and myosin Va interact indirectly via Mlph; (ii) Rab27a binds to Mlph via a conserved amino-terminal domain, which corresponds to the SHD domain identified by Mikoshiba and co-workers (16Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); (iii) a central region of Mlph distinct from the Rab27a-binding site interacts with the carboxyl terminus tail of myosin Va. Our results indicate that amino acids 367–400 represent a minimal myosin Va-binding region. We note that the interaction of this minimal region was weaker than that seen with larger fragments (Fig. 4), so it is likely that neighboring regions may contribute to binding affinity/stability or conformation of this region. Whereas this work was under review, Hammer and colleagues (40Wu X.S. Rao K. Zhang H. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Matesic L.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer III, J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and Mikoshiba and colleagues (41Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12432-12436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) reported similar conclusions in complementary studies, namely that Mlph is a melanosome-associated protein involved in targeting of myosin Va to melanosomes, and that Mlph interacts with Rab27a and myosin Va via distinct regions at the amino and carboxyl terminus, respectively. Our data are consistent with these reports and further refine the interaction site of melanophilin with myosin Va.We hypothesized recently that Rab27a is likely to act through effector cascades other than Mlph-myosin Va in non-melanocytic cells, given that Rab27a, but not Mlph or myosin Va mutations lead to immunodeficiency because of loss of CTL lytic granule exocytosis (14Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Hopkins C.R. Strom M. Barral D.C. Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Seabra M.C. Traffic. 2002; 3: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,18Haddad E.K., Wu, X. Hammer J.A., II Henkart P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The present results support this idea, and raise the possibility that one or more members of the Mlph family are acting in concert with Rab27a to regulate lytic granule exocytosis in CTLs. Another possibility is that Rab27a is acting sequentially with several effector proteins. Rab5, for example, interacts with a variety of effectors that are structurally and functionally unrelated to orchestrate a series of events that regulate early endosome dynamics (1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar). Future experiments should elucidate the mechanism of action of Rab27a in the different cell types.

In the present study we looked into its mechanism of inhibition. DHMEQ inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)- and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced transcriptional activity of NF-κB in human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells. It also inhibited the TNF-α-induced DNA binding of nuclear NF-κB but not the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. Moreover, DHMEQ inhibited the TNF-α-induced nuclear accumulation of p65, a component of NF-κB. It also inhibited TNF-α-induced nuclear transport of green fluorescent protein-tagged p65. On the other hand, DHMEQ did not inhibit the nuclear transport of Smad2 and large T antigen. Also, it did not inhibit TNF-α-induced activation of JNK but synergistically induced apoptosis with TNF-α in Jurkat cells. Taken together, these data indicate that DHMEQ is a unique inhibitor of NF-κB acting at the level of nuclear translocation.

Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). It promotes transcription of cytokines such as IL-1,1 IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α (2Shacov A.N.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3415) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a heterodimer mainly consisting of p65 (Rel A) and p50 proteins. The p65 and p50 proteins have a homologous sequence at their N-terminal regions (5Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 6Griffin G.E. Leung K. Folks T.M. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and NF-κB can form various heterodimers or homodimers. The NF-κB family proteins include p65, p50, p52, c-Rel, Rel B, v-Rel, Dorsal, Dif, and Relish (7Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar).NF-κB is activated by extracellular signals such as TNF-α (8Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Signal transduction pathways from the TNF-α receptor to NF-κB activation have been extensively studied (7Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). TNF-α receptors (TNFRs) include 55-kDa TNFR I and 75-kDa TNFR II (11Rothe J. Gehr G. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Immunol. Res. 1992; 11: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The ligand mainly acts through TNFR I, inducing its trimerization. For activation of NF-κB, TNFR-associated death domain protein recruits receptor-interacting protein and TNFR-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) (13Aggarwal B.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2000; 59: 6-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAF2 activates MEKK3, which is a mitogen-activated protein kinase. MEKK3 then activates IκB kinase (IKK), which induces the phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB). Phosphorylation of IκB induces its ubiquitination and degradation by proteasomes. Liberated NF-κB molecules then enter the nucleus where they bind to the κB site of DNA.TNF-α is an apoptosis-inducing factor (14Carswell E.A. Old L.J. Kassel R.L. Green S. Fiore N. Williamson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3666-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (3723) Google Scholar, 15Old L.J. Science. 1985; 230: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) as suggested by its name, and the TNF receptor contains the death domain, like Fas (16Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N.

Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). However, TNF-α does not induce apoptosis in most cases, because TNF-α also induces activation of NF-κB, which was found to inhibit apoptosis (19Antwerp D.J.V. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar, 20Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 21Wang C.Y.

Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar).Low molecular weight inhibitors of NF-κB should be useful as immunosuppressants and as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anticancer agents. Such inhibitors from natural sources include panepoxydone, cycloepoxydon, and gliotoxin. Panepoxydone was isolated from the basidiomycete Lentinus crinitus. It inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB in a promoter-reporter assay using COS-7 cells (23Erkel G. Anke T. Sterner O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Panepoxydone was suggested to inhibit TNF-α- or TPA-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. Cycloepoxydon was also isolated from a deuteromycete strain as an NF-κB inhibitor in COS-1 cells (24Gehrt A. Erkel G. Anke T. Sterner O. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1998; 51: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Gliotoxin produced by fungi was also reported to inhibit the activation of NF-κB by preventing the degradation of IκB (25Pahl H.L. Krauo B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Decker T. Tranckner E.B.-M. Vogt M.

More recently, a peptide that inhibits the interaction of IκB complex and NF-κB essential modifier was designed for the inhibition of NF-κB activation (28May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). However, further effective NF-κB inhibitors of low molecular weight are necessary for therapeutic development.In the course of our search for inhibitors of NF-κB function, we have designed new NF-κB inhibitors of low molecular weight from the structure of the antibiotic epoxyquinomicin C (29Matsumoto N. Ariga A., To-e, S. Nakamura H. Agata N. Hirano S. Inoue J. Umezawa K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 30Umezawa K. Ariga A. Matsumoto N. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 2000; 15: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar). One of the designed compounds, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ, formerly DHM2EQ (Fig. 1)), inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and was effective in suppressing rheumatoid arthritis in an in vivo model. In this report we studied the mechanism of inhibition by DHMEQ and found that DHMEQ inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB.DISCUSSIONThe number of known roles of NF-κB is rapidly increasing. For instance, erythropoietin was shown to inhibit apoptosis of neuronal cells by activating JAK2 to increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκB (33Digicaylioglu M. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 412: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). On the other hand, NF-κB is often activated in breast cancer cells possibly through the activation of CK2 (34Romieu-Mourez R. Landesman-Bollag E. Seldin D.C. Traish A.M. Mercurio F. Sonenshein G.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3810-3818PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of IKK and NF-κB was also reported in human melanoma cell lines (35Yang J. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4901-4909PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB would provide apoptotic resistance in these neoplastic tumors. NF-κB is also constitutively activated in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells (36Palayoor S.T. Youmell M.Y. Calderwood S.K. Coleman C.N. Price B.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7389-7394Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and genetic introduction of degradation-resistant IκB induced cell death selectively in these cancer cells (37Sumitomo M. Tachibana M. Ozu C. Asakura H. Murai M. Hayakawa M. Miyajima A. Kimura F. Hayakawa M. Nakamura H. Takayanagi A. Shimizu N. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We confirmed that DHMEQ inactivated NF-κB in constitutively activated bladder carcinoma cells. 2A. Ariga, J.-i. Namekawa, N. Matsumoto, J.-i. Inoue, and K. Umezawa, unpublished results. Therefore, NF-κB inhibitors may be useful for chemotherapy for both neoplastic diseases in which NF-κB is activated and for inflammation.Translocation of nuclear proteins containing the classic nuclear localization signal (NLS) such as SV40 T antigen is initiated by the formation of a complex consisting of the cargo protein and carrier proteins called importins (38Gorlish D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 39Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 40Turpin P. Ossareh-Nazari B. Dargemont C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Importin family members include the adaptor protein, importin-α, and the carrier protein, importin-β. Importin-α/β complex recognizes and interacts with the classic NLS, and the importins transport the cargo proteins to the nucleus through the nuclear pore. Importins dissociate from the cargo proteins in nucleus. In nonstimulated cells, NF-κB interacts with IκB, which masks the NLS of NF-κB (41Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheiman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 42Ganch P.A. Sun S.C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB thus allows exposure of the NLS of NF-κB. Both p65 and p50 have the classic type of NLS; therefore, NF-κB uses the general nuclear translocation system (43Jans D.A. Xiao C.H. Lam M.H.C. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar).DHMEQ did not inhibit TNF-α-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκB in Jurkat and COS-1 cells, but it did inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in both cell lines. Therefore, the molecular target of the drug is likely to be involved in the protein complex for nuclear translocation. Because DHMEQ did not inhibit the translocation of other proteins such as Smad2 and large T antigen, it is unlikely that the drug blocks the general transport machineries such as importins and nuclear pore. Instead, it may bind to p65 or p50. A biotin-labeled analogue of DHMEQ is now being prepared for the detection of the target molecule.Most NF-κB inhibitors, including panepoxydone, are suggested to act as upstream targets of IκB degradation (23Erkel G. Anke T. Sterner O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Gehrt A. Erkel G. Anke T. Sterner O. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1998; 51: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Pahl H.L. Krauo B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Decker T. Tranckner E.B.-M. Vogt M. Myers C. Parks T. Warring P. Mühlbacher A. Czernilofsky A.-P. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both panepoxydone and DHMEQ contain the cyclohexylepoxydone structure, but their mechanism of action is completely different. Lin et al. (44Lin Y.-Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) designed and synthesized an inhibitor of NF-κB nuclear translocation called SN50 by conjugating the NLS of p50 to the amino acid sequence of the cell membrane-permeable motif. SN50 is considered to block the intracellular recognition system for the NLS of NF-κB. A similar mechanism cannot be excluded for DHMEQ. But SN50, a peptide consisting of 26 amino acids, is completely different in size and structure from DHMEQ.It is not known whether DHMEQ has any selectivity among NF-κB subunits. However, because DHMEQ almost completely inhibited the NF-κB activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human bladder carcinoma cells in which NF-κB is constitutively activated in addition to Jurkat and COS-1 cells, it is likely to inhibit a variety of NF-κB subunit dimers.It was recently reported that NF-κB down-regulates JNK. TNF-α-induced JNK activation was enhanced in IKK-β- and Rel A(p65)-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (45Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N., Li, Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 46De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Therefore, DHMEQ might up-regulate JNK in TNF-α-treated Jurkat cells. However, we found that DHMEQ alone activated JNK from 2 to 4 h in a time-dependent manner, and it was difficult to show the NF-κB-mediated activation of JNK by DHMEQ.DHMEQ was found to inhibit rheumatoid arthritis in a mouse model (29Matsumoto N. Ariga A., To-e, S. Nakamura H. Agata N. Hirano S. Inoue J. Umezawa K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because its weaker structural analogue, DHM3EQ, did not inhibit thein vivo model, the anti-inflammatory effect should be due to the inhibition of NF-κB. DHMEQ was derived from the weak antibiotic epoxyquinomicin, which showed no toxicity in mice. DHMEQ also showed no prominent toxicity in mice in the rheumatoid arthritis experiment or in other in vivo experiments. This agent, acting by a unique mechanism, may thus be a candidate for anti-inflammatory or anticancer therapy. NF-κB is the transcription factor that binds to the κB sequence (1Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). It promotes transcription of cytokines such as IL-1,1 IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α (2Shacov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 3Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and interferon-γ; cell adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1); and viral proteins (4Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3415) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a heterodimer mainly consisting of p65 (Rel A) and p50 proteins. The p65 and p50 proteins have a homologous sequence at their N-terminal regions (5Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 6Griffin G.E. Leung K. Folks T.M. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and NF-κB can form various heterodimers or homodimers. The NF-κB family proteins include p65, p50, p52, c-Rel, Rel B, v-Rel, Dorsal, Dif, and Relish (7Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated by extracellular signals such as TNF-α (8Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar, 9Israël A., Le Bail O. Hatat D. Piette J. Kieran M. Logeat F. Wallach D. Fellous M. Kourilsky P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), IL-1, lipopolysaccharide, UV, and phorbol esters (10Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Signal transduction pathways from the TNF-α receptor to NF-κB activation have been extensively studied (7Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). TNF-α receptors (TNFRs) include 55-kDa TNFR I and 75-kDa TNFR II (11Rothe J. Gehr G. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Immunol. Res. 1992; 11: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The ligand mainly acts through TNFR I, inducing its trimerization. For activation of NF-κB, TNFR-associated death domain protein recruits receptor-interacting protein and TNFR-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) (13Aggarwal B.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2000; 59: 6-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAF2 activates MEKK3, which is a mitogen-activated protein kinase. MEKK3 then activates IκB kinase (IKK), which induces the phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB). Phosphorylation of IκB induces its ubiquitination and degradation by proteasomes. Liberated NF-κB molecules then enter the nucleus where they bind to the κB site of DNA. TNF-α is an apoptosis-inducing factor (14Carswell E.A. Old L.J. Kassel R.L. Green S. Fiore N. Williamson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3666-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (3723) Google Scholar, 15Old L.J. Science. 1985; 230: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) as suggested by its name, and the TNF receptor contains the death domain, like Fas (16Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 479-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 17Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel V.

Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). However, TNF-α does not induce apoptosis in most cases, because TNF-α also induces activation of NF-κB, which was found to inhibit apoptosis (19Antwerp D.J.V. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar, 20Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 21Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). Excess apoptosis was observed in the liver of IKK-β knockout mice (22Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Low molecular weight inhibitors of NF-κB should be useful as immunosuppressants and as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anticancer agents. Such inhibitors from natural sources include panepoxydone, cycloepoxydon, and gliotoxin. Panepoxydone was isolated from the basidiomycete Lentinus crinitus. It inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB in a promoter-reporter assay using COS-7 cells (23Erkel G. Anke T. Sterner O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Panepoxydone was suggested to inhibit TNF-α- or TPA-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. Cycloepoxydon was also isolated from a deuteromycete strain as an NF-κB inhibitor in COS-1 cells (24Gehrt A. Erkel G. Anke T. Sterner O. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1998; 51: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Gliotoxin produced by fungi was also reported to inhibit the activation of NF-κB by preventing the degradation of IκB (25Pahl H.L. Krauo B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Decker T. Tranckner E.B.-M. Vogt M. Myers C. Parks T. Warring P. Mühlbacher A. Czernilofsky A.-P. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Synthetic adenyl carbocyclic nucleoside (26Xia D. Wang F. Parmely M.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) ando,o′-bismyristoyl thiamine disulfide (27Shoji S. Furuishi K. Ogata A. Yamataka K. Tachibana K. Mukai R. Uda A. Harano K. Matsushita S. Misumi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were also reported to inhibit NF-κB activation by unknown mechanisms. More recently, a peptide that inhibits the interaction of IκB complex and NF-κB essential modifier was designed for the inhibition of NF-κB activation (28May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). However, further effective NF-κB inhibitors of low molecular weight are necessary for therapeutic development. In the course of our search for inhibitors of NF-κB function, we have designed new NF-κB inhibitors of low molecular weight from the structure of the antibiotic epoxyquinomicin C (29Matsumoto N. Ariga A., To-e, S. Nakamura H. Agata N. Hirano S. Inoue J. Umezawa K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 30Umezawa K. Ariga A. Matsumoto N. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 2000; 15: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar). One of the designed compounds, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ, formerly DHM2EQ (Fig. 1)), inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and was effective in suppressing rheumatoid arthritis in an in vivo model. In this report we studied the mechanism of inhibition by DHMEQ and found that DHMEQ inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. DISCUSSIONThe number of known roles of NF-κB is rapidly increasing. For instance, erythropoietin was shown to inhibit apoptosis of neuronal cells by activating JAK2 to increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκB (33Digicaylioglu M. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 412: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). On the other hand, NF-κB is often activated in breast cancer cells possibly through the activation of CK2 (34Romieu-Mourez R. Landesman-Bollag E. Seldin D.C. Traish A.M. Mercurio F. Sonenshein G.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3810-3818PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of IKK and NF-κB was also reported in human melanoma cell lines (35Yang J. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4901-4909PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB would provide apoptotic resistance in these neoplastic tumors. NF-κB is also constitutively activated in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells (36Palayoor S.T. Youmell M.Y. Calderwood S.K. Coleman C.N. Price B.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7389-7394Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and genetic introduction of degradation-resistant IκB induced cell death selectively in these cancer cells (37Sumitomo M. Tachibana M. Ozu C. Asakura H. Murai M. Hayakawa M. Miyajima A. Kimura F. Hayakawa M. Nakamura H. Takayanagi A. Shimizu N. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We confirmed that DHMEQ inactivated NF-κB in constitutively activated bladder carcinoma cells. 2A. Ariga, J.-i. Namekawa, N. Matsumoto, J.-i. Inoue, and K. Umezawa, unpublished results. Therefore, NF-κB inhibitors may be useful for chemotherapy for both neoplastic diseases in which NF-κB is activated and for inflammation.Translocation of nuclear proteins containing the classic nuclear localization signal (NLS) such as SV40 T antigen is initiated by the formation of a complex consisting of the cargo protein and carrier proteins called importins (38Gorlish D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 39Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 40Turpin P. Ossareh-Nazari B. Dargemont C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Importin family members include the adaptor protein, importin-α, and the carrier protein, importin-β. Importin-α/β complex recognizes and interacts with the classic NLS, and the importins transport the cargo proteins to the nucleus through the nuclear pore. Importins dissociate from the cargo proteins in nucleus. In nonstimulated cells, NF-κB interacts with IκB, which masks the NLS of NF-κB (41Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheiman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A.

Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB thus allows exposure of the NLS of NF-κB. Both p65 and p50 have the classic type of NLS; therefore, NF-κB uses the general nuclear translocation system (43Jans D.A. Xiao C.H. Lam M.H.C. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar).DHMEQ did not inhibit TNF-α-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκB in Jurkat and COS-1 cells, but it did inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in both cell lines. Therefore, the molecular target of the drug is likely to be involved in the protein complex for nuclear translocation. Because DHMEQ did not inhibit the translocation of other proteins such as Smad2 and large T antigen, it is unlikely that the drug blocks the general transport machineries such as importins and nuclear pore. Instead, it may bind to p65 or p50. A biotin-labeled analogue of DHMEQ is now being prepared for the detection of the target molecule.Most NF-κB inhibitors, including panepoxydone, are suggested to act as upstream targets of IκB degradation (23Erkel G.

Interestingly, both panepoxydone and DHMEQ contain the cyclohexylepoxydone structure, but their mechanism of action is completely different. Lin et al. (44Lin Y.-Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R.

SN50 is considered to block the intracellular recognition system for the NLS of NF-κB. A similar mechanism cannot be excluded for DHMEQ. But SN50, a peptide consisting of 26 amino acids, is completely different in size and structure from DHMEQ.It is not known whether DHMEQ has any selectivity among NF-κB subunits.

Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 39Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 40Turpin P. Ossareh-Nazari B. Dargemont C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Importin family members include the adaptor protein, importin-α, and the carrier protein, importin-β. Importin-α/β complex recognizes and interacts with the classic NLS, and the importins transport the cargo proteins to the nucleus through the nuclear pore. Importins dissociate from the cargo proteins in nucleus. In nonstimulated cells, NF-κB interacts with IκB, which masks the NLS of NF-κB (41Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheiman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 42Ganch P.A. Sun S.C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB thus allows exposure of the NLS of NF-κB. Both p65 and p50 have the classic type of NLS; therefore, NF-κB uses the general nuclear translocation system (43Jans D.A. Xiao C.H. Lam M.H.C. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). DHMEQ did not inhibit TNF-α-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκB in Jurkat and COS-1 cells, but it did inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in both cell lines. Therefore, the molecular target of the drug is likely to be involved in the protein complex for nuclear translocation. Because DHMEQ did not inhibit the translocation of other proteins such as Smad2 and large T antigen, it is unlikely that the drug blocks the general transport machineries such as importins and nuclear pore. Instead, it may bind to p65 or p50. A biotin-labeled analogue of DHMEQ is now being prepared for the detection of the target molecule. Most NF-κB inhibitors, including panepoxydone, are suggested to act as upstream targets of IκB degradation (23Erkel G. Anke T. Sterner O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Gehrt A. Erkel G. Anke T. Sterner O. J. Antibiot.

Czernilofsky A.-P. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both panepoxydone and DHMEQ contain the cyclohexylepoxydone structure, but their mechanism of action is completely different. Lin et al. (44Lin Y.-Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) designed and synthesized an inhibitor of NF-κB nuclear translocation called SN50 by conjugating the NLS of p50 to the amino acid sequence of the cell membrane-permeable motif. SN50 is considered to block the intracellular recognition system for the NLS of NF-κB. A similar mechanism cannot be excluded for DHMEQ. But SN50, a peptide consisting of 26 amino acids, is completely different in size and structure from DHMEQ. It is not known whether DHMEQ has any selectivity among NF-κB subunits. However, because DHMEQ almost completely inhibited the NF-κB activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human bladder carcinoma cells in which NF-κB is constitutively activated in addition to Jurkat and COS-1 cells, it is likely to inhibit a variety of NF-κB subunit dimers. It was recently reported that NF-κB down-regulates JNK. TNF-α-induced JNK activation was enhanced in IKK-β- and Rel A(p65)-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (45Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N., Li, Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 46De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Therefore, DHMEQ might up-regulate JNK in TNF-α-treated Jurkat cells. However, we found that DHMEQ alone activated JNK from 2 to 4 h in a time-dependent manner, and it was difficult to show the NF-κB-mediated activation of JNK by DHMEQ. DHMEQ was found to inhibit rheumatoid arthritis in a mouse model (29Matsumoto N. Ariga A., To-e, S. Nakamura H. Agata N. Hirano S. Inoue J. Umezawa K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because its weaker structural analogue, DHM3EQ, did not inhibit thein vivo model, the anti-inflammatory effect should be due to the inhibition of NF-κB. DHMEQ was derived from the weak antibiotic epoxyquinomicin, which showed no toxicity in mice. DHMEQ also showed no prominent toxicity in mice in the rheumatoid arthritis experiment or in other in vivo experiments. This agent, acting by a unique mechanism, may thus be a candidate for anti-inflammatory or anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2011894191,"Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a mitochondrial flavoprotein that triggers caspase-independent apoptosis. We describe here the cloning and characterization of a novel AIF-homologous molecule designated AMID (AIF-homologous mitochondrion-associatedinducer of death). AMID lacks a mitochondrial localization sequence but shares significant homology with AIF and NADH oxidoreductases from bacteria to mammalian species. Immunofluorescent staining and biochemical experiments indicated that AMID was co-localized with mitochondria. Overexpression of AMID induced cell death with characteristic apoptotic morphology. Furthermore, AMID-induced apoptosis was independent of caspase activation and p53 and was not inhibited by Bcl-2. These findings suggest that AMID induces a novel caspase-independent apoptotic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2154343843,"A family of protein tyrosine phosphatases enriched within the central nervous system called striatal enriched phosphatase (STEP) has been implicated in the regulation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. STEP61, a membrane-associated isoform located in the postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of striatal neurons, contains two transmembrane domains, two proline-rich domains, and a kinase-interacting motif. This study demonstrates that STEP61 associates with Fyn, a member of the Src family kinases that is also enriched in PSDs. By using human embryonic kidney 293 cells for co-transfection, we determined that a substrate-trapping variant (STEP61 CS) binds to Fyn but not to other members of the Src family present in PSDs. In a complementary experiment, myc-tagged Fyn immunoprecipitates STEP61 CS. STEP61 binds to Fyn through one of its proline-rich domains and the kinase-interacting motif domain, whereas Fyn binds to STEP61 through its Src homology 2 domain and the unique N-terminal domain. STEP61 CS pulls down Fyn when the Tyr420 site is phosphorylated. In vitro, wild-type STEP61 dephosphorylates Fyn at Tyr420but not at Tyr531. These results suggest that STEP regulates the activity of Fyn by specifically dephosphorylating the regulatory Tyr420 and may be one mechanism by which Fyn activity is decreased within PSDs.

These proteins are highly conserved in their amino acid sequences and their regulatory domains. Each member also contains a unique domain at the N terminus that distinguishes it from other family members (see review, Ref. 1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). Src and Fyn are present within postsynaptic densities of central nervous system neurons (2Walikonis R.S. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Provance D.W. Mercer J.A. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4069-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Their presence at the PSD and their direct association with both receptors and key anchoring proteins such as PSD-95 (4Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) suggest that they regulate signaling events within these neurons. Indeed, several recent studies show that members of the Src kinase family modulate synaptic transmission by regulating the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins within the PSD including the NR2 subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (5Lau L.F. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20036-20041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 6Kohr G. Seeburg P.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 445-452Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The Src family kinases are themselves regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. They contain two conserved tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated (tyrosine 420 and tyrosine 531; numbering according to the amino acid sequence of human Fyn). Phosphorylation of tyrosine 531 of Fyn by C-terminal Src kinase leads to its inactivation (7Sun G. Sharma A.K. Budde R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Superti-Furga G. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of this site results in a conformational change and activation of the protein through autophosphorylation at the second site, Tyr420. The dynamic balance in the level of phosphorylation at these two sites contributes to the overall level of Fyn kinase activity. Therefore, the identification of tyrosine phosphatases that lead to the dephosphorylation of one regulatory site or the other would add to the understanding of how these kinases are regulated. The striatal enriched phosphatase (STEP) family of PTPs is enriched within specific subsets of neurons in the central nervous system (9Lombroso P.J. Naegele J.R. Sharma E. Lerner M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3064-3074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,10Boulanger L.M. Lombroso P.J. Raghunathan A. During M.J. Wahle P. Naegele J.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1532-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). STEP61 is one member of this family. It contains two polyproline domains that meet the consensus sequence for motifs involved in protein-protein interactions (11Bult A. Zhao F. Dirkx R., Jr. Sharma E. Lukacsi E. Solimena M. Naegele J.R. Lombroso P.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7821-7831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, STEP61 contains a kinase-interacting motif (KIM) that has been identified as a domain required for the binding of STEP to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in vitro(12Blanco-Aparicio C. Torres J. Pulido R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). STEP61 is regulated, in part, by dopamine signaling through a D1/cAMP/protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the serine residue within the KIM domain. Phosphorylation at that site leads to a decrease in its enzymatic activity against substrates (13Paul S. Snyder G.L. Yokakura H. Picciotto M.R. Nairn A.C. Lombroso P.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5630-5638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, this serine is dephosphorylated after the activation of NMDA receptors, leading to an increase in its phosphatase activity 2S. Paul, A. C. Nairn, P. Wang, and P. J. Lombroso, submitted for publication.2S. Paul, A. C. Nairn, P. Wang, and P. J. Lombroso, submitted for publication. and inhibition of ERK1/2-mediated signaling pathways within these neurons. STEP61 is present in the PSDs of neurons that receive both dopaminergic and glutamatergic synaptic input (14Gurd J.W. Bissoon N. Nguyen T.-H. Lombroso P.J. Rider C.C. Beesley P.W. Vannucci S.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1990-1994PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nguyen T.-H. Paul S., Xu, Y. Gurd J.W. Lombroso P.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1995-2001PubMed Google Scholar, 16Oyama T. Goto S. Nishi T. Sato K. Yamada K. Yoshikawa M. Ushio Y. Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). STEP61 was recently shown to co-immunoprecipitate as part of the NMDA complex of proteins (17Pelkey K.A. Askalan R. Paul S. Kalia L.V. Nguyen T.-H. Pitcher G.M. Salter M.W. Lombroso P.J. Neuron. 2002; 34: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Application of STEP to the cytoplasmic side of membrane patches from embryonic spinal cord neurons led to a depression in NMDA-mediated activity. In contrast, application of functionally inhibiting STEP antibodies led to an increase in NMDA receptor synaptic currents. Finally, application of STEP postsynaptically prevented the induction of long-term potentiation by tetanic stimulation in the CA1 region of hippocampal neurons (17Pelkey K.A. Askalan R. Paul S. Kalia L.V. Nguyen T.-H. Pitcher G.M. Salter M.W. Lombroso P.J. Neuron. 2002; 34: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, STEP appears to counter the activity of Src family members known to up-regulate synaptic transmission at excitatory synapses (18Yu X.M. Salter M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7697-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms by which this occurs remain unclear. Recent studies have shown that the receptor-like PTP, PTPα, plays a role in modulating the activity of Src and Fyn by dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine 531 both in vivo and in vitro(19Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The identification of additional PTPs that might participate in regulating these kinases was the goal of the present study. Because there are two regulatory tyrosine residues among Src family members, it was hypothesized that a second PTP might independently regulate the phosphorylated tyrosine at amino acid 420. Here, we demonstrate that STEP61 binds to Fyn both in vitro and in vivo. The domains in both proteins that govern this interaction were identified. In STEP61, both the KIM domain and the N-terminal proline-rich domain are involved. In Fyn, the SH2 domain and the unique N-terminal domain are responsible for the observed interaction. Finally, tyrosine 420, but not tyrosine 531, is dephosphorylated by STEP61. These results suggest that STEP61 participates in regulating Fyn activity and that this is one mechanism by which STEP regulates signaling events at excitatory synapses. All experimental procedures used in the present study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University School of Medicine. Adult, female Long Evans rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Subcellular fractionation was performed with modifications to the methods described in previous publications (11Bult A. Zhao F. Dirkx R., Jr. Sharma E. Lukacsi E. Solimena M. Naegele J.R. Lombroso P.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7821-7831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nguyen T.-H. Paul S., Xu, Y. Gurd J.W. Lombroso P.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1995-2001PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, rats were euthanized, and the striatum was dissected on ice and homogenized in 10-fold (w/v) cold buffer (320 mm sucrose, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Homogenized tissue was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to form S1 and P1 fractions. The S1 fraction was further centrifuged at 9,000 ×g for 15 min to form a crude synaptosomal fraction (P2). This fraction was then washed in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 10,200 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was lysed in a 10× volume of cold water and immediately buffered to 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Lysed synaptosomes were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to form LS1 and LP1 fractions. The LP1 fraction was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose and HEPES, pH 7.4, and additional protease inhibitors were added before overlaying the sample on a gradient consisting of 4 ml of 0.8m sucrose, 1 ml of 1.0 m sucrose, and 4 ml of 1.2 m sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 2 h. Samples from the 1.0–1.2 msucrose interface were collected and washed in a 10× volume of cold PBS at 48,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting PSDs were resuspended in PBS and frozen at −80 °C until needed. pGEX-STEP46 was transformed into BL21 cells and grown at 37 °C until log phase before induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 0.01 culture volume with PBS, and lysed in B-Per according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Cell lysate was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was passed through a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed extensively with PBS, and recombinant protein was eluted by using 10 mm glutathione in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. STEP-GST recombinant protein was concentrated with a Centriplus-30 column (Millipore) before passing through Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with PBS to remove the glutathione peptide. GST-STEP fusion protein was coupled toN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose-4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, unconjugated protein was removed in cold PBS, and nonreactive groups were blocked with ethanolamine buffer (0.5 m ethanolamine, 0.5m NaCl, pH 8.3) for 1 h at room temperature. Uncoupled protein was alternatively washed with ethanolamine buffer and acetate buffer (0.1 m acetate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 4.0) before a final wash with cold PBS. The GST-STEP46-conjugated Sepharose matrix was then used to pack an affinity column. The rat brain P2 fraction was solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was collected and diluted 5-fold with cold PBS before passing through the GST-STEP46 affinity column, which was then extensively washed with PBS-1% Triton X-100 followed by PBS without detergent with normal (150 mm) or high (500 mm) NaCl concentrations. Any bound protein was eluted with low pH buffer (0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5) and quickly neutralized in the presence of 1.0 m Tris, pH 9.0. Eluted material was pooled, concentrated with Centriplus-10 (Millipore), and analyzed by using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. STEP cDNA was constructed in pGEX-2T vector as described previously (21Lombroso P.J. Murdoch G. Lerner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The GST-STEP open reading frame was amplified by using PCR with primers GST-KpnI (5′-CACGGGGTACCACCATGGCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGG-3′) and STEP NotI (5′-ACGATGAAGCGGCCGCTCACTCTGAGGACTGGAGGGAC-3′) (where the italic letters denote the restriction sites forKpnI and NotI and the underlined letters denote the Kozak sequences), in which KpnI and NotI restriction sites were added, and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). In addition, a Kozak sequence was added within the GST-KpnI primer for enhanced expression in mammalian cells. The control vector expressing only GST was also made using the same GST-KpnI primer and a different GST-NotI primer (5′-ACGATGAAGCGGCCGCTCAGGATCCACGCGGAACCAG-3′). Human Fyn cDNA (pCMV-hFyn) was a generous gift of M. D. Resh (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). The open reading frame of Fyn was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pCMV-Myc-tagged vector (Stratagene). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate constitutively active or inactive mutant Fyn by using TurboPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). STEP and Fyn deletion constructs were performed according to instructions (Excite; Stratagene) (see Fig. 1 for DNA constructs). PCR products were cleaned with the Qiagen PCR clean kit, phosphorylated with T4 kinase, and ligated by using T4 ligase (New England Biolab). HEK293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1573) and maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum. Transfections were performed as described previously (15Nguyen T.-H. Paul S., Xu, Y. Gurd J.W. Lombroso P.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1995-2001PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, a day before transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish. The next day, DNA was mixed with FuGENE 6 (1:3), incubated briefly, and applied directly onto cells. All steps were done either on ice or at 4 °C, unless otherwise specified. Transfected cells were solubilized in IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Brij-96, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml of both leupeptin and aprotinin). Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was precleared with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and then incubated with 5 μg of anti-myc antibody overnight. An aliquot of 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose was added the next day to the sample and incubated for 1 h. The beads were washed four times in IP buffer. Proteins were eluted with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE buffer and analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE. For pull-down experiments, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA-GST-STEP, pCVM-hFyn, or control vector pCMV. Thirty-six h after transfection, cells were lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Brij-96, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate (Na3VO4), and 10 μg/ml of both aprotinin and leupeptin. The lysate was vortexed briefly and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. Fifty μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4 CL beads were added to the supernatants and incubated for 1 h, followed by four washes with lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiling. HEK293 cells were transfected with pCMV-myc-Fyn wild-type plasmid DNA. Thirty-six h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. After the last wash, antigen-antibody-protein G-Sepharose complex was washed with 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 5 mmEDTA. Purified STEP61-GST was added to Sepharose beads and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Beads were washed once in lysis buffer containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 30 min and incubated with primary antibody in PBST either overnight at 4 °C or for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:40,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was reacted with chemiluminescent substrate from Pierce. Anti-Fyn monoclonal antibody (Chemicon) was used at 1:400 with an overnight incubation. Anti-phospho-Src-Y420 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling, whereas anti-phospho-Fyn Y531 was obtained from BioSource. The monoclonal antibody against STEP (23E5) was used at 1:1000 in PBST at room temperature as described previously (10Boulanger L.M. Lombroso P.J. Raghunathan A. During M.J. Wahle P. Naegele J.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1532-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nguyen T.-H. Paul S., Xu, Y. Gurd J.W. Lombroso P.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1995-2001PubMed Google Scholar). For reprobing, membranes were stripped for 30 min at room temperature with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS) and then reacted with chemiluminescent to check for the completeness of stripping. A substrate trapping strategy was used in an initial attempt to identify physiologically relevant substrates of STEP. Similar strategies have been used to identify proteins that associate with a number of PTPs after critical amino acids are mutated in order to make the PTP enzymatically inactive (23Buist A. Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20754-20761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Rat brain samples were passed over a catalytically inactive STEP46CS-GST column and washed extensively under moderately stringent conditions (i.e. 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100). Bound proteins were eluted with low pH buffer and analyzed for the presence of STEP-associated proteins. Mitogen-activated protein kinase has previously been reported to associate with STEP and served as a positive control for these experiments (25Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). We next looked for the association of STEP with members of the Src kinase family, including Fyn, Src, and Lyn. Western blot analysis determined that, of these proteins, only Fyn was present in the eluate. Pyk2, a calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase present within PSDs, was also analyzed. Parallel analyses indicated that neither Src or Pyk2 bound to the column (Fig.2). Immunoblotting for Lyn showed results similar to those for Src and Pyk2 (data not shown). These results indicate that under the conditions used in these experiments, Fyn binds to a substrate-trapping construct of STEP. The next experiments determined whether the association of Fyn with STEP could be replicated in cell lines and whether one or another of the various STEP isoforms bound preferentially to Fyn. Various GST-STEP constructs were co-transfected with Fyn into HEK293 cells, and pull-down experiments were performed (Fig.3 A). The results indicate that Fyn was pulled down to some degree by all STEP isoforms (STEP46 wild-type, the inactive CS mutant, STEP61 wild-type, and its inactive variant). The control GST failed to pull down any Fyn. STEP46 is an alternatively spliced variant within the STEP family of proteins. Both STEP46 and STEP61 isoforms contain the KIM domain. They differ by the presence in STEP61 of a novel 172-amino acid region at the N terminus that contains two transmembrane and two polyproline domains. STEP46 pulling down Fyn in the co-transfected cell lines is consistent with the observation from the STEP46 affinity column chromatography. Moreover, the substrate-trapping, inactive STEP61 variant pulled down more Fyn than its active isoform. In addition, the highest levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated Fyn were associated with the inactive STEP61 CS variant. These results suggest that Fyn associates most strongly with STEP61. Complementary pull-down experiments were performed. Inactive STEP61 was co-transfected with a myc-tagged Fyn. Anti-myc tag antibody was used to immunoprecipitate myc-Fyn, and the samples were analyzed for the presence of STEP (Fig. 3 B). STEP61 CS was detected with the myc tagged-Fyn sample but was not detected in the control lanes. Similar co-transfection of STEP61 and Src was performed. Src was not detected to associate with either the wild-type or the substrate-trapping mutant (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these results suggest that STEP61 interacts with the tyrosine kinase Fyn. These experiments were designed to determine the Fyn binding domain in STEP61. cDNA constructs that contained deletions of either of the two polyproline domains (PP1 and PP2) or the KIM domain (see Fig. 1) were co-transfected with Fyn cDNA. The ability of the resulting mutants to associate with Fyn was assessed (Fig. 4 A). Full-length inactive STEP61 CS once again associated with Fyn. Deletion of either the PP1 or the KIM domain in the inactive variant decreased the amount of Fyn pulled down. Interestingly, deletion of PP2 in the wild-type variant enhanced the binding of STEP to Fyn. These results suggest that the KIM and polyproline domains are involved in the binding of STEP61 with Fyn. In a complementary series of experiments, different Fyn domains were deleted and co-transfected with full-length STEP61 CS. As expected, the inactive STEP61 isoform bound with full-length Fyn. It also bound with the Fyn construct that contained an SH3 deletion. The Fyn construct with either an SH2 or the unique domain deletion failed to bind to STEP61 (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that the SH3 domain of Fyn is not critical for the binding to STEP61, whereas the SH2 and the unique domains of Fyn appear to be necessary for the observed interactions with STEP. Two regulatory tyrosines are phosphorylated in Fyn and regulate its activity. These two tyrosine residues serve as potential targets for STEP. In an initial series of experiments, we compared the relative association of the substrate-trapping STEP61 CS isoform to wild-type Fyn, compared with its association to the Fyn variants that contain mutations at either tyrosine 420 (Y420F) or tyrosine 531 (Y531F). After co-transfection, STEP61 fusion protein was pulled down and analyzed for the presence of Fyn (Fig.5 A). For these experiments, antibodies were used that specifically recognize each of the tyrosine-phosphorylated sites. STEP61 CS pulled down wild-type Fyn and the Y531F mutant. The latter construct is not phosphorylated at the 531 site but is constitutively phosphorylated at the Tyr420 residue (Fig. 5 A, top panel). In contrast, when tyrosine 420 was mutated, STEP61 was no longer able to associate with Fyn (Fig.5 A, bottom panel). These results suggest that phosphorylation at tyrosine 420 of Fyn is necessary for the observed association with the substrate-trapping STEP61 CS variant. We next determined whether Fyn was preferentially dephosphorylated at either of these sites by STEP. These experiments were performed in the presence of EDTA to prevent autophosphorylation of Fyn. Active GST-STEP61 fusion protein was added to the immunoprecipitated wild-type myc-Fyn. The phosphotyrosine level at each site was then detected by using anti-phospho-Tyr420 and anti-phospho-Tyr531 antibodies (Fig. 5 B). Anti-Fyn was used to demonstrate equal loading in each lane, and anti-STEP was used to show the increasing amounts of STEP61fusion protein. These results indicate a clear decrease in phospho-Tyr420 levels with increasing amounts of STEP protein. In contrast, there was no difference in phospho-Tyr531 levels, suggesting that STEP61is specifically recognizing and dephosphorylating phospho-Tyr420 in vitro. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (26Edmonds B. Gibb A.J. Colquhoun D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 495-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The NMDA receptor is one of several glutamate-responsive receptors that have been implicated in key signaling pathways including synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and excitotoxicity (27Choi D.W. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 465-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, 28McDonald J.W. Johnston M.V. Brain Res. Brain Res.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors is one mechanism by which the activity of these receptors can be regulated. Tyrosine phosphorylation up-regulates NMDA receptors and increases ion flow through these channels. Several members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases have been implicated in these processes, including Src, Fyn, and abl (6Kohr G. Seeburg P.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 445-452Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 30Rosenblum K. Dudai Y. Richter-Levin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). These kinases are themselves phosphorylated on two regulatory tyrosine residues that have opposing functions (one inhibits kinase activity, and the other enhances kinase activity). Thus, the identification of tyrosine phosphatases that act specifically on one or the other phosphorylation site would add an additional degree of control of the kinases involved in tyrosine-phosphorylating key regulatory proteins, receptors, and other substrates within the PSD. The major finding in the present study was that STEP associated with Fyn and dephosphorylated one of its two regulatory tyrosine residues (Tyr420). Several lines of evidence support this model. The initial affinity chromatography experiment using rat brain homogenates as the starting material showed that Fyn bound to a substrate-trapping variant of STEP. A positive control for the experiment was finding that ERK1/2 also bound to the column because these proteins had previously been shown to interact directly with STEP (12Blanco-Aparicio C. Torres J. Pulido R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In the present study, the eluate was further analyzed for the specificity of the results by looking for other kinase members also present in PSDs, such as Src, Lyn, or Pyk2; these proteins are not detected. By using co-transfection experiments, we demonstrated that STEP and Fyn interact in mammalian cells. These experiments show that some STEP isoforms associate more strongly than others. In particular, STEP61 pulled down tyrosine-phosphorylated Fyn more effectively than STEP46. The complementary series of experiments pulled down myc-tagged Fyn and demonstrate a similar interaction with STEP61. The substrate-trapping variant of STEP61 bound to the wild-type and to the Y531F form of Fyn, but not the Y420F isoform, suggesting that under the conditions used in these experiments, there is some degree of specificity in that STEP requires one but not the other tyrosine residue to be present and phosphorylated in order to bind to Fyn. We also mapped specific binding domains within STEP61 and Fyn. Both the N-terminal proline-rich domain (PP1) and the KIM domain in STEP61 appear to be necessary for binding because constructs with a deletion of either fail to interact with Fyn. The KIM domain had previously been identified as a binding domain in STEP required for association with mitogen-activated protein kinase (12Blanco-Aparicio C. Torres J. Pulido R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The present results suggest that this domain may also be necessary for interaction with additional proteins, including the tyrosine kinase Fyn. The domains in Fyn that are necessary for binding to STEP61appear to include the SH2 and the unique N-terminal domains. When the unique domain of Fyn is deleted, Fyn fails to associate with STEP61. This observation is in line with our initial experiment indicating that both Src and Lyn with different unique domains fail to associate with STEP isoforms. These results suggest that Fyn is in an active state or “open” conformation when associated with STEP. In an inactive state or “closed” conformation, the SH2 domain binds to its phosphorylated Tyr531 through an intramolecular association. Upon stimulation, the phosphorylated Tyr531 is dephosphorylated by a nearby PTP. Fyn autophosphorylates the Tyr420 site and releases the SH2 domain from intramolecular association. Subsequently, active STEP61 dephosphorylates Tyr420. This permits the free SH2 domain to bind to other phospho-tyrosine and possibly to the PTP catalytic domain of STEP (35Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 36Yaffe M.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The PP1 domain and the KIM motif of STEP61 stabilize the association between STEP and Fyn. In summary, our results suggest that STEP binds to Fyn and specifically dephosphorylates the regulatory tyrosine at amino acid 420. A recent finding demonstrated that PTPα also binds to Fyn but in this case specifically dephosphorylates Tyr531 (20Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The binding of PTPα to Fyn is independent of its phosphatase domain and requires an interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated PTPα and the SH2 domain of Fyn (19Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37Su J. Yang L.T. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28086-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the further regulation of Fyn by STEP described in this study is responsible for the regulation of NMDA receptors at the PSD.

TauCl treatment inhibited tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-initiated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. TauCl did not inhibit either the upstream of IκB kinase (IKK) activation or IKK itself but did inhibit NF-κB activation induced by IKK overexpression. Deletion experiments showed that a TauCl modification site causing the band shift of IκBα is Met45. High performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses of a small peptide containing Met45 revealed that TauCl oxidizes Met45. A mutant of IκBα whose Met45 was converted to alanine did not generate a band shift upon TauCl treatment and degraded in response to TNFα stimulation. However, a reporter assay revealed that NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression was not fully recovered in cells transfected with this mutant. These results indicate that Met45 oxidation of IκBα is a molecular mechanism underlying the TauCl-induced inhibition of NF-κB activation. A similar band shift was observed when HL-60 cells expressing myeloperoxidase were treated with 100 μm hydrogen peroxide for 5 min.

A well known function of this amino acid is to increase solubility and intestinal absorption of ingested lipids as taurine conjugated with bile acid (1Zelikovic I. Chesney R.W. Spiller G.A. Scala J. New Protective Roles for Selected Nutrients. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 253-294Google Scholar). In neutrophils, taurine is the most abundant free amino acid (2Fukuda K. Hirai Y. Yoshida H. Nakajima T. Usui T. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 1758-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Neutrophils are one of the white blood cells that have an important role in the host defense against bacterial infection. When neutrophils phagocytose invading bacteria, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)1 is activated (3McDonald P.P. Cassatella M.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 538-586Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). NF-κB consisting of heterodimer of RelA and p50 is retained in the cytoplasm as an inactive tertiary complex with inhibitory proteins known as IκBs. For example, when tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) binds to its receptor, IκB kinase (IKK) is activated through intracellular signal pathway (4Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This activated kinase phosphorylates IκBα protein on Ser32 and Ser36 (5Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar), which leads to ubiquitination on Lys21 and Lys22followed by proteasome-dependent degradation (6Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Krönke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). The degradation and dissociation of IκBα from NF-κB leads to the nuclear transfer of NF-κB, and subsequent gene expression is initiated (7Lloyd A.R. Oppenheim J.J. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 169-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 8Cassatella M.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 21-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, phagocytosis of bacteria also triggers biosynthesis of hypochlorous acid (HClO) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and chloride ion. This reaction is mediated by myeloperoxidase (MPO) (9Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The neutrophil is the major tissue in which this oxidase is distributed. HClO is a strong oxidant and kills phagocytosed bacteria. Taurine in the neutrophil seems to help protect this tissue against HClO, because taurine instantaneously reacts with HClO and forms taurine chloramine (TauCl) that is by far less toxic than HClO to the neutrophil (10Stapleton P.P. O'Flaherty L. Redmond H, P. Bouchier-Hayes D.J. J. Parenter. Enteral. Nutr. 1998; 22: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the further biological activity of TauCl has been left unclear. Recently, it has been shown that TauCl inhibits production of inflammatory cytokines (11Marcinkiewicz J. Grabowska A. Bereta J. Bryniarski K. Nowak B. Immunopharmacology. 1998; 40: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Kontny E. Szczepa&nacute;ska K. Kowalczewski J. Kurowska M. Janicka I. Marcinkiewicz J. Maśliński W. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because gene expressions of inflammatory cytokines are known to be regulated by NF-κB (7Lloyd A.R. Oppenheim J.J. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 169-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 8Cassatella M.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 21-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), one assumes that TauCl inhibits NF-κB activation. However, the molecular mechanism of this inhibition is unknown. The results in this study show that one molecular mechanism underlying TauCl-induced inhibition of NF-κB activation is oxidization of IκBα at Met45. It has also been shown that intracellular taurine decreases NF-κB-dependent interleukin-8 (IL-8) production stimulated by bacteria in rat neutrophils. Therefore, the biological function of taurine in the neutrophil is not only reduction of the cytotoxicity of HClO but also mitigation of excessive inflammatory reaction. We assume that taurine may act as an intermediate regulator between two distinct events in neutrophils during their phagocytosis of bacteria, synthesis of HClO, and NF-κB activation. Human acute T cell leukemia Jurkat T and HEK293 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). These three kinds of cells were routinely maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 and passed to new culture at a split ratio of 1:10 every week. The composition of culture medium for Jurkat cells was RPMI 1640 (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The medium pH was adjusted to 7.3 with sodium bicarbonate (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). The culture medium for HL-60 cells was made by supplementing one for Jurkat cells with 2 mm glutamine (Kanto Chemical). A culture medium for HEK293 cells was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 6 mm glutamine. The pH of this medium was also adjusted to 7.3 with sodium bicarbonate. TauCl was freshly prepared by adding equimolar NaOCl (Kanto) dropwise to 5 ml of 80 mmtaurine (Kanto) in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.3) before use, as described previously (13Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Each preparation of TauCl was monitored by ultraviolet absorption spectra (200–300 nm) to confirm the production of monochloramine as well as the absence of dichloramine or unreacted NaOCl. The concentration of TauCl was determined using the molar extinction coefficient (ε252 nm = 415m−1 cm−1). Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (14Aoki T. Sano Y. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1159-1164PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were boiled and fractionated by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). To detect a small change in the molecular weight of IκB like its molecular weight increase due to phosphorylation, we used a large gel consisting of ∼10 cm separating gel and overran until IκB came close to the bottom of the gel (14Aoki T. Sano Y. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1159-1164PubMed Google Scholar). In most experiments, the primary and secondary antibodies used were rabbit anti-IκBα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. When mouse anti-FLAG antibody was used as a primary antibody, the secondary antibody was rabbit anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Proteins on the membrane were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescent method with a kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline without Mg2+ or Ca2+ (PBS(−)), and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (15Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Inoue J. Kerr L.D. Kakizuka A. Verma I.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 1109-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide probe containing the sequence of NF-κB binding site (sense, 5′-agcttCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGG-3′; antisense, 5′-tcgaCCTCTCGGAAAGTCCCCTCTGa-3′) labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) by T4 oligonucleotide kinase (Takara Biomedical, Shiga, Japan) was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature. The NF-κB bound to the labeled oligonucleotide probe was fractionated on 4% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. A reporter gene consisted of a plasmid containing the luciferase gene in the downstream of three binding sites of NF-κB (3×κB-tk-luc) or five binding sites of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (5×CRE-tk-luc). A plasmid containing β-galactosidase gene, which has a β actin promoter (pA5cβgal) was co-transfected to estimate the transfection efficiency. Jurkat cells (2 × 106) were transfected with 1 μg of a reporter gene and 0.5 μg of pA5cβgal by the DEAE-dextran method. Cells were cultured for 2 days after transfection, treated with 1 mm TauCl for 1 h, and stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNFα for 1.5 h. HEK293 cells (3 ×105) seeded a day before were co-transfected with 0.1 μg of 3×κB-tk-luc and 5 μg of pRcβact-3HAIKKβ by the calcium phosphate method. Cells were cultured for 2 days and treated with 1 mm TauCl for 1 h. Luciferase activity in the cells was measured with the PicaGene Luminescence kit (Wako, Tokyo, Japan). For determining the β-galactosidase activity, 50 μl of each cell lysate was diluted with 450 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and mixed with 100 μl of a substrate solution. The composition of this solution was 2 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). When the mixture turned yellow after a certain incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 500 μl of 1 mNa2CO3. The β-galactosidase activity was spectrophotometrically determined at 430 nm. Because the transfection efficiency estimated by β-galactosidase activity did not widely deviate, luciferase activity was not normalized with the transfection efficiency. After Jurkat cells (8 × 106) were treated with TauCl and TNFα, cell lysate was made as described previously (17DiDonato J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 393-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was cleaned by a 1-h incubation with 2 μg of normal rabbit serum and 30 μg of a 50:50 (v/v) slurry of Protein G-Sepharose beads and centrifuged again at 2,000 × g for 1 min. An anti-IKKβ (1.5 μg) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the resultant supernatant. Then 20 μl of the 50:50 (v/v) slurry of Protein G-Sepharose beads was added again. The mixture was rotated for 1 h and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 1 min. The final pellet was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 3 μg of IκBα in the presence of 20 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. IκBα was fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and phosphorylation was detected by imaging analysis with BAS 3000 (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Deletion mutants of IκBα were prepared by a PCR method. All PCR products of IκBα cDNA fragments were verified by nucleotide sequencing. To subclone IκBα deletion mutants, pGEX (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Their overproduction as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins was carried out with Escherichia coli BL21 strain (Promega, Madison, WI). IκBα-glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IκBα mutants were released from glutathione S-transferase by digestion with thrombin protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and concentrated using Centricon (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). A point mutation of IκBα whose Met45 was converted to alanine (IκBα M45A) was made by site-directed mutagenesis using a method previously described by Kunkel et al. (18Kunkel T.A. Bebebek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). A wild type deletion mutant consisting of the amino acids 1–280 (IκBα 1–280 (wild type)) and a corresponding point-mutated IκBα (IκBα 1–280 (M45A)) were prepared by PCR as described above. A vector pME was used to express wild type and mutants of IκBα in Jurkat cells (14Aoki T. Sano Y. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1159-1164PubMed Google Scholar). A peptide fragment consisting of IκBα 43–50 was synthesized as one with acetylated N-terminal end (Ac-EQMLKELQ). This peptide fragment at 1 mm was incubated with 400 μm TauCl for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction solution was separated by HPLC with an octadodecyl sulfate C18 column (Senshu Scientific Co., Tokyo, Japan). The separation run was recorded with a UV detector set at 215 nm. Solvents A and B were water and acetonitrile, respectively. Both solvents contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Solvent A was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a gradient of solvent B from 5 to 25% in 20 min and maintained for an additional 5 min at 25% of solvent B. Peaks fractionated by HPLC were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry for the molecular weight determination of AcEQMLKELQ. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (Aldrich) was used as a matrix. Cells (3 × 106) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) were homogenized for 10 s three times with 5-s intervals using a Polytron-type homogenizer. The MPO activity was determined usingo-dianisidine (Sigma) as a substrate (19Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The concentration of protein in the cell homogenates was determined by the Lowry method (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107) were rinsed twice with PBS(−) to remove extracellular taurine and digested with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Cell debris was removed by a centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 5 min. The amount of taurine in the supernatant was determined by an amino acid analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The cell volume (1 × 107 cells) was estimated by subtracting freeze-dried weight from wet weight. The intracellular concentration of taurine was obtained by dividing the amount of intracellular taurine by the cell volume. Sprague-Dawley male rats (10 weeks old) were intraperitoneally administered with 40 ml of 1% casein (Wako) in PBS(−). Eighteen hours later, neutrophils were collected from the abdominal cavity by washing with PBS(−). Collected neutrophils were rinsed twice with PBS(−), resuspended, and incubated for 30 min in a hypotonic buffer to reduce intracellular taurine. The composition of hypotonic buffer was 95 mm KCl, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.3, whose osmolarity was 198 ± 1 mosm·kg−1 (n = 3). To reload taurine, cells whose taurine content was reduced were incubated for 30 min with a hypertonic buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mmMgCl2 containing 100 mm taurine, buffered with 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.3, 416 ± 4 mosm·kg−1 (n = 6)). Taurine was replaced with raffinose in the hypertonic buffer for cells whose taurine content was kept low. Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), whose pH was adjusted to 7.3 with 5 mm sodium bicarbonate. An aliquot of neutrophil suspension (200 μl of 1 × 106 cells/ml) was mixed with the same volume of E. coli K88 suspension (200 μl of 1 × 107 cells/ml) to initiate phagocytosis. Therefore, the multiplicity of infection was 10. After incubation for the desired time, neutrophils and bacteria were precipitated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was used to determine IL-8 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the rat GRO/CINC-1 detection kit (AmershamBiosciences). A proteasome inhibitor (PSI), Z-Ile-Glu (OtBu)-Ala-Leu-CHO, was obtained from Bachem (Budendorf, Switzerland). Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and ionomycin were purchased from Sigma. 4-Aminobenzoic hydrazide (ABAH) was from Aldrich. Alkaline phosphatase (calf intestine) was purchased from Takara. All other reagents used were analytical grade. To investigate the effect of TauCl on NF-κB activation, we paid attention to IκBα, which is a key protein in the cascade of NF-κB activation. We used the Jurkat T cell line, because this cell line was one of the most characterized cell lines with regard to molecular mechanisms of NF-κB activation. Western blot analysis of IκBα was performed for 15 min after stimulation with 20 ng/ml TNFα. When the cells were stimulated with TNFα, a band shift of IκBα due to its phosphorylation by IKK was observed at 5 min, and both original and shifted bands disappeared at 10 and 15 min (Fig.1 A). Treatment with 1 mm TauCl for 1 h prior to TNFα stimulation brought about two shifted bands of IκBα even at 0 min, but these two shifted and original bands did not disappear for 15 min after TNFα stimulation. Although IκBα also survived for 15 min when cells were pretreated for 1 h with 100 μm PSI and 300 μm PDTC, transient patterns of IκBα after TNFα stimulation were different from that observed in TauCl pretreatment. These results indicate that TauCl pretreatment increased resistance of IκBα to degradation induced by TNFα. However, TauCl seems to inhibit IκBα degradation differently from PSI or PDTC. We studied the effect of TauCl on IκBβ. Jurkat cells were stimulated with a combination of PMA and ionomycin to initiate the degradation of IκBα and IκBβ at one time (Fig.1 B, Control). IκBα and IκBβ disappeared for 30 min and 2 h after stimulation, respectively. When cells were pretreated with 1 mm TauCl for 1 h, IκBβ degraded, whereas IκBα did not. The results indicate that the modification of IκB by TauCl is specific to α isoform. To examine if TauCl-induced inhibition of IκBα degradation leads to interruption of nuclear transfer of NF-κB, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed. After TNFα stimulation, the amount of NF-κB translocated into the nucleus increased for 30 min (Fig. 1 C). However, a 1-h pretreatment with 1 mmTauCl drastically decreased NF-κB translocation into the nucleus. We performed a reporter assay to reveal that TauCl inhibits NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Luciferase activity in cells transfected with 3×κB-tk-luc was decreased by TauCl in a dose-dependent manner, while no effects of TauCl on luciferase transcription were observed in cells transfected with 5×CRE-tk-luc (Fig. 1 D). These results indicate that inhibition of IκBα degradation by TauCl leads to inhibition of nuclear transfer of NF-κB and subsequent NF-κB-dependent transcription. We examined effects of TauCl treatment on IKK activity and NF-κB activation triggered by overexpression of IKKβ. IκBα was phosphorylated by in vitro incubation with IKK immunoprecipitated from Jurkat cells stimulated with TNFα (Fig.2 A). A similar phosphorylation was observed, although IKK was extracted from cells treated with 1 mm TauCl for 1 h prior to TNFα stimulation. This means that TauCl does not inhibit either the signal pathway upstream of IKK activation triggered by TNFα stimulation or IKK itself. When IKKβ was overexpressed in HEK293 cells, NF-κB was activated, and luciferase expression was increased by ∼30-fold (Fig. 2 B). TauCl treatment inhibited two-thirds of this increase of NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression. The results indicate that TauCl interacts with the signal pathway downstream rather than upstream of IKK activation. Because TauCl treatment caused a band shift of IκBα similar in molecular size to that of phosphorylated IκBα at Ser32/Ser36, we assumed that TauCl might modify IκBα at these serine residues. A FLAG-tagged IκBα mutant whose Ser32/Ser36 are converted to alanine (FLAG-IκBα (S32A/S36A)) was overexpressed in Jurkat cells, treated with 1 mm TauCl for 1 h, and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody revealed that TauCl treatment induced band shift of FLAG-IκBα (S32A/S36A), indicating that modification of IκBα by TauCl does not occur at Ser32/Ser36 (Fig.3 A). To examine whether TauCl-induced band shift is due to phosphorylation, cell extracts were treated for 30 min with 10 units of alkaline phosphatase before electrophoresis. Alkaline phosphatase treatment dephosphorylated IκBα that had been phosphorylated at Ser32/Ser36 by IKK activated by TNFα (Fig.3 B). However, a similar alkaline phosphatase treatment of the extract from cells pretreated for 1 h with 1 mmTauCl did not affect shifted bands of IκBα, showing that phosphorylation is not a cause of TauCl-induced IκBα band shift. Cell extracts were first boiled for 5 min to inactivate enzymes and then treated for 30 min with TauCl in the range of 0–0.4 mm. Boiling reduced the sensitivity of IκBα to TauCl, but TauCl still generated the band shift (Fig. 3 C). This experiment suggests that any enzymatic reaction may not be involved in band shift formation of IκBα by TauCl. The modification site of IκBα by TauCl was investigated to gain insight into molecular mechanisms of TauCl-mediated inhibition of IκBα degradation. Two deletion mutants of IκBα 43–180 and 47–180 synthesized in bacteria were treated with 400 μm TauClin vitro and fractionated on 12.5% polyacrylamide/SDS gel. The deletion mutant of IκBα 47–180 did not show its band shift upon TauCl treatment, although band shift was observed with wild type IκBα 1–317 and the other mutant of IκBα 43–180 (Fig.4 A). We speculated that one of the TauCl modification sites exists in the region of amino acid residues 43–46 of IκBα. Therefore, we made three more deletion mutants of IκBα 44–180, 45–180, and 46–180 and repeated a similar TauCl treatment experiment. Mutants of IκBα 44–180 and 45–180 exhibited band shift, whereas IκBα 46–180 did not (Fig.4 B). We assumed that a TauCl modification site might be Met45 of IκBα. A small peptide of IκBα 43–50 with acetylated N-terminal end, Ac-EQMLKELQ, was used to understand how IκBα Met45 is modified by TauCl. The chromatogram of this peptide showed a major peak at the retention time of 22 min (Fig.5 A, Control). This was designated as the intact peptide peak. A small peak at 2 min was due to phosphate in a buffer. Treatment of the peptide for 30 min with 400 μm TauCl resulted in the appearance of another peak at 15 min with decreasing the intact peptide peak (Fig. 5 A,TauCl). This means that TauCl treatment increases the hydrophilicity of the peptide. For further analysis, the intact peptide peak at 22 min and another peak at 15 min generated by TauCl treatment were collected and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. TauCl treatment increased the molecular weight of the peptide by a factor of ∼16 (Fig. 5 B). Because the increased molecular weight of 16 is equal to that of one oxygen atom, the modification of the peptide by TauCl is estimated to be oxidation of IκBα Met45 to methionine sulfoxide. Other small peaks usually observed in this type of mass spectrometry are ghosts. To confirm that Met45 of IκBα is an amino acid residue that is modified by TauCl, Western blot analysis was performed with Jurkat cells transfected with pME-IκBα 1–280 (M45A). For control, pME-IκBα 1–280 (wild type) was used. These deletion mutants were used to distinguish mutant IκBα from endogenous full-length IκBα. When cells expressing IκBα 1–280 (wild type) and (M45A) were stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNFα, these IκBαs degraded for 20 min (Fig.6 A). Upon 1-h pretreatment with 2 mm TauCl, two shifted bands of IκBα 1–280 (wild type) were generated. Either shifted or original band did not degrade like endogenous full-length wild type IκBα. However, IκBα 1–280 (M45A) was degraded by TNFα stimulation regardless of a similar treatment with TauCl. Using 3×κB-tk-luc, reporter assay was performed in Jurkat cells transfected with pME-IκBα 1–280 (wild type and M45A). Treatment with 2 mm TauCl for 1 h inhibited TNFα-induced luciferase activity by a factor of 90% in cells expressing IκBα 1–280 (wild type) (Fig. 6 B). In cells expressing IκBα 1–280 (M45A), inhibition by TauCl was less (70%), although not completely reversed. To evaluate expression levels of IκBα 1–280 (wild type) and (M45A), a Western blot was performed. Band densities were less than that of endogenous IκBα (Fig. 6 C). The low level of expression of IκBα (M45A) relative to endogenous IκBα may account for failure in full recovery of luciferase expression in cells transfected with pME-IκBα 1–280 (M45A). Because HL-60 cells express MPO (21Åbrink M. Gobl A.E. Huang R. Nilsson K. Hellman L. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 1579-1584PubMed Google Scholar), HL-60 cells were used to determine whether TauCl that is intracellularly synthesized modifies IκBα like TauCl that is extracellularly administered. The intracellular concentration of taurine and the activity of MPO were compared between Jurkat and HL-60 cells. The intracellular concentration of taurine was ∼1.0 and 0.8 mm in Jurkat and HL-60 cells, respectively (Fig.7 A). Whereas the MPO activity was none in Jurkat cells, that activity was ∼8 units/mg of protein in HL-60 cells. When HL-60 cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNFα, IκBα was degraded for 10 min after the stimulation (Fig. 7 B). However, when HL-60 cells were pretreated with 100 μmH2O2 for 5 min prior to TNFα stimulation, two band shifts of IκBα were generated, and they did not degrade for 10 min. Furthermore, when HL-60 cells were pretreated for 30 min with a specific MPO inhibitor, ABAH, at 500 μm and treated with H2O2 in the presence of this inhibitor at the same concentration, the band shift of IκBα was not generated, and IκBα degraded in response to TNFα stimulation. In Jurkat cells, IκBα degraded upon TNFα stimulation, regardless of H2O2 or ABAH pretreatment. These results indicate that TauCl is synthesized by MPO in HL-60 cells treated with H2O2, and intracellularly synthesized TauCl can modify IκBα as observed in Jurkat cells extracellularly administered TauCl. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with HL-60 cells. NF-κB translocated into the nucleus when the cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNFα for 15 min. However, the nuclear transfer of NF-κB was decreased by treatment for 5 min with 100 μmH2O2 but recovered by the 30-min pretreatment and presence of 500 μm ABAH during TNFα stimulation. This suggests that IκBα modified by intracellularly synthesized TauCl inhibits NF-κB nuclear translocation. To demonstrate that intracellular taurine really affects the NF-κB-dependent production of inflammatory cytokine, the release of IL-8 was measured with rat neutrophils. As shown in Fig. 8, the release of IL-8 initiated by bacteria was significantly higher in taurine-reduced neutrophils (1 ± 1 mm,n = 11) than reloaded ones (26 ± 9 mm, n = 11) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, when taurine-reloaded neutrophils were treated with 500 μm ABAH before and during incubation with bacteria, the release of IL-8 was significantly increased for 3–7 h (p < 0.05). Because neutrophils express MPO, intracellular taurine reacts"

Transcriptional activation by the DNA-bound AR is accomplished with the help of a variety of coactivator proteins.

The current study tested whether CARM1 can cooperate with other types of coactivator proteins. Recently it was shown that β-catenin can also bind directly to and serve as a coactivator for AR. Here it is shown that CARM1 binds to β-catenin and can function in synergy with β-catenin and p300 as coactivators for AR. The methyltransferase activity of CARM1 is important for its synergistic coactivator function with β-catenin.

Wingless androgen receptor coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase CREB-binding protein dihydrotestosterone glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein hemagglutinin epitope tag lymphoid enhancer factor luciferase mouse mammary tumor virus T-cell factor β-catenin is a critical component of at least two signaling pathways, one that regulates cell-cell adhesion and organization of the actin cytoskeleton, and another that mediates Wnt/Wingless (Wg)1 signaling (1Hecht A. Kemler R. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 3Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). β-catenin protein levels are usually maintained at a low level through active degradation. The glycogen synthase kinase complex constitutively phosphorylates β-catenin, targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation by proteasomes. Activation of the Wnt/Wg pathway leads to inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase activity and thus stabilizes β-catenin protein. As its level increases some β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus, where it binds to and enhances transcriptional activation by at least two different classes of enhancer element-binding transcriptional activator proteins: the lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor (LEF/TCF) proteins (4Liu T.

Thus, at the distal end of the Wnt/Wg and nuclear receptor signaling pathways β-catenin can act as a transcriptional coactivator protein. Transcriptional coactivators are a diverse group of proteins that are recruited to a specific promoter by interaction with specific enhancer-binding proteins (2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 8Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P.

Coactivators participate in chromatin remodeling and recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter. Many coactivators function as complexes, in which one component (hereafter, a primary coactivator) anchors the complex to the enhancer-binding protein, while other components (hereafter, secondary coactivators) mediate the transcriptional activation process (10Chen D., Ma, H.

In addition, β-catenin also recruits and acts synergistically as a coactivator with p300 or CBP (2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 12Sun Y.

These two related proteins acetylate histones and interact with components of the basal transcription machinery, such as TFIIB and the TATA-box binding protein, a component of TFIID that helps to recruit RNA polymerase (15Korzus E.

Huber O. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18017-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To explore further the mechanism of coactivator function by β-catenin, we tested whether β-catenin can cooperate with another type of coactivator protein, the protein methyltransferase CARM1. CARM1 acts as a secondary coactivator for nuclear receptors, including steroid receptors such as AR (10Chen D., Ma, H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). CARM1 is recruited to the promoter through its association with primary coactivators called p160 coactivators, which include GRIP1, steroid receptor coactivator-1, and activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptors. GRIP1, CARM1, and p300 or CBP can form a ternary complex, and these three coactivators function synergistically to enhance the activity of nuclear receptors (19Chen D. Huang S.-M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations that eliminated the methyltransferase activity of CARM1 also severely compromised the ability of CARM1 to cooperate with GRIP1 as coactivators for nuclear receptors (10Chen D., Ma, H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 20Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). CARM1 methylates specific arginine residues in the N-terminal tail of histone H3 in vitro (21Schurter B.T. Koh S.S.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that methylation of the same arginine residue of histone H3 also occurs in vivo at specific promoters as part of the transcriptional activation process (22Ma H. Baumann C.T., Li, H. Strahl B.D. Rice R. Jelinek M.A. Aswad D.W. Allis C.D. Hager G.L. Stallcup M.R. Curr.

These results suggest that histone methylation may cooperate with histone acetylation in chromatin remodeling. In the current study we found a highly synergistic cooperation between CARM1 and β-catenin as coactivators for two different classes of enhancer-binding proteins. To investigate the mechanism of this synergy, we also tested the role of the methyltransferase activity of CARM1, whether CARM1 and β-catenin form a complex in vivo, and whether p300 can further contribute to the synergy between CARM1 and β-catenin. Our results further elucidate the mechanism of coactivator function by β-catenin and indicate that the coactivator role of CARM1 extends beyond its currently known cooperation with the p160 coactivators and nuclear receptors.

Where indicated, 20 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was added after transfection to activate AR. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was determined. Luciferase activity is shown as the mean and standard deviation from four transfected cultures. Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection with a β-galactosidase vector controlled by a Rous sarcoma virus promoter. However, because some of the coactivators used also enhance expression of this vector, the luciferase activity was not normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. Instead, multiple independent experiments were used to confirm results. Binding of wild type or mutant CARM1, translated in vitro as 35S-labeled proteins, to the C-terminal region of GRIP1 fused to glutathioneS-transferase were performed as described previously (30Koh S.S.

For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, COS-7 cells (28Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106 per 100-mm culture dish and transfected with Targefect F-2 reagent (Targeting Systems) using 5 μg of each expression plasmid. After 48 h of growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were harvested with 1.0 ml of RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Cell lysate (0.45 ml) was incubated on a rotator with rabbit anti-β-catenin IgG or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml for 12–16 h at 4 °C. After addition of 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the incubation was continued for 2 h. The immune complex was collected and washed three times by centrifugation with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot (31Ding X.F. Anderson C.M., Ma, H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 0.1 μg/ml rat monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope as primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as secondary antibody. β-catenin was previously shown to bind to and enhance transcriptional activation by AR (6Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar). CARM1 binds to p160 coactivators, which target the coactivator complex to activated nuclear receptors (10Chen D., Ma, H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Because both β-catenin and CARM1 can function as coactivators with nuclear receptors, we tested their ability to cooperate as coactivators. Activation of the Wnt/Wg signaling pathway normally results in stabilization of β-catenin protein and thus increased cellular levels of β-catenin. An alternative method for increasing β-catenin protein levels is by exogenous expression from a β-catenin expression vector (2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of CV-1 cells with a luciferase reporter gene controlled by the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTV-LUC) and an expression vector encoding AR led to expression of luciferase, which depended on the presence of DHT, the activating hormone for AR (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 9). In the presence of DHT co-expression of β-catenin enhanced reporter gene activity about 2-fold (lane 2), and co-expression of CARM1 with AR also modestly enhanced luciferase activity (lanes 6–8). When added together, CARM1 and β-catenin enhanced luciferase activity up to 33-fold (lanes 3–5) compared with AR alone (lane 1). The synergistic effect of β-catenin and CARM1 was completely dependent on the presence of DHT (lanes 9–12), demonstrating that they were not directly or non-specifically activating the reporter gene but were acting as coactivators for the hormone-activated AR. CARM1 is an arginine-specific protein methyltransferase that can methylate histone H3 in vitro(10Chen D., Ma, H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 21Schurter B.T. Koh S.S. Chen D. Bunick G.J. Harp J.M. Hanson L. Henschen-Edman A. Mackay D.R. Stallcup M.R. Aswad D.W. Biochem. 2001; 40: 5747-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and in vivo (22Ma H. Baumann C.T., Li, H. Strahl B.D. Rice R. Jelinek M.A. Aswad D.W. Allis C.D. Hager G.L. Stallcup M.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1981-1985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Substitution of a CARM1 mutant lacking histone H3 methyltransferase activity for wild type CARM1 in the transient transfection assays resulted in a substantial reduction in the ability of CARM1 to function synergistically as a coactivator with β-catenin (Fig. 2 A). Mutant and wild type proteins were expressed at similar levels (20Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mutant and wild type CARM1 proteins bound equallyin vitro to the C-terminal region of GRIP1 (Fig.2 B), indicating the structural integrity of the mutant CARM1 protein. Thus, the reduction in coactivator activity observed with the CARM1 mutant indicates that the methyltransferase activity of CARM1 plays an important role in its coactivator function; however, part of the coactivator function was independent of the methyltransferase activity, indicating that CARM1 enhances AR function by additional mechanisms, such as protein-protein interaction with the transcription machinery. To explore the mechanism of synergy between β-catenin and CARM1, we tested whether these two proteins can form a complex in vivo. When HA-tagged CARM1 and HA-tagged β-catenin were co-expressed in COS-7 cells, both proteins were detected by immunoblot using antibodies against the HA epitope (Fig.3, lane 1). Antiserum against β-catenin precipitated a large amount of β-catenin and a small amount of CARM1 (lane 3), whereas normal rabbit IgG failed to precipitate either protein (lane 2). Both wild type CARM1 (top panel) and the methyltransferase-deficient mutant of CARM1 (bottom panel) interacted with β-catenin, and results of six independent co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that there was no appreciable difference in the interaction of wild type and mutant CARM1 with β-catenin. Because β-catenin can bind directly to AR and CARM1 can bind to β-catenin in vivo, β-catenin may recruit CARM1 to hormone-activated AR bound to its target promoters. The related histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP have been shown previously to cooperate with β-catenin as coactivators (2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 12Sun Y. Kolligs F.T. Hottiger M.O. Mosavin R. Fearon E.R. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). With nuclear receptors, CARM1 and p300 have also been shown to act synergistically as secondary coactivators in cooperation with the primary p160 coactivators (19Chen D. Huang S.-M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,20Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We thus tested for synergistic cooperation among β-catenin, CARM1, and p300. Our previous studies demonstrated that use of low levels of nuclear receptor expression vectors was conducive for observing synergy among three different coactivators (20Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 30Koh S.S. Chen D. Lee Y.-H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, none of the three coactivators individually caused a significant enhancement of reporter gene activation by AR (Fig.4). Co-expression of p300 or CARM1 with β-catenin also had little or no effect. However, co-expression of all three coactivators together caused a 7-fold enhancement of AR activity. Thus, as demonstrated for primary p160 coactivators (19Chen D. Huang S.-M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), the primary coactivator function of β-catenin may involve recruitment of secondary coactivators such as CARM1 and p300 or CBP. β-catenin serves as a coactivator for the LEF/TCF family of enhancer-binding proteins as well as AR (4Liu T. DeCostanzo A.J. Liu X. Wang H. Hallagan S. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Science. 2001; 292: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 5Billin A.N. Thirlwell H. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6882-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). After observing the synergistic coactivator function of CARM1 and β-catenin with AR, we tested whether these two coactivators could also cooperate to enhance transcriptional activation by LEF-1/TCF-4. By immunoblot, we determined that CV-1 cells contain endogenous TCF-4 (data not shown). When luciferase reporter gene pGL3-OT, which contains three tandem wild type TCF-4 binding elements, was transiently transfected into CV-1 cells, a low level of luciferase activity was observed (Fig. 5, lane 1). This activity was enhanced 16-fold by co-expression of β-catenin (lane 2), and a further enhancement up to 130-fold was observed when CARM1 was co-expressed with β-catenin (lanes 3–5). However, CARM1 alone failed to enhance the reporter gene activity (lanes 6–8). When reporter gene pGL3-OF, which contains mutant TCF-4 binding elements, was compared with pGL3-OT, co-expression of β-catenin and CARM1 caused a modest enhancement of pGL3-OF activity of up to 4-fold (lanes 9–13) as opposed to their enhancement up to 130-fold of pGL3-OT activity (lanes 1–5). Thus, the ability of β-catenin and CARM1 to enhance reporter gene activity depended on the recruitment of the enhancer binding protein, TCF-4, to the promoter. β-catenin was previously shown to function as a coactivator for enhancer-binding proteins from two different protein families: AR (6Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar) and LEF-1/TCF-4 (4Liu T. DeCostanzo A.J. Liu X. Wang H. Hallagan S. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Science. 2001; 292: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 5Billin A.N. Thirlwell H. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6882-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). β-catenin binds directly to AR and TCF-4, and over-expression of β-catenin alone enhances the ability of these enhancer-binding proteins to activate transcription of their target genes. Thus, β-catenin acts as a primary coactivator and presumably helps to activate transcription by recruiting secondary coactivators, which remodel chromatin and/or recruit and activate RNA polymerase II. The fact that β-catenin binds p300 and CBP (2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 12Sun Y. Kolligs F.T. Hottiger M.O. Mosavin R. Fearon E.R.

The current study showed that CARM1 can also bind to β-catenin and cooperate with β-catenin and p300 to enhance the ability of enhancer binding proteins to activate transcription of their target genes. These findings suggest that CARM1 is another part of the mechanism for activation of transcription employed by β-catenin. That CARM1 is acting as a coactivator was shown by its inability to enhance reporter gene function unless the activated enhancer-binding protein was present and unless the promoter of the reporter gene contained binding sites for the enhancer-binding protein. That CARM1 is acting as a secondary coactivator was shown by its inability to enhance reporter gene activity unless the primary coactivator, in this case β-catenin, was present to recruit CARM1 to the promoter. The E267Q mutation in CARM1 eliminated the methyltransferase activity (20Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and dramatically reduced the coactivator function of CARM1 with β-catenin (Fig. 2 A); however, the mutation did not affect the expression of CARM1 (20Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) or the binding of CARM1 to the C-terminal domain of GRIP1 (Fig. 2 B) or to β-catenin (Fig. 3). The selective elimination of methyltransferase activity in this mutant allows us to conclude that the methyltransferase activity was important for the full coactivator function of CARM1 with β-catenin. Histone H3 is a good substrate for CARM1 in vitro and is a target of CARM1 methylation during gene activation in vivo (10Chen D., Ma, H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 21Schurter B.T. Koh S.S. Chen D. Bunick G.J. Harp J.M. Hanson L. Henschen-Edman A. Mackay D.R. Stallcup M.R.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1981-1985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, other proteins may be methylated in addition to or instead of histone H3 when CARM1 is recruited to some promoters. The fact that the elimination of the methyltransferase activity of CARM1 reduced but did not eliminate the coactivator function of CARM1 indicates that CARM1 uses another mechanism, in addition to protein methylation, to transmit the activating signal to the transcription machinery. Other domains of CARM1 may contribute to transcriptional activation through protein-protein interactions with components of the transcription machinery. By analogy, when CBP and p300 act as coactivators, they also use protein-protein interactions as well as their protein acetyltransferase activity to transmit the activating signal (15Korzus E.

CARM1 was previously shown to function as a secondary coactivator for nuclear receptors by cooperating with p160 primary coactivators (10Chen D., Ma, H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar,19Chen D. Huang S.-M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The current study broadens the scope of the potential coactivator function of CARM1 in the cell: CARM1 can function as a coactivator for another class of enhancer-binding protein, TCF-4; and CARM1 can function in cooperation with a different class of primary coactivator, β-catenin. In future work it will be important to test even more broadly for combinatorial functional interactions of CARM1 with other types of coactivators and enhancer-binding proteins. While we have shown here that β-catenin, CARM1, and p300 can function synergistically as coactivators for AR (Fig. 4), we have shown previously that p160 coactivators (such as GRIP1 and steroid receptor coactivator-1), CARM1, and p300 can also function synergistically as coactivators for AR and other nuclear receptors (20Lee Y.-H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Both p160 coactivators and β-catenin bind directly to AR and can thereby recruit their respective coactivator complexes to the promoter. Which of these coactivator complexes is used in any given situation presumably will depend on the relative cellular levels of p160 coactivator and β-catenin and the activation status of signaling pathways that regulate the activity of β-catenin (1Hecht A. Kemler R. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 3Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) or p160 coactivators (32Lopez G.N. Turck C.W. Schaufele F. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22177-22182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is conceivable that β-catenin and p160 coactivators could form a single coactivator complex with CARM1 and p300, which is more effective in mediating transcriptional activation than either of the ternary complexes mentioned above. Thus, future studies should test for physical interaction and functional synergy between p160 coactivators and β-catenin. The wnt pathway and β-catenin are pivotal for driving growth in many types of cancer and during normal development (2Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 33Barker N. Clevers H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 34Chuong C.M. Chodankar R.

In the growth of epithelial appendages such as prostate glands, mammary glands, hair, and feathers, the androgen and estrogen pathways also have profound effects on new growth. The work presented here sets the stage for further exploration of whether sex hormone-regulated growth is mediated by the β-catenin pathway.

TCC is classified histopathologically into three types: superficial (papillary tumors), confined to the bladder wall (pT1, pTa tumors), and invasive (stages T2–T4). Superficial bladder cancers represent a heterogeneous group of tumors, and about 60% of them will recur after transurethral resection (3Heney N.M. Ahmed S. Flanagar M.J. Frable W. Corder M.P.

Gavillet M. Laurini R. Wahli W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 105-114PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF expression is regulated by many growth factors, environmental factors, and cytokines. A PPARγ-mediated up-regulation of VEGF (mRNA and protein secretion) has been established in human vascular smooth muscle cells (41Yamakawa K. Hosoi M. Koyama H. Tanaka S. Fukumoto S. Morii H. Nishizawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, oxidized low-density lipoproteins (Ox-LDL) up-regulate VEGF expression in macrophages and endothelial cells, at least in part, through the activation of PPARγ (42Inoue M. Itoh H. Tanaka T. Chun T.H. Doi K. Fukunaga Y. Sawada N. Yamshita J. Masatsugu K. Saito T. Sakagushi S. Sone M. Yamahara K.I. Yurugi T. Nakao K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Two of the major oxidized lipid components of Ox-LDL, 9-hydroxy-(S)-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), and 13-hydroxy-(S)-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) have been identified as endogenous activators and ligands of PPARγ (39Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). All of these studies suggest that PPARγ may be an important molecular target for the development of therapeutic inhibitors of angiogenesis in the treatment of cancer. No effect on VEGF expression has been observed in the presence of PPARα and PPARβ agonists. So far, in human cancers, a PPAR-mediated regulation of VEGF expression has never been described. Taking into account the importance of VEGF in the angiogenic process and its prognostic significance in the fate of TCC, the present investigation aimed to study VEGF gene regulation by the three PPAR isotypes (α, β, and γ) in RT4 cells (derived from grade I tumor) and T24 cells (derived from grade III tumor). Both groups of cells were derived from human bladder cancer and were used to clarify the intracellular signaling mechanisms involved. In this study, we uncovered a differential regulation of VEGF expression by PPARs according to the differentiated state of the cells. This regulated VEGF expression occurs through a transcriptional activation of the VEGF promoter via an indirect mechanism requiring an intermediary protein factor. In addition, the MAP kinase ERK 1/2 pathway modulates this regulation because an inhibition of PPAR-induced VEGF expression was observed only in the presence of PD98059 (MAP kinase/ERK 1/2 inhibitor). The hypolipidemic drug WY 14,643 came from Chemsyn Science Laboratories (Campro Scientific, Veenendaal, The Netherlands). L-165041, LG10068, and BRL 49653 compounds were a kind gift from Parke Davis. The MAP kinase/ERK 1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 MAP kinase-specific inhibitor SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem(France Biochem, Meudon, France). Cycloheximide, actinomycin D, and wortmannin (specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor activity) were purchased from Sigma (La Verpillère, France). Ligands were dissolved in 100% Me2SO or ethanol and added to cell cultures at a concentration of less than 0.1%. The RT4 and T24 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Biovalley, Conches, France). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in phenol red-free Mc COY's 5a medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1% antibiotic antimycotic mixture (10 mg/ml streptomycin, 10,000 units/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml amphotericin B), 2 mm glutamine, and 15 mm Hepes (Sigma). The cells were tested for the absence of mycoplasma before the experiments were started. For the VEGF expression studies, cells were grown to 100% confluence to avoid any variation in VEGF expression in Mc COY's 5a medium supplemented with 5% decomplemented fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 15 mm Hepes. Before stimulation, cells were washed three times for 24 h with serum-free Mc COY's 5a medium in order to prevent any remaining serum effect. For stimulation with the PPAR ligands (WY 14,643 or L-165041 or BRL 49653) and RXR ligand LG10068, cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free Mc COY's 5a medium. In the inhibitory experiments of protein synthesis and cellular signaling pathways, confluent cells were incubated for 24 h with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1 or 20 μm PD98059, 100 nmwortmannin, or 10 μm SB203580 alone or in the presence of PPAR agonists. The VEGF mRNA expression analysis was then measured by Northern blotting as described below. The pSG5 hPPARα, pBS hPPARβ, and pBS hPPARγ plasmids were a kind gift from L. Michalik (IBA, Lausanne, Switzerland). They were used as positive controls in RT-PCR assays, generating fragments of 125-bp, 100-bp, and 130-bp lengths, respectively, corresponding to the coding region from the A/B domain of each nuclear receptor. The reporter plasmid Cyp2XPal-LUC (26Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) was also a kind gift from L. Michalik. The VEGF promoter-luciferase reporter construct was a kind gift from A. Weisz (Instituto di Patologia generale e Oncologia, Facultà di Medicina e chirurgica, seconda Università di Napoli, Naples, Italy). This pGL2 basic vector contains the human VEGF promoter from −2279 to +56, linked to the firefly luciferase reporter gene (43Minchenko A. Salceda S. Bauer T. Caro J. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 35-39PubMed Google Scholar). The eukaryotic expression vector pSG▵2 containing the NLS LacZ gene from pMMuLV NLS LacZ (NLS LacZ construct) (44Ambrosino C. Cicatiello L. Cobellis G. Addeo R. Sica V. Bresciani F. Weisz A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1472-1483PubMed Google Scholar) was used as an internal control of transfection efficiency and was called hereafter the β-gal plasmid. Total RNA from RT4 and T24 cells was isolated using TRIzolR reagent purchased from Invitrogen. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from human tissues was used as a positive control and was provided by CLONTECH (Saint Quentin Yvelines, France). The synthesis of cDNA was performed in a total volume of 20 μl using 6 μg of total RNA extracted from human liver (positive control for PPARα and PPARγ) and human kidney (positive control for PPARβ) or 1 μg of total RNA extracted from RT4 or T24 cells. The reaction was performed in the presence of 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT) (Invitrogen) and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12–18 (Invitrogen). Subsequent amplifications of the partial cDNA encoding hPPARα, hPPARβ, and hPPARγ were performed using 6 μl of reverse-transcribed mixture, which was one-third diluted as a template with specific oligonucleotide primers, as follows: hPPARα sense, 5′-ACTCTGCCCCCTCTCGCCACTC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GCCAAAGCTTCCAGAACTATCCTC-3′; hPPARβ sense, 5′-GAGCAGCCACAGGAGGAAGCC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GCTGTGGTCCCCCAT-3′; hPPARγ sense, 5′-AGAGATGCCATTCTGGCCCAC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GTGGAGTAGAAATGCTGGAGA-3′. PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl in the presence of 100 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 200 μm dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 units of Taq DNA recombinant polymerase (Invitrogen). The expected sizes of PCR products for hPPARα, β, and γ were 125, 100, and 130 base pairs, respectively. Negative controls for reverse transcription and PCR amplifications were included. For the plasmid controls, 0.5 μg of plasmid was used. The PCR mixtures were subjected to 30 cycles of amplifications by denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), hybridization (30 s at 60 °C), and elongation (20 s at 72 °C). The PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. Total RNA from confluent cells was isolated using a commercially available kit TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Euromedex, Souffelwyersheim, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The RNA (30 μg) was size-fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe GT Genomic (Bio-Rad) using a vacuum blotting system. The filters were prehybridized for 5 min at 42 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 0.25m NaCl, 7% SDS, and 0.12 mNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2). The hybridizations were performed for 48 h in the same solution at 42 °C with the VEGF cDNA probe (45Chin K. Kurashima Y. Ogura T. Tajiri H. Yoshida S. Esumi H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the random hexamer labeling method (Prime-a-gene labeling system, Promega, Lyon, France). After a rapid wash in 2× SSC solution at room temperature, two washes were performed for 15 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, respectively. The final wash was performed for 15 min at 55 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. To check the loading of equivalent amounts of total RNA and to normalize the experiments, the filters were hybridized with a 1200-bp mouse β-actin probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random hexamer labeling method. The VEGF and β-actin mRNA were quantitated using PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular ImagerR System, GS-505, Bio-Rad). After a serum-free period of 24 h, confluent cells were stimulated for 24 h in the presence of 50 μm WY 14,643 or 25 μm L-165041 or 10 μm BRL 49653 or vehicle. VEGF protein levels in cell-conditioned medium were determined by ELISA, using a human VEGF immunoassay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data are expressed in ng/mg of total cellular proteins and are the mean values of three independent experiments in quadruplicate. The total cellular protein concentration was determined using a protein assay according to the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). To evaluate VEGF mRNA stability in RT4 and T24 cells, we measured the half-life of VEGF mRNA in the cells after 24 h of incubation in the presence of PPAR ligands. The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added to the culture to block further gene transcription. Cells were harvested at 30 min, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h after the addition of actinomycin D. The amount of VEGF and β-actin at each time point was quantified after Northern blotting using phosphorimager analysis; the amount of VEGF mRNA was corrected for loading differences using the amount of β-actin mRNA. For functional studies, T24 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a concentration of 1.5 × 105 cells per well in Mc COY's 5a medium supplemented with 5% delipidated serum. All transient transfections were performed using LipofectinRReagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. A total amount of 4 μg of DNA (2 μg of β-gal plasmid and 2 μg of reporter plasmid) was transfected with Lipofectin reagent (2 μg/μg plasmid DNA). After 24 h, cells were incubated for 12 h in Mc COY's 5a medium supplemented with 5% delipidated serum and then stimulated with test drugs in the absence of serum for 24 h more. Cells were harvested using reporter lysis buffer purchased from Promega. Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The β-galactosidase activity was spectrophotometrically measured using orthonitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. Luciferase activity values were normalized to a β-galactosidase activity content, and -fold activation was calculated. Each experiment, subjected to a statistical analysis, was performed independently at least three times with similar results. The significance of the data was determined using Student's t test (two-tailed). p < 0.05 was deemed significant. The data presented consist of mean ±S.D. RT-PCR was performed to demonstrate the expression of all three hPPAR (α, β, and γ) mRNAs in RT4 and T24 cells culturedin vitro. Based on the primers used in this study to amplify the cDNA of hPPARα, hPPARβ, and hPPARγ, fragments were expected to be 125, 100, and 130 base pairs in length, respectively. RNA samples from human liver and kidney were used as positive controls as well as plasmids containing the fragments of 125, 100, and 130 bp of hPPARα, hPPARβ, and hPPARγ, respectively. As shown in Fig.1, all three PPAR mRNAs were expressed in both cell lines. Negative controls, performed in the absence of mRNA or directly on mRNA, yielded no detectable band (data not shown). Although the expression of hPPARγ mRNA and protein in T24 cells has been reported previously (46Guan Y.F. Zhang Y.H. Breyer R.M. Davis L. Breyer M.D. Neoplasia. 1999; 1: 330-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this study demonstrates for the first time the expression of hPPARα and hPPARβ mRNAs in RT4 and T24 cells and that of hPPARγ mRNA in RT4 cells. To examine the regulation of VEGF expression in RT4 (derived from grade I tumor) and T24 (derived from grade III tumor) bladder cancer cells, we first investigated the ability of these tumor cells to express the VEGF gene constitutively. Total RNA was extracted from these cells and was subjected to Northern blot analysis. On the Northern blots (Fig. 2,upper panels), three bands at ∼5.2, 4.5, and 1.7 kb were observed with the VEGF-A cDNA probe. Thus, RT4 and T24 cell lines express VEGF-A. The basal VEGF mRNA levels were lower in T24 cells than in RT4 cells. In RT4 cells after the ligand-dependent activation of the three PPAR isotypes (WY 14,643 for PPARα, L-165041 for PPARβ, and BRL 49653 for PPARγ) for 24 h, we observed a significant induced VEGF mRNA expression in each case for each of the VEGF transcripts (Fig. 2). The 5.2-kb transcript level was increased 5.5- and 5.3-fold with WY 14,643 (50 μm) and L-165041 (25 μm), respectively. In the case of the 4.5-kb transcript, PPARα and β agonists increased its expression 5.6- and 6.2-fold, respectively. For the 1.7-kb transcript, PPARα and β ligands stimulated this transcript expression to the same extent with 4.8- and 4.6-fold increases, respectively. The thiazolidinedione BRL 49653, a PPARγ ligand, induced the three VEGF transcripts to a lower extent than the other two ligands, WY 14,643 and L-165041, with 2.7-, 2.7-, and 2.5-fold inductions for the 5.2-, 4.5-, and 1.7-kb transcripts, respectively. These results contrast with the expression of VEGF observed in T24 cells. Indeed, in these cells no effect of PPARα and γ ligands on VEGF expression was observed; only PPARβ regulated the VEGF gene with 2-, 3.6-, and 2.9-fold inductions for the 5.2-, 4.5-, and 1.7-kb transcripts, respectively. In conclusion, in cells derived from grade I bladder cancer, VEGF expression is regulated by PPARα, β, and γ. In contrast, in cells derived from grade III bladder cancer, PPARα and PPARγ-mediated up-regulation of VEGF expression cannot be found despite the presence of receptors in these cells. VEGF expression is induced only by PPARβ. Thus, for the first time we demonstrate a differential up-regulation of the expression of VEGF mRNA by PPAR agonists in bladder cancer cells according to the differentiation state of the cells. To determine whether the up-regulation of VEGF mRNA levels by PPAR ligands correlates with higher VEGF protein levels in RT4- and T24 cell-conditioned media, we treated cells with vehicle alone or with 50 μm WY 14,643, or 25 μm L-165041, or 10 μm BRL 49653 for 24 h. Then, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of RT4 and T24 cell-conditioned media (Fig.3). The amount of VEGF proteins was greater in RT4 cell-conditioned medium than that measured in T24 cell-conditioned medium. We found that the conditioned media of RT4 and T24 control cells (in the presence of vehicle alone) contained 3.7 ± 0.6 and 1.1 ± 0.2 ng/mg total cellular proteins, respectively. The PPAR activators WY 14,643, L-165041, and BRL 49653 significantly increased VEGF protein levels by 2.6-, 3-, and 1.7-fold, respectively, after 24 h stimulation of RT4 cells. In T24 cell-conditioned medium, only the PPARβ activator L-165041 increased VEGF protein levels by 4.4-fold. Thus, the PPAR agonist-dependent increase in VEGF gene expression correlates with increased levels of VEGF protein in the culture medium. To examine the efficacy of a retinoid in potentiating the PPAR ligand effect on VEGF mRNA expression, and thus to confirm the specificity of the effect of PPAR agonists WY 14,643, L-165041, and BRL 49653, we treated cells with 1 μm LG10068, a RXR-selective ligand, alone or in the presence of PPAR ligands. PPARs are known to activate cis-acting elements in the promoters of target genes as heterodimers with RXR (20Kliewer S.A. Umesomo K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, no VEGF transcript was induced by LG10068 alone after 24 h of stimulation. The RXR agonist potentiated the effects of WY 14,643, L-165041, and BRL 49653 for the three VEGF transcripts. This result indicates the involvement of the RXR/PPAR heterodimer complex in the regulation of VEGF expression in RT4 cells. To determine whether PPAR synthetic ligands can increase the stability of VEGF mRNA, cells were left untreated or treated with 50 μm WY 14,643 or 25 μm L-165041 or 10 μm BRL 49653 for 24 h prior to the addition of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Then, the VEGF mRNA half-life was estimated with quantitative Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, in the control cells there was a rapid decay of VE"

https://openalex.org/W2036904418,"We report the cDNA cloning and functional characterization of human cyclin L, a novel cyclin related to the C-type cyclins that are involved in regulation of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription. Cyclin L also contains a COOH-terminal dipeptide repeat of alternating arginines and serines, a hallmark of the SR family of splicing factors. We show that recombinant cyclin L interacts with p110 PITSLRE kinase, and that cyclin L antibody co-immunoprecipitates a kinase activity from HeLa nuclear extracts that phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of pol II and splicing factor SC35, and is inhibited by the cdk inhibitor p21. Cyclin L antibody inhibits the second step of RNA splicing in vitro, and recombinant cyclin L protein stimulates splicing under suboptimal conditions. Significantly, the IC50 for splicing inhibition by p21 is similar to the IC50 for inhibition of the cyclin L-associated kinase activity. Cyclin L and its associated kinase are thus new members of the pre-mRNA processing machinery. We report the cDNA cloning and functional characterization of human cyclin L, a novel cyclin related to the C-type cyclins that are involved in regulation of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription. Cyclin L also contains a COOH-terminal dipeptide repeat of alternating arginines and serines, a hallmark of the SR family of splicing factors. We show that recombinant cyclin L interacts with p110 PITSLRE kinase, and that cyclin L antibody co-immunoprecipitates a kinase activity from HeLa nuclear extracts that phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of pol II and splicing factor SC35, and is inhibited by the cdk inhibitor p21. Cyclin L antibody inhibits the second step of RNA splicing in vitro, and recombinant cyclin L protein stimulates splicing under suboptimal conditions. Significantly, the IC50 for splicing inhibition by p21 is similar to the IC50 for inhibition of the cyclin L-associated kinase activity. Cyclin L and its associated kinase are thus new members of the pre-mRNA processing machinery. cyclin-dependent kinase polymerase II glutathione S-transferase open reading frame monoclonal antibody Cyclins and their partners the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks)1 (reviewed in Refs. 1Martı́n-Castellanos C.

Human cyclin K is homologous to cyclin C, associates with the large subunit of pol II, and its kinase partner, cdk9, phosphorylates the CTD of pol II (14Edwards M.C. Wong C. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the CTD plays a pivotal role in regulating transcription initiation, elongation, and processing of RNA transcripts. It is widely accepted that transcription and RNA processing are linked (reviewed in Ref. 15Riedl T. Egly J. Gene Expr. 2000; 9: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar): capping enzymes, polyadenylation factors, and splicing factors assemble at the CTD, and these interactions are modulated by CTD phosphorylation (reviewed in Refs. 16Corden J.L. Patturajan M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 413-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B.

Extensive research has focused on the role of the CTD in regulating pre-mRNA splicing. The CTD targets splicing factors to transcription sites in vivo (19Misteli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 697-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar); phosphorylated pol II stimulates splicing (20Hirose Y. Tacke R. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and splicing factors associate with pol II through a hyperphosphorylated CTD (21Kim E., Du, L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Splicing factors comprise the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, the spliceosome-associated proteins, and the SR proteins (reviewed in Ref. 22Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). SR proteins constitute a conserved family of pre-mRNA splicing factors that are characterized by an arginine-serine dipeptide repeat within their carboxyl-terminal domain and one or two RNA-binding domains within their amino-terminal domain (23Graveley B. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). SR proteins are essential splicing factors, and are capable of complementing splicing-deficient cellular extracts. Several members of this family have been identified, and among these the human factors ASF/SF2 (24Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 25Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Kozak D. Binns G. Cell. 1991; 66: 383-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and SC35 (26Fu X.-D. Maniatis T. Science. 1992; 256: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) are well characterized. Four additional SR proteins with molecular masses of 30, 40, 55, and 75 kDa have also been identified (27Roth M.B. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). SR proteins are required for early steps in spliceosome assembly and influence selection of splice sites (22Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 26Fu X.-D. Maniatis T. Science. 1992; 256: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,28Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D. Cell. 1990; 62: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In contrast, the SR-related proteins contain an RS repeat but lack RNA-binding domains (reviewed in Ref. 29Blencowe B. Bowman J. McCracken S. Rosonina E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A recent survey of the human, yeast, Drosophila melanogaster, andCaenorhabditis elegans genomes has identified a number of other RS domain proteins. These include proteins involved in 3′-end processing, chromatin-associated proteins, kinases, phosphatases, and a new cyclin, named cyclin L, that was identified in C. elegans and D. melanogaster (30Boucher L. Ouzounis C.A. Enright A.J. Blencowe B.J. RNA. 2001; 7: 1693-1701PubMed Google Scholar), and it is similar to cyclin ania-6 in the mouse (31Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.-P. Lavoie B. Vincent M. Krause M. Hyman S.E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cyclin L is related to the transcriptional cyclin K (14Edwards M.C. Wong C. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and it is the first known example of a cyclin containing an RS domain in addition to a cyclin box. The function of cyclin L is not known although results obtained from immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation experiments show that the mouse homologue, cyclin ania-6a, localizes to nuclear speckle compartments, associates with the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA pol II, the splicing factor SC-35, and the cdk PITSLRE (31Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.-P. Lavoie B. Vincent M. Krause M. Hyman S.E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results suggest a potential role for cyclin L in RNA splicing. We report here the cloning and characterization of the human gene for cyclin L, and show that recombinant human cyclin L interacts with p110 PITSLRE kinase. Moreover, cyclin L is associated with a kinase activity that phosphorylates histone H1, the CTD, and SR protein SC35. This activity is inhibited by low concentrations of the cdk-specific inhibitor p21. An antibody to cyclin L inhibits in vitrosplicing specifically at the second step, and recombinant cyclin L protein stimulates splicing of a β-globin precursor RNA. Furthermore,in vitro splicing is inhibited by p21 with an inhibition profile nearly identical to that of kinase inhibition. These results provide initial evidence that cyclin L is a functional cyclin and directly affects pre-mRNA splicing, although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. Humancyclin L cDNA was generated by PCR using primers designed to match the 5′- and 3′-ends of a contiguous sequence of expressed sequence tags that appeared to encode a novel cyclin. The primers were: sense, 5′-CAGTCTTGTTTCGGGTTCCGGCTGCGTT-3′ and antisense, 5′-AAAAACAAGATTTGTATTTTATTTCCTTGT-3′. These primers were used to amplify the cDNA clone from human lung cDNA (CLONTECH) using a thermostable polymerase mixture (Advantage cDNA polymerase, CLONTECH). The PCR product was excised from a low-melting point agarose gel, and the agarose digested with AgarAce (Promega), cloned into the T-A vector pCR-II-TOPO (Invitrogen, The Netherlands), and sequenced in both directions using an Applied Biosystems 373A sequencer. A membrane containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from eight different human tissues (CLONTECH) was probed with a 738-bp PCR fragment spanning positions 111–849 of the cyclin L cDNA. 20 ng of the PCR fragment was labeled using the High Prime DNA Labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and purified using a Chromaspin-30 column (CLONTECH). The hybridization, stripping, and re-hybridization procedures were as described by the manufacturer, except that the last wash was carried out at 42 °C. The coding sequence of thecyclin L cDNA clone described above was amplified using primers containing an overhanging EcoRI recognition site (upstream primer, 5′-CGTCGGAATTCACGCGTCCGGGCCTCATTCG-3′ and downstream primer, 5′-GTCGGAATTCGGCGCCTGTGCCTGCCATGTC-3′). The PCR product was purified, digested with EcoRI, and cloned into the EcoRI site of pGex2T (Amersham Biosciences). A plasmid containing the correct orientation of the insert as confirmed by sequencing was used for protein expression. Cultures of freshly transformed XL1 Blue cells (Stratagene) were grown to anA 600 of 1.0, induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, incubated for an additional 2 hours, and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were lysed for 45 min in ice-cold TBSE (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin) and lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml). The crude lysate was sonicated, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with washed glutathione-Sepharose beads, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted in 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Pierce). For GST interaction experiments, 4 μg of either GST-cyclin L or GST alone was added to 10-μl aliquots of HeLa nuclear extract (containing 80 μg of total protein) in a total volume of 100 μl in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, these samples were then incubated with 20 μl of packed glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) on a rocker platform at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were prewashed with the buffer listed above containing 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (three washes with 10 volumes each). After incubation, the beads were pelleted and then washed five to six times with 500 μl of buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. This extensive washing was necessary to reduce nonspecific binding. The washed beads were either used directly for kinase assays, or bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer (at 95 °C for 5 min) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (see below). The mouse anti-SR protein (1H4, also known as 1H4G7) monoclonal antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Anti-PITSLRE (C-17), anti-cyclin C (T-19), anti-RB, anti-CBP, anti-pol II (N-20), anti-TFIIH (p89), and anti-cdk6 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibody to recombinant cyclin L (anti-rL) was raised in rabbits against gel-purified GST-cyclin L fusion protein p36 (see below). Purified GST-cyclin L was separated by a preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel alongside a prestained molecular weight marker and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The regions containing the p36 or p70 peptide were cut out and blocked in Blotto (5% dry milk, 160 mm NaCl, 20 mmNaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.2, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at ambient temperature. Serum containing anti-L was incubated separately with each nitrocellulose strip at 4 °C overnight, and the blots were washed for 20 min in 0.15 m NaCl followed by a 20-min wash in phosphate-buffered saline. Bound antibody from each strip was eluted in 400 μl of glycine, pH 2.8, followed by immediate neutralization in 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.3. SDS gels were transferred to Magnagraph nylon membranes in 191 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris base, and 20% methanol using a semi-dry blotting apparatus. Membranes were blocked in Blotto (5% dry milk, 160 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.2, and 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. At the same time, the anti-cyclin L antibody was incubated in Blotto (1:2000) overnight to reduce nonspecific binding. Filters were washed in TBST (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h in antibody/Blotto solution. After washing three times for 10 min in TBST, the filter was incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Bio-Rad) (1:2000). After extensive washing of the membranes, signals were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Protein A-Sepharose was washed three times in A100 buffer (20 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μl of bovine serum albumin (1.5 mg/ml) and 10 μl of antibody (as indicated). The complex was washed as before, and aliquots (1/5 volume) were incubated with 80 μg of HeLa nuclear extract for 1 h at 4 °C. The complexes were washed as before with A100 + 0.1% Nonidet P-40 followed by three washes with A100. The pellets were resuspended in A100 to give a total volume of 120 μl. 60 μl each were added to 10 μl of a kinase reaction containing 20 μm ATP, 1 μl of [α-32P]ATP (150 μCi/μl), 6 mmMgCl2, and the kinase substrate as indicated. The reaction was incubated at ambient temperature for 1 h, precipitated with 25% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and air-dried. Pellets were resuspended in SDS-loading buffer, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to Bio-Max film or quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The precursor RNA used in in vitro splicing assays was transcribed from plasmid SP64Hβδ6 containing a β-globin precursor coding sequence (24Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The plasmid was digested to completion with BamHI, phenol/chloroform extracted, and used in a transcription reaction with SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of 7-methyl-G cap analog and [α-32P]UTP as described by the manufacturer (Promega). The labeled RNA was run on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the gel was briefly exposed to film, and the band corresponding to the full-length RNA was cut from the gel. RNA was eluted from the gel slice in elution buffer (0.3m Na-acetate, pH 5.3, 33% buffer-saturated phenol, 60 μg of glycogen) for 3 h at ambient temperature or overnight at 4 °C (32Yuryev A. Patturajan M. Litingtung Y. Joshi R.V. Gentile C. Gebara M. Corden J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6975-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was purified through an Ultrafree CL filter (Millipore), aliquoted, precipitated separately with ethanol, and stored as dry pellets at −80 °C. Pellets were resuspended in RNase-free H2O at an estimated concentration of 6 ng/μl (or 40 fmol/μl) and 1–2 μl were used in in vitro splicing reactions. Splicing reactions were performed as described (33Reichert V. Moore M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and contained 80 mmpotassium acetate, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm freshly prepared ATP, 1 unit/ml RNasin (Promega), labeled β-globin RNA precursor, 40 μg of HeLa nuclear extract (Promega), or 20 μg HeLa nuclear extract plus 200 ng of GST-cyclin L fusion protein, in a total volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h (or as indicated), stopped with 180 μl of stop buffer (0.5% SDS, 0.3m Na-acetate, pH 5.3, in TE) plus 20 μg of glycogen, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. The reaction products were run on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels with a kinase-labeled 100-bp ladder (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and were visualized by exposure to Bio-Max film and phosphorimage analysis. A 2076-bp human cyclin LcDNA was cloned by PCR from a human lung cDNA library (GenBankTM accession number AF180920). The first methionine codon, at nucleotides 55–57, is in a strong sequence context for an initiation consensus sequence (34Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar), suggesting that this is the correct initiation codon. The ORF encodes a theoretical 59.6-kDa protein, 526 amino acid residues in length, with an isoelectric point of 10.71. A classical polyadenylation signal is located at nucleotide positions 2054–2059. BLAST searches with the predicted amino acid sequence revealed a cyclin box spanning amino acids 48–255 that shares 32% identity and 52% similarity with the cyclin box of cyclin K (14Edwards M.C. Wong C. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). BLAST searches with smaller portions of the predicted amino acid sequence identified a region rich in serine-arginine repeats at the COOH terminus that is highly similar to the RS repeats that are conserved in all the members of the SR protein family of mRNA splicing factors. An alignment of the RS repeats of cyclin L and the human alternative splicing factor ASF/SF2 (25Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Kozak D. Binns G. Cell. 1991; 66: 383-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1 B. A region of 42 amino acids is 77% similar and 66% identical in these proteins, and the location of the RS repeat at the COOH terminus is conserved in both proteins. No homologies to known RNA-binding domains were identified in cyclin L. The tissue distribution and size of cyclin L mRNA was analyzed by Northern blot with poly(A)+ RNA from different human tissues, probed with a radiolabeled 700-bp DNA fragment from the 5′-region of the cyclin L cDNA (Fig. 1 C). Two major bands of 2.3 and 4.5 kb are detected in all the tissues examined and represent alternatively spliced products, as discussed below. The 4.5-kb band is weaker than the 2.3-kb band in most tissues, except in thymus and lymphocytes that express high levels of the 4.5-kb RNA. Identical results were obtained with a DNA probe derived from the 3′ end of the cyclin L cDNA, confirming the authenticity of this cDNA. The human cyclin L gene is located on chromosome 3 in the 3q23.2–3 region. The cyclin L gene is 12.4 kb in length, and is encoded by 14 exons (Fig.2 A) on a 500,000-bp scaffold segment from 156227351 to 156727350 (Celera accession number GA_x54KRCCA4FB) (35Venter J. Adams M. Myers E., Li, P. Mural R. Sutton G. Smith H. Yandell M. Evans C. Holt R. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10698) Google Scholar). There is a CpG island (67% GC) that encompasses the whole of exon 1 and most of exon 2. A TATA-less promoter is predicted by the Gene-Finder program (36Solovyev V. Salamov A. Gaasterland T. Karp P. Karplus K. Ouzounis C. Sander C. Valencia A. Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1997: 294-302Google Scholar), with the transcription start site located 89 bp upstream of the initiation codon. A comparison of the human and mouse cyclin L genes (GenBankTMaccession number AF185590) shows them to be very similar in organization (data not shown). Both genes are ∼12 kb in length, with all shared internal exons of identical length. Exon 8 does not appear to be a coding exon as it was only found in the 3′-untranslated region of the β transcript (see below), and the equivalent of exon 8 is absent from the mouse gene. cDNA cloning revealed that the human cyclin L gene generates a number of alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts. The major transcript has been designated the α transcript that encodes a 526-amino acid residue ORF (Fig.2 B). Exons 4, 7, and 8 are skipped in cyclin Lα mRNA. Cyclin Lα mRNA has 92% identity with the mouse cyclin ania-6a ORF (GenBankTM accession number AF159159) (31Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.-P. Lavoie B. Vincent M. Krause M. Hyman S.E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The only region of divergence between humancyclin Lα and mouse ania-6a is close to the NH2 terminus in a repetitive region. Two other human transcripts encode truncated proteins. The β transcript skips exon 4, terminates in exon 7, and encodes a 232-amino acid residue ORF (GenBankTM accession number AF367476). The γ transcript encodes a 172-amino acid residue ORF, includes exon 4, and terminates within this exon (GenBankTM accession number AY034790). Both the β and γ transcripts are conserved in mouse, where it was shown that the truncated variant is not targeted to the nucleus and does not associate with RNA pol II and splicing factors (31Berke J.D. Sgambato V. Zhu P.-P. Lavoie B. Vincent M. Krause M. Hyman S.E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As noted above, there are 2 major cyclin L transcripts of 2.3 and 4.5 kb detected on a Northern blot (Fig. 1 C). The 2.3-kb band likely represents the α and β transcripts, and an analysis of human and mouse expressed sequence tag data suggests that the 4.5-kb band may represent the γ transcript. Cyclin Lγ is generated by read-through of the donor splice sites from exons 5 to the polyadenylation signal. A cDNA for cyclin Lγ was obtained by screening a human lymphocyte cDNA library. Consistent with this finding, peripheral blood lymphocytes express a large amount of the 4.5-kb cyclin Lγ mRNA (Fig. 1 C). In an effort to clone the human homologue for the B“ subunit of the yeast transcription factor TFIIIB, we used a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the yeast protein (kindly provided by Drs. E. P. Geiduschek and G. A. Kassavetis, University of California, San Diego) to screen a human lymphocyte expression cDNA library. Surprisingly, all the clones obtained from this screen were identified as cyclin Lγ, suggesting that this antibody recognizes one or more epitopes in the human cyclin L protein. We therefore refer to this antibody as anti-L. Moreover, this antibody recognizes a single major band of ∼55–60 kDa in HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig.3 B, lane 3) (the size appears to fluctuate slightly depending on the experiment, probably due to different phosphorylation levels of cyclin L). To determine that this band in HeLa nuclear extracts is cyclin L, we expressed the cyclin Lα cDNA as a GST fusion protein in bacteria and affinity purified the antibody against the recombinant cyclin L protein. Expression of GST-cyclin L in bacteria yields two major bands that migrate at ∼36 and 70 kDa (referred to as p36 and p70). These proteins were identified as cyclin L, since they are both recognized by anti-cyclin L antibody (Fig. 3 A). It was concluded that p36 is a truncated version of the GST-cyclin L protein and not a degradation product, since the band was expressed even in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture. p70 likely represents the full-length fusion protein, although it migrates slightly faster on SDS gels than the predicted molecular mass. Anti-L antibody was affinity-purified using nitrocellulose filter strips that either contained the GST-cyclin L p36 or the p70 peptide. Purified anti-L antibody was then used to probe HeLa nuclear extract, and it recognizes the same 55–60-kDa band as anti-L serum (Fig. 3 B,lane 3) regardless of whether it was purified against p70 or p36 (lanes 1 and 2, respectively). This experiment shows that anti-L recognizes a protein in HeLa nuclear extract that is identical to recombinant cyclin L. Furthermore, a polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant GST-cyclin L (anti-rL) also recognizes the same 55–60-kDa protein in HeLa nuclear extract (data not shown). Anti-L antibody was used to immunoprecipitate cyclin L and any potential kinase partner(s) from a HeLa nuclear extract. Immunoprecipitates were bound to Protein A-Sepharose, washed extensively, and used in an in vitro kinase assay. The substrate specificity of the cyclin L-associated kinase was analyzed with recombinant RNA pol II CTD (GST-CTD), histone H1, splicing factors SC35 and SRp46, GST-cyclin L fusion protein as test substrates, and bovine serum albumin as a negative control. The cyclin L-associated kinase specifically phosphorylates the CTD of pol II, histone H1, and SC35 (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, SRp46, GST-cyclin L, and bovine serum albumin are not substrates for the cyclin L-associated kinase. The lack of phosphorylation of cyclin L and SRp46 demonstrates that the cyclin L-associated kinase is not a general SR protein kinase. As an additional control, these same substrates were tested with immunoprecipitates formed with preimmune serum, and as expected, no kinase activity was detected (Fig.4 A, lanes labeled PI). To confirm that the kinase activity was associated with cyclin L, and was not an artifact of the immunoprecipitation procedure, we incubated purified GST-cyclin L protein with HeLa extract, captured GST-cyclin L, and associated proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads and used the washed beads in an in vitro kinase assay. A potent kinase associates with GST-cyclin L, but not with GST alone as evidenced by the phosphorylation of histone H1 (Fig. 4 B). In additional experiments, we compared the kinase activity of immunoprecipitates formed with anti-cyclin L with those isolated with other antibodies. We used anti-TFIIIA as negative control, and antibodies to the p62 subunit of TFIIH for cdk7 activity, and anti-cdk8 as positive controls for CTD phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). The CTD kinase activity of the anti-cyclin L IP is comparable with that of anti-p62 and anti-cdk8. Anti-cyclin L and anti-p62 IPs also phosphorylate histone H1, whereas anti-cdk8 immunoprecipitates failed to phosphorylate H1 as expected (11Rickert P. Seghezzi W. Shanahan F. Cho H. Lees E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2631-2640PubMed Google Scholar). No significant levels of kinase activity were detected with the preimmune serum and no antibody control reactions. To provide an independent confirmation that a kinase activity is associated with cyclin L, we partially purified cyclin L and associated proteins from HeLa nuclear extracts through three successive rounds of ion exchange chromatography. Fractions containing cyclin L were identified by immunoblotting with anti-cyclin L antibody. Following phosphocellulose, DEAE-Sepharose, and Mono-Q FPLC, fractions that contained cyclin L protein al"

Bile acids secreted into the small intestine are efficiently reabsorbed and reutilized. Activation by thioesterification to CoA is required at two points in bile acid metabolism. First, 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic acid, the 27-carbon precursor of cholic acid, must be activated to its CoA derivative before side chain cleavage via peroxisomal β-oxidation. Second, reutilization of cholate and other C24 bile acids requires reactivation prior to re-conjugation. We reported previously that homolog 2 of very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLCS) can activate cholate (Steinberg, S. J., Mihalik, S. J., Kim, D. G., Cuebas, D. A., and Watkins, P. A. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15605–15608). We now show that this enzyme also activates chenodeoxycholate, the secondary bile acids deoxycholate and lithocholate, and 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic acid. In contrast, VLCS activated 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestanoate, but did not utilize any of the C24 bile acids as substrates. We hypothesize that the primary function of homolog 2 is in the reactivation and recycling of C24 bile acids, whereas VLCS participates in the de novo synthesis pathway. Results ofin situ hybridization, topographic orientation, and inhibition studies are consistent with the proposed roles of these enzymes in bile acid metabolism.

The immediate precursors of the C24 bile acids cholate and chenodeoxycholate are the C27 compounds 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic acid (THCA)1 and 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic acid (DHCA), respectively (1Setchell K.D.R.

It is well established that chain shortening of the methyl-branched side chain of THCA and DHCA by β-oxidation takes place in peroxisomes (3Wanders R.J.A. Barth P.C. Heymans H.S.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York2001: 3219-3256Google Scholar). For β-oxidation to occur, THCA and DHCA must first be activated to their CoA thioesters. The products of chain shortening are choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA and not the free bile acids (4Kase F. Bjorkhem I. Pedersen J.I. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1560-1567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The CoA thioesters of the primary bile acids are conjugated to the amino acid glycine or taurine in the hepatocyte before secretion into the bile canaliculi (1Setchell K.D.R.

Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). After bile secretion into the intestine during digestion, the conjugated primary bile acids are subject to deconjugation, 7α-dehydroxylation, and other modifications by the intestinal flora (1Setchell K.D.R.

Raven Press, New York1994: 677-718Google Scholar). 7α-Dehydroxylation converts conjugated or unconjugated cholate to deoxycholate, and chenodeoxycholate to lithocholate. Deoxycholate and lithocholate are referred to as secondary bile acids. A substantial portion of the intestinal bile acid pool is reabsorbed by passive diffusion throughout the small bowel and by active transport in the distal ileum; all of these compounds return to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation for reutilization (6Carey M.C. Duane W.C. Arias A.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D.A. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 719-767Google Scholar). Recycled unconjugated primary and secondary bile acids must then be re-conjugated to glycine or taurine before return to the bile. However, re-conjugation can occur only after the free acids are activated to their CoA derivatives.We recently demonstrated that human very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase homolog 2 (hVLCS-H2), a liver-specific member of the protein family that includes very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (VLCSs) and fatty acid transport proteins, is a choloyl-CoA synthetase (7Steinberg S.J. Mihalik S.J. Kim D.G. Cuebas D.A. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15605-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a major function of this protein is to activate recycled bile acids prior to their re-conjugation. In this report, we provide further evidence for a role for hVLCS-H2 in activation of primary and secondary bile acids. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hVLCS and hVLCS-H2 are capable of activating the cholic acid precursor (THCA) and speculate on the complementary role of these proteins in bile acid synthesis. Based on the substrate specificity of hVLCS-H2, we will hereafter refer to this protein as human bile acyl-CoA synthetase (hBACS).DISCUSSIONThe synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, conjugation with amino acids, secretion into the bile and subsequently into the intestinal tract, reabsorption from the intestine, and reutilization require the integrated activity of multiple enzymes, organelles, and tissues. At two points in the hepatic phase of bile acid metabolism, activation of the carboxylic acid side chain of the steroid to a CoA derivative is required. First, in the pathway of de novosynthesis from cholesterol, the C27 precursors of cholate and chenodeoxycholate (THCA and DHCA, respectively) must be converted to THCA-CoA and DHCA-CoA for cleavage of three carbons from the side chain to occur. Second, to conjugate the C24 bile acids cholate and chenodeoxycholate to glycine or taurine, their carboxylic acid side chains must first be activated to the corresponding CoA derivatives. The studies reported here begin to address the nature of the acyl-CoA synthetases that are involved in these two aspects of bile acid metabolism.Based on the biochemical and morphological data presented here and our previous findings (7Steinberg S.J. Mihalik S.J. Kim D.G. Cuebas D.A. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15605-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we have developed a working hypothesis regarding the role(s) of hVLCS and hBACS in bile acid metabolism (Fig.7). Conversion of cholesterol to THCA and DHCA requires several enzymatic steps that take place in the endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and mitochondria (1Setchell K.D.R. O'Connell N.C. Suchy F.J. Sokol R.J. Balistreri W.F. Liver Disease in Children. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 701-733Google Scholar, 2Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Activation of THCA and DHCA, precursors of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, respectively, could be catalyzed by either hVLCS or hBACS in the endoplasmic reticulum or by hVLCS in peroxisomes. Once inside peroxisomes, the side chains of THCA-CoA and DHCA-CoA are shortened by three carbons via β-oxidation, yielding choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA, respectively. The peroxisomal enzyme bile acyl-CoA:amino-acid N-acyltransferase (23Kase B.F. Bjorkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9220-9223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) then catalyzes the formation of the glycine and taurine conjugates of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Exiting the peroxisome, the conjugated bile acids are secreted into bile canaliculi and eventually reach the small intestine. Although a large proportion of the conjugated bile acids remain intact, a small quantity undergoes conversion in the bowel. Intestinal flora catalyze both deconjugation and dehydroxylation reactions (1Setchell K.D.R. O'Connell N.C. Suchy F.J. Sokol R.J. Balistreri W.F. Liver Disease in Children. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 701-733Google Scholar, 2Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). 7α-Dehydroxylation of cholate and chenodeoxycholate yields the secondary bile acids deoxycholate and lithocholate, respectively. Intestinal metabolism thus yields a mixture of primary and secondary bile acids that includes both conjugated and free acids. Reabsorption of free bile acids occurs by passive diffusion throughout the small bowel (1Setchell K.D.R. O'Connell N.C. Suchy F.J. Sokol R.J. Balistreri W.F. Liver Disease in Children. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 701-733Google Scholar, 24Bahar R.J. Stolz A. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 27-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When these free acids reach the liver via the portal circulation, they must be reactivated and then conjugated before they are returned to the bile. hBACS is uniquely positioned in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to catalyze the reactivation reaction. Bile acyl-CoA:amino-acid N-acyltransferase is found in the cytoplasm as well as the peroxisome (17Killenberg P.G. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 24-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Soreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following re-conjugation in the cytoplasm, primary and secondary bile acids can be secreted into the bile for reutilization. This hypothesis is consistent with that recently proposed by Solaas et al. (25Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Soreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who investigated bile acyl-CoA:amino-acid N-acyltransferase in human liver.Using subcellular fractions from rat liver, other investigators have shown that activation of THCA to its CoA derivative occurs primarily in microsomes (22Schepers L. Casteels M. Verheyden K. Parmentier G. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Soreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that both hVLCS and hBACS are capable of activating THCA and that both enzymes are found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Because hVLCS is also found in peroxisomes (8Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Steinberg S.J. Kemp S. Braiterman L.T. Watkins P.A. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it is not clear why Schepers et al.(22Schepers L. Casteels M. Verheyden K. Parmentier G. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Solaas et al. (25Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Soreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not detect significant THCA activation in peroxisome-enriched liver fractions. Activation of THCA in peroxisomes rather than in microsomes is a more attractive hypothesis because CoA derivatives generally do not cross biological membranes. hVLCS is oriented in the peroxisomal membrane facing the matrix (20Steinberg S.J. Kemp S. Braiterman L.T. Watkins P.A. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Smith B.T. Sengupta T.K. Singh I. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and activation of THCA would use intraperoxisomal CoA-SH. Amidation of the β-oxidation product, choloyl-CoA, by peroxisomal bile acyl-CoA:amino-acid N-acyltransferase would regenerate free CoA-SH inside the organelle.Alternatively, if activation of THCA takes place solely in the endoplasmic reticulum, the CoA-SH balance must somehow be maintained. A possible mechanism for maintaining a constant intraperoxisomal CoA-SH pool is one in which THCA-CoA entering the organelle is coupled to CoA-SH exiting. However, it is not clear at this time how either THCA or THCA-CoA enters peroxisomes. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether the THCA activation reaction is catalyzed primarily by VLCS or by BACS, if this process does not occur in peroxisomes. Data reported by Schepers et al. (22Schepers L. Casteels M. Verheyden K. Parmentier G. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) on pH dependence and Triton X-100 sensitivity indicate that in rat liver microsomes, the enzyme catalyzing THCA activation is distinct from that catalyzing cholate activation. This suggests that VLCS and not BACS might be the primary enzyme that activates THCA. On the other hand, Wheeler et al. (27Wheeler J.B. Shaw D.R. Barnes S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) purified a bile acid:CoA ligase from rat liver (most likely rat BACS) that activated both chenodeoxycholate and THCA. We plan to address this issue in future studies by investigating THCA activation in subcellular fractions prepared from livers of mice in which the VLCS gene has been disrupted. 2A. K. Heinzer, P. A. Watkins, and K. D. Smith, unpublished data.The data presented here suggest that hVLCS activates THCA more robustly than does hBACS and is not sensitive to inhibition by cholate. These results are consistent with the notion that hVLCS has a diverse role in metabolism, activating both fatty acids and THCA. In contrast, hBACS showed a greater preference for bile acids and their precursors as substrates, suggesting a more limited role for this enzyme (7Steinberg S.J. Mihalik S.J. Kim D.G. Cuebas D.A. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15605-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. McGuinness M.C. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). THCA inhibition of choloyl-CoA synthesis was stronger than cholate inhibition of THCA-CoA synthesis in hBACS-transfected cells. These data are consistent with those reported by Schepers et al. (22Schepers L. Casteels M. Verheyden K. Parmentier G. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) for rat liver microsomes.The peroxisomal pathway for chain shortening of the C27compounds THCA-CoA and DHCA-CoA to C24 bile acids by β-oxidation is now well established (3Wanders R.J.A. Barth P.C. Heymans H.S.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York2001: 3219-3256Google Scholar). In humans, the first step is catalyzed by branched-chain acyl-CoA oxidase, the same enzyme that oxidizes α-methyl-branched fatty acids such as pristanic acid (28Vanhove G.F. Van Veldhoven P.P. Fransen M. Denis S. Eyssen H.J. Wanders R.J.A. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10335-10344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rodents, distinct enzymes carry out these two processes (29Van Veldhoven P.P. Vanhove G. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20065-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). D-bifunctional protein catalyzes the second (enoyl-CoA hydratase) and third (hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) activities (30Dieuaide-Noubhani M. Novikov D. Baumgart E. Vanhooren J.C. Fransen M. Goethals M. Vandekerckhove J. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The thiolase associated with the 58-kDa protein sterol carrier protein X is thought to carry out the final reaction, thiolytic cleavage and release of propionyl-CoA (31Antonenkov V.D. Van Veldhoven P.P. Waelkens E. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26023-26031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the C24 products of the thiolase reaction are the CoA derivatives of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid and not the free acids. Furthermore, bile acyl-CoA:amino-acid N-acyltransferase, the conjugating enzyme, contains a peroxisomal targeting signal and can be detected in this organelle (23Kase B.F. Bjorkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9220-9223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, peroxisomes possess the complete enzymatic machinery required to convert THCA and DHCA into conjugated bile acids.In situ hybridization studies are consistent with the proposed roles of VLCS and BACS in bile acid and fatty acid metabolism. Hepatic lipogenic enzymes appear to have a more perivenous distribution (32Katz N. Thiele J. Giffhorn-Katz S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Katz N.R. Fischer W. Giffhorn S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas the rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, is found mainly in periportal hepatocytes (34Twisk J. Hoekman M.F. Mager W.H. Moorman A.F. de Boer P.A. Scheja L. Princen H.M. Gebhardt R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Expression of hBACS was also found to have a more periportal distribution. The enterohepatic circulation returns bile acids to the liver via the portal vein; thus, hBACS is well positioned to efficiently “scavenge” these bile acids, reactivating them for recycling. In contrast, hVLCS, which robustly activates fatty acids as well as THCA, had a more uniform distribution throughout the liver acinus.The topographic orientation of hBACS, in which both the C and N termini face the cytoplasm, also makes it well suited for its proposed role in reactivation of bile acids returning to the hepatocytes via the enterohepatic circulation. Analysis of the hBACS amino acid sequence by the PHDhtm algorithm revealed that the protein contains no unequivocal transmembrane-spanning domains (35Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The orientation of hVLCS in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, with the N terminus facing the lumen and the C terminus facing the cytoplasm, is consistent with the model proposed by Smith et al. (26Smith B.T. Sengupta T.K. Singh I. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that VLCS is an integral membrane protein in microsomes. Schepers et al. (22Schepers L. Casteels M. Verheyden K. Parmentier G. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were unable to release THCA-CoA synthetase activity from microsomes using high salt alone, consistent with the notion that VLCS and not BACS is primarily responsible for this synthetase activity.In summary, in this report, we have described the ability of two members of the VLCS/fatty acid transport protein family to activate bile acids and their precursors. Based on these data, we presented a working hypothesis regarding the roles of these enzymes in bile acid metabolism. Solaas et al. (25Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Soreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recently hypothesized that the peroxisomal conversion of THCA to choloyl-CoA is the rate-limiting step in production of conjugated bile acids via de novosynthesis. They further proposed that the rate-limiting step in the reutilization of bile acids returning to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation is the reactivation step (25Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Soreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Future studies will enable us to test these hypotheses. The synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol is a complex process requiring modifications of both the steroid nucleus and the aliphatic side chain (reviewed in Refs. 1Setchell K.D.R. O'Connell N.C.

Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, the two primary bile acids in humans, are synthesized in the liver via the concerted action of enzymes located in the endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. The immediate precursors of the C24 bile acids cholate and chenodeoxycholate are the C27 compounds 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic acid (THCA)1 and 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic acid (DHCA), respectively (1Setchell K.D.R.

For β-oxidation to occur, THCA and DHCA must first be activated to their CoA thioesters. The products of chain shortening are choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA and not the free bile acids (4Kase F. Bjorkhem I. Pedersen J.I. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1560-1567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CoA thioesters of the primary bile acids are conjugated to the amino acid glycine or taurine in the hepatocyte before secretion into the bile canaliculi (1Setchell K.D.R. O'Connell N.C.

Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). After bile secretion into the intestine during digestion, the conjugated primary bile acids are subject to deconjugation, 7α-dehydroxylation, and other modifications by the intestinal flora (1Setchell K.D.R. O'Connell N.C. Suchy F.J. Sokol R.J. Balistreri W.F. Liver Disease in Children. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 701-733Google Scholar, 5Hofmann A.F. Arias A.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D.A. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 677-718Google Scholar). 7α-Dehydroxylation converts conjugated or unconjugated cholate to deoxycholate, and chenodeoxycholate to lithocholate. Deoxycholate and lithocholate are referred to as secondary bile acids. A substantial portion of the intestinal bile acid pool is reabsorbed by passive diffusion throughout the small bowel and by active transport in the distal ileum; all of these compounds return to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation for reutilization (6Carey M.C. Duane W.C. Arias A.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D.A. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 719-767Google Scholar). Recycled unconjugated primary and secondary bile acids must then be re-conjugated to glycine or taurine before return to the bile. However, re-conjugation can occur only after the free acids are activated to their CoA derivatives. We recently demonstrated that human very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase homolog 2 (hVLCS-H2), a liver-specific member of the protein family that includes very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (VLCSs) and fatty acid transport proteins, is a choloyl-CoA synthetase (7Steinberg S.J.

We hypothesized that a major function of this protein is to activate recycled bile acids prior to their re-conjugation. In this report, we provide further evidence for a role for hVLCS-H2 in activation of primary and secondary bile acids. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hVLCS and hVLCS-H2 are capable of activating the cholic acid precursor (THCA) and speculate on the complementary role of these proteins in bile acid synthesis. Based on the substrate specificity of hVLCS-H2, we will hereafter refer to this protein as human bile acyl-CoA synthetase (hBACS). DISCUSSIONThe synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, conjugation with amino acids, secretion into the bile and subsequently into the intestinal tract, reabsorption from the intestine, and reutilization require the integrated activity of multiple enzymes, organelles, and tissues. At two points in the hepatic phase of bile acid metabolism, activation of the carboxylic acid side chain of the steroid to a CoA derivative is required. First, in the pathway of de novosynthesis from cholesterol, the C27 precursors of cholate and chenodeoxycholate (THCA and DHCA, respectively) must be converted to THCA-CoA and DHCA-CoA for cleavage of three carbons from the side chain to occur. Second, to conjugate the C24 bile acids cholate and chenodeoxycholate to glycine or taurine, their carboxylic acid side chains must first be activated to the corresponding CoA derivatives. The studies reported here begin to address the nature of the acyl-CoA synthetases that are involved in these two aspects of bile acid metabolism.Based on the biochemical and morphological data presented here and our previous findings (7Steinberg S.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15605-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we have developed a working hypothesis regarding the role(s) of hVLCS and hBACS in bile acid metabolism (Fig.7). Conversion of cholesterol to THCA and DHCA requires several enzymatic steps that take place in the endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and mitochondria (1Setchell K.D.R. O'Connell N.C. Suchy F.J.

Here, we demonstrate that UVB induces Bad phosphorylation at serine 112 in JNK1, RSK2, and MSK1-dependent pathways. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases including ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase by the use of their respective dominant negative mutant or a specific inhibitor for MEK1 or p38 kinase, PD98059 or SB202190, resulted in abrogation of UVB-induced phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112. Incubation of active MAP kinase members with Bad protein showed serine 112 phosphorylation of Bad by JNK1 only. However, activated RSK2 and MSK1, downstream kinases of ERKs and p38 kinase, respectively, also phosphorylated Bad at serine 112 in vitro. Cells from a Coffin-Lowry syndrome patient (deficient in RSK2) or expressing an N-terminal or C-terminal kinase-dead mutant of MSK1 were defective for UVB-induced serine 112 phosphorylation of Bad. Furthermore, MAP kinase pathway-dependent serine 112 phosphorylation was shown to be required for dissociation of Bad from Bcl-XL.

Alterations of both pathways contribute to the clonal expansion of cancer cells. The Bcl-2 family of related proteins contains protein-protein interaction domains that facilitate homo- and heterodimerization. Some members, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and A1, promote cell survival, whereas others, Bad, Bid, Bax, and Bak, promote cell death. A possible mechanism exists whereby the interactions resulting in homo- or heterodimerization of the various proteins define the fate of a cell (1Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

Bad, for example, has been shown to heterodimerize with Bcl-XL through interaction with its Bcl-2 homology 3 domain at the mitochondrial membrane (3Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J. Waksman G.

Mutation of either of these residues to alanine potentiates cell death following transient transfection with Bad, suggesting that both are critical in the disruption of Bad-Bcl-XL heterodimers.Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, especially in the UVB range (290–320 nm), is an important environmental factor of inducible health hazards for mankind, which include the induction of skin cancer (15de Gruijl F.R.

Similar to chemical agents, UV has the ability to activate various signal transduction pathways and to induce the expression of specific genes (18Herrlich P. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Rev. Physiol.

A great deal of progress has been made recently in elucidating the mechanisms of the UV-induced apoptotic signaling transduction pathways (21Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D., Xu, J. Turner T.K.

However, much less is known about the UV-induced survival-signaling pathway, especially during the immediate time following UV radiation.One of the major UV responsive pathways is the Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases cascade (23Dhanasekaran N. Premkumar Reddy E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). MAP kinases belong to a large family of serine/threonine protein kinases comprising three distinct components: extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 kinase. Generally, JNKs and p38 kinase are known to be activated by various forms of stress, such as UV radiation, heat shock, and inflammation (24Derijard B. Hibi M., Wu, I.H. Barrett T., Su, B. Deng T.

Our studies and those of others have shown that ERKs are critical for UV-induced signal transduction (27Huang C., Ma, W.Y. Dong Z.

Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), whether UVB radiation induces Bad phosphorylation and the signaling pathways that are involved in the phosphorylation remains largely unknown. MAP kinases have been implicated in both apoptosis and survival signaling (34Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar, 35Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 36Roulston A.

Sabbadini RA Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possible role of MAP kinase signaling pathways in the regulation of Bad phosphorylation and its function following UVB radiation. In this study, we demonstrated that UVB radiation induces Bad phosphorylation at serine 112, but not serine 136. Using a dominant negative mutant of ERK2, JNK1, p38 kinase, or an N-terminal or C-terminal kinase-dead mutant of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), RSK2-deficient cells, and a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) or p38 kinase, we conclude that UVB-induced phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 is mediated through MAP kinase signaling pathways in which JNK1, RSK2, and MSK1 have a direct role in the regulation of Bad phosphorylation and its function.DISCUSSIONThe phosphorylation of Bad, a Bcl-2 family protein, may represent an important bridge between survival signaling by growth factor receptors and the prevention of apoptosis. Oncogenes involved in the signal transduction of growth factor receptors may mediate the requirement for extracellular stimuli to maintain protection from apoptosis, in part by increasing Bad phosphorylation. Therefore, identifying the specific signaling pathways involved in the regulation of Bad is crucial in our understanding of oncogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that Bad is phosphorylated at serine 112, but not serine 136, early after UVB radiation. Furthermore, we found that UVB-induced serine 112 phosphorylation of Bad depends on MAP kinase signaling pathways in which JNK1 directly mediates serine 112 phosphorylation, whereas RSK2 and MSK1 transduce ERKs and p38 kinase signals by phosphorylating Bad.Exposure of cells to UV radiation elicits a complex set of acute cellular responses called “UV responses.” The initial signal triggering the UV response is in large part independent of DNA damage, but it instead appears to be mediated by a membrane-associated component of the Ras pathway and activation of MAP kinases (23Dhanasekaran N. Premkumar Reddy E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). ERKs are involved in survival signaling in response to a variety of growth factors (10Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar, 35Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1998; 95: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas activation of JNKs or p38 kinase is suggested to play decisive roles in the control of cell death (34Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). The early activation of JNKs and p38 kinase by tumor necrosis factor-α and overexpression of MAP kinase kinase 6, an upstream kinase of p38 kinase, also have been reported to contribute to survival signaling (36Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 37Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M.

Our recent study demonstrates the requirement of JNK activation for tumor necrosis factor-α-induced JB6 cell transformation (44Huang C., Li, J.X., Ma, W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29672-29676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Embryos with disruption of Jnk1 andJnk2 genes exhibit increased apoptosis in the development of forebrain (54Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 55Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K. Chang L. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In addition, integrin-mediated survival signaling has been shown to be mediated by the JNK pathway (56Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, little direct evidence has been obtained to show that the MAP kinase family regulates survival-signaling components in response to UV radiation. Very recently, we reported that ERK- and p38 kinase-dependent MSK1 activation, in addition to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway, is required for Akt activation early after UVB radiation (45Nomura M. Kaji A, Ma, W.Y. Zhong S. Liu G. Bowden G.T. Miyamoto K. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further found that MAP kinases mediate UVB-induced Bad phosphorylation at serine 112. The results of our study indicated that JNK1 is a direct mediator of UVB-induced phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 (Figs.3 B and 4 A). Although ERKs and p38 kinase did not directly phosphorylate Bad at serine 112, RSK2, a downstream kinase of ERKs (Fig. 4 B) (50Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), and MSK1, a downstream kinase of ERKs and p38 kinase (41Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R.

Furthermore, the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 was found to be required for Bad dissociation from Bcl-XL (Fig. 7). Therefore, these data suggest a novel role for MAP kinases and their downstream kinases in the regulation of survival signal transduction pathways immediately following UV radiation. However, the significance of the members of MAP kinases being required for UVB-induced serine 112 phosphorylation of Bad and regulation of its function is not presently known. Some evidence indicates that cross-talk among ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase signaling may play an important role in determining cell survival and death (34Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar, 57Canman C.E. Kastan M.D. Nature. 1996; 384: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Further study will be required to confirm this hypothesis.UV-induced Bad phosphorylation at a single residue, serine 112, and activation of the PI3-K/Akt survival pathway have also recently been observed in human skin cells by Wan et al. (58Wan Y.S. Wang Z.Q. Shao Y. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 461-466PubMed Google Scholar). They showed that the UV-induced serine 112 phosphorylation of Bad occurred in a PI3-K-dependent manner by using PI3-K inhibitors such as LY294002 and wortmannin. However, Akt, a downstream kinase of PI3-K, has been shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of Bad specifically at serine 136, but not serine 112 (8Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H.

Our recent results also showed that pretreatment with LY294002 or overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of PI3-K subunit p85 blocks UVB-induced ERKs and MSK1 activation (45Nomura M. Kaji A, Ma, W.Y. Zhong S. Liu G. Bowden G.T. Miyamoto K. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) as well as activation of RSK2 (data not shown), indicating the requirement for PI3-K upstream of ERKs following UVB radiation. The phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 induced by UVB was also confirmed to be partially inhibited by pretreatment with 12.5–25 μm LY294002 in our experiments (data not shown). However, in light of the above findings and in context with our results here, inhibition of Bad serine 112 phosphorylation by LY294002 most likely occurs through inhibition of the ERKs/RSK2 and ERKs/MSK1 pathways, but not Akt.PKA has been shown to mediate IL-3-induced phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 in a cAMP-dependent manner, offering an explanation for the survival-promoting effects of cAMP in some cell types (12Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M. Huang L.J. Taylor SS Scott J.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have reported that the level of cAMP was not affected after stimulation with cytokines, suggesting that PKA activation by cAMP is not the principle means for Bad phosphorylation at serine 112 (62Scheid M.P. Foltz I.N. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. Duronio V. Blood. 1999; 93: 217-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 63Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Very recently, we showed that PKA was not activated following UVB radiation (46Zhong S.P. Jansen C. She Q.B. Goto H. Inagaki M. Bode A.M., Ma, W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that PKA may not be involved in UVB-induced Bad phosphorylation at serine 112.Recently, α- and γ-PAK have also been shown to phosphorylate Bad at serine 112 in vitro and in vivo (13Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 14Jakobi R. Moertl E. Koeppel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16624-16634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Activation of α-PAK was shown to be induced by IL-3 in FL5.12 lymphoid progenitor cells (13Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), but not by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in BALB3T3 fibroblasts (14Jakobi R. Moertl E. Koeppel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16624-16634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These results indicate that activation of α-PAK may depend on cell type differences or different extracellular stimuli. Furthermore, whether α-PAK is involved in IL-3-induced endogenous Bad phosphorylation at serine 112 has not been determined (13Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Overexpression of constitutively active γ-PAK stimulates cell survival of BALB3T3 fibroblasts in response to TNF-α, growth factor withdrawal, and UVC radiation (14Jakobi R. Moertl E. Koeppel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16624-16634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 by γ-PAK may be one of the mechanisms for protection from cell death. However, whether UVC radiation induction of endogenous Bad phosphorylation and γ-PAK is required for the phosphorylation has not yet been investigated. Interestingly, expression of active γ-PAK increases the early activation of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase induced by TNF-α (14Jakobi R. Moertl E. Koeppel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16624-16634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Currently, we are also identifying the upstream effectors of MAP kinases involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112. Whether γ-PAK is one of the candidate effectors will need to be determined.A number of published works have suggested that serine 136 phosphorylation of Bad is physiologically important. Expression of a mutant Bad in which serine 136 was changed to alanine potentiates apoptosis, arguing that the inability of Akt to phosphorylate this altered residue promotes association with Bcl-XL, thus leading to cell death (7Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar, 8Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4914) Google Scholar, 64Blume-Jensen P. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 779-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, singly phosphorylated Bad at serine 112 also proved incapable of binding to Bcl-XL (7Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Our studies here with endogenous Bad argue that Bad-Bcl-XLassociation is disrupted independently of serine 136 phosphorylation. Rather, the dissociation is primarily dependent upon the phosphorylation state of serine 112. The phosphorylation of Bad at serine 136 could not be detected following UVB radiation (Fig. 1). Furthermore, Bad was not shown to be phosphorylated at serine 136 by active MAP kinases (data not shown) and inhibition of MAP kinases did not result in activation of other protein kinases such as Akt (45Nomura M. Kaji A, Ma, W.Y. Zhong S. Liu G. Bowden G.T. Miyamoto K. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to phosphorylate Bad at serine 136 after UVB radiation (Fig. 7). On the other hand, loss of serine 112 phosphorylation of Bad, through inhibition of MAP kinases including ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase, completely restores the association of Bad with Bcl-XL(Fig. 7). Therefore, these results suggest that serine 136 may not necessarily be phosphorylated for cell survival in response to UVB radiation.In summary, our studies demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 induced by UVB radiation is mediated by the signaling of MAP kinases and their downstream kinases (Fig.8). In addition to serine 112 phosphorylation of Bad by RSK2 as demonstrated previously (10Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar, 11Tan Y. Ruan H. Demeter M.R. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34859-34867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), our results further identify JNK1 and MSK1 as novel and direct signal mediators of serine 112 phosphorylation in response to UVB radiation. The phosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 by MAP kinase-dependent pathways may cooperate with the PI3-K/Akt pathway (45Nomura M. Kaji A, Ma, W.Y. Zhong S. Liu G. Bowden G.T. Miyamoto K. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to balance UV-induced apoptotic signals, thereby preventing widespread cell death. Conversely, activation of these survival pathways by UV radiation may enhance inappropriate cell survival leading to skin cancer, as has been found in several other types of cancer (29Merienne K. Jacquot S. Zeniou M. Pannetier S. Sassone-Corsi P. Hanauer A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 65Altiok S. Batt D. Altiok N. Papautsky A. Downward J. Roberts T.M. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32274-32278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the cascade of molecular signals in the UV-induced survival pathway may be helpful in designing therapeutic targets for prevention of skin cancer induced by UV radiation. The development and maintenance of healthy tissues is critically dependent on a balance between cell survival and cell death (apoptosis). Alterations of both pathways contribute to the clonal expansion of cancer cells. The Bcl-2 family of related proteins contains protein-protein interaction domains that facilitate homo- and heterodimerization. Some members, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and A1, promote cell survival, whereas others, Bad, Bid, Bax, and Bak, promote cell death. A possible mechanism exists whereby the interactions resulting in homo- or heterodimerization of the various proteins define the fate of a cell (1Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 2Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Bad, for example, has been shown to heterodimerize with Bcl-XL through interaction with its Bcl-2 homology 3 domain at the mitochondrial membrane (3Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J."

Oxford University Press, New York1999: 200-248Google Scholar). The IP3R is widely distributed in living systems and plays pivotal roles in fundamental processes including fertilization, cellular proliferation and differentiation, cellular signaling, and vesicle secretion (2Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 200-248Google Scholar). Molecular cloning studies have revealed that there are three isoforms of IP3R and that alternative splicing results in several variants of the IP3R (2Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 200-248Google Scholar). These divergent primary structures of the IP3R and their differential distributions have been assumed to award the functional diversity of IP3R by nature. The most characterized type 1 IP3R (IP3R1), a predominant type in rodent cerebellar endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and spine apparatus, plays an integral role in Ca2+ signaling (3Miyazaki S. Yuzaki M.

The protomer of IP3R1, a 2749-amino acid polypeptide (Mr 313,000), contains the IP3-binding core (residues 226–578), membrane-spanning domains (residues 2276–2589), and widespread allosteric sites for intracellular effector molecules (Ca2+, calmodulin, and ATP) and for phosphorylation by protein kinases (cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and tyrosine kinase) (2Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 200-248Google Scholar). These cumulative allosteric regulations imply a structural paradigm for global conformational changes within the higher ordered structure of IP3R1. Because Ca2+ rigorously determines the channel activity of IP3R and Ca2+-dependent behavior of IP3R is considered to be crucial for spatiotemporal organizations of Ca2+ signaling (1Berrige M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar, 4Miyakawa T. Mizushima A. Hirose K. Yamazawa T. Bezprozvanny I. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the most important regulator for IP3R is Ca2+per se. Previous functional analysis indicates that a low Ca2+level acts as an essential coagonist for IP3-gated Ca2+ release and a high Ca2+ level inversely acts as a feedback repressor (4Miyakawa T.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thereby we assumed that Ca2+ could induce alterations in conformational states of IP3R1 underlying such dynamic regulations. An investigation of this hypothesis requires information about structural rearrangements that has heretofore been unclear because of the structural polymorphism within IP3R particles, which is partially due to their fragile architectures, presented by previous electron microscopic studies (11Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Chadwick C.C. Saito A. Fleischer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To address this issue, we improved rapid purification of the IP3R1 channel so that we could use electron microscopic study to visualize the domain arrangement and to investigate its structural change by Ca2+. Immunoaffinity purification of IP3R1 was performed as described previously (15Nakade S. Rhee S.K. Hamanaka H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6735-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Microsomal membrane (3 mg/ml), prepared from mouse cerebella, was solubilized in 50 mmTris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% (w/v) CHAPS, 150 mmKCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm E-64, and 0.2 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA. The solubilized IP3R1 was mixed with pep6Ab-immobilized beads, incubated at 4 °C, washed, and eluted with 20 μm pep 6. The [3H]-IP3 binding assay was performed as described previously (11Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The purified IP3R1 (0.5 μl) was injected into 9.5 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmEDTA, or 1 mm EGTA and incubated for 30 min on ice. For heparin-gold labeling, purified IP3R1 was mixed with a 5–10-fold molar excess of heparin-gold (Sigma) and incubated for 10 min on ice. An aliquot of the mixture (4 μl) was applied onto carbon-coated copper grids. Excess solution was removed by filter paper, and the IP3R1 particles were stained with 2 μl of 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution. Dried grids were examined on a JEM 1200 EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL) operated at 80-kV acceleration voltage. Micrographs were taken at magnifications ranging from ×25,000 to ×50,000. Partial proteolysis experiments were carried out in the solution containing IP3R1 and lysyl endopeptidase (Lys-C). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The proteolysis was stopped by heat treatments at 55 °C for 15 min in the sample buffer including SDS. Proteolytic fragments were analyzed by discontinuous PAGE (5 or 10% gel) and immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies 18A10 and 4C11 (11Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15Nakade S. Rhee S.K. Hamanaka H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6735-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We purified IP3R1 to apparent homogeneity as judged by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A) from mouse cerebella, which was functionally active as estimated by the specific activity of maximum binding to IP3 (3 nmol/mg of protein). The purified IP3R1 was negatively stained and imaged in a transmission electron microscope. Electron microscopy explicitly showed two distinct structures in negatively stained samples. One was a windmill-like structure (Fig. 1B), and another was a square-shaped structure (Fig. 1C). The windmill structure contained four segregated radial wings and a central core. Each wing structure appeared to be composed of two domains: a globular domain, which often exhibited a central spot that was densely stained, and a constricted segment forming a bridge between the globular domain and the central core domain. The dimension of the windmill structure was 31 ± 2 nm (n = 76) from the tip of one wing to the tip of the opposite wing. The globular domain in the wing was 8.1 ± 0.8 nm (n = 30) in diameter, and the central core was 9.8 ± 0.6 nm (n = 15) in diameter. The shape and dimensions of the windmill structure are consistent with those previously reported for IP3R isolated from smooth muscle (12Chadwick C.C. Saito A. Fleischer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The dimensions of the square structure were 19 ± 1 nm (n = 54) on a side and 24 ± 1 nm (n = 54) on a diagonal line (Fig. 1C), similar to that of small dense projections in the smooth ER of rat Purkinje cells (14Kanaseki T. Ikeuch Y. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Comparison with the dimensions of ryanodine receptor, another intracellular Ca2+channel (16Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), provides support that the projected size of the square structure in this study is reasonable because of the ratio in the molecular mass of the protomer. We also found that the IP3R1 particles appeared as other forms, suggesting their variances of orientation or intrinsic flexibilities. Our microscopic data revealed two distinct states of the IP3R1 molecule, leading us to the hypothesis that the conformation of IP3R1 alters. We tried to capture a Ca2+-dependent transition between the dual structures by imaging IP3R1 particles injected into 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EDTA, or 1 mm EGTA. Significantly the windmill structures were abundantly observed in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig.2A). In contrast, the relative abundance of windmill structures appeared to decrease in specimens prepared in solution containing 1 mm EDTA (Fig.2B). For statistical evaluation, we counted the windmill particles with more than three identifiable wings and the square forms with a homologous dimension, which had no wing, on electron micrographs. Quantitative analysis clearly indicates a significant difference in the ratio of the two structures in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Readdition of CaCl2 into the IP3R1 purified with EDTA restored the windmill configuration, and the number of windmill structures showed a marked reduction upon readdition of EDTA into the IP3R1 purified in the presence of Ca2+, indicating that the structural rearrangements are reversible (Fig. 2C). IP3 did not induce significant changes in each state at this resolution, thus the binding of IP3 may cause a fine structural change to open the channel. Our findings provide the first evidence of structural alterations in IP3R1 molecules. The structural alteration could account for the polymorphism in IP3R particles presented by previous electron microscopic studies (11Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Chadwick C.C. Saito A. Fleischer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The unique architectures and conspicuous conformational changes within the IP3R1 particle differ remarkably from those in the ryanodine receptor particle (17Orlova E.V. Serysheva I.I. van Heel M. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Sharma M.R. Jeyakumar L.H. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9485-9491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These differences might result from intrinsic properties of the gating machinery of IP3R1. To correlate the structural changes in IP3R1 observed by electron microscopy with changes in solution, we monitored its sensitivity to limited protease digestion. The patterns of degradative intermediates were clearly Ca2+-dependent (Fig.3). In particular, a 38-kDa fragment detected with 4C11 within the IP3-binding domain was markedly generated by cleavage in CaCl2 solution; however, a 48-kDa intermediate and a 38–60-kDa ladder of bands detected with 4C11 were dominantly observed in EDTA solution (Fig. 3B). Furthermore a C-terminal 130-kDa fragment detected with 18A10 was abundantly detected by cleavage of purified IP3R1 in CaCl2 solution compared with 85- and 120-kDa fragments (Fig. 3B). These results suggest structural changes in purified IP3R1 rather than a simple acceleration or regulation of proteolysis by Ca2+. The degradation by contaminant protease, such as Ca2+-activated calpains, was insignificant because of negligible production of digested proteins without Lys-C (Fig. 3). In addition, we also investigated the dynamic property of IP3R1 in crude microsomal membrane. The 38- and 30-kDa fragments detected with 4C11 were evenly precipitated in both CaCl2 and EDTA solutions; however, these fragments were more releasable to supernatant fractions in the presence of CaCl2 than in EDTA (Fig. 3C). We also confirmed the reproducibility of these proteolysis experiments by using 0.5 mm EGTA and 0.2 mm CaCl2 solution. This heightened ability to release may be related to the structural changes within IP3R1 embedded in the microsomal membrane. Taken together, these biochemical data strongly support the presence of structural alterations in IP3R1. To determine how functional domains are arranged, we used colloidal gold conjugated with heparin, which is a competitive inhibitor of IP3 binding (19Ghosh T.K. Eis P.S. Mullaney J.M. Ebert C.L.

Heparin-gold particles bound not only to the windmill structure but also to the square form (Fig.4, A and B). In the windmill structure, the gold particles bound to the globular domain of the radial wings (Fig. 4A). In the square form, the gold particles attached at the sites close to the corners (Fig.4B). We assigned these heparin-binding domains to the N-terminal IP3-binding domain. Our results provide the first evidence of domain arrangement in quaternary configurations of the IP3R1 particle. In both states, the distribution of peripheral IP3-binding domains occurred away from the center, a plausible Ca2+ gateway, by over 5 nm, suggesting that a long range allosteric transmission took place underlying the IP3-gated Ca2+ release. The comparison between dual structures and mapping of heparin-binding sites indicates that the structural transition from square to windmill is caused by the relocation of functional domains. Therefore, we propose a “flapping model” for the large scale rearrangements in IP3R1 (Fig. 4C). The windmill structure may be a consequence of the IP3-binding domain splitting from the channel domain. The dynamic flapping may be mediated by the bridge domain, which may act as a hinge structure. Additionally the digested IP3R retains the assembly of domains under Ca2+-free conditions (21Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); thus interdomain coupling may also stabilize the more compact square structure. The Ca2+-dependent cleavage sites and releasable regions presented here are candidates for the apparent hinge and interface structures linking between functional domains. Our findings show that the functional regulator altered the relative locations of IP3-binding and channel domains even if there is no IP3, further emphasizing that the domain arrangement is crucial for the transmission of IP3 binding cues to Ca2+ pores. Two discrete configurations of IP3R1 imply dual relay modes controlling the allosteric transmission. Which of two structures is more active? As it appears to have an advantage for direct transferring of conformational changes by IP3 binding toward the central channel, we cannot exclude the possibility that the compact square form is an active state. Based on single channel analysis, however, high Ca2+ only acts as an activator toward purified IP3R1 (10Michikawa T. Hirota J. Kawano S. Hiraoka M. Yamada M. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1999; 23: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Hence it is favorable that the windmill structure is more active. In this case, it is conceivable that the bridge domain presents an effective relay of ligand binding signals. This notion fascinates us as a new type of mechanical control on ligand gating behavior. The three-dimensional structure at much higher resolution will answer our central question on the precise pathway of allosteric transmission from the IP3-binding core to the Ca2+ gateway underlying IP3-gated channel opening. Ca2+ dependence of IP3R is known to interplay with the allosteric regulation by ATP (23Thrower E.C. Mobasheri H. Dargan S. Marius P. Lea E.J.A. Dawson A.P. J. Biol.

Thereby the Ca2+-dependent global conformational changes may concern primary states for other allosteric ligands. Since IP3R is known to interact with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate incorporated in the plasma membrane (25Lupu V.D. Kaznacheyeva E. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol.

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been postulated to regulate the ether à go-go(eag) potassium channel in Drosophila. Inhibition of CaMKII and mutation of the eag gene both cause hyperexcitability at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and memory formation defects in the adult. In this study, we identify a single site, threonine 787, as the major CaMKII phosphorylation site in Eag. This site can be phosphorylated by CaMKII both in a heterologous cell system and in vivo at the larval NMJ. Expression of Eag in Xenopus oocytes was used to assess the function of phosphorylation. Injection of either a specific CaMKII inhibitor peptide or lavendustin C, another CaMKII inhibitor, reduced Eag current amplitude acutely. Mutation of threonine 787 to alanine also reduced amplitude. Moreover, both CaMKII inhibition and the alanine mutation accelerated inactivation. The reduction in current amplitudes and the accelerated inactivation of dephosphorylated Eag channels would result in decreased outward potassium currents and hyperexcitability at presynaptic terminals and, thus, are consistent with the NMJ phenotype observed when CaMKII is inhibited. These results show that Eag is a substrate of CaMKII and suggest that direct modulation of potassium channels may be an important function of this kinase.

Modulation of potassium channel activity by kinases has key importance in regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (1Levitan I.B. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 3-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Theether-à-go-go (eag) gene inDrosophila encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that has a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain with homology to cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (2Warmke J. Drysdale R.

Science. 1991; 254: 730Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This channel is the founding member of a superfamily of vertebrate and invertebrate genes, which includeeag, elk, and erg subfamilies (4Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). In flies, mutation of the eag gene causes shaking after exposure to ether (5Kaplan W.D. Trout W.E. Genetics. 1969; 61: 399-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hyperexcitability at the NMJ1 (6Wu C.F. Ganetzky B. Haugland F.N. Liu A.X. Science. 1983; 220: 1076-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These phenotypes have been demonstrated with both hypomorphic and null alleles ofeag (see, for example, the NMJ phenotypes ofeag1 , a hypomorph, andeagsc29 , a null, in Ref. 7Griffith L.C. Wang J.

In humans, mutation of the HERG gene is one cause of long QT syndrome (8Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). Genetic interactions between Drosophilacalcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and Eag have suggested the hypothesis that Eag is a downstream target for CaMKII-mediated modulation of neuronal function (7Griffith L.C. Wang J. Zhong Y., Wu, C.F. Greenspan R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10044-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CaMKII by expression of a kinase-specific autoinhibitory domain peptide produced supernumerary excitatory junctional potentials at the third instar NMJ. This excitability defect was similar in many respects to that of eag mutants, and expression of the inhibitor on aneag background produced nonadditive effects on excitability. Both expression of inhibitory peptide and eag mutations blocked memory formation of courtship conditioning (7Griffith L.C. Wang J. Zhong Y., Wu, C.F. Greenspan R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10044-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These data suggested that CaMKII and Eag may function in a common pathway that regulates neuronal plasticity. To investigate the direct interaction of Eag and CaMKII, we have identified a CaMKII phosphorylation site on Eag. We find that Eag is expressed in both the axon and the terminal boutons of motor neurons, where it is phosphorylated in vivo. We also present evidence that phosphorylation of this site can modulate channel function. Fragments of the Eag cDNA were cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) to make GST fusion proteins. The corresponding starting and ending amino acids of the fragments are as listed: pGEX-GST-Eag-N, amino acids 44–210; pGEX-GST-Eag-C1, amino acids 556–802; and pGEX-GST-Eag-C2, amino acids 556–1174. PCR was used to create Eag mutants. Oligonucleotide sequences of primers used for generating the mutants are as follows: S576A, 5′-GACATATGTGTTCATCTAAATCGCAAAGTATTTGACGAGCATCCGACATTTCGTCTGGCCGCGGATGGT-3′; T655A, 5′-TCTGGCCTATTGTGATTTG-3′ and 5′-CACAATAGGCCAGAGCAC-3′; T787A, 5′-GGGAATTCTCGCGACTTGGCGGCGAGGAGTCCACCTCGCCACCCTCATCGATCGCGTCCTG-3′. Mutations are underlined. The double mutants S576A/T787A and S576A/T655A were made by subcloning fragments containing one mutation into pGEXGST-Eag-C1 that contains the other mutation. Sequences were verified by DNA sequencing (Brandeis Biochemistry Core Facility). GST fusion proteins An overnight bacterial culture of Escherichia coliPR745 (New England Biolabs) transformed with the appropriate plasmid was diluted at 1:100 in 1 liter of LB/carbenicillin and grown at 37 °C for 3 h or until A 600 = 0.8. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Promega) to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The culture was allowed to grow at 37 °C for another 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The protocol for purification was modified from the manufacturer instructions from the glutathione-Sepharose-4B column (AmershamBiosciences). To purify the fusion proteins, cell pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the mixture was sonicated at maximum setting three times (30 s each). After spinning at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was removed to a 50-ml tube. Glutathione-Sepharose-4B was prepared as instructed and equilibrated with the lysis buffer to make a 50% suspension. 2 ml of the bead suspension was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for periods ranging from 2 h to overnight. The beads were spun down at low speed for 3 min in a clinical centrifuge at 4 °C and washed three times (20 min each) by rotating gently, first with 40 ml of lysis buffer plus 1% Triton, second with 40 ml of lysis buffer plus 400 mm NaCl, and third with 40 ml of lysis buffer only. After each wash, beads were collected by spinning. The fusion proteins were eluted in four fractions of 2 ml each of freshly made elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mmreduced glutathione from Sigma) by rotating for 30 min at 4 °C. Fractions were pooled and concentrated in a Centriprep column (Amicon) with a molecular mass cut-off of 30 kDa. Fusion proteins were snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at −20 °C. Generation of polyclonal rabbit antibodies employed standard procedures (9Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) at the Foster Animal Facility (Brandeis University, Waltham, MA). GST-Eag-N (250 μg) fusion protein was mixed with Freund's adjuvant and injected into rabbits subcutaneously. Sera were screened against the antigen using dot blots and Western blots. Purification of anti-Eag antibodies was carried out according to Ref. 9Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar; HIS-Eag-N was bound to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column and washed with 10 volumes of Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Serum (in 25-ml batches) was loaded several times at a rate of 20 ml/h. The column was washed with 10 volumes of Tris buffer, 20 volumes of Tris buffer plus 500 mm NaCl, and 10 volumes of Tris buffer, pH 8.8. The column was eluted with 10 ml of tetraethylamine, pH 11.5, and the eluate neutralized with 1 ml of Tris buffer, pH 8. Eluates were pooled, dialyzed against PBS, and then concentrated. A peptide corresponding to Eag amino acid sequence 784–792 (NH2-CRQDpT787IDEGG, chemically phosphorylated at Thr-787) was synthesized (Alpha Diagnostic, Inc). The N-terminal cysteine was added to facilitate conjugation onto an agarose support. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as instructed (Pierce, Imject activated immunogen conjugation kit or Imject maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin) for immunization (250 μg of protein/rabbit/injection). For purification, the phosphopeptide was immobilized on a cross-linked agarose support (Pierce, SulfoLink kit) and the antibodies purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST fusion proteins were phosphorylated in an assay reaction of 50 μl containing 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, and either 50 μm ATP or 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1 Ci/mmol). Reactions were run at 30 °C. Following appropriate incubations, 25 μl of SDS sample loading buffer (9% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.186 m Tris pH 8.9, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to the reaction mixture and heated at 100 °C for 3 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting or exposed to film if radioactive. Eag cDNAs were cloned into pCS2+MT (10Rupp R.A.W. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) for transfection of mammalian tsA201 cells and into pEGFP (CLONTECH) to produce GFP fusion proteins. tsA201 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% Cosmic calf serum (HyClone) in a humidified 95% O2 and 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were seeded at 106cells/100-mm dish and transfected with DNA constructs 24 h later, using the calcium phosphate method (11Ausubel F.M., R., B. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). 15 μg of Eag DNA and 7.5 μg of CaMKII DNA were used per plate. DNA precipitates were removed 16 h after transfection, and the cells were allowed to grow for another 36–40 h. Cells were harvested by pipetting in 1 ml/plate solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNaVO3, 1 mm EDTA, 1% CHAPS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 μm microcystin-LR). Cells were solubilized in microcentrifuge tubes by rotating at 4 °C for 30 min and then spun for 15 min at 14,000 × g. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes. The protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Extracts containing 300 μg of total protein were incubated with an anti-Eag antibody overnight at 4 °C, and the immunocomplex was precipitated by incubating with protein A beads (Santa Cruz). After beads were washed three times with the solubilization buffer, proteins were eluted by boiling in loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins or cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose electrophoretically, and probed with antibodies as previously described (12Wilson G.F. Wang Z. Chouinard S.W.

Affinity-purified anti-Eag was used at 1:500, and affinity-purified anti-Thr(P)-787 was used at 1:100. Relative intensity of signals was determined by densitometry using the Bio-Rad Gel Doc software. tsA201 cells were grown on acid-washed, poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips (Fisher). After transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized by incubating with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and washed three times with PBS (5 min each). Cells were then incubated with affinity-purified anti-Thr(P)-787 antibody (1:50) in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 plus 10% normal goat serum for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing five times, the cells were incubated with 1:200 anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunological Laboratory) for 30 min at 37 °C. After five washes, the coverslips were mounted onto slides. The samples were examined using confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad 600 system). Lines with mutations in theeag gene (eag1 andeagsc29 ) were a gift of Barry Ganetzky (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Theeag1 allele encodes a protein with a truncated C terminus 2B. Ganetzky, personal communication. and is a hypomorph, whereas the eagsc29 mutant is a null for the full-length mRNA (13Drysdale R. Warmke J. Kreber R. Ganetzky B. Genetics. 1991; 127: 497-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and there is no detectable full-length protein in head extracts (data not shown). The pan-neural GAL4 driver line C155 (14Lin D.M. Fetter R.D. Kopczynski C. Grenningloh G. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) was used to drive transgene expression in fly neurons. This line contains a GAL4 gene inserted into theelav locus and expresses in all neurons (15Robinow S. White K. Dev. Biol. 1988; 126: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). UAS-CaMKII-T287D was made as described (16Jin P. Griffith L.C. Murphey R.K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8955-8964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This transgene encodes a constitutively active form of Drosophila CaMKII (17Wang Z. Palmer G. Griffith L.C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Canton-S flies were collected and quickly frozen in liquid N2. Heads were separated from bodies with a sizing sieve. Approximately 250 heads were homogenized in the solubilization buffer and spun for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was divided into four aliquots and mixed with CaMKII, phosphorylation assay reagents, and [γ-32P]ATP. Calcium-stimulated activity was measured in an assay reaction containing 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, and 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP. In control reactions, 0.5 mmEGTA was used and CaCl2 and CaM were omitted. CaMKII (R3 isoform) was purified as described from transfected COS cells (18GuptaRoy B. Beckingham K. Griffith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19846-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The reactions were allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 10 min and terminated by adding 200 μl of solubilization buffer and 5 μl of the anti-Eag antibody. Immunoprecipitation was done by rotating tubes for 2 h at 4 °C. The Eag-IgG complex was pulled down with protein A beads. The beads were washed, and proteins were boiled off in SDS sample loading buffer and separated on SDS gels. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Male third instar larvae were immobilized in a chamber cut out on a Sylgard-covered glass slide with insect pins (Fine Science Tool, Inc.) and cut open along their dorsal surface with Aesculap Micro Scissors. Gut and brain were removed. Larval body wall muscles were dissected in low calcium saline (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 128 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 35.5 mm sucrose, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA) and fixed in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Preparations were washed three times (15 min each) with PBT (PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated in 1:50 affinity-purified anti-Thr(P)-787 in PBT overnight at 4 °C, followed by staining with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Cappel, 1:200, 60 min at 37 °C). The samples were washed three times with PBT and mounted using Vectorshield (Vector Laboratories). For expression in Xenopusoocytes, SphI sites flanking the Thr-787 phosphorylation site were used to subclone single-site mutations into the pGH19-eag construct (12Wilson G.F. Wang Z. Chouinard S.W. Griffith L.C. Ganetzky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6389-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmids were linearized usingNotI and capped RNAs transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase according to manufacturer instructions (Message Machine, Ambion). RNA concentrations were quantified with spectrophotometric readings. Stage V-VI oocytes were defolliculated by incubation in Ca2+-free OR2 solution (82.5 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH to 7.6 with NaOH) containing 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma, type 1A) for 1–3 h with gentle agitation. Oocytes were injected with 0.1–0.2 ng of RNA/oocyte and were maintained in L-15 medium (containing: 50% L-15 (Invitrogen), 15 mmHepes, 50 mg/ml gentamycin, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH to 7.4 with NaOH) at 18 °C for 2–5 days. Recordings were performed using a Turbo TEC-10C amplifier (NPI Electronics) and pCLAMP8 software (Axon Instruments). The extracellular recording solution typically contained 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Hepes (pH to 7.1 with NaOH). An extracellular solution high in K+ was used to enhance tail currents during measurements of the voltage dependence of activation; this solution contained 100 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHepes (pH 7.4 with KOH). Pipettes were filled with 2 m KCl and had resistances of 0.3–0.6 megohms. Experiments were performed at room temperature (19–22 °C). Unless otherwise noted, amplitude measurements refer to the peak currents observed during test pulses to the indicated voltages. Activation and inactivation time constants were determined by fitting traces (excluding capacitative transients) with two exponentials and a steady state. Conductance-voltage (G-V) relations were obtained from measurements of instantaneous tails currents. Curves were normalized by the maximum conductance and fit with a Boltzmann distribution. Measurements were statistically compared using unpaired Student'st tests with the Welch correction for unequal variances. CaMKII autoinhibitory peptide (CaMKII inhibitor 281–301, Calbiochem) and lavendustin C (Calbiochem) were dissolved in water and Me2SO, respectively. Equal volumes of the stock solutions or their corresponding buffers were injected using a Nanoject (Drummond) to obtain the final concentrations noted. Oocyte volume was estimated assuming a diameter of 1 mm. Previous work had shown that CaMKII could phosphorylate a bacterially produced fragment of Eagin vitro (7Griffith L.C. Wang J. Zhong Y., Wu, C.F. Greenspan R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10044-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To determine whether native Eag proteins inDrosophila were substrates for CaMKII, we prepared Canton-S fly head extracts. Radioactive ATP, purified CaMKII, Ca2+/CaM, and/or EGTA were added and the mixture incubated for 10 min. After the phosphorylation reaction was complete, Eag was immunoprecipitated. Fig. 1 shows32P incorporation into immunoprecipitated Eag protein visualized by autoradiography. In the presence of Ca2+/CaM and exogenous pure CaMKII, Eag proteins from Canton-S fly heads were phosphorylated. The Eag band was not seen when either Ca2+/CaM or CaMKII or both were absent in the reactions, suggesting that the phosphorylation was Ca2+/CaM- and CaMKII-dependent. Eag is a transmembrane protein with cytoplasmic N and C termini. To localize the site(s) of Eag phosphorylation, we made GST fusion proteins containing both cytoplasmic domains. Fig.2 A shows a schematic diagram of Eag. GST-Eag-N is a 45-kDa fusion protein containing the N terminus of Eag from amino acid 44 to 210. This protein includes three CaMKII consensus sites (RXX(S/T)) at Thr-154, Thr-182, and Ser-188. GST-Eag-C1 is a 54-kDa fusion protein containing the C terminus of Eag from amino acid 556–802. This fusion protein includes three CaMKII consensus sites at Ser-576, Thr-655, and Thr-787. Fig. 2 B shows phosphorylation of GST, GST-Eag-N, and GST-Eag-C1 using purified Drosophila CaMKII, radioactive ATP, and Ca2+/CaM or EGTA. Phosphate incorporation into the fusion protein substrates was assessed by autoradiography. Only the C1 fragment was a substrate. Neither GST alone or GST-Eag-N was able to incorporate phosphate. CaMKII autophosphorylation is not seen on these gels because of the small amount of kinase used in the experiment. To determine which amino acid residues in the Eag C terminus were CaMKII phosphorylation sites, we mutated all three consensus sites of GST-Eag-C1 to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. In vitrophosphorylation assays were carried out using the purified Eag fragments. Fig. 3 A shows the result from one such experiment. When the GST-Eag-C1 (wild type); single mutants S576A, T655A, and T787A; and double mutants T655A/T787A and S576A/T787A were subjected to phosphorylation by CaMKII, only C1-WT, S576A, and T655A were phosphorylated. Because none of the mutant proteins containing T787A were substrates for CaMKII, it suggested that Thr-787 was the major site of CaMKII phosphorylation in the proximal C terminus under these assay conditions. GST-Eag-C2 and GST-Eag-C2-T787A were generated to test the possibility that there were additional sites in the C terminus. GST-Eag-C2 is a 95-kDa fusion protein containing the entire Eag C terminus from 556 to 1175. There are two additional CaMKII consensus sites, Thr-873 and Ser-1041, in this fusion protein compared with Eag-C1. Ser-1041 is also a consensus phosphorylation site for PKA, the only such site in Eag. Fig. 3 B shows CaMKII phosphorylation of GST-Eag-C2 and GST-Eag-C2-T787A proteins. GST-Eag-C2 and its degradation products incorporated phosphate, whereas GST-Eag-C2-T787A was not phosphorylated at all, even at long incubation times. We conclude that Thr-787 of Eag is the only site that is phosphorylated by CaMKII in vitrounder these assay conditions. To allow us to determine whether Thr-787 was a site for CaMKII phosphorylation in the intact channel in vivo, we raised a phosphospecific antibody to this residue. Fig.4 A shows that the affinity-purified antibody recognized the phosphorylated GST-Eag-C2 but not the unphosphorylated form. GST-Eag-C2-T787A was not recognized even after kinase treatment. The mammalian tsA201 cell line has been used to express potassium channel proteins at relatively high levels (19Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar). We used anti-Thr(P)-787 to probe the phosphorylation state of Eag in tsA201 cells, which had been transiently transfected with Myc-tagged Eag-WT or Eag-T787A cDNA. To test the ability of CaMKII to phosphorylate Eag, a cDNA encoding a constitutively active form of CaMKII (CaMKII-T287D) was cotransfected. Eag proteins in cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Eag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4 B). Equal amounts of Eag were precipitated from each cell extract, as shown by Western blots using an antibody that recognizes the Myc epitope tag present on the channel. When the same immunoprecipitations were probed with the anti-Thr(P)-787 phosphospecific antibody, there was a 13-fold increase in the immunoreactivity in cells cotransfected with Eag-WT and CaMKII-T287D, compared with those transfected with Eag-WT alone. The basal signal seen with the wild type alone was probably a result of its phosphorylation by endogenous kinase. We and others (20Wei J. Wayman G. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24231-24235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have observed a low level of CaMKII activity in this cell line. There was no signal detected in cells transfected with the mutant Myc-Eag-T787A, even in the presence of the constitutively active CaMKII. Thr-787 can also be shown to be an in vivo CaMKII site if the anti-Thr(P)-787 antibody is used to directly stain transfected tsA201 cells. For these experiments, cells were transfected with GFP-tagged Eag cDNAs, with or without the constitutively active form of CaMKII. After fixation, cells were stained with the anti-Thr(P)-787 antibody. Confocal images are shown in Fig.5. Images on the left show GFP fluorescence, which represents Eag expression level and localization in these cells. Images of the same field on the right side of Fig. 5 show rhodamine fluorescence, which represents anti-Thr(P)-787 staining. Eag appears to be on plasma membranes as well as in internal membrane compartments, consistent with the fact that Eag is a membrane protein. The pattern of Eag localization does not seem to be altered by the co-expression of CaMKII. When Eag-WT was expressed alone (top panels), some cells showed Thr-787 phosphorylation, which could be attributed to the endogenous CaMKII activity (a finding consistent with Fig. 4 B). When GFP-Eag-WT was co-expressed with CaMKII (middle panels), almost all cells showed rhodamine fluorescence and the signal was stronger than that seen in the top right panel, indicating a higher level of phosphorylation of Eag at Thr-787. When the GFP-Eag-T787A mutant was co-expressed with CaMKII (bottom panels), there was GFP fluorescence but no rhodamine fluorescence. These results confirm that, in tsA201 cells, Eag is phosphorylated at Thr-787 by CaMKII. In addition, these experiments demonstrate that the anti-Thr(P)-787 antiserum gives highly specific cell staining. To determine whether Thr-787 was phosphorylated by CaMKIIin vivo in flies, we employed the DrosophilaGAL4-UAS system to drive overexpression of CaMKII in neurons and probed Eag phosphorylation with the phosphospecific anti-Thr(P)-787 antibody. C155, a GAL4 line that drives expression in the nervous system, was crossed to UAS-CaMKII-T287D (16Jin P. Griffith L.C. Murphey R.K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8955-8964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Male third instar larvae of the progeny from this cross were dissected and their body wall muscles stained with the anti-Thr(P)-787 antibody. To look at basal Eag phosphorylation, we stained male larvae from a cross of C155-GAL4 to Canton S wild type flies. Male eagsc29 larvae (which are null for the full-length eag mRNA 13) and male larvae from a cross of UAS-CaMKII-T287D to C155-GAL4 containing the eag1mutant allele (which deletes the Thr-787 region)2 were also examined. Fig. 6 shows images taken at identical settings of the confocal microscope of larvae processed in tandem. In all pictures, abdominal segment 3, muscles 6 and 7, are shown. Nerve terminals are indicated by arrowheads. Light staining is seen in control (C155-GAL4 X Canton S) animals. The most prominent staining at the nerve terminal is seen in larvae expressing constitutively active CaMKII. This suggests that Eag is expressed in the axon and terminal boutons of larval motor neurons and that phosphorylation is increased by expression of the CaMKII-T287D transgene. There is almost no neuronal signal observed ineagsc29 larvae stained with this antibody, which is not surprising, because this line does not make full-lengtheag mRNA. C155-GAL4 eag1 larvae also show very little staining. These results suggest that anti-Thr(P)-787 antibody is specific for the phosphorylated Thr-787in vivo in the nerve terminals. Staining in the nu"

Recently, chelators have also been explored for their ability to limit oxidant damage in cardiovascular, neurologic, and inflammatory disease as well as to serve as anti-cancer agents. To determine the mechanism of cell death induced by iron chelators, we assessed the time course and pathways of caspase activation during apoptosis induced by iron chelators. We report that the chelator tachpyridine sequentially activates caspases 9, 3, and 8. These caspases were also activated by the structurally unrelated chelators dipyridyl and desferrioxamine. The critical role of caspase activation in cell death was supported by microinjection experiments demonstrating that p35, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, protected HeLa cells from chelator-induced cell death. Apoptosis mediated by tachpyridine was not prevented by blocking the CD95 death receptor pathway with a Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) dominant-negative mutant. In contrast, chelator-mediated cell death was blocked in cells microinjected with Bcl-XL and completely inhibited in cells microinjected with a dominant-negative caspase 9 expression vector. Caspase activation was not observed in cells treated with N-methyl tachpyridine, anN-alkylated derivative of tachpyridine which lacks an ability to react with iron. These results suggest that activation of a mitochondrial caspase pathway is an important mechanism by which iron chelators induce cell death.

However, iron can also promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals through Fenton chemistry. Maintaining iron availability for cellular metabolic and growth requirements is critical to the survival of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The availability of extracellular and intracellular iron can be affected dramatically by iron chelators. Studies of iron chelators have largely focused on their ability to mobilize iron from iron-overloaded patients and tissues (1Galanello R. Semin. Hematol. 2001; 38: 73-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Franchini M. Gandini G. Aprili G. Haematologica. 2000; 85: 1122-1125PubMed Google Scholar). However, the potential uses of chelators extend beyond iron overload. To the extent that chelators prevent the participation of iron in oxygen radical formation, iron chelators may mitigate the oxidative stress damage resulting from ischemia/reperfusion (3Horackova M. Ponka P. Byczko Z. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 47: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), neurodegenerative disease (4Thompson K.J. Shoham S. Connor J.R. Brain Res.

In these settings, chelators are used for their protective cellular and organismal effects. Iron chelators have also been tested for their potential antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects. Desferrioxamine (DFO),1 a bacterial siderophore and the drug of choice in the treatment of iron overload, as well as pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone and related chelators (8Gao J. Richardson D.R. Blood. 2001; 98: 842-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the 8-hydroxyquinoline-based chelator O-Trensox (9Rakba N. Loyer P. Gilot D. Delcros J.G. Glaise D. Baret P. Pierre J.L.

Blood. 1998; 92: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are actively being explored for their cytotoxic and cytolytic properties. Iron chelators can induce both cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Thus, treatment of activated T lymphocytes and HL-60 cells with the iron chelators deferiprone or DFO induced apoptosis (11Hileti D. Panayiotidis P. Hoffbrand A.V. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 89: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The human leukemic cell line CCRF-CEM treated with DFO exhibited morphological features of apoptosis after 48 h (12Haq R.U. Wereley J.P. Chitambar C.R. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 428-432PubMed Google Scholar). The iron chelators DFO, dithizone, and hinokitol induced apoptosis in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells (13Ido Y. Muto N. Inada A. Kohroki M. Mano M. Odani T. Itoh N. Yamamoto K. Tanaka K. Cell Prolif. 1999; 32: 63-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the chelator O-Trensox induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells (9Rakba N.

Treatment of a mouse B cell lymphoma cell line 38C13 with either monoclonal antibodies against the transferrin receptor, DFO, or a defined culture medium without supplemental iron (iron-poor medium), showed that these cells died by apoptosis (14Kovar J. Stunz L.L. Stewart B.C. Kriegerbeckova K. Ashman R.F. Kemp J.D. Pathobiology. 1997; 65: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, iron chelation has been shown to induce apoptosis in Kaposi's sarcoma cells (15Simonart T. Degraef C. Andrei G. Mosselmans R. Hermans P. Vooren J.-P.V. Noel J.-C. Boelaert J.R. Snoeck R. Heenen M. Society Invest. Derm. 2000; 115: 893-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and neuroblastoma cells (16Fan L. Iyer J. Zhu S. Frick K.K. Wada R.K. Eskenazi A.E. Berg P.E. Ikegaki N. Kennett R.H. Frantz C.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1073-1079PubMed Google Scholar). Our group has synthesized and describedN,N′,N′′-tris(2-pyridylmethyl)-cis,cis-1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane (tachpyridine) (10Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Whitman S.P. Brechbiel M.W. Park G. Planalp R.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bowen T. Planalp R.P. Brechbiel M.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Chem. 1998; 3: 449-457Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Tachpyridine is a hexadentate chelator that binds metals through six nitrogen donor ligands. Both tachpyridine and DFO can repress synthesis of the iron-binding protein ferritin, the synthesis of which is critically dependent upon intracellular iron, suggesting that these two chelators share a similar ability to deplete intracellular iron pools (10Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Whitman S.P. Brechbiel M.W. Park G. Planalp R.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rogers J. Munro H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2277-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that tachpyridine is cytotoxic because of its ability to bind one or more of the metals iron, zinc, or copper, because complexes of tachpyridine with these metals (but not others) are nontoxic (10Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Whitman S.P. Brechbiel M.W. Park G. Planalp R.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BecauseN-alkylated derivatives of tachpyridine which are sterically hindered in their ability to react with iron are no longer toxic (10Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Whitman S.P. Brechbiel M.W. Park G. Planalp R.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have speculated that iron deprivation is an important component of the toxicity of tachpyridine (10Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Whitman S.P. Brechbiel M.W. Park G. Planalp R.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tachpyridine induces an apoptotic mode of cell death which is p53-independent (20Abeysinghe R.D. Greene B.T. Haynes R. Willingham M.C. Turner J. Planalp R.P. Brechbiel M.W. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of apoptosis mediated by iron chelators are poorly understood. The experiments described here were designed to determine the molecular pathway utilized by iron chelators to induce apoptosis. In particular, we asked whether chelators engage elements of one or both of two well studied apoptotic pathways. The first of these is the death receptor pathway, originally characterized following binding of ligands to extracellular death receptors such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, CD95/Fas and DR5 (for review, see Ref. 21Wilson M.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Binding of ligands to these receptors triggers oligomerization and recruits proteins such as TRADD and FADD/Mort-1 to associate with the complex through their death domains. Activated death receptors in turn recruit and activate caspase 8, a cysteine protease that initiates a cascade of terminal or “executioner” caspases, including caspase 3 and others. Unleashing of executioner caspases results in cleavage of a number of caspase substrates, including protein kinases, cytoskeleton-associated proteins, transcription factors, and proteins involved in DNA repair and chromatin structure such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). A second pathway that leads to apoptosis is the activation of caspases via a mitochondrial mechanism (for review, see Ref. 21Wilson M.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial participation in apoptosis is characterized by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. Released cytochrome c forms a complex with procaspase 9 and Apaf-1. In this “apoptosome,” procaspase 9 becomes activated, triggers executioner caspases, and initiates terminal events that overlap with those initiated by death receptors. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is modulated by members of the Bcl-2 family, proteins that localize to the cytosolic aspect of membranes, including mitochondrial membranes. Members of this family include the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL as well as the pro-apoptotic protein bax (for review, see Ref.22Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL prevents cytochrome c release and the mitochondrial permeability transition and promotes cell survival (22Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). We report that tachpyridine, DFO, and dipyridyl activate a caspase cascade. Induction of apoptosis by tachpyridine is characterized by an early activation of caspase 9 followed by the sequential activation of caspase 3 and caspase 8. Further, chelator-mediated cell death can be blocked by a dominant-negative caspase 9 and Bcl-XL overexpression. These results indicate that the mitochondrial pathway makes an important contribution to iron chelator-mediated cell death. The human cervical cancer cell line HeLa was obtained from the tissue culture core laboratory (Comprehensive Cancer Center of WFUSM). HeLa cells stably transfected with a pGFP-ΔFADD (dominant-negative mutant) expression vector or pGFP control vector were kindly provided by Dr. Harald Wajant (University of Stutttgart, Stuttgart, Germany). All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin), in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For all experiments, cells were seeded at appropriate concentrations to ensure exponential growth. Tachpyridine was synthesized from cis-1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane as its nitrate salt according to methods published previously (17Bowen T. Planalp R.P. Brechbiel M.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 807-809Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Park G., Lu, F.H., Ye, N. Brechbiel M.W. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Planalp R.P. J. Biol. Inorgan. Chem. 1998; 3: 449-457Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The identity of tachpyridine was confirmed by1H,13C NMR as described (17Bowen T. Planalp R.P. Brechbiel M.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 807-809Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and was >99% pure. The compound was prepared as a 1 mm stock in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, 0.22 μm filter sterilized, and stored at 4 °C. Appropriate volumes were added from this stock to cell cultures. DFO was obtained from Sigma, and on the day of the experiment, it was prepared as a 50 mm stock in complete medium, filter sterilized, and added to cultures from this stock. Etoposide and 2′,2′-dipyridyl were obtained from Sigma, and on the day of the experiment, they were prepared as a 50 mmstock in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to cultures from this stock. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was 0.4% or less. Dimethyl sulfoxide at these concentrations did not result in caspase activation (not shown). Cycloheximide was obtained from Sigma and was prepared as 1 mg/ml stock in 95% ethanol and stored at −20 °C. TNF-α was obtained from R & D Systems (Oxon, UK), prepared as a 10 ng/μl stock in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and stored at −80 °C. The pΔcaspase9 (dominant-negative mutant) expression vector, which contains an active site mutation (Cys-287 → Ala) (23Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Dr. Dale E. Bredesen (Buck Institute for Age Research, Novato, CA). The yellow fluorescent protein (pYFP C1) expression vector was from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The pBcl-XL and pcDNA3.1 expression vectors were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The baculovirus p35 expression vector was from Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA). HeLa cells were plated onto T-25 flasks (Corning, Cambridge, MA) and allowed to attach overnight. Chelator was added, and cells were placed in dedicated incubator of an inverted phase contrast video microscope (Axiovert, Zeiss) for observation. A cell was considered to have entered apoptosis at the first appearance of cell shrinkage and membrane blebs, morphological hallmarks of apoptosis (24Willingham M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Treated or control cells were harvested by scraping into medium, washed in ice-cold PBS, and pellets were frozen until analysis. For caspase blots, pellets were suspended in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5.0 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), including phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mg/ml), and sonicated for 15 s. Aliquots representing equal amounts of protein from each lysate were separated on a 12 or 16% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a rabbit anti-human caspase 3 polyclonal antibody (Stressgene, San Diego, CA), a mouse anti-human caspase 9 monoclonal antibody (Stressgene), or a rabbit anti-human caspase 8 polyclonal antibody (PharMingen, San Diego). For Western blot analysis of PARP cleavage, pellets were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris·Cl, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.00125% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol), sonicated for 15 s, and then incubated at 65 °C for 15 min. Lysates representing equal numbers of cells were then loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using mouse anti-PARP monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA). Primary antibodies were detected using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemoluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Equivalent loading and protein transfer were confirmed by Western blot using a mouse anti-human β-actin antibody (Sigma) and by staining membranes with Ponceau S (Sigma). For quantitation, Western blots were prepared with an internal standard curve consisting of three dilutions of a sample of cleaved caspase; densitometric analyses of these standards were linear with dilution (correlation coefficient r = 1.0, 0.96, and 0.99 for caspase 9, 3, and 8, respectively). Signal intensities were quantitated using the ChemiImager 5500 and AlphaEase FC software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Signal intensities for experimental samples fell within the range of the standard curve. Enzymatic assays were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Treated or control cells were harvested by scraping into medium, washed in ice-cold PBS, and pellets were frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Pellets were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer obtained from Alexis (San Diego), placed on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 100 μg of protein was diluted in 50 μl of lysis buffer and added to 40 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol). 10 μl of the appropriate caspase substrate was then added to give a final concentration of 100 μm. The plates were incubated for 3 h in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The substrates for each caspase were as follows: Ac-DEVD-pNA for caspase 3-like activity (Alexis), Ac-LEHD-AFC (Calbiochem) for caspase 9 activity, and Z-IETD-AFC (Calbiochem) for caspase 8 activity. These substrates are preferentially but not exclusively cleaved by the indicated caspases (25Henning R.S. Salvesen G.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 91-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrates were prepared as 1 mm stocks according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at −20 °C. Levels of released p-nitroanilide (pNA) were measured by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. Alternatively, levels of released 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AFC) were measured using excitation at 420 nm and emission at 517 nm. 500,000 HeLa pGFP-ΔFADD or pGFP control cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes (Becton-Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and allowed to attach overnight. The next day, plates were treated with 25 μm tachpyridine, 100 μm etoposide, or 100 ng/ml TNF-α plus 2.5 μg/ml cycloheximide. At this time, untreated (control) plates of cells were counted using trypan blue exclusion to determine the number of cells at time of treatment. After various time intervals, treated plates were counted by trypan blue exclusion, and percent survival relative to untreated (control) was determined. HeLa cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes (Becton-Dickinson Labware) and allowed to attach overnight. The next day, expression plasmids at 200 ng/μl (pYFP C1) or 250 ng/μl (Bcl-XL, p35, pcDNA3.1, pΔcaspase9) were injected into the cell nucleus using an Eppendorf microinjector, according to methods published previously (26Morgan M.J. Thorburn J. Thomas L. Maxwell T. Brothman A.R. Thorburn A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For each dish, pYFP C1 was either coinjected with the control plasmid (pcDNA3.1, control) or coinjected with cDNA encoding the protein of interest (Bcl-XL, p35, pΔcaspase9, test plasmid). Cells that had been microinjected successfully were identified by the fluorescence of the YFP protein using an Axiovert S100 fluorescent microscope and 450–490/515–565 nm excitation/emission filters. To quantitate cell survival, cells were visualized and counted 4–5 h after injection. The medium was then replaced with either control medium or medium containing drug, and incubation was continued for an additional 12 h for TNF/cycloheximide or 24 h for tachpyridine and etoposide. Percent survival of cells injected with the control plasmid or the test plasmid was determined by counting the number of surviving cells for each after treatment and dividing this number by the number of initial cells obtained from counting 4–5 h after injection. In most cases, 50–120 cells/dish/plasmid(s) were microinjected in each experiment. HeLa cells were seeded onto 35-mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The next day, control medium or medium containing drug was added, and cells were treated for the appropriate time. After treatment, nonadherent cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C (untreated control cells remained adherent). The pellet was washed in PBS, resuspended in PBS, and plated onto 35-mm dishes coated with 1 mg/ml polylysine. For staining, both adherent (control) and nonadherent (drug-treated) cells were fixed in 10% formalin in PBS at room temperature for 10 min and then rinsed with PBS. 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS was added at room temperature for 10 min, and plates were then rinsed again with PBS. Blocking was performed using 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 10 min followed by incubation with an antibody that reacts selectively with activated caspase 3 (rabbit anti-human caspase 3 antibody, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) (27Joza N. Susin S.A. Daugas E. Stanford W.L. Cho S.K., Li, C.Y.J. Sasaki T. Elia A.J. Cheng H.-Y.M. Ravagnan L. Ferri K.F. Zamzami N. Wakeham A. Hakem R. Yoshida H. Kong Y.-Y. Mak T.W. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Kroemer G. Penninger J. Nature. 2001; 410: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) in 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 30 min. Plates were washed with PBS and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at room temperature for 30 min. After washing in PBS, plates were fixed again in 10% formalin at room temperature for 10 min. DAPI in methanol was then added for 5 min, plates were washed with methanol and PBS and then visualized using fluorescence microscopy. Using a number of criteria, including membrane blebbing and blistering as visualized by time lapse video microscopy, terminal nucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays, chromatin condensation, and internucleosomal cleavage of DNA, we have shown previously that the iron chelator tachpyridine induces an apoptotic mode of cell death (20Abeysinghe R.D. Greene B.T. Haynes R. Willingham M.C. Turner J. Planalp R.P. Brechbiel M.W. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To begin to explore molecular pathways utilized by tachpyridine to induce apoptosis, we first asked whether members of the cysteine protease family of caspases were involved. For these experiments we used HeLa cells, a cell line in which pathways of caspase activation in response to numerous agents, including chemotherapeutic drugs and death receptor ligands such as TNF, have been extensively characterized. Time lapse video microscopy indicated that these cells, like MCF7 and H1299 cells we have studied previously, undergo an apoptotic mode of cell death when treated with tachpyridine (Fig. 1). Initially, we examined whether the caspase substrate PARP was cleaved in HeLa cells treated with 25 μm tachpyridine (Fig.2). As a positive control, HeLa cells were also treated with 100 μm etoposide, a DNA-damaging agent known to induce apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 2, Western blotting revealed that 25 μm tachpyridine induced discernible cleavage of PARP by 16 h, with more extensive cleavage of PARP at 18 h and beyond (Fig. 2).Figure 2Tachpyridine induces PARP cleavage. HeLa cells were treated with 25 μm tachpyridine or 100 μm etoposide (VP) for the indicated times. Protein extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting with an anti-PARP antibody was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Arrows point to uncleaved (115 kDa) and cleaved (85 kDa) forms of PARP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given that tachpyridine induced PARP cleavage, we next assessed activation of the “effector” caspase, caspase 3. Activation of caspase 3 was measured by its conversion from a 32-kDa zymogen to an active enzyme of 17 and 20 kDa using Western blotting. As a positive control, HeLa cells were treated with 100 μm etoposide for 48 h. As seen in Fig. 3, treatment of HeLa cells with 25 μm tachpyridine caused minor cleavage of caspase 3 by 14 h (Fig. 3). Pronounced cleavage of caspase 3 was seen after 16 h, and active caspase 3 continued to increase throughout the 30-h time course (Fig. 3). (Decreased sensitivity of the Western blot assay relative to the single cell morphological assay shown in Fig. 1 likely accounts for the slightly different kinetics in Figs. 1 and 3.) As expected, the appearance of the cleavage product was accompanied by a gradual loss of the zymogen precursor. To date, two major “initiator” caspases have been described which result in the activation of effector caspases such as caspase 3: caspase 8, triggered by binding of ligands to death receptors, and caspase 9, activated by a mitochondrial pathway (21Wilson M.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To test whether either of these pathways was activated in chelator-treated cells, we used Western blotting to assess activation of caspases 9 and 8 in HeLa cells treated with 25 μm tachpyridine (Fig. 3). As a positive control for caspase 8 activation, HeLa cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TNF-α in the presence of 1 μg/ml cycloheximide for 4 h; treatment with 100 μm etoposide for 48 h was used as a positive control for caspase 9 activation (Fig. 3). As seen in Fig. 3, caspase 9 was activated as early as 10 h, consistent with the early recruitment of a mitochondrial pathway in tachpyridine-mediated apoptosis. Caspase 8 was also activated in tachpyridine-treated cells; however, activation of caspase 8 was delayed relative to the activation of both caspase 9 and caspase 3, and substantial activation of caspase 8 was not observed until 30 h (Fig. 3). To confirm activation of caspase 9, 3, and 8 in chelator-treated cells, we used enzymatic assays to measure cleavage of caspase substrates by extracts prepared from control and treated cells. Cells were incubated with either 100 μm etoposide as a positive control for caspase 3-like and caspase 9 activity or with 50 ng/ml TNF-α in the presence of 1 μg/ml cycloheximide as a positive control for caspase 8 activity. As shown in Fig. 4, enzymatic activity of all three caspases rose after treatment with tachpyridine; the increase in activity was comparable with that induced by treatment with etoposide or TNF. These results demonstrate that caspase zymogens are both cleaved and enzymatically activated in response to tachpyridine. To verify that induction of caspases by tachpyridine was related to its metal binding properties rather than some other feature of the molecule, we treated HeLa cells with anN-alkylated derivative of tachpyridine which lacks an ability to react with iron and is no longer toxic (10Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Whitman S.P. Brechbiel M.W. Park G. Planalp R.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of all caspases (3, 9, and 8) was completely absent in cells treated with this N-alkylated derivative (Fig.5). These results indicate that activation of caspases by tachpyridine is dependent on its metal binding ability. To determine whether caspase activation is a general feature of iron chelator-mediated apoptosis, we treated cells with dipyridyl and DFO, two structurally unrelated iron chelators that are chemically distinct from tachpyridine.

https://openalex.org/W2079102374,"NCAM plays a key role in neural development and plasticity-mediating cell adhesion and differentiation mainly through homophilic binding. Until recently, attempts to modulate neuronal differentiation and plasticity through NCAM have been impeded by the absence of small synthetic agonists mimicking homophilic interactions of NCAM. We show here that a peptide, P2, corresponding to a 12-amino acid sequence localized in the FG loop of the second Ig module of NCAM, binds to the first Ig module, which is the natural binding partner of the second Ig module, with an apparent K d of 4.7 ± 0.9 × 10−6m. P2 inhibits cell aggregation and induces neurite outgrowth from hippocampal neurons, maximal neuritogenic effect being obtained at a concentration of 0.8 μm. The neuritogenic effect was inhibited by preincubation of P2 with the recombinant NCAM-IgI. Both the length of P2 and the basic amino acid residues at the N and C termini are important for its neuritogenic activity. Treatment of hippocampal cultures with P2 results in induction of phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2. Thus, P2 is a potent mimetic of NCAM, and therefore, an attractive compound for the development of drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

NCAM is primarily expressed in neurons, glial cells, and skeletal muscle. Alternative splicing of mRNA transcribed from a single gene generates three major NCAM isoforms: NCAM-A (180 kDa), NCAM-B (140 kDa), and NCAM-C (120 kDa). These isoforms have identical extracellular parts consisting of five N-terminal Ig-like modules (IgI–IgV) followed by two fibronectin type III modules (1Berezin V. Bock E. Poulsen F.M. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2000; 3: 605-609PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane isoforms, NCAM-A and NCAM-B, have intracellular parts of different sizes, whereas NCAM-C is linked to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. NCAM is known to mediate Ca2+-independent cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion via homophilic (NCAM binding to NCAM) and heterophilic (e.g.NCAM binding to heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans) interactions, respectively (2Cole G.J. Akeson R. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1157-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 3Nybroe O. Moran N. Bock E. J.

NCAM homophilic binding was originally reported to depend on a reciprocal interaction involving IgIII modules of two opposing NCAM molecules (5Rao Y., Wu, X.-F. Gariepy J. Rutishauser U. Siu C.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 937-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6Rao Y. Zhao X., Wu, X.-F. Yip P. Gariepy J. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20630-20638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, an interaction involving all five Ig modules was also suggested (7Ranheim T.S. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4071-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A double reciprocal binding between the recombinant IgI and IgII modules was demonstrated by means of surface plasmon resonance analysis (8Kiselyov V.V. Berezin V. Maar T. Soroka V. Edvardsen K. Schousboe A. Bock E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10125-10134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and recently, the three-dimensional structure of the IgI and IgII modules of rat NCAM was determined by both NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography, resulting in the identification of homophilic binding sites in the IgI and IgII modules (9Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Thomsen N.K. Ralets I. Berezin V. Bock E. Poulsen F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Kasper C. Rasmussen H. Kastrup J.S. Ikemizu S. Jones E.Y. Berezin V. Bock E. Kjøller-Larsen I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Neurons have been shown to respond with an increased neurite outgrowth to both glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked and transmembrane isoforms of NCAM expressed on the surface of non-neuronal cells (11Doherty P. Barton C.H. Dicson G. Seaton P. Rowett L.H. Moore S.E. Gower H.J. Walsh F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NCAM homophilic binding has been suggested to activate the fibroblast growth factor receptor-signaling pathway (12Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 13Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 99-111Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and recently, the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras-MAPK) signaling pathway has also been implicated in NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth (14Schmid R.S. Graff R.D. Schaller M.D. Chen S. Schachner M. Hemperly J.J. Maness P. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 38: 542-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 15Kolkova K. Novitskaya V. Pedersen N. Berezin V. Bock E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2238-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the IgII module of NCAM has been identified as a natural ligand of the IgI module (8Kiselyov V.V. Berezin V. Maar T. Soroka V. Edvardsen K. Schousboe A. Bock E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10125-10134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and shown to induce NCAM-specific neurite outgrowth (16Rønn L.C. Olsen M. Ostergaard S. Kiselyov V. Berezin V. Mortensen M.T. Lerche M.H. Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Saffells J.L. Doherty P. Poulsen F.M. Bock E. Holm A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to design a putative peptide ligand of NCAM based on our knowledge of the structure of the homophilic binding site localized in IgII. In this study, we demonstrate that a peptide corresponding to a 12-amino acid sequence of the FG loop of the second Ig module of NCAM binds to the first Ig module, inhibits cell aggregation, activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and stimulates neurite outgrowth in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. Thus, based on current knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of homophilic binding sites in NCAM, we have identified a small peptide mimetic of NCAM with strong neuritogenic activity. This approach not only opens up new possibilities in studying the role of NCAM in neuronal differentiation and plasticity but may also allow the development of new tools potentially useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Rabbit anti-rat GAP-43 antibodies were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Peptides were synthesized using the Fmoc protection strategy on TentaGel resin (Rapp Polymere, Tübingen, Germany) using Fmoc- (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) protected amino acids. Dendrimers were composed of four monomers coupled to a lysine backbone. All concentrations of the P2 and C3 dendrimers (P2d and C3d, respectively) were calculated based on the amount of monomers. Peptides were at least 95% pure as estimated by high performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (VG TOF Spec E, Fisons Instruments, Beverly, MA). The IgI (residues 20–116) and IgII (residues 119–209) modules of rat NCAM (NCBI accession number NP_113709) were produced as recombinant proteins in the P. pastoris yeast expression system as described previously (9Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Thomsen N.K. Ralets I. Berezin V. Bock E. Poulsen F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Thomsen N.K. Soroka V. Jensen P.H. Berezin V. Bock E. Poulsen F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The authenticity of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the corresponding plasmids, by amino acid sequencing of the first 10–12 N-terminal residues, and by confirming the expected molecular weight by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. The purity of the recombinant proteins was at least 95%, as estimated by SDS-PAGE. Folding of the recombinant IgI and IgII modules was established by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra. Real time biomolecular interaction (surface plasmon resonance) analysis was performed using the BIAcore-X instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as follows: 4000 resonance units of P2 peptide dendrimers were immobilized noncovalently on a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore AB) by electrostatic preconcentration. Binding of the recombinant IgI and IgII modules of NCAM in the 12.5–100 μm concentration range was measured at 25 °C in HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20 (Biacore AB)) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. After each binding cycle, the sensor chip was regenerated by three 8-μl injections of 50 mm NaOH. Data were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting using the BIAevaluation software, version 2.2.4 (Biacore AB). Models of single-site binding association and dissociation were used to derive the apparent association and dissociation rate constants. Three independent experiments were performed. Hippocampi were isolated from Wistar rat embryos at gestational day 18, and dissociated cells were obtained as described previously (18Maar T. Moran J. Schousboe A. Pasantes-Morales H. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 5: 491-502Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated hippocampal tissue was homogenized, trypsinized, and incubated in the presence of DNase I (Sigma) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). For microwell aggregation cultures, cells were seeded in 60-well microtiter plates (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) at a density of 50,000 cells/well in a volume of 15 μl. For low density cultures, dissociated neurons were seeded in 8-well LabTek coverslides (NUNC) at a density of 5000 cells/cm2. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). The recombinant Ig modules of NCAM and synthetic peptides were added to the medium immediately after plating. Microwell aggregation cultures and coverslides were examined under a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope using Nikon Plan ×20 phase-contrast optics. Video recordings were made with a Videotech video camera (Grundig Electronics, Germany). 768 × 576 pixel images were stored using the PRIGRA software package (Protein Laboratory, University of Copenhagen). To evaluate the effect of synthetic peptides and the recombinant IgII module on aggregation of the high density microwell cultures of primary hippocampal neurons, the number of aggregates in each well was counted 24 h after plating. To evaluate the length of processes of hippocampal neurons, low density cultures in LabTek coverslides were fixed in 4% w/v paraformaldehyde for 15 min, stained with Coomassie Blue R250 (4 g/liter in 45% v/v ethanol and 45% v/v acetic acid) for 20 min, and recorded 24 h after plating. By means of the ProcessLength software package (Protein Laboratory, University of Copenhagen), an unbiased counting frame containing a grid with a user-defined number of test lines was superimposed on images of the cell cultures. The number of intersections of cellular processes with the test lines was counted and related to the number of cell bodies, thereby allowing quantification of the total neurite length per cell (19Rønn L.C. Ralets I. Hartz B. Beck M. Berezin A. Berezin V. Møller A. Bock E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 100: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Between 150 and 250 cells were analyzed in each group in each individual experiment. The average neurite length of control, untreated neurons was 9 μm/cell. Hippocampal cultures were rinsed in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 mNaH2PO4, 50 mm sucrose, 0.4 mm CaCl2, pH 7.1), fixed in 4% w/v paraformaldehyde in sodium phosphate buffer for 30 min at room temperature, blocked with 10% v/v normal goat serum in 1% w/v bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% w/v bovine serum albumin and 0.2% w/v saponin. Neurons were subsequently incubated with rabbit anti-rat GAP-43 polyclonal antibodies diluted 1:1000 for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:100 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Slides were mounted using Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes) and scanned with a MultiProbe 2010 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an argon/krypton laser (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and an oil immersion ×60 objective, 1.4 NA (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Hippocampal neurons were seeded in 60-mm tissue culture dishes and grown for 6 h in Neurobasal medium. Cells were treated with peptides for 15, 30, and 60 min. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (15Kolkova K. Novitskaya V. Pedersen N. Berezin V. Bock E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2238-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20 and 5% w/v non-fat dry milk and incubated overnight with PhosphoPlus p42/44 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) diluted 1:1000 in TBS. After washing in TBS, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate diluted 1:2000 in TBS containing 5% w/v non-fat dry milk. The membrane was washed again in TBS, and bound secondary antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). To estimate the total amounts of ERK1 and ERK2, the membrane was stripped with 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS in 62.5 mm Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, for 30 min at 60 °C and reprobed with anti-MAP kinase antibody (p42/p44 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody kit from New England Biolabs). The exposed x-ray films were scanned and quantified using the PrAverB image analysis software (Protein Laboratory, University of Copenhagen). Statistics and graphical presentations were carried out using the Fig-P version 2.2 software package (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Statistical evaluations were performed using a two-sided Student's t test. Unless stated otherwise, the results are given as mean ± S.E. We synthesized a peptide, termed P2, whose sequence, GRILARGEINFK, corresponds to residues Gly172–Lys183 of human, rat, mouse, and chicken NCAM, spanning the C-terminal part of the F β-strand, the F-G β-hairpin turn, and the N-terminal part of the G β-strand of the IgII module (Fig.1). IgII has been shown to bind to the IgI module of NCAM (8Kiselyov V.V. Berezin V. Maar T. Soroka V. Edvardsen K. Schousboe A. Bock E. J. Biol.

Since the P2 peptide corresponds to the homophilic binding sequence of the IgII module of NCAM, we tested the ability of P2 to bind to the recombinant IgI module by employing surface plasmon resonance analysis.

Association and dissociation of IgI at different concentrations to immobilized P2d are shown in Fig.2. P2d bound the IgI module of NCAM with an apparent dissociation constant (K d ) of 4.7 ± 0.9 × 10−6m and the apparent association rate (k a ) and dissociation rate (k d ) constants of 8.1 ± 0.9 × 102m−1S−1 and 2.9 ± 0.2 × 10−3m−1S−1, respectively. No binding to immobilized P2d of the IgII module of NCAM was detected.Figure 2Surface plasmon resonance analysis of the binding between the immobilized P2 peptide dendrimer and the soluble recombinant IgI or IgII modules of NCAM.

To test whether P2 also could affect cell-cell adhesion, hippocampal neurons were seeded at high density (50,000 cells/well) in microwell dishes allowing formation of large aggregates during 24 h (18Maar T. Moran J. Schousboe A. Pasantes-Morales H. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 5: 491-502Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, it can be seen that treatment with the monomeric form of the P2 peptide (P2m) caused an increase in the number of aggregates in a dose-dependent manner. In P2-treated cultures, aggregates were smaller than those in control cultures, indicating that P2m as well as IgII inhibit intercellular adhesion, although P2m was 10 times less potent than the recombinant IgII module. Thus, the P2 peptide inhibited aggregation of hippocampal neurons, presumably by binding to the first IgI module, thereby interfering with homophilic NCAM binding. Previously, it has been shown that the IgII module of NCAM stimulates neurite outgrowth at a concentration of 1 μm (16Rønn L.C. Olsen M. Ostergaard S. Kiselyov V. Berezin V. Mortensen M.T. Lerche M.H. Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Saffells J.L. Doherty P. Poulsen F.M. Bock E. Holm A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To test whether P2 also could induce neurite outgrowth, hippocampal neurons were grown in serum-free medium at a low density, precluding cell-cell adhesion. In untreated cultures, hippocampal neurons do not differentiate, as reflected by the extension of no or very short processes (Fig.4 A). However, when hippocampal neurons were treated with the dendrimeric form of P2, P2d, sprouting was observed already 8 h after plating (Fig. 4 B), and the extension of long neurites took place within the first 24 h (Fig. 4 C). After 4 days, outgrowth of multiple branching neuronal processes (neurites) was observed (Fig. 4 D). In Fig. 5 A, it can be seen that treatment of hippocampal neurons with various concentrations of P2d for 24 h induced a neuritogenic response, the maximal stimulation being observed at 0.8 μm P2d. A control peptide, a scrambled version of P2 (NLFEKGRRAIGI, scrP2d), was also synthesized as a dendrimer and tested. Incubation with scrP2d in the same concentrations as P2d had no effect on neurite outgrowth. Fig.5 B shows that a single application of P2d (at the moment of seeding) also stimulated neurite outgrowth with a bell-shaped dose-response relationship at 2, 3, 4, and 7 days after plating, maximal stimulation at all times being observed at a concentration of 0.8 μm P2d. The monomeric form of P2 also stimulated neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown), however, with a potency 180 and 150 times lower than that of P2d and the recombinant IgII module of NCAM, respectively. Thus, P2 induces neurite outgrowth from single hippocampal neurons, probably via binding to the first IgI module, thereby mimicking homophilic NCAM interaction.Figure 5Effect of the dendrimeric form of the P2 peptide ( P2d ) on neurite outgrowth from rat hippocampal neurons (time and dose response). The average length of neurites in cultures is given in μm. Four independent experiments were performed at each concentration and each time point. Results are given as mean ± S.E. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 (as compared with the average length of neurites in control cultures).

Rat hippocampal neurons treated with P2d at various concentrations for 2 (●), 3 (▴), 4 (▾), and 7 (♦) days (B). Treatment with P2d at a peptide concentration of 4 μm for 2, 3, 4, and 7 days also resulted in statistically significant increases in neurite outgrowth with p < 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also tested whether repetitive addition of P2d 24 h after cell seeding could further increase the neuritogenic response. Hippocampal neurons were plated at a low density, P2d was applied in three different concentrations (0.8, 4, and 12 μm) at the time of plating and after 24 h, and cultures were fixed 48 h following plating. In Fig.6, it can be seen that the readdition of P2 after 24 h in all tested concentrations was without effect on neurite outgrowth induced by P2 applied during plating, suggesting that P2, by binding to the IgI module of NCAM, may act as a trigger in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades, leading to neuronal differentiation. When this process has been initiated, no further activation seems to be needed. Since P2 binds to the IgI module of NCAM, we tested whether the neuritogenic effect of the peptide could be abrogated by incubation of the peptide with the recombinant IgI module. IgI in itself has no stimulatory effect on neurite outgrowth (16Rønn L.C. Olsen M. Ostergaard S. Kiselyov V. Berezin V. Mortensen M.T. Lerche M.H. Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Saffells J.L. Doherty P. Poulsen F.M. Bock E. Holm A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In Fig. 7, it can be seen that preincubation of P2d with IgI for 30 min before addition to cell culture inhibited the neuritogenic activity of the peptide in a dose-dependent manner. A statistically significant reduction of the neuritogenic effect of P2d was observed at [IgI]/[P2d] ratios of 8/1 and 16/1. The P2d binding to the recombinant IgI module of NCAM was determined by plasmon surface resonance analysis to have a K d of 4.7 ± 0.9 × 10−6m. Presuming that the binding of P2d to IgI is described by simple first-order kinetics, we calculated the concentration of free P2d in solution in the presence of IgI. By definition of the dissociation constant, the concentration of P2d is as shown in Equation 1,[P2d]=Kd[P2dIgI][IgI]Equation 1 where [P2d] is the molar concentration of the binding sites of P2d peptide, [IgI] is the molar concentration of the IgI module, and [P2dIgI] is the molar concentration of the P2d-IgI complex. Defining the concentration of P2d and IgI at t = 0 as [P2d]0 and [IgI]0, respectively, we obtain [P2dIgI] = [P2d]0 − [P2d] = [IgI]0 − [IgI]. Therefore, as shown in Equation 2,[P2d]=Kd[P2d]0−[P2d][IgI]0−[P2d]0+[P2d]Equation 2 The solutions S 1, S 2of this equation are shown in Equations 3 and 4.S1=12(−([IgI0]+Kd−[P2d0])Equation 3 +([IgI0]+Kd−[P2d0])2+4Kd[P2d0])S2=12(−([IgI0]+Kd−[P2d0])Equation 4 −([IgI0]+Kd−[P2d0])2+4Kd[P2d0])Given that [IgI]0,K d , and [P2d]0 are greater than or equal to 0, S 2 < 0 for all parameter values. Since [P2d] must be greater than 0 by definition, a single solution of Equation 2 is obtained in Equation 5,S1=12(−([IgI]0+Kd−[P2d]0)Equation 5 +([IgI]0+Kd−[P2d]0)2+4Kd[P2d]0)Thus, the molar concentration of free P2d is as shown in Equation 6,[P2d]free=[P2d]n=12n−([IgI]0+Kd−[P2d]0)+([IgI]0+Kd−[P2d]0)2+4Kd[P2d]0Equation 6 where n is the number of IgI binding sites on a single P2d molecule. Since P2d has four potential binding sites for IgI, the value of n varies from 1 to 4. Provided thatK d = 4.7 μm, [IgI]0 = 0.9 μm, [P2d 0] = n × 0.8 μm, n = 1 or 4, and using Equation 6, we calculated [P2d]free as a function of the [IgI]/[P2d] ratio (Fig.8). From Fig. 7, it can be seen that IgI inhibited the P2d-induced neurite outgrowth at [IgI]/[P2d] molar ratios of 8/1 and 16/1. From Fig. 8, we find that at [IgI]/[P2d] = 16/1, the concentration of free P2d approaches 0.2 μm. This is in a good agreement with the results of the P2d-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 5 B), which shows statistically significant (p < 0.001) reduction in neurite length at a concentration of 0.2 μm of P2d as compared with neurite outgrowth observed when using 0.8 μm P2d. This supports the suggestion that the P2 peptide exerts its neuritogenic effect via binding to the first module of NCAM expressed on the surface of neurons. To analyze the contribution of individual amino acid residues to the neuritogenic effect of P2, single amino acid residues in P2m were systematically replaced with alanine residues. In Fig. 9, it is seen that none of the single amino acid substitutions resulted in a statistically significant reduction of the neuritogenic effect of P2m. Interestingly, substitutions of Arg2 or Ile3 with alanine each resulted in a statistically significant increase of the neuritogenic activity of P2m. Double substitutions of Arg2–Arg6, Arg2–Ile9, Arg6–Ile9, Ile3–Ile9, Arg6–Asn10, or Gly7–Asn10 all resulted in a reduction of the neuritogenic effect of P2m. These data indicate that the presence of at least one arginine (Arg2 or Arg6), at least one isoleucine (Ile3 or Ile9), and Asn10 is important for the neuritogenic effect of P2. When the P2 sequence was truncated from the N terminus, the deletion of one amino acid (glycine) was tolerated, but further deletion of Arg2 abolished the neuritogenic effect. The deletion of the C-terminal Phe11–Lys12 also abolished the neuritogenic effects (the peptide in which only Lys12 was removed was not soluble). Single substitution of Phe11 or Lys12 with alanine had no effect, indicating that both the length of the peptide and the presence of the basic amino acid residues at the N and C termini are important for the neuritogenic activity of P2. Previously, NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth has been demonstrated to be accompanied by an activation of the Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway (14Schmid R.S. Graff R.D. Schaller M.D. Chen S. Schachner M. Hemperly J.J. Maness P. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 38: 542-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 15Kolkova K. Novitskaya V. Pedersen N. Berezin V. Bock E. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8310-8319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the neuritogenic response to P2 requires the activation of the ERK1 and ERK2. Hippocampal neurons were treated with UO126, an inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, which can activate ERK1 and ERK2. In Fig. 10, it can be seen that treatment with UO126 inhibited P2-induced neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner. We have recently demonstrated that another ligand of NCAM identified by combinatorial chemistry, the C3 peptide, which similarly to P2 mimics NCAM function (although less efficiently (16Rønn L.C. Olsen M. Ostergaard S. Kiselyov V. Berezin V. Mortensen M.T. Lerche M.H. Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Saffells J.L. Doherty P. Poulsen F.M. Bock E. Holm A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)), induces phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in PC12-E2 cells (15Kolkova K. Novitskaya V. Pedersen N. Berezin V. Bock E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2238-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the effects of P2d and C3d on phosphorylation of the terminal kinases ERK1 and ERK2 in cultures of hippocampal neurons. In Fig.11, A–C, it can be seen that treatment of hippocampal neurons with P2d resulted in a strong phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 peaking around 15–30 min and decreasing 60 min after stimulation, whereas the C3d-induced phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 reached its maximum at 60 min (and remained at the maximal level for at least 6 h, data not shown). Activation of ERK1 and ERK2 by P2d was dose-dependent. In Fig. 12, it can be seen that treatment of hippocampal neurons with 4 μm P2d for 15 min resulted in a stronger increase in kinase phosphorylation than treatment with 2 μm P2d. An inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, UO126, completely blocked P2d-induced phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. In contrast, treatment of cultures with various concentrations of the control peptide, scrP2d, did not affect phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. We conclude that the neuritogenic response induced by P2, similarly to that induced by physiological homophilic NCAM interactions, requires the activation of the MAP kinases.Figure 12Effects of P2d at various peptide concentrations on phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in hippocampal neurons. Lysates of control cultures (lane 1), cultures treated with either P2d (lanes 2–4), or scrambled P2d (lanes 5 and 6) at peptide concentrations of 2 μm (lanes 2 and 5) or 4 μm (lanes 3, 4, and 6) for 15 min were submitted to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using either polyclonal anti-phosphoMAP kinase antibodies or polyclonal anti-MAP kinase antibodies. In lysate 4, the culture was additionally treated with 40 μm MEK1/2 inhibitor, UO126.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we demonstrate that a peptide, GRILARGEINFK, termed P2, which corresponds to the sequence Gly172–Lys183 of NCAM, inhibits aggregation and stimulates neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. We show that P2 binds to the first Ig module of NCAM and suggest that P2 mimics physiological homophilic NCAM binding. Several observations support this suggestion. First, the sequence of the second Ig module of NCAM corresponding to P2 contains the residues, Arg173, Arg177, and Glu179, which were identified by NMR as being involved in the homophilic binding between IgI and IgII. Site-directed mutagenesis corroborated these results (9Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Thomsen N.K. Ralets I. Berezin V. Bock E. Poulsen F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the IgI-IgII dimer revealed that Arg173, Leu175, and Ile180 of the P2 sequence constitute a part of a hydrophobic pocket for the side chains of residues Phe19and Tyr65 in the IgI module, whereas the carboxyl groups of Arg177 and Gly178 form hydrogen bonds with the amino group in the side chain of Lys18 and the amino group of Phe19 of IgI (10Kasper C. Rasmussen H. Kastrup J.S. Ikemizu S. Jones E.Y. Berezin V. Bock E. Kjøller-Larsen I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, by testing a number of derivatives of the P2 peptide containing single and double alanine substitutions at various positions, we found that the residues Arg2, Ile3, Arg6, Gly7, and Ile9 in P2 are essential for its neuritogenic activity. These residues correspond to the residues Arg173, Ile174, Arg177, Gly178, and Ile180 of the second Ig module of NCAM, respectively. Secondly, we showed by plasmon surface resonance analysis that the immobilized P2 peptide directly bound the IgI module with an apparent K d of 4.7 ± 0.9 × 10−6m. This reflects a higher affinity of P2d-IgI binding than the previously reported affinity for the IgI-IgII modules determined by the same method (K d = 5.5 ± 1.6 × 10−5m) (8Kiselyov V.V. Berezin V. Maar T. Soroka V. Edvardsen K. Schousboe A. Bock E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10125-10134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The sequence in the NCAM IgII module corresponding to the P2 peptide adopts a β-hairpin conformation (9Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Thomsen N.K. Ralets I. Berezin V. Bock E. Poulsen F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Presumably, the P2 peptide-IgI interaction is also conformation-dependent, and the conformational transitions are probably not as strictly restrained in the peptide as in the protein module, thus allowing a better conformational adaptation and thereby a higher affinity for the P2 peptide-IgI binding than for the IgII-IgI binding. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that P2 binds to the IgI module at a site different from the homophilic binding site determined by structural analysis. Thirdly, we found that the neuritogenic activity of P2 could be inhibited by preincubation with the recombinant IgI module of NCAM and that the kinetics of this inhibition was adequately described by the apparent K d determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. The effects of NCAM-NCAM interactions on neurite outgrowth and signal transduction are usually evaluated by employing co-cultures of neurons grown on a monolayer of fibroblasts with NCAM expression. Co-cultures of neurons grown on a monolayer of fibroblasts without NCAM expression are used as controls. A limited neurite outgrowth is observed in the control cultures and has been suggested to be integrin-dependent (13Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 99-111Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Using this test system, it has recently been shown that NCAM homophilic binding results in an increase in phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 in hippocampal neurons as compared with hippocampal neurons grown in co-culture with control fibroblasts (15Kolkova K. Novitskaya V. Pedersen N. Berezin V. Bock E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2238-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P2d, but not scrambled P2d, mimicked the effect of homophilic NCAM binding with respect to induction of ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 12). The earlier described C3 peptide (16Rønn L.C. Olsen M. Ostergaard S. Kiselyov V. Berezin V. Mortensen M.T. Lerche M.H. Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Saffells J.L. Doherty P. Poulsen F.M. Bock E. Holm A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and the newly identified P2 peptide may be regarded as NCAM mimetics since both modulate cell-cell adhesion and induce neurite outgrowth, probably by activation of the Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway (15Kolkova K. Novitskaya V. Pedersen N. Berezin V. Bock E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2238-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the neuritogenic effect is 7–15 times larger for the dendrimeric form of P2 (Figs. 5 and 7) than that reported for the dendrimeric form of C3 (16Rønn L.C. Olsen M. Ostergaard S. Kiselyov V. Berezin V. Mortensen M.T. Lerche M.H. Jensen P.H. Soroka V. Saffells J.L. Doherty P. Poulsen F.M. Bock E. Holm A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The observed differences may result in varying degrees of clustering of NCAM on the surface of the hippocampal neurons upon binding of different peptide ligands to IgI, thereby resulting in differences in the kinetics of activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 11) and subsequently in the magnitude of the neuritogenic response. In conclusion, we have identified a new potent peptide ligand of NCAM, P2, which corresponds to a 12-amino acid sequence in the second NCAM Ig module, binds to the first Ig module, and mimics homophilic NCAM binding with respect to modulation of cell adhesion and induction of neuronal differentiation. As a potent mimetic of NCAM, P2 may prove useful as a lead in the development of therapies for neurodegenerative disorders."

Indomethacin alone was a potent and selective inducer of eosinophil and basophil shape change. In eosinophils, indomethacin induced chemotaxis, CD11b up-regulation, respiratory burst, and L-selectin shedding but did not cause up-regulation of CD63 expression. Pretreatment of eosinophils with indomethacin also enhanced subsequent eosinophil shape change induced by eotaxin, although treatment with higher concentrations of indomethacin resulted in a decrease in the expression of the major eosinophil chemokine receptor, CCR3.

Additionally, eosinophils from some donors exhibit a significant expression of CCR1 and respond effectively to its ligand MIP-1α/CCL3 (14Sabroe I. Hartnell A. Jopling L.A. Bel S. Ponath P. Pease J.E. Collins P.D. Williams T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2946-2955PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results have now been seen by other groups (17Struyf S. Menten P. Lenaerts J.P. Put W.

However, activated complement fragments such as C5a and C3a, formylated peptides (formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine), and a wide variety of lipid mediators can also induce similar responses in eosinophils (19Okada S.

These responses are dependent both upon patterns of receptor expression that overlap with other cell types including eosinophils and monocytes and also the varying affinities of ligands such as MCP-1 and MCP-4 for more than one chemokine receptor (15Garcia-Zepeda E.A.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)1 can have complex anti-inflammatory actions. A recent study revealed that, in addition to their effects on cyclooxygenase function, they also caused varying levels of shedding of the adhesion molecule L-selectin from the surface of neutrophils following a reduction in intracellular ATP (35Gómez-Gaviro M.V. Dominguez-Jimenez C. Carretero J.M. Sabando P. Gonzalez-Alvaro I. Sanchez-Madrid F. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Blood. 2000; 96: 3592-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such actions might modulate neutrophil recruitment; however, the ability of NSAIDs to induce similar modulation of eosinophil and basophil function has not been explored. We therefore examined the actions of a large panel of NSAIDs on eosinophil and basophil function. Surprisingly, one NSAID, indomethacin, showed a marked direct action upon leukocytes, inducing selective responses in basophils and eosinophils consistent with a very recent paper that has identified indomethacin as a CRTH2 agonist (36Hirai H. Tanaka K. Takano S. Ichimasa M. Nakamura M. Nagata K. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We have therefore investigated the actions and signaling pathways of indomethacin and related these actions to other stimuli involved in selective recruitment and activation of these allergic inflammatory leukocytes. All laboratory reagents were from Sigma (Poole, UK) unless otherwise specified. The NSAIDs indomethacin, diclofenac, flufenamic acid, etodolac, piroxicam, and flurbiprofen were also from Sigma. The COX-2-selective NSAID NS-398 was from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI), and the COX-1 selective NSAID SC-560 was a generous gift from Dr. R. A. Marks (Searle, Skokie, IL). They were dissolved at high concentration as recommended in water, PBS, Me2SO, or ethanol. Relevant vehicle controls were without effect in any assay tested beyond responses seen in buffer-treated cells alone. Dulbecco's modified PBS (with or without Ca2+ and Mg2+) was from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). Chemokines were from Peprotech EC (London, UK). CellFix and FACSFlow were from Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems (San Jose, CA). Antibodies to CD63 (FITC conjugate) were from Autogen Bioclear (Calne, UK), antibodies to HLA-DR (FITC conjugate) were from Sigma, and antibodies to CD123 (PE) and CD14 (FITC) were from Becton Dickinson. Anti-CD16 (FITC or PE) and anti-CD11b (PE) were purchased from Dako (Ely, UK). Anti-L-selectin (PE) was from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). The anti-human CCR3 monoclonal antibody 7B11 (isotype IgG2a) was a generous gift from Dr. Shixin Qin (Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge, MA). Relevant isotype-matched control antibodies were used throughout. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB-202190, the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U-0126, and the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002 were purchased fromCalbiochem. The phosphatidylinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122 (37Smith R.J. Sam L.M. Justen J.M. Bundy G.L. Bala G.A. Bleasdale J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Boyden chambers and 5-μm pore size polycarbonate filters were from Neuro Probe Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Peripheral blood leukocyte preparations of granulocytes (containing eosinophils and neutrophils) and mononuclear cells (including basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes) were prepared by plasma/Percoll gradients or Histopaque gradients as described (14Sabroe I.

Cells prepared by either technique gave similar results in the highly sensitive assays of leukocyte shape change (data not shown). In some experiments, eosinophils were further purified from granulocyte populations by negative magnetic selection using an antibody mixture from StemCell Technologies (Vancouver, Canada), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Resulting populations of eosinophils were typically >97%, with the majority of contaminating cells being lymphocytes as judged by flow cytometry forward scatter (FSC)/side scatter (SSC) plots. Eosinophil, monocyte, basophil, and neutrophil shape change was assayed as described in previous work (14Sabroe I. Hartnell A. Jopling L.A. Bel S. Ponath P. Pease J.E. Collins P.D. Williams T.J. J.

Stimulation of these leukocytes by chemoattractant and chemokinetic agonists results in changes in cell shape that are measured as changes in their ability to scatter light when illuminated in a flow cytometer (Fig. 1) (14Sabroe I.

In all experiments, data are displayed as percentage increase in FSC compared with samples treated with buffer or vehicle alone. The various vehicles used (Me2SO, PBS, ethanol, and water) were without effect in these shape change assays at the dilutions tested. Eosinophils were identified according to their size and granularity as determined by their FSC/SSC characteristics and by their autofluorescence, neutrophils were identified by FSC/SSC gating and lack of autofluorescence (Fig. 1), basophils were identified by FSC/SSC gating and staining with anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD123, and monocytes were identified by FSC/SSC gating and anti-CD14 staining (14Sabroe I.

Leukocyte preparations were resuspended in assay buffer (PBS plus Ca2+/Mg2+ with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) at 5 × 106 cells/ml together with agonists for the time indicated. Following stimulation, cells were washed in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+ with 0.25% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES) and stained with the indicated antibodies (to L-selectin, CD11b, and CCR3) on ice. The CCR3 antibody was not directly conjugated; therefore, its binding was detected using PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 Ab (DAKO), following which the cells were incubated with mouse IgG for 10 min prior to staining with a FITC-conjugated anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody. For experiments investigating changes in CD63 expression, leukocytes in mixed PMNL suspensions were labeled with anti-CD16, pretreated with cytochalasin B (5 μg/ml) for 5 min, and stimulated for 30 min with agonists as indicated in the presence of the anti-CD63 monoclonal antibody. All data were analyzed by flow cytometry. Eosinophils were identified by FSC/SSC gating and were CD16-negative, while neutrophils were in a similar FSC/SSC region but were CD16-positive. Data were expressed as percentage change from a control sample incubated with buffer alone. Eosinophils purified by negative magnetic selection were stimulated with buffer or agonists at 37 °C for 20 min in the presence of 1 μm dihydrorhodamine 123 (39Emmendörffer A. Hecht M. Lohman-Matthes M.-L. Roesler J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 131: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Subsequent changes in eosinophil fluorescence were measured in the FL-1 channel of the flow cytometer. Eosinophils were purified by negative magnetic selection as described. Fifty μl of cells at 2 × 106/ml (in Hanks' buffered salt solution containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were placed onto the top filter of a micro-Boyden chamber, with agonists in the bottom well of the plate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified CO2incubator for 1 h, and the membrane was carefully removed. Cells in the lower chamber were counted by flow cytometry as previously described for chemotaxis using transwell filters (7Ponath P.D. Qin S. Ringler D.J. Clark-Lewis I. Wang J. Kassam N. Smith H. Shi X. Gonzalo J.-A. Newman W. Gutierrez-Ramos J.-C. Mackay C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In each chemotaxis plate, migration in response to buffer alone was determined, and migration in response to agonists was expressed as a ratio of the migration in response to the buffer control (chemotactic index). Comparisons of two groups of data were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Other data were analyzed by analysis of variance, using Tukey's or Dunnett's post-test. Analysis was performed using the GraphPad InStat and Prism programs (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Shape change induced by eosinophil- and basophil-stimulating ligands was measured as described. Fig.1 illustrates the changes in shape in neutrophils and eosinophils in mixed leukocyte populations as measured by flow cytometry, showing selective eosinophil responses to eotaxin, PGD2, and indomethacin and selective neutrophil responses to interleukin-8. In mean data, Fig.2 A shows that the chemokine eotaxin induced eosinophil and basophil shape change, interleukin-8 induced selective neutrophil shape change, and MCP-1 induced monocyte shape change as described previously. PGD2 was a potent inducer of eosinophil and basophil shape change but had no effect on neutrophils or monocytes. A wide range of NSAIDs have been shown to induce neutrophil L-selectin shedding (35Gómez-Gaviro M.V. Dominguez-Jimenez C. Carretero J.M. Sabando P. Gonzalez-Alvaro I. Sanchez-Madrid F. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Blood. 2000; 96: 3592-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we therefore postulated that they would also induce leukocyte shape change. Surprisingly, of the NSAIDs tested, only indomethacin induced a shape change response. This response was observed in eosinophils and basophils but not neutrophils or monocytes (Fig. 2 A). Indomethacin induced eosinophil shape change with a maximal response at 100 nmand showed lower potency but the same efficacy as eotaxin/CCL11. The NSAIDs ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, NS-398, SC-560, piroxicam, and etodolac (each 50 nm to 10 μm) and acetylsalicylic acid (5 μm to 1 mm) all failed to induce any detectable shape change response in eosinophils or neutrophils (n = 4–6, data not shown). Similarly, diclofenac and flufenamic acid (each 50 nm to 10 μm) were without effect (n = 3, data not shown). We have previously shown that eosinophil shape change can be induced by both chemotactic agonists such as eotaxin/CCL11 and by chemokinetic agonists such as interleukin-5 (14Sabroe I. Hartnell A. Jopling L.A. Bel S. Ponath P. Pease J.E. Collins P.D. Williams T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2946-2955PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the ability of eotaxin/CCL11 and indomethacin to induce eosinophil chemotaxis in micro-Boyden chambers. Each agonist induced migration of eosinophils into the bottom chamber of the chemotaxis plate (Fig. 2 B). The addition of indomethacin (1 μm) to the top of the chemotaxis chamber alone resulted in some variable migration of eosinophils into the lower chamber although to a lesser degree than seen when indomethacin was added to the bottom chamber alone (Fig.2 C). Our data showed that indomethacin acted as an eosinophil chemoattractant agonist in a similar manner to the chemokine eotaxin/CCL11. We therefore investigated whether indomethacin could induce modulation of adhesion molecule expression. Fig.3 A shows that treatment of eosinophils in mixed cell suspensions with indomethacin resulted in a reduction in cell surface L-selectin expression, whereas neutrophil L-selectin expression was not significantly affected. Indomethacin also induced an up-regulation of eosinophil CD11b expression (Fig.3 B). In comparison, neutrophil CD11b expression was not affected by indomethacin at any concentration tested (Fig.3 B). Chemokine chemoattractants are typically good stimulators of leukocyte shape change and chemotaxis, variable inducers of respiratory burst, and relatively poor stimulators of degranulation. Classical chemoattractants such as C5a are more potent inducers of these latter responses. In keeping with these data, eosinophil respiratory burst (Fig. 3 C) and CD63 up-regulation (a degranulation-associated marker (40Monneret G. Gutowski M.C. Bienvenu J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 115: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 D)) were strongly induced by C5a. In contrast, indomethacin, eotaxin/CCL11, and PGD2 all induced eosinophil respiratory burst (eotaxin = PGD2 > indomethacin (Fig. 3 C)), although they were less efficacious than C5a and were unable to induce any changes in eosinophil CD63 expression at the concentrations tested (Fig.3 D). Eosinophil shape change as induced by chemotactic factors is dependent upon G protein-coupled receptors mediating regulation of the cell cytoskeleton. The majority of studies have emphasized a role for pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins in the regulation of leukocyte chemokine responses. Pretreatment of eosinophils with PTX (in accordance with protocols previously used to investigate CCR3 signaling (41Stellato C. Brummet M.E. Plitt J.R. Shahabuddin S. Baroody F.M. Liu M.C. Ponath P.D. Beck L.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1457-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)) suggested differences in the signaling pathways activated by eotaxin and indomethacin. Eosinophil shape change in response to eotaxin/CCL11 was abolished by PTX, whereas in parallel samples, eosinophils retained their ability to respond to both indomethacin and PGD2(Fig. 4 A). Previously, we showed chemokine-induced eosinophil shape change to be inhibited by pretreatment of cells with cytochalasin B (14Sabroe I. Hartnell A. Jopling L.A. Bel S. Ponath P. Pease J.E. Collins P.D. Williams T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2946-2955PubMed Google Scholar). Here again, we found that eosinophil shape change induced by eotaxin was inhibited by cytochalasin B but not by buffer containing the vehicle control, Me2SO (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, indomethacin-induced shape change also showed dependence upon cell microskeletal elements, since it too was inhibited by pretreatment with cytochalasin B. Experiments using PTX (Fig. 4 A) suggested that different signaling pathways were involved in responses of eosinophils to indomethacin and eotaxin/CCL11. In keeping with these data, eotaxin/CCL11-induced shape change was more transient than that induced by indomethacin and was undetectable after prolonged stimulation. In contrast, indomethacin-induced shape change was still detectable after prolonged stimulation, although the concentration-response curve was right-shifted (Fig. 4 C). Chemoattractant agonists activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways in eosinophils, including PLC, PI 3-kinase, and p38 MAPK. We therefore investigated whether indomethacin- and eotaxin-induced eosinophil responses were modulated by antagonists of these pathways. Fig. 5 shows that eosinophil shape change responses induced by eotaxin/CCL11 were markedly attenuated by inhibition of PLC using U-73122. Similarly, responses of eosinophils to indomethacin and PGD2 were inhibited by U-73122, but responses to eotaxin/CCL11, indomethacin, and PGD2 were not inhibited by the control compound, U-73343. Eosinophil shape change induced by submaximal concentrations of eotaxin/CCL11 was inhibited by both the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002 and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-202190 (Fig.6, A and B). However, responses seen at concentrations of eotaxin/CCL11 inducing maximal shape change were not inhibited by either LY-294002 or SB-202190. The up-regulation of eosinophil CD11b expression induced by eotaxin/CCL11 was also inhibited by both LY-294002 and SB-202190 (Fig.6 C) and also by MEK inhibitor U-0126 (Fig. 6 C), although interestingly U-0126 had no effect on eotaxin/CCL11-induced eosinophil shape change (Fig. 6 A). Indomethacin-induced responses in eosinophils were similarly modulated by inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, p38 MAPK, and MEK but with two exceptions (Fig. 6). First, inhibition of p38 MAPK reduced both the potency and efficacy of indomethacin in assays of eosinophil shape change, whereas the p38 MAPK inhibitor suppressed eotaxin-induced eosinophil shape change potency alone. Second, the MEK inhibitor U-0126 caused an insignificant inhibition of eosinophil shape change induced by submaximal indomethacin concentrations and had no effect on indomethacin-induced up-regulation of eosinophil CD11b expression. We have previously shown that G protein-coupled signaling can result in cross-desensitization and internalization of other chemoattractant receptors in human neutrophils (42Sabroe I. Williams T.J. Hébert C.A. Collins P.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1361-1369PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.7 shows that eotaxin/CCL11 induced internalization of its own receptor, in keeping with previous data (43Zimmermann N. Conkright J.J. Rothenberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12611-12618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pretreatment with either indomethacin or PGD2 also resulted in a significant decrease in eosinophil CCR3 expression (Fig. 7), whereas the chemoattractant PAF had no effect. Since indomethacin can be used to treat inflammatory diseases, we determined whether stimulation with this compound would alter eosinophil responses to eotaxin. We pretreated eosinophils with 100 nmindomethacin (the EC50 of CCR3 down-regulation (Fig. 7)) for 30 min and then removed the indomethacin by a single wash step prior to stimulation of the cells with eotaxin/CCL11. The data shown in Fig. 8 show that the efficacy of eotaxin/CCL11-induced shape change was increased by indomethacin pretreatment, whether the data were shown as mean FSC (Fig.8 A) or responses were corrected for the minor increase in eosinophil FSC base line arising fro"

Mirk enhanced HNF1α transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas two kinase-inactive Mirk mutants and a Mirk N-terminal deletion mutant did not. Mirk, DCoHm, and HNF1α formed a complex. Mirk bound to a specific region within the CREB-binding protein-binding region of HNF1α and phosphorylated HNF1α at a site adjacent to the Mirk-binding region. Conversely, the HNF1α binding domain was located within the first five conserved kinase subdomains of Mirk. Mirk co-immunoprecipitated with the MAPK kinase MKK3, an upstream activator of p38. MKK3 enhanced Mirk kinase activity and the transcriptional activation of HNF1α by Mirk, suggesting that Mirk, like p38, is activated by certain environmental stress agents. The Mirk-binding protein DCoH has been shown to be selectively expressed in colon carcinomas but not in normal tissue.

Conversely, the HNF1α binding domain was located within the first five conserved kinase subdomains of Mirk. Mirk co-immunoprecipitated with the MAPK kinase MKK3, an upstream activator of p38. MKK3 enhanced Mirk kinase activity and the transcriptional activation of HNF1α by Mirk, suggesting that Mirk, like p38, is activated by certain environmental stress agents. The Mirk-binding protein DCoH has been shown to be selectively expressed in colon carcinomas but not in normal tissue. Mirk may function as an HNF1α transcriptional activator in response to an MKK3-mediated stress signal, and the selective expression of DCoH could restrict the Mirk response to carcinoma cells. minibrain-related kinase dual-specificity Yak-related kinase cAMP-response element CRE-binding protein hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase kinase 3 1 m sorbitol, 0.1 msodium citrate, pH 7.6, 0.06 m EDTA myelin basic protein glutathione S-transferase 20 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol dimerization cofactor of HNF1α from muscle 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a tablet of protease inhibitor 10 mm Tris-HCL, pH8.0, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 CREB-binding protein Mirk1/Dyrk1B is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is expressed at elevated levels in normal skeletal muscle and certain carcinoma cell lines and at low levels in many normal tissues (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Colon carcinoma cell lines stably overexpressing Mirk proliferated in serum-free medium (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanism of Mirk action that enabled this survival capacity is unknown. Mirk is a member of the Dyrk/minibrain family of dual specificity, tyrosine-regulated, arginine-directed protein kinases (2Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schurman A. Huppertz C.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mirk/Dyrk1B and the related kinase Dyrk1A exhibit 54% amino acid identity with 90% identity or homology within the conserved kinase domain. Several lines of evidence indicate that Dyrk1A mediates neuronal differentiation. Dyrk1A has been mapped to the Down's syndrome critical region of chromosome 21, overexpression of Dyrk1A has been found in the Down's syndrome fetal brain (6Guimera J. Casas C. Estivill X. Pritchard M. Genomics. 1999; 57: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and transgenic mice overexpressing Dyrk1A exhibit cognitive deficits and motor abnormalities characteristic of Down's syndrome (7Altafaj X. Dierssen M. Baamonde C. Marti E. Visa J. Guimera J. Oset M. Gonzalez J. Florez J. Fillat C. Estivill X. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Dyrk1A has been shown to phosphorylate the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) in vivo, leading to the stimulation of subsequent cAMP response element-mediated transcription during neuronal differentiation in hippocampal progenitor cells (8Yang E. Ahn Y.S. Chung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), an activity consistent with its likely mediation of neuronal maturationin vivo. Because Mirk/Dyrk1B was expressed at elevated levels in normal muscle tissue, we screened a muscle cell cDNA library to detect possible Mirk targets and found that Mirk/Dyrk1B activated the transcription factor HNF1α (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α) and bound to its cofactor DCoH. Antibodies to MKK3 and HNF1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and antibodies to the flag-epitope were from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to a unique sequence at the C terminus of Mirk was raised as described (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer paper Immobolin-P was purchased from Millipore. PLUS reagent and LipofectAMINE were from Invitrogen, all radioactive materials were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and ECL reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were from Sigma. We thank Stephen E. Mercer of this institution for GST-Mirk preparations. NIH3T3 cells and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum and modified and supplemented as described (9Hafez M. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 753-762PubMed Google Scholar). pHX9F (Mirk) and pHX9F (kinase-inactive YF Mirk) had been previously generated (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), and all other Mirk expression plasmids, including the pGBKT7-Mirk construct used for the yeast two-hybrid screening, were prepared by Dr. Xiaobing Deng. 2X. Deng, manuscript in preparation. The (β-28)3-luciferase plasmid encoding three tandem repeats of the β-fibrinogen HNF1α binding domain in front of a TATA box promoter and a luciferase reporter gene, the expression plasmid pBJ5-DCoH, and the expression plasmid pBJ5-HNF1α were the kind gifts of Dr. G. Crabtree, Stanford University. FLAG-MKK3b and MKK3b(E), each in pcDNA3, were the kind gifts of Dr. J. Han, Scripps Institute. A human muscle cDNA library subcloned into the pACT2 vector was purchased form CLONTECH. We are grateful to Dr. David Amberg of this institution for help with the two-hybrid screening. For the bait construct, wild-type full-length Mirk cDNA was subcloned into the pGBKT7 vector, because Mirk had no transcriptional activity by itself. The yeast host strain, AH109, contains three different reporter genes that are tightly controlled by the upstream activator sequence, which required GAL4 binding for expression of the reporter gene. AH109 cells were simultaneously co-transformed with pGBKT7-Mirk and the pACT2 muscle cDNA library according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transformants were plated on -His/-Leu/-Trp medium, including 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triasol to screen for the expression of His-3, and incubated at 30 °C for 7–10 days. Subsequently, His+ colonies were replated on -Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/X-α-gal medium, and blue colonies were selected as positive candidates. The plasmids from candidate colonies were harvested as described (10Amberg D. Zahner J. Mulholland J. Pringle J. Botstein D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 8: 729-753Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 5 ml of selective media overnight and collected by pelleting. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer and then incubated at 37 °C for 30–90 min after brief vortexing. Lysis buffer consisted of a mixture of 5 ml of SCE buffer, 60 μl of 100T zymolyase (10 mg/ml), and 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. Following the addition of 400 μl of 0.2 n NaOH/1% SDS solution the lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min and then pelleted, and the supernatants were decanted into fresh tubes and then reclarified by repeated pelleting. The plasmid DNA of each candidate was precipitated and then transformedEscherichia coli DH5α using electroporation. The sequences of candidate DNA were analyzed by using an automatic DNA sequencer (model 3700 BC 1.1.0.0, ABI PRISM). Hexahistidine fusion Mirk was produced by a coupled in vitro transcription and translation system (Promega) using 1 μg of pHX plasmid per reaction. Produced protein was immunoprecipitated overnight by using His6 monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) and 10 μl of 50% protein A-Sephadex (Sigma). The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and three times with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase activities of Mirk were tested with either the myelin basic protein (MBP) from Upstate Biotechnology, immunoprecipitated HNF1 overexpressed in 293T cells, or recombinant GST-HNF1 proteins as a substrate according to the protocol by Upstate Biotechnology. Briefly, 10 μl of assay dilution buffer (ADB), 10 μl of GST-Mirk (200 ng/1 μg) in ADB, 10 μl of MBP (2 μg/μl) in ADB, and 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μCi/μl) in a magnesium/ATP mixture (500 μm cold ATP and 75 mm MgCl2in ADB) were added to the reaction mixture. Immunoprecipitated MKK3E or recombinant p38 (Upstate Biotech.) was added in the mixture. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 15 min with gentle agitation. The reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The phospholabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and detected by autoradiography. 293T cells were transiently transfected by adding a complex of LipofectAMINE (2–4 μg/μg of DNA) in serum-free media for 24 h. For reporter gene assays, NIH3T3 cells were seeded the day before transfection at 0.9 × 105/well and allowed to grow overnight in 7% serum-containing media. Cells were transfected by incubating with a complex of PLUS reagent (3 μl/μg DNA) and LipofectAMINE (2 μl/μg DNA) in serum-free media for 18–24 h in a CO2incubator. The amount of total DNA used was kept constant by the addition of empty vector DNA, and luciferase activities were calibrated by co-transfected β-galactosidase activity to normalize the transfection efficiency. These assays were carried out in triplicate, and the data shown are representative of three independent experiments. [35S]-Met-labeled Mirk and DCoHm produced by using the TnT transcription and translation system (Promega) were co-immunoprecipitated in vitro. TnT products (5 μl each) were mixed, and 5 μl of rabbit polyclonal antibody to the unique C terminus of Mirk or preimmune serum was added with rocking overnight at 4 °C. 20 μl of a slurry of protein A-agarose conjugates (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then added and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads in each tube were extensively washed five times, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 293T cells in multiple 60-mm dishes were co-transfected with 1 μg of the DNA of either MKK3 or MKK3E together with expression plasmids for either Mirk, kinase-inactive YF-Mirk, or pHisA vector (1 μg/well), allowed to express for 24 h, and then each dish was lysed in 0.25 ml of EBC buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). An aliquot of total lysate of 300 μg was immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of an anti-C2 Mirk anti-peptide rabbit polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C; the complexes were then collected by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-agarose, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, washed three times with EBC buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Following treatment as indicated and washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in EBC or radioimmune precipitation buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and the following protease inhibitors: 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μmsodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride). Lysates were pelleted in a microfuge for 15 min to remove insoluble material. Depending upon the experiment, 10–50 μg of cell lysate were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation on SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody in TBST buffer-3% milk, and proteins were subsequently detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. All Mirk blots used an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed to the Mirk-unique C terminus. Band density in autoradiograms was measured using a Lacie Silverscanner and Silverscanner III software and analyzed by the IP LabGel program. Mirk and DCoHm were producedin vitro by a coupled transcription and translation system (Promega) using 1 μg of plasmid per reaction. Translation took place in the presence of 2 μl of 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. The labeled TnT proteins and the GST-fusion proteins were incubated together in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) overnight and washed six times in the same buffer before analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To discover the function of Mirk, we used the yeast two-hybrid assay to find Mirk-binding proteins. We isolated a novel gene of the DCoH (11Mendel D. Khavari P. Conley P. Graves M. Hansen L. Admon A. Crabtree G. Science. 1991; 254: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) family, DCoHm, by yeast two-hybrid analysis using full-length Mirk as bait. Yeast two-hybrid could be used because Mirk alone does not transactivate in the yeast two-hybrid assay. 3.5 × 106 clones of a human skeletal muscle cDNA library were screened to obtain 17 candidate genes, one of which wasDCoHm. HNF1α is a transcription factor found in endoderm-derived tissues, including kidney, liver, intestine and pancreas, where it may function in maintaining the differentiated phenotype (12Erickson R. Lai R. Kim Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HNF1α is also a tissue-specific transcription factor regulating glucose metabolism-related genes in the liver (11Mendel D. Khavari P. Conley P. Graves M. Hansen L. Admon A. Crabtree G. Science. 1991; 254: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (13Nolten L. Steenberg P. Sussenbach J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1488-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the pancreatic-beta cells, and the protooncogene c-Src in the intestine (14Bonham K. Ritchie S. Dehm S. Snyder K. Boyd F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37604-37611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DCoH binds as a dimer to the unstable HNF1α dimer and enables effective binding of the tetrameric complex to DNA (15Rhee K. Steir G. Becker P. Suck D. Sandaltzopoulos J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DCoH enhances HNF1α transcription activity 2–3-fold by stabilizing this complex (11Mendel D. Khavari P. Conley P. Graves M. Hansen L. Admon A. Crabtree G. Science. 1991; 254: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The DCoH family is highly conserved. DCoHm has 78 and 88% amino acid identity to human and chicken DCoH, respectively (Fig.1). DCoHm was considered likely to have activity similar to other members of the DCoH family, because it retained the amino acids necessary for transcriptional activation of HNF1α, His-62, His-63, and His-80 as well as amino acid Phe-67, which mediates binding to HNF1α (16Johnen G. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13469-13474Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The interaction of Mirk and DCoHm was confirmed in yeast AH109 cells by a 1.5–2-fold activation of a β-galactosidase reporter gene localized downstream of DCoHm (data not shown). Protein interaction was also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of in vitro 35S-labeled DCoHm with Mirk using antibody to the unique C terminus of Mirk (Fig. 2) with preimmune serum (P) used in the control. Thelast lane shows 30% of input DCoHm. The physical association between DCoHm and Mirk shown by co-immunoprecipitation confirms the binding between DCoHmand Mirk in the yeast two-hybrid analysis.Figure 2DCoHm is found associated with immunoprecipitated Mirk. Both Mirk and DCoHm (Dm) were [35S]methionine-labeled during in vitrocoupled transcription and translation, immunoprecipitated with the anti-peptide antibody to Mirk, and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. P, preimmune serum used in control immunoprecipitation. One of two replicate experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because DCoH functions to stabilize HNF1α and increase its transcriptional capacity, we next tested whether Mirk altered the activity of HNF1α. HNF1α has been shown to increase by 60-fold the activity of the reporter construct (β-28)3-Luc, which consists of three copies of the HNF1α binding element, whereas DCoH further enhanced this activation about 2-fold (16Johnen G. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13469-13474Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We assayed for the effects of Mirk on HNF1α transcriptional activation of (β-28)3-Luc in transient transfection assays in NIH3T3 cells, which exhibit low levels of endogenous DCoH. DCoH alone, Mirk alone, or DCoH plus Mirk were unable to activate (β-28)3-Luc. In contrast, the expression of HNF1α alone was enough to activate the reporter construct 20-fold, and co-expression of HNF1α and DCoH activated the reporter 30-fold (Fig. 3 A,first six lanes). Increasing amounts of Mirk were co-transfected with expression plasmids for HNF1α and DCoH, which resulted in a dose-dependent activation of HNF1α, up to five times the activation induced by HNF1α and DCoH and 7.5 times the activation by HNF1α alone (Fig. 3 A,last four lanes). Therefore, Mirk can substantially increase the transcriptional activity of HNF1α and may function as a co-activator of HNF1α in vivo. What is its significance? Mirk/Dyrk1B was cloned from colon carcinoma cells, where it is likely to interact with DCoH in vivo. Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated that DCoH is expressed in each of 20 colon carcinomas independent of Dukes' stage and in each of two colon carcinoma cell lines but not in normal tissue (17Eskinazi R. Thony B. Svoboda M. Robberecht P. Dassesse D. Heizmann C. Van Laethem J.-L. Resibois A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), so the presence of DCoH selectively in tumor tissue may allow Mirk through DCoH to activate HNF1α in cancer cells. We next tested whether Mirk might be able to activate HNF1α without DCoH. To determine whether DCoH could potentiate the co-activating effect of Mirk, HNF1α was transfected at a suboptimal level, one-half of that used in the previous experiment. A 50-fold range of Mirk concentrations was co-transfected with HNF1α with or without DCoH (Fig. 3 B). Mirk was more effective as a co-activator of HNF1α in the presence of DCoH. The highest Mirk concentration tested induced over twice as much reporter gene activity in the presence of DCoH as in its absence. Mirk, like DCoH and HNF1α, forms dimers (data not shown). These data together suggest that HNF1α, DCoH, and Mirk could act as a heterohexamer, with dimers of DCoH stabilizing the HNF1α dimer and serving as an attachment factor for dimerized Mirk. Mirk is a serine/threonine protein kinase activated by autophosphorylation on tyrosine (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Was the capacity to phosphorylate HNF1α necessary for the activation of this transcription factor by Mirk? Wild-type Mirk increased HNF1α activation 3-fold when co-transfected with DCoH and HNF1α, whereas the co-transfection of two Mirk kinase-inactive mutant constructs, Mirk-YF and Mirk-KR (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect (Fig. 4 A), demonstrating that the kinase activity of Mirk is essential for its ability to increase HNF1α function. Further mutational analysis of Mirk was performed. Mirk is composed of a central conserved kinase domain flanked by non-conserved N-terminal and C-terminal sequences (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Mirk deletion constructs were made; ΔNMirk consists of amino acids 110–629, and ΔCMirk consists of amino acids 1–435. The deletion of the N-terminal region of Mirk completely suppressed the activation of HNF1α by Mirk, whereas the deletion of the Mirk C terminus had little effect (Fig. 4 A). We next tested whether a double mutant, ΔN-KR, would act as a dominant negative, but the double mutant did not completely suppress HNF1α activity and simply maintained it at background levels. These co-transfection experiments (Fig. 4 A) had included DCoH. We next compared the effect of wild-type and mutant Mirk on HNF1α activation in the absence of DCoH. Wild-type Mirk enhanced HNF1α transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of DCoH, whereas kinase-inactive YF-Mirk and the Mirk deletion mutant ΔNMirk had no activity (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that Mirk kinase activity was essential for Mirk function as a transcriptional co-activator of HNF1. Transcription factors are often activated through a kinase cascade such as the well known MAP kinase superfamily. Mirk was shown to be a substrate of extracellular signal-related kinase 2 (ERK2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK1), and p38 in vitro (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that one or more MAP kinases might activate Mirk in vivo, allowing Mirk to then activate HNF1α. We screened a series of MAP kinase kinases and their activators for their ability to substitute for Mirk in HNF1α activation using the β-fibrinogen promoter reporter construct (β-28)3-Luc in transient transfection experiments. The MAP kinase kinase MKK3, an activator of p38 (18Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 19Cuenda A. Alonso G. Morrice N. Jones M. Meier R. Cohen P. Nebreda A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4156-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barret T.T., Wu, I. Han J. Ulevitch R. Davis R. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar), was capable of activating HNF1α (Fig. 5). The constitutively activated form of MKK3, doubly mutated at its activation domain MKK3E (S189E/T193E) (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), was used in place of MKK3 because it activates its downstream kinase targets without itself requiring activation by upstream signals. Both Mirk and MKK3E activated HNF1α 3–5-fold. When Mirk and MKK3E were added together, they induced a synergistic increase of 15-fold HNF1α activation. Activation of HNF1α as a transcription factor, potentiated by MKK3E, also required the same Mirk functions as described earlier (Fig. 4), i.e.Mirk kinase activity, the nonconserved N terminus of Mirk, but not the nonconserved C terminus of Mirk. Wild-type Mirk could not be replaced by either kinase-inactive Mirk or ΔNMirk but could be replaced to some extent by ΔCMirk (Fig. 5). MKK3E is a potent activator of p38 (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). These data suggested three models. 1) Mirk and MKK3E activated HNF1α independently. 2) MKK3E directly activated Mirk by phosphorylation. 3) MKK3E activated p38, which in turn phosphorylated and activated Mirk. To test this hypothesis, we initially determined whether Mirk and MKK3 interacted directly by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 293T cells were co-transfected with either MKK3 or MKK3E together with either wild-type Mirk, kinase-inactive YF-Mirk, or epitope-tagged vector, and Mirk was immunoprecipitated after expression (Fig.6 A). A distinct band of MKK3E was observed in both the immunoprecipitates of wild-type Mirk and kinase-inactive Mirk. Much less (6–7%) wild-type MKK3 associated with Mirk, although similar amounts of MKK3E, MKK3, and Mirk were synthesized in the lysates (Western blot of total lysates shown inlower two panels, Fig. 6 A). Therefore, MKK3E associated directly with Mirk, and any effect MKK3E exerted on HNF1α could be mediated through exogenous or endogenous Mirk (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Because MKK3 is a potent activator of p38 (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), it was also possible that MKK3 activates Mirk. MKK3E was expressed in 293T cells, immunoprecipitated, and added to in vitro kinase reaction mixtures containing recombinant purified Mirk or recombinant purified p38, as indicated, with [γ-32P]-ATP and MBP as substrates. The reaction mixtures containing [γ-32P]-ATP were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 6 B). Mirk phosphorylation of MBP was increased ∼50% in the presence of MKK3E, although MKK3E itself did not phosphorylate MBP. As a control, MKK3E was shown to increase the activity of a small concentration of p38 as an MBP kinase ∼50% (Fig.6 B, last two lanes). Therefore, MKK3 binds to Mirk and increases Mirk kinase activity. Because MKK3 mediates various environmental stress signals, it is possible that MKK3 increases the function of Mirk as a transcriptional activator of HNF1α in response to certain stresses. Stably overexpressed Mirk enables cells to proliferate and remain viable in serum-free conditions (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), possibly because Mirk activates the transcription of survival factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1 through the activation of HNF1α. We next determined the regions of Mirk and HNF1α necessary for their interaction. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays confirmed a three-part association betweenDCoHm, Mirk, and HNF1 (Fig. 7 A, lanes 4–6). Both DCoHm and Mirk were 35S-labeled by coupled transcription and translation reactions, incubated with either GST-HNF1α or GST coupled to beads, and the bead eluates were examined by PAGE followed by autoradiography. DCoHm and Mirk, when added individually or added together, bound to HNF1α (Fig.7 A). DCoHm bound more strongly to HNF1α than did Mirk when the bound fraction to total input was compared. There was no additive effect of DCoHm and Mirk in multiple experiments. Neither DCoHm or HNF1α bound to GST. Next, a series of deletion mutants of HNF1α were generated, and GST-pull down assays were repeated with 35S-labeled Mirk (Fig. 7 B). Mirk bound to HNF1α fragments encompassing amino acids 1–203 and 1–283 but not to fragments of the N terminus (amino acids 1–111) or C-terminal regions (amino acids 283–481 and 481 to 628). Therefore, the minimal region of Mirk/HNF1α binding encompassed HNF1α amino acids 112–203. This region was similar to the minimal region for HNF1α interaction with the co-activator CBP (22Soutoglou E. Papafotiou G. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12515-12520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), amino acids 95–295. We next determined which region of Mirk was necessary for binding to HNF1α by performing GST pull-down assays with deletion constructs of Mirk (Fig.8). The constructs consisted of ΔNMirk (amino acids 110–629) cleaved of the nonconserved N terminus; ΔN2Mirk (amino acids 233–629) cleaved of the nonconserved N terminus and the first five subdomains of the conserved kinase domain and the ATP binding site K140; Δ233–435, a partial kinase-domain deletion of amino acids 233–435 that retained the N and C termini; ΔCMirk (amino acids 1–435 with the nonconserved C terminus deleted); and C, an unrelated control protein p53. There were equivalent amounts of Mirk deletion products added to the GST pull-downs (Fig. 8, lower panel). However, ΔN2 Mirk bound very poorly to GST-HNF1α-(1–203) compared with the other deletion constructs and to full-length Mirk (Fig. 8, lane 1). Therefore, the Mirk region of amino acids 111–233 encompassing the first five conserved kinase subdomains was essential for Mirk binding to HNF1α. A direct interaction between Mirk and HNF1α occurred in the absence of DCoHm, shown in the GST pull-down assays (Fig. 7 A, lane 5). These results suggested that DCoHm simply facilitated Mirk association with HNF1α and that HNF1α might be the immediate target of Mirk. This was shown to be the case, because Mirk phosphorylated GST-HNF1α in vitro in the absence of DCoHm while exhibiting no kinase activity on GST itself (Fig. 9 A) or on DCoHm (data not shown). Therefore, Mirk binds to DCoHm in the DCoHm/HNF1α tetramer and is thus able to directly bind and then phosphorylate HNF1α. There was no canonical arginine-directed Dyrk1A phosphorylation site (4Himpel S. Tegge W. Frank R. Leder S. Joost H. Becker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2431-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) within the region of HNF1α that binds to Mirk (HNF1α, amino acids 112–203). However, a perfect Dyrk1A phosphorylation site was seen at Ser-249, which is still within the CBP binding domain (22Soutoglou E. Papafotiou G. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12515-12520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mutation of this site decreased phosphorylation by Mirk 2.5-fold (Fig. 9 B). Mirk binds to a region within the N terminus of HNF1α and then phosphorylates an amino acid just distal to the binding region but still within the CBP binding domain. Additional studies will determine whether phosphorylation at this site increases CBP binding and HNF1α activation in vivo. Mirk/Dyrk1B, like its family member Dyrk1A, is now shown to function as a transcription factor activator. There is strong evidence that Dyrk1A functions in neurogenesis and brain development (6Guimera J. Casas C. Estivill X. Pritchard M. Genomics. 1999; 57: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 7Altafaj X. Dierssen M. Baamonde C. Marti E. Visa J. Guimera J. Oset M. Gonzalez J. Florez J. Fillat C. Estivill X. Hum. Mol.

Lou L. Kurnit D. Genomics. 1996; 38: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Dyrk1A activity was induced during the differentiation of immortalized hippocampal progenitor cells, and the addition of the neurogenic factor basic fibroblast growth factor to these cells resulted in the specific binding of Dyrk1A to CREB, the phosphorylation of CREB by Dyrk1A, and the stimulation of CRE-mediated gene transcription (8Yang E. Ahn Y.S. Chung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mirk/Dyrk1B is also expressed in the brain, but its highest expression is in skeletal muscle (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Screening a normal skeletal muscle cDNA library led us to discover that Mirk binds to a novel member of the highly conserved DCoH family, DCoHm. DCoH binds as a dimer to the unstable HNF1α dimer and enables effective binding of the tetrameric complex to DNA (15Rhee K. Steir G. Becker P. Suck D. Sandaltzopoulos J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DCoH enhances HNF1α transcription activity 2–3-fold by stabilizing this complex (11Mendel D. Khavari P. Conley P. Graves M. Hansen L. Admon A. Crabtree G. Science. 1991; 254: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and Mirk increased this activity a further 5-fold. The interaction between DCoHm and Mirk was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies and GST-pull down assays. Mirk was shown to substantially increase the transcription activity of HNF1α in transient transfection assays and may function as a co-activator of HNF1α in vivo. Mirk did not require DCoH to active HNF1α. Mirk, through the N terminus of its conserved kinase domain, bound to HNF1α at a site within its CBP binding domain and then directly phosphorylated HNF1α adjacent to the binding site but still within the CBP binding domain. Mirk kinase activity was required for transcriptional activation of HNF1α, because kinase-inactive mutants were also unable to activate HNF1α. HNF1α mediates the transcription of several genes that potentially could contribute to the differentiation and growth of normal muscle cells through Mirk interaction with DCoHm. However, Mirk is expressed in several cell lines established from solid tumors, including colon, lung, and ovarian, with much less expression in leukemia and lymphoma-derived cell lines (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). DCoH and Mirk are both expressed in colon carcinomas. DCoH was not found in normal colon tissue but was found in every colon carcinoma examined by immunohistochemistry (17Eskinazi R. Thony B. Svoboda M. Robberecht P. Dassesse D. Heizmann C. Van Laethem J.-L. Resibois A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and Mirk was found in each of seven colon carcinoma cell lines (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Mirk, DCoH, and HNF1α were found to form a complex in vitro, thus Mirk may complex with the DCoH/HNF1α tetramerin vivo. Therefore, in many colon carcinomas Mirk and DCoH are co-expressed and may function as an activating complex for HNF1α to induce ectopic gene expression. The expression of some of these genes may contribute to the ability of cell lines with stably overexpressed Mirk to maintain serum-free proliferation (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant Mirk is a constitutively active kinase. However, its kinase activity on MBP and its transcriptional activation of HNF1α was enhanced by MKK3, an upstream activator of the stress-activated MAP kinase p38 (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). MKK3 also directly bound to Mirk in vivo as demonstrated in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. MKK3 is activated by phosphorylation at Ser-189 and Thr-193 within a P-activation loop of its conserved kinase subdomain VIII (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) by upstream kinases in response to stress agents. p38, in turn, is activated by dual phosphorylation at threonine and tyrosine within the TPY motif in conserved kinase subdomain VIII (25Han J. Lee J. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 26Lee J. Laydon J. McDonnell P. Gallagher T. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M. Heys J.

Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). However, Mirk/Dyrk1B's activation domain is YQY, which is at a position located within conserved subdomains VII and VIII of the catalytic domain homologous to the p38 activation domain (1Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies of the related kinase Dyrk1A have shown that only the second tyrosine in the activation domain, Tyr-321 and not Tyr-319, was autophosphorylated, and the mutation of Tyr-319 to Phe failed to reduce kinase activity (28Himpel S. Panzer P. Eirmbter K. Czajkowska H. Sayed M. Packman L. Blundell T. Kentrup H. Grotzinger J. Joost H. Becker W. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). MKK3 possibly activates Mirk by phosphorylating it at the second tyrosine in its activation domain. Autophosphorylated tyrosine residues were also found in the N terminus of Dyrk1A, and deletion of the N terminus suppressed kinase activity (28Himpel S. Panzer P. Eirmbter K. Czajkowska H. Sayed M. Packman L. Blundell T. Kentrup H. Grotzinger J. Joost H. Becker W. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) as deletion of the N terminus of Mirk suppressed its transactivator activity (Fig. 4). Dyrk1A is an arginine-directed kinase (4Himpel S. Tegge W. Frank R. Leder S. Joost H. Becker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2431-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and comparison of the Dyrk1A and ERK2 catalytic cores revealed that Tyr-321 of Dyrk1A can interact with Arg-325 and Arg-328 (28Himpel S. Panzer P. Eirmbter K. Czajkowska H. Sayed M. Packman L. Blundell T. Kentrup H. Grotzinger J. Joost H. Becker W. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). There are also two comparable arginine residues upstream of the YQY activation motif of Mirk. Although Dyrk1A and Mirk/Dyrk1B can autophosphorylate in bacteria, greater phosphorylation was seen when both proteins were expressed in mammalian cells. MKK3 binding sites and phosphorylation sites on Mirk must be mapped to uncover the precise relationship between MKK3 and Mirk."

An effective prophylaxis or treatment against RSV is not available. Intranasal administration of a plasmid expressing IFN-γ cDNA or a recombinant RSV expressing IFN-γ attenuates virus replication in mice without compromising immunogenicity (3Kumar M. Behera A.K.

The potential and mechanism of IFN-γ as an antiviral agent against RSV-induced lung disease remain to be elucidated.IFN-γ, a type II interferon, is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in modulating nearly all phases of immune and inflammatory responses. IFNs bind to specific receptors on cells and activate a JAK-STAT (Januskinase-signal transducer andactivator of transcription) signaling cascade that culminates in the transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (5Schindler C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The Jak1 and Jak2 phosphorylate STAT-1 following the binding of IFN-γ to its receptor (5Schindler C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Annu. Rev.

Once phosphorylated, STAT molecules dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and bind to γ-activated sequence elements present in the regulatory regions of various ISGs. The antiviral mechanism of IFN-γ may involve one or more of a number of ISG-encoded products, including interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) (8Kimura T. Nakayama K. Penninger J. Kitagawa M.

Martinand C. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Salehzada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13308-13317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The 2–5 AS produces a series of 5′-phosphorylated and 2′- and 5′-linked oligoadenylates (2–5A) from ATP when activated by double-stranded RNA (12Clemens M.J. Williams B.R. Cell. 1978; 13: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 16Hovanessian A.G. Brown R.E. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1977; 268: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the binding of 2–5A with RNase L results in the release of RLI, dimerization, and the activation of RNase L (17Silverman R.H. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: structure and function. Academic Press, NY1997: 515Crossref Google Scholar), and subsequently activated RNase L mediates the cleavage of single-stranded RNA. However, the mechanism of the induction and activation of each of these genes vary in different cells and for the type of viruses. The mechanism of the IFN-γ-mediated antiviral activity remains to be elucidated for many clinically important viruses.Previously, we have shown that in BALB/c mice, RSV infection produces IFN-γ, which coincides with the resolution of infection (18Matsuse H. Behera A.K. Kumar M. Rabb H. Lockey R.F. Mohapatra S.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6583-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and prophylactic intranasal IFN-γ gene transfer decreases RSV replication and infection (3Kumar M. Behera A.K. Matsuse H Lockey R.F. Mohapatra S.S. Vaccine. 1999; 18: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Whereas alveolar pneumocytes are the primary target of RSV infection in mice (19Byrd L.G. Prince G.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 25: 1363-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), RSV targets epithelial cells in human airways and lungs (20Tristram D.A. Hicks W., Jr. Hard R. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 1998; 124: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this study, the mechanism of IFN-γ-mediated anti-RSV activity was investigated in the HEp-2 cells, which are normally used for RSV propagation, and in the human lung alveolar epithelial cell line A549. Our results indicate that the IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of RSV infection in human epithelial cells involves the 2–5 AS/RNase L pathway.DISCUSSIONThis report focuses on the elucidation of the mechanism underlying IFN-γ-mediated resistance to RSV infection in human epithelial cells. The salient findings from these studies are as follows. (i) IFN-γ given before or after RSV infection significantly attenuates RSV infection of human epithelial cells. (ii) Exposure of these cells to IFN-γ induces IRF-1, which, in turn, induces a key antiviral protein, 2–5 AS. (iii) The latter produces 2–5A, which activates RNase L, responsible for degradation of viral RNAs.RSV is resistant to the antiviral effects of type-I interferons and human MxA (22Atreya P.L. Kulkarni S. Virology. 1999; 261: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, the finding that treatment of HEp-2 and A549 cells from 20 h pre-infection with as low as 100 units/ml of IFN-γ inhibits RSV infection and replication when compared with untreated cells has significant therapeutic implications. HEp-2 and A549 cells treated with 1000 units/ml of IFN-γ from 20 h pre-infection to 72 h post-infection exhibited a 97% (30–31-fold in log10 plaque-forming units/ml) reduction in RSV titer. Furthermore, treatment of these cells with IFN-γ 1 h post-RSV infection without any prior treatment with IFN-γ significantly decreased (by 39%; 1.7-fold reduction in log10 plaque-forming units/ml) RSV titer. The anti-RSV effect of IFN-γ in the most permissive cell lines, such as HEp-2 and A549, implicates its potential as an important therapeutic modality against RSV infection.The mechanism of antiviral action of IFN-γ is complex and may be unique for individual cell lines and viruses. Because HEp-2 and A549 represent the most RSV-permissive epithelial cell lines, they were selected to investigate the expression profile of ISGs including IRF-1, IRF-2, PKR, and iNOS, which are potentially relevant to IFN-γ-induced antiviral activity in these cells. The results indicate that IFN-γ induces both the mRNA and protein for IRF-1 but not IRF-2. These findings in HEp-2 cells are consistent with those found for human macrophages, where IFN-γ treatment does not enhance IRF-2 gene expression, despite strong up-regulation of IRF-1 mRNA expression (35Lehtonen A. Matikainen S. Julkunen I. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 794-803PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that in non-induced cells the IRF-2 protein functions as a repressor of ISGs (36Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). IFN-γ induction temporarily removes this repression and activates ISGs including IRF-1. IRF-1 and IRF-2 compete for the same cis-acting recognition sequences but with opposite effects (36Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 37Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.Q.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5279-5287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKR has been implicated in antiviral activity. IFN-γ-activated PKR phosphorylates and inactivates eIF-2α and leads to restriction of cellular, as well as viral, protein synthesis (39Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-11296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 40Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The results that IFN-γ treatment induces a gradual decline in PKR protein expression and no change in phosphorylation of eIF-2α (data not shown) indicate that PKR is not involved in IFN-γ-mediated antiviral activity in these cells. Furthermore, iNOS is known to mediate antiviral property of IFN-γ (41Reiss C.S. Komatsu T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of detectable levels of iNOS protein or NO in IFN-γ-stimulated HEp-2 and A549 cells indicates that iNOS does not play a role in IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of RSV infection in these cells.IFN-γ is known to induce IRF-1, which, in turn, activates 2–5 AS expression (30Coccia E.M.

The results of this study show that the expression of 2–5 AS p40 and p69 are induced by IFN-γ in these cells at 4 h and peaks at 24 h post-IFN-γ addition (Fig. 3 A). This 2–5 AS mRNA expression is consistent with the antiviral effect of IFN-γ observed in these cells when the cells are treated with IFN-γ from 4 h pre-infection and is highest when treated from 20 h pre-infection (Fig. 1) as the level of 2–5 AS is maximum at that time. The result that expression of 2–5 AS mRNA is decreased in cells treated with IFN-γ and antisense IRF-1 ODN, but not with scrambled mismatch ODN, demonstrates that the IRF-1 is involved directly in 2–5 AS induction. These data are also consistent with the reports that IRF-1 induces 2–5 AS genes, which contain consensus binding sites for IRF-1 within their promoter (30Coccia E.M. Del Russo N. Stellacci E. Orsatti R. Benedetti E. Marziali G. Hiscott J. Battistini A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Reis L.F. Harada H. Wolchok J.D. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3372-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Floyd-Smith G. Wang Q. Sen G.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 2–5 AS transcripts are induced at 4 h following IFN-γ addition, although highest expression is observed only at 24 h. This large time gap between IRF-1 expression and 2–5 AS induction could suggest involvement of other intermediates in induction of 2–5 AS. To discern whether IRF-1 directly activates 2–5 AS mRNA expression, 2–5 AS expression was examined in HEp-2 cells after the highest expression of IRF-1 (2 h of IFN-γ induction) and then by blocking protein synthesis with CHX treatment. A moderate increase in expression of 2–5 AS in CHX-treated cells compared with controls precludes involvement of other intermediates in the induction of 2–5 AS following IRF-1 up-regulation. The reason for the increase in 2–5 AS mRNA levels in CHX-treated cells is unknown. It is likely that other protein(s) synthesized following IRF-1 expression repress(es) IRF-1 induction of 2–5 AS.A significant finding of this report is the demonstration that 2–5 AS plays a central role in the antiviral activity in these cells. The abrogation of IFN-γ-mediated anti-RSV activity by treatment of cells with an equimolar mixture of antisense ODNs to p40 and p69 but not by the scrambled mismatch ODNs in a dose-dependent fashion and decrease in synthetase activity following ODN treatment provide definitive evidence supporting the role of 2–5 AS in the antiviral mechanism of IFN-γ. The 2–5 AS is pivotal to anti-RSV activity of IFN-γ, as 2–5 AS-induced 2–5A (13Saunders M.E. Gewert D.R. Tugwell M.E. McMahon M. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Silverman R.H. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: structure and function. Academic Press, NY1997: 515Crossref Google Scholar) binds to and activates RNase L, which cleaves double-stranded RNA 3′ of UpN residues (42Floyd-Smith G. Slattery E. Lengyel P. Science. 1981; 212: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 43Wreschner D.H. McCauley J.W. Skehel J.J. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1981; 289: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).In contrast to 2–5 AS, the biological activity of RNase L is controlled at the level of enzymatic activation rather than through regulation of its transcription and translation. Increasing endogenous levels of 2–5A leads to enhanced RNase L activity (44Silverman R.H. Skehel J.J. James T.C. Wreschner D.H. Kerr I.M. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that intracellular levels of 2–5A are rate-limiting in the activation of RNase L, whereas cellular levels of RNase L are sufficient for maximal biological activity. RNase L remains in an inactive form in the cells being bound to an inhibitor, RLI, which antagonizes the binding of 2–5A to RNase L, thus inhibiting the latter's dimerization, activation, and nuclease activity (45Dong B. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To dissect the role of RNase L in 2–5 AS-induced anti-RSV mechanism, RLI-14, a stable cell line overexpressing RLI, was established from HEp-2 cells and characterized. The finding that RLI-14 was almost identical to the parent HEp-2 cells in its response to IFN-γ shows that RLI overexpression does not alter the induction of ISGs in these cells (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with the report that RLI expression is not regulated by IFN-γ (15Bisbal C. Martinand C. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Salehzada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13308-13317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).The demonstration that RLI-14 cells with reduced RNase L activity exhibit a slight reduction in viral titers in the presence of IFN-γ (Fig. 6) is a significant finding as it confirms that the activation of RNase L is indeed critical to the antiviral effect of IFN-γ and that the antiviral state is controlled by the elevated expression of 2–5 AS in these cells following IFN-γ treatment. The role of RLI found in this study is consistent with that reported for human immunodeficiency virus, where RLI is induced during human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 infection and down-regulates the 2–5A/RNase L pathway in human T cells (46Martinand C. Montavon C. Salehzada T. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 290-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the reduction in antiviral effect of IFN-γ in these cells is dependent on the dose of IFN-γ, indicating that the level of 2–5 AS and, in turn, 2–5A, is also crucial to the antiviral effect of IFN-γ. A significant reduction (p < 0.01) in RSV infection is observed when HEp-2 cells are treated with 100 units/ml of IFN-γ from 20 h pre-infection and transfected with 1 μm 2–5A 2 h pre-infection when compared with the cells treated with 100 units/ml of IFN-γ alone. 2A. K. Behera and S. S. Mohapatra, unpublished observation. Thus, both 2–5 AS-induced 2–5A and RLI are major determinants of antiviral activity of cells.In summary, these results demonstrate that IFN-γ inhibits RSV infection of HEp-2 and A549 human epithelial cells and the mechanism underlying this inhibition. IFN-γ induces IRF-1, which, in turn, up-regulates 2–5 AS that generates 2–5A, the activator of RNase L. RNase L is normally found in the cytoplasm in inactive state bound to RLI. Thus, RNase L-mediated cleavage of viral RNA is governed by the yin-yang mechanism involving 2–5A and RLI. In a 2–5A-dominant state cells are protected from RSV infection because of the activation of RNase L. In contrast, an RLI-dominant condition attenuates the antiviral effect by inactivation of RNase L. Because 2–5A and RLI are, respectively, governed by IFN-γ-dependent and -independent mechanisms, treatment with IFN-γ or overexpression of 2–5 AS should provide an efficient means to redirect the 2–5A:RLI ratio toward a shift in favor of 2–5A and achieve a profound antiviral effect. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)1 is the most important cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children worldwide and is a risk factor for the development of asthma. In the United States alone, RSV causes ∼4 million cases of respiratory tract infection annually, which results in 95,000 hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths (1Carbonell-Estrany X. Quero J. Group T.I. Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 2001; 20: 874-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 2Hall C.B. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 31: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). An effective prophylaxis or treatment against RSV is not available. Intranasal administration of a plasmid expressing IFN-γ cDNA or a recombinant RSV expressing IFN-γ attenuates virus replication in mice without compromising immunogenicity (3Kumar M. Behera A.K.

IFN-γ, a type II interferon, is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in modulating nearly all phases of immune and inflammatory responses. IFNs bind to specific receptors on cells and activate a JAK-STAT (Januskinase-signal transducer andactivator of transcription) signaling cascade that culminates in the transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (5Schindler C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The Jak1 and Jak2 phosphorylate STAT-1 following the binding of IFN-γ to its receptor (5Schindler C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 6Darnell J.E., Jr. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 7Ihle J.N.

Once phosphorylated, STAT molecules dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and bind to γ-activated sequence elements present in the regulatory regions of various ISGs. The antiviral mechanism of IFN-γ may involve one or more of a number of ISG-encoded products, including interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) (8Kimura T. Nakayama K. Penninger J. Kitagawa M.

Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The RNase L is constitutively expressed in most of the mammalian cells and is found in an inactive form being bound to RNase L inhibitor, RLI, a 68-kDa protein not regulated by IFN-γ (15Bisbal C. Martinand C. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Salehzada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13308-13317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The 2–5 AS produces a series of 5′-phosphorylated and 2′- and 5′-linked oligoadenylates (2–5A) from ATP when activated by double-stranded RNA (12Clemens M.J. Williams B.R. Cell. 1978; 13: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 16Hovanessian A.G. Brown R.E. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1977; 268: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the binding of 2–5A with RNase L results in the release of RLI, dimerization, and the activation of RNase L (17Silverman R.H. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: structure and function. Academic Press, NY1997: 515Crossref Google Scholar), and subsequently activated RNase L mediates the cleavage of single-stranded RNA. However, the mechanism of the induction and activation of each of these genes vary in different cells and for the type of viruses. The mechanism of the IFN-γ-mediated antiviral activity remains to be elucidated for many clinically important viruses. Previously, we have shown that in BALB/c mice, RSV infection produces IFN-γ, which coincides with the resolution of infection (18Matsuse H. Behera A.K. Kumar M. Rabb H. Lockey R.F. Mohapatra S.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6583-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and prophylactic intranasal IFN-γ gene transfer decreases RSV replication and infection (3Kumar M. Behera A.K. Matsuse H Lockey R.F. Mohapatra S.S. Vaccine. 1999; 18: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Whereas alveolar pneumocytes are the primary target of RSV infection in mice (19Byrd L.G. Prince G.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 25: 1363-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), RSV targets epithelial cells in human airways and lungs (20Tristram D.A. Hicks W., Jr. Hard R. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 1998; 124: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this study, the mechanism of IFN-γ-mediated anti-RSV activity was investigated in the HEp-2 cells, which are normally used for RSV propagation, and in the human lung alveolar epithelial cell line A549. Our results indicate that the IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of RSV infection in human epithelial cells involves the 2–5 AS/RNase L pathway. DISCUSSIONThis report focuses on the elucidation of the mechanism underlying IFN-γ-mediated resistance to RSV infection in human epithelial cells. The salient findings from these studies are as follows. (i) IFN-γ given before or after RSV infection significantly attenuates RSV infection of human epithelial cells. (ii) Exposure of these cells to IFN-γ induces IRF-1, which, in turn, induces a key antiviral protein, 2–5 AS. (iii) The latter produces 2–5A, which activates RNase L, responsible for degradation of viral RNAs.RSV is resistant to the antiviral effects of type-I interferons and human MxA (22Atreya P.L. Kulkarni S. Virology. 1999; 261: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, the finding that treatment of HEp-2 and A549 cells from 20 h pre-infection with as low as 100 units/ml of IFN-γ inhibits RSV infection and replication when compared with untreated cells has significant therapeutic implications. HEp-2 and A549 cells treated with 1000 units/ml of IFN-γ from 20 h pre-infection to 72 h post-infection exhibited a 97% (30–31-fold in log10 plaque-forming units/ml) reduction in RSV titer. Furthermore, treatment of these cells with IFN-γ 1 h post-RSV infection without any prior treatment with IFN-γ significantly decreased (by 39%; 1.7-fold reduction in log10 plaque-forming units/ml) RSV titer. The anti-RSV effect of IFN-γ in the most permissive cell lines, such as HEp-2 and A549, implicates its potential as an important therapeutic modality against RSV infection.The mechanism of antiviral action of IFN-γ is complex and may be unique for individual cell lines and viruses. Because HEp-2 and A549 represent the most RSV-permissive epithelial cell lines, they were selected to investigate the expression profile of ISGs including IRF-1, IRF-2, PKR, and iNOS, which are potentially relevant to IFN-γ-induced antiviral activity in these cells. The results indicate that IFN-γ induces both the mRNA and protein for IRF-1 but not IRF-2. These findings in HEp-2 cells are consistent with those found for human macrophages, where IFN-γ treatment does not enhance IRF-2 gene expression, despite strong up-regulation of IRF-1 mRNA expression (35Lehtonen A. Matikainen S. Julkunen I. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 794-803PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that in non-induced cells the IRF-2 protein functions as a repressor of ISGs (36Harada H.

Here we show that C/EBPβ occurs predominantly as a heterodimer that displays rapid mobility in gel shift assays.

Many transcription factors are dimeric and can form homodimers as well as heterodimers with other family members. The capacity to heterodimerize provides a means of enhancing regulatory diversity, as the various dimeric species within a protein family may exhibit distinct functional properties (1Lamb P.

Thus, it is important to elucidate the dimerization status of transcription factors in vivo to understand the full range of their biological activities and regulation.In the present study, we have examined the dimerization properties of CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs)1 in cells. C/EBPs are a family of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding proteins (5Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L.

C/EBP proteins bind to DNA as dimers and display highly related DNA binding and dimerization specificities (reviewed in Refs. 6McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. 6.

For example, forced expression of C/EBPα and/or C/EBPβ in precursor cells of the adipocyte, granulocyte, and keratinocyte lineages causes growth arrest and induces cellular differentiation (15Darlington G.J.

Thus, C/EBPs regulate a variety of cellular phenotypes in a wide range of cell types.In addition to forming homodimers, C/EBP proteins are capable of heterodimerizing with the other family members in vitro(20Williams S.C.

Heterodimerization could potentially alter several functional activities of C/EBP proteins, including DNA binding, transactivation potential, responsiveness to signaling pathways, and the ability to cooperate with other transcription factors. It has been assumed that heterodimers between C/EBP family members occur in vivo and possess regulatory activities that are distinct from the homodimeric forms. However, there is only limited evidence for such heterodimersin vivo. An association between C/EBPα and C/EBPβ was observed in transient overexpression experiments (20Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and evidence has been reported for C/EBPα·C/EBPβ heterodimers in liver nuclear extracts (23Ossipow V.

In addition, C/EBPs appear to heterodimerize with proteins from other bZIP subfamilies, including Fos/Jun (25Hsu W. Kerppola T.K. Chen P.L. Curran T. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and can inhibit transcriptional activation by C/EBPα or C/EBPβ (31Cooper C. Henderson A. Artandi S. Avitahl N. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We show that C/EBPγ can repress C/EBPβ- and C/EBPδ-mediated transactivation of a reporter gene in fibroblasts in a leucine zipper-dependent manner, indicating that the repression by C/EBPγ involves heterodimerization with its partner. Interestingly, C/EBPγ did not repress transactivation by C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ in HepG2 hepatoma cells, nor did it inhibit C/EBPα activity in either cell type. Thus, the ability of C/EBPγ to inhibit C/EBP activators is cell-specific and differs for the various C/EBP family members.DISCUSSIONOur studies demonstrate that C/EBP activator proteins exist predominantly as heterodimers with C/EBPγ in vivo. By comparing EMSA complexes generated with recombinant C/EBPβ with those from nuclear extracts, we observed that C/EBPβ in cell lines and tissues occurs mainly as a rapidly migrating heterodimer. Antibodies specific for the NH2 and COOH termini of C/EBPγ supershifted the rapidly migrating C/EBP species, confirming that the heterodimers contain C/EBPγ. Our characterization of C/EBP heterodimers in this study has focused on C/EBPβ, because this isoform is expressed in many cell lines. However, C/EBPδ and C/EBPα also occurred as rapidly migrating heterodimers in P388 transfectants that stably express these proteins (Fig. 3 B and data not shown), as well as in transiently transfected L cells (data not shown). Thus, it seems likely that all of the C/EBP activators heterodimerize with C/EBPγ in vivo.Heterodimerization with C/EBPγ did not detectably alter the DNA-binding specificity of its C/EBP partner, because homodimers and heterodimers bound efficiently to a consensus C/EBP element. The major effect of dimerization with C/EBPγ was to repress C/EBP transactivation function. In L cells, coexpression of C/EBPγ inhibited the ability of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ to activate transcription from a C/EBP-dependent promoter. A C/EBPβ chimera containing the GCN4 leucine zipper that cannot heterodimerize with C/EBPγ was resistant to repression. C/EBPγ also suppressed transactivation by a GAL4-C/EBPβ fusion protein. Collectively, these results indicate that heterodimerization with C/EBPγ inhibits the transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ. At present it is unclear how heterodimerization with C/EBPγ suppresses transactivation. C/EBPγ lacks a TAD and by itself neither activates nor represses transcription of target genes (31Cooper C. Henderson A. Artandi S. Avitahl N. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).2 It is possible that, because C/EBP heterodimers contain only one activating subunit, they cannot efficiently stimulate transcription. Alternatively, heterodimerization with C/EBPγ might block access to a coactivator protein for which association with the C/EBP activator involves sequences in the leucine zipper and/or basic region. This possibility is currently under investigation.The fact that C/EBPγ did not repress transactivation by any of the C/EBPs in HepG2 hepatoma cells is noteworthy. Analysis of the C/EBPβ dimeric species expressed in transfected cells showed that heterodimers were produced and their levels increased in proportion to the amount of transfected C/EBPγ vector. A homodimeric C/EBPβ complex was observed in both L and HepG2 cells, and this complex did not appreciably diminish with increased C/EBPγ expression (Fig.4 B). It is possible that a pool of homodimers exists that is resistant to heterodimerization, perhaps because of a specific post-translational modification. However, because the occurrence of these persistent homodimers did not differ in the two cell types, their presence cannot account for the differential repression by C/EBPγ.Because there was no difference in heterodimer formation in HepG2 and L cells, at least as assessed by EMSA and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we postulate that C/EBP·C/EBPγ heterodimers are transcriptionally active in HepG2 cells but not in L cells. There are several potential explanations for this difference in activity. Heterodimers could be the target of activating kinases in HepG2 cells but not in L cells, whereas homodimers might be effective substrates in both cells. Such modifications could occur on either the C/EBP activator protein or the C/EBPγ subunit. It is also conceivable that protein:protein interactions mediated by the bZIP region are necessary for transcriptional activation and that heterodimeric bZIP domains are differentially active for this function in the two cell types. Irrespective of the mechanism, the ability of C/EBPγ to affect the transactivation potential of C/EBP activators in a cell-specific manner represents a novel means of controlling C/EBP activity.A mouse strain carrying a null mutation at the C/EBPγ locus has been developed (45Kaisho T. Tsutsui H. Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Kawai T. Yoshida N. Nakanishi K. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Homozygous mutant animals show grossly normal embryonic development and are initially viable after birth. However, the majority of mutant mice die within 48 h of postnatal development. Although the cause of mortality was not determined, the lethal phenotype shows that C/EBPγ has an essential function in newborn animals and presumably also in adult mice. It remains to be determined whether the lethality of C/EBPγ-deficient mice results from the absence of C/EBP heterodimers, leading to formation of homodimers with altered regulatory activities. Considering the involvement of C/EBP proteins in many biological processes and the predominance of C/EBP·C/EBPγ heterodimers in cells, it is not surprising that deletion of C/EBPγ would have severe phenotypic consequences. An additional function for C/EBPγ in lymphoid cells was revealed by analysis of bone marrow chimeras generated from C/EBPγ null donor cells (45Kaisho T. Tsutsui H. Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Kawai T. Yoshida N. Nakanishi K. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Natural killer cells derived from mutant donors display reduced cytolytic activity and impaired production of interferon-γ in response to interleukin-12 or interleukin-18 stimulation. Nevertheless, the molecular basis for defective interferon-γ gene expression in C/EBPγ-deficient natural killer cells has not been elucidated.In another study examining C/EBPγ function in vivo, Zafarana et al. (46Zafarana G. Rottier R. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5856-5863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) created transgenic mice overexpressing C/EBPγ in erythroid cells. Animals heterozygous for the C/EBPγ transgene displayed increased fetal γ-globin gene expression compared with adult β-globin expression, indicating that C/EBPγ positively regulates γ-globin transcription. However, when C/EBPγ expression was increased further by making the transgenic allele homozygous, fetal erythropoiesis was eliminated and the embryos did not survive beyond embryonic day 14.5. These results demonstrate that C/EBPγ stoichiometry critically affects development of the erythroid lineage. We suggest that the developmental defects associated with high ectopic C/EBPγ expression may result from decreased levels of C/EBP homodimers in erythroid precursor cells.In addition to regulating transcription, C/EBP proteins can induce cell growth arrest (47Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 48Buck M. Turler H. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 49Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In proliferating cell lines, C/EBP proteins occur primarily as heterodimers, raising the possibility that heterodimerization with C/EBPγ mitigates the growth arrest activity of these proteins. In experiments to create P388 cell lines expressing the zipper swap mutant, C/EBPβ-GLZ, only minimal amounts of the mutant protein were detected in stable transfectants whereas the wild type protein could be expressed at much higher levels (41Hu H.M.

This result is consistent with the idea that C/EBPβ must heterodimerize with C/EBPγ for its expression to be tolerated in proliferating cells. Furthermore, HepG2 hepatoma cells express significantly lower levels of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ than are found in normal, terminally differentiated hepatocytes (50Friedman A.D. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We speculate that C/EBPγ may be unable to suppress C/EBP-mediated growth arrest in hepatoma cells, similar to its inability to inhibit C/EBP-dependent transcription in these cells. Thus, conversion of hepatocytes to proliferating hepatoma cells might require strong down-regulation of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ expression. In future studies it will be informative to examine the ability of C/EBPγ to modulate C/EBP-mediated cell growth arrest in various cellular contexts.The observation that C/EBP activity can be inhibited by heterodimerization with C/EBPγ suggests that C/EBP dimerization might be regulated to control gene transcription. In this regard, calcium-regulated phosphorylation of a serine residue in the leucine zipper of C/EBPβ has been linked to its increased transcriptional activity (51Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism underlying this activation event has not been elucidated, the authors raised the possibility that phosphorylation of the C/EBPβ zipper might control dimerization. Our studies indicate that C/EBPγ could be involved in this putative regulatory mechanism. Although our experiments thus far have focused on artificial promoters, future studies will address potential differences between C/EBP homodimers and heterodimers in activating authentic promoters, in addition to the possibility that C/EBPγ heterodimerization is regulated by developmental cues or other physiological signals. Eukaryotic transcription factors commonly occur in families whose members share similar DNA binding specificities and other functional properties. Many transcription factors are dimeric and can form homodimers as well as heterodimers with other family members. The capacity to heterodimerize provides a means of enhancing regulatory diversity, as the various dimeric species within a protein family may exhibit distinct functional properties (1Lamb P. McKnight S.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Lee K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 9-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3La Thangue N.B.

Thus, it is important to elucidate the dimerization status of transcription factors in vivo to understand the full range of their biological activities and regulation. In the present study, we have examined the dimerization properties of CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs)1 in cells. C/EBPs are a family of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding proteins (5Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar) consisting of five core members: C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, C/EBPε, and C/EBPγ (Ig/EBP). C/EBP proteins bind to DNA as dimers and display highly related DNA binding and dimerization specificities (reviewed in Refs. 6McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. 6. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 771-795Google Scholar, 7Johnson P. Williams S.C. Yaniv M. Tronche F. Liver Gene Expression. R. G.

C/EBPs are involved in the regulation of many cellular processes. C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ mediate responses to stress and inflammatory signals, including regulation of acute phase response genes in hepatocytes and expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes in monocytic cells (9Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 10Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R.

Overexpression experiments and analysis of knockout mice demonstrate that C/EBP proteins also control cell growth and differentiation (6McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. 6.

For example, forced expression of C/EBPα and/or C/EBPβ in precursor cells of the adipocyte, granulocyte, and keratinocyte lineages causes growth arrest and induces cellular differentiation (15Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 16Radomska H.S. Huettner C.S. Zhang P. Cheng T. Scadden D.T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7181-7190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other contexts, C/EBPβ has been reported to stimulate cell growth (18Greenbaum L.E., Li, W. Cressman D.E. Peng Y. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 19Buck M. Poli V. van der Geer P. Chojkier M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, C/EBPs regulate a variety of cellular phenotypes in a wide range of cell types. In addition to forming homodimers, C/EBP proteins are capable of heterodimerizing with the other family members in vitro(20Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 21Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 22Kinoshita S. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization could potentially alter several functional activities of C/EBP proteins, including DNA binding, transactivation potential, responsiveness to signaling pathways, and the ability to cooperate with other transcription factors. It has been assumed that heterodimers between C/EBP family members occur in vivo and possess regulatory activities that are distinct from the homodimeric forms. However, there is only limited evidence for such heterodimersin vivo. An association between C/EBPα and C/EBPβ was observed in transient overexpression experiments (20Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and evidence has been reported for C/EBPα·C/EBPβ heterodimers in liver nuclear extracts (23Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and monocytic cells (24Pan Z. Hetherington C.J. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23242-23248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, C/EBPs appear to heterodimerize with proteins from other bZIP subfamilies, including Fos/Jun (25Hsu W. Kerppola T.K. Chen P.L. Curran T. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and ATF/CREB (26Vallejo M. Ron D. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we report that C/EBP proteins in cell and tissue extracts are found predominantly as heterodimers with C/EBPγ. C/EBPγ is a ubiquitously expressed member of the C/EBP family that was first identified by its affinity for cis-regulatory sites in the Ig heavy chain promoter and enhancer (29Roman C. Platero J.S. Shuman J. Calame K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1404-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). C/EBPγ contains a C/EBP-like bZIP region but lacks an amino-terminal transactivation domain (30Thomassin H. Hamel D. Bernier D. Guertin M. Belanger L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and can inhibit transcriptional activation by C/EBPα or C/EBPβ (31Cooper C. Henderson A. Artandi S. Avitahl N. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).

Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism underlying this activation event has not been elucidated, the authors raised the possibility that phosphorylation of the C/EBPβ zipper might control dimerization. Our studies indicate that C/EBPγ could be involved in this putative regulatory mechanism. Although our experiments thus far have focused on artificial promoters, future studies will address potential differences between C/EBP homodimers and heterodimers in activating authentic promoters, in addition to the possibility that C/EBPγ heterodimerization is regulated by developmental cues or other physiological signals. Our studies demonstrate that C/EBP activator proteins exist predominantly as heterodimers with C/EBPγ in vivo. By comparing EMSA complexes generated with recombinant C/EBPβ with those from nuclear extracts, we observed that C/EBPβ in cell lines and tissues occurs mainly as a rapidly migrating heterodimer. Antibodies specific for the NH2 and COOH termini of C/EBPγ supershifted the rapidly migrating C/EBP species, confirming that the heterodimers contain C/EBPγ. Our characterization of C/EBP heterodimers in this study has focused on C/EBPβ, because this isoform is expressed in many cell lines. However, C/EBPδ and C/EBPα also occurred as rapidly migrating heterodimers in P388 transfectants that stably express these proteins (Fig. 3 B and data not shown), as well as in transiently transfected L cells (data not shown). Thus, it seems likely that all of the C/EBP activators heterodimerize with C/EBPγ in vivo. Heterodimerization with C/EBPγ did not detectably alter the DNA-binding specificity of its C/EBP partner, because homodimers and heterodimers bound efficiently to a consensus C/EBP element. The major effect of dimerization with C/EBPγ was to repress C/EBP transactivation function. In L cells, coexpression of C/EBPγ inhibited the ability of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ to activate transcription from a C/EBP-dependent promoter. A C/EBPβ chimera containing the GCN4 leucine zipper that cannot heterodimerize with C/EBPγ was resistant to repression. C/EBPγ also suppressed transactivation by a GAL4-C/EBPβ fusion protein. Collectively, these results indicate that heterodimerization with C/EBPγ inhibits the transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ. At present it is unclear how heterodimerization with C/EBPγ suppresses transactivation. C/EBPγ lacks a TAD and by itself neither activates nor represses transcription of target genes (31Cooper C. Henderson A. Artandi S. Avitahl N. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).2 It is possible that, because C/EBP heterodimers contain only one activating subunit, they cannot efficiently stimulate transcription. Alternatively, heterodimerization with C/EBPγ might block access to a coactivator protein for which association with the C/EBP activator involves sequences in the leucine zipper and/or basic region. This possibility is currently under investigation. The fact that C/EBPγ did not repress transactivation by any of the C/EBPs in HepG2 hepatoma cells is noteworthy. Analysis of the C/EBPβ dimeric species expressed in transfected cells showed that heterodimers were produced and their levels increased in proportion to the amount of transfected C/EBPγ vector. A homodimeric C/EBPβ complex was observed in both L and HepG2 cells, and this complex did not appreciably diminish with increased C/EBPγ expression (Fig.4 B). It is possible that a pool of homodimers exists that is resistant to heterodimerization, perhaps because of a specific post-translational modification. However, because the occurrence of these persistent homodimers did not differ in the two cell types, their presence cannot account for the differential repression by C/EBPγ. Because there was no difference in heterodimer formation in HepG2 and L cells, at least as assessed by EMSA and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we postulate that C/EBP·C/EBPγ heterodimers are transcriptionally active in HepG2 cells but not in L cells. There are several potential explanations for this difference in activity. Heterodimers could be the target of activating kinases in HepG2 cells but not in L cells, whereas homodimers might be effective substrates in both cells. Such modifications could occur on either the C/EBP activator protein or the C/EBPγ subunit. It is also conceivable that protein:protein interactions mediated by the bZIP region are necessary for transcriptional activation and that heterodimeric bZIP domains are differentially active for this function in the two cell types. Irrespective of the mechanism, the ability of C/EBPγ to affect the transactivation potential of C/EBP activators in a cell-specific manner represents a novel means of controlling C/EBP activity. A mouse strain carrying a null mutation at the C/EBPγ locus has been developed (45Kaisho T. Tsutsui H. Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Kawai T. Yoshida N. Nakanishi K. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Homozygous mutant animals show grossly normal embryonic development and are initially viable after birth. However, the majority of mutant mice die within 48 h of postnatal development. Although the cause of mortality was not determined, the lethal phenotype shows that C/EBPγ has an essential function in newborn animals and presumably also in adult mice. It remains to be determined whether the lethality of C/EBPγ-deficient mice results from the absence of C/EBP heterodimers, leading to formation of homodimers with altered regulatory activities. Considering the involvement of C/EBP proteins in many biological processes and the predominance of C/EBP·C/EBPγ heterodimers in cells, it is not surprising that deletion of C/EBPγ would have severe phenotypic consequences. An additional function for C/EBPγ in lymphoid cells was revealed by analysis of bone marrow chimeras generated from C/EBPγ null donor cells (45Kaisho T. Tsutsui H. Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Kawai T. Yoshida N. Nakanishi K. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Natural killer cells derived from mutant donors display reduced cytolytic activity and impaired production of interferon-γ in response to interleukin-12 or interleukin-18 stimulation. Nevertheless, the molecular basis for defective interferon-γ gene expression in C/EBPγ-deficient natural killer cells has not been elucidated. In another study examining C/EBPγ function in vivo, Zafarana et al. (46Zafarana G. Rottier R. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5856-5863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) created transgenic mice overexpressing C/EBPγ in erythroid cells. Animals heterozygous for the C/EBPγ transgene displayed increased fetal γ-globin gene expression compared with adult β-globin expression, indicating that C/EBPγ positively regulates γ-globin transcription. However, when C/EBPγ expression was increased further by making the transgenic allele homozygous, fetal erythropoiesis was eliminated and the embryos did not survive beyond embryonic day 14.5. These results demonstrate that C/EBPγ stoichiometry critically affects development of the erythroid lineage. We suggest that the developmental defects associated with high ectopic C/EBPγ expression may result from decreased levels of C/EBP homodimers in erythroid precursor cells. In addition to regulating transcription, C/EBP proteins can induce cell growth arrest (47Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 48Buck M. Turler H. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 49Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In proliferating cell lines, C/EBP proteins occur primarily as heterodimers, raising the possibility that heterodimerization with C/EBPγ mitigates the growth arrest activity of these proteins. In experiments to create P388 cell lines expressing the zipper swap mutant, C/EBPβ-GLZ, only minimal amounts of the mutant protein were detected in stable transfectants whereas the wild type protein could be expressed at much higher levels (41Hu H.M. Tian Q. Baer M. Spooner C.J. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16373-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the idea that C/EBPβ must heterodimerize with C/EBPγ for its expression to be tolerated in proliferating cells. Furthermore, HepG2 hepatoma cells express significantly lower levels of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ than are found in normal, terminally differentiated hepatocytes (50Friedman A.D. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We speculate that C/EBPγ may be unable to suppress C/EBP-mediated growth arrest in hepatoma cells, similar to its inability to inhibit C/EBP-dependent transcription in these cells. Thus, conversion of hepatocytes to proliferating hepatoma cells might require strong down-regulation of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ expression. In future studies it will be informative to examine the ability of C/EBPγ to modulate C/EBP-mediated cell growth arrest in various cellular contexts. The observation that C/EBP activity can be inhibited by heterodimerization with C/EBPγ suggests that C/EBP dimerization might be regulated to control gene transcription. In this regard, calcium-regulated phosphorylation of a serine residue in the leucine zipper of C/EBPβ has been linked to its increased transcriptional activity (51Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G.

Secretions of the airways contain proteins that have direct antimicrobial activity (lysozyme, lactoferrin, defensins, and cathelicidins) as well as complement factors and surfactant proteins that contribute to host defense. The hydrophobic surfactant protein C (SP-C) recognizes LPS (Augusto, L., Le Blay, K., Auger, G., Blanot, D., and Chaby, R. (2001) Am. J. Physiol. 281, L776–L785). In the present study, using synthetic analogs of SP-C, we demonstrate that the palmitoyl residues of SP-C are not required for the interaction with LPS and that both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of SP-C are required for specific binding of a radiolabeled rough-type LPS. In addition, using LPS submitted to different chemical treatments as well as synthetic analogs of the lipid A moiety of LPS, we established that the terminal phosphate group at the reducing end of the lipid A disaccharide in α configuration is of crucial importance for recognition by SP-C. The N-linked fatty acyl chain on the reducing glucosamine of lipid A also takes part in the interaction. Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine is not specifically required for the LPS-binding activity of SP-C, although a lipid environment significantly increases the binding. These results provide a basis for experiments on the role of SP-C in presentation of LPS to alveolar cells and for the design of drugs for the management of endotoxin-induced lung injury.

Infection of the lung is one of the most frequent causes of morbidity and death. Many pathogens also release constituents or produce factors that further damage the host defense system, thus facilitating spread of the organisms. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS),1 also termed endotoxin, of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria can initiate a cascade of biochemical and cellular events leading to multiple organ dysfunction and death (1Parrillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). The lung is often involved in such organ failure, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome with a high (over 50%) mortality rate (2Fowler A.A. Hamman R.F. Good J.T. Benson K.N. Baird M. Eberle D.J. Petty T.L. Hyers T.M. Ann. Intern. Med. 1983; 98: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). To prevent these deleterious effects, the host has developed an innate, non-adaptive defense system, which includes factors that detect bacterial products and prepare their recognition by cellular receptors, and a family of pattern-recognition receptors that interact with common bacterial motifs. Some of the recognition molecules are present on the surface of different cell types (CD14, TLR2, and TLR4), whereas others are soluble proteins (LBP, conglutinin, CL-43) (3Holmskov U. Teisner B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. Jensenius J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10120-10125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the lungs, the alveolar fluid contains regulatory molecules that are capable of sensing the environment and amplifying or dampening inflammatory responses. Lung surfactant, which covers the epithelial lining of the alveoli, contains several components that are active participants in the innate defense system. Two hydrophilic components, SP-A and SP-D, are lung collectins that can modulate the function of phagocytic cells (4Eggleton P. Reid K.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SP-A and SP-D can interact with a wide range of microorganisms and their components (endotoxin, lipoteichoic acid, and mannans), and a role in pattern recognition has been proposed for these collectins (5Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). Particularly, it has been shown that both SP-A and SP-D can bind LPS (6Kalina M. Blau H. Riklis S. Kravtsov V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L144-L151PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lim B.L. Wang J.Y. Holmskov U. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The hydrophobic surfactant protein SP-B is mainly involved in the surface tension-lowering activity of pulmonary surfactant. Inherited deficiency of SP-B in human infants (12Nogee L.M. Garnier G.

The second hydrophobic surfactant protein, SP-C, is produced exclusively by type II alveolar epithelial cells, whereas SP-A, SP-B, and SP-D can also be produced by non-ciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells (14Crouch E. Parghi D. Kuan S.F. Persson A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L60-L66PubMed Google Scholar), SP-A is expressed in rat intestine (15Rubio S. Lacaze-Masmonteil T. Chailley-Heu B. Kahn A. Bourbon J.R. Ducroc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12162-12169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), SP-D is found on other extra-pulmonary mucosal surfaces (16Madsen J. Kliem A. Tornoe I. Skjodt K. Koch C. Holmskov U. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5866-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and SP-A and SP-D are expressed in the Eustachian tube (17Hallman M. Paananen R. Glumoff V. Lahti M. Löfgren J. Marttila R. Rämet M. Biol. Neonate. 2001; 80: 36-37Google Scholar). Characterization of the structure of SP-C has revealed many uncommon features (18Johansson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), but the function of this peptide in vivoremains unclear. SP-C null mice show no signs of respiratory dysfunction, but the resistance to lung infections was not tested in the initial report (19Glasser S.W. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R., Na, C.L. Sly P.D.

SP-C may play an important role in the defense capacities of pulmonary surfactant, because its presence in aerosolized surfactant improves pulmonary function in endotoxin-induced lung injury (20Lutz C. Carney D. Finck C. Picone A. Gatto L.A. Paskanik A. Langenback E. Nieman G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this connection, we demonstrated recently (21Augusto L., Le Blay K. Auger G. Blanot D. Chaby R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L776-L785PubMed Google Scholar) that lipopolysaccharides of different bacterial origins interact with lipid vesicles containing SP-C and that this binding is saturable, temperature-dependent, and related to the concentrations of SP-C and LPS. In this study, our goals were to characterize which regions of LPS and SP-C are involved in this interaction and to determine the role of a lipid environment in the binding of the two molecules. Synthetic dipalmitoyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine, egg yolkl-α-phosphatidylcholine (type XV-E), cholesterol, tripalmitin, bovine serum albumin, porcine trypsin, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS), and LPS fromSalmonella minnesota (rough mutant Re595), were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). o-Phthalaldehyde was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Tritium-labeled borohydride (481 GBq/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, England). All HPLC solvents (LiChrosolv grade) were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The liquid scintillation reagent Aqualyte was from Baker (Deventer, The Netherlands). The labeling was done by a modification of the procedure of Watson and Riblet (22Watson J. Riblet R. J. Immunol. 1975; 114: 1462-1468PubMed Google Scholar): A sample (2 mg) of LPS from S. minnesota Re595 was oxidized (150 min, 20 °C) with sodium periodate (3 × 10−2m). After destruction of the oxidant with 1 methylene glycol, aldehyde groups were reduced (18 h at 4 °C) with an ice-cold solution of NaB[3H]4 (0.46 GBq, 481 GBq/mmol) in 200 μl of ice-cold borate buffer (0.05 m, pH 9.5). Excess sodium borohydride was destroyed with 5 μl of acetic acid. After two washings (centrifugations at 100,000 ×g for 15 min) in 400 μl of an ice-cold water-ethanol mixture (1:1, v/v), the radiolabeled [3H]LPS (9 × 105 cpm/μg, 2 × 103 cpm/pmol) was stored at −20 °C until use. Nitric oxide production induced by 2 and 5 ng/ml of this radiolabeled material in mouse macrophages was not significantly different from that induced by the same concentrations of unlabeled LPS, indicating that the bioactivity of the LPS was not modified by the radiolabeling procedure. Mouse and rabbit SP-C were prepared as described previously (21Augusto L., Le Blay K. Auger G. Blanot D. Chaby R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L776-L785PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, crude surfactant was isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage of 5- 10-week-old Swiss mice, or adult rabbit, on a NaCl/NaBr density gradient, as described by Katyalet al. (23Katyal S.L. Estes L.W. Lombardi B. Lab. Invest. 1977; 36: 585-592PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrophobic constituents (SP-B, SP-C, and phospholipids) were recovered by extraction (1 h, 4 °C) in a mixture of chloroform/methanol/1 m HCl (60:40:0.1, v/v) and centrifugation (10 min, 12,000 × g). After sonication in a solution of 5 mm Tris-HCl and 75 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) and removal of phospholipids by extraction with a mixture of diisopropylether/1-butanol (3:2, v/v), the hydrophobic surfactant components were isolated at the interphase. SP-C was isolated from this mixture by reverse-phase HPLC. Porcine SP-C was prepared as described previously (24Curstedt T. Jornvall H. Robertson B. Bergman T. Berggren P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 25Gustafsson M. Curstedt T. Jornvall H. Johansson J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, minced porcine lungs were washed with saline, and the mixture was filtered. After removal of cells and debris, surfactant material was pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and the lipid extract obtained was then purified by chromatography over Lipidx 5000 in ethylene chloride/methanol (1:4, v/v), Sephadex LH-60 in chloroform/methanol/0.1m HCl (19:19:2, v/v), and finally by reverse-phase HPLC over a C18 column, using aqueous ethanol or methanol as the mobile phase and a linear gradient of 2-propanol for elution. Samples of the hydrophobic material extracted from mouse or rabbit surfactant (five mouse or 0.2 rabbit equivalents) were dissolved in 100 μl of solvent A (0.2% trifluoroacetic acid and 75% methanol in water) and applied on a C18 column from Waters (μBondapak C18, 10 μm, 300 × 3.9 mm). Analysis was carried out at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min, first with solvent A for 10 min and then with a linear gradient (2.5% per min for 30 min) of solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 2-propanol) in solvent A. Absorbance of the effluent was monitored at 225 nm. The syntheses of the monosaccharide-derived lipid A analogs, performed by D. Charon and M. Mondange, have been described previously (26Charon D.

Palmitoylation of the serine hydroxyl groups of SP-C(Leu) was performed by addition of palmitoyl chloride to the peptide dissolved in neat trifluoroacetic acid, quenching of the reaction with aqueous ethanol, removal of palmitic acid by chromatography over Lipidx 5000 in ethylene chloride/methanol (1:4, v/v), and final peptide purification by reverse-phase HPLC (30Yousefi-Salakdeh E.

Chaby R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L776-L785PubMed Google Scholar): Glass tubes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) (0.3 mg) alone or mixed with SP-C or peptide analogs were evaporated to dryness. After sonication with a solution of BSA (60 μl, 1 mg/ml in 0.15 m NaCl), [3H]LPS (3.6 × 105 cpm, 290 μl in 0.15 m NaCl) was added and the mixture was incubated (2 h, 20 °C) under gentle rotation. The mixture was adjusted to 1.185 g/ml by addition of 350 μl of a solution of 1.1% NaCl and 46% NaBr. A discontinuous gradient was prepared by sequential addition of 23% NaCl (0.7 ml), the sample mixture (0.7 ml), 20.5% NaCl (0.7 ml), 16.5% NaCl (0.7 ml), and 8% NaCl (0.2 ml). After centrifugation (65,000 × g, 90 min), the radioactivity of collected fractions was determined by liquid scintillation. Vesicles with bound radiolabeled LPS were recovered at the top (1 ml) of the density gradient, whereas unbound [3H]LPS was found at the bottom. The LPS binding index (LBI) of a compound is defined as the radioactivity recovered at the top (1 ml) of the density gradient, expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity recovered. A second LPS binding assay based on the binding of [3H]LPS to SP-C-coated plates was also designed: Solvent-resistant (polypropylene) microplates were coated with a mixture of tripalmitin and cholesterol (100 μg/well each). On the dried film, a solution (100 μl) of SP-C/LKS (200 pmol) in a chloroform-methanol (1:1) mixture was added. After evaporation, the film was incubated at room temperature with [3H]LPS (360,000 cpm), in the presence or absence of unlabeled LPS, in a binding medium (100 μl) containing bovine serum albumin (50 μg) in saline. After 3 h of incubation, the plates were washed three times with 100 μl of saline, and the remaining bound radioactivity was measured. The amount of palmitate released from SP-C by triethylamine treatment was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. After incubation (150 min, 37 °C) of 80 pmol of murine SP-C (one mouse equivalent) with 0.6 m triethylamine in 300 μl of a chloroform/methanol mixture (1:1, v/v), the pH was adjusted to 2 with HCl. The mixture was dried, and free fatty acids were methylated with diazomethane and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography on an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm). A two-step temperature gradient starting at 130 °C (3 °C/min for 10 min, followed by 4 °C/min for 20 min) was used. The amount of methyl palmitate was determined by comparison of the integrated area of the corresponding peak with that of a methyl palmitate standard (from Sigma Chemical Co.). Samples (200 pmol) of natural SP-C and synthetic peptides, mixed with synthetic PC and recovered at the top (1 ml) of the density gradient used in the LPS binding assay, were centrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 ×g to remove salts. Pellets were lyophilized and hydrolyzed (105 °C, 72 h) in 400 μl of 6 m HCl. After evaporation under vacuum, the dried material was dissolved in 100 μl of a 1 m borate buffer (pH 10.6). Amino acids in the hydrolysates were estimated by reaction with a fluorogenic reagent (32Benson J.R. Hare P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar): Fractions (10 μl) of these samples were added to borate buffer (40 μl) in wells of a microplate. A reagent (50 μl) consisting of 9 ml of borate buffer (1 m, pH 10.6), 150 μl ofo-phthalaldehyde (10 mg/ml in ethanol), and 150 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (5 μl/ml in ethanol) was added. After incubation for 5 min at 20 °C, in triplicates, the plate was excited at 355 nm and scanned at 460 nm in a Victor microplate fluorometer (Model 1420-002, Wallac-Berthold Instruments, Milton Keynes, UK). Fluorescence intensities of the hydrolysates were compared with those of an alanine standard. The ability of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) to become highly fluorescent (33Chantres J.R. Sainz M.C. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 74-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) while embedded in a lipid environment can be used to determine the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of a solution. Starting from a 23 mm solution, 24 serial 2-fold dilutions of the synthetic glycolipids, in 200 μm of freshly dissolved ANS, were prepared in wells of a microplate (50 μl/well). After 2 min, the plate was excited at 405 nm and scanned at 460 nm in a Victor microplate fluorometer (Model 1420-002). The fluorescence was plotted (linear scale) versus the concentration of the glycolipid (log scale). Linear regressions at low and high concentrations of the glycolipid were drawn. The abscissa of the intersection point of these two straight lines represented the CMC of the glycolipid. We reported previously that mouse SP-C can interact with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (21Augusto L., Le Blay K. Auger G. Blanot D. Chaby R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L776-L785PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if this observation can be extended to SP-C from other origins, rabbit SP-C was isolated from surfactant recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage of rabbit lung and purified by HPLC (compound eluted between 26 and 28 min), as described for the preparation of mouse SP-C. Porcine SP-C was prepared from minced porcine lungs by chromatography in organic solvents (24Curstedt T. Jornvall H. Robertson B. Bergman T. Berggren P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Fractions of these compounds giving HPLC peaks of similar intensities (167 pmol according to quantitative amino acid analysis of mouse SP-C) were incorporated into PC/BSA vesicles, and the binding of [3H]LPS to the vesicles was measured as described previously (21Augusto L., Le Blay K. Auger G. Blanot D. Chaby R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L776-L785PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the LPS binding indexes of 167 pmol of mouse, rabbit, and porcine SP-C were of 80.4 ± 5.1%, 79.5 ± 6.0%, and 66.1 ± 9.1%, respectively. These results show that LPS can interact with SP-C produced by different animal species. Tritium-labeled LPS was submitted to chemical treatments generally used for selective removal of particular residues such as mild alkaline, hydrazine, and aqueous hydrogen fluoride. Karibian et al. (34Karibian D. Brunelle A. Aussel L. Caroff M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 2252-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) established that fatty acyl chains linked at the C3 and C3′ positions of lipid A are more labile than esters at other positions and can be selectively released by a mild alkaline treatment (0.25 m NaOH at 37 °C for 10–25 min depending on the LPS used). Treatment with hydrazine (37 °C, 30 min) is often used to remove selectively all ester-linked fatty acids (35Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Gibson B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Knirel Y.A. Helbig J.H. Zahringer U. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 283: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and treatment with aqueous HF (4 °C, 48 h) is classically used to completely dephosphorylate LPS preparations (36Knirel Y.A. Helbig J.H. Zahringer U. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 283: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,37Rahman M.M., Gu, X.X. Tsai C.M. Kolli V.S. Carlson R.W. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To examine the influence of fatty acid and phosphate residues of LPS on the interaction between LPS and SP-C, [3H]LPS was submitted to the three treatments mentioned above, and the binding of the resulting LPS derivatives to PC/BSA vesicles containing SP-C was determined. The results (Table I) show that LPS was still fully recognized by SP-C after removal of the fatty acyl chains at C3 and C3′. The interaction was reduced, but persisted at rather high levels, after complete removal of ester linked fatty acids. In contrast, LPS dephosphorylated by HF treatment was no more recognized by SP-C.Table IInfluence of chemical treatments of [ 3 H]LPS on the binding to SP-CVesicles of PC/BSATreatment of [3H]LPSLPS binding index %Without SP-CNone9.6 ± 1.2With 60 pmol of SP-CNone82.6 ± 5.50.25m NaOH, 37 °C, 25 min71.3 ± 5.898% Hydrazine, 37 °C, 30 min51.6 ± 4.048% HF, 4 °C, 48 h11.2 ± 0.1Vesicles of PC/BSA (300 μg/60 μg) without SP-C or containing 60 pmol of HPLC-purified mouse SP-C were incubated (2 h, 20 °C) with samples of [3H]LPS (3.5 × 105 cpm) submitted to various chemical treatments. The percentage of radioactivity bound to the vesicles (LPS binding index) was determined on the fraction recovered at the top (1 ml) of a NaCl/NaBr gradient. Results are the mean ± S.D. of duplicates. Open table in a new tab Vesicles of PC/BSA (300 μg/60 μg) without SP-C or containing 60 pmol of HPLC-purified mouse SP-C were incubated (2 h, 20 °C) with samples of [3H]LPS (3.5 × 105 cpm) submitted to various chemical treatments. The percentage of radioactivity bound to the vesicles (LPS binding index) was determined on the fraction recovered at the top (1 ml) of a NaCl/NaBr gradient. Results are the mean ± S.D. of duplicates. One specific feature of SP-C is that it contains two palmitoyl chains covalently attached via S-ester bonds to cysteine residues of the polypeptide chain. S-ester bonds are easily cleaved by mild alkaline treatment (38Schmidt M.F. Bracha M. Schlesinger M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1687-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To determine whether the SP-C palmitoyl residues play a role in the interaction with LPS, HPLC-purified mouse SP-C (2 mouse equivalents) was incubated for 150 min at 37 °C with 300 μl of 0.6 m triethylamine in a chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) mixture. After this alkaline treatment, analysis of the sample by HPLC indicated that deacylation was complete (Fig. 1): the initial SP-C peak disappeared, and the deacylated material was detected as major new peak (elution time, 18 min). A small peak (elution time, 30.5 min), identical to that obtained by triethylamine treatment of tripalmitin, is attributable to palmitic acid as demonstrated by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of its methyl ester derivative (data not shown). We also determined by GLC the total amount of palmitic acid released during the triethylamine treatment of SP-C (integration of the GLC peak and comparison to a standard). We found that the two palmitoyl residues of SP-C were quantitatively removed (data not shown). Replicates of untreated and deacylated murine SP-C were then analyzed for LPS-binding activity. The LPS binding indexes (71 and 35%, respectively) indicated that mouse SP-C is still able to bind LPS after deacylation. We also found that the major HPLC peak obtained after deacylation (elution time, 18 min) was the only fraction of the HPLC chromatogram that was able to bind LPS. The decrease of the LPS binding index after deacylation is likely due to reduced conformational stability of the peptide (39Gustafsson M. Griffiths W.J. Furusjo E. Johansson J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although contribution from partial degradation of the polypeptide chain cannot be excluded. To avoid the risk of such side-reactions we decided to use synthetic analogs of SP-C rather than the chemically modified derivatives. Several synthetic analogs of SP-C were incorporated into vesicles of PC/BSA (50–400 pmol of the analogs, 300 μg of PC, and 60 μg of BSA), which were examined for LPS-binding ability. We used SP-C(LKS) and SP-C(Leu), two non-palmitoylated analogs of human SP-C; anO,O-dipalmitoylated derivative of SP-C(Leu); SP-C-(1–21), an analog corresponding to the first 21 amino acids of porcine SP-C; and SP-C/BR, which contains a hydrophilic N-terminal region identical to that of porcine SP-C linked to a 23-residue segment that corresponds to the second transmembrane helix of bacteriorhodopsin. The primary structures of these SP-C analogs are given in Fig. 2. The results of the binding of [3H]LPS to vesicles containing these synthetic analogs (TableII) show that, in line with the result mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the palmitoyl groups of SP-C do not play a role in the LPS-binding capacity of the molecules. Indeed, the O,O-dipalmitoyl derivative of SP-C(Leu) does not bind LPS better than the non-palmitoylated form. Furthermore, two other non-palmitoylated peptides, SP-C(LKS) and SP-C/BR, also bind LPS. It should be noted that 100% of the four peptides was inserted into the lipid vesicles and recovered at the top of the density gradient, as assessed by the amino acid content of the recovered fractions, determined by a fluorometric acid assay after strong acid hydrolysis (data not shown).Table IIBinding of [ 3 H]LPS to vesicles of natural and synthetic SP-CCompoundAmountLPS binding index pmol2-aA fluorometric amino acid assay indicated that the percentage of peptide recovered in the top fraction (1 ml) of the gradient was of 89% for SP-C-(1–21) and 100% for all the other peptides. %None-6 ± 1Natural porcine SP-C5026 ± 310038 ± 120069 ± 4SP-C/BR20075 ± 340083 ± 2SP-C-(1–21)2005 ± 14005 ± 2SP-C(LKS)20070 ± 040077 ± 1SP-C(Leu)5021 ± 110033 ± 120058 ± 140071 ± 1Dipalmitoylated SP-C(Leu)5026 ± 110030 ± 220060 ± 240064 ± 1Vesicles of PC/BSA (300 μg/60 μg) containing natural porcine SP-C or different synthetic SP-C analogs (50–400 pmol) were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C with 0.5 nmol/ml (3.4 × 105 cpm) of [3H]LPS.

CoA is also involved in the regulation of several key reactions in intermediary metabolism. It is estimated that about 4% of all cellular enzymes utilize CoA or its thioester derivatives as substrates. The biosynthesis of CoA in mammalian cells occurs in five steps, which utilize pantothenate (vitamin B5), ATP, and cysteine (4Tahiliani A.G. Beinlich C.J. Vitam. Horm. 1991; 46: 165-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the first step, pantothenic acid is phosphorylated to 4′-phosphopantothenic acid in a reaction mediated by pantothenate kinase. This is a rate-limiting step in CoA biosynthesis, and the activity of pantothenate kinase is strongly inhibited by coenzyme A and all of its acyl esters (5Fisher M.N. Robishaw J.D. Neely J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15745-15751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6411-6417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yun M. Park C.G. Kim J.Y.

The product of the first reaction is then converted to 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine, which is subsequently decarboxylated to 4′-phosphopantotheine. The 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthase and phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase catalyze these two reactions, respectively. Another rate-limiting step in this biosynthetic pathway involves the conversion of 4′-PP to dPCoA by 4′-phosphopantotheine adenylyltransferase. Dephospho-CoA kinase phosphorylates the 3′-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring of dPCoA in the final stage of CoA biosynthesis. The tissue level of CoA is regulated by various extracellular stimuli, including hormones, nutrients, and cellular metabolites. It has been shown that insulin, glucose, fatty acids, pyruvate, and ketone bodies inhibit CoA biosynthesis, while glucocorticoids and glucagon, as well as drugs such as clofibrate, increase tissue concentration of CoA (8Robishaw J.D.

Enzymatic activities responsible for each step of CoA biosynthesis have been purified from various mammalian sources and characterized. However, these studies have not been extended into protein sequence analysis and cDNA cloning of enzymes involved in the pathway of CoA biogenesis. Recently, bioinformatic studies led to the identification and characterization of a gene and a cDNA coding for mammalian pantothenate kinase (20Calder R.B. Williams R.S. Ramaswamy G. Rock C.O.

Sequence alignments, mutational analysis, and biochemical characterization indicated that CoAsy possesses two enzymatic domains, which mediate the last two steps in CoA biosynthesis: conversion of 4′-PP into dPCoA and subsequently into CoA. HEK293 cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Anti-Myc (9E-10) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz. A His-tag fusion protein, containing the C-terminal domain of CoAsy (His-dCoAK) was used to raise specific polyclonal antibodies. Immunoreactive sera were affinity-purified on an Actigel matrix containing His-dPCoAK fusion protein. The DupLEX-A yeast two-hybrid system was used in this study (OriGENE Technologies). The pEG202/S6Kα “bait” construct was created by standard cloning techniques and used to screen a mouse embryo cDNA library. Autoactivation assay, testing for nuclear localization of the bait fusion protein, selection of positive clones, and mating assay were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. A mouse tissue mRNA blot (a generous gift from Dr. V. Buchman) was hybridized with an 850-bp cDNA fragment of CoAsy. The probe was labeled using the ReadiprimeTMII random prime labeling kit from AmershamBiosciences. Chicken β-actin cDNA probe was used as a control. Homogenates of adult rat tissues and cell lines were prepared in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Diagnostics). A portion of total lysate (40 μg) from each tissue and cell line was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with affinity-purified anti-CoAsy antibodies. Full-length CoAsy was amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) in frame with the N-terminal Myc-tag epitope. The dPCoAK domain was cloned into pET23d plasmid (Novagene) in-frame with His-tag sequences, located at the N terminus. Expression and affinity purification of His-dPCoAK was carried out in BL21 DE3 cells and on NTA-agarose, respectively. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells was performed using Polyfect under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Immunoprecipitation assays and Western blot analysis were carried out as described previously (22Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30061-30064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate a point mutation in the PPAT domain (His203 to Ala). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The PPAT activity of CoAsy was measured as described below. The immunoprecipitates, containing Myc-CoAsy were mixed with 0.2 mm 4′-PP, 0.25 mm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, in BB1 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm DTT). The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Reaction products were separated by descending paper chromatography using Whatman 3MM paper and developing system containing isobutyric acid:0.5 n ammonium hydroxide (100:60) and 1 mm EDTA (23Bucovaz E.T. Tarnowski S.J. Morrison W.C. Macleod R.M. Morrison J.C. Sobhy C.M. Rhoades J.L. Fryer J.E. Wakim J.M. Whybrew W.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 30: 7-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A phosphoimager system (Bio-Rad) was used to identify the position of radiolabelled products. Dephospho-CoA kinase activity of immune complexes or recombinant His-dPCoAK was assayed at 25 °C for 30 min in buffer containing 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2,1.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm dPCoA, 0.25 mmATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction products were separated and analyzed in the same way as described above for the PPAT assay. Both PPAT and dPCoAK activities were also measured spectrophotometrically using enzymatic systems as described previously (24Geerlof A. Lewendon A. Shaw W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27105-27111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Using the full-length coding sequence of ribosomal S6 kinase αII (S6KαII) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse embryo cDNA library, we isolated 16 positive clones, which were confirmed by mating assay. Restriction analysis and DNA sequencing revealed that 13 clones contained the same insert. One of these cDNA clones, designated Ukr1, was fully sequenced and found to have an open reading frame that translated into a protein of 563 amino acids (Fig.1). The deduced amino acid sequence has a calculated molecular weight of 62,023. Sequence alignments indicated that the central region of Ukr1 shows high homology to phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferases, which belong to the superfamily of cytidylyltransferases (Supplementary data, Fig. 1A). The C-terminal region is highly homologous to the catalytic domain of dephospho-CoA kinases (Supplementary data, Fig. 1B). The N terminus of Ukr1 does not exhibit signatures of any known domains or motifs. The presence of PPAT and dPCoAK domains strongly indicated that Ukr1 cDNA might encode a protein involved in the biosynthesis of CoA. This was an interesting observation, as there is a previous report describing purification of an enzyme from pig liver possessing both PPAT and dPCoAK activities (25Worrall D.M. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This bi-functional enzyme with a molecular mass of ∼57 kDa was termed CoA synthase, as it had the potential to mediate the final stages of CoA biosynthesis. As the protein was never sequenced and the gene was not identified, the hypothesis of a bifunctional CoA synthase was never formally proven. Based on the observation that Ukr1 contained domains predicted to have both PPAT and dPCoAK activities combined with the fact that the Ukr1 gene product has a predicted molecular mass of 62 kDa, we hypothesized that Ukr1 cDNA encoded CoA synthase. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that homologues of mouse Ukr1/CoAsy are present in Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster,Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, andSaccharomyces cerevisiae and exhibit 87, 33, 28, 29, and 23% homology at the protein level, respectively (Fig. 1 A). To our knowledge, none of the gene products of these data base entries have been biochemically characterized nor shown to possess PPAT and/or dPCoAK activities. It is important to note that in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes PPAT and dPCoAK activities reside on different proteins (Fig. 1 B). The merger of both enzymatic activities in higher eukaryotes suggests the existence of a novel, more recently evolved mechanism in the regulation of CoA biosynthesis. Moreover, the N-terminal extension is only present in eukaryotes and might contain some regulatory sequences. Interestingly, the C. eleganshomologue contains a highly hydrophobic insert in the middle of dPCoAK domain and a hydrophobic C-terminal extension. The expression level of CoAsy in tissues and cell lines was examined by Northern and Western blot analysis. Probing of total RNA from mouse tissues with a radioactively labeled fragment of CoAsy revealed a major transcript of 2.3 kb and two minor bands at around 1.7 and 2 kb (Fig.2 A). The highest expression levels were found in kidney and liver, whereas colon, lung, intestine, and spleen showed the lowest levels of transcripts. The probe of chicken β-actin cDNA was used as a control (Fig 2 A,lower panel). To analyze expression of CoAsy at the protein level, the C-terminal region of CoAsy containing the dPCoAK domain was expressed in bacteria as His-tag fusion protein (His-dPCoAK). Recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography on NTA-agarose and used to generate polyclonal antibodies. Affinity-purified antibodies specifically recognized His-dPCoAK and the full-length Myc-CoAsy in Western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments (Supplementary data, Fig. 2). When rat tissue lysates were immunoblotted with anti-CoAsy antibody, a major immunoreactive band was observed at around 60 kDa, which was slightly lower than recombinant Myc-CoAsy expressed in HEK293 cells. CoAsy expression is high in kidney, liver, and brain, whereas ovaries and lung express low levels of the protein (Fig. 2 B). There is a good correlation between CoAsy tissue expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels. Immunoblotting also revealed that CoAsy was present in a wide range of cell lines including 3T3-L1 adipocytes and J774.4 macrophages (Fig. 2 C). Therefore we conclude that CoAsy is a widely distributed enzyme, but particularly significant levels of expression are observed in tissues exhibiting elevated lipid metabolism such as heart, liver, and fat. To determine whether the CoAsy cDNA encodes a protein possessing the predicted enzymatic activities, Myc-tagged CoAsy was expressed in HEK293 cells and recombinant protein immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Immune complexes were divided and assayed for PPAT and dPCoAK activities as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When dPCoA was used as a substrate, the appearance of radioactively labeled CoA was detected by descending paper chromatography (Fig.3 A). Bacterial preparations of His-dPCoAK domain were also tested in this assay and found to possess dPCoAK activity (Fig. 3 A). To test the presence of PPAT activity, immunoprecipitated Myc-CoAsy was incubated in a reaction mixture containing 4′-PP as the substrate. To convert 4′-PP to CoA, both the PPAT and dPCoAK activities are required (Fig. 3 B). The production of radiolabeled CoA in this assay (Fig. 3 A) confirmed that CoAsy does indeed possess both activities. Commercial preparations of cold CoA and 4′-PP were used as standards. Furthermore, PPAT and dPCoAK activities of CoAsy were also confirmed using enzymatic systems and spectrophotometric analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown). The crystal structure of bacterial PPAT in complex with 4′-PP has been determined recently (26Izard T. Geerlof A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2021-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The structure allowed the identification of amino acid residues, which are essential for substrate recognition and catalytic activity. Based on these structural studies and mutational analysis of critical amino acid residues in the catalytic pocket of cytidylyltransferases (27Veitch D.P. Gilham D. Cornell R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we mutated His203 to alanine in the PPAT domain of CoAsy. Transient expression studies in HEK293 cells followed by immunoprecipitation and an in vitro PPAT assay unambiguously demonstrated that the Myc-CoAsy-H203A mutant is not capable of generating CoA when 4′-PP is used as a substrate (Fig.3 A). At the same time, dPCoAK activity of the Myc-CoAsy-H203A mutant remains unaltered. Therefore, based on sequence alignments and biochemical characterization, we can conclude that the Ukr1 cDNA encodes the missing link in CoA biosynthesis, the bifunctional enzyme CoA synthase (Fig. 3 B). Since CoAsy was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as an S6K-binding partner, we are currently investigating the specificity of this interaction in mammalian cells and its functional consequences. Vitamin B5 is a key component in the biosynthesis of CoA. It is readily available from diverse dietary sources, a fact that is underscored by the difficulty encountered in attempting to induce pantothenate deficiency. Vitamin B5 deficiency has not been linked with any particular disease, but results in generalized malaise clinically. It has been demonstrated that tissue CoA levels are not significantly altered in pantothenate deficiency, suggesting that cells are equipped to preserve their pantothenate content, possibly by a recycling mechanism for utilizing pantothenate obtained from the degradation of pantothenate-containing molecules. Biosynthesis of CoA is a universal pathway, conserved from prokaryotes to mammals. Multistep biosynthesis of CoA and the enzymes involved in this process are shown in Fig. 3 B. This study reports the molecular cloning and biochemical characterization of mammalian CoA synthase, previously a gap in the genetics of the mammalian CoA biosynthetic pathway. The presence of PPAT and dPCoAK domains in the predicted amino acid sequence of murine CoAsy strongly suggested its involvement in the biosynthesis of CoA. Expression studies in HEK293 cells provided evidence that recombinant CoAsy possesses both PPAT and dPCoAK activities. These findings were further supported by mutational studies and biochemical analysis of bacterially expressed dPCoAK domain. Interestingly, D. melanogaster and C. elegans have homologues of mammalian CoAsy, while in lower eukaryotes, such as S. cerevisiae and bacteria, the PPAT and dPCoAK activities reside on different proteins. These differences suggest the existence of distinct modes of regulation of CoA biosynthesis. Indeed, the CoA-synthesizing complex in S. cerevisiae was found to have a molecular mass around 400 kDa, while in higher eukaryotes, the existence of such a complex has not been reported (23Bucovaz E.T. Tarnowski S.J. Morrison W.C. Macleod R.M. Morrison J.C. Sobhy C.M. Rhoades J.L. Fryer J.E. Wakim J.M. Whybrew W.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 30: 7-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The compartmentalization of the CoA biosynthetic pathway is poorly understood in mammals. Since mitochondria and peroxisomes contain the greatest concentrations of CoA, it has been proposed that the last enzymes in the pathway are located inside these compartments (28Skrede S. Halvorsen O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Others report that mitochondria can transport CoA into the matrix, implying that all CoA synthesizing enzymes are cytosolic proteins (29Tahiliani A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1067: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Analysis of subcellular localization of CoAsy supports the latter hypothesis, as CoAsy is located predominately in the cytoplasm. 2A. Zhyvoloup, unpublished data. Metabolic labeling experiments have revealed that both pantothenate and 4′-PP accumulate in the cell, suggesting that pantothenate kinase and PPAT catalyze rate-limiting steps in the pathway (30Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 115-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is apparent that the PPAT activity of CoAsy might be regulated in cellular responses to extracellular stimuli or environmental changes. The availability of the molecular reagents that have evolved from this study will allow us to study regulatory mechanisms governing the final stages of CoA biosynthesis.

The sequence of ST8Sia VI encodes a protein of 398 amino acids and shows 42.0 and 38.3% amino acid sequence identities to mouse α2,8-sialyltransferases ST8Sia I (GD3 synthase) and ST8Sia V (GD1c, GT1a, GQ1b, and GT3 synthases), respectively. The recombinant soluble form of ST8Sia VI expressed in COS-7 cells exhibited α2,8-sialyltransferase activity toward both glycolipids and glycoproteins that have the NeuAcα2,3(6)Gal sequence at the nonreducing end of their carbohydrate groups. This enzyme formed NeuAcα2,8NeuAc structures, but not oligosialic or polysialic acid structures. Analysis of the fetuin sialylated by ST8Sia VI indicated that ST8Sia VI prefers O-glycans to N-glycans as acceptor substrates. Substrate specificities and kinetic properties also showed that ST8Sia VI prefers O-glycans to glycolipids as acceptor substrates. ST8Sia VI also exhibited activity toward oligosaccharides such as sialyllactose and sialyllactosamine, and the structure of the minimal acceptor substrate for ST8Sia VI was determined as the NeuAcα2,3(6)Gal sequence. The expression of the ST8Sia VI gene was ubiquitous, and the highest expression was observed in kidney, with three major transcripts of 8.2, 3.8, and 2.7 kb.

The cloned sialyltransferase designations are according to the nomenclature of Tsuji et al. (14Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6 (7): v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) Sialic acids are negatively charged acidic sugars and usually occur at the terminal ends of the carbohydrate groups of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Because of their negative charge and their wide occurrence in exposed positions of cell-surface molecules, sialic acids function as key determinants of oligosaccharide structures that may mediate a variety of biological phenomena such as cell-cell communication, cell-substrate interaction, adhesion, and protein targeting. The sialic acid-containing carbohydrates of glycoproteins and glycolipids also vary according to the tissue and cell type and are subject to change during development and oncogenesis (1Paulson J.C. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). For the synthesis of sialylglycoconjugates, a family of glycosyltransferases called sialyltransferases catalyzes the transfer of a sialic acid from CMP-Sia1 to an acceptor carbohydrate. All mammalian sialyltransferases characterized to date have type II transmembrane topology and contain highly conserved motifs called sialyl motifs L (long), S (short), and VS (very short) (2Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 2-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Geremia R.A.

Sialyl motif L is characterized by a 45–60-amino acid region in the center of the protein, and it has been shown to be involved in the binding of a donor substrate, CMP-Sia (5Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Sialyl motif S is located in the COOH-terminal region and consists of a 20–30-amino acid stretch. It has been shown to be involved in the binding of both the donor and acceptor substrates (6Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Sialyl motif VS is also located in the COOH-terminal region, within which one glutamic acid residue is always found separated by four amino acid residues from a highly conserved histidine residue. This motif is thought to be involved in the catalytic process (4Geremia R.A. Harduin-Lepers A. Delannoy P. Glycobiology. 1997; 7 (2): v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kitazume-Kawaguchi S.

Based on the high sequence conservation of sialyl motifs L and S, PCR-based cloning of sialyltransferase cDNAs has been extensively performed (reviewed in Refs. 8Tsuji S. J. Biochem.

So far, cDNA cloning of 18 members of the mammalian sialyltransferase family has been performed, and they have been grouped into four subfamilies according to the carbohydrate linkages they synthesize: α2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal I–VI), α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal I), GalNAc α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6GalNAc I–VI), and α2,8-sialyltransferase (ST8Sia I–V) (14Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6 (7): v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, five members of the α2,8-sialyltransferase family have been cloned from mouse, and their enzymatic properties have been characterized (15Yamamoto A. Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Fukumoto S.

ST8Sia V is also involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides such as GD1c, GT1a, GQ1b, and GT3. ST8Sia III exhibits activity toward Siaα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc structure on N-glycans of glycoproteins as well as those of glycolipids. ST8Sia II and IV are polysialic acid synthases that catalyze polysialic acid formation on N-glycans of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Although these enzymes exhibit activity toward gangliosides or N-glycans preferentially, they are considered to exhibit no or limited activity towardO-glycans (20Suzuki M. Angata K. Fukuda M.

Here, we describe the cloning of a novel α2,8-sialyltransferase, designated ST8Sia VI, that can sialylateO-glycans as well as glycolipids and sialylated oligosaccharides.

Asialo-BSM, asialo-α1-acid glycoprotein, and asialo-ovomucoid were prepared as described previously (16Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S.

Mouse expressed sequence tags (GenBankTM accession numbers BE633149, BE686184, andBF730564) with similarity to mouse ST8Sia V were identified using the tBLASTn algorithm against the dbEST Database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The expressed sequence tag cDNA clones (accession numbers BE633149 and BF730564) were obtained from the IMAGE Consortium. To isolate cDNA clones, the ST8Sia VI gene-specific primers 5′-CTTTTCTGGAGAACTAAAGG-3′ (nucleotides 1001–1020 in Fig. 1 A) and 5′-AATTGCAGTTTGAGGATTCC-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 1232–1251) were synthesized and used to screen mouse brain and heart cDNA libraries by a PCR-based screening method (24Israel D.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We also amplified part of the ST8Sia VI cDNA fragment by reverse transcription-PCR using primers 5′-TGGCTCAGGATGAGATCGGG-3′ (nucleotides 68–87) and 5′-TACTAGCGCTCCCTGTGATTGG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 725–746) with poly(A)+ RNA prepared from mouse kidney as a template. The above PCRs were performed as follows: 94 °C for 60 s; 30–40 cycles of 94 °C for 60 s, 50 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s; and 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were cloned into the pBluescript II SK(+) vector and sequenced by the dideoxy termination method using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). We constructed an expression vector encoding soluble ST8Sia VI. The DNA fragment encoding a truncated form of ST8Sia VI (lacking the first 25 amino acids of the coding region) was prepared by PCR amplification using a 5′-primer containing a synthetic XhoI site (5′-TGCTCTCGAGCCCAGCCGACGCGCCTGCCC-3′, nucleotides 141–170) and a 3′-primer containing a synthetic XhoI site (5′-TATTCTCGAGCTAAGAAACGTTAAGCCGTT-3′, complementary to nucleotides 1264–1293) with the cloned cDNA fragment as a template. The amplified product was digested with XhoI and subcloned into the XhoI site of the expression vector pcDSA. The resulting plasmid, designated pcDSA-ST8Sia VI, encodes a fusion protein consisting of the IgM signal peptide, theStaphylococcus aureus protein A IgG-binding domain, and the truncated form of ST8Sia VI. We also constructed an expression vector containing the whole coding region of ST8Sia VI. The 1.4-kb NotI-ApaI fragment containing the whole coding region of ST8Sia VI was prepared from the cloned cDNA and subcloned into theNotI-ApaI sites of the expression vector pRc/CMV, yielding pRc/CMV-ST8Sia VI. For production of soluble forms of ST8Sia VI, COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDSA-ST8Sia VI using LipofectAMINETM reagent (Invitrogen) and cultured as described previously (16Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The protein A-fused ST8Sia VI expressed in the medium was adsorbed to IgG-Sepharose gel (Amersham Biosciences) and used as the enzyme source. Sialyltransferase assays were performed as described previously (19Kono M. Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29366-29371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Lee Y.-C. Kaufmann M. Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Kono M. Takashima S. Kurosawa N. Liu H. Pircher H.

In brief, enzymatic activity was measured in 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0), 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton CF-54, 100 μm CMP-[14C]NeuAc, an acceptor substrate, and an enzyme preparation in a total volume of 10 μl. As acceptor substrates, 10 μg of glycoproteins, 5 μg of glycolipids, or 10 μg of mono- or oligosaccharides were used. The enzyme reaction was performed at 37 °C for 3–20 h. For glycoproteins, the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the reaction mixtures were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE. For glycolipids, the reaction mixtures were applied to a Waters Sep-Pak Vac C18 column (100 mg), and purified glycolipids were subjected to HPTLC (Silica Gel 60, Merck). For mono- and oligosaccharides, the reaction mixtures were directly subjected to HPTLC. The radioactive materials were visualized and quantified with a Fuji BAS2000 radioimage analyzer. The intensity of the radioactivity was converted into moles using the radioactivities of various amounts of CMP-[14C]NeuAc (12.0 GBq/mmol, 925 kBq/ml) as standards. Quantification was performed within the linear range of the standard radioactivity. For kinetic analysis, the reaction was performed as described above, except various concentrations of acceptor substrates were used. Under these conditions, the product formation from the individual acceptor substrates was linear up to 4 h. Apparent K m and V max values were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots. For linkage analysis of sialic acids, [14C]NeuAc-incorporated GM3 with ST8Sia VI was purified by C18 column chromatography and dried. The sialylated GM3 was dissolved in 0.1% Triton X-100 and then digested with linkage-specific exosialidase: NANase II (specific for α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acids) or NANase III (specific for α2,3-, α2,6-, α2,8-, and α2,9-linked sialic acids). After the sialidase treatment, desialylated glycolipid was purified by C18column chromatography, dried, and subjected to HPTLC (Silica Gel 60) with a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, and 0.02% CaCl2 (55:45:10). The radioactive materials were visualized with the BAS2000 radioimage analyzer. For preparation of de-N-glycosylated fetuin, [14C]NeuAc-incorporated fetuin was treated with recombinant N-glycanase (glycopeptidase F), which is free of protease activity, according to the manufacturer's instructions. [14C]NeuAc-incorporated fetuin and de-N-glycosylated fetuin were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the radioactive materials were visualized with the BAS2000 radioimage analyzer. COS-7 cells were transfected with pRc/CMV-ST8Sia VI using LipofectAMINETM reagent and Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 5 h of transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 72 h, transfectants and untransfected control cells were collected. Acidic fractions of glycolipid were extracted from 30 mg of packed cells using chloroform/methanol (2:1) and chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8). The combined lipid extracts were applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (acetate form) equilibrated with chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8). After washing the column with methanol, the acidic lipids were eluted with 0.2 m sodium acetate in methanol. After adding 2 volumes of water to the eluate, it was desalted on the C18column, and the gangliosides were obtained. TLC immunostaining was performed according to the method of Saito and Sugiyama (26Saito M. Sugiyama K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1523: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After chromatography of the glycolipids, the TLC plate was coated with polyisobutylmethacrylate solution. The gangliosides on the plate were then reacted consecutively with anti-GD3 monoclonal antibody KM641 (kindly provided by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd.) (27Ohta S. Igarashi S. Honda A. Sato S. Hanai N. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 331-336PubMed Google Scholar) or with anti-GD3 monoclonal antibody S2-566 (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) and peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (H+L) antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The reacted bands were detected on x-ray film using an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). COS-7 cells were transfected with pRc/CMV-ST8Sia VI or pRc/CMV as described above. The cells were then collected and suspended in homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.25m sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA) and sonicated. After centrifugation (3000 × g for 10 min), the supernatant was ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g for 1 h), and the precipitate obtained (microsome fraction) was suspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). Equivalent amounts of proteins (45 μg) with or without N-glycanase treatment were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blotted membrane was incubated with antibody S2-566, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (H+L) antibody, and then visualized with the ECL Western blotting detection kit. For Northern blotting, the mouse multiple-tissue Northern (MTNTM) blot was purchased from CLONTECH. Each lane contains ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA. The blot was probed with the [α-32P]dCTP-labeled ST8Sia VI cDNA (nucleotides 68–1283) or β-actin cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using the mouse expressed sequence tag data base, we found sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers BE633149,BE686184, and BF730564) with similarity to mouse ST8Sia V. These sequences were distinct from those of the previously cloned sialyltransferases, suggesting that these clones encode a novel member of the sialyltransferase family. Thus, we screened a total of ∼1 × 106 clones of mouse brain and heart cDNA libraries and obtained two corresponding clones from each library. But these clones did not contain the entire coding sequence of the novel sialyltransferase, so we also performed reverse transcription-PCR and obtained the entire sequence. The nucleotide sequence of the putative new sialyltransferase cDNA and its deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1 A. The predicted protein consists of 398 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 45,399 Da and with six potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The position of the initiation codon was estimated according to the Kozak consensus sequence (28Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis (29Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) indicated one prominent hydrophobic sequence of 20 amino acids in length in the NH2-terminal region, predicting that the protein has type II transmembrane topology characteristic of many other glycosyltransferases cloned to date (Fig. 1 B). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with those of other mouse sialyltransferases showed significant sequence identity in two regions, sialyl motifs L (31.6–69.0%) and S (30.0–64.0%). In addition, the predicted protein has an (I/L)(F/Y)GFWPF sequence at the COOH-terminal end of sialyl motif S, which is conserved among the members of the ST8Sia family (30Harduin-Lepers A. Vallejo-Ruiz V. Krzewinski-Recchi M.-A. Samyn-Petit B. Julien S. Delannoy P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the predicted protein belongs to the sialyltransferase family, especially the ST8Sia family. The overall amino acid sequence of the predicted protein shows the highest sequence identity to ST8Sia I (42.0%), followed by ST8Sia V (38.3%) (Fig. 2). Thus, we tentatively designated the new sialyltransferase as ST8Sia VI. To facilitate determination of the enzymatic activity of the new sialyltransferase, we constructed the expression plasmid pcDSA-ST8Sia VI, which allows expression of ST8Sia VI lacking the transmembrane domain as a secretable protein fused with the IgG-binding domain ofS. aureus protein A. The plasmid was then transfected into COS-7 cells, and the protein A-fused ST8Sia VI expressed in the medium was adsorbed to IgG-Sepharose resin, which was used as the enzyme source. As ST8Sia VI shows significant similarity to ST8Sia I and V (Fig. 2), which are involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides, we first examined the sialyltransferase activity toward various glycolipids (Table I). As shown in Fig.3 A, [14C]NeuAc was incorporated into 2,3-SPG, GM3, GD1a, GT1b, GM1b, and GM4, commonly containing the NeuAcα2,3Gal sequence at the nonreducing end of their carbohydrate groups. However, ST8Sia VI did not exhibit activity toward lactosylceramide, GD3, GD1b, GM1a, and GQ1b, indicating that the NeuAcα2,3Gal sequence at the nonreducing end is required for its activity.Table IAcceptor substrate specificity of mouse ST8Sia VIAcceptorRepresentative structures of carbohydrateRelative rate %Glycoproteins FetuinNeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr1001-a2.06 pmol/h/ml of enzyme solution.NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3(NeuAcα2,6)GalNAc-O-Ser/ThrNeuAcα2,6(3)Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R Asialofetuin0 α1-Acid glycoproteinNeuAcα2,6(3)Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R0 Asialo-α1-acid glycoprotein0 BSMNeuAcα2,6GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr375GlcNAcβ1,3(NeuAcα2,6)GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr Asialo-BSM0 OvomucoidNeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R6.2 Asialo-ovomucoid0Glycolipids LactosylceramideGalβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer0 GM4NeuAcα2,3Galβ1-Cer1.0 GM3NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer13.0 GM1aGalβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(NeuAcα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer0 GD1aNeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(NeuAcα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer6.0 GD3NeuAcα2,8NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer0 GD1bGalβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(NeuAcα2,8NeuAcα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer0 GT1bNeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(NeuAcα2,8NeuAcα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer1.1 GQ1bNeuAcα2,8NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(NeuAcα2,8NeuAcα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer0 GM1bNeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer1.0 GSC-68NeuAcα2,6Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer2.6 2,3-SPGNeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer3.5 2,6-SPGNeuAcα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer0.98Monosaccharides and oligosaccharides 3′-SialyllactoseNeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glc629 6′-SialyllactoseNeuAcα2,6Galβ1,4Glc91.5 3′-Sialyl-N- acetyllactosamineNeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc411 6′-Sialyl-N- acetyllactosamineNeuAcα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc88.7 3′-SialylgalactoseNeuAcα2,3Gal13.9 6′-SialylgalactoseNeuAcα2,6Gal2.0 N-Acetylneuraminic acidNeuAc0 GalactoseGal0 N-AcetylgalactosamineGalNAc0Various acceptor substrates were incubated in the standard assay mixture using soluble ST8Sia VI fused with protein A as an enzyme source.

Relative rates were calculated as a percentage of the incorporation obtained with fetuin. R represents the remainder of theN-linked oligosaccharide chain. Cer, ceramide. The linkages of the incorporated sialic acids were also examined. The product synthesized from GM3 by the cloned sialyltransferase was treated with linkage-specific exosialidases (Fig.4 A). The incorporated [14C]NeuAc was resistant to treatment with α2,3- and α2,6-specific exosialidase (NANase II; note that the internal α2,3-linked sialic acid initially present in the GM3 structure cannot be released by NANase II), but it was digested by α2,3-, α2,6-, α2,8-, and α2,9-specific exosialidase (NANase III). The sialylated product generated in this experiment was identified as GD3, which contains the disialyl structure of NeuAcα2,8NeuAcα2,3Gal at the nonreducing end, by TLC immunostaining with anti-GD3 monoclonal antibody KM641 (27Ohta S. Igarashi S. Honda A. Sato S. Hanai N. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 331-336PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that the incorporated sialic acids contain α2,8-linkages and that the cloned sialyltransferase certainly belongs to the ST8Sia family. We then examined the sialyltransferase activity toward various glycoproteins. ST8Sia VI exhibited no activity toward asialoglycoproteins, but it exhibited strong activity toward BSM, which contains only O-glycans, and fetuin, which contains bothO-glycans and N-glycans (Fig. 3 B). But ST8Sia VI exhibited weak activity toward ovomucoid and no activity toward α1-acid glycoprotein, both of which containN-glycans, suggesting that ST8Sia VI prefersO-glycans to N-glycans as acceptor substrates. To confirm this, fetuin was 14C-sialylated by ST8Sia VI and treated with N-glycanase (glycopeptidase F), which releasesN-linked oligosaccharides from the glycoprotein. As a comparison, [14C]NeuAc-incorporated fetuin sialylated by ST8Sia III was used. ST8Sia III has been shown to have sialyltransferase activity toward N-glycans (but notO-glycans) of fetuin (17Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When [14C]NeuAc-incorporated fetuin sialylated by ST8Sia III was treated with N-glycanase, the incorporated sialic acids were completely released from the protein, and the corresponding band was not detected (Fig. 5). In contrast, when [14C]NeuAc-incorporated fetuin sialylated by ST8Sia VI was treated with N-glycanase, most of the incorporated sialic acids were not released from the protein, and the shifted bands were detected. This strongly suggests that ST8Sia VI preferentially sialylates O-glycans of fetuin rather thanN-glycans. The amount of [14C]NeuAc incorporated into O-glycan was estimated to be 82.7% of the total amount of [14C]NeuAc originally incorporated into fetuin. Next, we measured the enzymatic parameters of this enzyme for various substrates. The apparent K m andV max values for GM3 were estimated to be 0.5 mm and 0.67 pmol/h/ml, respectively. On the other hand, the apparent K m and V max values for BSM were estimated to be 0.03 mm and 23.8 pmol/h/ml, respectively. The V max /K m values for GM3 and BSM were 1.34 and 793, respectively, indicating that ST8Sia VI prefers O-glycans of glycoproteins to glycolipids as acceptor substrates. ST8Sia VI exhibited activity toward glycolipids containing the NeuAcα2,3Gal sequence at the nonreducing end (Fig. 3 A). We also examined whether this enzyme can utilize NeuAcα2,6Gal sequences at the nonreducing end as acceptor substrates (Fig.6 A). 2,6-SPG and GSC-68 are positional isomers of 2,3-SPG and GM1b, respectively, and each has the NeuAcα2,6Gal sequence at the nonreducing end. ST8Sia VI exhibited activity toward both 2,3-SPG and 2,6-SPG, but it exhibited higher activity toward 2,3-SPG (Table I). On the other hand, ST8Sia VI exhibited activity toward both GM1b and GSC-68; and in this case, it exhibited higher activity toward"

In this paper, we describe a new class of l-arginine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.19) that uses a pyruvoyl group rather than a PLP cofactor to decarboxylate l-arginine to form agmatine.

Cells were harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation (6,000 ×g, 10 min) and were frozen at −30 °C. Recombinant pyruvoyl-dependent arginine decarboxylase (PvlArgDC) protein was purified from soluble cell-free extract by heat treatment and chromatography. E. coli cells (1.1 g, wet weight) expressing PvlArgDC from the pT7-7-derived plasmid were suspended in 6 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6)) and lysed by sonication. Soluble cell-free extract was obtained after centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C. Native E. coli proteins were denatured by heating the soluble extract at 70 °C for 20 min, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25 °C (16,000 × g, 10 min). Heat-soluble cell-free extract (5 ml) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (16 mm × 5.2 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A. Protein was eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1m NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (1.0 ml) containing ArgDC activity (which eluted from 0.1 to 0.4m NaCl) were pooled and sealed in anM r 8000 cut-off membrane (Spectrum). Protein was dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm bis-Tris/HCl (pH 6.5)) for 10 h at 4 °C and then concentrated in the membranes using polyethyleneglycol 8000. Concentrated protein was loaded onto a UNO Q strong anion exchange column (7 × 35 mm; BioRad) equilibrated in buffer B, and protein was eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer B at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Fractions containing activity (which eluted from 0.2 to 0.3 m NaCl) were pooled and concentrated in a Centricon-10 ultrafiltration unit (Millipore Corp.). Concentrated protein was applied to a Sephacryl S-200HR size exclusion column (16 mm × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer C, which contained 150 mm NaCl and 50 mmHepes adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. Chromatography was performed in buffer C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and ArgDC activity eluted maximally at 57 ml. Fractions containing protein were pooled and concentrated in an N2-pressurized stirred cell with a YM10 ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore) and then stored at 4 °C. Protein purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE with diamine or nondiamine (Bio-Rad) silver staining. Protein sizes were analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gels with either a Tris/glycine buffer system (12% T, 2.7% C acrylamide) or a Tris/Tricine buffer system (12% T, 3.3% C acrylamide). Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA total protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Recombinant protein expressed with an amino-terminal polyhistidine tag (PvlArgDCHis) was purified by nickel affinity chromatography (9Graham D.E., Xu, H. White R.H. J. Biol.

To screen compounds as substrates for the M. jannaschii PvlArgDC, amino acids were incubated with enzyme, and the products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Purified PvlArgDC enzyme (1 μg) was incubated with 10 mm amino acid and 50 mm Mes/NaOH (pH 6.0) in a volume of 20 μl at 70 °C for 20 min. Reaction mixtures (2 μl) were spotted onto a silica gel 60 TLC plate (5 × 10 cm; EM Science) and developed in a solvent system containing acetonitrile/water/formic acid (88%) at a volumetric ratio of 80:20:10. Plates were dried, sprayed with ninhydrin reagent (0.2% (w/v) in ethanol), and then heated to visualize amines and amino acids. Amino acids tested as substrates includedl-argininamide, l-arginine,d-arginine,N G-methyl-l-arginine,l-arginine methyl ester, l-aspartate,l-canavanine, dl-α-ε-diaminopimelate,l-citrulline, l-glutamate,l-glutamine, l-histidine, l-lysine, and l-ornithine. Stock solutions of amino acids were dissolved in water and adjusted to neutral pH with HCl or NaOH. To confirm the identities of decarboxylated amino acids, trifluoroacetyl derivatives of reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Reactions (100 μl) containing 8 μg of PvlArgDC, 50 mm NH4OAc, and 10 mm l-arginine,N G-methyl-l-arginine, orl-canavanine were incubated at 80 °C for 30 min. Reactions were evaporated to dryness by heating under a stream of N2 before the addition of ∼100 μl of trifluoroacetic anhydride (50% (v/v)) in methylene chloride. Reactions were heated in sealed vials for 12 h at 50 °C before evaporation to dryness under a stream of N2. Trifluoroacetyl derivatives, dissolved in methylene chloride, were analyzed using a VG-70–70EHF GC-MS operating at 70 eV equipped with an HP-5 column (0.32 mm × 30 m) programmed from 80 to 280 °C at 8 °C/min. One unit of ArgDC activity releases 1 μmol/min CO2 from l-arginine (22Blethen S.L. Boeker E.A. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1671-1677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard activity assays included 50 mm Mes/NaOH (pH 6.0), 50 mmKCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dl-dithiothreitol (DTT), and enzyme in a volume of 100 μl. Buffer salts and enzyme were preincubated at 70 °C for 10 min before the addition of 10 mm l-arginine HCl and 135 nCi of l-[1-14C]arginine (55 mCi/mmol) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). After a 5–10-min incubation at 70 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 4 m HCl, and 14CO2 was collected on 8-mm diameter circles of Whatman No. 1 filter paper soaked with 10 μl of a saturated Ba(OH)2 solution (23Tabor H. Tabor C.W. Hafner E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 485-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and placed in the top of a 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tube. Acidified reactions were incubated at 70 °C for 15 min before filters were removed to vials for liquid scintillation counting in 1 ml of ScintiVerse BD fluid (Fisher). ArgDC activity of the purified enzyme was optimized by varying reaction conditions including temperature, pH, and potential cofactors. All reactions were carried out in enzymatic activity-limited conditions. Effects of reaction temperature were studied in standard assays initiated by the addition of enzyme to reaction mixtures pre-equilibrated in water or sand baths. Reactions were incubated at temperatures from 23 to 90 °C for 10–12 min and then terminated with HCl. To further test its thermostability, 10 μg of PvlArgDC (in 20 μl of 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.1)) was sealed in a melting point capillary tube and then incubated at 125 °C for 30 min. The influence of pH on ArgDC activity was studied using approximately constant ionic strength acetic acid-Mes-Tris buffers (24Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Effects of KCl (Fisher), NaCl (Fisher), NH4Cl (Fisher), NaHCO3 (J. T. Baker), MgCl2·6H2O (Fisher), DTT, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and thiamine pyrophosphate were also tested in standard assays. Initial rates of PvlArgDC-catalyzed decarboxylase activity were measured at various concentrations of l-arginine to infer kinetic parameters. All reactions were preincubated at the reaction temperature before the addition of l-arginine. Assays (100 μl) contained 2 μg of PvlArgDC, pH buffer, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25–15 mm l-arginine, and 50–150 nCi ofl-[1-14C]arginine (55 mCi/mmol). The pH buffers used were 50 mm trisodium citrate/HCl (pH 4.8), 50 mm Mes/NaOH (pH 6.0) or 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.2). Initial rate data were fitted to the hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten-Henri equation, and kinetic parameters were calculated using the Levenberg-Marquardt method of nonlinear least squares regression using equal weighting (SigmaPlot 2000; SPSS Science). Potential inhibitors of ArgDC activity were preincubated in reactions (100 μl) containing 39 μg/ml PvlArgDC. Fixed time point reactions were initiated with 5 mm l-arginine and 100 nCil-[1-14C]arginine (55 mCi/mmol), incubated at 70 °C, and terminated after 7 min as described for standard assays. Compounds tested as inhibitors included agmatine,l-argininamide, l-arginine methyl ester, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, cadaverine, l-citrulline,l-histidine, l-lysine, d-arginine,l-ornithine, l-glutamine,l-aspartate, guanidine, methylguanidine HCl, and urea. Compounds expected to react with free pyruvoyl groups were similarly tested as inhibitors: phenylhydrazine HCl, methoxyamine HCl,o-phenylenediamine, andO-(4-nitrobenzyl)hydroxylamine HCl (ONBH).o-Phenylenediamine dissolved in methylene chloride was decolorized with Norit A-activated charcoal (J. T. Baker) and crystallized before use. Protein subunit structure was analyzed using a Superose 12HR column (1 × 30 cm;Amersham Biosciences). The column was operated and calibrated as described previously (9Graham D.E., Xu, H. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13421-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Eluted protein was detected by its absorbance at 280 nm and ArgDC activity. A saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix was prepared in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Purified ArgDC (0.5 μl of a 3.9 mg/ml solution) was mixed with 0.5 μl of the matrix solution on a stainless steel target (Shimadzu). Dried, crystalline samples were washed with 5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and dried under a stream of N2. Samples were analyzed in a Kratos KOMPACT SEQ MALDI-TOF instrument (Shimadzu) operated in the linear mode at 20 kV. For each sample, 50 spectra were collected by scanning across the sample, and average masses were identified using the combined sample set. Ions of sodium, matrix, neurotensin, gramicidin D, bovine pancreas insulin chain B (oxidized), and horse heart cytochrome c were used for mass calibration. t-Butoxycarbonyl-l-isoleucine was coupled with α-amino-γ-butyrolactone·HBr in the presence of triethylamine andN-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline in a dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran solvent mixture to form theN-t-butoxycarbonyl-l-isoleucine-homoserine lactone peptide (25Belleau B. Malek G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 1651-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The resulting dipeptide was deprotected with 3m HCl in ethyl acetate (26Stahl G.L. Walker R. Smith C.W. J. Org. Chem. 1978; 43: 2285-2286Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and then coupled, usingN-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline, with the ONBH oxime derivative of pyruvic acid. The oxime was formed by the condensation of ONBH hydrochloride with pyruvic acid in pyridine. The resulting peptide was purified by preparative TLC using ethyl acetate as the solvent. The peptide derivative had λmax at 268 nm and had a partition coefficient between ethyl acetate and water of 26.1H NMR and COSY analysis of the peptide was consistent with the assigned structure and confirmed that the peptide consisted of four isomers resulting from the presence of the racemic homoserine lactone and the cis- and trans-oximes. Mass spectral analysis by electron impact (70 eV) gave a M+ of 434m/z. The peptide was also analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) on a LCQDecaXP instrument (Thermo- Finnigan). Analysis of a sample dissolved in water and separated on a C18 column (Phenomenex) showed a peak with a MH+ ion at 453.1m/z, indicating that the lactone had undergone ring opening. Tandem mass spectrometry identified a b2-type ion (333.8 m/z) and an a2-type ion (305.9 m/z), both derived from the 453.1m/z molecular ion. To a sample containing 300 μg of PvlArgDC in 100 μl of 40 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.2) was added 0.5 μmol of ONBH (Fig. 1). The reaction was incubated at 75 °C for 30 min. The sample was cooled to room temperature before the addition of 25 μmol of NH4HCO3 and 93 μmol of 2-mercaptoethanol. Protein was incubated under an atmosphere of N2 for 12 h before the sample was evaporated to dryness under a stream of N2. Protein was resuspended in 200 μl 70% (w/v) formic acid with a small amount of cyanogen bromide (27Smith B.J. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 369-373Crossref Google Scholar). After a 12-h incubation at room temperature, the sample was evaporated to dryness under a stream of N2, suspended in 200 μl of water, and extracted with 150 μl of ethyl acetate. The organic phase, containing the ONBH-Pvl-Ile-Hse peptide (Fig.1), was evaporated to dryness under a stream of N2, and the residue was resuspended in water for LC-ESI-MS analysis as described above. The translated sequence of the M. jannaschii gene MJ0316 (Swiss-Prot accession number Q57764) was used in iterative queries of the nonredundant protein data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLASTP program (version 2.2.1) (28Altschul S.F.

Homologs (and their GenBank™/EBI accession numbers) were identified in the archaea Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AAB88952.1 and AAB91232.1), Halobacterium sp.

Additional homologs were identified in incomplete genomic sequences from Ferroplasma acidarmanusand Methanosarcina barkeri (Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute; available on the World Wide Web at www.jgi.doe.gov),Porphyromonas gingivalis (Sanger Institute Sequencing Group; available on the World Wide Web at www.sanger.ac.uk),Methanococcus maripaludis (University of Washington; available on the World Wide Web at www.genome.washington.edu/Methanococcus.html), and Chlorobium tepidum and Carboxyldothermus hydrogenoformans (The Institute for Genomic Research; available on the World Wide Web at www.tigr.org). Amino acid sequences were aligned automatically using the ClustalW program (version 1.82) (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). From the alignment of 17 protein sequences, 165 positions were deemed to be confidently aligned. These were analyzed by protein maximum likelihood methods using the ProML program (30Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package), version 3.6a2.1. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle2001Google Scholar) with the JTT amino acid substitution model. Bootstrap proportions were calculated using Seqboot, ProML, and Consense programs (30Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package), version 3.6a2.1. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle2001Google Scholar) to create and evaluate 500 resampled alignments. An alternative tree was inferred using the Protdist and Neighbor programs (30Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package), version 3.6a2.1. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle2001Google Scholar) to analyze the same alignment. The complete genome sequence of M. jannaschiiencodes a single member of the PLP-dependent family of enzymes that decarboxylate amino acids at the C-α position, which includes the canonical arginine decarboxylase enzyme (15Bult C.J.

The protein encoded by this locus (MJ1097) is most similar to bacterial diaminopimelate decarboxylases. We have demonstrated that the recombinantly expressed MJ1097 enzyme decarboxylatesdl-α-ε-diaminopimelate (to producel-lysine) but does not decarboxylate l-arginine or l-ornithine. 2D. E. Graham, H.

This group of genes that are required for polyamine biosynthesis suggested that the MJ0316-encoded protein could be an arginine decarboxylase. This protein sequence has no significant similarity to characterized proteins in sequence databases; nor do homologs of MJ0316 share any conserved lysine residue required to bind a PLP. However, members of this family of uncharacterized proteins have conserved serine-serine residues similar to the pyruvoyl group-forming cleavage site of some histidine decarboxylase enzymes (32Riley W.D. Snell E.E. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3520-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Riley W.D. Snell E.E. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1485-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). E. coli cells that expressed the M. jannaschiiMJ0316 gene from a strong promoter produce large amounts of recombinant protein, comprising ∼10% of the cells' total soluble protein. Protein purification by heating (to denature most native E. coli proteins), anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography removed most contaminating proteins and nucleic acids. TableI shows the purification of 8 mg of MJ0316 protein from 1.1 g (wet mass) recombinant E. coli. The enzyme is soluble at concentrations of at least 4 mg/ml, and it retained 80% activity when stored for 8 months at 4 °C in 50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5).

Parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa, includingPlasmodium, Toxoplasma,Cryptosporidium, and Eimeria, cause serious diseases in humans as well as in animals. Identifying candidate drugs either for a stand-alone or combination therapy requires characterization of key metabolic pathways in apicomplexan parasites, including their enzymology and subcellular localization. The basic molecular and cellular mechanisms are likely to be similar in all Apicomplexa. However, a significant divergence of these species with respect to protein structure, physiology, and host range point to potential variability in the effectiveness and specificity of inhibitors targeting any particular enzyme. The metabolic pathways located in the apicoplast, a plastid-like organelle found in Apicomplexa (1Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G.K. Kissinger J.C. Klimczak L.J. Striepen B. Curr. Opin.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), supports the hypothesis that the apicoplast is a site of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. ACC catalyzes carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA (full reaction). The enzyme consists of three major functional domains: the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain, the carboxyltransferase (CT) domain, and the biotin carboxyl carrier (BCC) domain containing covalently attached biotin. The first step of the ACC-catalyzed reaction is an ATP-dependent transfer of the carboxyl group from bicarbonate to the biotin residue (first half-reaction). The carboxyl group is then transferred to acetyl-CoA producing malonyl-CoA (second half-reaction). Malonyl-CoA is used for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis as well as in fatty acid elongation. Our previous study of ACC and its genes in T. gondii (6Jelenska J. Crawford M.J. Harb O.S. Zuther E. Haselkorn R., D.S. Roos D.S. Gornicki P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ACC1 and ACC2 are both of the multidomain type (all functional domains in one polypeptide) found in the cytosol of eukaryotes and in plastids of some plants. Genes encoding multidomain ACC have been found in other Apicomplexa as well (9Zuther E. Johnson J.J. Haselkorn R. McLeod R. Gornicki P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this paper we show that the T. gondii apicoplast ACC is sensitive to fops and that its CT activity is targeted by these inhibitors. We also describe in vitro and in vivosystems to screen for new ACC inhibitors. Various constructs were assembled from cloned cDNA fragments (6Jelenska J. Crawford M.J. Harb O.S. Zuther E.

DNA fragments with engineered restriction sites were obtained using the Expand High-Fidelity PCR system (Roche) to limit the number of PCR-related errors, cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and sequenced before further use. Convenient restriction sites in the multiple cloning sites (MCS) of the cloning vectors were used in some constructions. The pPROEX HT-based system (Invitrogen) was used to express His-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. The pRS423-based system using the GAL10 promoter and yeast ACC1leader and 3′-UTR (14Nikolskaya T.

ACC cDNA fragments ACC1/fragment II, ACC1/fragment III, ACC1/fragment IV, and ACC2/fragment III were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) as previously described (6Jelenska J. Crawford M.J. Harb O.S. Zuther E. Haselkorn R., D.S. Roos D.S. Gornicki P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2723-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments ACC1/fragment V and ACC2/fragment IV were isolated from aT. gondii cDNA library in pBluescriptSK (+) vector (Stratagene) as previously described (6Jelenska J. Crawford M.J. Harb O.S. Zuther E. Haselkorn R., D.S. Roos D.S. Gornicki P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2723-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ACC1/fragment II and ACC1/fragment III were joined in pGEM-T Easy vector by three-piece ligation to create ACC1/fragment II+III;SnaBI-SgrAI fragment of ACC1/fragment II andSgrAI-NdeI (MCS) fragment of ACC1/fragment III were inserted between SnaBI and NdeI (MCS) sites of the plasmid containing ACC1/fragment II. ACC1/fragment IV and ACC1/fragment V were joined in the same manner to create ACC1/fragment IV+V; NotI (MCS)-BssSI fragment of ACC1/fragment IV and BssSI-BamHI fragment of ACC1/fragment V were inserted between NotI (MCS) and BamHI sites of the plasmid containing ACC1/fragment V. ACC2/fragment III and ACC2/fragment IV were joined by insertingXmaI-StuI fragment of ACC2/fragment III with an engineered XmaI site at the 5′ end between XmaI (MCS) and StuI sites of the plasmid containing ACC2/fragment IV to create ACC2/fragment III+IV. Construct ACC/fl comprising full-length mature ACC1 was obtained by inserting a NotI (MCS)-RsrII fragment of ACC1/fragment II+III and anRsrII-AvrII fragment of fragment ACC1/fragment IV+V into expression vector pPROEX HTa between NotI andXbaI sites. Construct ACC1/bct encoding approximately two thirds of the C-terminal part of ACC1 was created by inserting aSnaBI-RsrII fragment of ACC1/fragment II+III andRsrII-AvrII fragment of ACC1/fragment IV+V into vector pPROEX HTb between StuI and XbaI sites. Construct ACC1/ct encoding the CT domain of ACC1 was obtained by inserting NotI (MCS)-AvrII fragment of ACC1/fragment IV+V into pPROEX HTb vector between NotI andXbaI sites. Shorter construct ACC1/ct1 was created by inserting SacI-BamHI andBamHI-AvrII fragments of ACC1/fragment V into pPROEX HTc between SacI and XbaI sites. Construct ACC1/ct2 was obtained by inserting SmaI-HindIII fragment of construct ACC1/ch3 (described below) into pPROEX HTc between StuI and HindIII sites. Construct ACC1/ct3 was obtained by inserting NcoI-BamHI andBamHI-AvrII fragments of ACC1/fragment V into pPROEX HTa between NcoI and XbaI sites. ACC2/fragment III+IV was cut from the vector with SmaI andKpnI (MCS) and inserted into pPROEX HTc betweenStuI and KpnI sites to create construct ACC2/ct1. A construct shorter at the 5′ end, ACC2/ct2, contained aSspI-KpnI (MCS) fragment of ACC2/fragment III+IV inserted into pPROEX HTc between the StuI-KpnI sites. Construct ACC2/ct3 was created by insertingStuI-KpnI (MCS) fragment of ACC2/fragment IV into pPROEX HTb cut with appropriate enzymes. Construct ACC2/ct4 was shorter at the 3′ end and contained StuI-XhoI fragment of ACC2/fragment IV cloned into pPROEX HTb. The yeastACC1 3′-UTR with Eco47III and ApaI sites engineered by PCR, using construct C100 (14Nikolskaya T. Zagnitko O. Tevzadze G. Haselkorn R. Gornicki P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Constructs ACC1/ch1, ACC1/ch2, ACC1/ch3, and ACC1/ch4 were created by inserting DNA fragments from construct C100 (14Nikolskaya T. Zagnitko O. Tevzadze G. Haselkorn R. Gornicki P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14647-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) encoding wheat cytosolic ACC and DNA fragments encoding T. gondii ACC1 from the intermediate ACC1/fragment Vyt between SacII and ApaI sites of yeast vector pRS423. Construct ACC1/ch1 included fragmentsSacII-AvrII andAvrII-BssHII from C100, andBssHII (engineered by PCR)-SgrAI andSgrAI-ApaI from ACC1/fragment Vyt. Construct ACC1/ch2 included fragments SacII-AvrII andAvrII-SphI from C100, andSphI (engineered by PCR)-SgrAI andSgrAI-ApaI from ACC1/fragment Vyt. Construct ACC1/ch3 included fragments SacII-AvrII andAvrII-XmaI (engineered by PCR) from C100, and XmaI (engineered by PCR)-AatII and AatII-ApaI from ACC1/fragment Vyt. Construct ACC1/ch4 was created from ACC1/ch2 by replacing a PmlI-AatII fragment withPmlI-XmaI (engineered by PCR) fragment from C100 and XmaI (engineered by PCR)-AatII from ACC1/fragment V. To create constructs ACC1/fl1, ACC1/fl2, and ACC1/fl3, an NcoI site and a translation start codon were engineered by PCR at three different locations. NcoI-BsrGI fragment from each of the three PCR-generated DNA fragments, BsrGI fragment of ACC1/fl (described above), and BsrGI-ApaI fragment of the intermediate construct ACC1/fragment Vyt were inserted betweenNcoI and ApaI sites of construct C100(14Nikolskaya T.

A. 1999; 96: 14647-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to replace the wheat cytosolic ACC ORF encoded by C100with the apicoplast ACC1 ORF. ACC2/ch2 was created by inserting fragment XbaI-XmaI (both sites engineered) of C100 and XmaI-Eco47III (both engineered) of ACC2/fragment IV between XbaI andEco47III sites of ACC1/fragment Vyt to first create an intermediate construct wheat-ACC2/fragment IVyt and then inserting aPmlI-ApaI fragment from this intermediate betweenPmlI and ApaI sites of C100 to replace the 3′-terminal fragment of the wheat cytosolic ACC ORF encoded by C100 with a corresponding fragment of theToxoplasma ACC2 ORF. Construct ACC2/ch1 was created by replacing a XmaI-ApaI fragment in ACC1/ch3 with aXmaI-XhoI fragment of ACC2/fragment III+IV andXhoI-ApaI fragment of the intermediate construct wheat-ACC2/fragment IVyt. pPROEX HT plasmids carrying various constructs were introduced into E. coli strain DH5α. Liquid cultures started from fresh transformants grown to an optical density (OD) of ∼0.8 measured at 600 nm were induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were harvested after 4–16 h of culture at room temperature. Protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 4–15% gels from Bio-Rad according to the manufacturer's protocol and staining with Coomassie Blue. His-tagged proteins were affinity-purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Poly(histidine)-tagged protein protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added before cell lysis. The ACC activity was assayed by measuring incorporation of 14C from bicarbonate to acid-stable malonyl-CoA (at 37 °C), and the reverse CT reaction (at 23 and 37 °C) was assayed by measuring transfer of the carboxyl group from [14C]malonyl-CoA to biotin ester as described previously (15Zagnitko O. Jelenska J. Tevzadze G. Haselkorn R. Gornicki P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6617-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The conditions of the reverse CT reaction were such that 10–80% of the substrate was converted within 30–90 min. Inhibitors were added as 20-fold concentrated solutions in 10% Me2SO in 0.1m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Imidazole from the affinity column buffer had no effect on either enzymatic activity or on the inhibition patterns. Protein biotinylation was analyzed on Western blots using35S-streptavidin as described previously (16Gornicki P. Haselkorn R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These experiments were carried out as described before (14Nikolskaya T. Zagnitko O. Tevzadze G. Haselkorn R. Gornicki P. Proc.

D. Kohlwein (Technical University Graz, Graz, Austria). Constructs encoding Toxoplasma ACC and wheat/Toxoplasmachimeric ACCs were introduced on replicating plasmids and complementation of the ACC1 null mutation was tested by tetrad analysis. Inhibition by fops and dims was measured in vivo by growing appropriate gene-replacement haploid yeast strains in YPR medium (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 0.1% adenine sulfate, 2% raffinose) supplemented with 0.001–2% galactose, in the absence and in the presence of inhibitors added as 100-fold concentrated stock solutions in Me2SO. Growth of the yeast strains was determined by measuring culture turbidity at 600 nm. 1 OD corresponds to ∼1.3 × 107 cells/ml (14Nikolskaya T. Zagnitko O. Tevzadze G. Haselkorn R. Gornicki P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14647-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fungal/yeast protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added before cell lysis for protein isolation. Total yeast protein for SDS-PAGE was extracted by the trichloroacetic acid method. Haloxyfop and sethoxydim were purchased from Crescent Chemicals (Hauppauge, NY). Clodinafop and cethoxydim (our name for CGA215684) were provided by Novartis (now Syngenta, Research Triangle Park, NC). cDNA encoding full-length mature (i.e. without the signal/transit peptide) T. gondii plastid ACC1 was assembled from overlapping cDNA fragments cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR or isolated from a cDNA library (6Jelenska J. Crawford M.J. Harb O.S. Zuther E. Haselkorn R., D.S. Roos D.S. Gornicki P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2723-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These cDNAs were used to prepare a series of constructs for expression in E. coli of full-length T. gondii ACC1 as well as its fragments containing the CT domain (Fig. 1 and TableI). All of these peptides were fused to a His tag at their N termini to permit purification by affinity chromatography. Construct ACC1/fl encoded all three functional domains of the apicoplast enzyme (ACC1). Mature apicoplast ACC is formed by removal of a signal peptide during transport into the organelle. This signal/transit peptide is located within a 300-amino acid extension located immediately upstream of the conserved BC domain (6Jelenska J. Crawford M.J. Harb O.S. Zuther E. Haselkorn R., D.S. Roos D.S. Gornicki P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2723-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the exact location of the processing site is not known. The signal peptide was excluded from ACC1/fl by engineering a fusion with the His tag at an arbitrary site 30 codons upstream of the first conserved residue of the BC domain (6Jelenska J. Crawford M.J. Harb O.S. Zuther E. Haselkorn R., D.S. Roos D.S. Gornicki P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2723-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Construct ACC1/bct included two domains: BCC and CT. Construct ACC1/ct encoded only the second half of the enzyme, and constructs ACC1/ct1–ACC1/ct3 encoded different length C-terminal fragments of ACC1, all including the conserved CT domain.

We describe here a new Ca2+-regulatory pathway involving the inhibition by angiotensin II of calcium extrusion through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Caffeine reduced both the angiotensin II-induced calcium signal and aldosterone production in bovine glomerulosa cells. These effects were independent of cAMP or calcium release from intracellular stores. The calcium response to angiotensin II was more sensitive to caffeine than the response to potassium, suggesting that the drug interacts with a pathway specifically elicited by the hormone. In calcium-free medium, calcium returned more rapidly to basal levels after angiotensin II stimulation in the presence of caffeine. Thapsigargin had no effect on these kinetics, but diltiazem, which inhibits the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, markedly reduced the rate of calcium decrease and abolished caffeine action. The involvement of this exchanger was supported by the effect of cell depolarization and of a reduction of extracellular sodium on the rate of calcium extrusion. We also determined the mechanism of angiotensin II action on the exchanger. Phorbol esters reduced the rate of calcium extrusion, which was increased by baicalein, an inhibitor of lipoxygenases, and by SB 203580, an inhibitor of the p38 MAPK. Finally, we showed that angiotensin II acutely activates, in a caffeine-sensitive manner, p38 MAPK in glomerulosa cells. In conclusion, in bovine glomerulosa cells, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger plays a crucial role in extruding calcium, and, by reducing its activity, angiotensin II influences the amplitude of the calcium signal. The hormone exerts its action on the exchanger through a caffeine-sensitive pathway involving the p38 MAPK and lipoxygenase products.

Bollag W.B. Isales C.M. McCarthy R.T. Rasmussen H. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 496-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Spät A. Enyedi P. Hajnoczky G. Hunyady L. Exp.

Whereas K+ principally activates voltage-operated calcium channels of both L and T type through direct membrane depolarization (4Barrett P.Q. Isales C.M. Bollag W.B. McCarthy R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F706-F719PubMed Google Scholar), the Ca2+ response to AngII appears biphasic; a first acute elevation of [Ca2+] c due to Ca2+release from intracellular stores is followed by a sustained response reflecting the activation of Ca2+ influx through channels of the plasma membrane. This second phase is maintained by the activity of both voltage-gated and store-operated Ca2+ channels. Beside these basic pathways of Ca2+ mobilization, additional mechanisms have been proposed to participate or to modulate the Ca2+ signal elicited by AngII in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells. For example, the participation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) in Ca2+transport (in one direction or the other) during cell exposure to AngII has been suggested (2Spät A. Enyedi P. Hajnoczky G. Hunyady L. Exp. Physiol. 1991; 76: 859-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5Van der Bent V. Demole C. Johnson E.I.M. Rossier M.F. Python C.P. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, the protein kinase C (PKC) wing of AngII signaling probably also regulates, directly or indirectly, the Ca2+ messenger system. Although it was proposed earlier that activation of this enzyme is essential for the steroidogenic response to Ca2+-mobilizing hormones (6Kojima I. Kojima K. Kreutter D. Rasmussen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14448-14457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the same authors reported an inhibition of the phospholipase C by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (7Kojima I.

In addition to the phospholipase C-mediated formation of diacylglycerol, AngII also stimulates the production of arachidonic acid by activation of a phospholipase A2 (9Kojima I. Kojima K. Rasmussen H. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or from diacylglycerol through a diacylglycerol lipase (10Natarajan R. Stern N. Nadler J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, there is scant information concerning the exact relationship between PKC, phospholipase A2, and diacylglycerol lipase in steroidogenic cells. Nevertheless, arachidonic acid serves as a substrate for various enzymes that will further convert it into leukotrienes, prostaglandins, or hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). The latter, and more specifically the 12-lipoxygenase products, have been proposed for many years to play an important role in aldosterone synthesis (11Natarajan R. Stern N. Hsueh W., Do, Y. Nadler J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Natarajan R. Dunn W.D. Stern N. Nadler J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 72: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 12-HETE appears to be directly involved in the generation of the AngII-elicited Ca2+ signal, because this response is prevented by lipoxygenase blockers such as baicalein and restored by the addition of 12-HETE (13Stern N. Yanagawa N. Saito F. Hori M. Natarajan R. Nadler J. Tuck M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of ubiquitous and highly conserved serine-threonine protein kinases activated by diverse stimuli ranging from cytokines, growth factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, cellular stress, and cell adherence (14Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Mammalian MAPKs have been classified in three groups, which differ in their activation pathway and include the MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase (also referred as p42/44 MAPK), the MAPK c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and the MAPK p38. Angiotensin II, through its AT1 receptor, has been shown to activate p42/44 MAPK in bovine adrenal fasciculata cells (15Chabre O. Cornillon F. Bottari S.P. Chambaz E.M. Vilgrain I. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 956-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as well as in bovine and rat glomerulosa cells (16Tian Y. Smith R.D. Balla T. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17McNeill H. Puddefoot J.R. Vinson G.P. Endocr. Res. 1998; 24: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), an effect probably linked to the action of this hormone on cell proliferation (18Natarajan R. Gonzales N. Hornsby P.J. Nadler J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This activation, easily detected by measuring the phosphorylated forms of the enzymes, is maximal after a few minutes and appears mediated by various effectors including PKC and the Ras/Raf-1 kinase pathway (19Smith R.D. Baukal A.J. Dent P. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation of the p38 MAPK by AngII in glomerulosa cells is poorly documented, despite the fact that the hormone has been shown to induce an increase in p38 activity in vascular smooth muscle cells, particularly under high glucose conditions (20Natarajan R. Scott S. Bai W. Yerneni K.K. Nadler J. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 378-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that AngII leads to a dose-dependent increase in p38 MAPK activity in H295R adrenocortical cells, an effect mimicked by the addition of 12-HETE (21Yang D.C. Nadler J. Lanting L. Natarajan R. 81st Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society Abstracts. Endocrine Society Press, Bethesda, MD1999: 361Google Scholar). In contrast, no action of the hormone was observed on the activity of the stress-activated MAPK c-Jun N-terminal kinase. The authors also indicate that AngII-induced aldosterone stimulation was significantly attenuated by a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor but not by an inhibitor of the MEK/ERK pathway. In the present study, we have analyzed the mechanisms by which caffeine, a drug known to interfere with multiple targets involved in cell signaling, exerts its action on the intracellular Ca2+response elicited by AngII in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells. After excluding multiple cellular mechanisms, we found that Ca2+extrusion out of the cytosol through the plasma membrane NCX is negatively modulated by p38 MAPK and demonstrate that caffeine, a potent inhibitor of this regulatory pathway, maintains a high rate of calcium extrusion during hormonal stimulation.

(Meriden, CT). Bovine adrenals were obtained from a local slaughterhouse, and glomerulosa cells were prepared by enzymatic dispersion with dispase and purified on a Percoll density gradient, as previously described in detail (22Rossier M.F. Python C.P. Capponi A.M. Schlegel W. Kwan C.Y. Vallotton M.B Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For primary culture, cells were transferred to antibiotic-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with insulin/transferrin/selenium (2 μg/ml insulin, 2 μg/ml transferrin, 2 ng/ml sodium selenite), 5 μm metyrapone, 2 mm glutamine, 6 units/ml nystatin, 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and 10% (v/v) horse serum. The cells were plated on 6- or 24-well culture plates (2 or 0.7 × 106 cells/well) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The next day, the medium was removed and replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cytosolic calcium concentrations [Ca2+] c were determined with fluorescent probes in freshly prepared cell populations as previously described (8Rossier M.F. Aptel H.B.C. Python C.P. Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15137-15142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For this purpose, freshly purified cells were washed three times with 50 ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer and maintained in this medium for at least 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were then centrifuged, diluted at a concentration of 4 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated in the presence of 2 μm fura-2/AM, 5 μmfluo-3/AM, or 5 μm fluo-4/AM. The dye excess was then washed away, and cells were maintained in the same medium. Immediately before use, aliquots of 2 × 106 cells were washed and diluted in appropriate experimental medium. The fluorescent signals (excitation at 340/380 nm and emission at 505 nm for fura-2, and excitation at 488 nm and emission at 540 nm for fluo-3 and fluo-4) were recorded with a Jasco (Hachioji City, Japan) CAF-110 fluorescence spectrometer. Calcium concentrations were calculated as described elsewhere (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using a K d value of 224 nm for fura-2 and 325 nm for fluo-3 and fluo-4. Calcium traces, recorded in Ca2+-free, EGTA (0.2 mm)-supplemented Krebs-Ringer medium, were digitized at a frequency of 2 Hz and analyzed with a mathematical analysis program (Origin version 4.1). The decreasing phase of the response to AngII (Fig. 4) during the extrusion of calcium out of the cytosol was fitted over a 2-min period to a decreasing exponential function of the first order: y(t) = y 0 +A × exp[−(t −t 0)/t 12], wherey(t) is the value of [Ca2+] c as a function of time,y 0 is the final calcium level reached after calcium extrusion from the cytosol, A is the amplitude of the calcium release peak, t 0 is the beginning of the analysis interval (15 s after the calcium release peak), andt 12 is the time constant corresponding to the half-life of calcium in the cytosol or more precisely the time taken by the cells to reach a cytosolic calcium level corresponding to 36.9% (1/e) of the initial concentration (att 0). This latter parameter (t 12), determined after optimizing the fitting curve, reflects the rate of calcium extrusion out of the cytosol and was used to assess the action of various agents on calcium homeostasis. For measuring Ins(1,4,5)P3- and caffeine-induced calcium release from the organelles, glomerulosa cells were first permeabilized, as previously described (24Rossier M.F. Krause K.-H. Lew P.D. Capponi A.M. Vallotton M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4053-4058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly prepared cells were washed twice with M199 (2.66 g/liter modified Hanks' medium, 15 mm NaHCO3, 3.5 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl) and once with Krebs-Ringer buffer. They were then incubated for 10 min in a Ca2+-free Krebs-Ringer solution supplemented with 50 μm EGTA. After incubation, cells were washed twice in 50 ml of permeabilization buffer (250 mm sucrose and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2). Cells were then permeabilized in a minimal volume by repeated (8–12 times) brief (100 μs) exposure to an intense electric field (1400 V/cm). Under these conditions, ∼90% of treated cells were stained with trypan blue. Before use, cells were washed and placed in an intracellular-like buffer (5 mm NaCl, 115 mm KCl, 5 mmNaHCO3, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) at 37 °C under constant agitation. Cell autofluorescence was determined before adding free acid fura-2 (2 μm), Mg-ATP (2 mm), phosphocreatine disodium salt (10 mm), creatine phosphokinase (8 IU/ml), succinate (5 mm), pyruvate (5 mm), rotenone (0.1 μm), and oligomycin (1 μm) to initiate calcium incorporation into the organelles. After reaching a low steady state calcium level, tested agents were added directly into the ambient medium, and calcium fluctuations were followed by recording fura-2 fluorescent signal, as in intact cells. Calcium responses were calibrated by the addition of known amounts of CaCl2 into the medium after inhibition of calcium incorporation into the organelles with thapsigargin and ionomycin. In experiments assessing 45Ca2+ incorporation into the organelles, permeabilized cells were maintained at 4 °C until adding the reaction buffer (100 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing 1 μCi/ml45Ca2+, an ATP-regenerating system (3 mm MgATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine disodium salt, 8 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase), mitochondrial inhibitors (10 μm antimycin, 1 μg/ml oligomycin), 5 mmoxalate, and drugs to be tested. The free Ca2+concentration in the medium was fixed at ∼1 μm with 4.5 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm BAPTA. Cells (samples of 2–3 × 106) were immediately incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and calcium uptake was stopped by the addition of 2 mm LaCl3 at 0 °C. Cells were then poured on Whatmann GF/B filters, and calcium excess was washed with 2 × 4 ml of washing buffer (250 mm sucrose, 40 mm NaCl, at 4 °C). Radioactivity retained on the filters was measured in a Packard 1900 TR β counter after adding 10 ml of UltimaGold. Aldosterone production was determined in the medium of cells in primary culture. Two days after replacing culture medium by serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, plated cells were washed three times with Krebs-Ringer buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the same solution containing different experimental drugs. After this first incubation, the medium was discarded and replaced by a fresh one of the same composition, and the cells were incubated for an additional 60-min period. At the end, the media were collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 ×g. The supernatants were frozen until aldosterone determination by direct radioimmunoassay, using a commercially available kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX). Aldosterone production was expressed per mg of cell protein, itself measured in each dish with the Coomassie Blue method (Bio-Rad). The relative activity of the p38 MAPK was assessed by measuring the enzyme-phosphorylated form by immunoblotting. For this purpose, primary cultured cells were used 24–60 h after having been deprived of serum. After a 30-min preincubation at 37 °C with various agents tested, cells were stimulated for the indicated periods of time with AngII (100 nm). At the end of the stimulation period, cells were washed with cold phosphate buffer (137 mm NaCl, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.2) and scraped into 75 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 40 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 nmokadaic acid, pH 7.4). The homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 50,000 × g, and supernatants collected for protein assay and Western blot analysis. Cell lysates (20 μg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (electrophoretic migration was performed during 40 min at 150 V and protein transfer during 1.5 h at 110 V). After transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in a blocking buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dried milk) for 1 h at room temperature. For total p38 MAPK detection, dried milk was replaced by polyvinyl alcohol (1%) in the blocking buffer. Membranes were then incubated for 2 h in the same buffer containing 1% nonfat dried milk or polyvinyl alcohol with polyclonal antibodies raised against phosphorylated p38 MAPK (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) or total p38 MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The membranes were washed with the same buffer without milk or polyvinyl alcohol and then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit (CovalAb, Oullins, France) or rabbit anti-goat (Sigma) antibodies. After washing six times for 10 min, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Statistical significance of differences was assessed by the Student's t test. Probability values ofp < 0.05 were considered as being statistically significant. Caffeine was initially used for investigating the presence and the role of various types of intracellular Ca2+ stores in the response of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells to a challenge with AngII. Surprisingly, we observed that, when added during the sustained phase of the Ca2+response to AngII, caffeine (2 mm) markedly reduced [Ca2+] c in freshly isolated glomerulosa cells (Fig. 1 A). After inhibition by caffeine, nicardipine, a dihydropyridine antagonist, had only a slight effect on calcium levels. Interestingly, the same concentration of caffeine only marginally affected the calcium response to KCl (Fig.1 B) that remained sensitive to nicardipine. Moreover, no additional effect of caffeine was observed when maximal capacitative Ca2+ influx was concomitantly triggered by 200 nm thapsigargin (not shown). The analysis of the concentration dependence of the caffeine-induced inhibition of the Ca2+ signal (Fig. 1 C) revealed that caffeine is much more efficient at reducing the response to AngII (IC50= 1.3 mm) than the response to potassium (IC50> 10 mm), suggesting that the drug interacts with a mechanism specifically generated by AngII. The consequence of calcium inhibition by caffeine on the steroidogenic response to AngII was investigated in primary cultured bovine glomerulosa cells (Fig. 1 D). Whereas basal aldosterone production appeared unaffected by caffeine, AngII-stimulated aldosterone was significantly reduced by 56 ± 5% in the presence of 10 mm caffeine. Aldosterone synthesis was not sensitive to lower concentrations of the drug, despite the marked decrease of the calcium signal observed previously, suggesting that AngII-induced steroidogenesis is also controlled by additional pathways, compensating for the partial decrease of calcium, or that the sensitivity of glomerulosa cells to caffeine is different in freshly prepared cells, used for calcium measurements, and in primary culture. To determine the site and mechanism of caffeine action on AngII-induced calcium signaling, we first measured whether caffeine affects intracellular calcium pools. Preliminary experiments performed with intact cells showed that caffeine (10 mm) had no effect on [Ca2+] c in unstimulated cells and did not significantly reduce the amplitude of the transient [Ca2+] c response to AngII (data not shown). Additional experiments directly assessed the action of caffeine on Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive and -insensitive stores in permeabilized glomerulosa cells (Fig. 2). Whereas the addition of micromolar concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 induced an immediate and transient release of calcium into the ambient medium, low millimolar concentrations of caffeine were inefficient and did not prevent a subsequent response to Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2 A). The integrity of the pools was finally tested by sequential addition of 400 nmthapsigargin, an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+-ATPases (SERCA), and 2 μm ionomycin, a Ca2+ionophore. The lack of caffeine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pools in bovine glomerulosa cells was confirmed by adding increasing concentrations of ryanodine, a drug acting on the same type of Ca2+ stores as caffeine and which could not induce calcium release in permeabilized (Fig. 2 B) as well as in intact glomerulosa cells (data not shown). Moreover, the presence of 10 mm caffeine in the medium did not affect the functional response to Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2 C). Indeed, EC50 values determined in the absence and in the presence of 10 mm caffeine (0.59 and 0.45 μm, respectively) were not significantly different, a finding in agreement with the previous observation that the peak response to AngII was unaffected by caffeine in intact cells. To exclude the possibility that caffeine could modulate calcium levels through an inhibition of the phosphodiesterases and a subsequent elevation of cAMP concentration, we measured the effect of various agents affecting cAMP on Ca2+ homeostasis. As shown in Fig.3, forskolin (25 μm), a pharmacological activator of adenylyl cyclases, was unable to reduce the AngII-induced [Ca2+] c plateau and did not prevent caffeine action. The efficacy of forskolin was indirectly assessed in parallel experiments by measuring aldosterone secretion (Fig. 3, inset). At the same concentration (25 μm), forskolin appeared as potent as AngII (100 nm) to stimulate steroidogenesis, most probably through activation of the cAMP pathway, which, like calcium, is a well recognized modulator of aldosterone biosynthesis. The same results have been obtained with either 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100 μm), an inhibitor of the cAMP phosphodiesterase, or the cell-permeant analog Bu2cAMP (1 mm). Thus, it appears that caffeine action on [Ca2+] c is not mediated by a change in cAMP levels. A reduction of [Ca2+] c , as illustrated in Fig.1 A, can result either from a decrease of calcium influx into the cytosol or from an activation of calcium extrusion. This second possibility was tested by exposing fura-2-loaded cells to AngII in the absence of extracellular calcium. We observed, after a transient response exclusively due to calcium release from intracellular stores, a dramatic acceleration of calcium lowering back to basal levels in the presence of 10 mm caffeine as compared with control cells (Fig. 4). A systematic analysis of the rate of calcium extrusion was performed by fitting the decreasing phase of the calcium response to a single exponential function and by comparing the time constants (t 12). Caffeine significantly reduced calcium half-life in the cytosol, decreasingt 12 from 0.67 ± 0.04 min in control cells to 0.35 ± 0.03 min (Fig. 4, inset). The role of SERCA pumps in calcium extrusion and its possible activation by caffeine was then investigated by repeating the same experiments in the presence of 2 μm thapsigargin, added immediately before AngII. The presence of the latter drug did not significantly affect the kinetics of calcium extrusion and did not prevent caffeine action, suggesting that the activity of SERCA pumps is not limiting in this process. This result was confirmed by the observation that the ATP-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake into the stores of permeabilized cells (152 ± 11 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/15 min) was not increased by 10 mm caffeine (128 ± 8 nmol/mg of protein/15 min,n = 4). Similar results were obtained in the presence of 100 nm AngII (123 ± 13 and 105 ± 19 nmol/mg of protein/15 min in control cells and in caffeine-treated cells, respectively). In order to test the role of the NCX in Ca2+ extrusion from the cytosol, we pretreated the cells with 50 μm diltiazem, a known inhibitor of this protein, before inducing calcium release with AngII in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Under these conditions, we observed a marked decrease of the rate of calcium extrusion, the t 12 value increasing from 0.7 to 2.7 min (Fig. 5, Ctrl). This result suggests that the activity of the NCX controls the rate of Ca2+ extrusion. It is noteworthy that an inhibition by diltiazem of the voltage-operated Ca2+ channels is unlikely to be responsible for this effect on Ca2+ extrusion, because Ca2+ is absent from the medium and because the addition of nifedipine, another blocker of these channels, did not change"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether brief exposure of cardiac fibroblasts to H2O2 is associated with transient changes in [Ca2+] i levels and whether this stimulus is sufficient to induce interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. Cardiac derived fibroblasts were isolated from adult male rats and cultured under standard conditions. Individual coverslip-attached fibroblasts were loaded with the calcium probe Fura-2/AM and exposed to a single 3-min pulse of 100 μmH2O2. In addition, low passage cultures were exposed to a pulse of H2O2 and assayed for IL-6 expression. A brief exposure of H2O2 led to a large intracellular Ca2+ transient with a mean transient magnitude of 318 ± 28 nm (mean ± S.D.,n = 12). Stimulation in the absence of [Ca2+] o led to a 59% reduction in mean transient magnitude (129 ± 23 nm, n = 10,p < 0.001), whereas pretreatment with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor blocker xestospongin C resulted in a 37% reduction (199 ± 25 nm, n = 10, p < 0.01). Cells treated with xestospongin C and stimulated in the absence of [Ca2+] o did not exhibit a Ca2+ transient. Time-dependent IL-6 release was significantly elevated by 4 h (368 ± 64 pg/mg protein, p < 0.01) and increased further by 24 h (1030 ± 76 pg/mg protein). The depletion of cellular Ca2+ by pretreatment with thapsigargin in the absence of [Ca2+] o attenuated H2O2-induced IL-6 mRNA expression while blocking protein release. These data show that the exposure of cardiac fibroblasts to a brief pulse of physiological levels of H2O2 resulted in a large Ca2+transient with intracellular and extracellular Ca2+contributions. Furthermore, brief H2O2 exposure led to calcium-dependent IL-6 expression.

Through the use of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and spin-trapping techniques, the bulk of ROS production was shown to occur during the first 5 min of reperfusion, being maximal at 2 min (1Bolli R.

Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1919-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously shown that reperfusion is followed by the activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors with the generation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (7Chandrasekar B. Colston J.T. Freeman G.L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 108: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Chandrasekar B. Streitman J.E. Colston J.T. Freeman G.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, a broad range of biological effects results from the post-ischemic ROS transient. In nonexcitable cells, exposure to oxidative stress has been shown to cause a calcium transient. Qin et al. (10Qin S. Stadtman E.R. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7118-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have shown that exposure of B cells to peroxide leads to an increase of intracellular calcium with a very rapid onset. In a series of elegant experiments, these workers showed that phospholipase Cγ mediated the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to IP3, which led to the calcium mobilization. Given the fact that the ultrastructural work by Nag et al. (11Nag A.C. Cytobios. 1980; 28: 41-61PubMed Google Scholar) and Eghbali et al. (12Eghbali M. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1992; 87: 183-189PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that 65–70% of the cells in the myocardium are non-myocytes with fibroblasts widely scattered throughout the tissue, these findings suggest that these cells may manifest a calcium transient following ischemia reperfusion. Given the known role of calcium as a regulator of gene transcription, it is possible that this could be a regulatory mechanism in the post-ischemic myocardium. Fibroblasts are a rich source of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors and play a vital role in remodeling, making this possibility one that is of considerable interest. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the exposure of cardiac derived fibroblasts (CDFs) to H2O2 for a brief time would cause a rise in intracellular calcium. We hypothesized that this would be the case and that the calcium signal would modulate gene expression in these cells. Our results demonstrate the occurrence of this phenomenon and that abrogation of the calcium signal following H2O2 exposure blunted the expression of IL-6, indicating that the ROS-induced calcium transient has a role in gene regulation that is distinct from the direct effects of the oxidative stress. The investigation conforms with a report published previously (for review see Ref. 13National Institutes of Health Guide to the Care and Use of Animals.Office of Science and Health Reports (DHEW Publication Number 85-23). DRR/National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1985Google Scholar). CDFs were isolated from the hearts of adult male Wistar Kyoto rats (200–250 g) using a method developed in our laboratory. After induction of deep anesthesia with an intramuscular injection (0.2–0.3 ml) containing a mixture of ketamine acepromazine xylazine (9:3:1), hearts were rapidly removed, rinsed, and mounted via the aorta onto an 18-gauge cannula attached to a Langendorff-type apparatus, allowing retrograde perfusion of the coronary arteries. Hearts were perfused for 5 min with 37 °C sterile filtered calcium-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (110 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose) at 80 mm Hg. Hearts were then perfused for 25 min with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer enzyme solution containing 0.5 mg/ml type II collagenase (Worthington), 25 μmCaCl2, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free albumin. After digestion, the ventricles were trimmed free and minced in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer enzyme solution containing 10 mg/ml albumin, filtered through sterile nylon mesh, and centrifuged at 25 × g for 5 min to remove cardiomyocytes, red blood cells, and debris. The resultant supernatant was then centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 8 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of CDF medium (15 mm HEPES, 16.7 mm NaHCO3, 1× each of basal medium Eagle vitamins and minimum Eagle's medium-amino acids (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, pH 7.3) and plated into T75 tissue culture flasks (Falcon, BD PharMingen). Nonadherent cells were removed after 2 h and discarded. Cells were fed with fresh medium three times per week using CDF medium and split 1:3 when confluent. CDF and non-fibroblast contaminants were identified by immunofluorescence using routine methods (14Colston J.T. Chandrasekar B. Freeman G.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 38: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with the following antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD-31, Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ), anti-vimentin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-smooth muscle actin (Sigma). After two serial passages, >99.7% of cells in these cultures exhibit vimentin and β-actin immunoreactivity, are CD-31- and smooth muscle actin-negative, and display typical fibroblast-like morphology. Non-fibroblast cells typically account for <0.1% of total cells as determined by immunofluorescence. Cardiac-derived fibroblasts were used in these experiments between the third and sixth passage. Rat heart-derived vascular endothelial cells (EC) were kindly provided by Dr. C. A. Diglio (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI) (15Diglio C.A. Grammas P. Giacomelli F. Wiener J. Tissue Cell. 1988; 20: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cultured EC showed positive vimentin and CD-31 immunoreactivity as determined by immunofluorescence and exhibited the cobblestone growth pattern typical of EC in culture. Smooth muscle actin immunoreactivity was not detected in these cultures. Embryonic mouse fibroblasts (NIH-3T3) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1658). Both EC and NIH-3T3 cells were cultured under conditions identical to those described for CDFs and split 1:3 when confluent. Intracellular calcium measurements were made in individual coverslip-attached fibroblasts using the calcium-sensitive probe Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (16Takahashi A. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Herman B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1089-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). CDFs were plated onto sterilized round coverglass (25-mm thickness 1, Warner Instrument Corp., Camden, CT) and cultured overnight in CDF medium. Prior to study, coverslip-attached CDFs were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM in perfusion buffer for 45 min at 37 °C. Following incubation, the coverslip-attached cells were washed three times with perfusion buffer and mounted in a perfusion chamber for study. Intracellular ROS levels were measured in individual CDFs loaded with dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes). Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate is converted to the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein in the presence of ROS. Coverslip-attached CDF cells were incubated with 5 μm dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate for 20 min in perfusion buffer and then washed three times prior to study (17Killilea D.W. Hester R. Balczon R. Babal P. Gillespie M.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L408-L412PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslip-attached CDF cells were mounted in a closed perfusion chamber (RC-21BRF, Warner) and maintained at 37 °C constant temperature (Temperature Controller (TC-324B), Warner) throughout the experiment. The cells were continually superfused at a rate of 2 ml/min with oxygen-saturated perfusion buffer (137 mm NaCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 7 H2O, 4.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mmHEPES, 15 mm d-glucose, 1.8 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4). The perfusion chamber was mounted on the stage of an inverted fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE200, Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) mated to an imaging and photon counting system (Ion Optix, Milton, MA). Individual CDFs were studied using a ×20 objective after being optically isolated with manual-controlled shutters, a region that ranged from 0.01 to 0.04 mm2. Photon counts, image storage, and rapid filter changes were controlled by microcomputer. Data storage and analysis were performed using IonWizard analysis software (Ion Optix). Intracellular calcium levels were calculated automatically using the equation described by Grynkiewicz et al. (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) after routine calibration. R max andR min were determined routinely using two methods, Fura-2/AM pentapotassium salt (5 μm) with known [Ca2+] and in situ calibration using ionomycin with nominal and high [Ca2+]. Interleukin-6 protein release into CDF culture supernatants was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay following protocols by the manufacturer (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) using a computer-controlled enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (SpectraMAX 190, Molecular Devices). Triplicate cultures for each treatment and time point were used for IL-6 analyses with individual samples assayed in duplicate. IL-6 levels were determined from standard curves performed for each assay and normalized to total protein content. IL-6 mRNA levels were determined in treated and control CDFs by Northern blotting as described previously (8Chandrasekar B. Streitman J.E. Colston J.T. Freeman G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For each study, ANOVA was performed to determine whether statistically significant differences were present across treatments or times within treatments. If the F-test from ANOVA was statistically significant (p < 0.05), Bonferroni-adjusted Student's t tests were performed for the pairwise treatment or time comparisons of interest withp < 0.05 considered as significant. The F-test for peak Ca2+ across treatments was significant (p < 0.001); therefore, pairwise comparisons between control and each of the five other treatments were performed. The F-test for IL-6 across time within H2O2 was significant (p < 0.001); therefore a profile analysis was performed to identify time intervals at which significant increases of IL-6 were observed. The experiment was repeated with expanded time intervals for H2O2, TG, and TG + H2O2 treatments. The F-tests for H2O2 (p < 0.001) and TG + H2O2 (p < 0.04) were significant, so profile analyses were performed for these treatments; however, the F-test for TG (p = 0.06) was not significant. The F-test for optical density across time within H2O2 was significant (p < 0.001), so a profile analysis was performed. The F-test for optical density across treatments at 4 h was significant (p < 0.001), and for this experiment, all possible pairwise comparisons among treatments were performed. The exposure of cardiac-derived fibroblasts to a brief 3-min pulse of 100 μm H2O2 led to a large transient increase in [Ca2+] i . Fig.1 A shows a typical [Ca2+] i tracing from one treated CDF along with a representative tracing from a non-H2O2-stimulated cell monitored for the same time period. As shown in this figure, [Ca2+] i began to rise several minutes after initial H2O2 exposure peaking at ∼25 min (23.3 ± 6.2 min) after which levels returned to below base line with an average transient duration of 44 ± 7.6 min. Basal [Ca2+] i was 81 ± 21 nm(mean ± S.D., n = 12) prior to H2O2 exposure and 19 ± 7 nmpost-transient. Non-H2O2-exposed CDFs did not exhibit any large fluxes in [Ca2+] i . Similarly, neither heart-derived endothelial cells nor NIH-3T3 fibroblasts exhibited detectable Ca2+ fluxes following brief peroxide exposure. A protocol was developed enabling the production of a calcium transient in CDFs in the absence of exogenously applied H2O2. As shown in Fig. 1 B, this method produced a transient of similar magnitude and duration to those observed in peroxide-treated cells. Conversely, cells were stimulated with H2O2 following pretreatment with thapsigargin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. This treatment allowed peroxide exposure in the absence of detectable calcium fluxes (Fig. 1 B, dashed trace). The source(s) of Ca2+ that gave rise to the observed transients in CDF, whether it was from intracellular or external pools, and the mechanisms responsible for these fluxes were investigated. Fig.2 A shows that the average Ca2+ transient magnitude in cells exposed briefly to H2O2 was 318 ± 28 nm(Con). When cells were stimulated with H2O2 in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (no Ca), the transient magnitude was significantly reduced by 59% to 129 ± 23 nm(p < 0.001). In contrast, when cells were pretreated with the IP3 receptor blocker xestospongin C (XeC), which then was exposed to H2O2, the transient magnitude was reduced by 37% to 199 ± 25 nm(p < 0.01). These results suggest that approximately two-thirds of the H2O2-induced Ca2+flux was transplasmalemmal, whereas one-third was from internal IP3-sensitive stores. Furthermore, pretreatment with XeC followed by H2O2 stimulation in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (XeC no Ca) completely inhibited the development of an intracellular Ca2+transient. These results indicate that the H2O2-induced Ca2+ transient arises from extracellular and IP3-sensitive stores without significant contributions from mitochondrial, nuclear, or other intracellular pools. Because the major source of Ca2+ was extracellular, we investigated whether this was attributed to the opening of L-type calcium channels in the plasma membrane. L-type calcium channels are ubiquitous large conductance voltage-activated channels and have been demonstrated in fibroblasts (19Shivakumar K. Kumaran C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 373-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, pretreatment with the calcium channel blocker verapamil (Ver) had no significant effect on peak transient magnitude. These results suggest this route of entry is unlikely to contribute significantly to the observed transient. As shown earlier, the minor component of the H2O2-induced Ca2+ transient resulted from intracellular IP3-sensitive stores. IP3 may be formed as a result of phospholipase C activation following ligand binding to specific G-protein-coupled receptors in the plasma membrane. Alternately, IP3 may be formed by PI3K through a non-receptor-mediated mechanism. Pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (WM) resulted in a similar reduction in H2O2-induced Ca2+ transient magnitude as compared with pretreatment with the IP3receptor blocker XeC (229 ± 23 and 199 ± 25 nm,p < 0.05 and p < 0.01versus Con, respectively). These results indicate that de novo IP3 formation through the activity of PI3K is a probable mechanism leading to H2O2-induced intracellular Ca2+release. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that reperfusion of previously ischemic myocardium is associated with the up-regulation of various proinflammatory mediators including interleukin-6. Thus, we investigated whether the H2O2-induced transient is linked to the expression of IL-6. Cells grown in culture were stimulated with a brief pulse of H2O2 and assayed at various times for IL-6 production. Fig.3 A shows the H2O2-induced time-dependent release of IL-6 protein into culture supernatants. As shown in this figure, significant amounts of IL-6 were detected by 4 h (p < 0.01) and increased thereafter until 24 h. By comparison, nonstimulated cells accumulated significantly lower levels of IL-6 by 24 h as compared with H2O2-treated cells (p < 0.001). Because the exposure of cells to a brief pulse of H2O2 resulted in a large Ca2+transient and IL-6 release in CDFs, we investigated whether the transient influx of Ca2+ was a necessary component of the H2O2-induced signaling pathway, leading to IL-6 expression. To address this possibility, we depleted the cells of [Ca2+] i by pretreating CDFs with thapsigargin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (see Fig. 1 B,dashed trace). Importantly, replacing the Ca2+-free buffer with medium containing normal Ca2+ 30 min after H2O2 exposure did not lead to a large influx of Ca2+. Fig. 3 Bdemonstrates the effects of Ca2+ depletion (TG+H 2 O 2 ) on H2O2-induced IL-6 production as compared with cells stimulated in the presence of normal Ca2+(H 2 O 2 ). As Fig. 3 demonstrates, the stimulation of CDFs in the absence of a Ca2+ transient resulted in IL-6 expression at levels that were not significantly different from unstimulated cells at 24 h (see Fig. 3 A) and non-H2O2-stimulated cells depleted of Ca2+ (TG) at each time point. Interestingly, the exposure of cells to H2O2 was not associated with detectable changes in intracellular 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence, indicating that stimulation with a brief pulse of H2O2 does not result in a large intracellular burst of ROS (data not shown). These results taken together suggest that it is Ca2+ influx and not the H2O2 exposure per se that leads to IL-6 protein release by CDF. Fig. 4 A shows the time-dependent increase in IL-6 mRNA in peroxide-stimulated CDFs. Because IL-6 induction was significant by 4 h following H2O2 exposure (p < 0.001 versus 2 h), we compared mRNA levels at that time in peroxide-stimulated and untreated control CDFs to those stimulated with H2O2 in which calcium fluxes were not allowed and to cells that were not exposed to peroxide but in which calcium transients were induced. This approach allowed individual assessment of the impact of peroxide and calcium in IL-6 regulation (Fig. 4 B). The data indicate that either peroxide exposure or calcium influx alone is sufficient to significantly induce IL-6 mRNA expression (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively, versusuntreated), although neither was as potent a stimulus as peroxide exposure and calcium influx together (p < 0.001versus untreated). In addition, these data suggest that the presence of a calcium stimulus may regulate IL-6 protein release to a greater extent than mRNA levels (see Fig. 3 B). The results from this study demonstrate for the first time that brief exposure of cardiac fibroblasts to physiological levels of H2O2 results in a large Ca2+transient and Ca2+-dependent induction of IL-6. The investigations by Bolli et al. (1Bolli R. Patel B.S. Jeroudi M.O. Lai E.K. McCay P.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and others (20Zweier J.L. Flaherty J.T. Weisfeldt M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 21Sharikabad M.N. Ostbye K.M. Lyberg T. Brors O. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H344-H353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that reperfusion of previously ischemic myocardium leads to a transient production and release of ROS including H2O2. In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated that ischemia/reperfusion injury is associated with an inflammatory response characterized by significant infiltration of neutrophils into the myocardium, especially after longer ischemic episodes (22Frangogiannis N.G. Youker K.A. Entman M.L. Experientia Supplementum. 1996; 76: 263-284PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jordan J.E. Zhao Z-Q. Vinten-Johansen J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 860-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). It has been shown that local concentrations of H2O2 in the microenvironment adjacent to neutrophils may reach 100 μm (24Schraufstatter I. Hyslop P.A. Jackson J.H. Cochrane C.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 25Varani J. Ginsburg I. Schuger L. Gibbs D.F. Bromberg J. Johnson K.J. Ryan U.S. Ward P.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 435-438PubMed Google Scholar). Given that cardiac fibroblasts representing the most numerous cell types in the heart are in contact with working myocytes and are known to participate in post-ischemic remodeling, the response of these cells to transient physiological levels of H2O2 probably represents an important myocardial process contributing to post-ischemic inflammatory pathobiology. As shown in Fig. 1 A, brief exposure of primary adult CDFs to H2O2 resulted in a large nearly symmetrical Ca2+ transient characterized by its long duration and delayed onset. Furthermore, after [Ca2+] i returned to post-transient base-line levels, cells could be restimulated with brief H2O2 exposure to produce an additional transient (data not shown). Roveri et al. (26Roveri A. Coassin M. Maiorino M. Zamburlini A. van Amsterdam F. Ratti E. Ursini F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) showed that exogenous peroxide exposure led to Ca2+ transients in smooth muscle cells characterized by their rapid onset and short duration (<5 min) and elevated post-transient base-line Ca2+ levels. These authors showed that the initial rise in [Ca2+] i was because of the release of IP3-sensitive stores, whereas elevated post-transient base-line levels were because of Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that was preventable using calcium channel blockers or antioxidants. Our results are suggestive of a different mechanism of Ca2+ influx, because as shown in Fig. 2 A, pretreatment with the calcium channel blocker verapamil had a minimal effect on peak [Ca2+] i levels following H2O2 exposure. These differences may reflect alternate mechanisms for Ca2+handling in excitable versus nonexcitable cells and/or differences in the concentration and duration of H2O2 exposure. It is noteworthy that these authors (26Roveri A. Coassin M. Maiorino M. Zamburlini A. van Amsterdam F. Ratti E. Ursini F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) observe that at lower concentrations of H2O2 (<150 μm), slower Ca2+ transients were seen in isolated smooth muscle cells, although the data were not presented. The fact that H2O2 concentrations vary greatly among the many published studies on the cellular effects of exogenous H2O2 exposure ranging from submicromolar to millimolar concentrations contributes to the difficulty in comparing results from these studies and establishing unambiguous mechanisms that are biologically relevant. Importantly, we did not observe Ca2+ transients in either rat heart-derived vascular EC or mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts following brief peroxide exposure. The observed difference in calcium response among peroxide-stimulated EC, NIH-3T3, and CDF suggests that cardiac fibroblasts may possess unique signaling mechanisms essential to their role(s) in regulating cardiac growth and interstitial structural adaptations (fibrosis) in the heart. In 1986, Putney (27Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar) first proposed a model for receptor-regulated Ca2+ entry into nonexcitable cells termed capacitative calcium entry. Noncapacitative Ca2+entry mechanisms have also been described in cells without electrically excitable membranes (28Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 159-169Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our results do not entirely support the capacitative model in H2O2-induced Ca2+ transients in cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. Consistent with this model, we observed H2O2-induced Ca2+ release from internal stores involved in IP3-sensitive pools, because as shown in Fig. 2 A, the blockade of the IP3 receptor using XeC significantly attenuated peak transient levels. Any role for ryanodine receptors was eliminated, because pretreatment with ryanodine was without effect (data not shown). Furthermore, pretreatment with XeC in the absence of [Ca2+] o completely blocked transient development, indicating that the Ca2+ responsible for the observed transients was largely limited to two sources, IP3-sensitive intracellular pools and extracellular medium. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 1 B, the depletion of cellular calcium following pretreatment with thapsigargin in Ca2+-free medium followed by H2O2stimulation blocked transient development. Subsequent replacement of extracellular calcium 30 min after stimulation did not result in significant Ca2+ entry or “overshoot” as predicted by the capacitative model (29van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L., Ma, H.T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28562-28568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, IP3 receptor blockade using XeC reduced calcium transient magnitude but did not block H2O2-induced Ca2+ entry (Fig.2 A). Thus, our results indicate that the observed H2O2-induced transients in CDFs in vitro resulted from a noncapacitative entry mechanism. Hydrogen peroxide is a highly reactive biologically important molecule that is released by cells in response to various stimuli. The primary effects of exogenous H2O2 exposure result from the oxidization of membrane lipids, proteins, and membrane-associated molecules. Following exogenous application of H2O2, we did not observe a detectable burst of intracellular free radicals as measured by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence (data not shown) during a time when significant Ca2+ fluxes were observed. As shown in Fig. 2 B, pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin resulted in a similar reduction in transient magnitude as compared with pretreatment with XeC, suggesting that de novo IP3 formation may result from the activation of membrane-associated PI3K. This mechanism is supported by the observations of Qin et al. (10Qin S. Stadtman E.R. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7118-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) demonstrating that H2O2 is capable of activating PI3K. Our results do not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms, e.g. phospholipase C activation, may contribute to IP3 production and subsequent intracellular Ca2+ release. In fact, H2O2-induced calcium fluxes in CDFs are probably a complex phenomenon resulting from internal release, external influx, and altered extrusion and re-uptake mechanisms. Previous studies from our laboratory (7Chandrasekar B. Colston J.T. Freeman G.L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 108: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Chandrasekar B. Streitman J.E. Colston J.T. Freeman G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Chandrasekar B. Smith J.B. Freeman G.L. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2296-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that myocardial production and release of proinflammatory mediators including IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and nitric oxide are associated with ischemia/reperfusion injury. Preliminary studies from our laboratory have shown that adult cardiac derived fibroblasts are capable of producing tumor necrosis factor-α and large amounts of IL-6 in vitro following lipopolysaccharide exposure (30Colston J.T. Chandrasekar B. Freeman G.L. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2000; 35: 331AGoogle Scholar). In addition, we have recently demonstrated a coordinated expression of IL-6, IL-6R, and the signal transducer gp130 during reperfusion of previously ischemic myocardium (31Chandrasekar B. Mitchell D.H. Colston J.T. Freeman G.L. Circulation. 1999; 99: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interleukin-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine whose expression is modulated by the redox state of the cell (32Libermann T.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cytokine has been shown to depress myocardial contraction, play a role in apoptosis, and induce the expressions of adhesion and other proinflammatory molecules (for review see Ref. 33Wollert K.C. Drexler H. Heart Failure Rev. 2001; 6: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Given the local production and release of H2O2 by myocytes and neutrophils, we investigated whether such exposure would be sufficient to induce IL-6 expression. Brief peroxide exposure led to the time-dependent accumulation of IL-6 protein (Fig.3 A) and mRNA (Fig. 4 A). Interleukin-6 protein levels were 5-fold higher in peroxide-exposed cells after 24 h as compared with unstimulated control cultures. We had previously established that re-exposure of Ca2+-depleted fibroblasts to medium containing normal Ca2+ (1.8 mm) did not lead to large Ca2+ fluxes (Fig. 1 B). This allowed us to stimulate CDFs with brief H2O2exposure without the production of a Ca2+ transient to investigate the importance of calcium signaling in H2O2-induced IL-6 expression. The stimulation of CDFs with H2O2 in the absence of a Ca2+ transient (Fig. 3 B,TG+H 2 O 2 ) effectively blocked IL-6 protein release with levels similar to unstimulated Ca2+-depleted cells (TG) and unstimulated control cells (Fig. 3 A, no H 2 O 2 ). This treatment blunted but did not eliminate IL-6 mRNA induction (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, the production of a calcium transient in the absence of exogenous peroxide also attenuated mRNA levels although to a lesser extent, indicating that neither Ca2+ nor peroxide alone exclusively regulates IL-6 gene activity. The results from these experiments demonstrate the Ca2+ dependence of H2O2-induced IL-6 release, suggesting that the peroxide-induced calcium transient may serve as a signal in the subsequent induction and release of this important proinflammatory mediator. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that brief exposure of primary adult CDFs to physiological levels of H2O2leads to a large symmetrical calcium transient characterized by a delayed onset and long duration. The transient arises from both a minor component resulting from intracellular release from IP3-sensitive stores and a major component represented by extracellular Ca2+ influx. In addition, our results show that brief H2O2 exposure leads to time-dependent release of IL-6, which did not occur in the absence of significant Ca2+ fluxes. We thank Robert A.

It possesses two-pairs of vicinal cysteine residues, Cys12-Cys13 and Cys112-Cys113, that potentially form separate binding sites for the metalloids that trigger dissociation of ArsD from the operon. However, as a homodimer it has four vicinal cysteine pairs. Titration of the steady-state fluorescence of ArsD with metalloids revealed positive cooperativity, with a Hill coefficient of 2, between these sites.

The kinetics of metalloid binding were determined by stopped flow spectroscopy; the rate increased in a sigmoidal manner, with a Hill coefficient of 4, indicating that the pre-steady-state measurements reported cooperativity between all four sites of the dimer rather than just the intermolecular interactions reported by the steady-state measurements. The kinetics of Sb(III) displacement by As(III) revealed that the metalloid-binding sites behave differentially, with the rapid exchange of As(III) for Sb(III) at one site retarding the release of Sb(III) from the other sites.

Rosen B.P. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Dekker, New York1995: 103-132Google Scholar). A common homeostatic mechanism is the use of efflux systems, such as transport ATPases, to control the level of these soft metals in the cell. Failure of these regulatory systems can lead to genetic disorders, such as Menkes' disease and Wilson's disease in humans, caused by mutations in two Cu(I) pumps (2Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S.

Consequently, understanding the mechanism controlling the expression of these efflux pumps and the basis of their selectivity for toxic soft metals is of paramount importance. A common feature of the protein components of these regulatory systems is the use of pairs of cysteine residues to chelate the soft metals, with multiple copies of these soft metal-chelating sites occurring within each protein. However, there have been no transient kinetic studies, with the potential to define cooperative interactions, of metal or metalloid binding to such sites; consequently, the binding mechanism has not been elucidated, and our knowledge of the role played by the individual binding sites is still rudimentary. High level resistance to arsenite and antimonite in Escherichia coli is conferred by the arsRDABC operon of plasmid R773 (7Chen C.M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The arsA and arsB genes encode the ATPase and membrane translocase subunits of an arsenical pump (8Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Zhou T. Walmsley A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas the arsC gene encodes an arsenate reductase that is required to catalyze the reduction of arsenate to arsenite prior to extrusion (9Oden K.L.

The products of the arsD andarsR genes, which encode trans-acting repressors that bind to the ars operon, control the expression of the operon (14Xu C. Shi W. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2427-2432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 15Chen Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14257-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ArsR is a 117-residue protein that functions as a homodimer, repressing expression of the operon to a basal level in the absence of arsenite or antimonite, but in the presence of these metalloids it dissociates from the DNA, and transcription ensues. ArsD is also a homodimer of two 120-residue subunits that binds to the same operator site as ArsR but with an affinity that is 2 orders of magnitude less than that of ArsR. Consequently, ArsD only binds to thears operon when produced in high concentrations, such as after prolonged stimulation of transcription of the arsDgene following induction by arsenite or antimonite. It has been proposed that ArsD controls the maximal level of expression of the operon, preventing the build-up of ArsB, which at high levels appears toxic to the cell (15Chen Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14257-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although ArsD has an affinity for arsenite that is an order of magnitude lower than ArsR, at sufficiently high levels of arsenite, ArsD dissociates, and the operon is again transcribed. In both ArsR and ArsD vicinal pairs of cysteine residues have been shown to be involved in coordinating the metalloid (16Shi W. Dong J. Scott R.A. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9291-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Li S. Chen Y. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The homodimeric ArsR has only a single metalloid blinding site/monomer, utilizing the Cys32-Cys34 pair to coordinate metalloids, whereas ArsD appears to have two, or four one-half metalloid-binding sites/monomer, utilizing the Cys12-Cys13 and Cys112-Cys113 pairs to coordinate metalloids. Substitution of either of these cysteine pairs in ArsD abolished metalloid inducibility but did not affect repression, indicating that these cysteine residues form metalloid-binding sites (17Li S. Chen Y. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine whether these sites are independent or whether they interact and to elucidate the mechanism of metalloid binding to these sites. ArsD and its derivatives were purified as described previously (17Li S. Chen Y. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), quickly frozen, and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. The concentrations of purified ArsD and its derivatives were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. An ArsD derivative in which the Cys119and Cys120 residues were deleted and in which a His6 tag was added to the C terminus was used as the basis for the construction of further derivatives in which the other cysteine residues were systematically changed to alanines. Fluorescence measurements were made in a Jasco FP750 fluorimeter at 20 °C. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, and the emission wavelength was scanned between 300 and 400 nm. For titrations, Sb(III) was added as potassium antimonial tartrate from 1, 10, or 100 mm stock solutions to 2 ml of 1 μm ArsD protein (in 50 mmMOPS-KOH,1 pH 7.5, 0.25 mm EDTA), so that the original sample was not diluted by more than 10%. The protein fluorescence and the Sb(III) concentration were corrected for the dilution effect. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were also carried out in anApplied Photophysics (London, UK) SX.18MV stopped flow instrument operated at 20 °C. For measurements of the change in tryptophan fluorescence, the samples were excited with light at 295 nm and selected with a monochromator, and the emission was monitored at wavelengths above 335 nm using a cut-off filter. Routinely, equal volumes of the reactants were mixed together in the stopped flow instrument, using two syringes of equal volume. The concentration of ArsD was 1 μm, unless otherwise noted, in 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm EDTA. All of the concentrations are for the mixing chamber unless stated otherwise, so that the concentrations in the syringe were twice those quoted for the mixing chamber. To set up the stopped flow instrument, 1 μm ArsD protein was mixed with buffer, and the photomultiplier tube voltage was increased until a 4 V signal was achieved. Fluorescence changes were recorded as an increase or decrease in this 4 V signal (i.e. an increase in the signal from 4 to 4.1 V would correspond to a 2.5% increase in fluorescence and a decrease from 4 to 3.9 V would correspond to a 2.5% quench in fluorescence), which was backed off to zero, and changes above and below this zero base line were recorded. Stopped flow traces were analyzed by fitting to single (s =A·exp− kt ; where srepresents the change in signal (e.g. volts or percentage of fluorescence), t represents the time, and A andk represent the amplitude and rate constant for the signal change, respectively) or multiple exponential functions (s =A 1·exp− k (1) t +A 2·exp− k (2) t +A 3·exp− k (3) t , for a triple exponential function) using the nonlinear regression software with the Applied Photophysics stopped flow. Concentration dependence data were analyzed by nonlinear regression fitting to sigmoidal or hyperbolic functions, as required, using Sigmaplot 4.0. Drug titration curves were fitted to a sigmoidal function by nonlinear regression using the program Sigma Plot from Jandel Scientific.ΔF=ΔFmax·[Sb(III)]n/K1/2n+[Sb(III)]nEquation 1 where ΔF is the quench in protein fluorescence, ΔF max is the maximum fluorescence quench,K 12 is the half-saturation constant, andn is the Hill coefficient. The binding of Sb(III) and As(III) to ArsD induces a quench in the protein fluorescence (17Li S. Chen Y. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that was used to titrate the ArsD metalloid-binding site. ArsD contains only two tryptophan residues, Trp35 and Trp97, of which only the latter contributes to metalloid responsiveness. In a previous study we established that although the vicinal cysteine pair Cys119-Cys120 could bind metalloids, it did not have an apparent effect on repression or metalloid responsivenessin vivo or in vitro (17Li S. Chen Y. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Accordingly, to avoid complications in the interpretation of the data for the binding of Sb(III) to ArsD and to provide the base-line data for our study, we produced and characterized a C-terminal His-tagged Cys119-Cys120 deletion derivative of ArsD, which, for simplicity, we refer to as ArsD throughout the manuscript and into which further amino acid substitutions were introduced. The titration curves for the binding of Sb(III) and As(III) to 1 μm of ArsD (i.e. the Cys119-Cys120 deletion derivative) indicated that binding is a cooperative process (Fig.1) and was characterized by Hill coefficients of 2.1 ± 0.2 and 2.1 ± 0.1 and maximal quenches in the protein fluorescence of 56 ± 1 and 26 ± 1% for Sb(III) and As(III), respectively. However, the titration curve for Sb(III) was to the left of that for As(III), withK 12 values of 1.7 ± 0.6 and 11.2 ± 4.5 μm, respectively, indicating that ArsD has higher affinity for Sb(III) than As(III). Comparatively, the His-tagged wild type protein (termed wild type ArsD), which possessed the Cys119 and Cys120 residues, behaved in an identical manner (Table I).Table ISteady-state titration data for ArsD and its substitution derivativesArsD derivativesFluorescence quenchHill coefficient %Native Wild type ArsD (Sb)1-aWild-type ArsD bearing a C-terminal His6 tag.52 ± 52.0 ± 0.2 ArsD (Cys119-Cys120deletion) (Sb)55 ± 52.2 ± 0.2 ArsD (Cys119-Cys120 deletion) (As)26 ± 42.1 ± 0.2Single substitutions1-bArsD Cys-Ala derivatives were constructed in the ArsD (Cys119-Cys120 deletion) derivative.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the molecular basis of the cooperative interactions between the metalloid-responsive binding sites of dimeric ArsD, Cys12, Cys13, Cys112, and Cys113 were systematically substituted by alanine residues to disrupt each potential binding site. Our previous studies suggested that the vicinal cysteine pairs Cys12-Cys13 and Cys112-Cys113 form separate metalloid-binding sites. As shown in Table I, disruption of the Cys12-Cys13 site by replacing either Cys12, Cys13, or both did not affect the cooperativity in the binding of Sb(III). In contrast, disruption of the Cys112-Cys113 site caused a major reduction in the binding cooperativity. This behavior indicates that the observed cooperativity probably does not arise from interactions between the Cys12-Cys13 and Cys112-Cys113 sites but more likely arises from interactions between Cys112-Cys113 sites of the dimer. Indeed, not only does disruption of the Cys112-Cys113 site reduce cooperativity but also causes a 75–80% reduction in the fluorescence response of the protein to the binding of Sb(III), suggesting that the changes in ArsD fluorescence are primarily reporting events at the Cys112-Cys113 site. Consequently, the titration curves for ArsD might only reflect filling of the two Cys112-Cys113 sites in dimeric ArsD, and cooperative interactions with the Cys12-Cys13sites might go unobserved. It is important to note that although disruption of the Cys112-Cys113 sites dramatically reduces the cooperative effects, these are not totally abolished. For example, the Hill coefficient for C112A/C113A ArsD was 1.1. These data suggest that there is cooperativity between the Cys12-Cys13 and Cys112-Cys113 sites in addition to that between the Cys112-Cys113 sites of the dimer. Interestingly, C12A/C13A/C112A ArsD was able to bind Sb(III), but in a noncooperative manner (e.g. K m = 417 + 24 μm; Table I), whereas C12A/C13A/C112A/C113A ArsD was optically unresponsive, presumably because it did not bind Sb(III). Because a vicinal cysteine pair is generally considered necessary to bind the metalloid or metal, this suggests that the binding sites are formed between the cysteine residues of adjacent monomers within the dimer. We utilized the Sb(III)-induced quench in ArsD protein fluorescence to time resolve the interaction of Sb(III) with ArsD by stopped flow fluorescence spectroscopy. The stopped flow trace shown in Fig.2, for the mixing of 1 μmArsD with 120 μm Sb(III), indicates a multiphasic decrease in fluorescence over the first 10 s of the reaction, followed by a small increase in fluorescence over the next 90 s. When the reaction was studied over a longer time, it became apparent that the increase in fluorescence was transient and that it decreased over longer times (data not shown). The trace was best fitted to a triple-exponential function, with rate constants of 290 ± 6 s−1 (phase 1; 59.5% of fluorescence quench), 24 ± 2 s−1 (phase 2; 40.5% of fluorescence quench), and 0.003 ± 0.001 s−1 (phase 3). It should be noted that phase 3 defines the small increase in fluorescence over the last 90 s of the trace and is attributed a “negative amplitude.” As indicated in Fig. 2, there is a loss of amplitude because a large proportion of phase 1 occurs in the dead time of the stopped flow; the difference in the fluorescence of ArsD mixed with buffer (trace A) and 120 μm Sb(III) (trace B) is indicative of a 39% quench in the fluorescence of ArsD by 120 μm Sb(III), which is reasonably consistent with the maximal fluorescence quench determined in steady-state fluorescence titrations performed with the same protein preparation (i.e. this preparation gave a maximal steady-state quench of 45%). For lower concentrations of Sb(III), the stopped flow traces were adequately defined by a double-exponential function, without phase 3. The dependence of the rate of each phase upon the Sb(III) concentration was investigated. The rates of phases 1 and 2 clearly increased in a sigmoidal manner (Fig. 3), whereas phase 3 had no significant dependence upon concentration, indicative of a conformational isomerization of the ArsD-Sb(III) complex (data not shown). The data for each phase were fitted to the following equation, 2Only the data points corresponding to concentrations above 10 μm were initially used for curve fitting.Rate=kmin+(kmax·[Sb(III)]n)/(K1/2n+[Sb(III)]n)Equation 2 where k min and k maxare the minimum and maximum rates of the conformational change induced by Sb(III) and n is the Hill coefficient. For phase 1, this fitting procedure indicated values for the Hill coefficient,K 12, k max, andk min of 4.0 ± 0.7, 45 ± 2 μm, 246 ± 14 s−1, and 29 ± 9 s−1, respectively (Fig. 3, top panel), whereas for phase 2, these constants had values of 3.7 ± 0.6, 44 ± 2 μm, 24 ± 1 s−1, and 4.8 ± 0.8 s−1, respectively (Fig. 3, bottom panel). The fact that the rates of both phase 1 and 2 are dependent upon the Sb(III) concentration suggests that ArsD has two nonidentical binding sites for Sb(III). Moreover, although the number of binding sites is not defined by the Hill coefficient, it does set a lower limit on the number of sites; there must be at least four interactive sites in functional ArsD to give a Hill coefficient of 4. The ArsD monomer has two binding sites for metalloids but forms dimers, and our data would be consistent with all of these sites interacting in a positive cooperative manner. Interestingly, for concentrations of Sb(III) below 10 μm, there was a deviation away from the best fit curves in Fig. 3 for phases 1 and 2, with the rates of these phases dropping off more rapidly than predicted. Accordingly, we reinvestigated this part of the titration curve, obtaining more data points between 0 and 50 μm Sb(III). As shown in Fig.4 (top panel), over this concentration range the rate of phase 1 increased in an apparently sigmoidal manner with the Sb(III) concentration and was best fitted to Equation 2 with values for the Hill coefficient,K 12, k max, andk min of 2.2 ± 0.4, 9.8 ± 1 μm, 67 ± 7 s−1, and 9.3 ± 2.0, s−1, respectively. Consistent with the data in Fig. 3, the rate increased more rapidly for concentrations above 40 μm. Phase 2 behaved in a parallel manner, indicating a Hill coefficient of 1.7 ± 0.3 (Fig. 4, middle panel). It is notable that this sigmoidal behavior occurs over the same concentration range as the steady-state titration curve for ArsD (Fig.1), and, although the corresponding amplitude data were more variable than the steady-state measurements, the concentration dependence of the amplitude data (e.g. total percentage of fluorescence change) was best fitted to a sigmoidal function with a Hill coefficient of 2.0 ± 0.5 and a ΔF max of 39 ± 1% (Fig. 4, bottom panel). It is tempting to speculate that phases 1 and 2 correspond to the filling of the two metalloid-binding sites (e.g.Cys12-Cys13 and Cys112-Cys113, respectively) within the monomer. However, as noted above, the concentration dependence of each phase is characterized by two sigmoidal dependences, at low (0–20 μm) and high (20–150 μm) concentrations of Sb(III). Moreover, for each phase, the increase in rate over the higher concentration range was characterized by a Hill coefficient of about 4, indicating that all four sites of dimeric ArsD are involved. On the other hand, the steady-state titration curve indicated that ArsD approaches saturation with Sb(III) at 20 μm, suggesting that the high affinity (detected by steady-state measurements) and the low affinity (detected by pre-steady-state measurements) ArsD-Sb(III) complexes are kinetically coupled; the latter is the initial ArsD-Sb(III) complex, and the former is the final ArsD-Sb(III) complex; these complexes are connected by a conformational change from one to the other. As illustrated by Fig.5, the titration curve for formation of the initial ArsD-Sb(III) complex, defined by the Sb(III) concentration dependence of the rate of binding of Sb(III) (e.g. either phase 1 or 2), is displaced to the right of the titration curve for the final ArsD-Sb(III) complex, defined by the Sb(III) concentration dependence of the steady-state fluorescence of ArsD, with half-saturation points for the initial and final complexes of about 44 and 1.7 μm, respectively. The simplest explanation for this behavior is that following the binding of Sb(III) to ArsD, the protein undergoes a conformational change that tightens the hold on Sb(III), probably in adopting a conformation that causes ArsD to dissociate from the arsRDABC promoter. Indeed, the equilibrium between these conformational states should be defined byk max and k min(e.g. forward and backward rate constants) determined for the binding of Sb(III) by the following relationship:K final = K initial/(1 +k max/k min), whereK initial and K final are the half-saturation constants for the initial and final ArsD-Sb(III) complexes, respectively. Applying this relationship, with the values determined for phase 1 for k max,k min, and K initial of 246 s−1, 29 s−1, and 44 μm, respectively, gave a calculated value for K finalof 4.6 μm. Although this value is slightly higher than the expected value of 1.7 μm, this difference could easily be accounted for by an additional conformational change that further tightens the binding. Indeed, we note that phase 2 is characterized by k max andk min values of 23.6 s−1 and 4.8 s−1, respectively, indicative of another conformational change that would yield a K final of 0.8 μm. There is still a remaining question as to what process is being measured at low Sb(III) concentrations (i.e. below 10 μm). Two possibilities are that 1) the measurements detect filling of the first two sites, which is necessary to “activate” ArsD so that it can undergo the conformational change to the final state or 2) a slow conformational change subsequent to formation of the initial ArsD-Sb(III) complex is being measured. The former scenario is more likely because this occurs with a Hill coefficient of 2, not 4, as would be expected for the latter scenario. Furthermore, the steady-state studies indicate that the fluorescence quench is largely attributable to the binding of metalloids to the Cys112-Cys113 site, and the measurements detect the filling of these sites within the dimer preferentially. The stopped flow traces for the binding of As(III) to ArsD were biphasic, but only the rate of the fast phase, which accounted for about 90% of the signal amplitude, was dependent upon the As(III) concentration (data not shown). The rate of this fast phase increased in a sigmoidal manner with the As(III) concentration, and a fit of the data to Equation 2 indicated values for the Hill coefficient,K 12, k max, andk min of 3.6 ± 0.8, 6.6 ± 0.5 mm, 8.7 ± 0.6 s−1, and 0.8 ± 0.4 s−1, respectively (Fig. 6). However, as noted for the binding of Sb(III) (Figs. 2 and 3), the first few data points deviated from the best fit sigmoidal curve. Thus, although a second concentration-dependent phase for As(III) was not observed, possibly because this is obscured by the lower signal amplitude, As(III) behaves in a manner similar to that of Sb(III). These data confirm the cooperative binding of metalloids by all four binding sites of dimeric ArsD but indicate that the conformational change from the initial to the final ArsD-As(III) complex occurs at a rate that is more than an order of magnitude slower than for Sb(III). Interestingly, there is a discrepancy between the calculated overallK 12 (i.e. K final= K initial/(1 +k max/k min) = 660 μm/(1 ± 8.7 s−1/0.8 s−1) = 54 μm) and that obtained from the steady-state titration curve (e.g. K 12 = 11.2 μm; Fig. 1); this is indicative of a further conformational change (i.e. the binding of As(III) to ArsD is at least a three-step process) that is rate-limiting. Dilution of the ArsD-Sb(III) complex with DTT to sequester the Sb(III) caused dissociation of the complex, as indicated by the increase in fluorescence of ArsD as the Sb(III) dissociated (Fig. 7), but no increase in protein fluorescence was observed when unliganded ArsD was mixed with DTT (data not shown). As expected, the ArsD-Sb(III) complex could not be dissociated by dilution with buffer in the stopped flow, because this only produced a drop in the Sb(III) concentration from 20 to 10 μm, which is still above the K 12; however, when 2 μm ArsD/5 μm Sb(III) was diluted 1:1 with buffer to drop the Sb(III) concentration below theK 1/2, the Sb(III) dissociated very slowly over several hours (data not shown). The stopped flow traces shown in Fig. 7 for the mixing of 1 μm ArsD/20 μmSb(III) with 0.5 mm DTT (trace A) and 5 mm DTT (trace B) were best fitted to biphasic exponential equation with rate constants of 20.0 ± 0.2 s−1 (86% of total signal amplitude) and 0.55 ± 0.02 s−1 (14% of total signal amplitude) for trace A and 166 ± 3 s−1 (90% of total signal amplitude) and 5.2 ± 0.2 s−1 (10% of total signal amplitude) for trace B. Both 0.5 and 5 mmDTT caused a 31–32% increase in fluorescence of ArsD-Sb(III). The rate constant for the fast phase increased linearly with the DTT concentration, indicating a second order rate constant of 36 ± 5 s−1 μm−1, whereas that for the slow phase had little concentration dependence, suggestive of a conformational change in ArsD subsequent to Sb(III) dissociation (Fig.8). Over the studied concentration range, of 0.1–5.0 mm DTT, the total signal amplitude was constant, indicating that all of the Sb(III), which could be sequestered by DTT, was displaced from the ArsD-Sb(III) complex. However, we note that the signal amplitude is slightly less than expected from the Sb(III)-induced quench in the ArsD fluorescence (e.g. 39% in stopped flow experiments), so that we cannot exclude the possibility that some Sb(III) remains bound to ArsD in the presence of DTT. The fact that the rate of DTT-induced dissociation of the ArsD-Sb(III) complex increases linearly with the DTT concentration is consistent with the dissociation process being rate limited by the collision or bimolecular association of DTT with the Sb(III)-ArsD complex. As discussed above, dissociation of Sb(III) from ArsD is too slow to be rate-limiting for this process, supporting our conclusion that Sb(III) is transferred directly from ArsD to bound DTT.Figure 8The concentration dependence of the DTT-induced dissociation of the ArsD-Sb(III) complex.

The membrane-proximal portion of the signaling domain, containing conserved box1 and box2 motifs, is sufficient to support the proliferation of cytokine-dependent cell lines and basal megakaryocytopoiesis in vivo. We hypothesized that activation of the JAK2 kinase alone might be sufficient for proliferative signaling. To test this premise, we constructed chimeric receptors in which the extracellular and transmembrane portions of Mpl were fused to the pseudokinase and kinase domains of murine JAK2 kinase. When expressed in the interleukin-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3, the chimeric receptors were appropriately expressed on the cell surface and were able to initiate tyrosine kinase activity upon exposure to TPO. However, chimeric receptors lacking an intact box2 domain of Mpl were unable to support proliferation at any concentration of TPO. Only chimeric receptors containing both JAK2 kinase activity and the box2 region initiated proliferative signaling. Within the box2 motif, we determined that the sequence Glu56-Ile57-Leu58 of the Mpl cytoplasmic domain is critical for proliferation of the chimeric receptors. Furthermore, TPO-dependent induction of c-myc transcription is also dependent on this motif. These results indicate that JAK2 activation alone is not sufficient for TPO-induced proliferation and that one or more essential signaling pathways must arise from the cytoplasmic domain of Mpl that includes box2. Although the nature of the signal transduction pathway is not yet known, this second proliferative event is likely to regulate c-myc expression.

Bioessays. 1999; 21: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Like other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily, Mpl does not contain endogenous tyrosine kinase activity, but instead regulates the activity of Janus kinases (JAKs). It has been widely reported that mutations or deletions of the Mpl box1 and box2 motifs abrogate JAK2 phosphorylation and also prevent TPO-induced proliferation (2Gurney A.L. Wong S.C.

Gisselbrecht S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5270-5274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, an engineered cell line that lacks JAK2 expression cannot support TPO signal transduction (8Drachman J.G. Millett K.M. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13480-13484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and fetal liver cells derived from jak2 nullizygous mouse embryos do not contain megakaryocyte progenitors or TPO-responsive cells (9Parganas E. Wang D. Stravopodis D. Topham D.J. Marine J.C. Teglund S. Vanin E.F. Bodner S. Colamonici O.R. van Deursen J.M. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Therefore, the bulk of the available data indicate that JAK2 activation is essential for normal TPO signaling. Our group (6Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and others (2Gurney A.L. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. de Sauvage F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the membrane-proximal portion of the Mpl signaling domain is sufficient for both JAK2 phosphorylation and proliferation, comparable to that seen with the wild-type receptor. This was confirmed in vivo by the recent report of experiments in which an altered Mpl receptor with only 61 membrane-proximal cytoplasmic residues was targeted to the native mpl locus; such homozygous mice display normal base-line megakaryocyte and platelet production (10Luoh S.M. Stefanich E. Solar G. Steinmetz H. Lipari T. Pestina T.I. Jackson C.W. de Sauvage F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All of the truncated Mpl receptors utilized in the previously reported studies include the box1 and box2 motifs, believed to be required for JAK docking to the receptor. The core of box1 contains two proline residues, separated by either one or two intervening amino acids, usually within the membrane-proximal 25 residues of the cytoplasmic domain (11Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). For Mpl, box1 includes the sequence Pro-Ser-Leu-Pro (residues 17–20) (7Benit L. Courtois G. Charon M. Varlet P. Dusanter-Fourt I. Gisselbrecht S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5270-5274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Box2 is less precisely conserved, but is usually recognized by its position (within residues 40–65 of the membrane-spanning domain) and by a cluster of acidic residues embedded in a hydrophobic region containing one or two basic residues at the carboxyl-terminal end (11Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In the Mpl receptor, box2 may include much of the region between cytoplasmic residues 45 and 60. At present, it is not known whether the membrane-proximal domain of Mpl fulfills any role other than the recruitment and activation of JAKs. Our previous studies (6Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and those of others (5Morita H. Tahara T. Matsumoto A. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Ohashi H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown a direct correlation between the level of JAK2 phosphorylation (activation) and the level to which cellular proliferation is supported. This finding led to the hypothesis that activation of JAK2 was not only necessary, but also sufficient for Mpl-directed proliferation. To test this hypothesis directly and to further explore the signaling requirements of Mpl, we constructed a series of chimeric Mpl/JAK2 receptors, replacing varying amounts of the Mpl signaling domain with the JAK2 pseudokinase and kinase domains. Previously published studies using the growth hormone receptor in COS cells demonstrated that this technique is feasible and that the fused JAK2 kinase domain is activated, as predicted, in a growth hormone-dependent manner (12Yi W. Kim S.O. Jiang J. Park S.H. Kraft A.S. Waxman D.J. Frank S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1425-1443PubMed Google Scholar). Using both the kinase (JH1) and pseudokinase (JH2) domains of murine JAK2, there should be less constitutive tyrosine kinase activity than was seen when only the kinase domain was used (12Yi W. Kim S.O. Jiang J. Park S.H. Kraft A.S. Waxman D.J. Frank S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1425-1443PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we found that a chimeric receptor containing 12 cytoplasmic residues of Mpl fused directly to the JH2 and JH1 domains of JAK2 (T12/JAK) was phosphorylated in a TPO-dependent manner, but was not able to support proliferation of Ba/F3 cells, even at high TPO concentrations. In a series of add-back constructs, we found that JAK2 fused after 28 cytoplasmic residues of Mpl (T28/JAK, including box1) was also incapable of proliferative signaling. By mutating critical residues of the box1 motif, we were able to inactivate forms of Mpl containing 53 and 69 cytoplasmic residues (T53/box1(φ) and T69/box1(φ), respectively). When JAK2 was fused to these truncated Mpl constructs, TPO-dependent proliferation was restored if all (T69/box1(φ)/JAK), but not part (T53/box1(φ)/JAK), of box2 was present, despite both chimeric receptors displaying JAK2 activity. Moreover, alanine substitution of only three amino acids in this region eliminated its function. This study establishes that, although JAK2 activation is necessary, it is not sufficient for proliferation of Ba/F3 cells and that one or more additional signaling events arise from the box2 subdomain. Finally, additional studies demonstrate that the same residues of box2 are essential for ligand-dependent c-myc induction. Because the box1/box2 organization of Mpl is similar to that of many other receptors, it is likely that our results reflect signal transduction mechanisms shared by other cytokine receptors. A wild-type murine mplcDNA (13Lok S. Kaushansky K. Holly R.D. Kuijper J.L. Lofton D.C.E. Oort P.J. Grant F.J. Heipel M.D. Burkhead S.K. Kramer J.M. Bell L.A. Sprecher C.A. Blumberg H. Johnson R.

Nature. 1994; 369: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) was cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3/Neo(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using EcoRI (5′) andXhoI (3′) as cloning sites. Carboxyl-terminal truncations (T53 and T69) were described previously (6Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The wild-type murinejak2 cDNA was generously provided by James Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) and Stuart Frank (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL). To make the chimeric jak2 constructs, a new XhoI site was created immediately downstream of the jak2 stop codon. Also, a unique ClaI site was generated in thejak2 cDNA immediately before amino acid 526 of the full-length protein, upstream of both the pseudokinase and kinase domains as utilized by previous studies (12Yi W. Kim S.O. Jiang J. Park S.H. Kraft A.S. Waxman D.J. Frank S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1425-1443PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a newClaI site was generated at the desired position of the c-mpl expression plasmid, and theClaI-XhoI fragment of jak2 (1812 bp, encoding 604 residues) was ligated into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3/Neo/mpl. The ClaI site resulted in the addition of two residues (Ile-Asp) at the fusion site betweenmpl and jak2. Mutations in the c-mplcoding region were introduced into the box1 (P17G/P20G) and box2 (E56A/I57A/L58A) motifs using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with oligonucleotides synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA). Similar methods were used to inactivate the JAK2 kinase by Y1007F mutation (14Feng J. Witthuhn B.A. Matsuda T. Kohlhuber F. Kerr I.M. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The mutated regions were sequenced to confirm polymerase fidelity (BigDye, PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Parental Ba/F3 cells were originally provided by Alan D'Andrea (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). These cells and all derived sublines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum,l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin (all from BioWhittaker, Inc.), and 0.2% conditioned medium containing murine interleukin-3 (mIL-3; approximate concentration of 1.5 ng/ml). Cells were transfected by electroporation of 3–5 μg of plasmid DNA mixed with 4 × 106 Ba/F3 cells in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (at 300 V and 800 microfarads and at 300 V and 1180 microfarads). After a 24-h incubation in standard growth medium containing mIL-3, the cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in growth medium with mIL-3 and 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma), and serially diluted into 96-well plates. After 7–10 days, clonal populations were chosen from an appropriate dilution (such that fewer than half of the wells contained viable cells), and the new cell lines were tested for Mpl expression by fluorescent immunostaining and Western blotting (see below). At least two clones expressing each construct were tested and maintained to assure that the results were internally consistent. Cells were maintained in IL-3 and G418 and were never exposed to TPO until the start of an experiment. This practice decreases the chance of inadvertently selecting cells that spontaneously express the wild-type Mpl receptor. All cell lines were tested by fluorescent antibody labeling to confirm that a uniform population of Mpl-expressing cells was present and that approximately equal levels of Mpl were expressed on different cell lines. Cells were first labeled with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against the extracytoplasmic portion of Mpl (generously provided by Zymogenetics, Inc., Seattle, WA). The antiserum (final dilution of 1:1000) was allowed to bind for 45 min at 4 °C. After washing, the secondary antibody was added (phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG; Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min. The cells were again washed and analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD PharMingen) to detect fluorescence intensity. Parental Ba/F3 cells were used as a negative control. Proliferation assays were performed as previously described (6Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in log-phase growth were washed three times to remove any traces of IL-3 and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics (no growth factor). Cells were aliquoted into a 96-well tissue culture plate (50 μl/well, 5,000–10,000 cells) using a multichannel pipettor, and an equal volume of medium containing serial 10-fold dilutions of recombinant murine TPO derived from conditioned supernatant or in purified form (10 pg/ml to 1000 ng/ml; Kirin Corp., Gunma, Japan) was added. After 36 h of incubation, MTT reagent (1 mg/ml final concentration; Sigma) was added to each well, and the plates were returned to the incubator for 5 h. Cells were lysed, and formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 100 μl of MTT lysis buffer to each well. Absorbance values (570–630 nm) were recorded on triplicate samples using a Bio-Rad plate reader; experiments were performed multiple times with more than one clone for each chimeric or mutant Mpl construct. Data are expressed as a percentage of maximum proliferation, determined separately for each cell line using an optimal concentration of mIL-3 (∼15 ng/ml). Cells were grown in mIL-3 to a final concentration of 5–8 × 105/ml. After washing twice to remove all mIL-3 and serum, the cells were resuspended at a final concentration of 2 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 6–12 h. Equal volumes of cells were then either unstimulated or exposed to TPO (6.7 ng/ml as conditioned tissue culture medium) for 10 min. After washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were resuspended at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and inhibitors of proteases and tyrosine phosphatases as previously described (6Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using a modified Lowry assay (Protein D/C, Bio-Rad), and aliquots were frozen (−80 °C) until used. All immunoprecipitations were performed with 1 mg of total protein starting material as previously described (6Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 15Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal rabbit antisera specific for Mpl (2 μl/reaction; Zymogenetics, Inc.) and JAK2 (2 μl/reaction; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Immune complexes were collected by adding 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as previously described (8Drachman J.G. Millett K.M. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13480-13484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were analyzed on 7.5 or 4–20% denaturing acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with primary antibody (anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 at 1:2000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:3000; Bio-Rad). Chemiluminescent reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to x-ray film were used to visualize phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. Blots were then stripped of antibody and reprobed with the same antibody used for immunoprecipitation and horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) to demonstrate equal amounts of starting protein (8Drachman J.G. Millett K.M. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13480-13484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ba/F3 cells expressing truncated and mutant Mpl receptors were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and IL-3 while growing in log phase. Cells were then washed extensively to remove growth factor and allowed to incubate in serum- and cytokine-free medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 14–16 h. Recombinant murine TPO was added (10 ng/ml), and aliquots were withdrawn at 0, 1, and 3 h. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy minikit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA); the concentration was determine by spectrophotometry; and the quality was assessed on agarose gel. One microgram of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using oligo(dT) (41.7 ng/ml; Invitrogen) and Superscript II (Invitrogen.) according to the manufacturer's directions. One-tenth of the reaction was subsequently removed for PCR with either c-myc oligonucleotides (primers: 5′-CCCACTCTCCCCAACCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTCTCCTCCAAGTAACTCG-3′ (antisense); predicted product of 607 bp) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase oligonucleotides (primers: 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′ (antisense); predicted product of 194 bp). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide. The gel was photographed with a Polaroid camera on a UV transilluminator. Two Ba/F3 cell lines expressing chimeric T69/box1(φ)/box2(AAA)/JAK receptors were transduced with the retroviral construct MycER-GFP (kindly provided by Ronald Cheung). This construct combines tamoxifen-inducible MycERTM (from Trevor Littlewood) in a vector containing an internal ribosomal entry site followed by the cDNA for GFP (kindly provided by Garry Nolan, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). Control cell lines were created using a similar construct encoding a nonfunctional form of c-myc (ΔMycER-GFP). To assess the effect of c-myc induction on TPO-dependent cell cycling, T69/box1(φ)/box2(AAA)/JAK cell lines expressing MycER-GFP or ΔMycER-GFP were starved of serum and growth factor for 6 h and then stimulated with either TPO or IL-3 in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma) or an equivalent amount of vehicle (ethanol) for 16 h. Cellular DNA was stained with Hoechst dye 33342 (Sigma), and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. For each sample, the gate was set to include only cells expressing GFP, and then cell cycle histograms based on DNA content were constructed. The percentage of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle was determined by manual gating. The receptors utilized in this study are illustrated in Fig.1 A. For all constructs, the wild-type extracytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of Mpl were intact. Carboxyl-terminal truncations of the signaling domain are denoted by “T” followed by the number of remaining membrane-proximal amino acids (e.g. in the T69 receptor, cytoplasmic residues 70–121 were deleted, and only amino acids 1–69 remain). Chimeric receptors containing the JH1 and JH2 domains of JAK2 are indicated by the suffix “JAK.” A double mutation in box1 that prevents activation of endogenous JAK2 (i.e. P17G/P20G) is indicated as “box1(φ),” and a triple alanine substitution in box2 (E56A/I57A/L58A) is indicated as “box2(AAA).” Chimeric receptors in which the kinase domain of JAK2 is inactivated by a Tyr-to-Phe substitution at position 1007 of JAK2 are denoted as “JAK(Y1007F).” As shown, Ba/F3 sublines expressing wild-type Mpl, T69, T12/JAK, T28/JAK, T69/box1(φ), T69/JAK, T69/box1(φ)/JAK, T69/box1(φ)/box2(AAA)/JAK, and T69/box1(φ)/JAK(Y1007F) were generated with approximately the same level of cell-surface receptor expression (Fig. 1 B). For each construct, two or more clones were studied to assure that results were internally consistent. The importance of box1 for cytokine receptor signaling has been well documented, especially the characteristically spaced proline residues within the first 15–25 cytoplasmic residues (7Benit L. Courtois G. Charon M. Varlet P. Dusanter-Fourt I. Gisselbrecht S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5270-5274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). To confirm the role of box1 in a truncated Mpl receptor containing 69 cytoplasmic residues, we mutated the two proline residues in the Mpl box1 motif to glycine (P17G/P20G). As predicted, the resulting T69/box1(φ) receptor was completely deficient in both TPO-dependent proliferation (Fig.2 A) and phosphorylation of endogenous JAK2 (Fig. 2 B). The same results were obtained using a T53/box1(φ) receptor (data not shown). These data confirm that box1 provides a critical signal for cellular proliferation and is necessary for JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in the T69 truncated Mpl receptor. From our studies of truncated Mpl receptors, we know that there is a major decrease in TPO-dependent proliferation when residues 53–69 are deleted from the cytoplasmic domain (6Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Further truncation of residues 28–53 eliminates the residual proliferative response. By mutating amino acids between cytoplasmic positions 53 and 69 to alanine, we were able to measure the effect on receptor function. The greatest effect on proliferation of Ba/F3 cells was observed when three residues (Glu56-Ile57-Leu58) were substituted with alanines, creating a box2 mutant designated T69/box2(AAA) (Fig. 3 A). By itself, this mutation diminished (but did not eliminate) tyrosine phosphorylation of the native JAK2 kinase (Fig. 3 B). Based on our previous observation that the level of JAK2 phosphorylation and proliferation appears to be directly correlated (6Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that phosphorylation (i.e. activation) of JAK2 alone would be sufficient for proliferative signaling. Previous studies with the erythropoietin and epidermal growth factor receptors fused to the JAK2 kinase domain suggested that this might also hold for Mpl (16Joneja B. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11176-11184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Nakamura N. Chin H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19483-19488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially designed a chimeric Mpl/JAK2 receptor that included only 12 cytoplasmic residues from Mpl plus the JAK2 JH1 (kinase) and JH2 (pseudokinase) domains (T12/JAK). After verifying that the receptor was adequately expressed on the cell surface of Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 1 B), distinct clones were tested for TPO-induced proliferation by MTT assay (Fig.4 A). Contrary to expectation, we found that the chimeric receptor was unable to support proliferation, even at high TPO concentrations. We then constructed a receptor containing 28 membrane-proximal cytoplasmic residues of Mpl including the entire box1 motif (T28/JAK). Again, despite high level receptor expression (Fig. 1 B), the chimeric receptor failed to support BaF3 cellular proliferation in TPO (Fig. 4 A). These experiments suggest that, in addition to phosphorylation of the fused JAK2 domain, a portion of the Mpl cytoplasmic domain distal to residue 28 may be required for cellular proliferation. Our previous studies showed that a truncated Mpl receptor containing the first 53 cytoplasmic residues (T53) retains limited ability to activate endogenous JAK2 and to support proliferation, whereas a receptor with 69 cytoplasmic residues (T69) is nearly fully active (6Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To test the role of Mpl residues 1–53 and 1–69 in supporting proliferation in a chimeric Mpl/JAK2 construct, we first mutated box1 (P17G/P20G) to eliminate any effect of endogenous JAK2 (Fig. 2). The resulting receptors (T53/box1(φ)/JAK and T69/box1(φ)/JAK) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells and tested for their ability to support proliferation in TPO-containing cultures. Our results demonstrate that the T53/box1(φ)/JAK construct could not support growth, but that cells expressing the T69/box1(φ)/JAK receptor displayed a significant degree of TPO-dependent proliferation (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that Mpl cytoplasmic domain residues Leu54–Leu69 are necessary for proliferation of the chimeric Mpl/JAK2 receptor. Although these 16 amino acids may function to properly orient the distal JAK2 kinase domain, it is also possible that this subdomain, which includes the box2 core motif, provides docking sites for additional signaling molecules and activates distinct proliferative pathways. Despite the fact that the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 (JH2, ∼300 amino acids) acts as a large spacer between the Mpl cytoplasmic domain and the JAK2 kinase domain, it is theoretically possible that T69/box1(φ)/JAK supports proliferation because of a favorable orientation of the fused JAK2 kinase compared with its orientation in T53/box1(φ)/JAK, allowing interaction with signaling molecules docked on the Mpl cytoplasmic residues. Because the box2 core sequence Glu56-Ile57-Leu58 is critical for proliferation (Fig. 3 A), we engineered the triple alanine substitution in T69/box1(φ)/JAK, creating the T69/box1(φ)/box2(AAA)/JAK receptor with no change in the number of residues acting as a spacer between Mpl and the JAK kinase domain. This mutation completely eliminated TPO responsiveness of the chimeric receptor (Fig. 4 C), verifying the importance of the box2 motif for proliferation. It is also possible that the T69/box1(φ)/JAK receptor acts by recruiting end"

Similar to CD95 ligand (CD95L), TRAIL signaling requires ligand-receptor interaction; the downstream signaling molecules, such as Fas-associated death domain and caspase-8, also seem similar. Using cells stably expressing TRAIL and CD95L, we show that both TRAIL and CD95L induce apoptosis in the rat colon carcinoma cell line CC531. The mitochondrial damage (loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and release of cytochrome c) observed after co-incubation with TRAIL-expressing cells occurs much earlier than that observed with CD95L-expressing cells. The decrease in MMP induced by both ligands was caspase-8-mediated; no difference in caspase-8 activation by TRAIL and CD95L was found. TRAIL, but not CD95L, induced activation of caspase-10. bcl-2 overexpression could not prevent TRAIL-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, whereas it completely prevented CD95L-mediated loss of MMP and cytochromec release. The selective effect of TRAIL on tumor cells and the apparent inability of bcl-2 to block TRAIL-induced apoptosis suggest that TRAIL may offer a lead for cancer therapy in the future.

Hepatology. 1999; 29: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Okamura H. Kashiwamura S. Tsutsui H. Yoshimoto T. Nakanishi K. Curr. Opin.

Therefore, TRAIL seems more suitable for therapeutic strategies directed against tumor cells than CD95L. CD95L and TRAIL bind to different receptors on the plasma membrane of target cells. CD95L binds to CD95, which via the adapter molecule Fas-associated death domain activates caspase-8 (17Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5386-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), which are also coupled to caspase-8 (and possibly caspase-10) (22Kuang A.A. Diehl G.E. Zhang J. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25065-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar); alternatively, it can bind to the decoy receptors DcR1 (23Degli-Esposti M.A. Smolak P.J. Walczak H.

The reason for the striking difference in toxicity after in vivo application could be a difference in expression of the receptors for both ligands by tumor cells as compared with nontransformed cells and/or a different intracellular signaling route after binding to the receptor. It has been described that depending on the cell type, binding of CD95L can activate two routes downstream of caspase-8 activation: type I apoptosis signaling (direct activation of effector caspases by caspase-8 (18Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5085) Google Scholar)) and type II apoptosis (cleavage of proapoptotic members of the bcl-2 family, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (25Vander H.M.

Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar)). The routes downstream of TRAIL binding are less well known. Thomas et al. (30Thomas W.D. Zhang X.D. Franco A.V. Nguyen T. Hersey P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5612-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) noted that TRAIL induces a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in human melanoma cells, whereas CD95L had no effect on the ΔΨm in these cells. Apparently, TRAIL induces type II apoptosis. A similar finding was reported by Kim et al.(10Kim E.J. Suliman A. Lam A. Srivastava R.K. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar) using Jurkat, U937, and MCF-7 cells. If TRAIL predominantly induces type II apoptosis, it can be expected to be inhibited by bcl-2 overexpression. However, reports are conflicting. Thomas et al. (30Thomas W.D. Zhang X.D. Franco A.V. Nguyen T. Hersey P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5612-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) reported total protection against TRAIL-induced apoptosis, whereas Kim et al. (10Kim E.J. Suliman A. Lam A. Srivastava R.K. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar) found that overexpression of bcl-2 delayed but did not block apoptosis. A systematic comparison of the intracellular routes after CD95L or TRAIL signaling has, to our knowledge, never been published. Because the reason for the difference in in vivo application could also be due to intracellular differences, we performed the present study, using CC531 cells as targets; this cell type expresses CD95 and all four TRAIL receptors. Rather than using recombinant proteins, we used 2PK3 cells stably expressing either CD95L or TRAIL to induce apoptosis because it was reported that membrane-expressed CD95L was more efficient (31Medema J.P. de Jong J. van Hall T. Melief C.J. Offringa R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We show that TRAIL causes a much more potent dysfunction of the mitochondria than CD95L, whereas the extent of apoptosis was comparable. This suggests that CD95L mainly caused type I apoptosis, whereas TRAIL induced type II apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase-8 was sufficient to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction in both cases. We found a striking difference of overexpression of bcl-2 on apoptosis induction by TRAIL and CD95L: bcl-2 could not prevent TRAIL-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, whereas it completely blocked the effect of CD95L. Also, in the bcl-2-overexpressing cells, mitochondrial dysfunction was a caspase-8-mediated effect. We conclude that TRAIL and CD95L signaling trigger distinct intracellular routes in CC531 cells. The caspase inhibitors zVAD-fmk, Ac-DEVD-CHO, and Ac-IEPD-CHO were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands) supplied calcein-AM, and propidium iodide was purchased from Sigma. Annexin V was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and labeled with allophycocyanin, a 652 nm fluorescent probe (Prozyme). Anti-CD95, anti-DR4, and anti-bcl-2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-DR5 was obtained from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada), and anti-DcR1 and anti-DcR2 were obtained from Prosci Inc. (San Diego, CA). The antibody against cytochrome c was purchased from BD PharMingen. Dr. J. Borst (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) kindly provided antibodies against FLIP and caspase-8. All horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). CC531 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 “Dutch modification” medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 4 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). The bcl-2 transfectants, a gift from Rob Hoetelmans (Department of Surgery, LUMC, Leiden, The Netherlands) were cultured as described previously (32Hoetelmans R. van Slooten H.J. Keijzer R. Erkeland S. van de Velde C.J. Dierendonck J.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mouse B-cell lymphoma 2PK3-mock, 2PK3-CD95L, and 2PK3-mTRAIL cells (a kind gift from Hideo Yagita; Tokyo, Japan) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (l-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. CC531 cells and 2PK3 cells were harvested and washed twice. The CC531 cells were labeled by incubation with 1 μm calcein-AM for 15 min in culture medium. Subsequently, these cells were washed and seeded in a 96-well U-bottomed plate at a density of 1 × 105cells/50 μl/well. One million 2PK3 cells were added in a volume of 100 μl. After the indicated time period, the 96-well plate was centrifuged for 3 min at 1500 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, the cells were washed with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and the detached cells were transferred to a clean plate. Next, the original plate was trypsinized for 10 min at 37 °C, and the cells were added to the phosphate-buffered saline fraction. The plate was centrifuged again for 3 min at 500 × g at 4 °C. The cells were suspended in 200 μl of binding buffer (BB) containing 0.5 μl of annexin V (0.5 μg/μl) for flow cytometric analysis. The BB consisted of 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.0 mmMgCl2·6H2O, and 1.8 mmCaCl2·2H2O in Milli Q water, pH 7.4. Flow cytometric analysis after co-incubation was performed as described. 2J. H. L. Velthuis, H. J. G. M. de Bont, J. P. Medema, P. J. K. Kuppen, G. J. Mulder, and J. F. Nagelkerke, submitted for publication.Briefly, cells were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min in annexin V-containing BB and washed twice with 200 μl of BB. Next, the cells were taken up in 200 μl of BB, and 10 μl of 100 μmpropidium iodide (PI) was added shortly before measurement. Samples were analyzed on the FACScalibur (BD PharMingen). Target cells were selected by gating the calcein-AM-positive cells. Viable cell are annexin V-allophycocyanin- and PI-negative, apoptotic cells are annexin-positive and PI-negative, and necrotic cells are annexin- and PI-positive. Cells were lysed in TSE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with IgG as a standard. Twenty μg of total cellular protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4) and probed with the primary antibody. Next, blots were incubated with secondary antibody containing horseradish peroxidase and visualized with ECL reagent (AmershamBiosciences). To determine the mitochondrial membrane potential of CC531 cells during co-incubation with 2PK3 cells, 3 × 105 CC531 cells were plated on a coverglass (Knittel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) and cultured overnight at 37 °C in culture medium. The following day, these CC531 cells were loaded with 5 μmrhodamine-123 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 20 min. During the loading of the CC531s cells, the effector cells were harvested, counted, and briefly incubated with 0.2 μm rhodamine-123. The excess rhodamine was removed from the CC531 cells, and 2PK3 cells (3 × 106) were added while the coverglass was constantly kept at 37 °C under a confocal laser scanning microscope. During a 3-h time course, images of rhodamine-123 fluorescence were made every 2 min. Analysis was done by selecting a single cell and making a plot of pixel intensity versus the number of pixels. Herein, the mitochondria have a much higher intensity than the background. By selecting a minimal intensity, the mitochondria were separated from the background. Next, the mean pixel intensity and the number of pixels of the mitochondria were calculated and multiplied. These values are plotted as the percentage of the initial total pixel intensityversus time (min). At least five cells were selected and quantified per experiment. CC531 cells were plated on a coverglass and allowed to attach overnight. The following day, they were co-incubated with effector cells for the indicated period. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% EDTA, thereby removing the effector cells but not affecting the target cells. Attached cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and proven to be >95% CC531 cells (data not shown). After separation of the two cell types, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from CC531 cells as described previously (33Juin P. Hueber A.O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and the fractions were immunoblotted for cytochrome c. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's two-sample equal variance two-tailed ttest. A prerequisite for comparing the intracellular routes leading to apoptosis after TRAIL or CD95L exposure is the presence of CD95 and all four TRAIL receptors on the target cell. Therefore, the expression of the receptors was determined on CC531s, the rat colon carcinoma cell line that we found to be sensitive toward both ligands. Immunoblots stained for CD95 and all TRAIL receptors clearly show that all receptors were present (Fig.1). There seemed to be slightly more DR5 than DR4 at the protein level. The same was true for DcR2 as compared with DcR1. Thus, CD95 and the four TRAIL receptors were present in the CC531s cell line which made it a suitable target cell to investigate TRAIL and CD95L signaling. To study the effect of TRAIL and CD95L signaling, we used 2PK3 cells that had been transfected with either mTRAIL or mCD95L as effector cells, and 2PK3-mock cells served as control (34Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N. Nakayama M. Takeda K. Akiba H. Tsutsui H. Okamura H. Nakanishi K. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1906-1913PubMed Google Scholar). This provided us with a tool to compare TRAIL to CD95L using the same effector and target cell line. First, we determined TRAIL- and CD95L-induced apoptosis in CC531s cells. The cells were co-incubated with effector cells at an effector:target ratio of 10 for 3 h. Subsequently, the calcein-AM-labeled CC531s cells were stained with annexin V and PI. Using flow cytometry, cells positive for annexin V-allophycocyanin but negative for PI were identified as apoptotic. As shown in Fig.2, 32% of the CC531s cells showed apoptotic features after co-incubation with 2PK3-mTRAIL cells, whereas co-incubation with the mock-transfected 2PK3 cell line caused no apoptosis. 2PK3-mCD95L cells as effectors resulted in 36% apoptotic CC531s cells. The importance of caspase-8 and -3 has been described extensively for apoptosis induced by CD95L and to a lesser extent for that induced by TRAIL. Thus, we assessed the role of upstream caspase-8 and -10 as well as downstream caspase-3 by preincubation of the CC531s cells with caspase inhibitors before the addition of the 2PK3 cells. Inhibition of caspase-8 by Ac-IEPD-CHO, inhibition of caspase-3 by Ac-DEVD-CHO, or inhibition of all caspases by zVAD-fmk completely prevented CD95L-induced apoptosis (Fig.3 A). In TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, inhibition of caspase-8 reduced the level of apoptotic CC531s cells from 33% to 15% (Fig. 2 B). Addition of zVAD-fmk as well as the combined addition of Ac-IEPD-CHO and the caspase-10 inhibitor z-AEVD-fmk (indicated as I + A) completely prevented apoptosis. The inhibitory effect of Ac-DEVD-CHO was very similar to single addition of Ac-IEPD-CHO (the level of apoptotic cells was reduced from 33% to 15%). Addition of zAEVD-fmk only slightly reduced apoptosis by TRAIL. Both TRAIL and CD95L caused a comparable level of apoptosis in CC531s cells. To find out whether the intracellular signaling pathways involved were the same, we examined whether CD95L and TRAIL signaling caused mitochondrial dysfunction. First, the effect of 2PK3-mTRAIL and 2PK3-mCD95L on the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in CC531s cells was studied. Mitochondria of CC531s cells were loaded with rhodamine-123 to quantify ΔΨm (35van de Water B. Zoetewey J.P. de Bont H.J. Mulder G.J. Nagelkerke J.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) before the addition of the 2PK3-mTRAIL or 2PK3-mCD95L cells. Subsequently, cells were monitored for 3 h using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Co-incubation with 2PK3-mTRAIL cells rapidly decreased the ΔΨm of CC531s cells: after 60 min, the maximum rhodamine-123 release was almost complete (Fig.4). Co-incubation with the 2PK3-mCD95L cell line also decreased ΔΨm, but maximum rhodamine-123 release was not seen until ∼2 h after the start of the co-incubation. The addition of 2PK3-mock cells induced no other than a spontaneous release of rhodamine-123. Because both ligands induced loss of ΔΨm, the release of cytochromec needed for the formation of the apoptosome and activation of caspase-9 was studied. After co-incubation, the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of CC531s cells were immunoblotted for cytochromec. After just 15 min of 2PK3-mTRAIL exposure, cytochromec appeared in the cytosolic fraction of the CC531s cells (Fig. 5), and the concentration increased with time. Consequently, in mitochondria, cytochrome cdecreased with longer incubation periods. In contrast, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was much slower after incubation with 2PK3-mCD95L cells. Release of cytochrome cwas only fully detectable after 120 min of exposure to the effector cells. No cytosolic cytochrome c was detected after co-incubation with the mock-transfected 2PK3 cells. Both TRAIL and CD95L cause mitochondrial dysfunction, although to a different extent. In the effect of both agents, an important role for caspase-8 was observed (Fig. 3); caspase-8 is capable of cleaving proapoptotic members of the bcl-2 family as well as directly activating caspase-3, which, in its turn, can cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, we studied the effects on ΔΨm in the presence of caspase inhibitors. The effect of 2PK3-mTRAIL cells could be fully prevented by addition of the caspase-8 inhibitor Ac-IEPD-CHO and the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, the presence of the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO had no effect on the loss of ΔΨm, indicating that loss of ΔΨm was downstream of caspase-8 but upstream of caspase-3. Addition of the caspase-10 inhibitor z-AEVD-fmk had no effect on the loss of ΔΨm (data not shown). Like TRAIL, CD95L-induced mitochondrial dysfunction was prevented by the addition of Ac-IEPD-CHO and zVAD-fmk (Fig.6 B). Again, inhibition of caspase-3 could not prevent the loss of ΔΨm. Therefore, CD95L-mediated loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was also a caspase-8 mediated phenomenon. One possible explanation for the much more rapid decrease of ΔΨm after TRAIL in comparison with CD95L might be a more efficient activation of caspase-8. Therefore, CC531s cells were exposed to the effector cells for the indicated periods, lysed, and immunoblotted for active caspase-8. No difference was observed between TRAIL- and CD95L-induced activation of caspase-8 (Fig.7 A). Also, densitometrical analysis of the immunoblot revealed no difference (Fig.7 B). Because TRAIL signaling in CC531s cells caused such a strong decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, the effect of overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 in a stably transfected CC531-bcl-2 cell line (32Hoetelmans R. van Slooten H.J. Keijzer R. Erkeland S. van de Velde C.J. Dierendonck J.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was examined. To confirm that bcl-2 transfection did not affect receptor expression or the level of FLIP (an inhibitor of Fas-associated death domain caspase-8 signaling), CC531s and CC531-bcl-2 cells were checked for the presence of the four receptors for TRAIL as well as CD95; the level of endogenous FLIP and bcl-2 in the CC531s and CC531-bcl-2 cells was compared by immunoblotting (Fig. 8,S, CC531s cells; bcl-2, CC531-bcl-2 cells). Clearly, the expression of the death receptors and the levels of FLIP were comparable. Apparently, the difference between the two cell lines was due only to the overexpression of bcl-2 (Fig. 8,Bcl-2). Next we examined the effect of overexpression of bcl-2 in CC531 cells on TRAIL- and CD95L-mediated apoptosis (Fig.9). TRAIL-induced apoptosis was decreased (22% versus 32% in CC531s cells) but not prevented. The same was seen for CD95L-mediated cell death (which decreased from 36% to 28%). Therefore, bcl-2 overexpression reduced but could not prevent apoptosis initiated by either of the two ligands. Because bcl-2 can protect mitochondrial dysfunction after various stimuli, and TRAIL caused mainly type II apoptosis, we had expected a more pronounced effect of bcl-2 overexpression on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we examined the mitochondrial membrane potential of CC531-bcl-2 cells after exposure to 2PK3-mTRAIL and 2PK3-mCD95L cells. bcl-2 overexpression slightly delayed TRAIL-induced loss of ΔΨm, but after 70 min, no difference between CC531s and CC531-bcl-2 cells was detected any more (Fig.10 A). In contrast, bcl-2 overexpression completely prevented CD95L-induced loss of ΔΨm in these cells (Fig. 10 B). Because loss of ΔΨm in CC531-bcl-2 cells after TRAIL signaling was little affected, the release of cytochrome c from bcl-2-overexpressing cells was compared with that from CC531s cells. Similar to the loss of ΔΨm, release of cytochrome c was hardly affected by bcl-2 overexpression after TRAIL signaling (Fig.11 A). In contrast, similar to the loss of ΔΨm, bcl-2 overexpression prevented the release of cytochrome c after CD95L signaling (Fig.11 B). Finally, the involvement of caspases in TRAIL-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction was studied in the CC531-bcl-2 cell line. As with standard CC531 cells, the presence of Ac-IEPD-CHO or zVAD-fmk was sufficient to prevent the loss of ΔΨm, whereas Ac-DEVD-CHO had no protective effect. Thus, in CC531-bcl-2 cells, mitochondrial dysfunction was also downstream of caspase-8 but upstream of caspase-3 (Fig.12). Both TRAIL and CD95L seemed equally potent in inducing apoptosis in CC531s cells: co-incubation with 2PK3-mTRAIL or 2PK3-mCD95L cells resulted in 32% and 36% apoptotic cells, respectively. Inhibition of caspase-8 was sufficient to abolish CD95L-induced apoptosis, whereas TRAIL-mediated apoptosis was largely dependent on caspase-8, but a role for caspase-10 remained: an additional inhibition from 15% to 9% was seen. Also, inhibition of the effector caspases-3 and -7 by Ac-DEVD-CHO prevented CD95L-initiated apoptosis but only reduced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. zVAD-fmk could completely prevent apoptosis by both ligands. These results were similar to the observations by Seol et al. (36Seol D.W., Li, J. Seol M.H. Park S.Y. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1138-1143PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that addition of z-DEVD-fmk was not sufficient to restore cell viability in the presence of TRAIL. In contrast, Kim et al. (10Kim E.J. Suliman A. Lam A. Srivastava R.K. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar) reported that z-DEVD-fmk prevented TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Kim et al. (10Kim E.J. Suliman A. Lam A. Srivastava R.K. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar) used Jurkat cells, whereas Seol et al. (36Seol D.W., Li, J. Seol M.H. Park S.Y. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1138-1143PubMed Google Scholar) used HeLa cells. In this respect, CC531s cells resemble HeLa cells. Furthermore, TRAIL caused such a potent disruption of the mitochondria (Fig. 4) that inhibition of the effector caspases-3 and -7 may simply be insufficient to prevent apoptosis because many mitochondrial factors are already released into the cytosol. The much earlier occurring mitochondrial dysfunction caused by TRAIL as well as that of CD95L could be prevented by Ac-IEPD-CHO and was therefore a caspase-8-mediated effect. However, the difference in potency in mitochondrial dysfunction between TRAIL and CD95L could not be explained by a more efficient activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 7). Furthermore, overexpression of bcl-2 only slightly delayed the loss of ΔΨm in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis as compared with CC531s cells, whereas no difference was found in release of cytochrome c. Possibly, a mitochondrial membrane-disrupting protein is activated by TRAIL signaling that is not inhibited by bcl-2. Apparently this disrupting protein is not activated by CD95L signaling. These results support the previous observations by Kim et al.(10Kim E.J. Suliman A. Lam A. Srivastava R.K. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar), who, after 16 h, no longer saw a difference between bcl-2-transfected and neo-Jurkat cells in retention of the mitochondrial dye DiOC6. Our results showed a significant difference between the standard CC531s cell line and the bcl-2-transfected cell line up to 1 h after the start of the co-incubation, but not after that time point. Moreover, Keogh et al. (37Keogh S.A. Walczak H. Bouchier-Hayes L. Martin S.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) showed that bcl-2 overexpression completely blocked UV-induced cytochrome c release but failed to do so after TRAIL signaling. In contrast, both Rokhlin et al. (38Rokhlin O.W. Guseva N. Tagiyev A. Knudson C.M. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and Munshi et al. (39Munshi A. Pappas G. Honda T. McDonnell T.J. Younes A., Li, Y. Meyn R.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3757-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) reported that bcl-2 overexpression in human prostate carcinoma cell lines protected them against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Rokhlin et al. (38Rokhlin O.W. Guseva N. Tagiyev A. Knudson C.M. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) also reported that bcl-2 overexpression abrogated the loss of ΔΨm and the release of cytochrome c. One possible explanation might be the lack of the suggested TRAIL-activated mitochondrial disrupting protein in human prostate cancers. Although TRAIL-induced apoptosis is strongly dependent on the mitochondrial route, it has been shown that some effects of TRAIL are mediated by direct activation of caspase-3 by upstream caspase-8 (40Srivastava R.K. Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, TRAIL can induce apoptosis in a mitochondria-dependent and -independent manner (41Suliman A. Lam A. Datta R. Srivastava R.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2122-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), although the mitochondrial amplification loop plays an important role. Again, this is in contrast with the findings of Rokhlin et al. (38Rokhlin O.W. Guseva N. Tagiyev A. Knudson C.M. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and Munshi et al. (39Munshi A. Pappas G. Honda T. McDonnell T.J. Younes A., Li, Y. Meyn R.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3757-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) because they reported the absence of apoptosis in bcl-2-overexpressing prostate carcinoma cells, suggesting a lack of TRAIL-induced type I apoptosis in this cell type. Thus, TRAIL could be effective as a possible future treatment for several cancers (40Srivastava R.K. Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) such as lymphoid and colon tumors, whereas for prostate cancer, it may prove to be an ineffective antitumor agent. In CC531-bcl-2 cells, the loss of ΔΨm could be inhibited by the addition of Ac-IEPD-CHO. Thus caspase-8 was also responsible for the mitochondrial dysfunction in these cells. Furthermore, no delay in release of cytochrome c in CC531-bcl-2 cells as compared with CC531s cells was detected. In comparison, CD95L-induced cytochromec release was prevented by bcl-2 overexpression, concordant with prevention of the loss of ΔΨm (Fig. 10 B). Taken together, the much more potent disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential by TRAIL as compared with CD95L and the release of cytochrome c, both of which were hardly inhibitable by bcl-2 overexpression but in all cases were caspase-8-mediated, indicate distinct intracellular signaling in TRAIL- and CD95L-mediated apoptosis."

Among the mechanisms that modulate the activity of the E2F proteins, cyclin A has been found to be important for the down-regulation of E2F-1, -2, and -3A activity after cells have progressed through G1/S. Specifically, phosphorylation of these E2F proteins by cyclin A/Cdk2 ultimately results in their necessary degradation as cells progress through S phase. E2F-3B was recently identified as an alternatively spliced form of E2F-3A that was predicted to lack a functional cyclin A binding domain. In this paper, we present considerable evidence that contradicts this prediction. First, we demonstrate binding of cyclin A to E2F-3B as bacterially expressed proteins in vitro. Second, we demonstrate binding of cyclin A to E2F-3B in mammalian cellsin vivo. Third, we show that co-expression of cyclin A with E2F-3B significantly reduces E2F-3B-mediated transcriptional activity. Finally, in synchronized cells, we observe down-regulation of E2F-3B protein expression coincident with the up-regulation of cyclin A. We conclude that E2F-3B is a physiological target of cyclin A.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Specifically, the E2F family controls the expression of genes required for DNA synthesis at the G1/S phase boundary (4Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E.

The first group includes E2F-1, -2, and -3A. These factors represent the growth stimulatory segment of the family, since they are potent transcriptional activators and are required for the entrance of cells into S phase (8Humbert P.O. Verona R.

Structural characteristics of this group include an extended N-terminal region of unknown function, a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and overlapping the NLS, a cyclin A binding domain (17Magae J., Wu, C.L.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 229-236PubMed Google Scholar). The second group includes E2F-4, -5, and -6, which lack these three functional domains and induce S phase inefficiently. This group of E2Fs appears necessary for growth arrest and differentiation rather than S phase entry (24Persengiev S.P. Kondova I.I. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6048-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Cartwright P. Muller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K.

A. 1998; 95: 9190-9195Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).In normal cells, transcriptional activation by the E2F family appears to be largely restricted to late G1 and the G1/S boundary. In G0 and early G1, E2F activity is negatively regulated by one or more members of the pRb protein family (27Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 28Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Ewen M. Sellers W.R. Arany Z. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 742-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once cells reach late G1, the Rb family members become phosphorylated and release the E2Fs. There is then a surge of E2F activity (primarily E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3A) that drives the expression of genes that are required for DNA synthesis. Once in S phase, E2F activity is no longer needed, and the cyclin A protein directs the phosphorylation of the three growth-promoting members of the E2F family by the bound Cdk2, leading to their degradation (21Krek W.

This down-regulation of E2F activity by cyclin A is required for orderly S-phase progression (30Logan T.J. Evans D.L. Mercer W.E. Bjornsti M.A. Hall D.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2883-2891PubMed Google Scholar, 31Krek W., Xu, G. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 32Jordan-Sciutto K.L. Hall D.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and in its absence, apoptosis occurs (33Chen Y.N. Sharma S.K. Ramsey T.M. Jiang L. Martin M.S. Baker K.

A. 1999; 96: 4221-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Although the E2F family can be divided into two functional groups, the newest member of the E2F family, E2F-3B, is not easy to classify. E2F-3B lacks the N-terminal domain present in E2F-3, which is also referred to as E2F-3A (35He Y. Armanious M.K. Thomas M.J. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3422-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, it resembles the non-growth-promoting group of E2Fs in structure. The expression pattern of E2F-3B is also consistent with its having a role in growth restraint, since E2F-3B is expressed at its highest levels in G0, where it associates with Rb, and its levels drop as cells enter S phase. This pattern of expression is the opposite of that of E2F-1, -2, and -3A (35He Y. Armanious M.K. Thomas M.J. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3422-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, E2F-3B differs from the growth-restraining E2Fs because it clearly encodes a nuclear localization sequence, as do the growth-promoting E2Fs (35He Y. Armanious M.K. Thomas M.J. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3422-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Before the work described herein, it has not been clear whether E2F-3B contains a functional cyclin A binding domain. Fig. 1 Ahighlights the nuclear localization sequence and putative cyclin A binding domain of E2F-3A and E2F-3B. E2F-3B transcription uses an alternative promoter and an alternative initiation exon (exon 1b) compared with E2F-3A (exon 1a) and shares the same exons from exon 2 onward (36Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Nevins and co-workers (36Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) predict that E2F-3B will not interact with cyclin A, based upon experiments that mapped the E2F-1 cyclin A binding domain to a region that includes the 21 amino acids highlighted in Fig. 1 A (21Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S. Arany Z. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 161-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 37Dynlacht B.D. Moberg K. Lees J.A. Harlow E. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3867-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). If true, this model would suggest that the cyclin A binding domain is encoded in part by exon 1a and in part by exon 2, which seems unlikely. Furthermore, Kaelin and co-workers (38Adams P.D. Sellers W.R. Sharma S.K., Wu, A.D. Nalin C.M. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) show that a significantly shorter sequence in E2F-1 (PAKRRLEL) is sufficient to bind to cyclin A. Because the shorter region is present in both E2F-3A and -3B, we have hypothesized that E2F-3B can still bind cyclin A.In the present work, we test this hypothesis and present several lines of in vivo and in vitro evidence that clearly show that E2F-3B is a physiological target of the cyclin A protein. Because a number of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are in various stages of clinical trials for the treatment of cancer (39Senderowicz A.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6600-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,40Sedlacek H.H. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2001; 38: 139-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we anticipate that E2F-3B may contribute to the activity of these drugs. Thus, the findings of this report may have important clinical ramifications.DISCUSSIONThe promoter of E2F-3A is regulated by Myc and E2F, and is activated in late G1 when cells start to progress into S-phase. E2F-3B, however, is transcribed from an alternative promoter, which is equally active throughout the cell cycle (49Adams M.R. Sears R. Nuckolls F. Leone G. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3633-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed regulation of E2F-3B is apparently at the post-transcriptional level. E2F-3B protein level is the highest in G0, and it rapidly decreases as cells enter S phase. E2F-3A, however, is expressed only at the G1/S transition, and its level goes down after cells progress into S phase. We demonstrate here that cyclin A likely accounts for the observed down-regulation of E2F-3B during S phase. We note that the down-regulation of E2F-3A in S phase appears to lag behind the down-regulation of E2F-3B. We explain this observation in terms of competing synthesis and degradation steps. E2F-3B is synthesized constitutively throughout the cell cycle. Thus, its down-regulation is apparent immediately following up-regulation of cyclin A. In contrast, E2F-3A synthesis occurs in a surge only at the G1/S boundary. Thus, early in S phase, transcriptional up-regulation of E2F-3A temporarily overcomes post-transcriptional down-regulation by cyclin A. Later in S phase, when the cyclin A protein level is high and E2F-3A expression is no longer activated, two levels of down-regulation take over and a rapid decrease in E2F-3A activity is observed.E2F-3A and -3B have particularly important roles in the regulation of the G1/S transition. For example, E2F-3 null mice are the only E2F knockout animals in which defects in cellular proliferation are observed (8Humbert P.O. Verona R. Trimarchi J.M. Rogers C. Dandapani S. Lees J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 690-703PubMed Google Scholar, 50Cloud J.E. Rogers C. Reza T.L. Ziebold U. Stone J.R. Picard M.H. Caron A.M. Bronson R.T. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2663-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Likewise, microinjection of E2F-3A antibodies demonstrates that E2F-3A is the only member of the E2F family essential for S phase induction under physiological expression levels (10Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Because E2F-3A and -3B share an identical DNA binding domain, it is likely that they bind and regulate the same subset of E2F-regulated promoters that are not efficiently recognized by other members of the E2F family. Recent studies contribute to a model for E2F activity in which E2F·Rb complexes in G0 serve to actively repress transcription of the promoters to which they are bound (2Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 3Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). In late G1, the E2F·Rb complexes dissociate (due to Cdk phosphorylation), and E2F-regulated promoters are then bound by activating members of the E2F family. Within this general model it is clear that different members of the E2F family have unique roles (3Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar,51Lavia P. Jansen-Durr P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Promoter binding analysis has shown that distinct complexes of E2F and pRb family members mediate activation or repression throughout the cell cycle (52Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar).Based upon its G0 expression pattern and association with pRb, E2F-3B likely fits into this model primarily as a transcriptional repressor but could also contribute in the activation of genes, including E2F-1, -2, and -3A, in late G1. In contrast, E2F-3A likely serves exclusively as a potent transcriptional activator of genes essential for S phase entry during its brief appearance late in G1. Because E2F-3B has a DNA binding domain that is identical to E2F-3A, its major function may be to make sure that specific E2F-3A-responsive genes will not be active in G0by bringing pRb to the promoter. If E2F-3B is a repressor in G0, inhibition of E2F-3B at G1/S transition will be as important as activation of E2F-3A for G1/S transition. Because both forms are transcriptional activators when not bound by pRb (see Fig. 4), they must be destabilized and removed during S phase lest they induce apoptosis. Finally, once S phase is completed and cyclin A levels drop, E2F-3B levels rebound due to its constitutive synthesis (note the 27- and 30-h time points of Fig. 5). This rebounding of E2F-3B activity is likely necessary to serve as a tether for pRb as cells enter the next G1. The E2Fs represent a family of transcription factors whose activity plays a critical role in cell growth control (1Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 2Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 3Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Specifically, the E2F family controls the expression of genes required for DNA synthesis at the G1/S phase boundary (4Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 5Ishida S. Huang E. Zuzan H. Spang R. Leone G. West M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell.

The first group includes E2F-1, -2, and -3A. These factors represent the growth stimulatory segment of the family, since they are potent transcriptional activators and are required for the entrance of cells into S phase (8Humbert P.O. Verona R.

Structural characteristics of this group include an extended N-terminal region of unknown function, a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and overlapping the NLS, a cyclin A binding domain (17Magae J., Wu, C.L.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 229-236PubMed Google Scholar). The second group includes E2F-4, -5, and -6, which lack these three functional domains and induce S phase inefficiently. This group of E2Fs appears necessary for growth arrest and differentiation rather than S phase entry (24Persengiev S.P. Kondova I.I. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6048-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Cartwright P. Muller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K.

A. 1998; 95: 9190-9195Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In normal cells, transcriptional activation by the E2F family appears to be largely restricted to late G1 and the G1/S boundary. In G0 and early G1, E2F activity is negatively regulated by one or more members of the pRb protein family (27Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 28Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Ewen M. Sellers W.R. Arany Z. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 742-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once cells reach late G1, the Rb family members become phosphorylated and release the E2Fs. There is then a surge of E2F activity (primarily E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3A) that drives the expression of genes that are required for DNA synthesis. Once in S phase, E2F activity is no longer needed, and the cyclin A protein directs the phosphorylation of the three growth-promoting members of the E2F family by the bound Cdk2, leading to their degradation (21Krek W.

This down-regulation of E2F activity by cyclin A is required for orderly S-phase progression (30Logan T.J. Evans D.L. Mercer W.E. Bjornsti M.A. Hall D.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2883-2891PubMed Google Scholar, 31Krek W., Xu, G. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 32Jordan-Sciutto K.L. Hall D.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and in its absence, apoptosis occurs (33Chen Y.N. Sharma S.K. Ramsey T.M. Jiang L. Martin M.S. Baker K.

A. 1999; 96: 4221-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the E2F family can be divided into two functional groups, the newest member of the E2F family, E2F-3B, is not easy to classify. E2F-3B lacks the N-terminal domain present in E2F-3, which is also referred to as E2F-3A (35He Y. Armanious M.K. Thomas M.J. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3422-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, it resembles the non-growth-promoting group of E2Fs in structure. The expression pattern of E2F-3B is also consistent with its having a role in growth restraint, since E2F-3B is expressed at its highest levels in G0, where it associates with Rb, and its levels drop as cells enter S phase. This pattern of expression is the opposite of that of E2F-1, -2, and -3A (35He Y. Armanious M.K. Thomas M.J. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3422-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, E2F-3B differs from the growth-restraining E2Fs because it clearly encodes a nuclear localization sequence, as do the growth-promoting E2Fs (35He Y. Armanious M.K. Thomas M.J. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3422-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Before the work described herein, it has not been clear whether E2F-3B contains a functional cyclin A binding domain. Fig. 1 Ahighlights the nuclear localization sequence and putative cyclin A binding domain of E2F-3A and E2F-3B. E2F-3B transcription uses an alternative promoter and an alternative initiation exon (exon 1b) compared with E2F-3A (exon 1a) and shares the same exons from exon 2 onward (36Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Nevins and co-workers (36Leone G. Nuckolls F. Ishida S. Adams M. Sears R. Jakoi L. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3626-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) predict that E2F-3B will not interact with cyclin A, based upon experiments that mapped the E2F-1 cyclin A binding domain to a region that includes the 21 amino acids highlighted in Fig. 1 A (21Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S. Arany Z. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 161-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 37Dynlacht B.D. Moberg K. Lees J.A. Harlow E. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3867-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). If true, this model would suggest that the cyclin A binding domain is encoded in part by exon 1a and in part by exon 2, which seems unlikely. Furthermore, Kaelin and co-workers (38Adams P.D. Sellers W.R. Sharma S.K., Wu, A.D. Nalin C.M. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) show that a significantly shorter sequence in E2F-1 (PAKRRLEL) is sufficient to bind to cyclin A. Because the shorter region is present in both E2F-3A and -3B, we have hypothesized that E2F-3B can still bind cyclin A. In the present work, we test this hypothesis and present several lines of in vivo and in vitro evidence that clearly show that E2F-3B is a physiological target of the cyclin A protein. Because a number of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are in various stages of clinical trials for the treatment of cancer (39Senderowicz A.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6600-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,40Sedlacek H.H. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2001; 38: 139-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we anticipate that E2F-3B may contribute to the activity of these drugs. Thus, the findings of this report may have important clinical ramifications. DISCUSSIONThe promoter of E2F-3A is regulated by Myc and E2F, and is activated in late G1 when cells start to progress into S-phase. E2F-3B, however, is transcribed from an alternative promoter, which is equally active throughout the cell cycle (49Adams M.R. Sears R. Nuckolls F. Leone G. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell.

In late G1, the E2F·Rb complexes dissociate (due to Cdk phosphorylation), and E2F-regulated promoters are then bound by activating members of the E2F family. Within this general model it is clear that different members of the E2F family have unique roles (3Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar,51Lavia P. Jansen-Durr P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Promoter binding analysis has shown that distinct complexes of E2F and pRb family members mediate activation or repression throughout the cell cycle (52Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon its G0 expression pattern and association with pRb, E2F-3B likely fits into this model primarily as a transcriptional repressor but could also contribute in the activation of genes, including E2F-1, -2, and -3A, in late G1. In contrast, E2F-3A likely serves exclusively as a potent transcriptional activator of genes essential for S phase entry during its brief appearance late in G1. Because E2F-3B has a DNA binding domain that is identical to E2F-3A, its major function may be to make sure that specific E2F-3A-responsive genes will not be active in G0by bringing pRb to the promoter. If E2F-3B is a repressor in G0, inhibition of E2F-3B at G1/S transition will be as important as activation of E2F-3A for G1/S transition. Because both forms are transcriptional activators when not bound by pRb (see Fig. 4), they must be destabilized and removed during S phase lest they induce apoptosis. Finally, once S phase is completed and cyclin A levels drop, E2F-3B levels rebound due to its constitutive synthesis (note the 27- and 30-h time points of Fig. 5). This rebounding of E2F-3B activity is likely necessary to serve as a tether for pRb as cells enter the next G1. We thank Drs.
