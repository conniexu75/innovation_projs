https://openalex.org/W1508064959,"Fully reduced ribonuclease (RNase), devoid of demonstrable secondary or tertiary structure, may be oxidized by molecular oxygen to yield a product which is indistinguishable by physical measurements or enzymatic activity from the native enzyme (2-4). Since reduced RNase contains eight sulfhydryl groups, 105 possible arrangements with four disulfide bridges may occur (5, 6), yet the native enzyme can be recovered in nearly quantitative yields after such oxidations. It is apparent, then, that certain interactions among elements of the primary structure must serve as guides for the unique pairing of sulfhydryl groups. An attempt has been made to study these interactions by carrying out oxidations of reduced RNase in the presence of various reagents known to influence interor intramolecular bonding. Enzymatically inactive derivatives were produced, quite similar to native RNase in physical properties, which could, under appropriate circumstances, be rearranged to the native enzyme. These materials are believed to be a mixture representing some, if not all, of the possible isomeric configurations of disulfide bonding in the molecule. The observation that this mixture of materials can be readily converted to the native structure is taken as evidence that the unique secondary and tertiary structure of RNase is, thermodynamically, the most stable configuration."

https://openalex.org/W1982949378,"IT is frequently stated that, apart from the effects of mutation and migration, two autosomal allelomorphs can only be in stable equilibrium if the heterozygote is fitter than either homozygote, or if the fitness of genotypes varies with their frequency in the population. This is not true."

When mice of this group and mice of control groups were later challenged through intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of the same Staphylococcus aureus, the death rate for the experimental group was found to be much lower than the death rate for the controls."

https://openalex.org/W2003299996,"RAT milk contains a large amount of fat and protein1. The amount of sugar in this food is just sufficient to cover the energy needs of the infant rat for about 2 hr., and it is thus obvious that the energy required for the remaining 22 hr. of the day must come either from fat or protein. This is underlined by the fact that liver and muscle glycogen content, although falling transiently shortly after birth, soon return to higher levels2."

https://openalex.org/W1968706580,"EXPERIENCE in the United States and elsewhere has shown that the main source for the fluoride intake in man for the partial prevention of dental caries is the water supply. Results from recent investigations in India and Greece strongly suggest that the daily consumption of sea salt by the people of these countries may have been another major source of dietary fluoride. Sea salt was reported to contain 40 p.p.m. of fluoride1. The fluoride content of teeth from India and Greece was found to be considerably high although the level in the water supplies was negligible1,2. In addition, the prevalence of caries in the two countries has been reported to be low1,3."

The reason for the caries-producing property of millet could not be explained."

https://openalex.org/W2079194378,"THE possible role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) regarding its action on the mammalian nervous system has been discussed repeatedly. However, pharmacological investigations were not very successful in clarifying this role. The well-known approach of using ‘specific’ antagonists against the neural effects of 5-HT has been stranded on two grounds: (a) the commonly known blocking agents of 5-HT are in fact only antagonists of 5-HT on smooth muscles, and (b) the actions of 5-HT on nervous receptors, except for a few peripheral sensory and ganglionic receptors, are not adequately explored. Recent investigations1 demonstrate that even those agents which were shown before to block certain hypothetical nervous receptors of the guinea pig ileum2 are of fairly low potency and/or selectivity to the ganglionic stimulant action of 5-HT. The tachy-phylaxis observed in the ganglionic action of 5-HT suggested the use of compounds structurally closely related to 5-HT as its possible antagonists. One of these compounds, 5-hydroxy-3-indoleacetamidine (5-HTA), which was first described as a 5-HT-like stimulant agent3, showed the following unique characteristics:"

https://openalex.org/W2028492757,"A chromatographic study of molecular changes in DNA after in vitro exposure to x-rays revealed little effect on the DNA macromolecule when either intact red cells of frog or DNA isolated from these cells was exposed to 1000 r. Increasing the dose to 10,000 r resulted in a significant shift from gradients of lower molecular weight to the higher gradients. These data suggest that cross-linking of DNA occurred at the higher radiation level."

https://openalex.org/W2049214511,"INVESTIGATIONS into taste sensitivity for bitter as a particular hereditary characteristic in man have found their practical application in human, that is, population genetics. Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) has been found the most reliable among the bitter substances used for discrimination between sensitive persons and insensitive. We believe that of the different methods described1–3 the most advantageous one is that of Harris and Kalmus4–7. In addition to the testing and checking of modes of heredity, the establishment of frequency of tasters and non-tasters, a relation between the sensitivity for PTC and the thyroid diseases has been noted7,8. Recently there seem to have been new developments in the interpretation of this relation9."
https://openalex.org/W1997322137,"IN the study of heat exchanges between the human body and its environment, physiologists in the past have been interested to know the area of the surface of the experimental subject, as this quantity appears in the equations concerning convection, radiation and evaporation. In the past, surface areas were determined by covering the surface of the human subject with patches of paper and then measuring the area of all the patches after they had been stripped off the subject. Such a method is very tedious; and an approximate equation relating surface area to the height and the weight of the subject was evolved. This equation is admittedly approximate and it cannot be maintained that it will be satisfactory for all ethnic types."

Troughs have also been made from stainless steel5,6and from pressed sheet metal coated with resistant enamel7, but these are not easy to make and are relatively costly, especially for workers in areas where financial grants are meagre and materials and apparatus difficult to obtain."
