https://openalex.org/W2101664092,"Barrier epithelial cells and airway dendritic cells (DCs) make up the first line of defense against inhaled substances such as house dust mite (HDM) allergen and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). We hypothesized that these cells need to communicate with each other to cause allergic disease. We show in irradiated chimeric mice that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression on radioresistant lung structural cells, but not on DCs, is necessary and sufficient for DC activation in the lung and for priming of effector T helper responses to HDM. TLR4 triggering on structural cells caused production of the innate proallergic cytokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-25 and interleukin-33. The absence of TLR4 on structural cells, but not on hematopoietic cells, abolished HDM-driven allergic airway inflammation. Finally, inhalation of a TLR4 antagonist to target exposed epithelial cells suppressed the salient features of asthma, including bronchial hyperreactivity. Our data identify an innate immune function of airway epithelial cells that drives allergic inflammation via activation of mucosal DCs."
https://openalex.org/W2014852291,"Ball et al. exploit next-generation sequencing to detect methylation across the human genome. A targeted approach uses padlock probes and bisulfite-treated DNA, whereas an untargeted method relies on the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII. Studies of epigenetic modifications would benefit from improved methods for high-throughput methylation profiling. We introduce two complementary approaches that use next-generation sequencing technology to detect cytosine methylation. In the first method, we designed ∼10,000 bisulfite padlock probes to profile ∼7,000 CpG locations distributed over the ENCODE pilot project regions and applied them to human B-lymphocytes, fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells. This unbiased choice of targets takes advantage of existing expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation data and enabled us to observe a pattern of low promoter methylation and high gene-body methylation in highly expressed genes. The second method, methyl-sensitive cut counting, generated nontargeted genome-scale data for ∼1.4 million HpaII sites in the DNA of B-lymphocytes and confirmed that gene-body methylation in highly expressed genes is a consistent phenomenon throughout the human genome. Our observations highlight the usefulness of techniques that are not inherently or intentionally biased towards particular subsets like CpG islands or promoter regions."
https://openalex.org/W2033675290,"Typically developing human infants preferentially attend to biological motion within the first days of life. This ability is highly conserved across species and is believed to be critical for filial attachment and for detection of predators. The neural underpinnings of biological motion perception are overlapping with brain regions involved in perception of basic social signals such as facial expression and gaze direction, and preferential attention to biological motion is seen as a precursor to the capacity for attributing intentions to others. However, in a serendipitous observation, we recently found that an infant with autism failed to recognize point-light displays of biological motion, but was instead highly sensitive to the presence of a non-social, physical contingency that occurred within the stimuli by chance. This observation raised the possibility that perception of biological motion may be altered in children with autism from a very early age, with cascading consequences for both social development and the lifelong impairments in social interaction that are a hallmark of autism spectrum disorders. Here we show that two-year-olds with autism fail to orient towards point-light displays of biological motion, and their viewing behaviour when watching these point-light displays can be explained instead as a response to non-social, physical contingencies--physical contingencies that are disregarded by control children. This observation has far-reaching implications for understanding the altered neurodevelopmental trajectory of brain specialization in autism."
https://openalex.org/W2024985626,"Somatically acquired epigenetic changes are present in many cancers. Epigenetic regulation is maintained via post-translational modifications of core histones. Here, we describe inactivating somatic mutations in the histone lysine demethylase gene UTX, pointing to histone H3 lysine methylation deregulation in multiple tumor types. UTX reintroduction into cancer cells with inactivating UTX mutations resulted in slowing of proliferation and marked transcriptional changes. These data identify UTX as a new human cancer gene."
https://openalex.org/W2055928084,"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome that is often difficult to treat. Hiroshi Watanabe and coworkers now show that flecainide, an approved drug known to inhibit sodium channels, is able to target the underlying cause of CPVT by inhibiting calcium release through the ryanodine receptor. Flecainide prevented arrhythmia in a mouse model of CPVT and was also effective when tested in two individuals with CPVT. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a potentially lethal inherited arrhythmia syndrome in which drug therapy is often ineffective. We discovered that flecainide prevents arrhythmias in a mouse model of CPVT by inhibiting cardiac ryanodine receptor–mediated Ca2+ release and thereby directly targeting the underlying molecular defect. Flecainide completely prevented CPVT in two human subjects who had remained highly symptomatic on conventional drug therapy, indicating that this currently available drug is a promising mechanism-based therapy for CPVT."
https://openalex.org/W2103123188,"We conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of breast cancer in 9,770 cases and 10,799 controls in the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) initiative. In stage 1, we genotyped 528,173 SNPs in 1,145 cases of invasive breast cancer and 1,142 controls. In stage 2, we analyzed 24,909 top SNPs in 4,547 cases and 4,434 controls. In stage 3, we investigated 21 loci in 4,078 cases and 5,223 controls. Two new loci achieved genome-wide significance. A pericentromeric SNP on chromosome 1p11.2 (rs11249433; P = 6.74 x 10(-10) adjusted genotype test, 2 degrees of freedom) resides in a large linkage disequilibrium block neighboring NOTCH2 and FCGR1B; this signal was stronger for estrogen-receptor-positive tumors. A second SNP on chromosome 14q24.1 (rs999737; P = 1.74 x 10(-7)) localizes to RAD51L1, a gene in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. We also confirmed associations with loci on chromosomes 2q35, 5p12, 5q11.2, 8q24, 10q26 and 16q12.1."

https://openalex.org/W2064041354,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified seven breast cancer susceptibility loci, but these explain only a small fraction of the familial risk of the disease. Five of these loci were identified through a two-stage GWAS involving 390 familial cases and 364 controls in the first stage, and 3,990 cases and 3,916 controls in the second stage. To identify additional loci, we tested over 800 promising associations from this GWAS in a further two stages involving 37,012 cases and 40,069 controls from 33 studies in the CGEMS collaboration and Breast Cancer Association Consortium. We found strong evidence for additional susceptibility loci on 3p (rs4973768: per-allele OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.08-1.13, P = 4.1 x 10(-23)) and 17q (rs6504950: per-allele OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.92-0.97, P = 1.4 x 10(-8)). Potential causative genes include SLC4A7 and NEK10 on 3p and COX11 on 17q."
https://openalex.org/W2161315819,"Current DNA methylation assays are limited in the flexibility and efficiency of characterizing a large number of genomic targets. We report a method to specifically capture an arbitrary subset of genomic targets for single-molecule bisulfite sequencing for digital quantification of DNA methylation at single-nucleotide resolution. A set of ~30,000 padlock probes was designed to assess methylation of ~66,000 CpG sites within 2,020 CpG islands on human chromosome 12, chromosome 20, and 34 selected regions. To investigate epigenetic differences associated with dedifferentiation, we compared methylation in three human fibroblast lines and eight human pluripotent stem cell lines. Chromosome-wide methylation patterns were similar among all lines studied, but cytosine methylation was slightly more prevalent in the pluripotent cells than in the fibroblasts. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells appeared to display more methylation than embryonic stem cells. We found 288 regions methylated differently in fibroblasts and pluripotent cells. This targeted approach should be particularly useful for analyzing DNA methylation in large genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2000024765,"This study finds that playing an action video game results in improvements in visual contrast sensitivity. These improvements do not happen for an equivalent group who played a non-action video game. The contrast sensitivity function (CSF) is routinely assessed in clinical evaluation of vision and is the primary limiting factor in how well one sees. CSF improvements are typically brought about by correction of the optics of the eye with eyeglasses, contact lenses or surgery. We found that the very act of action video game playing also enhanced contrast sensitivity, providing a complementary route to eyesight improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2163356019,"Mechanically sensitive transducer channels are responsible for the detection of sound-induced hair cell vibrations. However, the location of these channels in the stereociliary bundle has been unclear. Using high-speed calcium imaging, this study demonstrates that there are no transduction channels in the tallest row of stereocilia in the mammalian cochlea. Instead, these channels are more likely to be present in the bottom stereociliary rows. Hair cells detect vibrations of their stereociliary bundle by activation of mechanically sensitive transducer channels. Although evidence suggests the transducer channels are near the stereociliary tops and are opened by force imparted by tip links connecting contiguous stereocilia, the exact channel site remains controversial. We used fast confocal imaging of fluorescence changes reflecting calcium entry during bundle stimulation to localize the channels. Calcium signals were visible in single stereocilia of rat cochlear inner hair cells and were up to tenfold larger and faster in the second and third stereociliary rows than in the tallest first row. The number of functional stereocilia was proportional to transducer current amplitude, indicating that there were about two channels per stereocilium. Comparable results were obtained in outer hair cells. The observations, supported by theoretical simulations, suggest there are no functional mechanically sensitive transducer channels in first row stereocilia and imply the channels are present only at the bottom of the tip links."
https://openalex.org/W2094884053,"Visceral adiposity in obesity causes excessive free fatty acid (FFA) flux into the liver via the portal vein and may cause fatty liver disease and hepatic insulin resistance. However, because animal models of insulin resistance induced by lipid infusion or a high fat diet are complex and may be accompanied by alterations not restricted to the liver, it is difficult to determine the contribution of FFAs to hepatic insulin resistance. Therefore, we treated H4IIEC3 cells, a rat hepatocyte cell line, with a monounsaturated fatty acid (oleate) and a saturated fatty acid (palmitate) to investigate the direct and initial effects of FFAs on hepatocytes. We show that palmitate, but not oleate, inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 2 and serine phosphorylation of Akt, through c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Among the well established stimuli for JNK activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) played a causal role in palmitate-induced JNK activation. In addition, etomoxir, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, as well as inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (thenoyltrifluoroacetone and carbonyl cyanide <i>m</i>-chlorophenylhydrazone) decreased palmitate-induced ROS production. Together, our findings in hepatocytes indicate that palmitate inhibited insulin signal transduction through JNK activation and that accelerated β-oxidation of palmitate caused excess electron flux in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in increased ROS generation. Thus, mitochondria-derived ROS induced by palmitate may be major contributors to JNK activation and cellular insulin resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2044247371,"Dynamic actin remodelling processes at the leading edge of migrating tumour cells are concerted events controlled by a fine-tuned temporal and spatial interplay of kinases and phosphatases. Actin severing is regulated by actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin, which regulates stimulus-induced lamellipodia protrusion and directed cell motility. Cofilin is activated by dephosphorylation through phosphatases of the slingshot (SSH) family. SSH activity is strongly increased by its binding to filamentous actin (F-actin); however, other upstream regulators remain unknown. Here we show that in response to RhoA activation, protein kinase D1 (PKD1) phosphorylates the SSH enzyme SSH1L at a serine residue located in its actin-binding motif. This generates a 14-3-3-binding motif and blocks the localization of SSH1L to F-actin-rich structures in the lamellipodium by sequestering it in the cytoplasm. Consequently, expression of constitutively active PKD1 in invasive tumour cells enhanced the phosphorylation of cofilin and effectively blocked the formation of free actin-filament barbed ends and directed cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2163824404,"High-throughput screening to discover small-molecule modulators of enzymes typically relies on highly tailored substrate assays, which are not available for poorly characterized enzymes. Here we report a general, substrate-free method for identifying inhibitors of uncharacterized enzymes. The assay measures changes in the kinetics of covalent active-site labeling with broad-spectrum, fluorescent probes in the presence of inhibitors by monitoring the fluorescence polarization signal. We show that this technology is applicable to enzymes from at least two mechanistic classes, regardless of their degree of functional annotation, and can be coupled with secondary proteomic assays that use competitive activity-based profiling to rapidly determine the specificity of screening hits. Using this method, we identify the bioactive alkaloid emetine as a selective inhibitor of the uncharacterized cancer-associated hydrolase RBBP9. Furthermore, we show that the detoxification enzyme GSTO1, also implicated in cancer, is inhibited by several electrophilic compounds found in public libraries, some of which display high selectivity for this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2003615946,"During the formation of synapses, specific regions of pre- and postsynaptic cells associate to form a single functional transmission unit. In this process, synaptogenic factors are necessary to modulate pre- and postsynaptic differentiation. In mammals, different Wnt ligands operate through canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, and their precise functions to coordinate synapse structure and function in the mature central nervous system are still largely unknown. Here, we studied the effect of different Wnt ligands on postsynaptic organization. We found that Wnt-5a induces short term changes in the clustering of PSD-95, without affecting its total levels. Wnt-5a promotes the recruitment of PSD-95 from a diffuse dendritic cytoplasmic pool to form new PSD-95 clusters in dendritic spines. Moreover, Wnt-5a acting as a non-canonical ligand regulates PSD-95 distribution through a JNK-dependent signaling pathway, as demonstrated by using the TAT-TI-JIP peptide in mature hippocampal neurons. Finally, using adult rat hippocampal slices, we found that Wnt-5a modulates glutamatergic synaptic transmission through a postsynaptic mechanism. Our studies indicate that the Wnt-5a/JNK pathway modulates the postsynaptic region of mammalian synapse directing the clustering and distribution of the physiologically relevant scaffold protein, PSD-95."
https://openalex.org/W2130027655,"The Trk family of neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptors is emerging as an important player in carcinogenic progression in non-neuronal tissues. Here, we show that breast tumors present high levels of TrkA and phospho-TrkA compared to normal breast tissues. To further evaluate the precise functions of TrkA overexpression in breast cancer development, we have performed a series of biological tests using breast cancer cells that stably overexpress TrkA. We show that (1) TrkA overexpression promoted cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro; (2) overexpression of TrkA per se conferred constitutive activation of its tyrosine kinase activity; (3) signal pathways including PI3K-Akt and ERK/p38 MAP kinases were activated by TrkA overexpression and were required for the maintenance of a more aggressive cellular phenotype; and (4) TrkA overexpression enhanced tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis of xenografted breast cancer cells in immunodeficient mice. Moreover, recovered metastatic cells from the lungs exhibited enhanced anoikis resistance that was abolished by the pharmacological inhibitor K252a, suggesting that TrkA-promoted breast tumor metastasis could be mediated at least in part by enhancing anoikis resistance. Together, these results provide the first direct evidence that TrkA overexpression enhances the tumorigenic properties of breast cancer cells and point to TrkA as a potential target in breast cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2003111150,"The co-activator Yorkie (Yki) mediates transcriptional regulation effected by the Drosophila Fat–Warts (Wts)–Hippo (Hpo) pathways. Yki is inhibited by Wts-mediated phosphorylation, and a Wts phosphorylation site at Ser168 has been identified. Here we identify two additional Wts phosphorylation sites on Yki, and examine the respective contribution of all three sites to Yki nuclear localization and activity. Our results show that although Ser168 is the most critical site, all three phosphorylation sites influence Yki localization and activity in vivo, and can be sites of regulation by Wts. Thus, investigations of the role of Yki and its mammalian homolog Yes-associated protein (YAP) in development and oncogenesis should include evaluations of additional sites. The WW domains of Yki are not required for its phosphorylation, but instead are positively required for its activity. We also identify two potential sites of phosphorylation by an unknown kinase, which could influence phosphorylation of Ser168 by Wts, suggesting that there are additional mechanisms for regulating Yki/YAP activity."

Five mutations in one of the most commonly mutated genes, MMP8, reduced MMP enzyme activity. Expression of wild-type but not mutant MMP8 in human melanoma cells inhibited growth on soft agar in vitro and tumor formation in vivo, suggesting that wild-type MMP-8 has the ability to inhibit melanoma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2170556702,"Background Under the direction and sponsorship of the National Cancer Institute, we report on the first pre-clinical trial of the Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium (COTC). The COTC is a novel infrastructure to integrate cancers that naturally develop in pet dogs into the development path of new human drugs. Trials are designed to address questions challenging in conventional preclinical models and early phase human trials. Large animal spontaneous cancer models can be a valuable addition to successful studies of cancer biology and novel therapeutic drug, imaging and device development. Methodology/Principal Findings Through this established infrastructure, the first trial of the COTC (COTC001) evaluated a targeted AAV-phage vector delivering tumor necrosis factor (RGD-A-TNF) to αV integrins on tumor endothelium. Trial progress and data was reviewed contemporaneously using a web-enabled electronic reporting system developed for the consortium. Dose-escalation in cohorts of 3 dogs (n = 24) determined an optimal safe dose (5×1012 transducing units intravenous) of RGD-A-TNF. This demonstrated selective targeting of tumor-associated vasculature and sparing of normal tissues assessed via serial biopsy of both tumor and normal tissue. Repetitive dosing in a cohort of 14 dogs, at the defined optimal dose, was well tolerated and led to objective tumor regression in two dogs (14%), stable disease in six (43%), and disease progression in six (43%) via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Conclusions/Significance The first study of the COTC has demonstrated the utility and efficiency of the established infrastructure to inform the development of new cancer drugs within large animal naturally occurring cancer models. The preclinical evaluation of RGD-A-TNF within this network provided valuable and necessary data to complete the design of first-in-man studies."
https://openalex.org/W2065699183,"During space flight, severe losses of bone mass are observed. Both bone formation and resorption are probably involved, but their relative importance remains unclear. The purpose of this research is to understand the role of osteoclasts and their precursors in microgravity-induced bone loss. Three experiments on isolated osteoclasts (OCs) and on their precursors, OSTEO, OCLAST, and PITS, were launched in the FOTON-M3 mission. The OSTEO experiment was conducted for 10 d in microgravity within bioreactors with a perfusion system, where the differentiation of precursors, cultured on a synthetic 3-dimensional bonelike biomaterial, skelite, toward mature OCs was assessed. In OCLAST and in PITS experiments, differentiated OCs were cultured on devitalized bovine bone slices for 4 d in microgravity. All of the experiments were replicated on ground in the same bioreactors, and OCLAST also had an inflight centrifuge as a control. Gene expression in microgravity, compared with ground controls, demonstrated a severalfold increase in genes involved in osteoclast maturation and activity. Increased bone resorption, proved by an increased amount of collagen telopeptides released VS ground and centrifuge control, was also found. These results indicate for the first time osteoclasts and their precursors as direct targets for microgravity and mechanical forces."
https://openalex.org/W2140760195,"Coexistence of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer in clinic poses significant challenges for the diagnostic and treatment of both diseases. Although association of chronic inflammation and cancer is well-documented, causal relationship between TB infection and lung cancer are not understood. We present experimental evidence that chronic TB infection induces cell dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in a lung-specific manner. First, squamous cell aggregates consistently appeared within the lung tissue associated with chronic TB lesions, and in some cases resembled SCCs. A transplantable tumor was established after the transfer of cells isolated from TB lung lesions into syngeneic recipients. Second, the (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) MTB-infected macrophages play a pivotal role in TB-induced carcinogenesis by inducing DNA damage in their vicinity and by the production of a potent epidermal growth factor epiregulin, which may serve as a paracrine survival and growth factor responsible for squamous metaplasia and tumorigenesis. Third, lung carcinogenesis during the course of chronic TB infection was more pronounced in animals with severe lung tissue damage mediated by TB-susceptibility locus sst1. Together, our experimental findings showed a causal link between pulmonary TB and lung tumorigenesis and established a genetic model for further analysis of carcinogenic mechanisms activated by TB infection."
https://openalex.org/W1985160458,"Co-amplification at chromosomes 8p11–8p12 and 11q12–11q14 occurs often in breast tumors, suggesting possible cooperation between genes in these regions in oncogenesis. We used high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) to map the minimal amplified regions. The 8p and 11q amplicons are complex and consist of at least four amplicon cores at each site. Candidate oncogenes mapping to these regions were identified by combining copy number and RNA and protein expression analyses. These studies also suggested that CCND1 at 11q13 induced expression of ZNF703 mapping at 8p12, which was subsequently shown to be mediated by the Rb/E2F pathway. Nine candidate oncogenes from 8p12 and four from 11q13 were further evaluated for oncogenic function. None of the genes individually promoted colony formation in soft agar or collaborated with each other functionally. On the other hand, FGFR1 and DDHD2 at 8p12 cooperated functionally with MYC, whereas CCND1 and ZNF703 cooperated with a dominant negative form of TP53. These observations highlight the complexity and functional consequences of the genomic rearrangements that occur in these breast cancer amplicons, including transcriptional cross-talk between genes in the 8p and 11q amplicons, as well as their cooperation with major pathways of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2013468241,"We investigated the role of G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation in agonist-induced desensitization, arrestin association, endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking of the D(2) dopamine receptor (DAR). Agonist activation of D(2) DARs results in rapid and sustained receptor phosphorylation that is solely mediated by GRKs. A survey of GRKs revealed that only GRK2 or GRK3 promotes D(2) DAR phosphorylation. Mutational analyses resulted in the identification of eight serine/threonine residues within the third cytoplasmic loop of the receptor that are phosphorylated by GRK2/3. Simultaneous mutation of these eight residues results in a receptor construct, GRK(-), that is completely devoid of agonist-promoted GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation. We found that both wild-type (WT) and GRK(-) receptors underwent a similar degree of agonist-induced desensitization as assessed using [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assays. Similarly, both receptor constructs internalized to the same extent in response to agonist treatment. Furthermore, using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays to directly assess receptor association with arrestin3, we found no differences between the WT and GRK(-) receptors. Thus, phosphorylation is not required for arrestin-receptor association or agonist-induced desensitization or internalization. In contrast, when we examined recycling of the D(2) DARs to the cell surface, subsequent to agonist-induced endocytosis, the GRK(-) construct exhibited less recycling in comparison with the WT receptor. This impairment appears to be due to a greater propensity of the GRK(-) receptors to down-regulate once internalized. In contrast, if the receptor is highly phosphorylated, then receptor recycling is promoted. These results reveal a novel role for GRK-mediated phosphorylation in regulating the post-endocytic trafficking of a G protein-coupled receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2046747899,"Chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT) is a large multisubunit complex that mediates protein folding in eukaryotic cells. CCT participates in the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, including actin, tubulin, and several cell cycle regulators; therefore, CCT plays an important role in cytoskeletal organization and cell division. Here we identify the chaperonin CCT as a novel physiological substrate for p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K). RSK phosphorylates the β subunit of CCT in response to tumor promoters or growth factors that activate the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. CCTβ Ser-260 was identified as the RSK site by mass spectrometry and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. RSK-dependent Ser-260 phosphorylation was sensitive to the MEK inhibitor UO126 and the RSK inhibitor BID-1870. Insulin weakly activates RSK but strongly activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and utilizes S6K to regulate CCTβ phosphorylation. Thus, the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-mTOR pathways converge on CCTβ Ser-260 phosphorylation in response to multiple agonists in various mammalian cells. We also show that RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous CCTβ causes impaired cell proliferation that can be rescued with ectopically expressed murine CCTβ wild-type or phosphomimetic mutant S260D, but not the phosphorylation-deficient mutant S260A.

The PI3K-mTOR pathway plays a critical role in this process, whereas the Ras-MAPK pathway converges at various common as well as unique points and therefore also modulates translational activity in cells. RSK or Akt phosphorylation of TSC2 at unique and overlapping sites results in activation of mTOR-S6K pathway leading to translation initiation (8Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J.

RSK and S6K phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor 4B at Ser-422, which is important for its recruitment into the translation preinitiation complex (11Raught B. Peiretti F. Gingras A.C.

S6K phosphorylates the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 at Ser-235, Ser-236, Ser-240, Ser-244, and Ser-247, where RSK phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein at Ser-235/236 also correlates with induction of cap-dependent translation (14Roux P.P.

Thus, S6K and RSK are regarded as critical regulators for growth factor-mediated translational control. The identification and functional characterization of novel substrates for RSK and S6K is essential for expanding our understanding of the physiological function of two different families of ribosomal S6 kinases in cells. To achieve this, we have applied proteomic approaches. A unique antibody raised against the consensus Akt phosphorylation motif RXRXXpS/pT has been successfully used to identify Akt substrates, including Tuberin (8Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N.

Based on the fact that RSK and S6K belong to the AGC (protein kinases A, G, and C) kinase superfamily, which display a preference for basophilic sites, including the RXRXXpS/pT motif, we used this antibody to identify additional substrates for RSK and S6K. Here we report the identification of the eukaryotic chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT) as a downstream target for RSK and S6K in the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-mTOR pathways. The chaperonin CCT, also known as TRiC, is composed of eight different subunits and is the protein folding machinery that binds nascent polypeptides from ribosomes (19Frydman J. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 2008; 15: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Given the connection between mitogen-stimulated kinases and enhanced protein synthetic rates, we hypothesized that the protein folding activity of CCT might provide a mechanism to coordinate S6K- and RSK-regulated protein synthesis with protein folding, and in so doing, also reduce potential unfolded protein stress responses. As a first step in addressing this potential link between growth factor signaling and the biological processes regulated by CCT, we show that RSK and S6K phosphorylate the CCTβ subunit at Ser-260. Furthermore, we show that CCTβ plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and that Ser-260 phosphorylation contributes significantly to this process. Thus, the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-mTOR pathways utilize RSK and S6K to converge upon the phosphorylation and regulation of CCTβ function in mammalian cells. Materials—Anti-CCTα, anti-CCTβ, anti-CCTη, and anti-actin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody, anti-FLAG antibody, anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel, FLAG peptide, insulin, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and Polybrene were purchased from Sigma. Anti-phospho-Akt substrate (αPAS) antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-RSK antibody was kindly provided from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Anti-ERK1/2 antibody was prepared in the laboratory (31Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Margaret Chou (University of Pennsylvania). LY294002 and UO126 were purchased from Calbiochem. Lipofectamine 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen.

Characterization of the synthesized compound by 1H NMR and reversed-phase liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) confirmed a chemical structure consistent with BI-D1870. Plasmids—The plasmids encoding HA-tagged human RSK1, mouse RSK2, and their kinase inactive mutants were used in this study. The human CCTβ cDNA was cloned into pKFLAG in fusion with a FLAG tag. Point mutated cDNA was generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), and fragments were cloned into pKFLAG, pGEX, and pLNCX2, respectively. The generation of pRK7-HA-WT S6K1 or Akt has been described previously (33Martin K.A. Schalm S.S. Richardson C. Romanelli A. Keon K.L. Blenis J. J. Biol.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Viral Infection—HEK293E cells, U2-OS cells, and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MCF10A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media containing 5% horse serum, 20 ng/ml EGF, 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin. Human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) were obtained from Cambrex and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media containing 10 ng/ml EGF, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone. The HMECs were immortalized by sequential infection with pBabeZeo-hTERT and pBabeHygro-dominant negative p53DD retrovirus (34Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). They were made to overexpress EGFR by infection with pwzlBlast-EGFR retrovirus and selection with 0.25 μg/ml Blastocidin. For transfection of small interference RNA (siRNA) or DNA plasmids, conventional calcium phosphate precipitation was performed. RSK siRNA was described elsewhere (35Anjum R. Roux P.P. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1762-1767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 24 h following transfection, starved for 24 h, and used for the assay. For short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of endogenous CCTβ, lentivirus was produced using the pLKO vector system (Open Biosystems), and cells infected in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Two days after viral infection, cells were treated and selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin. shRNAs were obtained from Open Biosystems (shRNA1, TRCN0000029499; shRNA2, TRCN0000029450). Retrovirus was produced using pLNCX2 vector system to overexpress ectopic human or murine CCTβ, and 2 days after viral infection, cells were selected with 100 or 400 μg/ml G418 for HMECs or U2-OS cells, respectively. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were extracted with lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin) containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected and incubated with antibody at 4 °C for 2 h and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose (1:1) for an additional hour. Beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer and eluted in 2× reducing sample buffer (5×: 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 14.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel was used for immunoprecipitation of FLAG fusion proteins in accordance with the instruction manual. Immunoblot Analysis—For immunoblot analysis, the cells were extracted in the lysis buffer A, and reducing buffer was added to the extracts. Samples were boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman). The membranes were blocked with TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH. 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 3% nonfat dried milk or 2% bovine serum albumin, and probed overnight with primary antibodies, washed three times for 10 min each, and then probed for 1 h with secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Cell Proliferation Assay—HMECs or U2-OS were seeded at 2 × 10 4 cells per 6-cm plates and cultured with the indicated growth medium. The cells were harvested after trypsinization, and the number of cells was counted using a Beckman Z2 coulter counter. Column Chromatography—For Protocol 1, cells were extracted with lysis buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin). After centrifugation, supernatants were filtered with a 0.45-μm filter unit and soaked with DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. Supernatants were subjected to an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences). Start buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) and elution buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) were used for chromatography. Samples were collected, and fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis. For Protocol 2, cells were extracted with lysis buffer C (1.2 m ammonium sulfate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin). After centrifugation, supernatants were filtered with a 0.45-μm filter unit and subjected to phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The fractionated samples were subjected to SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column chromatography as described above. Mass Spectrometry—For identification of p54, the silver-stained band on the SDS-PAGE gel was excised, and the gel piece was destained as described before (36Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The proteins in the gel were reduced, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin. The resultant peptides were extracted, desalted with StageTip (37Rappsilber J. Mann M. Ishihama Y. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1896-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar), and subjected to reversed-phase liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a high resolution hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific) with TOP10 method, as described previously (38Haas W.

J. Am. Soc. Mass Spec. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). Proteins were identified with at least two unique valid peptides, and the false discovery rate was estimated to be 0% using the target-decoy approach (41Elias J.E. Gygi S.P. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). For identification of CCTβ phosphorylation sites, overexpressed and immunoprecipitated FLAG-CCTβ was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The CCTβ in the gel was destained, reduced, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or lysyl endoprotease (Lys-C). The resultant peptides were extracted, desalted, and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using both collision-induced dissociation and electron transfer dissociation. The obtained data were searched against FLAG-CCTβ sequence using SEQUEST. All candidate MS/MS spectra were manually inspected, and site localization reliability was assessed by Ascore (42Beausoleil S.A. Villen J. Gerber S.A. Rush J. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Protein Phosphotransferase Assays—HA-RSK- or HA-S6K-transfected cells were lysed with buffer A containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. Beads were washed twice in the lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate), and kinase assays were performed as described previously (13Shahbazian D.

The reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and dried gel was autoradiographed. Identification of the Chaperonin CCT as a Downstream Target for RSK in the Ras-MAPK Pathway—To search for novel targets of RSK and S6K, we used the Phospho-Akt substrate antibody (αPAS, Cell Signaling), which detects the consensus motif, RXRXXpS/pT, often phosphorylated by basophilic AGC kinases such as Akt, RSK, and S6K (8Manning B.D.

Increased phosphorylation of additional proteins was also detected with this assay, including a molecular mass ∼54-kDa protein (Fig. 1). Overexpression of RSK1 or RSK2 increased p54 phosphorylation, whereas siRNA-mediated RNAi knockdown of RSK1, RSK2, or both isoforms decreased the phosphorylation, indicating that p54 was a potential RSK target (Fig. 1, supplemental Fig. S1A). The p54 protein was chromatographically purified from PMA-stimulated HEK293E cell lysates. Fractionation was conducted by ion exchange column chromatography alone (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2) or by a two-step purification with hydrophobic interaction chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography (supplemental Fig. S3). The p54 protein was followed with αPAS detection and identified as CCTβ by mass spectrometry. Endogenous CCTβ was immunoprecipitated and PMA-stimulated phosphorylation confirmed with αPAS (Fig. 1C). The chaperonin CCT is a hetero-oligomer of eight different subunits (44Miller E.J. Meyer A.S. Frydman J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1522-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Indeed, mass spectrometry identified several of the other subunits in the chromatographic fractions (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the chaperonin CCT is a novel downstream target for RSK. RSK Phosphorylates the CCTβ Subunit in Vivo and in Vitro—To further demonstrate that CCTβ is phosphorylated in a RSK-dependent manner, we treated cells with several pharmacological inhibitors. EGF- or PMA-induced endogenous or ectopic CCTβ phosphorylation was sensitive to the MEK inhibitor UO126 and a recently developed RSK pan inhibitor BI-D1870 (31Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sapkota G.P. Cummings L. Newell F.S. Armstrong C. Bain J. Frodin M. Grauert M. Hoffmann M. Schnapp G. Steegmaier M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R.

Overexpression of wild-type RSK1 or RSK2, but not kinase inactive RSK1 (K94/447R) or RSK2 (K100/541R), enhanced CCTβ phosphorylation (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1A). In addition, S6K1 overexpression did not significantly increase CCTβ phosphorylation in the presence of activated RSK, although a small increase in phosphorylation in unstimulated cells was noted. Furthermore, reduction of RSK1 and RSK2 with RNAi suppressed CCTβ phosphorylation by PMA, indicating the requirement of RSK phosphotransferase activity for phorbol ester-induced CCTβ phosphorylation in intact cells (Fig. 2C). To confirm that RSK phosphorylates CCTβ, we conducted in vitro kinase assays. Incorporation of radioactive phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP was seen in the sample containing both HA-tagged RSK1 and the purified FLAG-tagged CCTβ protein. In a similar experiment without radioactive ATP, CCTβ phosphorylation was confirmed by immunoblotting with αPAS (Fig. 2D). Taken together, our findings indicate that RSK phosphorylates CCTβ in vitro and is the major kinase responsible for CCTβ phosphorylation in EGF- or PMA-stimulated HEK293E cells. CCTβ Ser-260 Is the Phosphorylation Site Recognized by αPAS—To identify potential RSK phosphorylation sites, the immunoprecipitated FLAG-CCTβ was digested in-gel with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or Lys-C and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis equipped with both collision-induced dissociation and electron transfer dissociation. From the electron transfer dissociation spectrum of the Lys-C digestion, we identified phospho-Ser-260, which resides in an RXRXXS consensus sequence and which is conserved among higher eukaryotes (Fig. 3A and 7C). To confirm that RSK phosphorylates CCTβ Ser-260 in intact cells, we generated a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of CCTβ (Ser-260 → Ala). FLAG-CCTβ S260A was expressed in HEK293E cells, and phosphorylation was monitored. The αPAS antibody failed to detect phosphorylation of CCTβ S260A, indicating that phospho-Ser-260 is recognized by αPAS (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 7Localization of CCTβ Ser-260 at the tip of the apical domain constituting the built-in lid for the chaperonin CCT.

https://openalex.org/W2047497069,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone recently identified as a new endogenous pro-inflammatory hormone in human granulocytes. Here we report the functional activation of human monocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells by ABA. Incubation of monocytes with ABA evokes an intracellular Ca2+ rise through the second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose, leading to NF-kappaB activation and consequent increase of cyclooxygenase-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 production and enhanced release of MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and of metalloprotease-9, all events reportedly involved in atherogenesis. Moreover, monocytes release ABA when exposed to thrombin-activated platelets, a condition occurring at the injured vascular endothelium; monocyte-derived ABA behaves as an autocrine and paracrine pro-inflammatory hormone-stimulating monocyte migration and MCP-1 release, as well as vascular smooth muscle cells migration and proliferation. These results, and the presence of ABA in human arterial plaques at a 10-fold higher concentration compared with normal arterial tissue, identify ABA as a new signal molecule involved in the development of atherosclerosis and suggest a possible new target for anti-atherosclerotic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2101762577,"Oxidative damage contributes to loss of nervous system function in age as well as a result of degenerative disease. But how exactly can oxidation impair neuronal function? In the worm C. elegans, this study shows that the potassium channel KVS-1 is subject to oxidation at a particular cysteine residue. Mutation of this residue led to preservation of chemosensation in aging worms. Potassium channels are key regulators of neuronal excitability. Here we show that oxidation of the K+ channel KVS-1 during aging causes sensory function loss in Caenorhabditis elegans and that protection of this channel from oxidation preserves neuronal function. Chemotaxis, a function controlled by KVS-1, was significantly impaired in worms exposed to oxidizing agents, but only moderately affected in worms harboring an oxidation-resistant KVS-1 mutant (C113S). In aging C113S transgenic worms, the effects of free radical accumulation were significantly attenuated compared to those in wild type. Electrophysiological analyses showed that both reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation during aging and acute exposure to oxidizing agents acted primarily to alter the excitability of the neurons that mediate chemotaxis. Together, these findings establish a pivotal role for ROS-mediated oxidation of voltage-gated K+ channels in sensorial decline during aging in invertebrates."

The screens identified partially overlapping sets of compounds that were further characterized for affinity, mechanism, and efficacy in additional cellular processing assays. Dicoumarols were identified as a class of compounds that inhibited furin non-competitively and reversibly with Ki values in the micromolar range. These compounds inhibited furin/furin-like activity both at the cell surface (protecting against anthrax toxin) and in the secretory pathway (blocking processing of the metastasis factor membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase/MT1-MMP) at concentrations close to Ki values. Compounds tested exhibited distinct patterns of inhibition of other furin-family PCs (rat PACE4, human PC5/6 and human PC7), showing that dicoumarol derivatives might be developed as either generic or selective inhibitors of the PCs. The extensive clinical use, high bioavailability and relatively low toxicity of dicoumarols suggests that the dicoumarol structure will be a good starting point for development of drug-like inhibitors of furin and other PCs that can act both intracellularly and at the cell surface.

Even non-enveloped viruses, such as human papillomavirus, can require furin-type processing for entry into the cyotsol after endocytosis (22.Richards R.M. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. Day P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1522-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).The multiple roles for furin in human pathophysiology have made it a target of interest for development of therapeutic agents. Numerous protein- and peptide-based furin inhibitors have been devised (23.Fugere M. Day R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 294-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For the most part, these are not drug-like and their use as pharmaceutical agents is hampered by large size, instability, toxicity, and/or low cell permeability. Recently, 2,5-dideoxystreptamine derivatives have shown promise (24.Jiao G.S. Cregar L. Wang J. Millis S.Z. Tang C. O'Malley S. Johnson A.T. Sareth S. Larson J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19707-19712Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although these molecules have yet to be examined for inhibition of intracellular processing. Important pathophysiological roles exist for furin at the cell surface, such as in the processing of anthrax protective antigen. However, maturation of other bacterial toxins, viral envelope glycoproteins, and metalloprotease precursors such as membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a matrix metalloprotease whose activity contributes directly to degradation of extracellular matrix components and is important for angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis (25.Sato H. Takino T. Miyamori H. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), require processing by furin in the trans Golgi network and endosomal compartments (2.Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 26.Yana I. Weiss S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2387-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).Here we report identification of drug-like small molecule inhibitors through simultaneous high-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical diversity libraries with both enzyme-based and cell-based assays for furin and furin-like activities. A preliminary report of the cell-based assay has been published elsewhere (27.Coppola J.M. Hamilton C.A. Bhojani M.S. Larsen M.J. Ross B.D. Rehemtulla A. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 364: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Combining the results of the enzymatic screen with the cellular screen allowed identification of small molecule lead compounds with the desired properties of high affinity, high cell permeability, and low toxicity. Dicoumarols, which have an extensive pharmacological history (28.Borges F. Roleira F. Milhazes N. Santana L. Uriarte E. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 887-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), were identified in this study as a family of compounds that inhibited furin reversibly and non-competitively, also inhibited rat PACE4 (rPACE4), human PC5/6 (hPC5/6), and hPC7 and blocked both extracellular maturation of anthrax protective antigen (PA) and intracellular processing of MT1-MMP and other substrates.DISCUSSIONProprotein processing reactions provide potential targets of drug intervention for both chronic and infectious human disease (44.Fear G. Komarnytsky S. Raskin I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 113: 354-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because a large number of processing reactions are catalyzed by PCs, these enzymes have emerged as important potential drug targets (23.Fugere M. Day R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 294-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Drugs that are not cell-permeable may be effective in the case of extracellular processing events, such as maturation of anthrax protective antigen. More generally, however, small molecules with high bioavailability and cell permeability and exhibiting low toxicity are required to inhibit processing in intracellular compartments. Furin, PACE4, PC5/6, and PC7 all function in the constitutive secretory pathway, in the endocytic pathway, and/or at the cell surface and exhibit broad tissue distributions (2.Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Because of their similar patterns of substrate recognition and at least partial overlap in expression, it is currently unclear whether the goal of drug development targeting pathophysiological effects of furin or furin-like processing should be directed toward inhibitors exhibiting a high degree of discrimination between PC family members or toward more generic inhibitors that can block activities of all the PCs.Here we report the results of a high-throughput screen for small molecule inhibitors of furin/PCs that relied on simultaneous use of enzymatic and cellular assays. Use of the cell-based assay identified compounds that inhibited intracellular processing catalyzed by furin alone or by furin along with other PCs while eliminating compounds with substantial toxicity. Use of the enzymatic assay identified compounds that directly inhibited ssfurin. The combination of assays allowed us to focus on furin inhibitors that had high promise for intracellular inhibition. The combined screens identified a set of competitive inhibitors that were largely unrelated structurally and a set of non-competitive inhibitors, mostly from one structural family. Many of the competitive inhibitors were basic compounds that performed poorly due to higher toxicity or lower cell permeability when further cell-based assays were employed. We focused our efforts instead on the non-competitive inhibitors, all of which were structurally related or analogous to dicoumarol. Identification of these compounds as furin inhibitors is significant for several reasons. First, to our knowledge, no other non-competitive furin inhibitors have been described. Second, inhibition by several of these compounds (DC3, DC4, and DC9) was reversible, indicating that these molecules do not undergo nonspecific covalent reactions with ssfurin. Third, dicoumarols have an extensive history of use as pharmacological agents that makes them an attractive starting point for drug development.Dicoumarol (DC4) has been used clinically as an anticoagulant with vitamin K antagonist activity similar to that of warfarin (45.Lockner D. Paul C. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1979; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 46.Schulman S. Granqvist S. Holmstrom M. Carlsson A. Lindmarker P. Nicol P. Eklund S.G. Nordlander S. Larfars G. Leijd B. Linder O. Loogna E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 47.McAlister V. Clin. Investig. Med. 2006; 29: 373-377PubMed Google Scholar). A large number of dicoumarol derivatives have been synthesized and assessed for anticoagulant activity (48.Guminska M. Eckstein M. J. Med. Pharm. Chem. 1961; 3: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The use of dicoumarol as an oral anticoagulent is indicative of high bioavailability, low toxicity, and high cell permeability. Indeed, several dicoumarols examined here exhibited high cell permeability as the IC50 values for inhibition of intracellular processing (Fig. 6B) were quite close to the Ki values measured with purified ssfurin. Although the furin inhibitors identified in this screen exhibited Ki values in the micromolar range, their effective concentrations for inhibition of both cell surface and intracellular processing were also in the low micromolar range. Inhibition of intracellular processing reactions by other characterized furin inhibitors, including engineered proteins (20.Jean F. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Liu G. Jarvis M.A. Nelson J.A. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2864-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 49.Komiyama T. VanderLugt B. Fugere M. Day R. Kaufman R.J. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), has required inhibitor concentrations ranging from ∼1,000 to 10,000 × Ki. In contrast, IC50 values for inhibition of intracellular processing by DC1, DC2, and DC4 were ∼4 × Ki, 17 × Ki, and 1 × Ki, respectively (Figs. 2A and 6B). Moreover, IC50 values for previously characterized furin inhibitors when assayed in cell-surface processing reactions have also been high in comparison to Ki values: 210 × Ki for RRD-eglin (33.Komiyama T. Swanson J.A. Fuller R.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 3875-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), 120 × Ki for Ac-Arg-Glu-Lys-boroArg (33.Komiyama T. Swanson J.A. Fuller R.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 3875-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), 2800 × Ki for D9R (52.Kacprzak M.M. Peinado J.R. Than M.E. Appel J. Henrich S. Lipkind G. Houghten R.A. Bode W. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36788-36794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and 190–360 × Ki for 2,5-dideoxystrepatmine derivatives (24.Jiao G.S. Cregar L. Wang J. Millis S.Z. Tang C. O'Malley S. Johnson A.T. Sareth S. Larson J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19707-19712Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, IC50 values for inhibition of intracellular processing by DC1, DC2, and DC3 were <5 × Ki, 1 × Ki, and ∼2 × Ki, respectively (Figs. 2A and 6B). This remarkable efficiency of inhibition may be related to the ability of these compounds to inhibit both the intracellular and surface pools of processing enzymes.Although the therapeutic target of dicoumarols when used as anticoagulants is presumptively vitamin K epoxide reductase (53.Wallin R. Hutson S.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), another enzyme, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (DT diaphorase), has also been shown to be a high-affinity target (54.Asher G. Dym O. Tsvetkov P. Adler J. Shaul Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6372-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, dicoumarol has been reported to inhibit gap junction formation in cultured cells (55.Abdelmohsen K. Stuhlmann D. Daubrawa F. Klotz L.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and ADP-ribosylation of CtBP3/BARS, resulting in alterations in Golgi morphology and function (56.Mironov A.A. Colanzi A. Polishchuk R.S. Beznoussenko G.V. Mironov Jr., A.A. Fusella A. Di Tullio G. Silletta M.G. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Luini A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These effects may or may not influence the toxicity of dicoumarol but have not precluded clinical use.The PCs represent a new set of physiological targets for inhibition by dicoumarol and its derivatives. Because of the functional redundancy of the PCs, it is difficult to ascertain whether inhibition of processing in the individual cellular assays (processing of anthrax PA, CPA95, GRAPfurin, von Willebrand factor, or MT1-MMP) is due solely to inhibition of furin, inhibition of other PC family members or both. Nevertheless, our results suggest both that single compounds can inhibit multiple members of the PC family (Table 2) and that selectivity between enzymes can be achieved through modification of the dicoumarol structure (Fig. 2A).For several of the compounds tested, concentrations required for inhibition in cellular assays are similar to the therapeutic doses of dicoumarol, suggesting that affinities may be close to that needed for drug models. Nevertheless, because dicoumarols inhibit multiple target enzymes, optimization of compounds will be necessary. Dicoumarol represents a good platform for structural modification that might yield compounds with increased affinity for furin and other PCs. Increasing selectivity, both for individual PCs and for PCs versus other targets (e.g. vitamin K epoxide reductase and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase) should further reduce off-target effects. Production of higher affinity derivatives may also assist in identifying the dicoumarol binding site within furin and yield information regarding the molecular mechanism of non-competitive inhibition.

Even non-enveloped viruses, such as human papillomavirus, can require furin-type processing for entry into the cyotsol after endocytosis (22.Richards R.M. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. Day P.M. Proc. Natl.

The multiple roles for furin in human pathophysiology have made it a target of interest for development of therapeutic agents. Numerous protein- and peptide-based furin inhibitors have been devised (23.Fugere M. Day R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 294-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For the most part, these are not drug-like and their use as pharmaceutical agents is hampered by large size, instability, toxicity, and/or low cell permeability. Recently, 2,5-dideoxystreptamine derivatives have shown promise (24.Jiao G.S. Cregar L. Wang J. Millis S.Z. Tang C. O'Malley S. Johnson A.T. Sareth S. Larson J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19707-19712Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although these molecules have yet to be examined for inhibition of intracellular processing. Important pathophysiological roles exist for furin at the cell surface, such as in the processing of anthrax protective antigen. However, maturation of other bacterial toxins, viral envelope glycoproteins, and metalloprotease precursors such as membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a matrix metalloprotease whose activity contributes directly to degradation of extracellular matrix components and is important for angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis (25.Sato H. Takino T. Miyamori H. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), require processing by furin in the trans Golgi network and endosomal compartments (2.Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 26.Yana I. Weiss S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2387-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Here we report identification of drug-like small molecule inhibitors through simultaneous high-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical diversity libraries with both enzyme-based and cell-based assays for furin and furin-like activities. A preliminary report of the cell-based assay has been published elsewhere (27.Coppola J.M. Hamilton C.A. Bhojani M.S. Larsen M.J. Ross B.D. Rehemtulla A. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 364: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Combining the results of the enzymatic screen with the cellular screen allowed identification of small molecule lead compounds with the desired properties of high affinity, high cell permeability, and low toxicity. Dicoumarols, which have an extensive pharmacological history (28.Borges F. Roleira F. Milhazes N. Santana L. Uriarte E. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 887-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), were identified in this study as a family of compounds that inhibited furin reversibly and non-competitively, also inhibited rat PACE4 (rPACE4), human PC5/6 (hPC5/6), and hPC7 and blocked both extracellular maturation of anthrax protective antigen (PA) and intracellular processing of MT1-MMP and other substrates. DISCUSSIONProprotein processing reactions provide potential targets of drug intervention for both chronic and infectious human disease (44.Fear G. Komarnytsky S. Raskin I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 113: 354-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because a large number of processing reactions are catalyzed by PCs, these enzymes have emerged as important potential drug targets (23.Fugere M. Day R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 294-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Drugs that are not cell-permeable may be effective in the case of extracellular processing events, such as maturation of anthrax protective antigen. More generally, however, small molecules with high bioavailability and cell permeability and exhibiting low toxicity are required to inhibit processing in intracellular compartments. Furin, PACE4, PC5/6, and PC7 all function in the constitutive secretory pathway, in the endocytic pathway, and/or at the cell surface and exhibit broad tissue distributions (2.Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Because of their similar patterns of substrate recognition and at least partial overlap in expression, it is currently unclear whether the goal of drug development targeting pathophysiological effects of furin or furin-like processing should be directed toward inhibitors exhibiting a high degree of discrimination between PC family members or toward more generic inhibitors that can block activities of all the PCs.Here we report the results of a high-throughput screen for small molecule inhibitors of furin/PCs that relied on simultaneous use of enzymatic and cellular assays. Use of the cell-based assay identified compounds that inhibited intracellular processing catalyzed by furin alone or by furin along with other PCs while eliminating compounds with substantial toxicity. Use of the enzymatic assay identified compounds that directly inhibited ssfurin. The combination of assays allowed us to focus on furin inhibitors that had high promise for intracellular inhibition. The combined screens identified a set of competitive inhibitors that were largely unrelated structurally and a set of non-competitive inhibitors, mostly from one structural family. Many of the competitive inhibitors were basic compounds that performed poorly due to higher toxicity or lower cell permeability when further cell-based assays were employed. We focused our efforts instead on the non-competitive inhibitors, all of which were structurally related or analogous to dicoumarol. Identification of these compounds as furin inhibitors is significant for several reasons. First, to our knowledge, no other non-competitive furin inhibitors have been described. Second, inhibition by several of these compounds (DC3, DC4, and DC9) was reversible, indicating that these molecules do not undergo nonspecific covalent reactions with ssfurin. Third, dicoumarols have an extensive history of use as pharmacological agents that makes them an attractive starting point for drug development.Dicoumarol (DC4) has been used clinically as an anticoagulant with vitamin K antagonist activity similar to that of warfarin (45.Lockner D. Paul C. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1979; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 46.Schulman S. Granqvist S. Holmstrom M. Carlsson A. Lindmarker P. Nicol P. Eklund S.G. Nordlander S.

A large number of dicoumarol derivatives have been synthesized and assessed for anticoagulant activity (48.Guminska M. Eckstein M. J. Med. Pharm. Chem. 1961; 3: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The use of dicoumarol as an oral anticoagulent is indicative of high bioavailability, low toxicity, and high cell permeability. Indeed, several dicoumarols examined here exhibited high cell permeability as the IC50 values for inhibition of intracellular processing (Fig. 6B) were quite close to the Ki values measured with purified ssfurin. Although the furin inhibitors identified in this screen exhibited Ki values in the micromolar range, their effective concentrations for inhibition of both cell surface and intracellular processing were also in the low micromolar range. Inhibition of intracellular processing reactions by other characterized furin inhibitors, including engineered proteins (20.Jean F. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Liu G. Jarvis M.A. Nelson J.A. Thomas G.

Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), has required inhibitor concentrations ranging from ∼1,000 to 10,000 × Ki. In contrast, IC50 values for inhibition of intracellular processing by DC1, DC2, and DC4 were ∼4 × Ki, 17 × Ki, and 1 × Ki, respectively (Figs. 2A and 6B). Moreover, IC50 values for previously characterized furin inhibitors when assayed in cell-surface processing reactions have also been high in comparison to Ki values: 210 × Ki for RRD-eglin (33.Komiyama T. Swanson J.A. Fuller R.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 3875-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), 120 × Ki for Ac-Arg-Glu-Lys-boroArg (33.Komiyama T. Swanson J.A. Fuller R.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 3875-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), 2800 × Ki for D9R (52.Kacprzak M.M. Peinado J.R. Than M.E. Appel J. Henrich S. Lipkind G. Houghten R.A. Bode W. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36788-36794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and 190–360 × Ki for 2,5-dideoxystrepatmine derivatives (24.Jiao G.S.

In contrast, IC50 values for inhibition of intracellular processing by DC1, DC2, and DC3 were <5 × Ki, 1 × Ki, and ∼2 × Ki, respectively (Figs. 2A and 6B). This remarkable efficiency of inhibition may be related to the ability of these compounds to inhibit both the intracellular and surface pools of processing enzymes.Although the therapeutic target of dicoumarols when used as anticoagulants is presumptively vitamin K epoxide reductase (53.Wallin R. Hutson S.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), another enzyme, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (DT diaphorase), has also been shown to be a high-affinity target (54.Asher G. Dym O. Tsvetkov P. Adler J. Shaul Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6372-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, dicoumarol has been reported to inhibit gap junction formation in cultured cells (55.Abdelmohsen K. Stuhlmann D. Daubrawa F. Klotz L.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and ADP-ribosylation of CtBP3/BARS, resulting in alterations in Golgi morphology and function (56.Mironov A.A. Colanzi A. Polishchuk R.S. Beznoussenko G.V. Mironov Jr., A.A. Fusella A. Di Tullio G. Silletta M.G. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Luini A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These effects may or may not influence the toxicity of dicoumarol but have not precluded clinical use.The PCs represent a new set of physiological targets for inhibition by dicoumarol and its derivatives. Because of the functional redundancy of the PCs, it is difficult to ascertain whether inhibition of processing in the individual cellular assays (processing of anthrax PA, CPA95, GRAPfurin, von Willebrand factor, or MT1-MMP) is due solely to inhibition of furin, inhibition of other PC family members or both. Nevertheless, our results suggest both that single compounds can inhibit multiple members of the PC family (Table 2) and that selectivity between enzymes can be achieved through modification of the dicoumarol structure (Fig. 2A).For several of the compounds tested, concentrations required for inhibition in cellular assays are similar to the therapeutic doses of dicoumarol, suggesting that affinities may be close to that needed for drug models. Nevertheless, because dicoumarols inhibit multiple target enzymes, optimization of compounds will be necessary. Dicoumarol represents a good platform for structural modification that might yield compounds with increased affinity for furin and other PCs. Increasing selectivity, both for individual PCs and for PCs versus other targets (e.g. vitamin K epoxide reductase and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase) should further reduce off-target effects. Production of higher affinity derivatives may also assist in identifying the dicoumarol binding site within furin and yield information regarding the molecular mechanism of non-competitive inhibition. Proprotein processing reactions provide potential targets of drug intervention for both chronic and infectious human disease (44.Fear G. Komarnytsky S. Raskin I. Pharmacol.

https://openalex.org/W1972274803,"K-Ras mutations are characteristic of human lung adenocarcinomas and occur almost exclusively in smokers. In preclinical models, K-Ras mutations are necessary for tobacco carcinogen-driven lung tumorigenesis and are sufficient to cause lung adenocarcinomas in transgenic mice. Because these mutations confer resistance to commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapies and targeted agents, effective therapies that target K-Ras are needed. Inhibitors of mTOR such as rapamycin can prevent K-Ras-driven lung tumorigenesis and alter the proportion of cytotoxic and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, suggesting that lung-associated T cells might be important for tumorigenesis.Lung tumorigenesis was studied in three murine models that depend on mutant K-Ras; a tobacco carcinogen-driven model, a syngeneic inoculation model, and a transgenic model. Splenic and lung-associated T cells were studied using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Foxp3+ cells were depleted using rapamycin, an antibody, or genetic ablation.Exposure of A/J mice to a tobacco carcinogen tripled lung-associated Foxp3+ cells prior to tumor development. At clinically relevant concentrations, rapamycin prevented this induction and reduced lung tumors by 90%. In A/J mice inoculated with lung adenocarcinoma cells resistant to rapamycin, antibody-mediated depletion of Foxp3+ cells reduced lung tumorigenesis by 80%. Likewise, mutant K-Ras transgenic mice lacking Foxp3+ cells developed 75% fewer lung tumors than littermates with Foxp3+ cells.Foxp3+ regulatory T cells are required for K-Ras-mediated lung tumorigenesis in mice. These studies support clinical testing of rapamycin or other agents that target Treg in K-Ras driven human lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2021440169,"A key structural component of amyloid fibrils is a highly ordered, crystalline-like cross-β-sheet core. Conformationally different amyloid structures can be formed within the same amino acid sequence. It is generally assumed that individual fibrils consist of conformationally uniform cross-β-structures. Using mammalian recombinant prion protein (PrP), we showed that, contrary to common perception, amyloid is capable of accommodating a significant conformational switching within individual fibrils. The conformational switch occurred when the amino acid sequence of a PrP variant used as a precursor substrate in a fibrillation reaction was not compatible with the strain-specific conformation of the fibrillar template. Despite the mismatch in amino acid sequences between the substrate and template, individual fibrils recruited the heterologous PrP variant; however, the fibril elongation proceeded through a conformational adaptation, resulting in a change in amyloid strain within individual fibrils. This study illustrates the high adaptation potential of amyloid structures and suggests that conformational switching within individual fibrils may account for adaptation of amyloid strains to a heterologous substrate. This work proposes a new mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of strain conversion and illustrates the direction in evolution of amyloid structures. This study also provides a direct illustration that catalytic activity of self-replicating amyloid structures is not ultimately coupled with their templating effect."

The recombinant protease was purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants by fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation, batch adsorption to cation exchange material, and anion exchange chromatography. Purified SlSBT3 was identified as a 79-kDa glycoprotein with both complex and paucimannosidic type glycan chains at Asn(177), Asn(203), Asn(376), Asn(697), and Asn(745). SlSBT3 was found to be a very stable enzyme, being fully active at 60 degrees C and showing highest activity at alkaline conditions with a maximum between pH 7.5 and 8.0. Substrate specificity of SlSBT3 was analyzed in detail, revealing a preference for Gln and Lys in the P(1) and P(2) positions of oligopeptide substrates, respectively. Similar to bacterial, yeast, and mammalian subtilases, SlSBT3 is synthesized as a preproenzyme, and processing of the prodomain in the endoplasmic reticulum is a prerequisite for passage through the secretory pathway. SlSBT3 S538A and S538C active site mutants accumulated intracellularly as unprocessed zymogens, indicating that prodomain cleavage occurs autocatalytically. The wild-type SlSBT3 protein failed to cleave the prodomain of the S538A mutant in trans, demonstrating that zymogen maturation is an intramolecular process. Distinguishing features of plant as compared with mammalian subtilases include the insertion of a large protease-associated domain between the His and Ser residues of the catalytic triad and the C-terminal extension to the catalytic domain. Both features were found to be required for SlSBT3 activity and, consequently, for prodomain processing and secretion."

To learn whether protonated or deprotonated forms of guanine predominate in the active site, microscopic pKa values were determined for ionization of 8-azaguanosine substituted for G8 in the active site of a fully functional hairpin ribozyme in order to determine microscopic pKa values for 8-azaguanine deprotonation from the pH dependence of fluorescence. Microscopic pKa values above 9 for deprotonation of 8-azaguanine in the active site were about 3 units higher than apparent pKa values determined from the pH dependence of self-cleavage kinetics. Thus, the increase in activity with increasing pH does not correlate with deprotonation of G8, and most of G8 is protonated at neutral pH. These results do not exclude a role in proton transfer, but a simple interpretation is that G8 functions in the protonated form, perhaps by donating hydrogen bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2014848216,"Background Anandamide is a lipid neurotransmitter which belongs to a class of molecules termed the endocannabinoids involved in multiple physiological functions. Anandamide is readily taken up into cells, but there is considerable controversy as to the nature of this transport process (passive diffusion through the lipid bilayer vs. involvement of putative proteic transporters). This issue is of major importance since anandamide transport through the plasma membrane is crucial for its biological activity and intracellular degradation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the involvement of cholesterol in membrane uptake and transport of anandamide. Methodology/Principal Findings Molecular modeling simulations suggested that anandamide can adopt a shape that is remarkably complementary to cholesterol. Physicochemical studies showed that in the nanomolar concentration range, anandamide strongly interacted with cholesterol monolayers at the air-water interface. The specificity of this interaction was assessed by: i) the lack of activity of structurally related unsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid and arachidonic acid at 50 nM) on cholesterol monolayers, and ii) the weak insertion of anandamide into phosphatidylcholine or sphingomyelin monolayers. In agreement with these data, the presence of cholesterol in reconstituted planar lipid bilayers triggered the stable insertion of anandamide detected as an increase in bilayer capacitance. Kinetics transport studies showed that pure phosphatidylcholine bilayers were weakly permeable to anandamide. The incorporation of cholesterol in phosphatidylcholine bilayers dose-dependently stimulated the translocation of anandamide. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that cholesterol stimulates both the insertion of anandamide into synthetic lipid monolayers and bilayers, and its transport across bilayer membranes. In this respect, we suggest that besides putative anandamide protein-transporters, cholesterol could be an important component of the anandamide transport machinery. Finally, this study provides a mechanistic explanation for the key regulatory activity played by membrane cholesterol in the responsiveness of cells to anandamide."
https://openalex.org/W2125286987,"The cytoplasmic level of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is significantly correlated with the elevated expression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP), and high levels of both proteins are predictive of a poor prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We herein show that TP is highly induced by serum deprivation in NPC cells, and that this is due to an increase in the half-life of the TP mRNA, as shown by nuclear run-on and actinomycin D assays. We further show that the CU-rich element of the TP mRNA directly interacts with hnRNP K, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation RT-PCR assays, and the nucleus-to-cytoplasm translocation of hnRNP K. Blockade of hnRNP K expression reduces TP expression, suggesting that hnRNP K acts in the upregulation of TP. Mechanistically, both MEK inhibitor and the hnRNP K ERK-phosphoacceptor-site mutant decrease cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP K, suggesting that ERK-dependent phosphorylation is critical for TP induction. Furthermore, we found that hnRNP K-mediated TP induction allows NPC cells to resist hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Our results collectively establish the regulation and role of ERK-mediated cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP K as an upstream modulator of TP, suggesting that hnRNP K may be an attractive candidate as a future therapeutic target for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2033993988,"The BLM helicase associates with the telomere structural proteins TRF1 and TRF2 in immortalized cells using the alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) pathways. This work focuses on identifying protein partners of BLM in cells using ALT. Mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation techniques have identified three proteins that bind directly to BLM and TRF2 in ALT cells: telomerase-associated protein 1 (TEP1), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and topoisomerase IIα (TOPOIIα). BLM predominantly co-localizes with these proteins in foci actively synthesizing DNA during late S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle when ALT is thought to occur.

It is characterized by sun sensitivity, small stature, immunodeficiency, male infertility, and an increased susceptibility to cancer of all sites and types. The high incidence of spontaneous chromosome breakage and other unique chromosomal anomalies in cells from BS patients indicate an increase in homologous recombination in somatic cells (1German J. Dermatol. Clin. 1995; 13: 7-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another notable feature of non-immortalized and immortalized cells from BS individuals is the presence of telomeric associations (TAs) between homologous chromosomes (2German J. Crippa L.P. Ann. Genet. 1966; 9: 143-154Google Scholar). Work from our group and others have suggested a role for BLM in recombination-mediated mechanisms of telomere elongation or ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres), processes that maintain/elongate telomeres in the absence of telomerase (3Lundblad V. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1993; 73: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 4Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R.

However, the exact mechanism by which BLM contributes to telomere stability is unknown.Several proteins interact with and regulate BLM helicase activity, including two telomere-specific proteins, TRF1 and TRF2 (6Stavropoulos D.J. Bradshaw P.S. Li X. Pasic I. Truong K. Ikura M. Ungrin M. Meyn M.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3135-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Lillard-Wetherell K. Machwe A. Langland G.T.

Although TRF2 stimulates BLM unwinding of telomeric and non-telomeric 3′-overhang substrates, TRF1 inhibits BLM unwinding of telomeric substrates. TRF2-mediated stimulation of BLM helicase activity on a telomeric substrate is observed when TRF2 is present in excess or with equimolar amount of TRF1 but not when TRF1 is present in molar excess. Both proteins associate with BLM specifically in ALT cells in vivo, suggesting their involvement in the ALT pathways. In addition to TRF1 and TRF2, the telomere single-strand DNA-binding protein POT1 strongly stimulates BLM helicase activity on long telomeric forked duplexes and D-loop structures (8Opresko P.L. Mason P.A. Podell E.R. Lei M. Hickson I.D. Cech T.R. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32069-32080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Other proteins also play an important role in telomere maintenance in telomerase-negative cells, including RAD50, NBS1, and MRE11, which co-localize with TRF1 and TRF2 in specialized ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (APBs) (9Yeager T.R.

Thus, we hypothesize that BLM complex formation may be essential for the ALT mechanism, and its modification may occur dynamically during the specific nucleic acid transactions required to protect the telomere in cells using the ALT pathways.This study has identified previously unknown protein partners of BLM and TRF2 in ALT cells using double immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (MS). These include telomerase-associated protein 1 (TEP1), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and topoisomerase IIα (TOPOIIα). These proteins associate with BLM and TRF2 in cells using ALT but not in cells using telomerase and directly interact with BLM in vitro. This complex of proteins localizes to sites of new DNA synthesis in vivo in ALT cells, suggesting a role in telomere maintenance. We also identified HSP90 and TOPOIIα in another ALT-specific complex consisting of BLM, TRF1, and TRF2 but not TEP1. In vitro analyses demonstrate that HSP90 inhibits BLM helicase activity using both telomeric and non-telomeric substrates, whereas TEP1 and TOPOIIα initially slow the kinetics of BLM unwinding only using telomeric substrates. These findings suggest the presence of dynamic BLM-associated ALT complexes that include previously unidentified interacting proteins. The function of TEP1 in the BLM·TRF2 complex remains unclear, although its previously described interaction with the RNA subunit of telomerase (12Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O. Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) suggests an interesting hypothesis of cross-talk between mechanisms of telomere elongation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—Two immortalized and telomerase-negative cell lines, Saos2 and WI-38-VA13/2RA, two immortalized and telomerase-positive cell lines, MCF7 and HeLa, and a non-immortalized primary cell line of diploid human fibroblasts, WI-38, were obtained from ATCC. The SV-40 transformed BS fibroblast cell line GM08505C was obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository. MCF7, Saos2, and GM08505C cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). WI-38 and WI-38-VA13/2RA were cultured in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Cell Cycle Synchronization, Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Pulse Labeling, and Flow Cytometry—Cells were prepared for synchronization in G1/S phases as described previously (7Lillard-Wetherell K. Machwe A. Langland G.T. Combs K.A. Behbehani G.K. Schonberg S.A. German J. Turchi J.J. Orren D.K. Groden J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1919-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). BrdUrd pulse labeling (11Wu G. Lee W.H. Chen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30618-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and cell cycle analysis were performed on propidium iodide-labeled cells using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer.In Vivo Protein Coimmunoprecipitation—In vivo immunoprecipitations from nuclear extracts were performed as previously described (7Lillard-Wetherell K. Machwe A. Langland G.T. Combs K.A. Behbehani G.K. Schonberg S.A. German J. Turchi J.J. Orren D.K. Groden J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1919-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For double immunoprecipitations, the immunoprecipitates from the first round of immunoprecipitations were washed with lysis buffer and eluted with 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.0, followed by neutralization of the pH and the addition of the second antibody.MALDI-TOF and Protein Identification—SDS-gel sample bands were cut and submitted to the OSU Proteomics Core. Samples were transferred to the MassPrep station for automated in-gel protein digestion. Briefly, gel pieces were destained with ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile and reduced with dithiothreitol. The reducing mixture was removed, and iodoacetamide in ammonium bicarbonate was added and incubated 20 min at 37 °C. Alkylation solution was removed followed by washing with ammonium bicarbonate/water and dehydration with acetonitrile. In-gel digestion of the extracted proteins was carried out with 6-ng/μl trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 5 h at 37 °C. Digested peptides were extracted with a mixture of 1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile and applied onto a stainless steel MALDI plate (Micromass). Mass spectra of resulting peptides were recorded on the MALDI-TOF spectrometer in reflectron mode. Calibration was performed with angiotensin I (average molecular mass 1296.5 Da), renin (average molecular mass 1759.0 Da), and ACTH 18–39 clip (adenocorticotropic hormone clip 18–39, average molecular mass 2465.199 Da). The resulting peptides were matched with their corresponding proteins with ProFound by searching the non-redundant data base maintained at the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). At least six peptides were used to identify each protein within the band. The following parameters were used for the search at ProFound: taxa Homo sapiens complete modifications iodoacetamide (Cys), partial modification oxidation (M), allowed incomplete cleavages 1, monoisotopic masses, and a mass tolerance of 50 ppm.Immunostaining and Antibodies—Western blotting was done using standard procedures (7Lillard-Wetherell K. Machwe A. Langland G.T. Combs K.A. Behbehani G.K. Schonberg S.A. German J. Turchi J.J. Orren D.K. Groden J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1919-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purchased from Accurate Scientific (BrdUrd, OBT 0030), Bethyl Laboratories (BLM, A300-110A for immunoprecipitations and Western blots; TOPOIIα, A300-054A for immunoprecipitations and Western blots), Calbiochem (TOPOIIα, NA14 for immunofluorescence), Imgenex (TRF2, IMG-124A for immunofluorescence), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (HSP90, sc-1057; PML, PG-M3; TEP1, sc-13052). Secondary antibodies included fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, and rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).Transfection and Immunofluorescence—Cells were transfected with the pEGFP-BLM expression vector using Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturers' protocol. For the siRNA experiments pBLMsiRNA was generated by ligating DNA sequences corresponding to pre-validated siRNA sequences (Ambion) into the pSilencer 4.1 CMV puro expression vector (Ambion). Oligonucleotides containing siRNA sequences were synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA), purified by SDS-PAGE, and annealed before ligation (top strand, 5′-GATCCGGAAGTTGTATGCACTACCTTCAAGAGAGGTAGTGCATACAACTTCCTTA-3′; bottom strand, 5′-AGCTTAAGGAAGTTGTATGCACTACCTCTCTTGAAGGTAGTGCATACAACTTCCG-3′). DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation product and grown in LB plus ampicillin. All products were sequenced. For controls, the pSCsiRNA vector was used (Ambion). The cells were viewed using an Axiovert Zeiss microscope. Images were captured on a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera using AxioVision (Release 4.5) imaging software.Protein Purification—Jel1 yeast (protease deficient) were transformed with the pYES-BLM vector using the Bio 101 Systems yeast transformation protocol (Bio 101 Systems). Transformed colonies were selected on plates lacking uracil, and starter cultures were used to inoculate SD minimal base (plus -Ura dropout powder) containing 2% glucose. Cultures were grown to an A600 of 1.5–2.0 in an orbital shaker at 30 °C. Yeast cells were pelleted and resuspended in an equal volume of S.D. minimal base (plus -Ura dropout powder) containing 2% galactose and grown for an additional 20–24 h. Yeast were then pelleted, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1:500 mammalian protease inhibitors (Sigma), and lysed using a French press cell by applying 20,000 pounds/square inch. Lysates were bound to 1.0 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Novagen) charged with NiSO4 in binding buffer (buffer A + 50 mm imidazole) at 4 °C for 4 h. The protein-bound resin was applied to a column and washed with 50 ml of binding buffer, 2.5 ml of binding buffer + 70 mm imidazole (120 mm total) and eluted with 4.0 ml of binding buffer + 450 mm imidazole (500 mm total). The eluted protein was dialyzed in buffer Z (60 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 4 h and then snap-frozen in small aliquots using liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Purity was confirmed by staining with Biosafe Coomassie (Bio-Rad). The maximum velocity (Vmax) for the pure enzyme was determined to be 0.26362 fmol unwound per min, and the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) was 27.118 nm.Baculovirus containing Myc-tagged TEP1 was amplified and used to infect SF9 cells. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection, pelleted at 500 × g for 10 min, washed, and re-suspended in 30 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, protease inhibitor (Sigma, P8340). Cells were sonicated 3 × 10 s and incubated with DNase 1 for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysate was clarified at 20,000 × g for 30 min and bound to agarose-conjugated anti-Myc antibodies (1-ml bed volume) for 4 h. A chromatography column (Bio-Rad, 731-1550) was packed with lysate and washed with 2 × 10 ml of PBS. Myc-tagged TEP1 was eluted with 7 × 1 ml of 100 mm NH4OH. Fractions containing TEP1 were dialyzed into buffer containing 60 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Protein purity was ascertained by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1). TEP1 cDNA was sequenced, and 8 individual base pair discrepancies were found by comparison to an NCBI published sequence (nucleotides 346, 1658, 1860, 2733, 3163, 3210, 3464, and 3583). These discrepancies were confirmed by sequencing a set of human genomic DNAs. Two alterations, at 3163 and 3583, are polymorphic, whereas the others remain unclear in origin or effect. Topoisomerase IIα was obtained from United States Biochemicals; HSP90 was a generous gift from Dr. David Toft, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, and pure UvrD helicase was a gift from Dr. Tim Lohman, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay Detection for Protein-Protein Interaction—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted as described previously (7Lillard-Wetherell K. Machwe A. Langland G.T. Combs K.A. Behbehani G.K. Schonberg S.A. German J. Turchi J.J. Orren D.K. Groden J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1919-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, wells were coated with 50 μl of purified BLM protein (diluted to 2.5 ng/μl in carbonate buffer) or with 50 μl of BSA as a background control and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed and incubated with 300 μl of blocking buffer (PBS, 3% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at 37 °C. After blocking, various concentrations of proteins were added (50 μl) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, primary antibody (1:1000) was added (50 μl) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed, and secondary antibody (1:10,000) was added (50 μl) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with 50 μl of TACS-sapphire detection reagent (Trevigen, Inc.) for 10 min in the dark. Reactions were stopped by adding equal volumes of 0.2 n HCl. Absorbance was read at 490 nm, and all values were corrected for background in reactions without primary and secondary antibodies.DNA Substrate—The telomeric 3′-overhang substrate was generated by annealing a 38-mer (5′-CCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAGAGGGAAAGGAAGAA-3′) with a 68-mer (5′-TTCTTCCTTTCCCTCTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG-3′). The non-telomeric 3′-overhang substrate was created by annealing a 38-mer (5′-ATGAGAAGCAGCCGTATCAGGAAGAGGGAAAGGAAGAA-3′) with a 68-mer (5′-TTCTTCCTTTCCCTCTTCCTGATACGGCTGCTTCTCATCTACAACGTGATCCGTCATTCGGAGTG-3′). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were purified using denaturing polyacrylamide gels before use. The shorter of the two strands was end-labeled with γ-32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The labeled strand was mixed at equimolar concentrations with the unlabeled complement, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and slowly cooled to room temperature to generate the partial double-stranded DNA.Helicase Assays—Helicase assays were performed as described (7Lillard-Wetherell K. Machwe A. Langland G.T. Combs K.A. Behbehani G.K. Schonberg S.A. German J. Turchi J.J. Orren D.K. Groden J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1919-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with some modifications. These assays measure the unwinding of 32P-labeled DNA from a partial duplex DNA molecule. In a 50-μl reaction volume, the DNA substrate (0.5 nm) was incubated with BLM in 1× helicase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C. In reactions containing additional proteins, the substrate was preincubated with these proteins for 5 min before adding BLM. Reactions were terminated after the desired time with helicase stop buffer (30% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol). The reaction products were separated, resolved by 12% native PAGE, and analyzed using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. All assays were performed at least three times.Telomere Restriction Fragment Length Analysis—Genomic DNA was isolated using the Genomic DNA Isolation kit (Trevigen). Briefly, 10 μg of DNA was digested with RsaI and HinfI overnight at 37 °C. Digested DNA was electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel in 1× Tris-buffered EDTA and transferred overnight to a positively charged nylon membrane (Immobilon-NY+). DNA was cross-linked to the membrane by Stratalinker, and southern hybridization was performed using a γ-32P-labeled telomere-specific probe (CCCTAAA)3. Blots were hybridized in 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's solution, 40% formamide, 0.5% SDS overnight at 42 °C, washed 3 times for 15 min in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and exposed to Biomax MS autoradiographic film for 2 days at -80 °C.RESULTSIdentification of Three Protein Partners of BLM in a BLM-associated ALT Complex—BLM is expressed in all tissues with active cell proliferation. Its expression peaks during late S and the G2 phases of the cell cycle, when ALT is thought to occur (13Dutertre S. Ababou M. Onclercq R. Delic J. Chatton B. Jaulin C. Amor-Gueret M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). BLM is capable of resolving stalled replication forks and is part of a multiprotein complex formed dynamically during replication (14Karow J.K. Constantinou A. Li J.L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc.

These observations prompted our attempts to isolate a BLM·TRF2 complex from ALT cells using double immunoprecipitation and MS techniques. Whole cell lysates were prepared from immortalized cell lines using ALT (Saos2 and VA13) or telomerase (HeLa and MCF7) to maintain telomeres and BS cell line GMO8505C. Antibodies specific for both BLM and TRF2 were used to enrich for BLM complexes, which were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and evaluated by silver staining (Fig. 1). Unique protein bands and those expressed in higher amounts in ALT cells compared with telomerase-positive cells were selected for identification by MS analysis. In total, five proteins were identified that included BLM, TOPOIIα, TEP1, and HSP90. The presence of each protein in the complex was validated by immunoprecipitation and Western analysis of lysates from the ALT and telomerase cells (Fig. 2A). Antibodies specific for TEP1, TOPOIIα, and HSP90 were used to detect the presence of each protein in the immunocomplex. The Western blot results demonstrate the above three proteins in significant amounts in immunoprecipitates from ALT cells in comparison to those from telomerase-positive cells (Fig. 2A, a–c). They were undetected in IgG controls, indicating that the pulldown assays were specific for the antibodies used.FIGURE 2Detection of BLM and TRF2-associated proteins by Western analysis. A, BLM and TRF2 were coimmunoprecipitated sequentially from nuclear extracts of ALT (WI38-VA13 and Saos2) and telomerase-positive (HeLa and MCF7) or BS cells (GM08508) (panels a–c). Immunoprecipitations (IP) were carried out with goat polyclonal BLM and TRF2 antibodies or normal goat IgG (negative control). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, Western-blotted with anti-TEP1 (a), anti-TOPOIIα (b), and anti-HSP90 (c) antibodies. TEP1 (d), TOPOIIα (e), and HSP90 (f) were also immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of Saos2 and MCF7 cells, resolved, and probed with anti-BLM and anti-TRF2. IgG controls and the inputs are also shown. B, TRF1 associates with BLM and TRF2. BLM·TRF2 immunocomplex from Saos2 and MCF7 were subjected to Western analysis using anti-TRF1 antibody. TRF1 immunoprecipitated from the ALT cell line Saos2. BLM was detected in the immunocomplex from both cell lines, whereas TRF2 was present in complex with BLM and TRF1 in Saos2. C, TEP1 is not a component of the ALT complex containing TRF1. Whole cell lysates from Saos2 and MCF7 were subjected to sequential immunoprecipitation using anti-BLM and anti-TRF1 antibodies. HSP90, TOPOIIα, and TRF2 were detected in complex with BLM and TRF2 in Saos2 but not in MCF7. TEP1 was not included in this specific complex in either cell line. The Input lanes show the presence of the proteins in whole cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Single immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-TEP1, anti-TOPOIIα, and anti-HSP90 antibodies (Fig. 2A, d–f). The immunocomplexes with anti-TEP1, anti-HSP90, and anti-TOPOIIα were resolved by denaturing SDS-PAGE as before. Western analysis confirmed the coimmunoprecipitation of BLM and TRF2 with TEP1, TOPOIIα, and HSP90 in ALT cell lysates only. We repeated these experiments with another ALT (VA13) and telomerase cell line (HeLa) (data not shown) at least three times to ascertain reproducibility. In all immunoprecipitation experiments, nuclear extracts were pretreated with micrococcal nuclease, suggesting that DNA tethering is not required for the interactions between these proteins (data not shown).As both TRF1 and TRF2 are telomere-specific proteins binding to telomere repeats, it was important to determine whether TRF1 was also present in the same complex with BLM and TRF2. Western analysis of the immunoprecipitates from the ALT (Saos2) and telomerase-positive cells (MCF7) showed that TRF1 was present in the BLM·TRF2 immunocomplex from the ALT cells but not in the telomerase-positive cells (Fig. 2B). The presence of overlapping bands/signals in the gel most likely prevented detection by MS analysis. These results were confirmed using different ALT and telomerase cells lines (data not shown). BLM was immunoprecipitated from both cell lines as indicated by Western blot, but TRF2 was only present in a complex with BLM and TRF1 in Saos2 lysates.Next, to determine the specificity of the complex, we performed double immunoprecipitation using anti-BLM and anti-TRF1 antibodies and immunoprecipitated the BLM-TRF1 immunocomplex from the ALT and telomerase-positive cells (Fig. 2C). The previously identified HSP90 and TOPOIIα were detected along with TRF2 in the complex by Western analysis; however, we were unable to detect TEP1 in this specific complex. This experiment was repeated several times using a different ALT cell line (VA13) with similar negative results. To rule out any effects of antibody specificity, anti-TEP1 and anti-TRF1 were used for immunoprecipitation, and the anti-BLM was used for Western analyses; similar negative results were generated (data not shown). These complexed proteins were undetected in MCF7. These data suggest a dynamic nature of the interactions between BLM, TRF1, and TRF2.BLM-associated Proteins Co-localize with BLM and TRF2 in Vivo—Immunofluorescence studies were performed to determine whether the three proteins identified by immunoprecipitation and MS co-localize with BLM and TRF2 in ALT cells. As TRF2 is a telomere-specific protein that associates with BLM in ALT cells (6Stavropoulos D.J. Bradshaw P.S. Li X. Pasic I. Truong K. Ikura M. Ungrin M. Meyn M.S. Hum. Mol.

ALT and telomerase cells were grown in a 6-well plate to 60% confluency and fixed for immunofluorescence. All three proteins, TEP1, TOPOIIα, and HSP90, co-localize with BLM in two different ALT cell lines tested, Saos2 (Fig. 3A) and VA13/2RA (data not shown), as indicated by the merger of the individual red and green foci to form distinct yellow foci. Similarly, these proteins also co-localize with TRF2 in the ALT cell lines Saos2 (Fig. 3B) and VA13 (data not shown). Strong co-localization was not observed in the telomerase-positive cell lines MCF7 (Fig. 3, A and B) and HeLa, or in the primary fibroblast cell line WI-38 (data not shown). The immunofluorescence data were quantified by determining the number of cells with co-localized foci in ALT and telomerase-positive cells (Fig. 3C). Results suggest a significant number of cells with co-localized foci in the ALT"

These signaling pathways can be regulated through reversible tyrosine phosphorylation events. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of junctional proteins reflects the balance between protein-tyrosine kinase and protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. The receptor-tyrosine phosphatase DEP-1 (CD148/PTP-η) has been implicated in cell growth and differentiation as well as in regulating phosphorylation of junctional proteins. However, the role of DEP-1 in regulating tight junction phosphorylation and the integrity of cell-cell junctions is still under investigation. In this study, we used a catalytically dead substrate-trapping mutant of DEP-1 to identify potential substrates at cell-cell junctions. We have shown that in epithelial cells the trapping mutant of DEP-1 interacts with the tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. In contrast, PTP-PEST, Shp2, and PTPμ did not interact with these proteins, suggesting that the interaction of DEP-1 with occludin and ZO-1 is specific. In addition, occludin and ZO-1 were dephosphorylated by DEP-1 but not these other phosphatases in vitro. Overexpression of DEP-1 increased barrier function as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance and also reduced paracellular flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran following a calcium switch. Reduced DEP-1 expression by small interfering RNA had a small but significant increase in junction permeability. These data suggest that DEP-1 can modify the phosphorylation state of tight junction proteins and play a role in regulating permeability.

Tight junctions are the most apical of junctions formed by epithelia and provide a regulated barrier to paracellular transport of ions, solutes, macromolecules, and even other cells. In addition, tight junctions act as a “fence” within the plane of the membrane, dividing the apical and basolateral domains of polarized epithelial cells. These junctions play an important role in the regulation of multiple cellular processes including cell differentiation, proliferation, and polarity (for reviews see Refs. 1Tsukita S. Furuse M.

Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Functional tight junctions are characterized by the presence of membrane spanning proteins (claudins, occludin, and JAMs), which interact with cytoplasmic proteins (AF-6 and ZO-1, -2, -3), regulating assembly and maintenance of tight junctions. Occludin spans the membrane four times and was the first transmembrane component of the tight junction to be identified (3Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). It has two extracellular regions, an intracellular loop, as well as both an N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (3Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J.

The C-terminal tail of occludin binds directly to the ZO family of proteins, which link the protein complex to the actin cytoskeleton (4Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol.

In fact, several kinases and phosphatases interact with and modulate the phosphorylation state of tight junction proteins (10Andreeva A.Y. Krause E. Muller E.-C. Blasig I.E. Utepbergenov D.I. J.

Serine and threonine phosphorylation of occludin is abundant in epithelia with intact junctions, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation is undetectable (15Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4347-4356PubMed Google Scholar). Increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1 result in the dissociation of the occludin-ZO-1 complex and reduces the localization at the tight junction of these proteins (12Kale G. Naren A.P. Sheth P. Rao R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 19Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky Jr., K. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the phosphorylation state of tight junction proteins can affect the integrity of the tight junction complex and therefore the integrity of the tight junction itself. Both serine and threonine kinases and phosphatases bind to and act on TJ proteins (reviewed in Ref. 20González-Mariscal L. Tapia R. Chamorro D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 729-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified that c-Src and c-Yes are protein-tyrosine kinases, which act on the TJ, however, to date no protein-tyrosine phosphatases have been specifically characterized as acting on TJ proteins (11Chen Y.-H. Lu Q. Goodenough D.A. Jeansonne B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Kale G. Naren A.P. Sheth P. Rao R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Similarly, the other major junction of epithelia, the adherens junction (AJ), is also regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the AJ decreases the stability of the cadherin-catenin complex, disrupting the association with the cytoskeleton and reducing junctional integrity (22Behrens J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Therefore, these studies suggest that maintenance of junctional integrity for both the TJ and AJ is regulated in part by reversible tyrosine phosphorylation that results from a competing balance of protein-tyrosine kinase and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity. Several PTPs have been localized to AJs and shown to bind components of the cadherin-catenin complex. The PTPs in AJs include receptor-PTPs (PTPμ, DEP-1, and vascular endothelial-PTP), as well as cytosolic PTPs (PTP1B and Shp-2) (25Balsamo J. Leung T. Ernst H. Zanin M.K. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J.

The high concentration of PTPs at cell-cell junctions indicates the importance of maintaining low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation except when the junctions need to be remodeled or disassembled. DEP-1 (density-enhanced phosphatase-1) is a receptor PTP that was first cloned from a human cDNA library and named based on the observation that its expression was elevated with increasing cell density (31Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Also known as PTP-η, PTPRJ, and CD148, DEP-1 is comprised of an extracellular domain of eight fibronectin type III repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a single cytoplasmic catalytic domain. The protein is ubiquitously expressed (32Borges L.G. Seifert R.A. Grant F.J. Hart C.E. Disteche C.M. Edelhoff S. Solca F.F. Lieberman M.A. Lindner V. Fischer E.H. Lok S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Circ.

DEP-1 is involved in regulating the differentiation of epithelial cells (33Keane M.M. Lowrey G.A. Ettenberg S.A. Dayton M.A. Lipkowitz S.

In addition, DEP-1 is able to attenuate the cellular response to growth factors through the preferential dephosphorylation of several growth factor receptors, suggesting that DEP-1 can selectively dephosphorylate certain tyrosines to more finely control signaling (37Grazia Lampugnani M.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in proliferation and differentiation, DEP-1 localizes to areas of cell-cell adhesion in endothelial and epithelial cells, overlapping with the AJ marker vascular endothelial-cadherin in endothelia (42Takahashi T. Takahashi K. Mernaugh R. Drozdoff V. Sipe C. Schoecklmann H. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Daniel T.O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2135-2145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction with p120 catenin as well as other members of the catenin family also supports the hypothesis that DEP-1 plays a role in regulating AJ protein phosphorylation (27Holsinger L. Ward K. Duffield B. Zachwieja J. Jallal B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7067-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Palka H.L. Park M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol.

In the current study, we investigated whether adjacent tight junction proteins are also substrates of DEP-1. We now demonstrate that the substrate-trapping mutant of DEP-1 interacts with the tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. The association of DEP-1 with occludin and ZO-1 is specific to DEP-1 and not other phosphatases tested. In addition, DEP-1 is able to dephosphorylate occludin and ZO-1 indicating that these tight junction proteins are substrates of DEP-1. Furthermore, increased expression of DEP-1 enhances barrier function as junctions reform following a calcium switch and loss of DEP-1 levels increased the permeability of a stable epithelial monolayer. Together these results indicate that ZO-1 and occludin are substrates of DEP-1 and imply a role for DEP-1 in influencing the phosphorylation state of tight junction proteins and junction permeability. MCF10A cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 0.01 mg/ml insulin, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin and antibiotics. MDCK II, A431, and HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA interference oligos were transfected using TransIT-siQUEST (Mirus). pMT2 DEP-1 WT, pMT2 DEP-1 D/A, and pMT2 DEP-1 C/S (GenBank™ accession number U10886) were kindly provided by Nicholas Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). GFP DEP-1 WT was generated by subcloning the pMT2 construct into pEGFP-N2 (Clontech). DEP-1 cytoplasmic domain constructs were generated using the pMT2 DEP-1 wild type, D1205A, or C1239S point mutants as templates. A 5′ primer introduced an EcoRI site before the DEP-1 cytoplasmic sequence at nucleotide 3338 and a 3′ primer introduced a XhoI site after the DEP-1 stop codon. The resulting PCR fragments (nucleotides 3338–4362) were cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare), creating wild type and point mutants D1205A and C1239S pGEX-DEP-1 constructs. GST-PTP-PEST wild type and the substrate-trapping mutant were obtained from Dr. Sarita Sastry (University of Texas, Galveston, TX), and GST-PTPμ wild type and substrate-trapping mutant were kind gifts from Dr. Susann Brady-Kalnay (Case Western). Full-length occludin was provided by Alan Fanning (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). For adenovirus, the full-length cDNA of DEP-1 WT or DEP-1 D/A was cloned into pENTR1D (Invitrogen). The entry clone was recombined with the pAd/CMV/V5 destination vector via LR clonase II. The Vira-Power Adenviral expression vector (Invitrogen) was linearized and then transfected into 293A cells via Lipofectamine 2000 to generate adenovirus encoding V5-tagged DEP-1 WT and DEP-1 D/A. The virus particles were used to infect MDCK II cells. RNA interference oligos were ON-TARGET-plus SMARTpool siRNA for DEP-1 or ON-TARGETplus Control siRNA 1 (Dharmacon).

Bacterial cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the fusion proteins were purified by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. Catalytic activity of the fusion proteins was checked by PTP activity assays using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). MCF10A cells were either left untreated or treated with 100 μm pervanadate (phosphatase inhibitor) for 15 min prior to lysis. Cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. MCF10A lysates (1 mg) were incubated with 10 μg of GST proteins for 1 h at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. Beads were washed in the modified RIPA buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). To determine whether the substrates were binding DEP-1 D/A at the PTP active site, we tested the effect of orthovanadate on complex formation. GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose were preincubated in a Hepes lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2), with or without 2 mm orthovanadate. MCF10A cells were treated with 100 μm pervanadate for 15 min and also lysed in Hepes lysis buffer with or without 2 mm orthovanadate. Lysates (500 μg to 1 mg) were incubated with 2 μg of GST-DEP-1 or GST-DEP-1 D/A for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed in the Hepes lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Because ZO-1 interaction was difficult to detect with low concentrations of recombinant DEP-1 D/A, 50 μg of GST-DEP-1 D/A was incubated with lysates prepared with or without 10 mm orthovanadate for 1.5 h at 4 °C to efficiently compete for the substrate binding. MCF10A cells were treated with 100 μm pervanadate for 15 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in the modified RIPA buffer plus 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm iodoacetic acid. After incubation of the lysates on ice for 10 min, dithiothreitol was added at a final concentration of 10 mm for another 10 min on ice to inactivate the iodoacetic acid. Lysates were clarified and 500 μg of total cell lysate was incubated with 1 μg of glutathione-Sepharose bound GST-PTPs for 20 min at room temperature. The phosphatases were removed by centrifugation, orthovanadate was added to the samples, and occludin or ZO-1 was immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed in the lysis buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE. The immune complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using PY-20 antibody, occludin monoclonal antibody, or ZO-1 polyclonal antibody. Alternatively, HEK 293 cells were transfected with occludin and the pMT2.DEP-1 constructs for 48 h and lysed directly in hot 2× SDS gel sample buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), and boiled for 10 min. Samples were then diluted 20-fold with phospho-IP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS. One μg of occludin antibody and protein G-Sepharose were added and samples were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Samples were then washed in Tris-buffered saline and analyzed by Western blot using anti-PY20 antibody. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with an antibody to occludin for a loading control. For ZO-1 in vivo dephosphorylation, A431 cells were transfected with pMT2 constructs for empty vector, wild type, and DEP-1 C/S mutant. Cells were serum starved in DMEM + 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 4 h and EGF was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml for varying times. Following treatment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the modified RIPA buffer containing 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. ZO-1 was immunoprecipitated overnight from lysates using a rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were washed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with PY-20 antibody and reprobed with the ZO-1 polyclonal antibody for loading control. MDCK II cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100. Occludin was visualized with anti-occludin monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 1:200 for 45 min at 37 °C followed by an anti-mouse Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody. Images were recorded with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. MDCK II cells were plated at confluent density (∼4 × 105 cells/cm2) onto Transwell filters (0.4 μm pore, 12-mm diameter; Corning). Growth media was removed from cells 3–4 h after plating and replaced with DMEM containing low calcium (5 μm) overnight (∼16 h). Disruption of cell-cell junctions was confirmed by TER measurements of only 2 ohms/cm2. Junction reassembly was induced with the addition of calcium containing DMEM (1.8 mm CaCl2) for the indicated length of time. TER—MDCK II cells were infected with pAd/CMV/GFP, pAd/CMV/V5-DEP-1 WT, or pAd/CMV/V5-DEP-1 D/A. 24 h later, cells were plated at confluent density (∼4 × 105 cells/cm2) onto Transwell filters (0.4 μm pore, 12-mm diameter; Corning) and cultured for 4 days, with media replacement daily. TER was measured using an Endohm-12 Transwell chamber connected to an EVOM voltohmeter (World Precision) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For calcium switch experiments, TER was measured at the indicated time points following re-addition of calcium containing media. The resistance of the filter was subtracted from all readings. FITC-Dextran Flux—MDCK II cells were infected with DEP-1 WT, DEP-1 D/A, or GFP control adenovirus and plated the same as for the TER measurements above. For the calcium switch, calcium containing DMEM was added to the chambers for the indicated length of time; 1 ml in the outer chamber and 250 μl in the inner chamber. 10-kDa FITC-dextran (Molecular Probes) was added to the top chamber in a volume of 50 μl at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. After 1 h, a sample was removed from the basolateral (bottom) compartments and read in a fluorometer (FluroStar Optima, BMG LABTECH) (excitation 485 nm, emission 520 nm). MCF10A cells were transfected with siRNA oligos at a final concentration of 25 nm for 72 h and lysed in the modified RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors. Alternatively, cells were transfected and 24 h later plated on Transwell filters (0.4 μm pore, 12 mm diameter; Corning) for an additional 48 h and TER was measured. Comparison between two groups was made by the Student's t test for unpaired data. Comparisons of the means of the more than two groups were made by single factor analysis of variance followed by the Fisher's LSD post hoc test. Identification of DEP-1 Substrates at the Tight Junction—Tyrosine phosphorylation of AJ proteins compromises the integrity of the cadherin-catenin complex as well as the junctional integrity of cell monolayers (22Behrens J.

Tight junction proteins can also be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation and we sought to identify whether tight junction proteins are potential substrates of the phosphatase DEP-1. To accomplish this, we used a substrate-trapping mutant of DEP-1 in which the conserved aspartic acid in the WPD loop of the catalytic domain is mutated to an alanine (D1205A), which traps the substrate within the catalytic domain of the phosphatase (43Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic domains of DEP-1 wild type (DEP-1 WT) and the substrate-trapping mutant (DEP-1 D/A) were expressed as GST fusion proteins and used in pulldown assays to identify potential physiological substrates of DEP-1. MCF10A cells were treated with pervanadate to generate a pool of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. As seen in Fig. 1A, only the substrate-trapping mutant (DEP-1 D/A) was able to bind to phosphorylated proteins. Interestingly, we noticed a band at ∼64 kDa that is able to bind DEP D/A without the addition of pervanadate. It is possible that this protein is the 64-kDa serine/threonine kinase found constitutive"
https://openalex.org/W2040680836,"Inhibitor of DNA-binding (Id) proteins prevent cell differentiation, promote growth and sustain tumour development. They do so by binding to E proteins and other transcription factors through the helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, and inhibiting transcription. This makes HLH-mediated Id protein interactions an appealing therapeutic target. We have used the dominant interfering HLH dimerization mutant 13I to model the impact of Id inhibition in two human neuroblastoma cell lines: LA-N-5, similar to immature neuroblasts, and SH-EP, resembling more immature precursor cells. We have validated 13I as an Id inhibitor by showing that it selectively binds to Ids, impairs complex formation with RB, and relieves repression of E protein-activated transcription. Id inactivation by 13I enhances LA-N-5 neural features and causes SH-EP cells to acquire neuronal morphology, express neuronal proteins such as N-CAM and NF-160, proliferate more slowly, and become responsive to retinoic acid. Concomitantly, 13I augments the cell-cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) and reduces the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor. These effects are Id specific, being counteracted by Id overexpression. Furthermore, 13I strongly impairs tumorigenic properties in agar colony formation and cell invasion assays. Targeting Id dimerization may therefore be effective for triggering differentiation and restraining neuroblastoma cell tumorigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2162191208,"Despite serious health risks in humans and wild life, the underlying mechanisms that explain the gene-environment effects of chemical toxicants are largely unknown. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are one of the most ubiquitous environmental toxicants worldwide, with reported epidemiological evidence for reproductive and neurocognitive anomalies in humans. Here, we show that Aroclor 1254, a mixture of structurally distinct PCBs, causes preterm birth in interleukin (IL)-10(-/-) mice at a dose that does not show any adverse effects in wild type mice, highlighting the significance of IL-10 as an anti-toxicant cytokine. Aroclor 1254-treated IL-10(-/-) mice demonstrated increased amniotic fluid, intrauterine growth restriction, and reduced litter size with postnatal neuromotor defects. Further, our results identify aquaporin 1 (AQP1), a potent effector of fluid volume regulation and angiogenic activity, as a novel placental target of PCBs. In vivo or in vitro exposure to Aroclor 1254 coupled with IL-10 deficiency significantly reduced the protein content of AQP1. Reduced uterine AQP1 levels were associated with defective spiral artery transformation. Importantly, recombinant IL-10 reversed PCB-induced in vivo and in vitro effects. These data demonstrate for the first time that the IL-10-AQP1 axis is a novel regulator of PCB-induced in utero effects."
https://openalex.org/W1974974777,"Background Specific interactions between sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol (Ch) are commonly believed to play a key role in the formation of rafts in the biological membranes. A weakness of this model is the implication that these microdomains are confined to the outer bilayer leaflet. The cytoplasmic leaflet, which contains the bulk of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), is thought also to harbour half of the membrane cholesterol. Moreover, SLPE (1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine) has recently been shown to be enriched in isolated detergent-resistant membranes (DRM), and this enrichment was independent of the method of isolation of DRM. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we present quantitative evidence coming from Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer experiments that SLPE forms complex with Ch similar to that between SM and Ch. The energies of these interactions as calculated form the monolayer studies are highly negative. FRAP analysis showed that NBD-Ch recovery was similar in liposomes composed of DOPC/Ch SM or SLPE but not DPPE, providing further evidence that SLPE may form an lo phase in the presence of high Ch concentration. Experiments on the solubility of DOPC liposomes containing DPPE/Ch (1∶1), SM/Ch (1∶1) or SLPE/Ch (1∶1) showed the presence of Triton X-100 insoluble floating fraction (TIFF) in the case of SM/Ch or SLPE/Ch but not in DPPE/Ch containing liposomes. Quantitative determination of particular lipid species in the TIFF fraction confirms the conclusion that SLPE (or similar PE species) could be an important constituent of the inner leaflet raft. Conclusion Such interactions suggest a possible existence of inner-leaflet nanoscale assemblies composed of cholesterol complexes with SLPE or similar unsaturated PE species."
https://openalex.org/W2094618322,"We previously showed that in quiescent cells, p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein)family coactivators repress c-myc and prevent premature induction of DNA synthesis. p300/CBP-depleted cells exit G(1) early and continue to accumulate in S phase but do not progress into G(2)/M, and eventually they die of apoptosis. Here, we show that the S-phase arrest in these cells is because of an intra-S-phase block. The inappropriate DNA synthesis that occurs as a result of forced expression of c-myc leads to the activation of the DNA damage response as evidenced by the phosphorylation of several checkpoint related proteins and the formation of foci containing gamma-H2AX. The activation of checkpoint response is related to the induction of c-myc, as the phosphorylation of checkpoint proteins can be reversed when cells are treated with a c-Myc inhibitor or when Myc synthesis is blocked by short hairpin RNA. Using the DNA fiber assay, we show that in p300-depleted cells initiation of replication occurs from multiple replication origins. Chromatin loading of the Cdc45 protein also indicates increased origin activity in p300 knockdown cells. Immunofluorescence experiments indicate that c-Myc colocalizes with replication foci, consistent with the recently reported direct role of c-Myc in the initiation of DNA synthesis. Thus, the inappropriate S-phase entry of p300 down-regulated cells is likely to be because of c-Myc-induced deregulated replication origin activity, which results in replicative stress, activation of a DNA damage response, and S-phase arrest. Our results point to an important role for p300 in maintaining genomic integrity by negatively regulating c-myc."
https://openalex.org/W2086164249,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Cip1) plays an important role in the cellular response to DNA damage. In normal cells, genotoxic stress activates the ATM-p53 pathway that up-regulates the expression of p21(Cip1) leading to cell cycle arrest. However, we have found that in several neoplastic cell lines, ionizing radiation (IR) induces ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p21(Cip1). This process is independent of the ATM pathway as it occurs in immortalized A-T fibroblasts. Knockdown of Skp2, an F-box protein capable of regulating the normal turnover of p21(Cip1), does not prevent the IR-induced degradation. Instead, this process requires the Cul4-DDB1(Cdt2) E3 ligase as knockdown of either DDB1 or Cdt2 rescues p21(Cip1) degradation after IR. Mutating the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-binding site of p21(Cip1) also prevents its IR-induced degradation suggesting that the p21(Cip1)-proliferating cell nuclear antigen interaction is critical for this event. Although ectopic expression of a nondegradable p21(Cip1) did not by itself affect the clonogenic survival of HEK293 cells after IR, the degradation of p21(Cip1) and other targets of the Cul4-DDB1(Cdt2) E3 ligase may collectively contribute to the survival of neoplastic cells after ionizing radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2024251011,"Ku70 forms a heterodimer with Ku80, called Ku that is well known for repairing DNA double-strand breaks through non-homologous end joining. As a result, deletion of either causes a very similar phenotype in mice that includes hypersensitivity to clastogens and early aging. In addition, deletion of Ku80 along with the cell cycle checkpoint protein, p53, dramatically increases the incidence of pro-B-cell lymphoma. Even though Ku70- p53-mutant mice have not been analysed, a logical assumption is they would exhibit the same cancer phenotype. Here, we test this assumption by comparing p53-mutant littermates deleted for either Ku70 or Ku80 or both. We find this assumption to be incorrect as p53-mutants live significantly longer when deleted for Ku70 rather than Ku80 or Ku70+Ku80. We also find the former cohort displays much lower levels of pro-B-cell lymphoma than the latter two cohorts. As pro-B-cell lymphoma is caused by a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 15, we tested fibroblasts for DNA repair capacity, and found that p53-mutant fibroblasts are more sensitive to streptonigrin and paraquat when deleted for Ku80 as compared with Ku70. Thus, Ku80 may function outside the Ku heterodimer to influence DNA damage repair presenting the possibility that Ku80 influenced the open coding ends in a manner that suppressed a cancer-causing translocation."

AMPA receptors, permeable to sodium and potassium ions, open in response to glutamate generating rapid excitatory post-synaptic potentials. NMDA receptors allow for the influx of extracellular calcium into the post-synaptic cell in response to glutamate and a concomitant depolarization that relieves the magnesium block of channel conductance. Through the temporal and spatial summation of excitatory post-synaptic potentials and glutamate release, NMDA receptors can contribute significantly to post-synaptic membrane depolarization.

There is, therefore, an extensive range of mechanisms by which GPCRs can influence NMDA receptor function in neurons. In the current study we investigate further the relationship between NMDA receptors and GPCRs by focusing on the M3-muscarinic receptor endogenously expressed in cerebellar granule (CG) neurons. Previous studies have determined that muscarinic receptors regulate both NMDA receptor function and contribute to LTP and LTD (16Shinoe T. Matsui M. Taketo M.M. Manabe T. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11194-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Auerbach J.M. Segal M. J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Grishin A.A.

Here we demonstrate that the NMDA receptor-mediated activation of CamKII results in the phosphorylation of the M3-muscarinic receptor and subsequent uncoupling of the receptor from the Gq/11/phosphoinositide pathway. Our study demonstrates that there is a complex reciprocal relationship between GPCRs and NMDA receptors where each is able to regulate the activity of the other in a process that is likely to be essential in establishing the threshold activities that contribute to synaptic plasticity. Mouse CG neurons were cultured as described previously (28Leist M. Volbracht C. Kuhnle S. Fava E. Ferrando-May E. Nicotera P. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 750-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cerebella from 7–8-day-old Balb/c pups were mechanically and enzymatically (trypsin) dissociated. The cells were subsequently plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well plates (Nunclon) or on round glass coverslips (25-mm diameter) at a cell density of 0.25 × 106 cells/cm2, in basal medium Eagle (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm KCl, penicillin/streptomycin, 10% fetal calf serum. Cytosine arabionoside (10 μm) was added 48 h after plating to prevent glial cell proliferation. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and used after 7–8 days. The experiments were performed in CSS-25 buffer (120 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 15 mm glucose, 25 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) or in a modified CSS-25 buffer as indicated). For transfection of siRNA duplexes CG neurons cultured for 5 days were transfected with either siRNA duplexes specific for CamKII-β (purchased as verified siRNA from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or scrambled siRNA control. CG neurons were transfected with 80 pmol of scrambled siRNA or 80 pmol of specific siRNA using 5 μl of FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) per transfection. The cells were used for phosphorylation experiments 48 h post-transfection. In vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling, receptor solubilization, and immunoprecipitation were conducted as described previously (29Torrecilla I. Spragg E.J. Poulin B. McWilliams P.J. Mistry S.C. Blaukat A. Tobin A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In brief, CG neurons in 6-well plates were washed and incubated for 2 h in CSS-25 buffer (1 ml) containing 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (GE Healthcare). The cells were then stimulated with methacholine, glutamate, NMDA, AMPA, or kainic acid at a final concentration of 100 μm for 5 min unless otherwise stated. Where appropriate, antagonists or other compounds were added before the addition of agonists. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4), and the M3-muscarinic receptor was immunoprecipitated using an in house anti-mouse M3 receptor polyclonal antibody (29Torrecilla I.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography or using a STORM phosphor-imager (GE Healthcare). To control for equal receptor loading, immunoprecipitated proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were then exposed before being used in Western blots with M3-muscarinic receptor specific monoclonal antibodies (see Figs. 1A and 3A). Quantification of the phosphorylation status of the receptor was determined by analysis using the ImageQuant and AlphaEase softwares.FIGURE 3siRNA knock-down of CamKII reduces NMDA-mediated M3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation. CG neurons on day 5 of culture were sham-transfected (NT) or transfected with scrambled siRNA duplexes or siRNA directed against CamKII-β (80 pmol). A, after a further 2 days the cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with NMDA (100 μm for 5 min). The cells were then solubilized, and M3-muscarinic receptor was immunoprecipitated. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and exposed to reveal the phosphorylated receptor, after which the membrane was processed by Western blot to determine equal receptor loading. B, a small sample of the lysate from each condition was retained for Western blotting for CamKII-β, GRK-2, and GRK-6. Shown are the data from a typical experiment carried out at least three times. The graphs represent the cumulative data (mean ± S.E.) of at least three experiments carried out in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Experiments examining changes in free intracellular Ca2+ were conducted on CG neurons cultured on coverslips. The cells were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 AM (2 μm, 30 min) (Molecular Probes) in CSS-25 at 37 °C and mounted on to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted epifluorescence microscope fitted with a perfusion chamber (flow rate at 3 ml/min). The cells were excited at 340 and 380 nm at a sample rate of 0.67 Hz by means of an excitation filter wheel. Sequential fluorescent image pairs were collected at wavelengths >510 nm via a cooled CCD camera (ORCA-ER, Hamamatsu) and converted to pseudo color images after background subtraction. Free intracellular Ca2+ signal was expressed as 340/380 ratio of fluorescence. Approximately 10–15 cells were analyzed in each experiment, and the mean values from different cultures were averaged. For experiments involving analysis of phosphoinositide signaling, the translocation of eGFP-PHPLCδ1 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol was conducted as described previously (30Nash M.S.

Plasmid DNA carrying the eGFP-PHPLCδ1 construct was transfected into CG neurons via the calcium-phosphate precipitation method. Briefly, 1 day after preparation of CG neurons, 3 μg of DNA/well in a volume of 10 μl of H2O was added to 85 μl of HEPES-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 50 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 21 mm HEPES, pH 7.1) and to 5 μl 2.5 m CaCl2. After 20 min, the solution was added to the cells. The following day, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were cultured for a further 6–7 days. The coverslips were then mounted on to the microscope, and images of eGFP were captured at a rate of 1 Hz. Phosphoinositide responses were measured as the relative change in fluorescence intensity in the cytosol. The data are expressed as a self-ratio (F/F0) resulting from subtraction of background fluorescence followed by dividing the fluorescence intensity at a given time by the initial fluorescence within each region of interest. Where NMDA was used to stimulate CG neurons, the cells were perfused with Mg2+-free buffer before the addition of NMDA. CG neurons expressing eGFP-PHPLCδ1 were perfused with CSS-25 containing a maximal concentration of methacholine (100 μm) for 2 min. This generated a phosphoinositide response that was termed S1 and served as an internal control. Methacholine was then removed, and a lag time of 12 min was allowed for the cells to recover. NMDA (100 μm) was then applied for 5 min, followed by a wash-out period of 2 min. The cells were then stimulated with a second application of methacholine, and the resulting phosphoinositide response was termed S2. Desensitization of the M3-muscarinic receptor response was determined as the difference in the amplitude between the S1 and S2 responses. CG neurons cultured in 6-well plates were incubated with CSS-25 containing NMDA (100 μm) and/or methacholine (100 μm) for the indicated times. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold CSS-25 and incubated with CSS-25 containing a saturating concentration of the muscarinic receptor antagonist [3H]N-methylscopolamine (0.5 nm) for 4 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold CSS-25 and solubilized by the addition of lysis buffer (200 μm). Receptor expression was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by the inclusion of 10 μm atropine. GST fusion constructs containing the full mouse third intracellular loop R252 to T491 (GST-3iloop) or GST alone were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) IRL bacteria and purified as described previously (32Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 5 μg of protein was incubated with 200 ng of CaM kinase II (New England Biolabs) in assay buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03 mg/ml calmodulin (Calbiochem)) containing 50 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels, dried, and exposed to autoradiography film. For mass spectrometric experiments, the reactions were carried out in assay buffer containing 1 mm ATP. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the protein bands were revealed by staining with Ponceau S (Sigma). The protein bands were excised from the membrane and blocked with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 0.6% acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C before digestion with trypsin (1 μg) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, overnight at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides were collected, dried in a rotary evaporator, and resuspended in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Enrichment of phosphopeptides was carried out using titanium dioxide contained in a MonoTip (GL Sciences Inc) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the phosphopeptides were eluted in a solution of 5% ammonium hydroxide containing 20% acetonitrile. Where indicated, the enriched phosphopeptides were dried and resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2 and subjected to further proteolytic digestion by the addition of 1 μg of chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 25 °C. Samples resulting from trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion were acidified with formic acid and mixed 1:1 with a solution containing 10 mg/ml of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Sigma) in 50% acetonitrile, 1% phosphoric acid. An aliquot of the resulting sample (0.5 μl) was spotted onto a stainless steel target plate. Analysis of peptide digests was carried out using a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) in positive ion reflectron mode over the m/z range 800–7000. LC-MS/MS was carried out upon each sample using a 4000 Q-Trap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Peptides resulting from proteolytic digestion were loaded at high flow rate onto a reverse phase trapping column (0.3 mm inner diameter × 1 mm), containing 5 μm C18 300 Å Acclaim PepMap media (Dionex) and eluted through a reverse phase capillary column (75 μm inner diameter × 150 mm) containing Jupiter Proteo 4 μm 90 Å media (Phenomenex, UK) that was self-packed using a high pressure packing device (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark). The output from the column was sprayed directly into the nanospray ion source of the 4000 Q-Trap mass spectrometer. The analysis was carried out in positive ion mode using data-dependent switching. Fragment ion spectra generated by LC-MS/MS were searched using the MASCOT search tool (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) against an updated copy of the SwissProt protein data base using appropriate parameters. The criteria for protein identification were based on the manufacturer's definitions (Matrix Science Ltd.) (33Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6661) Google Scholar) Candidate peptides with probability-based Mowse scores exceeding threshold (p < 0.05), thus indicating a significant or extensive homology, were referred to as “hits.” Protein scores were derived from peptide ion scores as a non-probability basis for ranking proteins. For the phosphopeptides elucidated by MASCOT, individual MS/MS spectra were interrogated manually to validate both the peptide identity and position of assignment. In each case it was clear as to the identity of the peptide (and that the peptide was indeed phosphorylated), but for some MS/MS spectra it was not possible to validate the MASCOT assignment of the residue position for phosphorylation, because of low abundance of the required fragment ions. In these cases (because the sample amount was not limiting), the samples were repeated using multiple reaction monitoring inclusion lists comprising ion pairs consisting of the precursor ion [M+2H]2+ and that of the neutral ion loss [M+2H-H3PO4]2+, such that the MS/MS data were obtained over a longer time period (5.86 s), which resulted in significantly improved data quality. This allowed unambiguous assignment of the position of phosphorylation. The statistic used was S.D. of at least three determinations, and significance was determined using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. Significance was accepted when p < 0.05. The phosphorylation status of the M3-muscarinic receptor can be monitored by prelabeling cells with [32P]orthophosphate followed by solubilization of the receptor and immunoprecipitation with receptor specific antibodies (34Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 35Budd D.C. Willars G.B. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4581-4587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Experiments of this type have previously demonstrated that the M3-muscarinic receptor endogenously expressed in mouse CG neurons is phosphorylated upon stimulation with the muscarinic receptor agonist methacholine (29Torrecilla I. Spragg E.J. Poulin B. McWilliams P.J. Mistry S.C. Blaukat A. Tobin A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the current study we demonstrate that stimulation of glutamate receptors using NMDA resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation state of the M3 muscarinic receptor (Fig. 1A). In these experiments the phosphorylated M3-muscarinic receptor appears as a band running at just less than 100 kDa. Western blots of the nitrocellulose membrane containing the radiolabeled phosphorylated receptor demonstrated that equal amounts of receptor are immunoprecipitated under various stimulation conditions (Fig. 1A). Importantly, no M3-muscarinic receptor was detected in immunoprecipitates from CG neurons prepared from M3-muscarinic receptor knock-out mice (Fig. 1A). Glutamate increased muscarinic receptor phosphorylation by 2.21 ± 0.25-fold (n = 5) over basal and NMDA by 2.55 ± 0.33-fold [n = 5] (Fig. 1B). This response appears to be mediated via NMDA receptors because neither AMPA nor kainate had any significant effect on M3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Whereas addition of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine was able to completely block the phosphorylation mediated by direct activation of the M3-muscarinic receptor using the muscarinic agonist methacholine (Fig. 1B), atropine had no effect on the NMDA- or glutamate-mediated phosphorylation (data not shown). Furthermore, combined stimulation with NMDA and methacholine did not enhance the M3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation over that induced by the agonists individually (data not shown). A role of NMDA receptors was confirmed by use of the NMDA receptor-specific antagonists MK-801 and AP-5, which were able to block NMDA-mediated phosphorylation of the M3-muscarinic receptor (Fig. 1D). The NMDA showed a transient time course that reached a maximum at 5 min followed by a steady decrease to basal levels by 30 min (Fig. 1E). NMDA receptor activation will result in an influx of extracellular calcium and the subsequent activation of a number of calcium-dependent signaling molecules in particular CamKII (3Sheng M. Kim M.J. Science. 2002; 298: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 4Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). We show here that the ability of NMDA receptors to stimulate the phosphorylation of M3-muscarinic receptors is dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium in the medium (Fig. 2). Following [32P]orthophosphate labeling, the cells were washed with medium (CSS-25) containing calcium or with nominally calcium-free medium. A subsequent stimulation with NMDA resulted in a robust phosphorylation of the M3-muscarinic receptor only in cells that were incubated in calcium containing medium (Fig. 2A). In contrast, phosphorylation of M3-muscarinic receptors in response to the muscarinic receptor agonist methacholine was not affected by the absence of calcium in the medium (Fig. 2A). To investigate the role of CamKII in the NMDA-mediated response CG neurons were pretreated with the selective CamKII inhibitors KN-93 or KN-62. Both of these pharmacological inhibitors prevented NMDA- mediated muscarinic receptor phosphorylation, whereas the inactive analogue KN-92 had no effect (Fig. 2B). To control for the possibility that the CamKII inhibitors were working in an indirect manner by affecting free intracellular calcium concentrations, we measured the rise in intracellular calcium following NMDA treatment in the absence or presence of KN-62. As illustrated in Fig. 2 (C and D), the CamKII inhibitor did not alter the ability of NMDA to increase intracellular free calcium. These pharmacological studies indicated that CamKII was involved in phosphorylation of M3-muscarinic receptors in response to NMDA-stimulation. To further test this, we used siRNA duplexes against the β-isoform of CamKII, which we found to be highly expressed in mouse CG neurons (supplemental Fig. S1). These siRNA duplexes significantly decreased CamKII-β by more than 70% but had no off target effects on kinases that have previous been shown to phosphorylate the GPCRs, i.e. GRK2, GRK6 (Fig. 3). Under conditions where CamKII-β was knocked down, NMDA-mediated phosphorylation of the M3-muscarinic receptor was decreased by 45.6 + 8.1% (n = 3 + S.D.). These results indicated that CamKII-β, acting downstream of the NMDA receptor, either directly phosphorylates the M3-muscarinic receptor or is on a kinase cascade that results in the phosphorylation of the receptor. The mouse M3-muscarinic receptor contains a large third intracellular loop with 33 serine"
https://openalex.org/W2011865363,"Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases coordinate cell death through restricted proteolysis of diverse protein substrates and play a conserved role in apoptosis from nematodes to man. However, while numerous substrates for the mammalian cell death-associated caspases have now been described, few caspase substrates have been identified in other organisms. Here, we have utilized a proteomics-based approach to identify proteins that are cleaved by caspases during apoptosis in Drosophila D-Mel2 cells, a subline of the Schneider S2 cell line. This approach identified multiple novel substrates for the fly caspases and revealed that bicaudal/βNAC is a conserved substrate for Drosophila and mammalian caspases. RNAi-mediated silencing of bicaudal expression in Drosophila D-Mel2 cells resulted in a block to proliferation, followed by spontaneous apoptosis. Similarly, silencing of expression of the mammalian bicaudal homologue, βNAC, in HeLa, HEK293T, MCF-7 and MRC5 cells also resulted in spontaneous apoptosis. These data suggest that bicaudal/βNAC is essential for cell survival and is a conserved target of caspases from flies to man."

Pto specifically recognizes both effectors by direct physical interactions triggering activation of immune responses. Here, we used a chemical-genetic approach to sensitize Pto to analogs of PP1, an ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor. By using PP1 analogs in combination with the sensitized Pto (Ptoas), we examined the role of Pto kinase activity in effector recognition and signal transduction. Strikingly, while PP1 analogs efficiently inhibited kinase activity of Ptoas in vitro, they enhanced interactions of Ptoas with AvrPto and AvrPtoB in a yeast two-hybrid system. In addition, in the presence of PP1 analogs, Ptoas bypassed mutations either at an autophosphorylation site critical for the Pto-AvrPto interaction or at catalytically essential residues and interacted with both effectors. Moreover, in the presence of the PP1 analog 3MB-PP1, a kinase-deficient form of Ptoas triggered an AvrPto-dependent hypersensitive response in planta. These findings suggest that, rather than phosphorylation per se, a conformational change likely triggered by autophosphorylation in Pto and mimicked by ligand binding in Ptoas is a prerequisite for recognition of bacterial effectors.

Protein kinases regulate a wide variety of cellular processes and signal transduction pathways in plants. The large number of protein kinases present in plant proteomes (>1,000 in Arabidopsis, >1,500 in rice) makes it a very difficult challenge to assign precise roles to each individual kinase (1Dardick C. Chen J. Richter T. Ouyang S. Ronald P. Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Arabidopsis Genome InitiativeNature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7211) Google Scholar). To study protein kinase functions, strategies based on single knock-out mutations and gene silencing are widely employed. However, such efforts are often compromised by lethality, in the case of essential genes, or by functional redundancy and cellular homeostasis. Cell-permeable inhibitors that are highly specific for individual protein kinases would allow overcoming the limitations of genetic approaches to enzyme inactivation and thus represent invaluable tools for assisting in the definition of plant kinase functions. However, while small molecule inhibitors have been recently developed in great numbers for animal protein kinases, their use in the study of plant kinases is still very limited. Specific kinase inhibitors would be particularly useful for elucidating modes of activation and signaling of protein kinases that serve as receptors in plant innate immunity. Two major classes of receptors detect pathogen invasion and activate immunity in plants (3Chisholm S.T. Coaker G. Day B. Staskawicz B.J.

Pto specifically recognizes the presence of AvrPto and AvrPtoB in the plant cell by direct physical interactions that result in the activation of the hypersensitive response (HR), an array of defense responses including cell death at the site of pathogen infection (11Pedley K.F.

Bot. 2008; 59: 501-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Pto-mediated immunity requires the nucleotide binding site/leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRR) protein Prf that associates with Pto in a high molecular weight complex (19Mucyn T.S. Clemente A.

Functional screens based on virus-induced gene silencing identified MAP kinase cascades and additional signaling proteins acting downstream of the Pto/Prf complex (20del Pozo O. Pedley K.F.

Plant J. 2003; 36: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Extensive biochemical studies revealed the ability of Pto to autophosphorylate at multiple sites and to phosphorylate substrate proteins in vitro (22Sessa G. D'Ascenzo M. Loh Y.T. Martin G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15860-15865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Sessa G. D'Ascenzo M. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the role of Pto kinase activity in recognition of bacterial effectors and signal transduction has been controversial for a long time and not yet entirely resolved. Early studies examined the requirement of Pto kinase activity for effector recognition by analyzing the effect of point mutations at conserved catalytic residues or autophosphorylation sites on the Pto-AvrPto or Pto-AvrPtoB physical interaction in a yeast two-hybrid system (23Sessa G. D'Ascenzo M. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Kim Y.J. Lin N.C. Martin G.B.

In most instances kinase-deficient forms of Pto did not interact with AvrPto or AvrPtoB, suggesting a requirement of Pto kinase activity for effector recognition; however, a few exceptions supported opposite conclusions (25Rathjen J.P. Chang J.H. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Wu A.J. Andriotis V.M. Durrant M.C. Rathjen J.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). More recently, structural and in vitro biochemical analysis suggested that stabilization of the Pto P+1 loop by phosphorylation at Thr-199 is a prerequisite for AvrPto recognition (27Xing W. Zou Y. Liu Q. Liu J. Luo X. Huang Q. Chen S. Zhu L. Bi R. Hao Q. Wu J.W. Zhou J.M. Chai J. Nature. 2007; 449: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As for the role of Pto kinase activity in signal transduction, evidence that kinase activity is dispensable after effector recognition derived from constitutive gain-of-function Pto mutants that elicit HR in an effector-independent manner, while not displaying kinase activity in vitro (25Rathjen J.P. Chang J.H. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Wu A.J. Andriotis V.M. Durrant M.C. Rathjen J.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, Pto kinase activity appears to be required for signaling based on a mutation at the Pto autophosphorylation site Ser-198, which is required for the elicitation of the HR but dispensable for the interaction with AvrPto (23Sessa G. D'Ascenzo M. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To elucidate further the role of Pto kinase activity in recognition of AvrPto and AvrPtoB, and in effector-dependent activation of immune responses, we used a chemical-genetic approach that renders a given kinase uniquely susceptible to analogs of 1-tert-butyl-3-p-tolyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ylamine (PP1), an ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor (28Bishop A.C. Buzko O. Shokat K.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 167-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J.

In this approach, substitution of a conserved and bulky residue, termed the gatekeeper residue, with alanine or glycine generates a unique pocket in the ATP binding site of the kinase of interest, which is not present in any wild-type kinase. The sensitized mutant can then be selectively and potently inhibited by ATP-competitive small molecules that contain substituents occupying the novel pocket. This strategy has been successfully applied to specifically inhibit catalytic activity of protein kinases from multiple organisms including plants, yeast, and mammalian cell cultures by using PP1 analogs (29Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. Wood J.L. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M.

Science. 2003; 302: 1533-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We previously engineered the Pto ATP-binding site to contain a unique enlarged binding pocket while retaining catalytic activity (34Zhang C. Kenski D.M. Paulson J.L. Bonshtien A. Sessa G. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Shokat K.M. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the analog-sensitive Pto allele (Ptoas) the gate-keeper residue was mutated to alanine (Y114A) and a second site mutation (L68I) was introduced to rescue the severely reduced kinase activity of Pto(Y114A) (34Zhang C. Kenski D.M. Paulson J.L. Bonshtien A. Sessa G. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Shokat K.M. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the present study, we confirmed that Ptoas displays functional properties of wild-type Pto and is specifically targeted by PP1-derived small-molecule inhibitors. Binding of PP1 analogs to the enlarged ATP-binding site of Ptoas resulted in specific inhibition of kinase activity in vitro, yet surprisingly allowed kinase-deficient forms of Ptoas to bind bacterial effectors in yeast and to elicit an effector-dependent HR in planta. These results, interpreted in combination with structural data (27Xing W. Zou Y. Liu Q. Liu J. Luo X. Huang Q. Chen S. Zhu L. Bi R. Hao Q. Wu J.W. Zhou J.M. Chai J. Nature. 2007; 449: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggest that a conformational change, possibly elicited by autophosphorylation in wild-type Pto and mimicked by binding of PP1 analogs in Ptoas, enables Pto to recognize bacterial effectors. In addition, our findings support the notion that kinase activity is dispensable for Pto-mediated signal transduction. Finally, the chemical-genetic strategy used here for Pto may be applied to the in vivo study of other plant protein kinases. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of Pto was performed in the shuttle vector pTEX containing the Pto coding region under the control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (35Frederick R.D. Thilmony R.L. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 241-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), or in the plasmids pGEX-4T1 and pEG202, containing the Pto coding region fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and to the LexA DNA binding domain, respectively (22Sessa G.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutations were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Sequences of oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are listed in supplemental Table S1. The insertion in the gene of the desired mutations was confirmed by sequencing. Protein Expression in Escherichia coli—Constructs for the expression in E. coli of MPK2 as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion and of Pto, Ptoas, Pti1, and the kinase-deficient mutant Pti1(K96N) as GST fusions were described previously (22Sessa G.

Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). GST fusions were expressed in the E. coli strain DH12S grown to A600 = 1. Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by 0.05 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 24 °C. GST fusion proteins were then affinity-purified by using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Expression in E. coli and purification of MBP fusions with amylose resin were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Kinase Activity Assays—Kinase assays to test autophosphorylation of Pto forms, Pti1, and MPK2 were performed in vitro with 2 μg of the recombinant kinase in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2, and 20 mm ATP) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). When testing phosphorylation of Pti1(K69N) by Pto forms, 2 μg of GST-Pti1(K69N) was included in the reaction mixture. PP1 analogs were synthesized as described (38Benjamin K.R. Zhang C. Shokat K.M.

Soc. 1999; 121: 627-631Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and their effect on kinase activity was tested at the final concentration of 1 μm. As a control, assays were performed in the absence of inhibitors with an equivalent volume of DMSO. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. At this time, phosphate incorporation was found to be linear for the amount of enzyme used in the reaction. Proteins were then fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the dried gel was analyzed by Phosphorimager (Fujifilm FLA-2000) or exposed to autoradiography. IC50 values for the PP1 analogs 3MB-PP1, 1NM-PP1, 2Na-PP1, and Ac-PP1 were determined by measuring the counts per minute of 32P transferred by GST-Ptoas to GST-Pti1(K96N). Various inhibitor concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 1 μm were added to kinase reactions performed as described above. IC50 values were calculated as the concentration of inhibitor at which 32P incorporation into GST-Pti1(K96N) was 50% of that in control reactions carried out in the absence of inhibitor. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Yeast two-hybrid interactions were tested in the yeast strain EGY48 using standard protocols (40Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

Yeast were transformed sequentially with the lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18 -34, the bait plasmid pEG202 expressing LexA DNA-binding domain fused to wild-type or mutant Pto, and the prey plasmid pJG4 -5 expressing the GAL4 activation domain fused either to AvrPto, AvrPtoB1-387 or their mutant forms. The Pto bait vector as well as the AvrPto and AvrPtoB1-387 prey vectors were described previously (37Zhou J. Loh Y.T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B.

Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology 2. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1989: 13.6.1-13Google Scholar), except that yeast cells were grown in minimal medium supplemented with 2% galactose, 1% raffi-nose, and lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan. To test their effect on protein-protein interactions, PP1 analogs or an equal volume of DMSO as control, were added to the liquid growth media at the indicated concentrations. Expression in yeast of LexA fusion proteins was determined by Western blot analysis using LexA antibodies (Upstate) and chemiluminescent visualization, as previously described (35Frederick R.D. Thilmony R.L. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 241-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Agrobacterium-mediated Transient Expression—Expression cassettes containing Pto forms driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and followed by the Nos terminator were excised by the EcoRI restriction enzyme from the pTEX shuttle vector and inserted at the corresponding site of the binary vector pBTEX (35Frederick R.D. Thilmony R.L. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 241-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). pBTEX plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium GV2260 by electroporation. Before inoculation, Agrobacterium strains were grown overnight at 28 °C in Luria broth medium with the appropriate antibiotics and washed in infiltration medium (10 mm morpholinoethanesulfonic acid, 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.2 mm acetosyringone). For co-expression of Pto forms with AvrPto or AvrPtoB, Agrobacterium strains expressing Pto forms were mixed with strains carrying the plasmids pBTEX: avrPto (35Frederick R.D. Thilmony R.L. Sessa G. Martin G.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 241-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or pBTEX:avrPtoB (24Kim Y.J. Lin N.C. Martin G.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) at a final A600 = 0.06 each, and infiltrated into leaves of 6-8-week-old N. benthamiana or tomato (S. lycopersicum) plants. The tomato cultivars used in this study are Rio Grande PtoS (RG-PtoS; pto/pto; Prf/Prf) lacking a functional Pto gene (11Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2003; 41: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and Rio Grande prf3 (RG-prf3; Pto/Pto; prf/prf) carrying a mutation in the Prf gene (45Salmeron J.M. Oldroyd G.E. Rommens C.M. Scofield S.R. Kim H.S. Lavelle D.T. Dahlbeck D. Staskawicz B.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). To test the effect of the PP1 analogs in planta, N. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with Agrobacterium carrying the indicated gene constructs in the pBTEX binary vector and were treated 20 h after infiltration with a solution containing 100 μm 3MB-PP1, or DMSO as control, and 0.025% Silwet-77. The solution was applied using a fine brush. The HR developed within 48-72 h after infiltration, and the severity of the symptoms was recorded with scores from 1 to 5 (where 1 = no symptoms and 5 = cell death in the whole infiltrated area). An HR index reflecting the degree of symptoms developed by each Pto mutant in the different treatments, as compared with wild-type Pto, was calculated according to Equation 1 (23Sessa G. D'Ascenzo M. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this formula, the entries within the brackets are the scores for symptoms caused by the expression of the indicated proteins, and PtoM represents the specific mutant tested. Ptoas Kinase Activity Is Specifically and Potently Inhibited by ATP-competitive Small Molecules—We have previously reported the engineering of an analog-sensitive form of Pto (Ptoas), which retains catalytic activity despite containing an enlarged ATP-binding site (34Zhang C. Kenski D.M. Paulson J.L. Bonshtien A. Sessa G. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Shokat K.M. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because of the enlarged ATP-binding pocket, Ptoas is predicted to be sensitized to specific inhibition by ATP-competitive small molecules, such as analogs of the kinase inhibitor PP1 (46Bishop A.C. Shah K. Liu Y. Witucki L. Kung C. Shokat K.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this study, we set out to use a combination of Ptoas and specific small molecule inhibitors to assess the role of Pto kinase activity in recognition of Pst effectors and signal transduction. To identify specific and potent small molecule inhibitors of Ptoas kinase activity, we screened a panel of various PP1 analogs (supplemental Fig. S1) for their ability to inhibit in vitro Ptoas and wild-type Pto autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the substrate Pti1(K96N). As shown in Fig. 1A, all the inhibitors examined, with the exception of 2NM-PP1 and aMB-PP1, specifically inhibited the ability of Ptoas to phosphorylate Pti1(K96N), while having negligible effect on wild-type Pto. Similar results were obtained for Ptoas and wild-type Pto autophosphorylation (data not shown). IC50 values were then determined for analogs that at a concentration of 1 μm showed over 75% inhibition of Ptoas kinase activity (3MB-PP1, 1NM-PP1, 2Na-PP1, and Ac-PP1). 1NM-PP1 and 3MB-PP1 were the most potent inhibitors with IC50 values of 120 and 160 nm, respectively (Table 1).TABLE 150% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of selected PP1 analogs for Ptoas kinase activityInhibitorIC50aIC50 is defined as the concentration of the inhibitor at which Ptoas kinase activity was 50% of the control (no inhibitor).nm1NM-PP11203MB-PP11602Na-PP1250Ac-PP1350a IC50 is defined as the concentration of the inhibitor at which Ptoas kinase activity was 50% of the control (no inhibitor). Open table in a new tab To further confirm the specificity of 1NM-PP1 and 3MB-PP1 to Ptoas, we tested in vitro the ability of these PP1 analogs to inhibit activity of the tomato serine/threonine kinase Pti1 and of the MAP kinase MPK2, which were previously proposed to participate in signaling pathways downstream of Pto (20del Pozo O. Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 37Zhou J. Loh Y.T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The effect of the two inhibitors was tested at concentrations corresponding to their IC50 values for Ptoas and at 1 μm. As shown in Fig. 1B, 1NM-PP1 and 3MB-PP1 were not able to significantly inhibit Pti1 and MPK2. Because of their potency and specificity to Ptoas, these ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitors were selected for subsequent functional analysis of Pto. Ptoas Displays Functional Properties of Wild-type Pto—Functional properties of Pto include its ability to elicit the HR when co-expressed with the Pst effectors AvrPto or AvrPtoB in N. benthamiana and tomato plants, respectively (24Kim Y.J.

Science. 1996; 274: 2060-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In addition, Pto physically interacts with AvrPto and AvrPtoB in a yeast two-hybrid system (24Kim Y.J. Lin N.C. Martin G.B.

https://openalex.org/W2067340263,"Human checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is an essential kinase required to preserve genome stability, and is activated by DNA replication blockage through the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated-and-Rad3-related (ATR)/ATRIP-signaling pathway. In this report, we show that a novel CHK1-interacting protein, FEM1B (human homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans sex determination fem1 protein), identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen, is involved in the activation of CHK1 by replication stress. Depletion of FEM1B by small interfering RNA in cancer cells impairs the activation of CHK1 kinase activity and attenuates the induction of CHK1 Ser345 phosphorylation upon replication interference. It is to be noted that, CHK2 Thr68 phosphorylation is not altered by FEM1B downregulation. By fractionation, we further demonstrated that FEM1B is able to associate with chromatin, and such association facilitates chromatin loading of the Rad9 protein. Consistently, ATR activity is poorly maintained in FEM1B knockdown cells; and FEM1B-ablated cells are as sensitive to replication block as CHK1-depleted cells. Our study has uncovered an adaptor protein FEM1B, which acts as a bridge linking CHK1 and Rad9, thus facilitating checkpoint signaling induced by replication stress."
