The products of oxidation may be satisfactorily accounted for by the formation of an intermediate hydroperoxide and its subsequent decomposition. As with the hydroperoxides of hydrocarbons, those of ethers are apparently often too unstable for isolation ; but in the case of tetrahydrofuran the hydroperoxide has been isolated in the pure state."

https://openalex.org/W1976057514,"SANGER1 has described the use of 1 : 2 : 4-fluoro-dinitrobenzene to identify the free amino-groups of several proteins, employing the separation of the N-dinitrophenyl amino-acids on columns of silica gel. We have had only limited success applying this method, owing to variations in different batches of the silica gel, and the difficulty of preparing evenly packed columns, which led to diffuse bands, difficult to separate. Sanger stated that with these derivatives on paper chromatograms2 long diffuse ‘tails' formed, making the method quite inferior to the silica method. We are able to report some success with the two-dimensional method, however, without apparently using any special technique which might account for the improvement. Consden et al.3 have also recently described the identification of α-δ-di- dinitrophenyl -ornithine running alone on a paper chromatogram, and Keston et al.4 using the p-I131-benzene-sulphonyl derivatives of amino-acids have been able to estimate them after their partial separation on a one-dimensional paper strip."
https://openalex.org/W2137143508,"In previous work on the denaturation of antibody, studies have been made of some of the factors influencing the inactivation of diphtheria antitoxin in urea solutions (1, 2). A quantitative formulation of a simple kinetic theory was found to fit satisfactorily the experimental data and to offer a reasonable explanation of the deviation of the inactivation from simple first order behavior (2). In the present work we have studied the inactivation of Staphylococcus antitoxin, investigating the influence of certain new factors on the rate and course of the over-all reaction, with a view toward gaining further insight into the mechanism of the reactions, and reinvestigating the influence of pH, a factor studied previously with diphtheria antitoxin, in order to test the applicability of the proposed kinetic mechanism to different antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W135362865,"Bergmann and Stein (1) have described a procedure for the isolation and purification of naturally occurring L-leucine based upon the precipitation and recrystallization of the slightly soluble salt of this amino acid with naphthalene-β-sulfonic acid. The product obtained was stated to be 97 per cent pure and to be free from methionine, a common contaminant of less pure preparations of L-leucine (2). We have found that L-leucine so prepared contains significant amounts of those amino acids which are oxidized by bromine in acid solution, and that a naphthalene sulfonate of superior purity can be obtained if the crude leucine is first treated with bromine water. The use of the preliminary bromine oxidation and of more dilute solutions than were used by Bergmann and Stein for the recrystallization of the naphthalene-β-sulfonate gave L-leucine preparations of exceptional purity when judged by qualitative tests and solubility determinations. Characteristic physical constants of L-leucine so prepared are given elsewhere in this paper. 

In the determination of the optical rotation of α-amino acids in aqueous acid solutions, it has been assumed at times that the concentration of the aqueous acid is not critical provided sufficient acid has been added to assure formation of the amino acid cation. Dunn et al. (3) have pointed out that the specific rotation of solutions of L- and D-alanine in hydrochloric acid is dependent upon the hydrochloric acid concentration, and the data presented in Fig. 1 clearly show a similar dependency in the case of either hydrochloric or sulfuric acid solutions of L-leucine."
