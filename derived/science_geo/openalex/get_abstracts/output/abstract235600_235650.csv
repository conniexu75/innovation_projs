https://openalex.org/W2071655334,"Two studies were performed to investigate the effects of an acute bout of physical exercise on the nuclear protein kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway in rat skeletal muscle. In Study 1, a group of rats (n=6) was run on the treadmill at 25 m/min, 5% grade, for 1 h or until exhaustion (Ex), and compared with a second group (n=6) injected with two doses of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 100 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 and 1 h prior to the acute exercise bout. Three additional groups of rats (n=6) were injected with either 8 mg/kg (i.p.) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 1 mmol/kg (i.p.) t-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP), or saline (C) and killed at resting condition. Ex rats showed higher levels of NF-kappaB binding and P50 protein content in muscle nuclear extracts compared with C rats. Cytosolic IkappaBalpha and IkappaB kinase (IKK) contents were decreased, whereas phospho-IkappaBalpha and phospho-IKK contents were increased, comparing Ex vs. C. The exercise-induced activation of NF-kappaB signaling cascade was partially abolished by PDTC treatment. LPS, but not tBHP, treatment mimicked and exaggerated the effects observed in Ex rats. In Study 2, the time course of exercise-induced NF-kappaB activation was examined. Highest levels of NF-kappaB binding were observed at 2 h postexercise. Decreased cytosolic IkappaBalpha and increased phosphor-IkappaBalpha content were found 0-1 h postexercise whereas P65 reached peak levels at 2-4 h. These data suggest that the NF-kappaB signaling pathway can be activated in a redox-sensitive manner during muscular contraction, presumably due to increased oxidant production. The cascade of intracellular events may be the overture to elevated gene expression of manganese superoxide dismutase reported earlier (Pfluegers Arch. 442, 426-434, 2001)."
https://openalex.org/W1973251504,"The activity of NF-κB is controlled at several levels including the phosphorylation of the strongly transactivating p65 (RelA) subunit. However, the overall number of phosphorylation sites, the signaling pathways and protein kinases that target p65 NF-κB and the functional role of these phosphorylations are still being uncovered. Using a combination of peptide arrays with in vitro kinase assays we identify serine 468 as a novel phosphorylation site of p65 NF-κB. Serine 468 lies within a GSK-3β consensus site, and recombinant GSK-3β specifically phosphorylates a GST-p65-(354–551) fusion protein at Ser468in vitro. In intact cells, phosphorylation of endogenous Ser468 of p65 is induced by the PP1/PP2A phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A and this effect is inhibited by the GSK-3β inhibitor LiCl. Reconstitution of p65-deficient cells with a p65 protein where serine 468 was mutated to alanine revealed a negative regulatory role of serine 468 for NF-κB activation. Collectively our results suggest that a GSK-3β-PP1-dependent mechanism regulates phosphorylation of p65 NF-κB at Ser468 in unstimulated cells and thereby controls the basal activity of NF-κB.

NF-κB is a dimeric transcription factor that plays an important role in the immune response, cell survival, and cancer. NF-κB activity is controlled at two levels: (i) by proteasome-dependent generation of DNA-binding subunits and (ii) by regulation of its nuclear function. In the recent years, evidence has accumulated that post-translational modifications of the DNA-binding subunits add another level of regulation for the function of NF-κB (1Ghosh S. Karin M.

Nonetheless, the overall number of p65 phosphorylation sites is not yet known as is the number of all potential p65 protein kinases. As an example, we and others (14Buss H. Dörrie A. Schmitz M.L.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 6336-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have recently shown that at least six distinct kinases converge on phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536. The molecular mechanisms and the biological consequences of p65 phosphorylation are currently a focal point of intense research (2Schmitz M.L. Mattioli I. Buss H. Kracht M. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Chen L.F. Greene W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Most p65 phosphorylation sites are located in the COOH-terminal part of the Rel homology domain and in the COOH-terminal transactivation domains (2Schmitz M.L. Mattioli I. Buss H. Kracht M. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Chen L.F. Greene W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The involvement of GSK-3β in activation of NF-κB as suggested by gene deletion has been a surprising finding, as NF-κB activating stimuli such as IL-1, TNF, or phorbol ester will inactivate GSK-3β by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT-mediated phosphorylation of its NH2 terminus (18Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar, 19Cohen P. Goedert M. Nat. Rev.

Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is suggested that in NF-κB activation the role of GSK-3β is non-redundant as the closely related enzyme GSK-3α cannot compensate for the loss of GSK-3β (8Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 18Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). In contrast with the results derived from knock-out mice, in neuronal cells expression of an active form of GSK-3β suppresses NF-κB activity by inhibiting IκB kinase (IKK) 1The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PP1 and PP2A, protein phosphatase 1 and 2A, respectively. and stabilizing IκB (21Sanchez J.F.

Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). GSK-3β has also recently been shown to phosphorylate a GST-p65 fusion protein in vitro, but the relevant site(s) have not been determined and it has remained unclear if p65 is a physiological substrate for GSK-3β in vivo (23Schwabe R.F. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G204-G211Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Using a peptide array-based approach (24Himpel S. Tegge W. Frank R. Leder S. Joost H.G. Becker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2431-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) we detected a protein kinase activity that specifically phosphorylated Ser468 of p65 NF-κB. Experiments presented here strongly suggest that GSK-3β is a physiological Ser468 protein kinase and we imply this phosphorylation site in negative control of NF-κB. In the light of the opposing findings regarding the role of GSK-3β in NF-κB signaling our results close an important gap in the understanding of the role of GSK-3β in regulation of p65 activity. Cells and Materials—HeLa cells stably expressing the tet transactivator protein were a kind gift of H. Bujard, Heidelberg, Germany. p65 –/– cells were a kind gift of H. Nakano, Tokyo, Japan. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, complemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l -glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Antibodies against the following proteins or peptides were used in this study: IκBα (9242), phospho-(Ser32/36) IκBα (9241), phospho-Ser468 NF-κB (3039), phospho-(Ser21/9) GSK-3α/β (9331), all from Cell Signaling Technology and p65 NF-κB (C-20) from Santa Cruz and GSK-3β (610201) from BD Biosciences. Recombinant GSK-3β (P6040S) was from New England Biolabs. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were from Sigma. Human recombinant IL-1α was a kind gift of J. Saklatvala, London, UK. calyculin A (9902) was from Cell Signaling. Peptide Arrays—The peptide array containing p65 NF-κB peptide spots was generated following SPOT synthesis (25Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar). 180 peptide fragments of 15 amino acid residues in length and overlapping by 12 residues were generated such that the entire p65 NF-κB protein sequence was covered. These peptides were chemically synthesized as an array of spots on an amino-polyethylene glycol-modified cellulose membrane (AC-S01, AIMS Scientific Products GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) as described previously (26Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). All peptides are NH2-terminal acetylated and remain covalently attached to the membrane via their carboxyl termini. Plasmids and Transfections—The expression plasmid for the p65 TAD, pGEX-p65-(354–551) was a kind gift of H. Sakurai, Toyama, Japan. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on GSH-Sepharose using standard procedures. pMT7-p65 NF-κB has been published (27Nourbakhsh M. Kalble S. Dorrie A. Hauser H. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4501-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and NF-κB (3)luc contained three NF-κB-binding sites upstream of a luciferase cDNA. pSV-β-gal coding for SV40 promoter driven β-galactosidase was from Promega. p65 –/– cells cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected at 70–80% confluence using Rotifect (Roth) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Cell Extracts—For the preparation of whole cell extracts cells were lysed directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. DNA was sheared by brief sonification, and soluble proteins were recovered after centrifugation of lysates at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For in vitro kinase assays cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.05, 30 mm NaPPi,1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate and freshly added 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 400 nm okadaic acid. After 10 min on ice, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously (27Nourbakhsh M. Kalble S. Dorrie A. Hauser H. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4501-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of cell extracts was determined by the method of Bradford, and samples were stored at –80 °C. In Vitro Kinase Assays—For the kinase assay shown in Fig. 1A,10 μl of cell lysate (50 μg of protein) was added to 1 μg of recombinant protein substrates (GST-p65-(354–551) or mutants thereof) in 10 μlofH2O and 10 μl of kinase buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 60 μm ATP, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). After 15 min at 30 °C in vitro phosphorylated GST-p65 fusion proteins were purified on GSH-Sepharose prior to SDS-PAGE as described by Holtmann et al. (28Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Then, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For in vitro phosphorylation of immobilized peptides the peptide arrays were incubated with 2 ml of cell extract (4.7 mg of protein), 2 ml of cell lysis buffer, and 2 ml of kinase buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). After 30 min at 30 °C membranes were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, once in 8 m urea, 1% SDS, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 40 °C, twice in H2O, and three times in EtOH. Air-dried membranes were autoradiographed at 4 °C or at room temperature. For the experiments shown in Fig. 2A 100 units of recombinant GSK-3β was incubated with 1 μg of GST-p65 fusions proteins in 1× GSK-3β reaction buffer (New England Biolabs) supplemented with 20 μm ATP and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 30 μl for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and phosphorylation of proteins visualized as described above. For detection of phosphorylated proteins by immunoblotting as shown in Fig. 2B 500 units of GSK-3β, 50 ng of GST-p65 fusion proteins, and 135 μm ATP were used in the kinase reaction, and radioactive ATP was omitted. Western blotting and site-directed mutagenesis were performed as described by Buss et al. (14Buss H. Dörrie A. Schmitz M.L. Hoffmann E. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (October 15, 10.1074/jbc.M409825200)Google Scholar). To investigate the occurrence of IL-1-inducible phosphorylation sites within the transactivating COOH terminus of p65, whole cell extracts isolated from unstimulated and IL-1-treated HeLa cells were incubated with a recombinant GST-p65-(354–551) fusion protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. These experiments revealed constitutive and IL-1-inducible protein kinase activities. Mutations in Ser529 and Ser536, the sites that have been found as targets for the hitherto identified p65 TAD kinases IKKα and IKKβ (7Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol.

To profile phosphorylation sites in p65 the complete p65 coding sequence arrayed as overlapping 15-mer peptides was subjected to in vitro kinase assays with cell extracts from IL-1 stimulated HeLa cells. This approach revealed more than 20 peptides that were phosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 1B), including some that contained already identified phosphorylation sites such Ser536 (Fig. 1B, peptides H1–H3). 19 peptides that are indicated by white circles in Fig. 1B contained potentially novel phosphorylation sites and were selected for further study. To identify the phosphorylated amino acids within these 19 peptides, all threonine, serine, and tyrosine residues within these sequences were systematically mutated and tested for phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). In many peptides these mutations did not change in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Some peptides showed reduced phosphorylation upon mutation, and we are currently analyzing the significance of these sites (Fig. 1C). However, systematic replacement of threonine or serine residues in the peptide containing amino acids 463–477 (corresponding to peptide G5 in Fig. 1B) completely abolished in vitro phosphorylation in each peptide version in which serine 468 was mutated to alanine (Fig. 1C). The sequence SVDNS containing Ser468 is located within p65 transactivation domain 2 (TA2) (30Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and also comprises a classical GSK-3β motif (Ser/Thr-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-phospho-Ser/Thr) (31Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar), whereby the COOH-terminal amino acid contains a so-called priming phosphoamino acid (Fig. 1C). To directly address the question whether this consensus sequence is phosphorylated by recombinant GSK-3β in vitro, the purified kinase was incubated with a GST-p65-(354–551) substrate protein and a GST-p65-(354–551-Ser468-Ala) control protein where the phosphorylation site was point mutated. GSK-3β efficiently phosphorylated the GST-p65-(354–551) protein, while the GST-p65-(354–551-Ser468-Ala) mutant was phosphorylated to a minor extent (Fig. 2A), revealing GSK-3β as a serine 468 kinase. To obtain evidence for GSK-3β-mediated p65 serine 468 phosphorylation by an independent experimental approach, the products of the in vitro kinase assays were analyzed using an antibody specifically recognizing the phosphorylated form of serine 468. These experiments clearly confirmed that GSK-3β phosphorylated specifically Ser468, as no signal with the antibody was obtained using the S468A mutant protein as substrate or by omitting the substrate (Fig. 2B). Thus the experiments shown in Fig. 2 identify p65 Ser468 as a specific GSK-3β phosphorylation site in vitro. The residual phosphorylation observed in the radioactive kinase assay (Fig. 2A) and the detection of three proteins bands of different mobility on SDS-PAGE by immunoblotting with the phospho-Ser468-specific antibody (Fig. 2B) leave the possibility that the p65 TAD might contain additional GSK-3β sites as previously suggested by Schwabe and Brenner (23Schwabe R.F. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G204-G211Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To investigate whether GSK-3β phosphorylates Ser468in vivo, HeLa cells were stimulated with IL-1, TNF, or phorbol ester plus ionomycin, but phosphorylation of endogenous Ser468 was only faintly activated (data not shown). Intriguingly, treatment of cells with the PP1/PP2A Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (32Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Furuya-Suguri H. Yoshizawa S. Yasumoto S. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Sugimura T. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3521-3525PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min strongly induced Ser468 phosphorylation. These results can be reconciled with a recently suggested model whereby PP1 dephosphorylates GSK-3β at the NH2-terminal serine 9, thereby activating the kinase (33Zhang F. Phiel C.J. Spece L. Gurvich N. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33067-33077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In this model, mutual control is ensured by GSK-3β-mediated inhibition of the protein I-2, a negative regulator of PP1, thus maintaining GSK-3β in an active state in unstimulated cells. This mechanism also implies that inhibition of GSK-3β accelerates inactivation of PP1 by I-2 (33Zhang F. Phiel C.J. Spece L. Gurvich N. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33067-33077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed if inhibition of PP1 affects phosphorylation of GSK-3β in the cells employed in this study. Incubation of HeLa cells with calyculin A triggered the phosphorylation of GSK-3α at serine 21 and of GSK-3β at serine 9, as revealed by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes both enzymes (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 2). In this situation, addition of increasing amounts of LiCl, a specific inhibitor of GSK-3 (33Zhang F. Phiel C.J. Spece L. Gurvich N. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33067-33077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), further increased phosphorylation of GSK-3β and in parallel suppressed phosphorylation of Ser468 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3, lanes 3–5). Simultaneous detection of phosphorylated GSK-3α with the phospho-specific antibody showed that LiCl also impaired phosphorylation of GSK-3α (Fig. 3). However, as GSK-3α has not been implicated in in NF-κB activation (18Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar), its role in p65 phosphorylation was not further investigated in our study. In parallel, calyculin A also induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (Fig. 3, lane 2), which is in accordance with earlier studies (34Sun S.C. Maggirwar S.B. Harhaj E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18347-18351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These effects support the conclusion that a low level of kinase activity of GSK-3 and of IKKs is maintained in unstimulated cells whose effect on substrate phosphorylation is counteracted by high levels of phosphatase activity. With respect to p65, these experiments strongly implicate GSK-3β in phosphorylation of endogenous Ser468 and also suggest that a calyculin A-sensitive protein phosphatase regulates both NH2-terminal phosphorylation of GSK-3β and Ser468 phosphorylation of p65. Based on the experiments reported by Zhang et al. (33Zhang F. Phiel C.J. Spece L. Gurvich N. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33067-33077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) we suggest that PP1 is the phospho-Ser468 phosphatase. In our model a high level of active, dephosphorylated GSK-3β not only increases phosphorylation of Ser468 of p65 but at the same time also activates PP1, which dephosphorylates Ser468. To characterize the role of Ser468 functionally we ectopically expressed wild type p65 or the S468A mutant in p65-deficient cells. Under these conditions both proteins were expressed to comparable levels and were detectable within the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, in p65-deficient cells the S468A mutant showed a slightly faster mobility on SDS-PAGE compared with wild type p65 (Fig. 4A), a phenomen that was not observed when both proteins were transcribed and translated in vitro (data not shown). This observation is in line with a loss of GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation. When expressed in p65-negative cells, the S468A mutant displayed an about 4-fold increase in activation of a cotransfected NF-κB reporter gene as compared with wild type p65 (Fig. 4B). Expression of the S468A mutant also enhanced p65 activity induced by IL-1, TNF, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (data not shown). These experiments suggest that Ser468 phosphorylation by GSK-3β has a negative regulatory role for p65 activity the mechanism of which awaits further investigation. In summary, we provide strong evidence that Ser468 is a new phosphorylation site of p65 NF-κB and identify GSK-3β as the kinase that phosphorylates this residue in the absence of extracellular ligands. Ser468 phosphorylation may also play a role in response to certain specific stimuli as we found during the course of this work that T-cell costimulation induces Ser468 phosphorylation. However, the kinase that mediates this effect and its biological significance remain to be identified (35Schmitz M.L. Mattioli I. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Kracht M. Livingstone M. Blood. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Here, we suggest a function for GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of Ser468 in negative regulation of p65. Collectively, these results predict that the balance of active GSK-3β and PP1 determines the phosphorylation status of Ser468 in un-stimulated cells (see Fig. 5). In conjunction with other potential GSK-3β phosphorylation sites Ser468 may contribute to the altered constitutive activity of NF-κB that has been observed in chronic inflammatory disease (36Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar) and in different tumors (37Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar). Thus Ser468 phosphorylation maybe another crucially important determinant for the outcome of NF-κB activation in inflammation and cancer.

Although the role of PTP-1B in dephosphorylating various cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases is clear, the mechanisms by which it modulates receptor function from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remains an enigma. Here, we provide evidence that PTP-1B has an essential function in regulating the unfolded protein response in the ER compartment. The absence of PTP-1B caused impaired ER stress-induced IRE1 signaling.

This tyrosine phosphatase has been implicated in insulin, leptin, and growth hormone signaling pathways. Consequently, PTP-1B knock-out mice exhibit resistance to diet-induced diabetes and obesity, as well as enhanced growth hormone sensitivity (1Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W.

Tremblay M.L. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3753-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). PTP-1B is ubiquitously expressed and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via a C-terminal 35 amino acid sequence (6Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). It is not well understood how ER-localized PTP-1B could interact with cell surface receptors. The specific localization of PTP-1B in the ER compartment prompted us to investigate the possible role of PTP-1B in signaling pathways emanating directly from the ER membrane.The ER is responsible for the folding and assembly of secretory proteins. Several cellular conditions such as high demand for protein secretion, nutrient/oxygen deprivation, viral infection, or the presence of certain genetic mutations lead to defects in protein folding in the ER (7Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). This results in the accumulation of improperly folded proteins in the ER lumen, which induces an adaptive signaling response known as the “unfolded protein response” (UPR) (8Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar, 9Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25935-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Two ER resident type I transmembrane protein kinases, IRE1 and PERK, mediate this stress response. Under basal conditions, they are maintained inactive by their association with the molecular chaperone Bip/Grp78 through their luminal domain. When improperly folded proteins accumulate in the ER, Bip dissociates from IRE1 and PERK, and as a consequence, IRE1 and PERK undergo homo-oligomerization and serine/threonine trans-phosphorylation resulting in their activation (10Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar, 11Liu C.Y. Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER initiates three downstream signaling events. First, phosphorylated IRE1 recruits the adaptor protein TRAF2 resulting in the downstream activation of JNK through ASK-1 (12Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar, 13Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Moreover, IRE1 possesses an endoribonuclease activity that triggers the unconventional splicing of the transcription factor XBP-1 mRNA (14Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2904) Google Scholar, 15Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The resulting mRNA is then translated into a stable protein that activates the transcription of EDEM (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein) gene, a component of the ER-associated degradation machinery (17Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Furthermore, following ER stress the basal association of IRE1 with the adaptor molecule Nck is disrupted, leading to ERK activation (27Nguyen D.T. Kebache S. Fazel A. Wong H.N. Jenna S. Emadali A. Lee E. Bergeron J.J.M. Kaufman R.J. Larose L. Chevet E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4248-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Second, stress-induced oligomerization of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like kinase (PERK) leads to its activation and consequently to eIF-2α phosphorylation, thus attenuating protein translation to reduce the ER load (18Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar, 19Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A third component of the ER stress signaling is the transmembrane protein ATF6. The basic leucine-zipper transcription factor contained in its cytoplasmic domain is cleaved in the Golgi apparatus upon ER stress to activate the transcription of specific transcription factors, including XBP-1, ER chaperones, and folding enzyme (14Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2904) Google Scholar, 20Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R.

J. 2002; 366: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Together, these different signaling pathways synergize to promote folding and/or degradation of the misfolded proteins. Prolonged and severe ER stress, however, will eventually lead to apoptosis and cell death through the activation of JNK, caspase-12 cleavage (except in human where caspase-12 is a pseudo-gene) and CHOP expression, downstream of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 (13Nishitoh H.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar).In the current report, we investigated the role of PTP-1B in ER stress. The absence of PTP-1B caused impaired IRE1-dependent JNK activation as well as XBP-1 splicing and EDEM transcription, which were reduced in immortalized (MEFs) or primary (PMEFs) PTP-1B knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The effect of PTP1B on signaling through IRE1 was dependent on its tyrosine phosphatase activity. Finally, ER stress-induced apoptosis was attenuated upon prolonged stress in PTP-1B knock-out cells. Our results thus demonstrate that PTP-1B has an active physiological role in the ER compartment and that it has an important function in potentiating IRE1-mediated ER stress signaling pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Reagents were from Fisher Biotech unless otherwise indicated. Monoclonal antibodies against TC-PTP were described previously (5Gu F. Dube N. Kim J.W. Cheng A. Ibarra-Sanchez Mde J. Tremblay M.L. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3753-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Calnexin antibody was a gift from Dr. John Bergeron (McGill University). Other antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies (PTP-1B), Cell Signaling (phospho-SAPK/JNK T183/Y185, phospho-p38MAPK T180/Y182, phospho-eIF2α S51, p38MAPK), Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (JNK-1). Azetidine-2 carboxylic acid (Azc) was from Sigma. Tunicamycin (Tun), 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetate (BAPTA), and anisomycin were from Calbiochem.Cell Culture and Isolation of Primary Embryonic Fibroblasts—Spontaneously immortalized PTP-1B and TC-PTP WT MEFs (PTP-1B+/+ MEFs and TC-PTP+/+ MEFs, respectively) and corresponding knock-out MEFs (PTP-1B–/– MEFs and TC-PTP–/– MEFs, respectively) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) as described (5Gu F. Dube N. Kim J.W. Cheng A. Ibarra-Sanchez Mde J. Tremblay M.L. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3753-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). PTP-1B “rescued” cell lines were obtained by re-introducing a Myc-tagged murine PTP-1B either WT (“rescue” R3 and R5) or bearing a D181A mutation (“rescue” D181A) in the PTP-1B–/– MEFs by retroviral infection and selection with hygromycin (75 μg/ml). PTP-1B+/+ and PTP-1B–/– PMEFs were isolated from E14 embryos and pairs of WT, and knock-out embryos were selected from the same litter from the heterozygous parents. Embryos were genotyped by Southern blot.ER Stress Treatment, Preparation of Cell Lysates, and Immunoblot— Cells were grown to ∼80% confluence. Azc (10 mm) or Tun (10 μg/ml) was added for the indicated period of time, and cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Na deoxycholate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method, and ∼25 μg of proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot with specific antibodies.RT-PCR—After the same ER stress treatment as described above, the expression of BiP, CHOP, XBP-1, EDEM, and GAPDH was assessed by semiquantitative RT-PCR as described previously (27Nguyen D.T. Kebache S. Fazel A. Wong H.N. Jenna S. Emadali A. Lee E. Bergeron J.J.M. Kaufman R.J. Larose L. Chevet E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4248-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides used were: 5′-GGGAAAGAAGGTTACCCATGC and 5′-CGAGTAGATCCACCAACCAGAG for BiP, 5′-CCCTGCCTTTCACCTTGG and 5′-CCGCTCGTTCTCCTGCTC for CHOP, 5′-AACTCCAGCTAGAAAATCAGC and 5′-CCATGGGAAGATGTTCTGGG for XBP-1, 5′ GCCTAACCCCATCCACTGCC and 5′ CCAGGAGGGAACCGGTCCC for EDEM, and 5′-ACCACCATGGAGAAGGCTGG and 5′-CTCAGTGTAGCCCAGGATGC for GAPDH.Cell Survival and Apoptosis Analysis—MEFs were grown to ∼80% confluence. Azc (10 mm) or Tun (10 μg/ml) was added for 24 h, and contrast phase photographs of cells were taken. Alternatively, PMEFs were grown and treated with Azc (2.5 mm) and Tun (10 μg/ml) for 12 h, and apoptosis was determined by Annexin V staining using the manufacturer's recommendations (BIOSOURCE). Cells were analyzed using a FACscan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).RESULTSImpaired ER Stress-mediated Stress Kinase Activation in PTP-1B Knock-out Fibroblasts—PTP-1B associates with the ER membrane via its C-terminal 35 amino acids and exposes its tyrosine phosphatase domain on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane (6Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Although most of the substrates of PTP-1B localize at the plasma membrane, PTP-1B was not known to relocate to this compartment, neither at steady state nor upon EGF, PDGF, or insulin stimulation (24Haj F.G. Verveer P.J. Squire A. Neel B.G. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2002; 295: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 25Romsicki Y. Reece M. Gauthier J.Y. Asante-Appiah E. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12868-12875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, we did not observe any noticeable change in ER localization of PTP-1B during growth hormone stimulation (supplementary Fig. 1).The ER localization of PTP-1B prompted us to examine its possible involvement in ER stress signaling. We induced ER stress using either Azc, a proline analogue containing a 4-carbon ring, or Tun, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation that prevents transfer of the oligosaccharide moiety from dolichol phosphate to newly synthesized protein. PTP-1B+/+ and PTP-1B–/– MEFs were treated with Azc and Tun for the indicated periods of time. Immunoblot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies against JNK and p38MAPK showed a strong activation of JNK and p38MAPK in WT cells after 3–6 h of Azc treatment (Fig. 1A) or after 12–16 h of Tun treatment (Fig. 1B). However, the activation of JNK and p38MAPK was almost undetectable in the PTP-1B–/– MEFs treated with either drug (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, anisomycin, a potent JNK agonist stimulated JNK and p38MAPK phosphorylation in the PTP-1B knock-out cells to the same extent as in WT cells, showing that there is no intrinsic defect in JNK or p38MAPK activation in the absence of PTP-1B (Fig. 1B). As a control of specificity, we postulated that the absence of the closely related phosphatase TC-PTP should not reduce JNK or p38MAPK activation (26Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Indeed, when TC-PTP–/– MEFs were treated with Azc or Tun, JNK and p38MAPK activation was indistinguishable from the TC-PTP+/+ MEFs cells (Fig. 1C), thus demonstrating that PTP-1B, but not TC-PTP, is involved in ER stress kinase activation (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the inhibition of JNK and p38MAPK activation was indeed caused by the absence of PTP-1B, Myc-tagged PTP-1B was re-expressed in PTP-1B–/– MEFs using retroviral infection (rescue). Rescued cells had lower expression levels of PTP-1B than WT cells, but this amount was sufficient to restore JNK and p38MAPK activation in response to Azc. This result was observed in two different rescued cell lines R5 and R3 (Fig. 1D). Overall, our data indicate that PTP-1B is specifically involved in the activation of stress kinases in response to ER stress.Impaired IRE1 Signaling in Primary PTP-1B Knock-out Cells—Immortalization of MEF cells often involves uncontrolled mutations and deletions, resulting in indirect phenotypes. To rule out these effects, we isolated primary fibroblasts derived from PTP-1B+/+ and PTP-1B–/– mouse embryos (PMEFs). Two different pairs of WT and knock-out PMEFs were isolated and treated with Azc and activation of JNK and p38MAPK in WT PMEFs was detected after 3–6 h, similarly to what was observed in the immortalized cells (Fig. 2A). However, JNK and p38MAPK activation were largely reduced in both pairs of PTP-1B knock-out PMEFs after the same treatment (Fig. 2A). These results confirmed the direct role of PTP-1B in stress kinase activation. Since JNK activation is induced downstream of IRE1 activation, our results suggest a role of PTP-1B in IRE1 signaling pathway.Fig. 2PTP-1B tyrosine phosphatase activity is essential for IRE1 signaling.A, primary fibroblasts isolated from #2 WT and #7 knock-out embryo from one litter together with #5 WT and #7 knock-out embryo from a second litter were treated with 10 mm Azc for 3 or 6 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot using the indicated antibodies. B, Bip, CHOP, XBP-1, and EDEM transcriptions were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR after 3 or 6 h treatment of 10 mm Azc or 10 μg/ml Tun on #2 WT and #7 knock-out primary MEFs. C, as described for A, except that cells were treated 30 min with 10 μg/ml Tun or 2.5 μm BAPTA for 30 min, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with phospho-specific antibody against eIF2α and other indicated antibodies. D, immortalized PTP-1B+/+ MEFs, PTP-1B–/– MEFs, and PTP-1B–/– MEFs re-expressing a Myc-PTP-1B carrying a point mutation in PTP-1B tyrosine phosphatase domain (PTP-1B–/– rescue D181A) were treated with Azc for the indicated periods of time. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot using the indicated antibodies. E, XBP-1 transcription was measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR after treatment of immortalized PTP-1B+/+, PTP-1B–/– and PTP-1B D181A mutant rescued PTP-1B–/– MEFs with 10 mm Azc or 10 μg/ml Tun for 6 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Analysis of gene expression profiles by RT-PCR revealed that Grp78/Bip and CHOP mRNA expression levels increased 3–6 h after Azc and Tun treatments in both WT and PTP-1B knock-out PMEFs (Fig. 2B). This suggested no obvious defect in the transcriptional activation of these two genes in the absence of PTP-1B. In contrast, after 3–6 h of Azc or Tun treatment, although the total XBP-1 mRNA expression level (unspliced + spliced forms) increased to a similar extent in both WT and PTP-1B knock-out PMEFs, XBP-1 mRNA splicing was dramatically reduced in the PTP-1B–/– cells (Fig. 2B). The expression product of the spliced XBP-1 is a transcription factor whose major target is EDEM (17Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Because of the reduced level of XBP-1 splicing in PTP-1B knock-out primary fibroblasts, we measured EDEM mRNA expression levels in both WT and PTP1B knock-out cells. While EDEM mRNA expression was induced in response to Azc or Tun treatment in WT cells, no induction was observed in PTP-1B knock-out cells (Fig. 2B). A similar defect in XBP-1 splicing was also obtained in immortalized PTP-1B knock-out MEFs (supplementary Fig. 2). The unconventional splicing of XBP-1 is an event directly triggered by IRE1 endoribonuclease activity (15Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). Together, these experiments led us to conclude that PTP-1B is involved in activation of IRE1 signaling upstream of stress kinase activation and XBP-1 splicing in response to ER stress.To establish whether PTP-1B was also involved in other ER stress-mediated signaling pathways, we assessed PERK activation by measuring the phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser51 in response to ER stress in both PTP-1B+/+ and PTP-1B–/– PMEFs. Phosphorylation of eIF2α was activated quickly (30 min) after treatment with Tun or the calcium chelator BAPTA, and no difference was observed between cell types (Fig. 2C). This result is in agreement with the fact that we did not observe a significant difference in Bip and CHOP gene transcription, which are indirectly controlled by PERK activation (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that PTP-1B specifically participates in IRE1-mediated but not in PERK-mediated signaling pathways. Moreover, the similarity in the induction of total XBP-1 transcription in WT and PTP-1B knock-out cells suggests that the ATF6 pathway is not significantly altered in the absence of PTP-1B. Primary cells therefore provide direct and physiologically relevant evidence that PTP-1B is specifically involved in IRE1 signaling pathways in response to ER stress.To test whether the inhibition of ER stress-induced JNK and p38MAPK activation as well as the reduction of XBP-1 splicing were caused by PTP-1B tyrosine phosphatase activity, PTP-1B–/– MEFs were subjected to retroviral infection with a virus encoding a Myc-tagged PTP-1B carrying an inactivating point mutation in the tyrosine phosphatase domain (rescue D181A). The PTP-1B D181A rescued cells, along with PTP-1B WT and knock-out MEFs, were treated with 10 mm Azc for up to 9 h. The reduced activation of JNK and p38MAPK that was observed previously in the PTP-1B–/– MEFs (Fig. 1, A and B) was not reversed by re-expression of the PTP-1B D181A mutant in these cells (Fig. 2D). Since similar expression levels of WT PTP-1B in PTP-1B–/– cells were sufficient to rescue the impaired activation of both stress kinases (Fig. 1D), the absence of a similar effect in PTP-1B D181A rescued cells is likely due to the mutation itself. In addition, these cells were as inefficient as the PTP-1B–/– MEFs in mediating XBP-1 splicing upon Azc or Tun stress (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results indicate that in response to ER stress PTP-1B tyrosine phosphatase activity is required for the activation of IRE1 signaling leading to XBP-1 splicing and activation of JNK and p38MAPK.Enhanced Resistance to ER Stress-induced Apoptosis in PTP-1B Knock-out Cells—The activation of pro-apoptotic JNK and p38MAPK contributes to ER stress-induced apoptosis and cell death. Because of the reduced activation of JNK and p38MAPK in the absence of PTP-1B, we postulated that prolonged ER stress might lead to reduced apoptosis in PTP-1B–/– cells. Immortalized PTP-1B+/+ and PTP-1B–/– MEFs were incubated 24 h with Tun or Azc and analyzed by phase contrast microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A, most of the WT cells were dead after 24 h of treatment with either 10 μg/ml Tun or 10 mm Azc, whereas a significant proportion of PTP-1B–/– cells were still alive (Fig. 3A). To quantitatively assess the extent of ER stress-induced apoptosis, we measured Tun- and Azc-induced apoptosis in PMEFs by flow cytometry using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Annexin V antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3B, ∼14% of the WT PMEFs was early apoptotic (Annexin V-positive, propidium iodine-negative) after 12 h treatment with 10 μg/ml Tun, whereas only ∼9.6% of the PTP-1B–/– PMEFs were early apoptotic. Similarly, after 12 h of 2.5 mm Azc treatment, the early apoptotic population was ∼16% in WT cells versus ∼11% for PTP-1B–/– cells. Overall, these results show that PTP-1B–/– cells are more tolerant to ER stress-induced apoptosis.Fig. 3PTP-1B knock-out fibroblasts are more resistant to ER stress induced apoptosis.A, PTP-1B+/+ and PTP-1B–/– MEFs were treated with 10 μg/ml Tun or 10 mm Azc for 24 h. Phase contrast pictures of the cells were taken. B, primary fibroblasts #5 (PTP-1B+/+) and #1 (PTP-1B–/–) were treated with 10 μg/ml Tun or 2.5 mm Azc for 12 h, and apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry after cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodine. The average of the percentage of early apoptotic (Annexin V-positive and propidium iodine-negative) population as well as other cell populations were calculated from more than three experiments, and standard deviations are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate that the absence of PTP-1B impairs IRE1 signaling in response to ER stress. This was reflected by the attenuation of JNK and p38MAPK activation, the defect in XBP-1 splicing, and the subsequent absence of EDEM transcription in both PTP-1B knock-out fibroblasts and primary cells isolated from PTP-1B knock-out embryos. Since JNK activation and XBP-1 splicing are triggered by activated IRE1 through its serine/threonine kinase and endoribonuclease activities, our results indicate that PTP-1B is involved in IRE1 signaling. In addition, our results suggest that a functional tyrosine phosphatase domain is required for PTP-1B to mediate this effect. IRE1, however, is not known to be directly regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, our data point to a mechanism in which PTP-1B tyrosine phosphatase activity indirectly promotes the activation of IRE1 in response to ER stress. Indeed, we have observed the presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated with the ER under basal and stress conditions. 2E. Chevet, unpublished observations. Moreover, signaling molecules such as Ras and c-Abl were found to be associated with the ER membrane (28Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 29Ito Y. Pandey P. Mishra N. Kumar S. Narula N. Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6233-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The possible role of these proteins in ER stress signaling is not well understood, but PTP-1B may be required to maintain the correct phosphorylation state of these, or other, targets on the ER membrane during IRE1 signaling. On the other hand, PTP-1B contains two proline-rich domains that have the potential to interact with Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins. Recently, the Src homology 3-containing adaptor protein Nck has been shown to directly interact with IRE1 and may therefore represent a potential binding partner for PTP-1B (27Nguyen D.T. Kebache S. Fazel A. Wong H.N. Jenna S. Emadali A. Lee E. Bergeron J.J.M. Kaufman R.J. Larose L. Chevet E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4248-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether PTP1B, in addition to its catalytic function, could contribute to IRE1 signaling by acting as a scaffold, assembling components of a signaling complex at the ER membrane.Surprisingly, although the ER stress-mediated adaptive response (i.e. XBP-1 splicing and EDEM transcriptional response) was reduced in PTP-1B–/– cells, these cells were more resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis. This phenomenon may result from unbalanced signaling of pro-survival and proapoptotic pathways in PTP-1B–/– cells when exposed to prolonged and severe stress. Indeed, we believe that although the XBP-1/EDEM axis is defective, PERK- and ATF6-mediated UPR pathways remain functional allowing PTP-1B knock-out cells to cope with the early phases of ER stress. Our results suggest that the reduced activation of major pro-apoptotic stress kinases (JNK/p38MAPK) finally results in a dominant effect on cell survival in PTP-1B knock-out cells.In carrying out these studies, we have made a first step in the elucidation of an active role for PTP-1B in mediating signaling pathways emanating from the ER membrane. We hope that more studies will follow to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of its involvement in IRE1-mediated ER stress signaling.

Central to this is a segment of the structure, which closes like a “lid” over bound ATP, promoting N-terminal dimerization and assembly of a competent active site. Hsp90 mutants that influence these conformational switches have strong effects on ATPase activity. ATPase activity is specifically regulated by Hsp90 co-chaperones, which directly influence the conformational switches. Here we have analyzed the effect of Hsp90 mutations on binding (using isothermal titration calorimetry and difference circular dichroism) and ATPase regulation by the co-chaperones Aha1, Sti1 (Hop), and Sba1 (p23). The ability of Sti1 to bind Hsp90 and arrest its ATPase activity was not affected by any of the mutants screened. Sba1 bound in the presence of AMPPNP to wild-type and ATPase hyperactive mutants with similar affinity but only very weakly to hypoactive mutants despite their wild-type ATP affinity. Unexpectedly, in all cases Sba1 bound to Hsp90 with a 1:2 molar stoichiometry. Aha1 binding to mutants was similar to wild-type, but the -fold activation of their ATPase varied substantially between mutants. Analysis of complex formation with co-chaperone mixtures showed Aha1 and p50cdc37 able to bind Hsp90 simultaneously but without direct interaction. Sba1 and p50cdc37 bound independently to Hsp90-AMPPNP but not together. These data indicated that Sba1 and Aha1 regulate Hsp90 by influencing the conformational state of the “ATP lid” and consequent N-terminal dimerization, whereas Sti1 does not.

Hsp90 also possesses a potential lid segment (Gly100-Gly121 in yeast Hsp90), which is larger than the equivalents in GyrB and MutL, and unlike those has a fully ordered open conformation in the absence of nucleotide. Although the structure of Hsp90 with bound ATP (or AMPNP) has not yet been directly observed, biochemical and mutagenesis studies (6Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R.

A number of mutations isolated either through genetic screens (14Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell.

Thus the T101I mutation within the lid segment appears to stabilize the ATP lid in the open conformation seen in crystal structures of the isolated N-terminal domain (9Prodromou C. Roe S.M.

A107N, also within the lid segment, probably stabilizes the closed conformation greatly enhancing ATP turnover and N-terminal dimerization. T22I, which also enhances ATPase activity, probably does not affect lid closure directly but favors consequent association of the N-terminal domains. Mutations in residues outside the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain, in particular Phe349 in the middle segment, have also been found to have significant effects on ATPase activity (10Meyer P. Prodromou C. Hu B. Vaughan C. Panaretou B. Piper W.P. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). How the F349A mutation causes a substantial drop in catalytic activity is not certain, but it is likely that Phe349 contributes to the interface between the middle segment and the exposed hydrophobic face of the ATP lid in its closed state. The inherent ATPase activity of Hsp90 is also greatly influenced by some of the co-chaperones with which it cooperates in the activation of client proteins in vivo. Aha1 (and the related Hch1) is an activator of the ATPase of Hsp90 able to stimulate the inherent activity of yeast Hsp90 by ∼12-fold and human Hsp90β by ∼50-fold (17Panaretou B. Siligardi G.

Circular Dichroism and Kd Determinations—CD spectra were recorded on a nitrogen-flushed JASCO J720 spectropolarimeter as described previously (21Siligardi G. Panaretou B. Meyer P. Singh S.

Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically using the following extinction coefficients: ϵ(Hsp90, T22I, T101I, A107N, and F349A) = 54,050; ϵ(Sba1) = 28,650; ϵ(Cp50) = 26,390; and ϵ(Aha1) = 50,160. The theory and method of difference circular dichroism for investigating protein interactions has been described in detail previously (21Siligardi G. Panaretou B. Meyer P. Singh S. Woolfson D.N.

Sti1 Binding and ATPase Regulation of Hsp90 Mutants— Sti1 is a potent inhibitor of the Hsp90 ATPase activity, but the precise mechanism by which it achieves this is unknown (20Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 23Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10328-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the Hsp90-Sti1 interaction as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is most probably 1:1 (Fig. 1), indicating that one Sti1 dimer interacts with one dimeric Hsp90 molecule, which is consistent with previous observations (20Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The Kd for the binding of Sti1 to wild-type Hsp90 was determined by ITC as 0.24 μm (Fig. 1A), consistent with previous results (20Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Kd values determined with Hsp90 mutants (T22I, Kd = 0.18 μm; T101I, Kd = 0.18 μm; A107N, Kd = 0.41 μm; F349A, Kd = 0.13 μm) suggest that none of the mutations significantly modify the binding of Sti1 (Fig. 1). Although the binding of Sti1 was unaffected, its ability to inhibit the ATPase activity of the Hsp90 mutants might still be compromised. ATPase assays showed that Sti1 inhibited the ATPase activity of the T22I and A107N mutants to the same degree as wild-type (Fig. 2A). Sti1 inhibition assays with the Hsp90 T101I and F349A mutants were not possible because of their inherently low ATPase activity. Although the primary binding site for Sti1 maps to the extreme C terminus of Hsp90, the perturbation of the CD spectrum of Hsp90-bound geldanamycin by Sti1 clearly indicates that ATPase arrest by Sti1 involves a direct interaction with the N-terminal domain (20Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) but without preventing nucleotide binding (23Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10328-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). That the A107N mutation does not affect Sti1 binding to Hsp90, nor the ability of Sti1 to arrest the ATPase when bound, suggests that the mechanism of ATPase arrest by Sti1 is distinct from that of p50/Cdc37, which binds specifically to the open conformation of the ATP lid in the N-domain and prevents its closure (22Roe S.M. Ali M.M. Meyer P. Vaughan C.K. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2004; 116: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lack of the effect of the F349A mutation on Sti1 binding also suggests that arrest by Sti1-mediated ATPase arrest does not involve interference with communications between the N-terminal domain and the middle segment of Hsp90. It is likely that structural studies will be required to fully understand the inhibitory function of Sti1. Sba1 Binding and ATPase Regulation of Hsp90 Mutants—In the presence of saturating AMPPNP, the binding of Sba1 to mutants previously shown to favor an association of the N-terminal domains (T22I, Kd = 2.91 μm; A107N, Kd = 3.69 μm) was comparable to that with wild-type Hsp90 (Kd = 1.75 μm) (Fig. 3). As binding to the T22I mutant evolved relatively small heats and therefore gave a less reliable ITC, its affinity for Sba1 was also measured by difference CD, (Kd = 1.5 μm), and found to be similar to that of wild-type Hsp90 (ITC, Kd = 1.75 μm; CD, Kd = 1.16 μm) (Figs. 3, A and B and 4, A–E). Unexpectedly, in all cases the observed stoichiometry for the interaction of Sba1 with Hsp90, in both ITC and CD measurements, was close to 1:2 (Sba1:Hsp90) (Figs. 3 and 4, A–C). As previously seen for wild-type Hsp90 (17Panaretou B. Siligardi G. Meyer P. Maloney A. Sullivan J.K. Singh S. Millson S.H. Clarke P.A. Naaby-Hansen S. Stein R. Cramer R. Mollapour M. Workman P.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1307-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), the ATPase activity of the T22I and A107N mutants could be partially inhibited by Sba1 (Fig. 2B). The interaction of Sba1 with the T101I (Kd = 11.4 μm) and F349A (Kd = 22.2 μm) mutants was significantly weaker than with wild-type Hsp90 (Kd = 1.75 μm) (Figs. 3 and 4, A, B, H, and I). The Kd for the binding of AMPPNP to the T101I (37 μm) and F349A mutants (56.1 μm) (Fig. 4, E and F) is similar to Hsp90 (37 μm) (15Prodromou C. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), so that their lower affinity for Sba1 is not because of a defect in ATP binding itself but rather because of an impaired ability to adopt a stable N terminally dimerized conformation on the binding of ATP to which Sba1 then binds. ATPase assays with the F349A and T101I mutants were not conducted because of their inherently low ATPase activities and lack of interaction with Sba1.Fig. 4Near-UV CD analysis of the Hsp90 and Hsp90 ts-mutant interactions with AMPPNP and Sba1. A, near UV-difference CD spectra for titration of Sba1 into Hsp90-AMPPNP (50 and 100 μm, respectively), obtained by subtracting the spectra of the free Sba1 at n molar equivalents, from Hsp90-AMPPNP-Sba1 mixtures at Hsp90:Sba1 molar ratios of 1:n.

Changes in the difference spectra are consistent with changes in the environment of aromatic residues because of molecular interaction. B, K estimation for the binding of Sba1 to Hsp90-AMPPNP. The titration was continued to saturation and yields a Kd of 1.16 μm, which is consistent with the ITC data (Kd = 1.75 μm).

The spectrum for the T22I-AMPPNP complex is indicated, and curves a–h are from T22I:Sba1 mixtures in the molar ratio of 1:n (n = 0.12, 0.25, 0.38, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0). Changes in the difference spectra are consistent with changes in the environment of aromatic residues due to molecular interaction. E, Kd estimation for the binding of Sba1 to T22I-AMPPNP. The titration was continued to saturation and yields a Kd of 1.5 μm, which is consistent with the ITC data (Kd = 2.91 μm). F, near UV-difference CD spectra for titration of AMPPNP into F349A (145 μm), obtained by subtracting the spectra of the free AMPPNP at n molar equivalents, from F349A-AMPPNP mixtures at F349A:AMPPNP molar ratios of 1:n. The spectrum for the F349A-AMPPNP complex is indicated, and curves a–f are from F349A:AMPPNP mixtures in the molar ratio of 1:n (n = 0.50, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0). Changes in the difference spectra are consistent with changes in the environment of aromatic residues because of molecular interaction. G, Kd estimation for the AMPPNP interaction with F349A. The titration was continued to saturation and yields a Kd of 56.1 μm, which is slightly higher than that for Hsp90 (37 μm). H, near UV-difference CD spectra for titration of Sba1 into F349A-AMPPNP (50.4 and 100.8 μm, respectively), obtained by subtracting the spectra of the free Sba1 at n molar equivalents, from F349A-AMPPNP-Sba1 mixtures at F349A:Sba1 molar ratios of 1:n. The spectrum for the F349A-AMPPNP complex is indicated, and curves a–h are from F349A:Sba1 mixtures in the molar ratio of 1:n (n = 0.12, 0.25, 0.38, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0). Changes in the difference spectra are consistent with changes in the environment of aromatic residues due to molecular interaction. I, Kd estimation for the binding of Sba1 to F349A-AMPPNP.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) but has not previously been quantified. When AMPPNP was omitted, Sba1 binding to wild-type Hsp90 was ∼70-fold weaker (Kd = 120 μm in ITC). Tighter binding was observed with the A107N mutant (Kd = 19.2 μm) (Fig. 5), which displays an enhanced N-terminal dimerization (6Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this was still significantly weaker than the affinity for wild-type or A107N Hsp90s in the presence of AMPPNP. These results are fully consistent with previous suggestions that Sba1 (and p23) binding to Hsp90 is not dependent on ATP binding to Hsp90 per se but is dependent on the N-terminal association that ATP binding promotes (13Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. McMahon N. Catelli M.G. Toft D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15Prodromou C. Roe S.M.

Most surprising however was the stoichiometry observed for the Sba1-Hsp90 interaction in both ITC and ΔCD measurements, which showed that a single Sba1 molecule binds to an Hsp90 dimer. Monomer-dimer interactions are rare, but not unknown (27Yeh B.K. Igarashi M. Eliseenkova A.V. Plotnikov A.N. Sher I. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Mohammadi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the case of Hsp90 and Sba1 the sites involved are yet to be determined. However, such an interaction would clearly stabilize Hsp90-client protein complexes by promoting the N-terminal dimeric state. The monomeric state of Sba1 is consistent with human p23 studies (29Weaver A.J. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2007226629,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. Following its induction, TNFalpha gene transcription is rapidly attenuated, in part due to the accumulation of NF-kappaB p50 homodimers that bind to three kappaB sites in the TNFalpha promoter. Here we have investigated the inhibitory role of BCL-3, an IkappaB-like protein that interacts exclusively with p50 and p52 homodimers. BCL-3 was induced by LPS with delayed kinetics and was associated with p50 in the nucleus. Forced expression of BCL-3 suppressed LPS-induced transcription from the TNFalpha promoter and inhibited two artificial promoters composed of TNFalphakappaB sites that preferentially bind p50 dimers. BCL-3-mediated repression was reversed by trichostatin A and was enhanced by overexpression of HDAC-1, indicating that transcriptional attenuation involves recruitment of histone deacetylase. Analysis of macrophages from p50 and BCL-3 knock-out mice revealed that both transcription factors negatively regulate TNFalpha expression and that BCL-3 inhibits IL-1alpha and IL-1beta. In contrast, induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was reduced in BCL-3 null macrophages. BCL-3 was not required for the production of p50 homodimers but BCL-3 expression was severely diminished in p50-deficient cells. Together, these findings indicate that p50 and BCL-3 function as anti-inflammatory regulators in macrophages by attenuating transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activating IL-10 expression."

Perception of stress signals or of pathogen-derived molecules, called elicitors, activates a number of signal transduction steps in plants, eventually leading to the transcriptional activation of numerous genes, and consequently to de novo synthesis of a variety of defense proteins and protective secondary metabolites (1Nimchuk Z. Eulgem T. Holt B.F. II I Dangl J.F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 579-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar).

In elicitor-induced accumulation of secondary metabolites, jasmonic acid and its volatile methyl-ester methyljasmonate (MeJA), have been shown to act as intermediate signals (3Memelink J. Verpoorte R. Kijne J.W. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 212-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms regulating elicitor-responsive expression of secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes is limited. In parsley, a fungal elicitor induces the expression of the MYB-like transcription factor box P-binding factor (BPF)-1, which interacts with the promoter of a gene encoding the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (4da Costa e Silva O. Klein L. Schmelzer E. Trezzini G.F. Hahlbrock K. Plant J. 1993; 4: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis in Catharanthus roseus is one of the best studied elicitor-induced secondary metabolic pathways. In suspension cells, the perception of yeast extract (YE) leads to the activation of terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis (5Moreno P.R.H. van der Heijden R. Verpoorte R. Plant Cell Tissue Org. Cult. 1995; 42: 1-25Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Two genes involved in terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis, encoding strictosidine synthase (STR) and tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC), are coordinately regulated and their mRNAs accumulate transiently after YE treatment (6Pasquali G. Goddijn O.J.M. de Waal A. Verpoorte R. Schilperoort R.A. Hoge J.H.C. Memelink J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 7Roewer I.A. Cloutier C. Nessler C.L. De Luca V. Plant Cell Rep. 1992; 11: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Induction of these genes by YE is mediated by protein phosphorylation, the influx of calcium, and the biosynthesis of JA via the octadecanoid pathway (3Memelink J. Verpoorte R. Kijne J.W.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the STR promoter, two elicitor- and jasmonate-responsive sequences have been identified; the so-called BA region and a sequence close to the TATA box, called jasmonate- and elicitor-responsive element, located in the RV region (see Fig. 8). The BA region was found to bind to a homologue of parsley PcBPF-1, called CrBPF1 (9van der Fits L. Zhang H. Menke F.L.H. Deneka M. Memelink J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The jasmonate- and elicitor-responsive element interacts with two JA-responsive transcription factors called ORCA2 and ORCA3 (10Menke F.L.H. Champion A. Kijne J.W. Memelink J.

Both ORCAs belong to the APETALA2/ethylene response-factor (AP2/ERF) family of transcription factors. ORCA3 was shown to regulate multiple genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism, including the TDC and STR genes (3Memelink J. Verpoorte R. Kijne J.W.

The NR region of the STR promoter, which is not required for responsiveness to elicitor or jasmonate (10Menke F.L.H. Champion A. Kijne J.W. Memelink J.

The TDC promoter also contains a YE-responsive element, the so-called DB element (14Ouwerkerk P.B.F. Memelink J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ORCA transcription factors 2J. Memelink, unpublished results. or the MYB-related protein CrBPF1 (9van der Fits L. Zhang H. Menke F.L.H. Deneka M. Memelink J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) do not bind to the DB element, whereas CrGBFs have a weak affinity for a G-box-like sequence in the DB element in vitro (13Sibéril Y.

To isolate transcription factors that interact with the DB element, a yeast one-hybrid screening was performed. This screening identified three members of the transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA-type; Cys2/His2-type) zinc finger protein family from C. roseus, ZCT1, ZCT2, and ZCT3. In vitro DNA binding studies showed that these proteins bind in a sequence-specific manner to the TDC and STR promoters. Furthermore, these zinc finger proteins were shown to act as transcriptional repressors of STR and TDC promoter activity in trans-activation assays. Finally, expression of these zinc finger genes is rapidly induced by YE and MeJA. Together these data show that TFIIIA-type zinc finger transcription factors can act as repressors in the regulation of YE-induced secondary metabolism. Isolation of Zinc Finger Clones—cDNA fragments encoding zinc finger proteins ZCT1, ZCT2, and ZCT3 were isolated by a one-hybrid screening of a C. roseus cDNA library with the DB element of the TDC promoter as bait. Tetramerization of the DB element from the TDC promoter was described in (14Ouwerkerk P.B.F. Memelink J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The DB tetramer was fused to the yeast HIS3 reporter gene in plasmid p601 (15Grueneberg D.A. Natesan S. Alexandre C. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1992; 257: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The tetramer-HIS3 fusion was transferred as a BamHI fragment into the BclI site of integration vector pJP04, which is essentially similar to pINT1 (16Meijer A.H. Ouwerkerk P.B. F Hoge J.H.C. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was linearized with NcoI and introduced into yeast strain Y187 (17Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar). Recombinants were selected on YPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) medium containing 150 μg/ml G418, and the occurrence of single recombination events between the pJP04 derivative and the chromosomal PDC6 locus was verified by Southern blot analysis. The pACTII cDNA library with a complexity of 3.5 × 106 independent transformants was prepared from elicitor-treated C. roseus cell suspension line MP183L as described by Ref. 10Menke F.L.H. Champion A. Kijne J.W. Memelink J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar. After transformation of the cDNA library into the yeast strain, cells were plated on minimal medium lacking leucine and histidine. Screening of an estimated total number of 2.4 × 106 yeast transformants resulted in 188 colonies containing plasmids conferring His/Leu-independent growth upon isolation/retransformation. Plasmid cross-hybridizations and sequencing of representative members of each class resulted in the identification of three C2H2 zinc finger classes. Construction of Full-length cDNA Clones—To construct full-length clones, 5′ sequences were isolated by PCR with a gene-specific primer and the vector primer 5′-CCCCACCAAACCCAAAAAAAG-3′ using the pACTII cDNA library as a template. ZCT1 appeared to be a full-length clone. To confirm this notion, 5′ sequences amplified with the gene-specific primer 5′-CTAAAGATTGATGGAGTAGATC-3′ were digested with BamHI/HindIII and cloned in pBluescript SK+. Sequencing of the longest PCR fragment yielded additional sequence information of 10 nucleotides. ZCT2 5′ sequences amplified with the gene-specific primer 5′-CATCAACAATATTCGACTTCTTCACC-3′ were digested with BamHI/NdeI and cloned in pUC28. The insert from the pACTII-ZCT2 clone was excised with BamHI/XhoI and first cloned into the vector pIC-19R (18Marsh J.L. Erfle M. Wykes E.J. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) digested with BglII/SalI, after which it was transferred as a NdeI/SmaI fragment to the pUC28 plasmid containing the PCR fragment digested with NdeI/EcoRV, resulting in a full-length ZCT2FL cDNA. ZCT3 5′ sequences amplified with the gene-specific primer 5′-CTAAAGATTGATGGAGTA-3′ were digested with BamHI/SacI and cloned in pBluescript SK+. The insert from the pACTII-ZCT3 clone was excised with EcoRI/EcoRV, and first cloned into the vector pIC-19H after which it was transferred as a SacI fragment to the pBluescript SK+ plasmid containing the PCR fragment, resulting in a full-length ZCT3FL cDNA. Construction of Escherichia coli Expression Plasmids—The ZCT1 insert was excised from the pACTII vector with SmaI/XhoI and inserted in pIC-19R digested with EcoRV/SalI. The resulting plasmid was used as template with primers 5′-CGGGATCCTCGAGATGGGCGTGAA-GAGATTCAGAG-3′ and M13–40 in a PCR, and the product was digested with BamHI and cloned in pACTII. From there it was excised with XhoI and introduced in pGEX-KG (19Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The ZCT2FL insert was amplified with the primers 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGATGGTGATGATTA-ATATA-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGT15-3′, and after digestion with BamHI/HindIII, was introduced in pGEX-KG. The ZCT3FL insert was amplified with the primers 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGATGGCACTT-GAAGCTTTG-3′ and T3, and following digestion with BamHI/XhoI introduced in pGEX-KG. Expression plasmids were introduced in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS, and proteins isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions were dialyzed against electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) binding buffer. EMSAs—STR promoter fragments, RV wild-type and mutant fragments (10Menke F.L.H. Champion A. Kijne J.W. Memelink J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and TDC promoter fragments (20Ouwerkerk P.B.F. Trimborn T.O. Hilliou F. Memelink J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 610-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were isolated and labeled as described. DNA-binding reactions contained 0.1 ng of end-labeled DNA probe, 500 ng of poly(dA-dT)-poly(dA-dT), binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol), and protein extract in a 10-μl volume. For analysis of the requirement of zinc for binding, ZCT proteins were pre-incubated for 5 min in binding buffer containing 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma)/1% ethanol or 1% ethanol before addition of probe DNA. Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before loading on 5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (37:1)-0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA gels under tension. After electrophoresis at 125 V for 1 h, gels were dried on Whatman DE81 paper and autoradiographed. Construction of Plant Expression Vectors—The ZCT1 insert was excised from pACTII with SmaI/XhoI, cloned in pIC-19R digested with EcoRV/SalI, and then cloned in pMOG463 as a BamHI fragment. The ZCT2 insert was excised from pUC28-ZCT2FL with BamHI and cloned in pMOG183. The pMOG vectors are pUC18 derivatives carrying a double-enhanced CaMV 35 S promoter and the nos terminator separated by a BamHI site. The full-length ZCT3FL cDNA was cloned as a BamHI/BglII fragment in SK+-35 S-nos. This pBluescript derivative carries a double-enhanced CaMV 35 S promoter and the nos terminator separated by a BamHI site. Cell Cultures—C. roseus cell suspension line MP183L was grown as described (6Pasquali G. Goddijn O.J.M. de Waal A. Verpoorte R. Schilperoort R.A. Hoge J.H.C. Memelink J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Transient Expression Assays—Cells of C. roseus cell line MP183L were co-transformed with plasmids carrying different promoter parts fused to GUSA and overexpression vectors carrying ZCT1, ZCT2, ZCT3, and/or ORCA2 or ORCA3 cDNAs fused to the CaMV 35 S promoter. Co-transformations of the promoter-GUS constructs with an empty overexpression vector (pMOG184) served as controls. Cells were transformed with a total of 10 μg of plasmid DNA through particle bombardment as described before (21van der Fits L. Memelink J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 943-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), using the two constructs in a ratio of 1:4 (GUS:ZCT/ORCA). In the case of co-bombardment with both ORCA and zinc finger cDNAs, the ratio was 1:4:4 (GUS:ZCT:ORCA). Each plasmid combination was bombarded in triplicate, where each replicate consisted of an independent DNA coating of tungsten particles. Twenty-four hours after transformation, cells were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. β-Glucuronidase (GUS) activity assays were performed as described (21van der Fits L. Memelink J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 943-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GUS reporter activity was related to total protein amounts to correct for the amount of cells used in each transformation. GUS activity was depicted as relative activity compared with the vector control. Statistical analysis of the results was done using the nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Elicitor and Jasmonate Treatment—Partially purified elicitor was prepared from yeast extract (YE) (Difco), through ultrafiltration and a number of chromatographic steps, as described in Ref. 8Menke F.L.H. Parchmann S. Mueller M.J. Kijne J.W. Memelink J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar. The amount of purified elicitor used for induction experiments was calibrated to correspond to a final concentration of 400 μg/ml of crude YE using a semi-quantitative alkalinization response assay as described before (8Menke F.L.H. Parchmann S. Mueller M.J. Kijne J.W. Memelink J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Methyljasmonate (Bedoukian Research Inc.) was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis were performed as described before (8Menke F.L.H. Parchmann S. Mueller M.J. Kijne J.W. Memelink J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), loading 20-μg RNA samples onto the gels. All Northern blots were probed using 32P-labeled cDNA fragments. ORCA2, ORCA3, RPS9, and STR probes were described before (8Menke F.L.H. Parchmann S. Mueller M.J. Kijne J.W. Memelink J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Isolation of Zinc Finger Proteins ZCT1, ZCT2, and ZCT3—To identify DNA-binding proteins that interact with the YE-responsive DB element of the TDC promoter, a yeast one-hybrid screening was performed with this element. A derivative of yeast strain Y187, containing a tetramer of DB fused to the HIS3 selection marker, was used in a screen to isolate DNA-binding proteins from a cDNA library of C. roseus cloned in a fusion with the GAL4 activation domain in yeast expression vector pACTII. In total, 2.4 million Y187–4DB transformants were screened for reporter gene activation. A total of 188 cDNA clones, belonging to several classes, were isolated from yeast colonies that showed growth on medium lacking histidine. No cDNAs encoding ORCA or CrBPF1 proteins were recovered, which is consistent with the fact that these proteins do not bind DB in vitro. In addition, no clones encoding CrGBFs were found, despite the fact that CrGBFs have a weak affinity for a G-box-like sequence in the DB element in vitro (13Sibéril Y. Benhamron S. Memelink J. Giglioli-Guivarc'h N. Thiersault M. Boisson B. Doireau P. Gantet P. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Comparison of the DNA sequences to sequences in the NCBI data base revealed that three cDNA classes encoded proteins with two Cys2/His2-type (TFIIIA-type) zinc fingers. In a TFIIIA-type zinc finger protein, two cysteines and two histidines, in a conserved sequence motif (CX2–4CX3FX5LX2HX3–5H), tetrahedrally coordinate a zinc atom to form a compact structure that interacts with the major groove of DNA in a sequence-specific manner (22Pavletich N. Pabo C. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar, 23Choo Y. Klug A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). All three Catharanthus classes possess the typical characteristics of plant TFIIIA-type two-fingered proteins (24Takatsuji H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Both fingers have the QALGGH sequence in the putative DNA-contacting surfaces, and the two fingers are separated by a long spacer (Fig. 1). We called the three encoded proteins ZCT1, ZCT2, and ZCT3, for zinc finger Catharanthus transcription factor. The ZCT3 class was isolated 14 times, the ZCT1 class 8 times, and ZCT2 was a single clone. The longest clone from the ZCT1 class was full-length, whereas all ZCT2 and ZCT3 clones appeared to be partial. The missing portions of ZCT2 and ZCT3 were isolated via PCR and fused to the partial cDNAs, to construct complete clones. An alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of ZCT1, ZCT2, and ZCT3 is shown in Fig. 1. The ZCT1, ZCT2, and ZCT3 proteins have predicted molecular masses of 19.6, 21, and 27.4 kDa, respectively. Comparison of the deduced ZCT1 and ZCT2 amino acid sequences to sequences in the NCBI data base showed highest homology to ZPT2-5, ZPT2-14, ZPT2-12, and ZPT2-13 from Petunia hybrida. One of the closest homologues of ZCT3 is the SCOF-1 protein from soybean, which is involved in cold tolerance (25Kim J.C. Lee S.H. Cheong Y.H. Yoo C.M. Lee S.I. Chun H.J. Yun D.J. Hong J.C. Lee S.Y. Lim C.O. Cho M.J. Plant J. 2001; 25: 247-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the two zinc fingers, the ZCT proteins contain several conserved regions. Near their N termini, they contain a short basic region (B-box; Ref. 26Sakamoto H. Araki T. Meshi T. Iwabuchi M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which may function as a nuclear localization signal (Fig. 1). Between the B-box and the first zinc finger, the ZCT proteins contain a short region of hydrophobic residues rich in leucines (L-box). The motif has been found in several other Cys2/His2 zinc finger proteins, and has been suggested to play a role in protein-protein interactions or in maintaining the folded structure of the proteins (26Sakamoto H. Araki T. Meshi T. Iwabuchi M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 27Meissner R. Michael A.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In their C-terminal region, the ZCT proteins have an LxLxL motif (Fig. 1), which is a potent repression domain found in most TFIIIA-type zinc finger, several AP2/ERF (28Ohta M. Matsui K. Hiratsu K. Shinshi H. Ohme-Takagi M. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), and in all Arabidopsis AUX/IAA (29Tiwari S.B. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) transcriptional repressors. In AP2/ERF proteins this motif has also been called the ERF-associated amphiphilic repression domain (28Ohta M. Matsui K. Hiratsu K. Shinshi H. Ohme-Takagi M. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The ZCT Proteins Bind to Several Regions of the TDC and STR Promoters—The ability of the ZCT proteins to activate HIS3 gene expression via the DB region in yeast and the presence of two zinc finger DNA-binding domains, indicated that they are DNA-binding proteins. To directly test the DNA binding of the zinc finger proteins, recombinant GST-ZCT fusion proteins were isolated from E. coli and EMSAs were performed. Incubation of the ZCT proteins with labeled DB fragment from the TDC promoter showed that they can bind to this fragment (Fig. 2C). ZCT1 and ZCT2 showed a similar binding pattern consisting of two bands, whereas ZCT3 formed a single shifted band. To test whether the ZCT proteins can also bind to other parts of the TDC promoter, EMSAs were performed with probes covering a 535-bp region of the TDC promoter upstream of the TATA box (Fig. 2A). ZCT1 and ZCT2 bound with highest affinity to the HS and DB regions of the TDC promoter, with little binding to the other fragments tested (Fig. 2D). However, ZCT3 bound to all fragments of the TDC promoter with highest affinity for HS and DB (Fig. 2D). Recombinant GST did not bind to any of the fragments used in EMSAs (data not shown). Because the TDC and STR genes are coordinately regulated by YE and MeJA, the binding of the ZCT proteins to the STR promoter was also determined. Transformation of the zinc finger clones in pACTII to a yeast strain carrying a tetramer of the RV region of the STR promoter fused to the HIS3 selection gene (10Menke F.L.H. Champion A. Kijne J.W. Memelink J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) indicated that the ZCT proteins were also able to bind to the elicitor- and jasmonate-responsive RV region of the STR promoter in vivo (results not shown). Incubation of the ZCT proteins with probes covering a 583-bp region of the STR promoter in vitro (Fig. 2B) showed that they indeed bound to the RV region and additionally to the BA and VH regions (Fig. 2D). ZCT3 bound additionally to the XD and DB fragments of the STR promoter (Fig. 2D). The RV region of the STR promoter contains the binding site for the ORCA transcriptional activators. In a previous study, a mutation scanning of the RV fragment, which comprised changing blocks of six adjacent nucleotides into their complementary nucleotides (Fig. 2B; Ref. 10Menke F.L.H. Champion A. Kijne J.W. Memelink J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), demonstrated that the ORCA binding site is located in the M2-M3-M4 region. To determine the specific binding site of the ZCT proteins in the RV fragment, the different RV mutant fragments were used as probes in EMSAs. Because the ZCT proteins showed little or no binding to mutated RV fragment M2, but did bind to the other mutated RV fragments, it can be concluded that the main binding determinant for the ZCT proteins is located in the M2 region (Fig. 2E). The ZCT binding site is therefore distinct from but overlapping with the binding site for the ORCA proteins. To determine whether the interaction of the ZCT proteins with DNA requires the binding of a zinc atom to their zinc fingers, the DNA binding affinity of the ZCT proteins was analyzed in the presence of the zinc-chelating agents EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline. Fig. 3 shows that under standard experimental conditions the ZCT proteins can bind to the RV fragment. However, the presence of EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline inhibits the binding of the ZCT proteins to the RV fragment, indicating that zinc is required for binding (Fig. 3). The presence of EGTA, which has a chemical structure similar to EDTA but specifically binds calcium, or the solvent ethanol did not influence the binding of the ZCT proteins to RV (Fig. 3) indicating the specificity of the inhibition by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline. A similar experiment using the DB fragment of the TDC promoter showed that zinc is also essential for the binding of the ZCT proteins to this fragment (results not shown). The ZCT Proteins Act as Transcriptional Repressors of STR and TDC Promoter Activity—Binding of the zinc finger proteins to both the TDC and STR promoters suggested that these proteins might be involved in the coordinated regulation of the expression of these genes. To test whether the ZCT proteins can regulate these promoters in vivo, C. roseus cells were co-transformed with a TDC-promoter-GUSA construct and an overexpression vector carrying a ZCT cDNA fused to the CaMV 35 S promoter. Co-expression of any of the ZCT proteins reduced TDC promoter activity ∼2-fold compared with the vector control (Fig. 4A). Co-expression of any of the ZCT proteins reduced STR promoter activity at least 5-fold (Fig. 4A). These results show that the ZCT proteins can act as transcriptional repressors of both the TDC and STR promoters. The repressor activity of the ZCT proteins is consistent with the presence of the LxLxL motif within these proteins. We focused our in vivo trans-regulatory studies on the STR promoter, because its structure with regard to cis-acting elements and their interaction with trans-acting factors has been elucidated in more detail than for the TDC promoter (30Gantet P. Memelink J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 563-56931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As shown above, the ZCT proteins can bind to the BA and RV regions of the STR promoter in vitro. To test whether the in vitro binding affinities are reflected in in vivo repressor activities, Catharanthus cells were co-transformed with GUS reporter plasmids carrying tetramers of the BA or RV fragments fused to the minimal CaMV 35 S promoter (–47 to +27), and an overexpression vector carrying a ZCT cDNA fused to the CaMV 35 S promoter. All three ZCT proteins could repress the activity of both the RV and BA promoter fragments (Fig. 4B). A repressor protein can inhibit transcription via different mechanisms, requiring promoter binding (e.g. competition with activators for DNA binding sites or recruitment of chromatin-modifying or remodeling complexes) or not requiring promoter binding (e.g. sequestration of basal transcription factors or activators). To determine whether the repression by the ZCT proteins occurs via a direct interaction with the DNA, co-bombardment experiments were performed using the different RV mutants fused to a minimal promoter-GUS gene. The RV mutants affected in the ORCA binding site have reduced basal transcriptional activity (11van der Fits L. Memelink J. Plant J. 2001; 25: 43-53Crossref PubMe"
https://openalex.org/W2002554762,"The key protein in Alzheimer's disease, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is a ubiquitously expressed copper-binding glycoprotein that gives rise to the Aβ amyloid peptide. Whereas overexpression of APP results in significantly reduced brain copper levels in three different lines of transgenic mice, knock-out animals revealed increased copper levels. A provoked rise in peripheral levels of copper reduced concentrations of soluble amyloid peptides and resulted in fewer pathogenic Aβ plaques. Contradictory evidence has been provided by the efficacy of copper chelation treatment with the drug clioquinol. Using a yeast model system, we show that adding clioquinol to the yeast culture medium drastically increased the intracellular copper concentration but there was no significant effect observed on zinc levels. This finding suggests that clioquinol can act therapeutically by changing the distribution of copper or facilitating copper uptake rather than by decreasing copper levels. The overexpression of the human APP or APLP2 extracellular domains but not the extracellular domain of APLP1 decreased intracellular copper levels. The expression of a mutant APP deficient for copper binding increased intracellular copper levels several-fold. These data uncover a novel biological function for APP and APLP2 in copper efflux and provide a new conceptual framework for the formerly diverging theories of copper supplementation and chelation in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Possibly, CQ might have redistributed copper from plaques to the cells, or alternatively, facilitated the uptake of CQ-copper complexes in the brain because CQ is hydrophobic and crosses the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). In a Phase II clinical trial, CQ inhibited cognitive decline and decreased plasma Aβ42 levels in moderate to severe AD patients (15Ritchie C.W. Bush A.I. Mackinnon A. Macfarlane S. Mastwyk M.

Taken together, these findings jointly argue that APP and its paralogs may play a critical role in intracellular copper homeostasis and we anticipate that (1Selkoe D.J. Schenk D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 545-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) APP or APLP2 expression is a substantial driving force for copper efflux and (2Simons A. Ruppert T. Schmidt C. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Reed J. Masters C.L. White A.R. Cappai R. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. Multhaup G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9310-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) CQ treatment enables copper passage into the cell. To test these hypotheses, the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris was used to examine the effect of expression and secretion of the N-terminal domains of human APP (sAPP), APLP1 (sAPLP1), or APLP2 (sAPLP2) on intracellular concentrations of copper in yeast cells and the influence of CQ on the APP-expressing cells (16Henry A. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cappai R. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our studies showed that clioquinol in yeast culture medium drastically increased the intracellular copper concentration in wild-type and APP-expressing cells. These results indicated that the reported protective effects of CQ are not considered solely a chelator of zinc and/or copper. In addition, we reported that APP and APLPL2 but not APLP1 are involved in copper homeostasis as copper efflux proteins. Expression Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The APP18–350 (sAPP) construct in pPIZαA (Invitrogen) was generated by PCR using the EcoRI and NotI sites in a 5′-overhang region of the forward primer (APP18–350fwd, 5′-GC GGG GCC GAA TTC CTG GAG GTA CCC ACT GAT GGT AAT G-3′) and the reverse primer (APP18–350rev, 5′-TTC ATC TAA GCG GCC GCT TAG AGT AAA CTT TGG GAC ATG GCG CTG CCA CAC AC-3′), respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of APP18–350 mutant was performed with PCR using a mismatch forward primer (APP18–350AAAfwd, 5′-AGG AGA GGA TGG ATG TTT GCG AAA CTG CTC TTG CCT GGG CCA CCG TCG CCA AAG AGA C-3′) and the APP18–350rev primer. The generated “megaprimer” was used with the APP18–350fwd primer on the same template. The amplified sequences were cloned into the pPICZαA vector at EcoRI and NotI sites in-frame to the α-secretory factor. The vectors were linearized with PmeI before transformation of P. pastoris strain SMD1168 by electroporation. Successfully transformed cells showed the methanol utilization phenotype Mut+. Recombinant secreted APLP2 (sAPLP2) and APLP1 (sAPLP1) were produced in P. pastoris by using the vector pPIC9 (Invitrogen) as has been described elsewhere (17White A.R. Zheng H. Galatis D. Maher F. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Cappai R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6207-6217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression in P. pastoris—Selection of Zeocin-resistant clones was done on YPDS plates (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 1 m sorbitol, 2% (w/v) agarose, 100 μg/ml Zeocin). 6–10 clones were selected for a test expression. Single colonies were used to inoculate BMGY medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v peptone), 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.00004% (w/v) biotin, 1% (w/v) glycerol) and were grown to an A600 of 2–6. For induction, cells were harvested (1500 × g, 15 °C, 10 min) and resuspended to an A600 of 1 in BMMY medium (BMGY with 2% (v/v) methanol instead of glycerol to induce heterologous expression) and grown for 120 h. Aliquots of different time points were taken to determine the optimum post-induction growth rate for harvesting and to analyze expression levels by Western blot. Cells grown in YPD (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose) were resuspended in YPD containing 15% glycerol to an A600 of 50–100 and were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Western Blotting—Culture supernatant and cell pellets were analyzed for protein expression. Preparation of cell pellets was performed by adding 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA) and the equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (0.5 mm, Sigma) followed by eight cycles of vortexing for 30 s and alternating cooling for 30 s on ice. After centrifugation, the cell lysate and the supernatant of the culture were mixed with SDS-PAGE gel-loading buffer (4% (w/v) SDS, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 0.04% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 20% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, 250 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8), boiled for 7 min, and loaded on a 12% SDS gel (ANAMED). After electrophoresis proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) by tank blotting (380 mA, 4 °C for 3 h), nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% (w/v) milk powder, incubated with the first antibody (22C11 1:10,000 in 1× phosphate-buffered saline), and incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase, Promega). The detection of immunoreactivity was performed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblots were quantified by measuring the relative optical densities and areas of the corresponding bands using a computerized image analysis system (AlphaEase FCSoftware, version 3.2.1., Alpha Innotech Corporation). Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)—Cells grown for 48 h in 75 ml of induction medium (BMMY) supplemented with 0, 1, or 5 mm Cu(II)Cl2, Mn(II)Cl2, or Zn(II)Cl2, respectively, were harvested, and the cell density was determined. Pellets of 15-ml yeast culture were repeatedly washed in 1× in H2O, 1× in 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, 1× in H2O, 1× in polyethylene glycol, and 1× in H2O. Cell pellets were incubated for 10 min at room temperature during the washing steps with EDTA and polyethylene glycol. For an analysis of metal concentrations, samples were prepared by HNO3 closed-vessel microwave digestion and diluted in Milli Q water to a final concentration of 6.5% HNO3 for analysis by ICP-MS. ICP-MS was performed by using a HP4500 Series 300 ShieldTorch system instrument (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) in peak-hopping mode with spacing at 0.05 atomic mass units, three points/peak, three scans/replicate, and an integration time of 300 ms/point as described previously (2Simons A. Ruppert T. Schmidt C. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Reed J. Masters C.L. White A.R. Cappai R. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. Multhaup G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9310-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The rate of plasma flow was 15 liters/min with an auxiliary flow of 0.9 liters/min and a blend gas flow rate of 0.1 liters/min. The radio frequency power was 1.2 kilowatts. The sample was introduced by using a cross-flow nebulizer at a flow rate of 1.02 liters/min. The apparatus was calibrated by using a 6.5% HNO3 solution containing copper and zinc at 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 parts/billion with Rh-103 as the internal standard for all of the isotopes of copper and zinc. The data obtained were normalized by the amount of yeast cells to compare the determined intracellular amount of metal ion per cell. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Student's t test. Error bars are shown as the mean ± S.E. SOD1 Assay—The assay for SOD activity was purchased from Calbiochem and is based on the SOD-mediated increase in the rate of autoxidation of 5,6,6a,11b-tetrahydro-3,9,10-trihydroxybenzo[c]fluorene in aqueous alkaline solution, which generates a chromophore with a wavelength of maximal absorbance at 525 nm. Cell pellets were washed 1× in H2O, 1× in 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and washed 1× in H2O, and cell lysates were prepared as described above, with the exception that a EDTA-free lysis buffer was used. Lysates were diluted 1:1 in H2O, and the measurements were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris was used to examine the influence of sAPP, sAPLP2, and sAPLP1 expression on intracellular concentrations of copper. Yeast is an appropriate system, because most of what we know regarding copper transport in eukaryotes is derived from yeast studies (18Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Annu. Rev.

There is a conservation of the copper-handling pathways in yeast and mammalian cells, e.g. proteins involved in copper utilization in yeast have counterparts in mammals, and these counterparts can substitute functionally for yeast proteins. Moreover, the yeast genome does not encode a structural homolog of APP or APLPs, making it an attractive model system for analyzing the role of APP and APLPs in copper homeostasis. We have derived P. pastoris lines that secrete the ectodomains of APLP1 (sAPLP1), APLP2 (sAPLP2), and C-terminally truncated APP (sAPP) with amino acid residues 18–350. The APP18–350 construct contains the CuBD together with the N-terminal growth factor-like domain but lacks the C-terminal half, which includes the central APP domain (residues 365–570) (21Wang Y.

There was a slight but not significant increase in zinc levels between sAPP-expressing cells and control cells (Fig. 1, b and d). When the cells were grown in the presence of 1 mm copper, the concentration of copper atoms in the sAPP-expressing cells were significantly lower (Fig. 1c) (2Simons A. Ruppert T. Schmidt C. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Reed J. Masters C.L. White A.R. Cappai R. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. Multhaup G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9310-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 5Bayer T.A.

To demonstrate the specificity of this effect, sAPLP2- and sAPLP1-secreting cells were analyzed. When compared with the mock control (Fig. 1a), the expression of sAPLP2 decreased the intracellular level of copper by 60% (Fig. 1e), whereas no changes were observed for the sAPLP1-expressing cells (Fig. 1f). Therefore, only sAPP and sAPLP2 have copper efflux activities. sAPLP1 might be unable to exert copper efflux activities, because it preferentially binds Cu(II) compared with intracellular Cu(I) (2Simons A. Ruppert T. Schmidt C. Schlicksupp A. Pipkorn R. Reed J. Masters C.L. White A.R. Cappai R. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. Multhaup G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9310-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). sAPLP1 lacks the His-X-His motif and has an “inert phenotype” that is neither toxic nor protective toward copper-mediated toxicity (3White A.R.

To establish that the CuBD of sAPP is responsible for this phenotype, we mutated the copper-binding residues H147A, H149A, and H151A (24Hesse L. Beher D. Masters C.L. Multhaup G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 25Multhaup G. Schlicksupp A. Hesse L. Beher D. Ruppert T. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K.

P. pastoris cells overexpressing sAPPH147A/H149A/H151A repeatedly demonstrated that neither copper supplementation nor the presence of clioquinol significantly changed the expression levels of wild-type or mutant sAPP as shown by the integrated density values measured (Fig. 2, a and b). Surprisingly, under standard conditions, the copper levels of the sAPPH147A/H149A/H151A cells showed a 5-fold increase compared with control cells. In the presence of 1 mm copper, intracellular copper levels are increased 16-fold because of the expression of the mutant construct (Fig. 3, a and b). These results indicate that the CuBD of sAPP is responsible for the copper efflux activity of APP. Elevating the copper concentrations in the growth medium enhanced the cytoplasmic copper concentrations in the sAPPH147A/H149A/H151A cells and partially enhanced the secretion of sAPP (Fig. 2b) as revealed by an integrated density value determined by densitometry. This finding suggests that the expression of sAPPH147/H149A/H151A may interfere with copper acquisition, sorting, or distribution systems in yeast cells (27Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A.

Sci. 2000; 173: 40-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine whether the reduced copper level in sAPP-, sAPLP1-, or sAPLP2-expressing cells lowers the bioavailability of copper, we measured the activity of cellular ySOD1 in yeast cells grown either in normal or in copper-supplemented medium by using a quantitative SOD assay (30Wong P.C. Waggoner D. Subramaniam J.R. Tessarollo L. Bartnikas T.B. Culotta V.C. Price D.L. Rothstein J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). There was a 38% decrease of ySOD1 activity in sAPP-expressing cells (Fig. 4a) and a 21% decrease of ySOD1 activity in sAPLP2-expressing cells (Fig. 4 b) that were not observed for sAPLP1 (Fig. 4c) compared with mock-transfected cells. The overexpression of mutant sAPPH147/H149A/H151A resulted in a 5-fold increase in ySOD1 (31Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) activity that correlated with the altered intracellular copper levels (Fig. 4d). Thus, the expression of sAPP or sAPLP2 limited the intracellular copper availability for apo-ySOD1 but not sAPLP1, whereas mutant sAPP H147A/H149A/H151A inhibited copper efflux and increased the intracellular accessible pool of copper to apo-ySOD1. To test the hypothesis that CQ can facilitate the uptake of copper through the formation of a CQ-copper complex, cells were treated either alone with CQ or with equimolar additions of CQ and vitamin B12 in the medium. There was a significant attenuation of cell growth either in the presence of CQ or CQ and vitamin B12. The cytotoxic effects of CQ could be blocked by adding an equimolar amount of copper or cobalt. This could not be achieved with other divalent metal ions tested, such as Mn(II) or Zn(II) (data not shown). Accordingly, unconjugated CQ was responsible for the growth inhibitory effect, which could be not reversed by inclusion of the cobalt-vitamin B12 complexes. In the 1970s, it was proposed that CQ leads to subacute myelo-optic neuropathy and that subacute myelooptic neuropathy was caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency due to a chelation of Co(II) from vitamin B12 by CQ (29Yassin M.S. Ekblom J. Xilinas M. Gottfries C.G. Oreland L. J. Neurol. Sci. 2000; 173: 40-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). There was facilitated uptake of copper into yeast cells grown in medium supplemented with 1 mm CQ plus 1 mm copper. A 35-fold increase of intracellular copper levels was found in mock control cells (Fig. 5a) treated with CQ-copper compared with cells treated with copper alone. In the presence of 1 mm vitamin B12, 1 mm CQ, and 1 mm copper, the elevation of intracellular copper was further increased to 60-fold (Fig. 5a). This effect was specific for copper levels, because the copper-CQ treatment did not change zinc levels (Fig. 5b). In the absence of CQ, neither combination of the compounds tested had a strong effect on intracellular copper concentrations (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, medium supplementation with vitamin B12 induced a significant increase of zinc levels in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5d), an effect that was reverted by the expression of sAPP, indicating that sAPP is involved in the adjustment of the cellular zinc level. This finding suggests that the homeostatic defect caused by CQ was rather due to a facilitated uptake of copper than to a redistribution as suggested for the elevated copper and zinc levels in CQ-treated APP2576 mice (14Cherny R.A. Atwood C.S. Xilinas M.E. Gray D.N. Jones W.D. McLean C.A. Barnham K.J. Volitakis I. Fraser F.W. Kim Y. Huang X. Goldstein L.E. Moir R.D. Lim J.T. Beyreuther K. Zheng H. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Neuron. 2001; 30: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The role of CQ in copper uptake was further evaluated in yeast strains expressing sAPP. If sAPP expression could substantially contribute to the transport of intracellular copper out of the cell, APP secretion should attenuate the effect of CQ on the intracellular copper concentration. Indeed, the intracellular copper in sAPP-expressing cells was limited to a 25-fold increase compared with a 35-fold increase in vector-transfected cells in the presence of 1 mm CQ-copper (Fig. 5a). With additional vitamin B12 in the medium, a drastic increase of 50-fold in sAPP-expressing cells and of 60-fold in vector-transfected cells was observed (Fig. 5a). This attenuated an increase of copper levels in sAPP-expressing cells confirmed the previously observed efflux activities, which arose from sAPP expression itself rather than from adventitious reactions. The in vitro results indicate that sAPP or sAPLP2 secretion can promote copper efflux. The inability of the copper-binding mutant sAPP H147A/H149A/H151A to promote copper efflux indicates that the copper export requires the direct binding of copper to the CuBD of sAPP. The elevation of copper from submicromolar concentrations to 1 mm in the medium raised ySOD1 activity in control cells 2-fold, and the total number of copper atoms per cell increased by 20-fold. Whereas ySOD activity was impaired by sAPP and sAPLP2 but not by APLP1 expression or copper depletion, the expression of the sAPP H147A/H149A/H151A mutant increased ySOD activity and the total number of copper atoms per cell. In the presence of 1 mm copper, the intracellular copper level further increased by 65-fold, although the ySOD1 activity was only slightly increased (Figs. 1 and 4). Because the low availability of copper within the cell is a key limitation to ySOD1 activity (31Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), copper must have been readily accessible to apo-ySOD1 in mutant sAPP H147A/H149A/H151A-secreting cells under normal growth conditions but not in control cells.

The results presented here provide a potential answer to this conundrum and support a direct role for secreted APP in cellular efflux of copper. Based on the structural homology to copper chaperones that also possess surface Cu(I) sites, the APP CuBD may function as a neuronal metallotransporter and/or metallochaperone (26Barnham K.J. McKinstry W.J. Multhaup G. Galatis D. Morton C.J. Curtain C.C. Williamson N.W. White A.R. Hinds M.G. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Parker M.W. Cappai R. J. Biol.

The structure of this domain and the nature and orientation of His-147 and His-151, which are involved in copper coordination, define a novel copper-binding site, which is surface-exposed (26Barnham K.J.

The release of the APP ectodomain from the membrane would allow this secreted form to excrete copper directly or via a copper transporter in P. pastoris. The latter option would explain the effect of mutant sAPP H147A/H149A/H151A, which could still interact with the transporter but blocks it in a dominant fashion and thus increases cellular copper levels. The possibility that the reduction of intracellular copper is merely an indirect consequence of a chelator effect by sAPP or sAPLP2 in the medium is unlikely, because experiments were done with a molar excess of 100–1000-fold of copper. The data obtained with sAPP and a C-terminally truncated sAPLP2 indicate that copper binding to the CuBD of APP (25Multhaup G. Schlicksupp A. Hesse L. Beher D. Ruppert T. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K.

It was postulated that subacute myelo-optic neuropathy was caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency due to the chelation of Co(II) by CQ (29Yassin M.S. Ekblom J. Xilinas M. Gottfries C.G. Oreland L. J. Neurol. Sci. 2000; 173: 40-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our data support the hypothesis that CQ can cause damage to the nervous system by a direct interaction with vitamin B12 but only in the absence of the supplemented divalent metal ions copper or cobalt. Surprisingly, vitamin B12 specifically increased zinc levels in mock-transfected cells. Early observations indicated that low vitamin B12 levels and zinc deficiency are linked in the cerebrospinal fluid and that vitamin B12 transport to the cerebrospinal fluid was suggested to depend on the presence of zinc (33Van Tiggelen C.J. Peperkamp J.P. Tertoolen H.J. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1984; 141: 136-137PubMed Google Scholar, 34Loonen A.J. Schmeets M.G. Ter Braak G.I. Van Bavel L.P. Int. J. Geriatr. Psychiatry. 2003; 18: 540-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may exist in P. pastoris, thus supporting the suitability of this model to study metal ion transport by APP. Despite being a chelator, CQ did not induce a loss in metalion levels systematically but rather inhibited plaque formation and concomitantly increased soluble brain copper and zinc levels (14Cherny R.A. Atwood C.S. Xilinas M.E. Gray D.N. Jones W.D. McLean C.A. Barnham K.J. Volitakis I. Fraser F.W. Kim Y. Huang X. Goldstein L.E. Moir R.D. Lim J.T. Beyreuther K. Zheng H. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Neuron. 2001; 30: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). CQ facilitated the uptake of copper as CQ-copper complexes, similar to copper-nitrilotriacetic acid-treated mice (35Sugawara N. Sugawara C. Katakura M. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1991; 72: 97-103PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals CQ-copper complexes could form in the intestinal tract and cross the BBB to enter the brain and thus explain why soluble copper and zinc levels were increased by 15% upon CQ treatment in mice brain (14Cherny R.A. Atwood C.S. Xilinas M.E. Gray D.N. Jones W.D. McLean C.A. Barnham K.J. Volitakis I. Fraser F.W. Kim Y. Huang X. Goldstein L.E. Moir R.D. Lim J.T. Beyreuther K. Zheng H. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Neuron. 2001; 30: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Therefore, CQ-copper complexes could selectively and markedly elevate copper levels in the brain of individuals with AD and counterbalance the changes in copper levels observed in AD, most probably mediated through the APP export function. On the background that aged APP transgenic mice treated with copper lived longer than untreated mice (5Bayer T.A. Schafer S. Simons A. Kemmling A. Kamer T. Tepest R. Eckert A. Schussel K. Eikenberg O. Sturchler-Pierrat C. Abramowski D. Staufenbiel M. Multhaup G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14187-14192Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), these issues may be important in understanding the integration of copper homeostasis in AD and with other physiological processes such as aging.

Here we describe a proteomic approach for the identification of proteins involved in the Drosophila larval hemolymph clotting reaction, which is essential for both sealing wounds to avoid loss of hemolymph (hemostasis) and preventing dissemination of microbes into the hemocoel. Proteomics provides a particularly suitable means to study clotting that involves the fast interaction of cellular and humoral proteins, resulting in the precipitation of an insoluble matrix independent of and preceding changes in gene expression. This precipitation leads to a soft clot, which is hardened through the activity of cross-linking enzymes (summarized in Ref. 1Theopold U. Schmidt O. Söderhäll K. Dushay M.S. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Candidates for cross-linking enzymes include phenoloxidase and transglutaminase. The formation of the soft clot is independent of hemolymph phenoloxidase (2Scherfer C. Karlsson C. Loseva O. Bidla G. Goto A. Havemann J. Dushay M.S. Theopold U. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 625-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but the enzyme participates at later stages, leading to visible melanization of the clot (summarized in Ref. 1Theopold U. Schmidt O. Söderhäll K. Dushay M.S. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Transglutaminases mediate covalent cross-linking between primary amines (e.g. a lysine residue) and glutamine residues (20Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Clotting factor XIIIa, which is a transglutaminase, cross-links the vertebrate blood clot. Transglutaminases are also involved in clotting in non-insect arthropods (1Theopold U. Schmidt O. Söderhäll K. Dushay M.S. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 21Li D. Scherfer C. Korayem A.M. Zhao Z. Schmidt O. Theopold U. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our experimental approach in this study was to compare larval hemolymph before and after clotting by proteomics. In contrast to previous (immune) proteomic studies, we did not challenge larvae with microbial elicitors, and we removed hemocytes to focus on changes in the hemolymph after clotting. In addition to this comparison, we also identified transglutaminase substrates as a means to highlight clotting factors. Our results confirm and extend previous studies in the lepidopteran Galleria mellonella (21Li D. Scherfer C. Korayem A.M. Zhao Z. Schmidt O. Theopold U. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and Drosophila melanogaster (2Scherfer C. Karlsson C. Loseva O. Bidla G. Goto A. Havemann J. Dushay M.S. Theopold U. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 625-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that involved direct isolation of the clot and subsequent identification of its components. They provide further molecular insight into clotting and the events in hemolymph after wounding. These events are the first line of defense against intruding microbes and set the stage for subsequent immune reactions. Flies—Drosophila w1118 cultures were kept at 18 °C in a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle on standard cornmeal sucrose medium. Third instar larvae were used in this study. Pull-out Assay—To obtain a non-clotted plasma fraction (Fig. 3A), 10 animals were bled directly into anticoagulant Ringer's solution (Drosophila Ringer's solution containing 0.02 m EDTA and no CaCl2). In a first attempt to obtain clotted serum, animals were opened, left for 30 s, and then placed on an electron microscope grid (90-μm pore width), which acted as a filter to remove the clot. The flow-through fraction (serum) was collected in a capillary placed underneath the grid. Both samples were subsequently centrifuged for 10 min, first at 300 × g to remove hemocytes and then at 11,000 × g and prepared for PAGE analysis. Comparison between the samples revealed that the differences between them were not sufficiently reproducible to allow a proteomics approach. Therefore, clotting was performed as part of a pullout reaction (2Scherfer C. Karlsson C. Loseva O. Bidla G. Goto A. Havemann J. Dushay M.S. Theopold U. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 625-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) followed by centrifugation as described above. Briefly, the pull-out assay relies on the incorporation of paramagnetic beads into the clot and the subsequent removal of the clot with a magnet. Proteins in the remaining supernatant (serum) were precipitated with ice-cold chloroform:methanol and washed two times with ice-cold methanol. The pellet was dried in a vacuum centrifuge and dissolved in two-dimensional sample buffer (2-D Sample Preparation for Insoluble Proteins, catalog number 89866, Pierce). After 1 h the sample was desalted with the two-dimensional sample kit according to kit instructions. Prior to isoelectric focusing (IEF), 1The abbreviations used are: IEF, isoelectric focusing; BP, 5-biotinamide-pentylamine; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight. a rehydration solution (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the sample to a final volume of 125 μl (for 7-cm strips) and 250 μl (for 13-cm strips), as well as a trace of bromphenol blue. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The solubilized protein sample was applied onto immobilized pH gradient strips (7- or 13-cm non-linear pH 3–10; Amersham Biosciences). IEF was performed with the IPGphor isoelectric focusing system (Amersham Biosciences) at 20 °C and 50 μA per immobilized pH gradient strip as follows. 7-cm strips underwent 12 h of rehydration and IEF for 1 h at 500 V, 1 h at 1000 V, and ∼3 h at 8000 V to reach a total of 12,035 volt hours. 13-cm immobilized pH gradient strips were rehydrated for 12 h followed by IEF for 1 h at 500 V, 1 h at 1000 V, and a final step at 8000 V to reach 25,600 volt hours. Prior to SDS-PAGE, strips were equilibrated for 15 min in equilibration buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and bromphenol blue) including 1% dithiothreitol followed by 15 min of incubation in equilibration buffer containing 2.5% iodoacetamide. SDS-PAGE was carried out at 20 °C for 75 min at 30 mA (7-cm strips) or 4 h at 30 mA (13-cm strips) on a 1-mm 10% minigel (Bio-Rad) or a 1.5-mm 12% 14 × 16-cm gel (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. Proteins were detected either with silver staining (a silver staining kit from Amersham Biosciences) or Coomassie staining (Brilliant Blue G-colloidal concentrate from Sigma) according to the manufacturers' protocols. The silver staining protocol was modified to be compatible with subsequent in-gel digestion for mass spectrometry analysis (22Yan J.X. Wait R. Berkelman T. Harry R.A. Westbrook J.A. Wheeler C.H. Dunn M.J. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3666-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Image Analysis—Gels were scanned with Fujifilm Luminescent PhosphorImage Analyzer LAS 1000 plus and analyzed with the PDQuest software. Protein spots were matched automatically across three gels from Drosophila plasma and four gels from serum. Gel images were normalized so that the total density in gel image on analyzed gels was made equal and thereafter subjected to statistical analysis with a Student's t test to determine whether the observed differences were statistically significant. Each of the spots was also checked by eye to exclude uncertain spots and to examine whether abundant proteins were constitutively reduced in the serum samples (for example, some isoforms of phenoloxidase differed in all pairwise comparisons between plasma and serum; see “Results”). To identify proteins that are developmentally regulated during the stages used in this analysis, plasma samples from early and late wandering larvae distinguished by gut clearance (23Andres A.J. Thummel C.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) were compared on two-dimensional gels. Proteins that differed between the different stages were excluded from further analysis. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry and Protein Identification—Spots were cut from the gel with sterile stainless steel scalpels and digested in-gel with sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega V511A) as described in (24Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar), except that the reduction and alkylation steps were omitted because cysteines were carbamidomethylated on the equilibration step of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Coomassie-stained samples were destained in 0.025 m NH4HCO3, dehydrated in CH3CN, and centrifuged in a vacuum centrifuge to complete dryness. Peptides were extracted in 50% CH3CN and 5% CF3COOH, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and resuspended in 50% CH3CN and 0.1% CF3COOH. Silver-stained samples were prepared according to Gharahdaghi et al. (25Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, samples were destained in a 1:1 solution of 0.03 m K3Fe(CN)6 and 0.1 m Na2S2O3 and then washed once in water and once in 50% CH3CN and 0.025 m NH4HCO3 followed by dehydration with 100% CH3CN. Finally, samples were dried in a SpeedVac. Proteins were in-gel digested as described above. Peptides were extracted in 50% CH3CN and 5% CF3COOH and dried completely in a SpeedVac. If necessary, the recovered peptides were purified and concentrated on C18Ziptips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to mass spectrometry, peptides were resuspended in 70% CH3CN and 0.1% CF3COOH. Mass spectra were recorded in positive reflection mode by using an Applied Biosystems MALDI-TOF Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer equipped with delayed ion-extraction technology. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as the matrix. External calibration was performed using the Sequazyme peptide mass standard kit (Angiotensin I and ACTH, clips 1–17, 18–39, and 7–38; PerSeptive Biosystems), and autodigestion peaks of bovine trypsin were used for internal calibration. Peptide mass profiles were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science; www.matrixscience.com/) and Profound (prowl.rockefeller.edu/). Searches were performed using the NCBI data base. Search parameters for monoisotopic peptide masses included allowance for one missed enzymatic cleavage and accepted the carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues and the oxidation of methionine as modifications. The results of protein identification by Mascot were confirmed based on molecular mass/pI values, and further confirmation of protein identifications was obtained using Profound software. CG numbers of the genes and predicted protein function were obtained from FlyBase (flybase.bio.indiana.edu/). Transglutaminase Labeling of Hemolymph Proteins—Labeling of hemolymph proteins with 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine was performed essentially as described elsewhere (26Ikura K. Kita K. Fujita I. Hashimoto H. Kawabata N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, larvae were bled into a buffer containing 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01 m dithiothreitol, and 0.005 m 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (Pierce). After 10 min of incubation at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 0.05 m and centrifuged at 760 × g. The supernatant was dialyzed against 0.1 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, containing 0.15 m NaCl, centrifuged at 15000 × g, and analyzed in Western blots using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin at a concentration of 0.2 μg/ml (Sigma). Preparation of Drosophila Serum—A dense fibrous clot forms immediately when Drosophila larvae are bled. The clot can be visualized by phase-contrast microscopy or fluorescence microscopy using lectins that bind to the glycoprotein-rich clot (Fig. 1, A and B) (1Theopold U. Schmidt O. Söderhäll K. Dushay M.S. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although the reaction appears quite extensive, comparison of hemolymph before (plasma) and after clotting (serum) showed only a partial depletion of clot proteins, making a systematic proteomics comparison difficult (see “Experimental Procedures”). To allow more extensive clot formation and to quantitatively deplete clotting factors, we decided to use a method we had established previously for isolation of clot components (2Scherfer C. Karlsson C. Loseva O. Bidla G. Goto A. Havemann J. Dushay M.S. Theopold U. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 625-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This method involves the incorporation of paramagnetic beads into the clot and the subsequent magnetic removal of the clot. Clotting factors can be extracted from the beads after extensive washing (Fig. 1, lane 1). When the supernatant of the reaction was applied sequentially to new batches of beads, almost no bead aggregation was observed in the second incubation, and no aggregation at all was seen in subsequent incubations (Fig. 1C, lanes 2–4). Thus, most clotting factors are depleted during the first pull-out reaction. In accordance with this observation, few proteins bind to the beads in the second and subsequent pull-out reactions (Fig. 1C). The pull-out method can thus be used to quantitatively deplete clotting factors from plasma, providing a serum fraction that is not capable of further clotting. Comparison between Plasma and Serum—To identify proteins that differ between plasma and serum, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used. We decided to first establish a two-dimensional reference map of plasma proteins, because available maps are all derived from complete hemolymph, which includes hemocytes. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table I, our map includes previously identified Drosophila hemolymph proteins as well as many proteins that had not been identified previously. A limited set of differences was observed comparing plasma and serum (see Fig. 3). Some differences could not be reproduced between replicas of the same treatment and were discarded. To avoid artifacts, we decided to only consider protein spots that differed at least 5-fold between serum and plasma (exceptions are indicated; see below and Table II). The results are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table II. Several proteins were almost completely depleted from hemolymph after clotting. These included two isoforms of the CG15825 product, an immune-induced protein with two sets of internal repeats but no strong sequence homology to other known or predicted proteins (Fig. 3, spots a and b, and Fig. 4A). This protein had been isolated previously with the pull-out method (Fig. 2 and Ref. 2Scherfer C. Karlsson C. Loseva O. Bidla G. Goto A. Havemann J. Dushay M.S. Theopold U. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 625-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), supporting our proteomic approach. Four proteins depleted in serum were identified as different isoforms of the CG8502 product, a composite protein with a mucin-domain and a domain with similarities to cuticular proteins (Fig. 3, spots d–g, and Fig. 4B). Two splice variants of CG8502 have been identified (see FlyBase), accounting for some of the isoforms we observed. Additional variation may be due to differences in posttranslational modification, for example in the degree of glycosylation of the mucin domain. When the sequence of the CG8502 product was analyzed for mucin-type glycosylation (27Hansen J.E. Lund O. Tolstrup N. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Brunak S. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), 19 significant consensus sites for O-glycosylation were identified, all of which are clustered in the mucin domain shown in Fig. 4B. In addition to predicted proteins from both Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila, CG8502 shows sequence similarity to several known cuticular proteins from other insect orders (28Andersen S.O. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The alignment with the best score is shown in Fig. 4B. Although some cuticular proteins extend beyond the aligned region shown in Fig. 4B, none of them contains a mucin domain similar to the CG8502 product, making this a unique protein.Table IProteins identified in Drosophila plasmaSample no.Gene identityProtein nameTheoretical MrTheoretical pISequence coverageMolecular functionBiological processDa%01CG6206-PA123,2925.5418α-Mannosidase activity, hydrolysisCarbohydrate metabolism02CG14526-PA79,5785.6924Endothelin-coverting enzyme activityProteolysis, peptidolysis, signal transduction03CG14476-PB106,0646.0524α-Glucosidase activityPolysaccharide metabolism04CG6953-PAFat-spondin87,1716.3830Structural molecule activityCytoskeleton organization and biogenesis, ectoderm development05CG4725-PA86,3455.8426Endothelin-converting enzyme activityProteolysis, peptidolysis, signal transduction06CG5779-PADox-A179,4416.1446Monophenol monooxygenase activityMelanization, defense response07CG5779-PADox-A179,4416.1446Monophenol monooxygenase activityMelanization, defense response08CG5779-PADox-A179,4416.1446Monophenol monooxygenase activityMelanization, defense response09CG6186-PATransferrin 172,9646.6947Ferric ion binding, iron ion transporter activity, carrier activityIron ion homeostasisCG8193-PA1979,5206.4939Monophenol monooxygenase activityDefense response10CG8193-PA19Dox-A179,5206.4939Monophenol monooxygenase activityDefense responseCG5779-PA79,4416.1446Melanization, defense response11CG8193-PA1979,5206.4939Monophenol monooxygenase activityDefense response12CG5779-PADox-A179,4416.1446Monophenol monooxygenase activityMelanization, defense responseCG8193-PA1979,5206.4939Monophenol monooxygenase activityDefense response13CG8913-PAPeroxidase79,0866.9937Peroxidase activityDefense response, oxygen and reactive oxygen species metabolism14CG15825-PA1856,6715.972515CG15825-PA1856,6715.972516CG15825-PB1858,1126.452717CG5210-PA47K glycoprotein precursor50,7067.9939Chitinase-like, growth factor activity18CG1780-PAIdgf448,8027.6541Idgf activityCell-cell signaling, signal transduction19CG4559-PAIdgf349,4177.1234Idgf activity, NOT chitinase activity, hydrolase activityCell-cell signaling, signal transductionCG1780-PAIdgf448,8027.653520CG5779-PADox-A179,4416.1446Monophenol monooxygenase activityMelanization, defense response ferric ion binding, iron ion transporter activity, carrier activityCG1106-PAGelsolin, secreted form precursor98,5005.1119Actin binding, structural constituent of cytoskeletonCytoskeleton organization and biogenesis21CG11313-PA41,8818.2837Monophenol monooxygenase activator activity, trypsin activityProteolysis and peptidolysis22CG6058-PHAldolase39,8507.6067Fructose-biphosphate aldolase activityGlycolysis23CG9331-PA35,7486.2751Oxidoreductase activity24CG6058-PB19Aldolase39,2516.9759Fructose-biphosphate aldolase activityGlycolysis25CG8502-PC37,1486.3842Structural constituent of larval cuticle26CG8502-PC37,1486.3842Structural constituent of larval cuticle27CG8502-PA33,8116.3642Structural constituent of larval cuticle28CG8502-PA33,8116.3642Structural constituent of larval cuticle29CG5177-PA31,2916.6339Trehalose phosphatase activityDisaccharide metabolism30CG1803-PC18Regucalcin33,6806.0240Calcium ion bindingAnterior/posterior specification, calcium-mediated signaling31CG10467-PA1839,8886.1073Aldose-1 epimerase activityMonosaccharide metabolism32CG32031-PD18,19Arginine kinase40,1266.0461Arginine kinase activityPhosphorylation33CG5896-PA37,9917.5140Serine-type endopeptidase activity, trypsin activityProteolysis, peptidolysis34CG1780-PAIdgf448,8027.6538Idgf activityCell-cell signaling, signal transductionCG1106-PHGelsolin, secreted form precursor98,5005.1122Actin binding, structural constituent of cytoskeletonCytoskeleton organization and biogenesis35CG4475-PA18Chain A, crystal structure of Idgf247,0966.0948Idgf activity, NOT chitinase activity, hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing N-glycosyl compoundsCell-cell signaling, signal transduction36CG17654-PA18Enolase54,5898.6940Phosphopyruvate hydratase activityGlycolysis37CG5154-PAIdgf550,3616.3237Chitinase activity, hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing N-glycosyl compounds, growth factor activityCell-cell signaling, polysaccharide metabolism, signal transduction38CG8063-PA51,2257.0527Intramolecular isomerase activity"

Recently, the binding site for a non-physiological alkyne substrate (propargyl alcohol, HC≡C-CH2OH) was localized to a specific Fe-S face of the FeMo-cofactor approached by the MoFe protein amino acid α-70Val. Here we provide evidence to indicate that the smaller alkyne substrate acetylene (HC≡CH), the physiological substrate dinitrogen, and its semi-reduced form hydrazine (H2N-NH2) interact with the same Fe-S face of the FeMo-cofactor. Hydrazine is a relatively poor substrate for the wild-type (α-70Val) MoFe protein. Substitution of the α-70Val residue by an amino acid having a smaller side chain (alanine) dramatically enhanced hydrazine reduction activity. Conversely, substitution of α-70Val by an amino acid having a larger side chain (isoleucine) significantly lowered the capacity of the MoFe protein to reduce dinitrogen, hydrazine, or acetylene.

Biological reduction of dinitrogen (N2) is catalyzed by nitrogenase, a two-component metalloenzyme. The ideal reaction, summarized here by equation 1, N2+8e−+16MgATP+8H+→2NH3+H2+16MgADP+16Pi(Eq. 1) is catalyzed by nitrogenase. For the molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase, substrate reduction occurs at a complex metallo-cluster called the FeMo-cofactor, which is contained within the α-subunit of the nitrogenase component protein called the MoFe protein. The structure of the active site FeMo-cofactor was revealed in 1992 when a high resolution x-ray crystal structure of the MoFe protein was solved (Fig. 1) (1Kim J.S. Rees D.C.

Inspection of the structure suggested the following two candidate sites for substrate binding: 1) at one or more of the iron atoms that comprise the central waist region of the FeMo-cofactor; and 2) at the molybdenum atom (5Seefeldt L.C.

This residue, α-70Val, is positioned directly above a specific Fe-S face of the FeMo-cofactor comprised of iron atoms 2, 3, 6, and 7 (numbered from the x-ray structure) (Fig. 1) (2Einsle O. Tezcan F.A. Andrade S.L.A. Schmid B. Yoshida M. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 297: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Substitution of α-70 by alanine was found to allow access of larger alkyne substrates such as propyne (HC≡C-CH3) and propargyl alcohol (HC≡C-CH2OH), which otherwise are very poor substrates for the unaltered MoFe protein (15Benton P.M.

Dalton Trans. 2002; : 802-807Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that a propargyl alcohol reduction intermediate can be trapped on the FeMo-cofactor in the substituted MoFe protein (15Benton P.M. Laryukhin M. Mayer S.M. Hoffman B.M. Dean D.R. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9102-9109Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).

Here, we report the consequences of substitution of α-70Val by amino acids having smaller (alanine) or larger (isoleucine) side chains on the reduction of N2, its semi-reduced form hydrazine, and the non-physiological alkyne substrate acetylene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Protein Purification—All reagents, unless specified otherwise, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received. Hydrazine was obtained as hydrazine dihydrate. Azotobacter vinelandii strains DJ995 (wild-type α-70Val), DJ1373 (α-70Ile), and DJ1310 (α-70Ala) were grown and nitrogenase proteins were expressed as described previously (13Christiansen J.

The α-70Val (wild-type), α-70Ala, and α-70Ile MoFe proteins, each containing a seven-His addition on the α-subunit, were purified by a zinc affinity purification protocol as described earlier (20Christiansen J.

All proteins used were >95% pure as judged by analysis using SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. Manipulation of proteins was done in septum-sealed serum vials under an argon atmosphere, and all gas and liquid transfers used gas-tight syringes.Dinitrogen, Acetylene, and Proton Reduction Assays—Activity assays for dinitrogen reduction were performed in 1-ml liquid volumes in vials with 9 ml of total volume using established protocols (13Christiansen J.

Unless stated otherwise, reactions utilized 50 μg of MoFe protein, were initiated by the addition of 500 μg of Fe protein, and were quenched by the addition of 300 μl of 400 mm EDTA. Ammonia was quantified using a liquid chromatographic-fluorescence protocol (24Corbin J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 47: 1027-1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. A 30-μl aliquot of post-reaction solution containing NH3 was added to 1 ml of a detection solution containing 20 mm phthalic dicarboxyaldehyde, 3.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) ethanol, and 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, and allowed to react in the dark for 30 min. A portion of this mixture was then separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a C-18 guard column running isocratically, utilizing 50% acetonitrile in 10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.3 flowing at 1.8 ml/min. Detection was by fluorescence (λexcitation of 410 nm and λemission of 472 nm). An NH3 standard curve was generated using NH4Cl. Kinetic constants (Vmax and Km) were determined by non-linear least squares fitting of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the computer program IgorPro.Acetylene reduction to ethylene (C2H4) was determined using the assay mixture described above and the protocols for analysis described previously (25Benton P.M. Christiansen J. Dean D.R. Seefeldt L.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas proton reduction was done as for acetylene, except that they were performed under an argon atmosphere and analyzed using a molecular sieve 5A column and a thermal conductivity detector to quantify hydrogen gas (23Kim C.H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Hydrazine Reduction Assays—Rates for ammonia formation from the reduction of hydrazine were determined using the fluorescent technique described above for dinitrogen reduction with modifications to lower the interferences from the hydrazine. Assays were run for 15 min with increased concentrations of MoFe protein (200 μg/ml) in a multiple buffer system containing MOPS (75 mm) and TAPS (75 mm). Only 5 μl of the post-reaction solution containing NH3 was added to 1 ml of the detection solution. The pH of buffer solutions was adjusted following each addition of hydrazine (either to pH 7 or to pH 8). The Km values obtained for wild-type (α-70Val) agree well with those obtained previously by Davis (26Davis L.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 204: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Dinitrogen Inhibition of Hydrazine Reduction—Rates for hydrazine reduction were monitored as the loss of hydrazine with quantification by the colorimetric assay described previously (27Thorneley R.N.F. Eady R.R. Lowe D.J. Nature. 1978; 272: 557-558Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Dinitrogen inhibition of hydrazine reduction was measured for five starting concentrations of hydrazine (1, 2, 3, 4.5, and 6 mm) under increasing partial pressures of N2 (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 atm), with the remaining gas being argon. Reactions were run in a modified assay solution with a MgATP regeneration system (5 mm ATP, 30 mm phosphocreatine, 200 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, 1.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 6 mm MgCl2, and 12 mm dithionite). A total of 200 μg of MoFe protein was used, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 500 μg of Fe protein and quenched after 10 min by the addition of 300 μl of 400 mm EDTA. Hydrazine was quantified in the quenched samples by adding a portion of the quenched assay solution to 1 ml of hydrazine assay reagent (70 mm dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and 1 m HCl in ethanol). The solution was mixed and the absorbance determined at 458 nm against a reagent blank. The inverse of the initial rate was plotted against the inhibitor concentration (N2) in a Dixon plot.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDinitrogen and Alkyne Reduction Site—Previous studies indicated that propargyl alcohol can access the nitrogenase active site and be trapped there when the MoFe protein α-70Val residue is substituted by alanine. The α-70Val side chain approaches a specific Fe-S face of the FeMo-cofactor comprising iron atoms 2, 3, 6, and 7 (Fig. 1) (13Christiansen J. Cash V.L. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

It was also shown that the trapped intermediate is a semi-reduced metallocyclopropene species, most likely bound to iron atom 6 (16Igarashi R.Y. Dos Santos P.C. Niehaus W.G. Dance I.G. Dean D.R.

Questions that emerged from this analysis included whether or not other substrates such as acetylene and N2 are also reduced at this Fe-S face, and, if so, whether this is the only site that is available for the binding of these substrates. These questions are important ones, because non-reciprocity in the mutual inhibition patterns for acetylene and N2 reduction, as well as kinetic parameters for acetylene reduction, has been interpreted to indicate that there could be multiple and separate substrate binding sites and/or that substrates are able to access a variety of different redox states (28Hwang J.C. Chen C.H. Burris R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 256-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 29Dilworth M.J. Biochim. Biophys.

If N2 and alkynes access the same Fe-S face of the FeMo-cofactor composed of iron atoms 2, 3, 6, and 7, then substituting an amino acid with a larger side chain (e.g. isoleucine) for α-70Val would be predicted to interfere with the binding and/or reduction of both N2 and acetylene (Fig. 1). The wild-type MoFe protein, when combined with the Fe protein, MgATP, and an electron source (e.g. dithionite), catalyzes the reduction of N2 to 2NH3 with a specific activity of ∼600 nmol of NH3 per minute per milligram of MoFe protein and a Km for N2 reduction of 0.1 atm (Table I). Under these conditions, ∼30% of the electrons delivered to the FeMo-cofactor for the reduction of substrates (electron flux) by nitrogenase are utilized to reduce protons to H2. In the absence of N2 (under 1 atm of argon), all of the electron flux is used to reduce protons with an overall specific activity of ∼2000 nmol of H2 per minute per milligram of MoFe protein. This latter reaction provides a convenient control to monitor the catalytic integrity of nitrogenase. When valine at position α-70 is substituted by isoleucine, the resulting MoFe protein retains normal electron flux (∼2300 nmol of H2 per minute per milligram) as measured by proton reduction activity (Table I). However, the ability to reduce N2 is significantly diminished in the α-70Ile MoFe protein, with the specific activity being lowered by 72% (at 1 atm of N2) as compared with the specific activity for the wild-type MoFe protein (Table I and Fig. 2). In addition, the Km for N2 reduction was dramatically increased by >15-fold (Table I).Table IKinetic data for dinitrogen and acetylene reductionMoFe proteinArgon specific activityaWith nanomoles of H2DinitrogenAcetyleneSpecific activityaWith nanomoles of H2Specific activitybWith nanomoles of NH3KmSpecific activityaWith nanomoles of H2Specific activitycWith nanomoles of C2H4Kmnmol/min/mgnmol/min/mgnmol/min/mgatmnmol/min/mgnmol/min/mgatmα-70Val (wild-type)2020 ± 20640 ± 20600 ± 300.1200 ± 201800 ± 250.005α-70Ile2340 ± 351940 ± 50170 ± 20>1.52000 ± 60130 ± 10>0.6a With nanomoles of H2b With nanomoles of NH3c With nanomoles of C2H4 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Concentration dependence of dinitrogen reduction.

These results are consistent with the larger side chain of isoleucine preventing access to the iron 2, 3, 6, and 7 face for both N2 and acetylene interaction but not interfering with the reduction of protons or electron flux through nitrogenase. These results indicate that N2 and acetylene access the same Fe-S face (comprising iron atoms 2, 3, 6, and 7) of the FeMo-cofactor.Hydrazine Reduction Site—Hydrazine, a semi-reduced form of dinitrogen, is also a substrate for nitrogenase, being reduced by two electrons and two protons to yield 2NH3 (26Davis L.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 204: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hydrazine has been detected when a nitrogenase reaction mixture is chemically quenched during N2 reduction, which has been interpreted as evidence that a metal-bound dinitrogenhydride intermediate is likely to exist during N2 reduction (27Thorneley R.N.F. Eady R.R. Lowe D.J. Nature. 1978; 272: 557-558Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Also, hydrazine has been detected as a minor product during N2 reduction by the alternative vanadium-containing nitrogenase (31Dilworth M.J. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 32Dilworth M.J. Eldridge M.E. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).We probed the reduction of hydrazine by nitrogenase MoFe proteins having amino acid substitutions at α-70 as a way to further establish that this Fe-S face of the FeMo-cofactor is required for the reduction of nitrogenous substrates. For the wild-type MoFe protein, hydrazine is a relatively poor substrate with a Km of 26 mm at pH 8 and 125 mm at pH 7 (Table II) as compared with the Km for N2 of 0.05 atm (30 μm) at 30 °C. The reduction activity for hydrazine by the wild-type MoFe protein is lower than the reduction activity observed for N2 (Table II).Table IIKinetic data for hydrazine reductionMoFe proteinpH 7pH 8KmV maxaWith nanomoles of NH3KmV maxaWith nanomoles of NH3mmnmol/min/mgmmnmol/min/mgα-70Val (wild-type)125 ± 25500 ± 6025.8 ± 1.8425 ± 15α-70Ala14.6 ± 1.31150 ± 283.1 ± 0.2975 ± 15a With nanomoles of NH3 Open table in a new tab If the low rate of hydrazine reduction for the wild-type MoFe protein is the result of poor access to the active site and if hydrazine is reduced at the same Fe-S face of the FeMo-cofactor as the N2 and alkyne substrates, its reduction should be improved by the substitution of α-70Val by alanine and diminished by the substitution of α-70Val by isoleucine (Fig. 1). These predictions were verified experimentally. For example, substitution of α-70Val by alanine significantly improves the ability of the MoFe protein to reduce hydrazine with an approximate 2-fold increase of the Vmax and an 8-fold decrease in the Km at both pH 7 and 8 (Fig. 3 and Table II). The differences in activity for hydrazine at different pH values probably reflect the differences in affinity for the hydrazine protonated state. As expected, N2 was found to be an inhibitor of hydrazine reduction by the α-70Ala MoFe protein.Fig. 3Concentration dependence of hydrazine reduction. Hydrazine reduction activity was measured as the ammonia formed at pH 7(panel a) and pH 8 (panel b) for the wild-type α-70Val (♦ in panel a and • in panel b), the α-70Ala (⋄ in panel a and ○ in panel b), and the α-70Ile (▵) MoFe proteins. Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When α-70Val is substituted by isoleucine, hydrazine reduction activity was effectively eliminated at both pH 7 and 8 (Fig. 3). Elimination of hydrazine reduction by substitution of a single amino acid further supports the conclusion that hydrazine must access the Fe-S face located adjacent to the α-70Val for reduction.Mechanistic Implications and Conclusions—In this work we demonstrate that the size of the amino acid side chain at position α-70 in the MoFe protein, which is located directly over a specific Fe-S face of the FeMo-cofactor, controls the ability of nitrogenase to reduce N2, acetylene, and hydrazine. The substitution of isoleucine at this position blocks the reduction of acetylene, N2, and its semi-reduced form hydrazine, whereas the substitution of alanine has the opposite effect, increasing the reactivity of nitrogenase toward hydrazine and allowing the reduction of short chain alkynes larger than acetylene (18Mayer S.M. Niehaus W.G. Dean D.R. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 2002; : 802-807Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These and other results (23Kim C.H. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Fisher K. Dilworth M.J. Newton W.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15570-15577Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), support a model in which alkyne substrates, N2, and hydrazine all interact with a common Fe-S face composed of iron atoms 2, 3, 6, and 7. Although these results indicate that this Fe-S face provides the metal-sulfur surface for substrate binding, they do not exclude the possibility for multiple sites within this face, different binding configurations for different substrates, or different binding configurations at different redox states. Biological reduction of dinitrogen (N2) is catalyzed by nitrogenase, a two-component metalloenzyme. The ideal reaction, summarized here by equation 1, N2+8e−+16MgATP+8H+→2NH3+H2+16MgADP+16Pi(Eq. 1) is catalyzed by nitrogenase. For the molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase, substrate reduction occurs at a complex metallo-cluster called the FeMo-cofactor, which is contained within the α-subunit of the nitrogenase component protein called the MoFe protein. The structure of the active site FeMo-cofactor was revealed in 1992 when a high resolution x-ray crystal structure of the MoFe protein was solved (Fig. 1) (1Kim J.S. Rees D.C.

Inspection of the structure suggested the following two candidate sites for substrate binding: 1) at one or more of the iron atoms that comprise the central waist region of the FeMo-cofactor; and 2) at the molybdenum atom (5Seefeldt L.C.

To understand how the same second messenger conveys different information, mutants of the rat olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel α-subunit CNGA2, encoded into adenoviruses, were used to monitor cAMP in adult rat ventricular myocytes. CNGA2 was not found in native myocytes but was strongly expressed in infected cells. In whole cell patch-clamp experiments, the forskolin analogue L-858051 (L-85) elicited a non-selective, Mg2+-sensitive current observed only in infected cells, which was thus identified as the CNG current (ICNG). The β-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (ISO) also activated ICNG, although the maximal efficiency was ≈5 times lower than with L-85. However, ISO and L-85 exerted a similar maximal increase of the L-type Ca2+ current. The use of a CNGA2 mutant with a higher sensitivity for cAMP indicated that this difference is caused by the activation of a localized fraction of CNG channels by ISO. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) blockade with H89 or PKI, or phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition with IBMX, dramatically potentiated ISO- and L-85-stimulated ICNG. A similar potentiation of β-adrenergic stimulation occurred when PDE4 was blocked, whereas PDE3 inhibition had a smaller effect (by 2-fold). ISO and L-85 increased total PDE3 and PDE4 activities in cardiomyocytes, although this effect was insensitive to H89. However, in the presence of IBMX, H89 had no effect on ISO stimulation of ICNG. This study demonstrates that subsarcolemmal cAMP levels are dynamically regulated by a negative feedback involving PKA stimulation of subsarcolemmal cAMP-PDE.

Recent evidence indicates that multimolecular signaling complexes between cell surface receptors and intracellular targets are essential for the speed and specificity of signal transduction events (1Davare M.A. Avdonin V.

However, how such modules maintain specificity when small diffusible molecules are generated during the signaling cascade is difficult to investigate. This question is particularly relevant for cAMP in the heart, where this cyclic nucleotide second messenger exerts diverse effects in response to a number of different neuromediators and hormones.

Localized cAMP signals may be generated by the interplay between discrete production sites and restricted diffusion within the cytoplasm.

Cardiac PDEs fall into four families: PDE1, which is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin; PDE2, which is stimulated by cGMP; PDE3, which is inhibited by cGMP; and PDE4. Whereas PDE1 and PDE2 can hydrolyze both cAMP and cGMP, PDE3 preferentially hydrolyzes cAMP, and PDE4 is specific for cAMP. There is abundant biochemical evidence that PDE3 and PDE4 are activated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation in several tissues, providing a putative negative feedback mechanism by which cAMP may regulate its own levels (15Shakur Y.

A deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in cAMP homeostasis requires appropriate methods for the direct and continuous measurement of the second messenger in intact cells. The approaches developed so far in cardiac myocytes are based on the use of fluorescent PKA as a biosensor of cAMP (18Goaillard J.M. Vincent P.V. Fischmeister R. J.

However, careful evaluation of PKA-based indicators reveals a number of drawbacks, which complicate the interpretation of the results. Among these, the kinase activity inherent to the probe and the poor dynamic range may be regarded as the most limiting (18Goaillard J.M. Vincent P.V. Fischmeister R. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Rich T.C. Karpen J.W. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2002; 30: 1088-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An alternative approach, initially developed by Rich et al. (7Rich T.C. Fagan K.A. Nakata H. Schaack J. Cooper D.M. Karpen J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), uses genetically modified α-subunits of rat olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNG) as cAMP sensors. The wild-type α-subunit (CNGA2), on its own, forms a cationic channel directly opened by cyclic nucleotides with fast kinetics, wide dynamic range, and lack of desensitization. Mutants of CNGA2 with increased cAMP sensitivity and selectivity have proven to be valuable tools for monitoring subsarcolemmal cAMP in model cells (19Rich T.C. Karpen J.W. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2002; 30: 1088-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this article, we report the first real-time measurement of cAMP with CNG channels in cardiac myocytes. This method was used to directly examine some of the regulatory mechanisms involved in shaping physiological subsarcolemmal cAMP signals. Isolation, Culture, and Infection of Adult Rat Ventricular Myocytes— The investigation conforms with the European Community guiding principles in the care and use of animals (86/609/CEE, CE Off J n°L358, 18 December 1986), the local ethics committee (CREEA Ile-de-France Sud) guidelines and the French decree n°87/748 of October 19, 1987 (J Off République Française, 20 October 1987, pp. 12245–12248). Authorizations to perform animal experiments according to this decree were obtained from the French Ministère de l'Agriculture et de la Forêt (n°04226, April 12, 1991). Male Wistar rats (160–180 g) were subjected to anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of pentothal (0.1 mg/g), and hearts were excised rapidly. Individual ventricular myocytes were obtained by retrograde perfusion of the heart as previously described (20Verde I. Vandecasteele G. Lezoualc'h F. Fischmeister R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated cells were suspended in minimal essential medium (MEM: M 4780; Sigma) containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France), 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 2% HEPES (pH 7.6) and plated on laminin-coated culture dishes (10 μg/ml laminin, 2 h) at a density of 104 cells per dish. The cells were left to adhere for 1 h in a 95% O2, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C, before the medium was replaced by 200 μl of FBS-free MEM containing the E583M CNGA2-encoding adenovirus (Ad-CNG), the E583M C460W CNGA2-encoding adenovirus or the green fluorescent protein-encoding adenovirus (Ad-GFP). Ad-GFP was used at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 plaque-forming units (pfu) per cell, whereas both CNG channel-encoding adenoviruses were generally used at 3000 pfu/cell (see results). In co-infection experiments of Ad-CNG with an adenovirus encoding for rabbit muscle cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (Ad-PKI) (21Lum H. Jaffe H.A. Schulz I.T. Masood A. RayChaudhury A. Green R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C580-C588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), each virus was used at MOI 600. After 2 h, the same volume of FBS-free medium without adenovirus was added, and the cells were placed overnight in an incubator. The medium was changed the next morning for adenovirus- and FBS-free MEM. Patch-clamp experiments were performed the same day. Electrophysiological Experiments—The whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used to record the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) and the CNG current (ICNG). For ICa,L measurement, the cells were depolarized every 8 s from –50 to 0 mV during 400 ms. The use of –50 mV as holding potential allowed the inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium currents. Potassium currents were blocked by replacing all K+ ions with external and internal Cs+. For ICNG measurement, the cells were maintained at 0 mV holding potential and routinely hyperpolarized every 8 s to –50 mV test potential during 200 ms. Current-voltage relationships were obtained by varying the test potential amplitude to values ranging from –50 to +50 mV. The 0 mV holding potential was chosen because it corresponds to the reversal potential of ICNG under our experimental conditions (Fig. 2C). Indeed, ICNG was recorded in the absence of divalent cations in the extracellular solution (see below) allowing monovalent cations to flow through the channels in a nonspecific manner. All the experiments were done at room temperature (21–27 °C), and the temperature did not vary by more than 1 °C in a given experiment. Solutions and Drugs for Patch-Clamp Recording—Control zero Ca2+/Mg2+ extracellular Cs+ Ringer solution contained (in mm): NaCl 107.1, CsCl 20, NaHCO3 4, NaH2PO4 0.8, d-glucose 5, sodium pyruvate 5, HEPES 10, adjusted to pH 7.4. For ICNG recording, this solution was supplemented with nifedipine (1 μm) to block nonspecific cation current through L-type Ca2+ channels. For ICa,L recording, nifedipine was omitted and 1.8 mm CaCl2 and 1.8 mm MgCl2 were added to the external solution. Control and drug-containing solutions were applied to the exterior of the cell by placing the cell at the opening of a 250-μm inner diameter capillary tubing. Patch electrodes (0.8–1.2 MΩ) were filled with control internal solution containing (in mm): CsCl 118, EGTA 5, MgCl2 4, sodium phosphocreatine 5, Na2ATP 3.1, Na2GTP 0.42, CaCl2 0.062 (pCa 8.5), HEPES 10, adjusted to pH 7.3. ISO and IBMX were purchased from Sigma. L-858051 (L-85, a hydrosoluble analogue of forskolin), H89 and cilostamide were purchased from France Biochem (Meudon, France), and RO 20-1724 was gently provided by Hoffman-La-Roche (Basel, Switzerland). Data Analysis—The maximal amplitude of ICa,L was measured as the difference between the peak inward current and the current at the end of the 400-ms duration pulse (22Kirstein M. Rivet-Bastide M. Hatem S. Benardeau A. Mercadier J.J. Fischmeister R. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). ICNG amplitude is time-independent and was measured at the end of the 200-ms pulse. Currents were not compensated for capacitance and leak currents. In a total of 154 rat ventricular myocytes, mean capacitance was 157.3 ± 5.1 pF. ICNG density (dICNG) was calculated for each experiment as the ratio of current amplitude to cell capacitance. All the data are expressed as mean ± S.E. When appropriate, the Student's t test was used for statistical evaluation. The concentration-response curves (CRC) for the effects of ISO and L-85 on ICNG were fitted to the Hill equation: dICNG = Emax/(1+(EC50/[drug])n), where EC50 is the drug concentration ([drug]) required to produce half-maximal stimulation, Emax is the maximal effect, and n the Hill coefficient. For each agonist, the CRC obtained with the two CNGA2 channels were compared by a Fisher test. For both Student and Fisher tests, a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Immunocytochemistry—Cells attached onto coverslips were rinsed once in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) for 5 min, fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% (5 min) and washed in PBS (3 × 5 min). The cells were then permeabilized in Triton X-100 0.5% (15 min), washed in PBS (2 × 5 min) and once in PBS-BSA 1% (5 min). Next, they were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against CNGA2 (dilution 1:800, 1 h, 37 °C) This antibody was a generous gift from Drs. F. Mueller and B. Kaupp (Juelich, Germany). After three washes in PBS and one in PBS-BSA 1%, the cells were revealed with the Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-mouse antibody (30 min, 37 °C). After three additional washes in PBS, the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol antifadent mounting medium (France Biochem) and examined under a Carl Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) LSM 510 confocal scanning laser microscope. Optical sections series were obtained with a Plan Apochromat ×63 objective (NA 1.4, oil immersion). The fluorescence was observed with a LP 505-nm emission filter under 488-nm laser illumination. PDE Assays—For each assay, 5 × 105 freshly isolated rat ventricular myocytes were plated on 60-mm dishes and infected with Ad-CNG as described above. After 24 h of culture, the cells were preincubated. in control external Ringer (similar to that used in patch-clamp experiments, see composition above) supplemented or not with H89 (1 μm). After 30 min, cells were stimulated or not with 100 nm ISO or 10 μm L-85 during 5 min. Cells were homogenized at 4 °C in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 1 μm H89, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 1% Triton X-100, 160 μm of the serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 130 nm aprotinin, 8.3 μm bestatin, 2.5 μm E64, 3.3 μm leupeptin, and 1.6 μm pepstatin A) and centrifuged 15 min at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was kept at –80 °C until use. PDE activities were measured by radioenzymatic assay as previously described (23Keravis T.M. Wells J.N. Hardman J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 613: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) at a substrate concentration of 1 μm cAMP in the presence of 15,000 cpm [3H]cAMP as a tracer. The buffer solution was of the following composition: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm EGTA. H89 (1 μm) was added to this buffer to prevent phosphorylation of PDEs by exogenous cAMP. Assays of total cAMP hydrolytic activity and isoform-specific PDE activity were run in the same batch of experiments. Samples were diluted in order to have around 15% of hydrolysis in absence of specific inhibitors. PDE isoform-specific activities were determined as the difference between PDE activity in the absence of inhibitor and the residual hydrolytic activity observed in the presence of the selective inhibitor (24Stoclet J.-C. Keravis T. Komas N. Lugnier C. Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 1995; 4: 1081-1100Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The results were expressed as pmol min–1 mg prot–1. Proteins were determined according to Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrought N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. Functional Expression of Cyclic Nucleotide-gated Channels in Cardiac Myocytes—The E583M mutant of the α-subunit of rat olfactory CNG channels encoded into an adenoviral vector (Ad-CNG) was used as an indicator of cAMP in rat ventricular myocytes. This mutation increases the sensitivity of the channel to cAMP and decreases the sensitivity to cGMP (12Rich T.C. Tse T.E. Rohan J.G. Schaack J. Karpen J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Preliminary patch-clamp experiments were designed to test whether functional CNG channels could be detected in native and Ad-CNG-infected rat ventricular myocytes. Freshly isolated cells were infected or not with Ad-CNG at different MOI (see below), and the whole cell current at –50 mV was recorded 24 h after in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free external solution (7Rich T.C. Fagan K.A. Nakata H. Schaack J. Cooper D.M. Karpen J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The forskolin analogue L-85 was used to elevate intracellular cAMP. As shown in the individual current traces of Fig. 1A, application of L-85 at 100 μm had no effect on the current at –50 mV in non-infected cardiomyocytes (NI, n = 6) but activated a robust, time-independent inward current at this voltage in Ad-CNG-infected cells (n = 8). This current displayed other characteristic features of CNG currents, such as Mg2+ block (Fig. 1B) and a linear current-voltage relationship crossing at 0 mV (Fig. 1C). Such current was not detected in rat ventricular myocytes infected with a GFP-encoding adenovirus (n = 4, data not shown) and was thus attributed to the functional expression of E583M CNGA2. To determine the optimal virus to cell ratio to use in subsequent experiments, the effect of L-85 (100 μm) on the CNG current at –50 mV (ICNG) was compared in ventricular myocytes infected at three different MOI: 100, 600, and 3000 pfu/cell. As shown in Fig. 1D, the mean ICNG density (which represents the ratio of ICNG to cell membrane capacitance) upon application of 100 μm L-85 was 17.3 ± 7.2 pA/pF (MOI 100), 36.1 ± 9.0 pA/pF (MOI 600), and 50.1 ± 4.5 pA/pF (MOI 3000, n = 8 for each). Thus, the higher dose of MOI 3000 provided the wider dynamic range and increased the liability of the measure. The toxicity of Ad-CNG infection was evaluated by calculating the percentage of round myocytes at all three MOI and in non-infected cells. In 24 fields from 4 different dishes, totaling about 400 cells in each condition, this parameter was 14.8 ± 2.2% (non-infected), 10.2 ± 2.7% (MOI 100), 9.4 ± 1.3% (MOI 600) and 10.2 ± 0.3% (MOI 3000). Thus, Ad-CNG infection did not increase mortality at 24 h, even at a MOI of 3000. This virus to cell ratio was used in all subsequent experiments except for co-infection protocols where each adenovirus was used at MOI 600. Subcellular Localization of Recombinant CNG Channels—In a second series of experiments, CNGA2 expression was investigated by immunofluorescence in non-infected and Ad-CNG-infected myocytes after 24 h of culture. Fig. 2 shows confocal images of representative cells in both groups labeled with the monoclonal anti-CNGA2 or the secondary antibody alone. In non-infected cells, a weak longitudinal staining was observed in both conditions, and was thus attributed to nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody. In contrast, in rat ventricular myocytes infected with Ad-CNG, a strong fluorescent signal was observed throughout the cell, with accentuation at the extremities, around the nucleus, and in transversal stripes with a periodicity of ≈1.9 μm. Such pattern was not observed when the primary antibody against CNGA2 was omitted. These results suggest that the recombinant channel distributes ubiquitously at the membrane, with preferential localization in particular structures. Comparative Effects of ISO and L-85 on ICNG and ICa,L—We next tested whether CNG channels were able to detect cAMP increases elicited by a hormonal-like stimulation. Fig. 3A presents a typical experiment in which the effect of the sympathomimetic amine ISO was tested and compared with the effect of L-85 on ICNG at –50 mV. ISO at 100 nm induced a clear increase of ICNG, although ≈5 times smaller than that elicited by 100 μm L-85. In 7 similar experiments the mean current density was augmented from 4.3 ± 1.3 pA/pF in control Ringer to 10.9 ± 2.1 pA/pF with 100 nm ISO and to 51.4 ± 7.8 pA/pF with 100 μm L-85 (Fig. 3B). Comparable differences between ISO and L-85 were obtained at MOIs of 100 and 600 (data not shown). In order to link these results to a physiological process governed by β-adrenergic receptors in the heart, the regulation of the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) was examined with 1.8 mm [Ca2+] in the bath. At variance with what was observed on ICNG, ISO (100 nm), and L-85 (100 μm) exerted similar, maximal stimulatory effects on ICa,L, both in Ad-CNG-infected myocytes (MOI 3000) and in non-infected cells (Fig. 3C). This indicates: (i) that the β-adrenergic regulation of ICa,L was apparently not affected by CNG channel overexpression, and (ii) that limited cAMP signals elicited by a β-adrenergic stimulation are sufficient to fully activate L-type Ca2+ channels. Comparative Effects of Isoprenaline and L-858051 on ICNG Elicited by Two CNGA2 Mutants with Different Sensitivity to cAMP—The smaller current density obtained with ISO compared with L-85 may result from a weaker activation of the channels, or by the fact that only a given subset of channels is activated by the β-adrenergic agonist. To address this point, we compared the effects of ISO and L-85 on ICNG elicited by the E583M CNGA2 channel with those obtained with another CNGA2 variant, C460W/E583M, with a higher sensitivity to cAMP (12Rich T.C. Tse T.E. Rohan J.G. Schaack J. Karpen J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As expected, the CRC for the effect of L-85 on ICNG in cells expressing C460W/E583M was leftward-shifted compared with E583M (Fig. 4A). The forskolin analog started to activate ICNG significantly at 10 μm with C460W/E583M and at 30 μm with E583M, with a maximal effect obtained at 100 μm for both channels. The Hill fit of the data yielded an apparent half-maximal activation (EC50) and Hill coefficient (n) of 12.7 μm and 1.78 for C460W/E583M, and 36.7 μm and 1.53 for E583M, respectively, while the apparent maximal effects (Emax) were similar with both channels (59.9 pA/pF versus 61.4 pA/pF, respectively). The two curves were statistically different as indicated by Fisher test (p < 0.001). The Emax values reflected a saturation of the channels by cAMP since addition of the non-selective PDE inhibitor IBMX (100 μm) to 300 μm L-85 failed to further increase ICNG through E583M CNGA2 (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 4B, the results obtained with ISO differed substantially from those obtained with L-85. With both CNGA2 mutants, ISO started to increase ICNG density significantly at 10 nm, and the effect was maximal at 100 nm since a 10-times higher concentration produced no additional effect. The apparent EC50 and n values for ISO were 12.8 nm and 1.20 for C460W/E583M, and 22 nm and 1.45 for E583M, respectively, and apparent Emax was 20.5 pA/pF with C460W/E583M and 13.6 pA/pF with E583M. Comparison of the two CRC using the Fisher test indicated that the two curves were significantly different (p < 0.05). If one assumes that cAMP is uniformly distributed under both L-85 and ISO stimulations, then the lower saturating effect of ISO should be ascribed to its smaller capacity to raise the cAMP level. As indicated in Fig. 4C by the intersection between ISO CRC and L-85 CRC obtained with E583M, this level corresponds to that induced by ≈15 μm L-85. However, with this hypothesis, the effect of ISO on the double mutant channel C460W/E583M should rise as indicated by the arrow on Fig. 4C, to reach ≈37 pA/pF instead of 20.5 pA/pF. Thus, this clearly shows that the difference between ISO and L-85 is not simply caused by a different amount of cAMP generated. PKA Inhibition Unmasks Global cAMP Signals—The fact that CNG channels are directly opened by cAMP and are not regulated by PKA (26Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar) provides the unique possibility to investigate directly the role of this kinase in cAMP homeostasis. For this, the response of ICNG to β-adrenergic and L-85 stimulations were compared in the absence and presence of the PKA inhibitor H89 (27Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in myocytes infected with E583M Ad-CNG. The inhibitory effect of H89 on PKA was confirmed in separate experiments in which the drug antagonized PKA-mediated stimulation of the L-type Ca2+ channel current by IBMX. Indeed, 100 μm IBMX increased ICa,L by 139.3 ± 10.7% (n = 7) under control condition, but only by 51.5 ± 11.5% (n = 7) in the presence of 1 μm H89. While H89 antagonized cAMP stimulation of ICa,L, it stimulated cAMP activation of ICNG. Indeed, Fig. 5A shows a typical experiment in which ISO (100 nm) alone moderately increased ICNG, but induced a major activation of the current in the presence of 1 μm H89, that reached values close to those obtained upon application of 100 μm L-85. The summary of 9 similar experiments confirmed these findings (Fig. 5B), whereas H89 alone failed to modify ICNG, it greatly potentiated the effect of 100 nm ISO on ICNG density (12.5 ± 3.3 pA/pF versus 40.1 ± 9.4 pA/pF in the presence of H89), which became equivalent to that of 100 μm L-85 (41.6 ± 6.7 pA/pF). The effect of submaximal (10"

Yet IRAK1 knock-out mice still exhibit NFκB activation upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, suggesting that IRAK1 may play other un-characterized function. In this report, we show that IRAK1 is mainly involved in Stat3 activation and subsequent interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene expression. Splenocytes from IRAK1-deficient mice fail to exhibit LPS-induced Stat3 serine phosphorylation and IL-10 gene expression yet still maintain normal IL-1β gene expression upon LPS challenge. Mechanistically, we observe that IRAK1 modification upon LPS challenge leads to its modification, nuclear distribution, and interaction with Stat3. IRAK1 can directly use Stat3 as a substrate and cause Stat3 serine 727 phosphorylation. In addition, nuclear IRAK1 binds directly with IL-10 promoter in vivo upon LPS treatment. Atherosclerosis patients usually have elevated serum IL-10 levels. We document here that IRAK1 is constitutively modified and localized in the nucleus in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atherosclerosis patients. These observations reveal the mechanism for the novel role of IRAK1 in the complex Toll-like receptor signaling network and indicate that IRAK1 regulation may be intimately linked with the pathogenesis and/or resolution of atherosclerosis.

Numerous transcription factors including nuclear factor-κB (NFκB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), interferon regulatory factors, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) are shown to be activated upon challenges with various TLR ligands (4Beutler B. Hoebe K. Du X. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the selective activation of distinctive transcription factor is not clearly understood and may be caused by the differential recruitment of intracellular adaptor molecules such as MyD88, Mal/TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM as well as the downstream IRAK kinases (4Beutler B. Hoebe K. Du X. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar).IRAK1 was the first IRAK family kinase being identified to be associated with the intracellular domain of IL-1 receptor (5Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Since TLRs share the TIR domain with IL-1 receptor, it was hypothesized that IRAK1 may also participate in TLR mediated signaling. Subsequent work (6Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E.

IRAK1 can form a complex with MyD88, as well as TRAF6 (6Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Since the most apparent downstream target of LPS signaling is the activation of NFκB, IRAK1 is the apparent candidate to fulfill such role. Therefore, IRAK1 has historically been linked with IL-1/LPS-mediated NFκB activation. Yet the majority of published evidence supporting the role of IRAK1 in mediating IL-1/LPS-induced NFκB activation has been derived from studies employing cell lines with IRAK1 overexpression (12Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 13Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 339: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression, both the wild type and the kinase-dead IRAK1 (which has a point mutation in the ATP-binding pocket (K239S) or in the catalytic site (D340N)) can strongly induce NFκB reporter activation (12Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Maschera B. Ray K. Burns K. Volpe F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The fact that despite being an active kinase, its kinase activity is not required for its function raises the concern that IRAK1 may perform other novel unidentified function besides activating NFκB.Three related IRAK genes have been later identified, namely IRAK2, IRAK-M, and IRAK4 (13Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 15Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M.

A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). All IRAKs consist of a conserved N-terminal death domain and a central kinase domain. Upon overexpression, each of these IRAKs can activate the NFκB reporter gene, suggesting that they may play redundant roles in activating NFκB (13Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 17Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Casanova J.L. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26748-26753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, studies using transgenic mice have indicted otherwise. So far, IRAK1-/-, IRAK4-/-, and IRAK-M-/- transgenic mice have been generated. Mice with IRAK4 disruption exhibit marked reduction in NFκB activation upon LPS challenge (18Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Nature. 2002; 416: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sequence comparison with the fly IRAK counterpart pelle kinase suggests that IRAK4 is the structural orthologue of fly pelle kinase (16Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl.

In contrast, deletion of IRAK-M was shown to lead to elevated NFκB activity and pro-inflammatory gene expression such as tumor necrosis factor α, indicating that IRAK-M may negatively regulate NFκB activation (19Kobayashi K.

Intriguingly, IRAK1-deficient mice still retain LPS-induced NFκB activation (20Swantek J.L. Tsen M.F. Cobb M.H. Thomas J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4301-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), suggesting that IRAK1 may rather fulfill other distinct yet unidentified function in LPS/TLR signaling. Besides NFκB activation, TLR ligands such as LPS can also activate other transcription factors such as interferon regulatory factors and Stats (21Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Barnes B.J. Caffrey D.R.

Whether and which particular IRAK participates in the activation of interferon regulatory factors and/or Stats is not clear.In this study, we have characterized the gene expression pattern of murine splenocytes from wild type and IRAK1-deficient mice. We have found that IL-10 induction is severely compromised in IRAK1-deficient cells upon LPS challenge. In contrast, IL-1β gene expression is induced to a similar extent. Since Stat3 has been shown to be critical for IL-10 gene expression, we have further studied the Stat3 activation and phosphorylation status. We have observed that IRAK1-deficient cells exhibit defective nuclear Stat3 serine 727 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we have shown that LPS induces IRAK1 modification and nuclear localization. In addition, nuclear IRAK1 interacts with Stat3 as well as endogenous IL-10 promoter element upon LPS treatment.IL-10 is undetectable in normal healthy human sera or blood cells. However, under many pathological circumstances such as atherosclerosis, IL-10 message and protein can be readily detectable in the sera (23Mallat Z. Heymes C. Ohan J. Faggin E. Leseche G. Tedgui A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The production of IL-10 may help alleviate excessive inflammation and therefore be beneficial for the resolution of atherosclerosis. We have examined the IRAK1 status in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy and atherosclerosis patients. Our study shows that IRAK1 is constitutively modified and localizes inside the nucleus in atherosclerosis patient blood monocuclear cells (PBMC). Our finding reveals a novel role of IRAK1 in specifically mediating LPS-induced Stat3 activation and IL-10 expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Escherichia coli 0111:B4 LPS was obtained from Sigma. Antibody against IRAK1 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies against Stat3, phospho-Stat3(Ser727), and phospho-Stat3(Tyr705) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Murine and human IL-10 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were from BenderMed Systems (Vienna, Austria).Mice—C57BL/6 wild type mice were purchased from the Charles River laboratory. IRAK-deficient mice were a kind gift from Dr. James Thomas from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. These mice were bred and maintained in the animal facility at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine with the approved Animal Care and Use Committee protocol. All mice were 7-10 weeks of age when experiments were initiated. Splenocytes were harvested as described (24Feldmann K. Sebald W. Knaus P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar).Human Blood PBMC Isolation and Culture—Blood was drawn from healthy donors and atherosclerosis patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions at the Wake Forest University Medical Center with an approved protocol. PBMC were separated by Ficoll density gradient as described (25Mueller L.P. Yoza B.K. Neuhaus K. Loeser C.S. Cousart S. Chang M.C. Meredith J.W. Li L. McCall C.E. Shock. 2001; 16: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Isolated PBMC were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine.RNA Isolation and Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total cellular RNAs were extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) (26Li T. Hu J. Li L. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Isolated total RNAs were reverse-transcribed using the Qmniscript™ RT kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real-time PCR analyses of IL-10, IL-1β, as well as the control GAPDH mRNA transcripts were carried out using the assay-on-demand™ gene-specific fluorescently labeled TaqMan MGB probe in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems).Tansient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Activity Assay—HeLa-MAT cells stably expressing TLR4/MD2 (27Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. A total of 2 × 105 cells were co-transfected using DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) with the pIL-10Luci reporter plasmid (0.2 μg) and 1 μg of either wild type Stat3, Stat3-S727A, or Stat3-Y705A mutant plasmids (kindly provided by Dr. James Darnell, Rockefeller University). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with LPS at 500 ng/ml. Four hours later cells were harvested, and the lyses were used to perform luciferase assay (26Li T. Hu J. Li L. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).In Vitro Transcription/Translation and Phosphorylation Assay of Stat3—Wild type IRAK1 and wild type and Stat3-S727A mutant proteins were synthesized using the pflag-IRAK1, wild type Stat3, and Stat3-S727A mutant plasmids with the Promega TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). In vitro synthesized IRAK1 was incubated with either Stat3 or Stat3-S727A protein at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mmpara-nitrophenylphosphate, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine). Reaction products were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The phosphorylated as well as total Stat3 proteins were visualized by Western blot using antibodies specific for either Stat3-S727P or total Stat3 protein.Isolation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extracts, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot—Cell lysis, isolation of total, cytoplasmic, and nuclear extracts were as described previously (28Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, various cells (5 × 106/ml) were washed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, and subsequently lysed on ice in the lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). After centrifugation for 3 min at 12,000 rpm, the supernatant cytoplasmic fractions were transferred and saved. Pellets containing intact nuclei were lysed and solubilized with the high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min and yielded the nuclear extracts. Immunoprecipitation and Western detection of corresponding proteins were performed as described (7Li L. Cousart S. Hu J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Fresh and LPS-stimulated cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde (HCHO, from a 37% HCHO, 10% methanol stock (Calbiochem) into the medium for a final formaldehyde concentration of 1% and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with gentle shaking. Incubation with the lysis buffer was extended to 20 min at 4 °C. The chromatin was sheared by sonication using a Branson 250 sonicator with microtip at a power setting of 2 and 40% duty cycle. The samples were placed on ice for 1 min between sonication bursts. Each condition was divided into two samples, providing a preimmunoprecipitation or “input” sample that was not incubated with specific antibodies, and an immunoprecipitated “IP” sample that was incubated overnight with antibodies specific for IRAK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Preimmune IgG was used as a negative control. DNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol-precipitated, and re-suspended in 20 μl of distilled H2O. 4 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA was used for each PCR. The following primers specific for the IL-10 promoter -300- to -60-bp region were used: 5′ CAG CTG TTC TCC CCA GGA AA 3′ and 5′ AGG GAG GCC TCT TCA TTC AT 3′. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel. The amplified band was visualized using Bio-Rad Gel Doc™.Data Analysis—The significance of the data was evaluated by means of one-factor analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test using SPSS 10.0 software. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSIRAK1 Is Critical for IL-10 Gene Expression—To identify potential downstream gene targets of IRAK1, we prepared total RNAs from wild type and IRAK1-deficient splenocytes treated with or without LPS. Isolated RNAs were then used to perform cDNA microarray analysis using the Affymetrix mouse chip U74v2 and the data analyzed using the Affymetrix 4 and gene-spring data analysis software. We observed that several typical pro-inflammatory genes under the control of NFκB such as IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor α were induced to similar levels by LPS in both wild type and IRAK1-deficient splenocytes. In contrast, we identified that IL-10 message was only induced by LPS in wild type, but not IRAK1-deficient, splenocytes.To confirm the microarray data, we performed real-time PCR analysis of the induced IL-10 as well as IL-1β messages. Total RNAs isolated from wild type and IRAK1-deficient mice with or without LPS treatment were reverse-transcribed into cDNAs and subsequently subjected to real-time PCR analysis using the assay-on-demand IL-10, IL-1β, and the control GAPDH primer sets purchased from Applied Biosystems. GAPDH message levels remain steady in all the samples assayed. IL-10 message levels were undetectable after 40 cycles of amplifications in resting splenocytes from wild type as well as IRAK1-deficient mice. Upon LPS challenge, there was significant induction of IL-10 message in the wild type splenocytes (Fig. 1a). Based on the comparative Ct method, the induction of IL-10 by LPS was greater than at least 30-fold. In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference between IL-10 message levels in resting and LPS-treated splenocytes from IRAK1-deficient mice (Fig. 1a). On the other hand, we observed that IL-1β message levels were induced to a similar extent in wild type and IRAK1-deficient splenocytes by LPS (Fig. 1b). The amplified IL-10, IL-1β, and GAPDH mRNAs were also resolved and visualized on agarose gel (Fig. 1c). Subsequently, we measured IL-10 protein levels by ELISA. Wild type instead of IRAK1-deficient splenocytes produced a significant amount of IL-10 protein upon 16-h LPS treatment (Fig. 1d).Stat3 Serine Phosphorylation Necessary for IL-10 Gene Expression Requires the Presence of IRAK1—LPS-induced IL-10 gene expression has been shown to be mediated largely by Stat3 (22Benkhart E.M. Siedlar M. Wedel A. Werner T. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1612-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Stat3 activation is achieved through phosphorylation at the serine 727 and tyrosine 705 residues (29Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). To clarify that Stat3 phosphorylation indeed is critical for LPS-induced IL-10 gene transcription, we co-transfected HeLa-MAT cells stably carrying the TLR-4/MD-2 gene (27Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with the IL-10 promoter reporter plasmid pIL-10Luci (22Benkhart E.M. Siedlar M. Wedel A. Werner T. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1612-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) together with various Stat3 expression constructs. As shown in Fig. 2, LPS induced IL-10 reporter gene activation in cells co-transfected with wild type Stat3 construct. In contrast, there was no induction of IL-10 reporter activity in cells co-transfected with the Stat3 S727A or Y705A mutant, confirming that serine 727 as well as tyrosine 705 phosphorylation is essential for Stat3-mediated IL-10 gene transcription.Fig. 2Stat3 serine phosphorylation is essential for LPS-induced IL-10 gene transcription. HeLa-MAT cells were co-transfected with an IL-10-luciferase promoter-reporter plasmid (pIL-10Luci) and Stat3 wild type or Stat3 S727A and Stat3 Y705F mutant plasmids. Cells were then stimulated with LPS for 4 h. Results were presented as fold induction compared with cells without LPS treatment. *, p < 0.05 versus Stat3. All points represent the mean and S.E. from three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined the Stat3 phosphorylation status in wild type and IRAK1-deficient splenocytes. Splenocytes from wild type and IRAK1-deficient mice were treated with LPS. Total protein extracts were harvested and separated on SDS-PAGE. Total Stat3 as well as phosphorylated Stat3 were monitored by Western blot using anti-Stat3 and anti-phospho-Stat3 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, LPS induced Stat3 phosphorylation at both serine 727 and tyrosine 705 residues in wild type splenocytes. In contrast, LPS only induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation, but failed to induce serine 727 phosphorylation, in IRAK1-deficient splenocytes (Fig. 3a). We further fractionated the cell extracts into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Total Stat3 was present in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of splenocytes from wild type and IRAK1-deficient mice (Fig. 3b). LPS induced a dramatic increase of nuclear Stat3 serine 727 phosphorylation in the wild type splenocytes. Strikingly, serine 727-phosphorylated Stat3 was completely absent in the nuclear fraction from IRAK1-deficient splenocytes (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3Stat3 serine phosphorylation is compromised in IRAK1-deficient splenocytes. a, LPS fails to induce serine 727 phosphorylation in IRAK1-deficient splenocytes. Splenocytes from wild type and IRAK1-deficient mice were treated with LPS for 4 h. Whole cell lysates were collected, and immunoblot analyses were performed with anti-Stat3, phospho-Stat3(Ser727), and phospho-Stat3(Tyr705) antibodies b, LPS induces nuclear Stat3 serine 727 phosphorylation in the wild type but not IRAK1-deficient splenocytes. Primary splenocytes were treated as described for a. Cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions were prepared and used to immunoprecipitate Stat3. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for Stat3 serine 727 and total Stat3. The results are representative of three independent experiments. c, IRAK1 can directly phosphorylate Stat3 serine 727. IRAK1, wild type Stat3, and Stat3-S727A mutant proteins were synthesized using the Promega TNT Quick-coupled transcription/translation system. In vitro synthesized IRAK1 was incubated with either Stat3 or Stat3-S727A protein at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 μl of kinase buffer. Reaction products were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The phosphorylated as well as total Stat3 proteins were visualized by Western blot using antibodies specific for either Stat3-S727P or total Stat3 protein. KD, kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also examined whether IRAK1 could directly phosphorylate Stat3 serine 727. Wild type Stat3, Stat3-S727A mutant, as well as IRAK1 proteins were synthesized via in vitro transcription/translation as described under “Materials and Methods.” In vitro kinase assays were performed by mixing IRAK1 protein with either wild type Stat3 or Stat3-S727A mutant protein in the kinase buffer at 37 °C. Reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Total and Ser727-phosphorylated Stat3 proteins were detected through Western blot using anti-Stat3 and anti-Stat3-Ser727 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3c, IRAK1 can directly cause Stat3 serine 727 phosphorylation.IRAK1 and Stat3 Form a Novel Complex in the Nucleus—IRAK1 is known to undergo modification such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination upon IL-1 and/or LPS challenge. Intriguingly, it has been noted that IL-1β treatment may induce IRAK1 to localize inside the nucleus (30Bol G. Kreuzer O.J. Brigelius-Flohe R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To further determine the molecular mechanism for IRAK-mediated Stat3 activation, we analyzed IRAK1 protein status upon LPS challenge. Wild type splenocytes treated with or without LPS were harvested and used to prepare whole cell extract, cytoplasmic extract, as well as nuclear extract as described under “Materials and Methods.” The purities of prepared extracts were confirmed by probing for the presence of cytoplasmic and nuclear specific proteins. As shown in Fig. 4a, GAPDH was only detectable in the cytoplasmic extract, while Lamin-B was only visible in the nuclear extract. β-Actin was visualized to show equal loading of corresponding extracts. Equal amounts of isolated cellular extracts were subsequently used to immunoprecipitate IRAK1 protein. Immunoprecipitated IRAK1 was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-IRAK1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4b, LPS challenge caused a major shift of IRAK1 migration from ∼85 to ∼100 kDa, corresponding to the covalent IRAK1 modification likely due to ubiquitination and phosphorylation as reported by others (12Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We then examined the subcellular distribution of IRAK1 upon LPS challenge. Strikingly, as shown in Fig. 4b, unmodified IRAK1 (∼85 kDa) was only detectable in the cytoplasmic extract and completely absent in the nuclear extract. In contrast, modified IRAK1 was primarily present in the nuclear extract (Fig. 4b).Fig. 4LPS induces IRAK1 modification, nuclear entry, and interaction with Stat3 in murine splenocytes. a, the prepared cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts are devoid of cross-contamination. Whole cell (W), cytoplasmic (C), as well as nuclear (N) fractions were subjected to Western blot using anti-GAPDH, anti-Lamin-B, and β-actin. GAPDH and Lamin-B are cytoplasmic and nuclear markers, respectively. β-Actin is used as a marker of total amount of proteins per lane. b, LPS induces IRAK1 modification and nuclear entry in murine splenocytes. Splenocytes from wild type mice were left untreated or treated with LPS for 4 h. Whole cell (W), cytoplasmic (C), as well as nuclear (N) fractions were collected and used to perfo"

We propose that the sodium channel signaling complex at nodes of Ranvier includes the CAMs contactin, NrCAM, and Nf186 as well as ankyrinG and that sodium channels interact with these proteins via β1 subunits. In sciatic nerve, Nf186 and NrCAM are early markers of nodal formation that cluster at presumptive nodes prior to sodium channels and ankyrinG (2Custer A.W. Kazarinova-Noyes K. Sakurai T. Xu X.

In β1 (-/-) mice, contactin and sodium channels co-localize at optic nerve nodes of Ranvier but do not associate, confirming that interaction of these two molecules is dependent on the presence of β1 (9Chen C.

The number of mature nodes of Ranvier is significantly reduced in β1 (-/-) optic nerves, and we have proposed that the loss of sodium channel-contactin interactions at the node may be responsible for this effect (9Chen C.

The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that sodium channel β1 subunits participate in heterophilic cell-adhesive interactions with CAMs found in the axo-glial complex. We show that β1, expressed in the absence of sodium channel α subunits, interacts with NrCAM, Nf186, contactin, and Nf155. We observed an interaction of the β1 and β2 subunit extracellular domains only in the presence of a region of the β2 intracellular domain, suggesting that cytoskeletal interactions may affect β2-mediated heterophilic cell adhesion. We did not detect β1 interactions with sodium channel β3 subunits in our system. β1-Nf186 interactions result in increased sodium channel α subunit cell surface expression in vitro, similar to what we showed previously for contactin and β2. In contrast, although β1 is required for NrCAM interactions with Nav1.2, coexpression of β1 and NrCAM did not increase α subunit cell surface expression. These results suggest that β1 subunits interact with multiple CAMs to form the basis of the sodium channel complex at nodes of Ranvier. In addition, the present results showing β1 interaction with Nf155, coupled with our previous observation that β1 (-/-) mice lack septate-like junctions at the periphery of the nodal gap in a subset of CNS and PNS axons (9Chen C.

Briefly, the 3′ end of each β subunit cDNA fragment was defined by nucleotides A and G, which represent the first half of the introduced splice donor site (AG/GT). The amplified region with the splice donor site was then fused to the genomic sequence of the Fc region (hinge, CH2, and CH3) of the human IgG1, which bears a 3′ acceptor site into the pIG1 vector. The PCR fragment and the intron were sequenced and were determined to be free of mutations. Following transfection, the resulting pre-mRNAs were spliced by the cells to yield mature mRNAs that produce chimeric molecules containing the Ig-like domains of the β subunits and the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions of the human IgG1. The resulting chimeras are called β1-Fc, β2-Fc, and β3-Fc, respectively. Generation of β2 Truncation Mutants—Truncation mutants of the β2 intracellular domain were generated using polymerase chain reaction. β2Δ181–186 lacks the terminal six amino acids in the carboxyl domain, β2Δ174–186 lacks the terminal 13 amino acids, β2Δ169–186 lacks the terminal 18 amino acids, and β2Δ164–186 lacks the terminal 23 amino acids. Each truncation mutant was generated by substituting a termination signal (TAG) for Ala181, Lys174, Thr169, or Thr164, respectively. PCR products were then subcloned into the pCR2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and then subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1Zeo(-) (Invitrogen).

Immunoblots of cell supernatants from transiently transfected CHL fibroblasts indicated expression of all of the soluble Fc fusion proteins used (Fig. 1B). For each binding experiment, CHL cells were transiently transfected with the indicated CAM as described in the figure legends. To investigate binding interactions, cells were incubated with conditioned medium containing a particular Fc fusion protein. 36 h post-transfection and 12 h postincubation, the cells were fixed and stained for the expressed CAM using specific antibodies and for the Fc fusion protein of interest using a Cy3-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. None of the Fc fusion proteins showed binding to untransfected CHL cells above background (Fig. 1C). CHL cells transfected with β1 only did not bind the Fc protein backbone (Fig. 1C, c). Thus, any interaction that was observed between CHL cells transfected with β1 and incubated with the Fc fusion proteins was interpreted as a specific interaction between β1 and the Fc fusion protein. β1 Interacts with the Fibronectin-like Domains of Contactin—We have shown previously that contactin is part of the sodium channel complex at CNS nodes of Ranvier and may be involved in nodal formation during development and remyelination (17Kazarinova-Noyes K.

T. cruzi possesses a robust regulatory volume decrease mechanism that completely reverses cell swelling when submitted to hypo-osmotic stress. The efflux of amino acids and K+ release could account for only part for this volume reversal. In this work we demonstrate that swelling of acidocalcisomes mediated by an aquaporin and microtubule- and cyclic AMP-mediated fusion of acidocalcisomes to the contractile vacuole complex with translocation of this aquaporin and the resulting water movement are responsible for the volume reversal not accounted for by efflux of osmolytes. Contractile vacuole bladders were isolated by subcellular fractionation in iodixanol gradients, showed a high concentration of basic amino acids and inorganic phosphate, and were able to transport protons in the presence of ATP or pyrophosphate. Taken together, these results strongly support a role for acidocalcisomes and the contractile vacuole complex in osmoregulation and identify a functional role for aquaporin in protozoal osmoregulation.

Taken together, these results strongly support a role for acidocalcisomes and the contractile vacuole complex in osmoregulation and identify a functional role for aquaporin in protozoal osmoregulation. The obligate intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, which is the leading cause of cardiac death in endemic areas throughout Latin America. More than 11 million people are infected with the parasite, and some 40 million more are at risk (1Urbina J.A. Docampo R. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). As T. cruzi passes through its digenetic life cycle, it encounters many fluctuations in environmental conditions to which it must adapt in order to survive. Extreme fluctuations in osmolarity occur within the gut of the vector (2Kollien A.H. Grospietsch T. Kleffmann T. Zerbst-Boroffka I. Schaub G.A. J. Insect Physiol. 2001; 47: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Kollien A.H. Schaub G.A. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 381-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and also when the infective form of the parasite passes out of the vector in the highly concentrated excreta and rapidly encounters the interstitial fluid of the mammalian host with a much lower osmolarity. Physiological adaptations to hypo-osmotic stress have been studied extensively in a wide range of mammalian cell types as well as in unicellular eukaryotes. Upon exposure to a reduction in external osmolarity, cells initially swell but soon regain nearly normal cell volume by a process that has been termed the regulatory volume decrease (RVD 1The abbreviations used are: RVD, regulatory volume decrease; AMDP, aminomethylenediphosphonate; CVC, contractile vacuole complex; V-H+-PPase, vacuolar proton pyrophosphatase; Pi, inorganic phosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate; polyP, polyphosphate; DCCD, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; AM, tetraacetoxymethyl ester; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TcAQP, T. cruzi aquaporin.; reviewed in Ref. 4Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Volkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Haussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar), which is accomplished by the efflux of various inorganic ions (such as Na+ and K+) and organic osmolytes to the extracellular environment. Whereas in vertebrate cells inorganic ion efflux is much more important than organic osmolyte efflux, the most functionally significant efflux in unicellular eukaryotes, in terms of total contribution to RVD, seems to involve amino acids. Previous studies (5Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) on the response of T. cruzi to hypoosmotic stress have shown that both insect and vertebrate stages possess a robust RVD mechanism that completely reverses cell swelling following a 50% reduction in extracellular osmolarity. Approximately 50% of this compensatory volume reversal could be accounted for by the efflux of cytosolic amino acids (5Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies of other major osmolytes, such as sodium, potassium, chloride, inositol, methylamines, Pi, and pyrophosphate (PPi), failed to reveal another efflux mechanism that could account for the remaining volume reversal, except for K+ release that could account for only about 7% of the RVD (6, Rohloff, P. (2003) Osmoregulation in Trypanosoma cruzi: The Role of the Acidocalcisome. Ph.D. thesis, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignGoogle Scholar). In many unicellular eukaryotes the adaptation to hypo-osmotic stress involves, in addition to the release of ions and osmolytes as occurs in mammalian cells (7Steck T.L. Chiaraviglio L. Meredith S. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1997; 44: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the release of water by a contractile vacuole complex (CVC). Recent work (8Allen R.D. Naitoh Y. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 215: 351-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) has shown that most, if not all, CVCs are composed of a two-compartment system enclosed by two differentiated membranes. One membrane (spongiome), which is often divided into numerous vesicles and tubules, contains a proton-translocating V-H+-ATPase that provides an electrochemical gradient of protons for water transport and that can fuse only with the membrane of the second compartment. The membrane of the second compartment (bladder) expands into a reservoir for water storage and is capable of fusing with the plasma membrane. It is this second compartment that periodically undergoes contraction, with the expulsion of water (8Allen R.D. Naitoh Y. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 215: 351-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, other vacuoles besides the contractile vacuole bladder have been observed to take up water when protozoa are placed in hypo-osmotic media (9Cronkite D.L. Neuman J. Walker F. Pierce S.K. J. Protozool. 1991; 38: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10Temesvari L.A. Rodriguez-Paris J.M. Bush J.M. Zhang L. Cardelli J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1479-1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and they have been suggested also to play a role in volume homeostasis (11Van Rossum G.D.V. Russo M.A. Schisselbauer J.C. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1987; 30: 45-74Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have recently found that an aquaporin or a water channel is present in the contractile vacuole complex as well as in the acidocalcisomes of T. cruzi and suggested a role for these organelles in osmoregulation (12Montalvetti A. Rohloff P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38673-38682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Acidocalcisomes are acidic calcium-containing organelles present in a number of unicellular eukaryotes (13Docampo R. Moreno S.N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Ruiz F.A. Marchesini N. Seufferheld M. Govindjee Docampo R. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29971-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), that have been postulated to be involved in osmoregulation because they change their polyphosphate (polyP) (17Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and ionic (18LeFurgey A. Ingram P. Blum J.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 2001; 128: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) content when submitted to osmotic changes. It has been postulated that acidocalcisomes could act as a subcellular, osmotically active reservoir linked to the contractile vacuole function in both Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (14Ruiz F.A. Marchesini N. Seufferheld M. Govindjee Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46196-46203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and Dictyostelium discoideum (15Marchesini N. Ruiz F.A. Vieira M. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8146-8153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, acidocalcisomes could be the “vesicles” or “vacuoles” that have long ago been identified in free-living protozoa as transferring either water or osmolytes and ions to the spongiome linked to the CV (8Allen R.D. Naitoh Y. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 215: 351-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), because, as acidocalcisomes (13Docampo R. Moreno S.N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), they usually appear as indistinctive empty vesicles when examined under conventional transmission electron microscopy (8Allen R.D. Naitoh Y. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 215: 351-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study we have examined the role of the acidocalcisomes and the CVC in osmoregulation in T. cruzi. Hypo-osmotic stress resulted in a significant increase in cyclic AMP, swelling of the acidocalcisomes, and displacement of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-T. cruzi aquaporin (TcAQP) immunofluorescence labeling from the acidocalcisomes to the CVC in a microtubule- and cyclic AMP-dependent fashion. In addition, we isolated the contractile vacuole bladders, showed that they are enriched in alkaline phosphatase, V-H+-ATPase, and calmodulin, and found that they have large amounts of basic amino acids and Pi and that they are able to transport protons in the presence of ATP or PPi. RVD was inhibited by aquaporin inhibitors, by an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, and by a vacuolar H+-ATPase proteolipid subunit inhibitor, suggesting fusion of acidocalcisomes with the CVC. These fusion events with the CVC were also recorded. These results support a role for acidocalcisomes and the contractile vacuole complex in osmoregulation and identify a functional role for aquaporin in protozoal osmoregulation. Cell Culture—T. cruzi epimastigotes (Y strain) were grown at 28 °C in liver infusion tryptose medium (19Bone G. Steinert M. Nature. 1969; 178: 308-309Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum. GFP-TcAQP- or GFP-expressing epimastigotes (12Montalvetti A. Rohloff P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38673-38682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) were maintained in liver infusion tryptose medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1 mg/ml geneticin. Chemicals—Mammalian protease inhibitor mixture, β-glycerophosphate, dipyridamole, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 2-deoxy-3-AMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, bovine serum albumin, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), nigericin, EGTA, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, and pancreatin were from Sigma. Bafilomycin A1 was from Kamiya Biochemicals (Seattle, WA). Geneticin was from Invitrogen. Newborn calf serum was from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone (Logan, UT). Silicon carbide (400 mesh), chloralin, and fluorescamine were from Aldrich. Trifuralin was from Lilly. Iodixanol (60% solution, Optiprep, from Nycomed) was from Greiner Bio-One (Longwood, FL). Acridine orange was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Chemiluminescence (ECL) kit and kits for the determination of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP were from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were analytical grade. Mouse polyclonal antiserum was raised against the T. cruzi vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase (20Luo S. Vieira M.A. Zhong L. Graves J. Moreno S.N.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against a 17-amino acid C-terminal peptide from T. cruzi aquaporin (12Montalvetti A. Rohloff P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38673-38682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody (8B1) raised against the yeast 69-kDa V-H+-ATPase subunit was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Goat polyclonal antibody raised against an N-terminal 19-amino acid peptide from human calmodulin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-mouse Alexa 546 nm conjugate and rabbit anti-goat Alexa 546 nm conjugate were from Molecular Probes. Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate was from Sigma. Rabbit anti-goat 10-nm gold conjugate was from Ted Pella (Redding, CA). Cell Treatments—For experiments involving the induction of hypoosmotic stress, cells were washed extensively and resuspended in buffer A (116 mm NaCl, 5. 4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). The osmolarity of the buffer was adjusted to 300 ± 5 mOsm as verified by an Advanced Instruments 3D3 Osmometer (Norwood, MA). A 50% hypo-osmotic stress was induced by 1:1 dilution of cell suspensions in buffer A with deionized water. Cell Volume Measurements—Relative changes in cell volume after induction of hypo-osmotic stress were followed by using a light scattering technique as described previously (5Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6, Rohloff, P. (2003) Osmoregulation in Trypanosoma cruzi: The Role of the Acidocalcisome. Ph.D. thesis, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignGoogle Scholar). Cyclic AMP and Cyclic GMP Determinations—Cells were suspended at a concentration of 2 × 108 per ml and preincubated with 1 mm IBMX for 10 min in Dulbecco's PBS supplemented with 5 mm glucose. Then they were diluted with either water or buffer to 1 × 108 cells per ml. Aliquots of 0.5 ml were taken at the times indicated, centrifuged, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS and 400 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, preheated to 95 °C. These samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, centrifuged, and the supernatants collected and stored at –20 °C. Cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP measurements were done using the Amersham Bioscience kits with the acetylation protocol. Electron Microscopy—For conventional electron microscopy, cells or subcellular fractions were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde, washed in Dulbecco's PBS, and then embedded in epoxide resin, sectioned, and stained using standard methods. Grids were observed using an Hitachi 600 transmission electron microscopy operating at 75 kV. For morphometric analysis of acidocalcisomes, the diameter of acidocalcisomes in randomly selected cells was measured at ×40,000 magnification. At least 40 acidocalcisomes were measured from each treatment group (hypo-osmotic, isosmotic) in each of four independent experiments. Fluorescence Microscopy and Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, adhered to poly-l-lysine coverslips, permeabilized for 5 min with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.3% Triton X-100, blocked for 1 h with PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% fish gelatin, 5% goat serum, 50 mm NH4Cl, and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h and then secondary antibody for 45 min. For visualization of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, the 8B1 monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) was used at 1:10, followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa 546 nm conjugate at 1:1000. For detection of calmodulin, goat polyclonal anti-calmodulin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:50, followed by rabbit anti-goat Alexa 546 conjugate at 1:1000. Specimens were observed with a Leica TCS SP2 laser-scanning confocal microscope. For assessment of GFP-TcAQP translocation, cells were exposed to hypo-osmotic stress for various times, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, adhered to poly-l-lysine coverslips, and visualized by epifluorescence microscopy. For each treatment or time point, at least 50 cells were randomly selected and examined. A “nontranslocation” phenotype was recorded when several scattered vesicular localizations of the GFP-TcAQP could be observed; a “translocation phenotype” was recorded when all the GFP-TcAQP fluorescence was concentrated in a single region near the flagellar pocket. Results were expressed as % translocated cells out of the total number of cells examined. Trypanosome Immobilization and Acidocalcisome Tracking—Epimastigotes overexpressing GFP-TcAQP were immobilized onto glass surfaces coated with coral tree lectin (Erythrina cristagalli), which interacts with glycoproteins located on the parasite surface membrane containing oligosaccharides with galactosyl (β-1,4)-N-acetylglucosamine. Cells were immobilized on coverslips in 4- or 8-well plates. The lectin was dissolved in Dulbecco's PBS at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Glass surfaces coated with poly-l-lysine were treated with the lectin solution for 30 min. The solution was then removed, and the lectin-coated surface allowed to air-dry under a laminar flow hood. Epimastigotes in logarithmic phase of growth were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in buffer A without glucose (116 mm NaCl, 5. 4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). The osmolarity of the buffer was adjusted to 300 ± 5 mOsm. Cells were allowed to attach for 30 min at room temperature. Unattached cells were removed, and the wells were rinsed three times with buffer A. To induce translocation of GFP-TcAQP toward the contractile vacuole, buffer A was replaced by the same buffer diluted 1:1 with deionized water or with 500 μm dibutyryl cAMP under isosmotic conditions. Specimens were observed with a Leica TCS SP2 laser-scanning confocal microscope or a two-photon microscope as described before (21Levi V. Ruan Q. Kis-Petikova K. Gratton E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Video Microscopy—For microscopic analysis of contractile vacuole filling and vesicle fusion, epimastigotes were immobilized on glass slides with coral tree lectin as described above, bathed in 150 mOsm hypo-osmotic buffer, and viewed with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted microscope. Time lapse photographic data were collected at 1-s intervals using a Roper Scientific Coolsnap camera and MCID software. Video sequences were reconstructed using QuickTime and Final Cut Pro software. Cytochemistry—For cytochemical detection of alkaline phosphatase, a modification of a method described previously was used (22Quiviger B. de Chastellier C. Ryter A. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1978; 62: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 50 mm cacodylate, pH 6.8, 200 mm sucrose, washed twice for 30 min in the same buffer, and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of reaction medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 200 mm sucrose, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 2.6 mm lead citrate. Lead citrate was prepared as described previously (23Reynolds D. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17782) Google Scholar). The cell suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen for 3 min to permeabilize the cells and then thawed by the addition of 4.5 ml of reaction medium. The suspension was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, washed three times with 50 mm cacodylate, pH 6.8, 200 mm sucrose, and embedded in epoxide resin for visualization by transmission electron microscopy. Western Blotting—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using standard methods. All the following steps were performed in Dulbecco's PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk and washed three times, incubated with polyclonal anti-aquaporin antibody at 1:1000 for 1 h and washed three times, incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase at 1:10,000 for 1 h and washed three times, and then the bands were detected by chemiluminescence. Contractile Vacuole Isolation and Characterization—Contractile vacuoles and acidocalcisomes were isolated simultaneously on discontinuous iodixanol density gradients by using a modification of a method described previously (24Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A cell pellet collected from 100 ml of late-log epimastigote culture was disrupted by grinding with silicon carbide; the lysate was clarified by three low speed centrifugations (two times at 36 × g and one time at 144 × g), and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellet was loaded into the 24% layer of an iodixanol gradient containing 4-ml steps of 15, 20, 24, 28, 34, 37, and 40%. The gradient was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 60 min, and 1-ml fractions (27 in all) were collected from the top. Aliquots of each collected fraction were assayed for enzymatic markers of lysosomes (α-mannosidase), acidocalcisomes (vacuolar-type (AMDP-sensitive) H+-pyrophosphatase), mitochondria (alanine amino-transferase), glycosomes (hexokinase), and contractile vacuole (alkaline phosphatase) as described previously (14Ruiz F.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28020-28029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Vacuolar-type (bafilomycin A1-sensitive) H+-ATPase was assayed as described previously (14Ruiz F.A. Marchesini N. Seufferheld M. Govindjee Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46196-46203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Aliquots were also assayed for amino acid, Pi, and polyP content as described previously (5Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Acidification of isolated contractile vacuole fractions was assayed by measuring changes in the absorbance of acridine orange (A493–A530 nm) as described previously (26Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.G. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in an SLM-Aminco DW2000 dual wave-length spectrophotometer. Aliquots of contractile vacuole fractions were incubated at 30 °C in 2.5 ml of 65 mm KCl, 125 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm K+-Hepes, 50 μm EGTA, pH 7.2, containing 3 μm acridine orange. Other compounds (PPi, ATP, NH4Cl, AMDP, and nigericin) were added at the times and concentrations indicated in the appropriate figure legend. Membrane Integrity and Amino Acid Release—Membrane integrity after treatment with AgNO3 and HgCl2 was determined by ethidium bromide exclusion as described before (5Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Total amino acid content and amino acid analysis of the supernatants of cells exposed to hypotonic or isotonic buffer were determined as described before (5Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). HgCl2 and AgNO3 Inhibit the RVD in Epimastigotes—In a previous study (12Montalvetti A. Rohloff P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38673-38682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) we identified an aquaporin (TcAQP) that is located in acidocalcisomes and the contractile vacuole complex of T. cruzi epimastigotes. In contrast to other aquaporins that are inhibited by high micromolar concentrations of either HgCl2 or AgNO3 (27Hansen M. Kun J.F. Schultz J.E. Beitz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4874-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Niemietz C.M. Tyerman S.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), TcAQP was shown to be exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by very low concentrations of these compounds (12Montalvetti A. Rohloff P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38673-38682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We therefore treated cells with 1 μm of either HgCl2 or AgNO3, a concentration shown previously to inhibit osmotic swelling in Xenopus laevis oocytes transfected with TcAQP (12Montalvetti A. Rohloff P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38673-38682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and we then monitored the rate of volume recovery during hypo-osmotic stress. Relative volume was followed over time using the light-scattering technique as described previously (5Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), in which changes in absorbance of a cell suspension are negatively correlated with changes in cell volume. Both inhibitors significantly reduced the rate of volume recovery (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, this inhibitory effect was not because of interference with hypo-osmotically induced amino acid efflux (Fig. 1C) and was not because of a general toxic effect of the compounds, because the magnitude of amino acid release was unaffected by pretreatment with either HgCl2 or AgNO3 (Fig. 1C). Epimastigotes under isosmotic conditions treated with either 1 μm HgCl2 or 1 μm AgNO3 for 5 min showed neither morphological nor motility alterations and did not increase their permeability to ethidium bromide (Fig. 1D), indicating the absence of toxic side effects by these low salt concentrations. Taken together, these results suggest a central role for TcAQP in the response of the parasites to hypo-osmotic stress. GFP-TcAQP Translocation during Hypo-osmotic Stress— Based on analogy to vasopressin-stimulated translocation of AQP-2-containing vesicles in the mammalian kidney collecting ducts (29Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 30Gustafson C.E. Levine S. Katsura T. McLaughlin M. Aleixo M.D. Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the possibility of a hypo-osmotically induced TcAQP translocation event was studied in GFP-TcAQP expressing epimastigotes. As reported before (12Montalvetti A. Rohloff P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38673-38682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), GFP-TcAQP localized to acidocalcisomes (arrowheads) and to the contractile vacuole (Fig. 2B, arrow). When cells were stressed and observed microscopically, the GFP-TcAQP-containing acidocalcisomes that were closer to the contractile vacuole could be observed migrating toward it (see below). In many cells (Fig. 2D) only the fluorescent spot corresponding to the contractile vacuole could be observed because it became brighter after hypo-osmotic stress, and less fading of this signal than that of the acidocalcisomes occurred. We therefore investigated whether it was possible to image the movement of acidocalcisomes in live cells submitted to hypo-osmotic stress or in the presence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (500 μm, see below) either by video fluorescence microscopy or by a new method for three-dimensional particle tracking termed scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (21Levi V. Ruan Q. Kis-Petikova K. Gratton E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Because epimastigotes are very motile cells, they needed to be immobilized to follow these changes. This was successfully achieved by attaching them to coverslips covered with coral tree lectin (see “Experimental Procedures”). Periodic filling of the contractile vacuole could be followed by phase microscopy when epimastigotes were incubated in the buffer at 150 mOsm (Fig. 3A; see also movie 1 under Supplemental Material). However, attempts to follow the movement of acidocalcisomes using video fluorescence microscopy, or scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy using a two-photon microscope, were unsuccessful, due in part to the small size of the acidocalcisomes and also the fa"

Several extracellular factors have been identified that participate in the regulation of myogenesis. Although skeletal muscles are always subjected to mechanical stress in vivo, the role of mechanical forces in the regulation of myogenesis remains unknown. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which cyclic mechanical strain modulates myogenesis. Application of cyclic mechanical strain using the computer-controlled Flexcell Strain Unit increased the proliferation of C2C12 cells and inhibited their differentiation into myotubes. Cyclic strain increased the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) and the cellular level of cyclin A, and inhibited the expression of myosin heavy chain and formation of myotubes in C2C12 cultures. The activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcription factor and the expression of NF-kappaB-regulated genes, cyclin D1 and IL-6, were augmented in response to mechanical strain. Cyclic strain also increased the activity of Rho GTPases, especially Rac-1. The inhibition of Rho GTPases activity, by overexpression of Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (Rho-GDI), inhibited the strain-induced activation of NF-kappaB in C2C12 cells. Overexpression of either NF-kappaB inhibitory protein IkappaBalphaDeltaN (a degradation resistant mutant IkappaBalpha) or Rho-GDI blocked the strain-induced proliferation of C2C12 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of FRNK, a dominant negative mutant of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), inhibited the strain-induced proliferation of C2C12 cells. Our study demonstrates that cyclic mechanical strain inhibits myogenesis through the activation of FAK, Rac-1, and NF-kappaB."
https://openalex.org/W2170170098,"Thyroid hormone (TH) actions are mediated by nuclear receptors (TRs α and β) that bind triiodothyronine (T3, 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine) with high affinity, and its precursor thyroxine (T4, 3,5,3′,5′-tetraiodo-l-thyronine) with lower affinity. T4 contains a bulky 5′ iodine group absent from T3. Because T3 is buried in the core of the ligand binding domain (LBD), we have predicted that TH analogues with 5′ substituents should fit poorly into the ligand binding pocket and perhaps behave as antagonists. We therefore examined how T4 affects TR activity and conformation. We obtained several lines of evidence (ligand dissociation kinetics, migration on hydrophobic interaction columns, and non-denaturing gels) that TR-T4 complexes adopt a conformation that differs from TR-T3 complexes in solution. Nonetheless, T4 behaves as an agonist in vitro (in effects on coregulator and DNA binding) and in cells, when conversion to T3 does not contribute to agonist activity. We determined x-ray crystal structures of the TRβ LBD in complex with T3 and T4 at 2.5-Å and 3.1-Å resolution. Comparison of the structures reveals that TRβ accommodates T4 through subtle alterations in the loop connecting helices 11 and 12 and amino acid side chains in the pocket, which, together, enlarge a niche that permits helix 12 to pack over the 5′ iodine and complete the coactivator binding surface. While T3 is the major active TH, our results suggest that T4 could activate nuclear TRs at appropriate concentrations. The ability of TR to adapt to the 5′ extension should be considered in TR ligand design.

Most TH produced in the thyroid gland is secreted in the form of thyroxine (T4; 3,5,3′,5′-tetraiodo-l-thyronine) (2Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar, 3Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. 8th Ed. Werner's and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000Google Scholar). The thyroid gland also produces smaller amounts of triiodothyronine (T3; 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine) and reverse T3 (rT3; 3,3′,5′-triiodo-l-thyronine), and 80% of T4 is converted to T3 and rT3 in peripheral tissues by two selenium deiodinases, which are tissue-specific (4Kohrle J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Current beliefs are that T3 is the dominant active form of TH; T3 binds the TRs with an affinity about 20-30 times higher than that of T4 (5Samuels H.H. Stanley F. Casanova J. J. Clin.

Purif. 1995; 6: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and some studies suggest that T3 is present at higher concentrations in the nucleus than T4 (10Surks M.I. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1977; 60: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Silva J.E. Larsen P.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1978; 61: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the question of whether T4 is simply a prohormone or an active TH species is not completely resolved. T4 exerts rapid nongenomic effects at several loci distinct from TRs (12Davis P.J. Tillmann H.C. Davis F.B. Wehling M. J. Endocrinol. Investig. 2002; 25: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, saturating levels of T4 activate transcription of TH-responsive genes in cell culture (see for example Ref. 5Samuels H.H. Stanley F. Casanova J. J. Clin. Investig. 1979; 63: 1229-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Whereas it is possible that at least some of this activity is due to T3 generated from T4 in the cell, these results suggest that T4 may act as a TR agonist. Normal concentrations of plasma-free T4 are about 4-6-fold higher than those of T3 (19 pmol/liter of T4 versus 4.3 pmol/liter T3) and intracellular T4 and T3 levels can differ because of variations in uptake and T4 to T3 conversion (3Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. 8th Ed. Werner's and Ingbar's The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000Google Scholar); thus, it is conceivable that intracellular T4 in some context could occupy a significant fraction of nuclear TRs. If T4 does behave as an agonist, then it should bind to TR in a similar way to T3 and induce conformational changes in the TR similar to those induced by T3 (13Weatherman R.V. Fletterick R.J. Scanlan T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 559-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 14Ribeiro R.C. Apriletti J.W. Wagner R.L. Feng W. Kushner P.J. Nilsson S. Scanlan T.S. West B.L.

T3 interacts with the TR ligand binding domain (LBD), located in the receptor C terminus. The x-ray crystal structure of TRα or TRβ complexed with T3 reveals that hormone is completely enclosed in a ligand binding pocket within the core of the LBD. It is thought that the enclosure is due to ligand-induced packing of the LBD C-terminal helix 12 (H12) against the LBD; a rearrangement that also disrupts the corepressor binding surface and completes the coactivator binding surface, leading to exchange of coregulators and influence on gene expression in vivo (15Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike T3, T4 possesses a bulky iodine substituent at the 5′-position of the first thyronine ring. X-ray crystal structures have been determined for TR-LBDs complexed with several different high affinity agonists, including T3, Dimit (3, 5-dimethyl-3′isopropyl-l-thyronine), and the TRβ-specific ligands GC-1 (3,5 dimethyl-4-(4-hydroxy-3′-isopropylbenzyl)-phenoxy acetic acid), and KB141 (3,5-dichloro-4-[(4-hydroxy-3-isopropylphenoxy)phenyl] acetic acid) (16Wagner R.L.

In each of these cases, the agonist contains a 5′ hydrogen group that lies close to the inner surface of H12. We therefore predicted that compounds with bulky side groups would perturb the folding of H12 against the body of the LBD and exploited this feature to create TR antagonists based on the notion that 5′ extensions would preclude appropriate H12 packing and coactivator binding (19Scanlan, T.

Chem. 2002; 45: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For example, addition of a 5′ isopropyl group, similar in size to an iodine group, to the agonist MIBRT (3,5-dibromo-4-(3′isopropyl-4′-hydroxyphenoxy)benzoic acid) creates the TR antagonist DIBRT (3,5-dibromo-4-(3′,5′-diisopropyl-4′-hydroxyphenoxy)benzoic acid) (22Baxter J.D. Goede P. Apriletti J.W. West B.L. Feng W. Mellstrom K. Fletterick R.J. Wagner R.L. Kushner P.J. Ribeiro R.C.J. Webb P. Scanlan T.S. Nilsson S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that T4, with a 5′ iodine extension, could even behave as an antagonist in some settings. Improved understanding of the way that the TRs adapt to the 5′ iodine group will be therefore important for understanding T4 action and key principles of NR antagonist design. In this study, we examine T4 interactions with TR, the way that T4 influences TR activity in vitro and in cells in culture and determined the x-ray crystal structure of TR in complex with T4. We find that the TR-T4 complex is less stable than the TR-T3 complex, and that T4-liganded TRs exhibit properties that are similar to unliganded TRs in solution. Nonetheless, T4 behaves as an agonist in cell-free assays and transfected cells. The x-ray structure of the TR LBD-T4 complex reveals that a previously undetected niche in the ligand binding pocket widens, relative to the size of the pocket observed in the TRβ-T3 complex, to accommodate the 5′ iodine, permitting H12 to pack against the LBD surface in the presence of the larger ligand. Thus, the enclosed TR hormone binding pocket accommodates T4 without complete disruption of overall TR-LBD structure. These results suggest that T4 will act largely as a TR agonist if present at high enough concentrations in the nucleus. Thyroid Hormone Binding Assay—Thyroid hormone binding and analog competition assays were performed as previously described (9Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. Lau K.H. West B.L. Protein Expr. Purif. 1995; 6: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Kd values were calculated by fitting saturation curves and competition data to the equations of Swillens (25Swillens S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1197-1203PubMed Google Scholar) using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography of TR—TR-LBDs were expressed in E. coli and partially purified on phenyl-Toyopearl, TSKDEAE, TSK-heparin, and TSK-phenyl columns without TH as described previously (9Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. Lau K.H. West B.L. Protein Expr. Purif. 1995; 6: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For each analog tested, TR was incubated for 1 h with a 5-fold molar excess of the analog relative to the final TR concentration, ammonium sulfate concentration was adjusted to 0.7 m, and the sample was loaded and chromatographed on a 0.8 × 7.5 cm TSK-phenyl column (Tosoh Biosep, Montgomeryville, PA) at 0.75 ml/min with a 60-min gradient from 0.7 m ammonium sulfate, no glycerol to no salt, 20% glycerol. TR levels were assessed by measuring absorption at 280 nm and, where appropriate, radiolabeled T4 in complex with the TR was detected by scintillation.

Binding experiments were performed by mixing glutathione-linked Sepharose beads containing 4 μg of GST fusion proteins (Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent, Pierce) with 1-2 μl of 35S-labeled TR in 150 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors, and 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 1.5 h. Beads were washed three times with 200 μl of binding buffer, and bound proteins were separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—In vitro translated TR was produced in reticulocyte lysates, TnT T7 Quick (Promega), and 20 fmols of translated receptor were incubated with 300,000 cpm of [γ-32P]ATP-radiolabeled F2 oligonucleotides and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in a 20-μl volume (29Ribeiro R.C.

The binding buffer contained 25 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ZnSO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol. After 30 min at room temperature, the mixture was loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel that was previously run for 30 min at 200 V. To separate TR-DNA complexes, the gel was run at 4 °C for 120-180 min at 200 V, using a running buffer containing 45 mm Tris borate (pH 8.0), and 1 mm EDTA. Reporter Cells—The assay procedure, described previously (22Baxter J.D. Goede P. Apriletti J.W. West B.L. Feng W. Mellstrom K. Fletterick R.J. Wagner R.L. Kushner P.J. Ribeiro R.C.J. Webb P. Scanlan T.S. Nilsson S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), utilized Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing TRα1 and TRβ1 containing a stably integrated reporter gene with a single TRE (DR-4) cloned into the position of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter hormone response element, driving expression of alkaline phosphatase coding sequences. Crystallization and Data Collection—The TRβ LBD was purified for crystallization trials using cobalt affinity and hydrophobic interaction chromatography first without and then with hormone as previously described (18Wagner R.L. Huber B.R. Shiau A.K. Kelly A. Cunha Lima S.T. Scanlan T.S. Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. West B.L. Fletterick R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 398-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Crystals of the T3 complex were obtained by the hanging drop method, with a 10.5 mg/ml protein stock solution and mother liquor consisting of 100 mm sodium cacodylate and 900 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.2. Crystals were cryoprotected by immersion in sequential baths of 100 mm sodium cacodylate and 1.1 m sodium acetate, pH 7.2, with 3, 8, and 15% glycerol. Crystals were subjected to a final swipe through a bath with 25% glycerol before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of the T4 complex were obtained similarly, with a crystallization mother liquor of 100 mm sodium cacodylate and 700 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.4. Use of extremely fresh protein and microseeding with Triac-hTRβ LBD crystals (< 0.1% of the final crystal) were found to be essential to obtaining diffraction quality crystals. Crystals were then cryoprotected using sequential glycerol baths as for the T3 complex, but with a mother liquor of 100 mm sodium cacodylate and 900 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.4. Crystals were analyzed at the Advanced Light Source synchrotron facility, beamline 5.02. For the T3 complex, 135° of data were collected with 1.5° oscillations; for the T4 complex, 73° of data were collected with 0.5° oscillations. Reflections were indexed in DENZO and scaled in SCALEPACK. Structural Refinement of the T3Complex—A molecular replacement solution was found using EPMR, employing the wild-type TRβ/TRIAC structure with hormone omitted as a probe. The structure was then subjected to multiple rounds of simulated annealing, followed by positional and B-factor refinement in CNS. Occupancies were refined in CNS for arsenic atoms only. Refinement was then continued using REFMAC of the CCP4 suite. In the final stages of refinement, water molecules were added to the structure both manually and in ARP/wARP. Refinement steps alternated with manual rebuilding steps in Quanta98 and O, guided by Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc maps calculated using FFT of the CCP4 suite, and a simulated annealing omit map calculated using CNS. Structural Refinement of the T4Complex—The T4 data set was subjected to molecular replacement in EPMR and simulated annealing and positional, B-factor, and occupancy refinement in CNS as for the T3 complex. In light of the markedly higher resolution of the data for the T3 complex, the refined T3 structure was then least squares fitted in O to the model of the T4 complex. A composite model consisting of protein from the fitted T3 complex and ligand from the T4 complex was created and used for subsequent refinement against the T4 complex data. To guard against model bias, this composite model was subjected to simulated annealing and positional refinement in CNS. However, this treatment raised Rfree markedly, as compared with Rfree of the composite after positional refinement only. This indicates that the true structure of the T4 complex is close to the T3 complex model used to create the composite. Subsequent refinement and model rebuilding were carried out as described above for the T3 complex. The TR-T4Complex Is Less Stable Than the TR-T3Complex and Adopts a Different Conformation in Solution—We first investigated interactions of TRs with T3 and T4 (Fig. 1A). We previously determined that T3 has an affinity for TRs (Kd = 0.06 nm) about 30-fold higher than T4 (Kd = 2 nm) (6Apriletti J.W. Eberhardt N.L. Latham K.R. Baxter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12094-12101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T4 also dissociates from TRs more rapidly than T3 (Fig. 1, B and C). Whereas it took 8.4 and 6.2 h for half the T3 to dissociate from in vitro translated preparations of TRα and TRβ at 4 °C, it only took about 0.15 h and 0.06 h for half of the T4 to dissociate from TRα and TRβ, respectively. Thus, TRs form a complex with T4 that is significantly less stable than the TR-T3 complex. We next examined elution of T4-liganded TRs from TSK-phenyl hydrophobic interaction columns (HIC), an assay that detects ligand-dependent conformational alterations in TR-LBDs and provides a crude index of hydrophobicity (9Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. Lau K.H. West B.L. Protein Expr. Purif. 1995; 6: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In accordance with previous results (9Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. Lau K.H. West B.L. Protein Expr. Purif. 1995; 6: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), liganded TRα-LBDs eluted ahead of unliganded TRs (Fig. 2A). Moreover, TR preparations in complex with several agonists T3, Triac (3,3′,5′-triiodothyroacetic acid), 3′-IpT2 (3′-isopropyl-3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine), and Dimit eluted nearly together, with elution order paralleling relative affinities of ligand for TR (T3 = Triac > IpT2 > Dimit). By contrast, the TRα-T4 complex eluted closer to unliganded TR. Similar results were also obtained with the TRβ LBD; the TRβ-T4 complex eluted from the column between the TRβ-T3 complex and unliganded TRβ (Fig. 2B). It is unlikely that the unusual elution profile of the TR-T4 complex is related to the low affinity of T4 for TRs; the TRα-Dimit complex eluted at a similar position to other TR agonist complexes even though Dimit binds TRα with an affinity five times lower than T4 (Kd = 9 nm for Dimit versus 2 nm for T4). It is also unlikely that the unusual elution profile is related to rapid T4 release during passage over HIC. Continuous dissociation of T4 would lead to a broad curve and not a discrete symmetric peak as observed here, although the “shoulder” observed with the TRβ-T4 complex may reflect T4 dissociation (Fig. 2B). Nonetheless, we directly examined migration of [125I]T4 prebound to TRα on HIC (Fig. 2C). Radiolabeled T4 migrated at the same position as the TRα-T4 complex, whereas free T4 did not elute from the column in these timescales (not shown), confirming that TR remains bound to T4 as it passes over HIC. Thus, the unique elution profile of the TR-T4 complex reflects an unusual conformation that exposes more hydrophobic surface than TRs in complex with T3 or other analogues. Modulator Binding Properties of TR-T4Complexes Resemble Those of TR-T3Complexes—We next determined whether T4 behaved as an agonist under cell-free conditions. Fig. 3A shows that T4 and T3 promoted equivalent levels of TR binding to bacterially expressed nuclear receptor interacting regions of the coactivators GRIP1 and TRAP220. T4 and T3 also showed comparable activity in promoting binding of radiolabeled full-length GRIP1 and TRAP220 to bacterially expressed TRβ-LBD (not shown). Finally, both ligands promoted TR release from bacterially expressed preparations of the receptor-interacting region (C terminus) of the corepressor, N-CoR (Fig. 3B). Thus, T4 and T3 behave as agonists in cell-free conditions. TR agonists promote near complete dissociation of TR dimers, but not RXR-TR heterodimers, from DNA response elements (TREs) containing half-sites aligned as inverted palindrome (F2/IP-6) or direct repeats (DR-4) (29Ribeiro R.C. Kushner P.J. Apriletti J.W. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1142-1152PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ribeiro R.C. Apriletti J.W. Yen P.M. Chin W.W. Baxter J.D. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2076-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). T4 and T3 both promoted TRα homodimer release from an F2/IP-6 element and enhanced interactions of TR monomers with the same element (Fig. 4). Both forms of TH only modestly reduced RXR-TRα heterodimer binding in the same conditions. Similar results were also obtained using DR-4, and with TRβ and both TREs (not shown). Nonetheless, TR migration was slower in the presence of T4 than T3 (this was most evident for the monomer). Thus, T4 resembles T3 in terms of regulation of DNA binding activity, but TR-T4 and TR-T3 complexes exhibit different mobilities, underscoring the idea that TR-T4 complexes adopt a different structure from TR-T3 complexes in solution (see Fig. 2). T4Behaves as a TR Agonist in Cell Culture—We next examined the behavior of T4 in cell culture. T4 elicited a similar maximal response to T3 in cultured chinese hamster ovary cells that were stably transfected with a TH-regulated reporter gene and a vector that expresses either TRα (TRAFα cells, Fig. 5A) or TRβ (TRAFβ cells, Fig. 5B) (22Baxter J.D. Goede P. Apriletti J.W. West B.L. Feng W. Mellstrom K. Fletterick R.J. Wagner R.L. Kushner P.J. Ribeiro R.C.J. Webb P. Scanlan T.S. Nilsson S.

It is unlikely that T4 to T3 conversion accounts for the activity of administered T4 in these conditions for several reasons. Treatment of TRAF cells with optimal doses of the deiodinase inhibitors iopanoic acid or propylthiouracil (PTU) did not alter the T3 or T4 dose response, and we did not detect significant T4 to T3 conversion assayed by high performance liquid chromatography of TRAF cell extracts (not shown). Moreover, spiking T4 preparations with T3 (to account for 10% of total TH on a molar basis) yielded a leftward shift in EC50 relative to T4 alone (Fig. 5C), suggesting that T4 to T3 conversion of 10% (and probably lower) can be detected in this system. Thus, T4 behaves as a full agonist in cells in conditions in which conversion to T3 is unlikely to contribute significantly to agonist activity. The X-ray Crystal Structure of the TRβ-T4Complex Reveals That the LBD Adapts to the 5′-Iodine of T4and Completes the Coactivator Binding Surface—To determine how TRs accommodate T4 within the ligand binding pocket and perceive the compound as an agonist despite the presence of the bulky 5′ iodine group, we obtained structures of the TRβ-LBD in complex with T3 and T4. Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table I. A ribbon diagram of the T4-liganded TRβ structure (pink), superimposed over the T3-liganded TRβ structure (cyan) is shown in Fig. 6. The complexes are similar in overall fold, both to each other and to previously determined structures of TR LBDs bound to agonists. Moreover, T4 is completely buried within the core of the LBD, just like other agonists. The TRβ-T3 structure has a pocket volume of 572 Å3, whereas the TRβ-T4 structure exhibits a pocket volume of 607 Å3, as determined by GRASP (33Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). The TRβ-T3 and TRβ-T4 structures share the same space group and crystal contacts. Thus, differences in pocket volume between these two structures are probably attributable to the difference in the size of the ligand.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsT3T4Data CollectionSpacegroupP3121P3121Cell dimensionsa, b (Å)68.76468.790c (Å)130.943130.400Resolution (Å)2.53.1Reflections109,84827,682Unique Reflections12,9036,881Completeness99.7%99.4%Rsym (overall)0.080.07Rsym (highest resolution shell)0.350.31RefinementR working18.3821.96R free24.3226.12R.m.s. bond length (Å)0.0310.040R.m.s. bond angle (°)2.3102.780 Open table in a new tab Direct comparisons of the TR-T4 and TR-T3 complexes (using “blinking” between aligned LBD structures in Insight II (Accelrys)) revealed concerted backbone shifts in four distinct regions.

HRGPs are extended macromolecules consisting of small repetitive peptide and glycopeptide motifs that form peptide modules and glycomodules of functional significance, as in “mix-and-match” mode they define the molecular properties of the overall macromolecule. The glycomodules result from a combination of post-translational modifications unique to plants, namely proline hydroxylation (11Lamport D.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1438-1440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its subsequent glycosylation (12Lamport D.T.A. Nature. 1967; 216: 1322-1324Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that leads either to short arabino-oligosaccharide or larger arabinogalactan polysaccharide addition to the Hyp residues. A sequence-dependent O-Hyp glycosylation code directs the addition of oligosaccharide and polysaccharides (13Kieliszewski M.J. Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and it is likely that other sequence-dependent codes direct serine O-galactosylation and inter- and intramolecular covalent cross-linking of HRGPs. Cross-linked HRGPs, most notably extensins, contribute to wall architecture and defense responses by forming interpenetrating cross-linked networks in the wall; however, the precise identity of the intermolecular cross-link or cross-links has remained elusive. Three major types of monomeric extensin precursors to the insoluble extensin wall network are widespread in the dicots (14Showalter A.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 15Smith J.J. Muldoon E.P. Willard J.J. Lamport D.T.A. Phytochemistry. 1986; 25: 1021-1030Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) as follows: the P1-type (precursor 1) extensins that are characterized by the repetitive motif Ser-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Thr-Hyp-Val-Tyr-Lys; the P2-type (precursor 2) extensins that contain repeats of the motif Ser-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Val-Tyr-Lys-Tyr-Lys; and finally the P3 (precursor 3)-type extensins that contain variations of the repeat Ser-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Ser-Hyp-Ser-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Tyr-Tyr-Tyr-Lys (15Smith J.J. Muldoon E.P. Willard J.J. Lamport D.T.A. Phytochemistry. 1986; 25: 1021-1030Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition to intermolecular cross-linking, both P2 and P3 type extensins undergo intramolecular cross-linking of Tyr residues within the cross-linking module Tyr-X-Tyr (underlined in the sequences above) (1Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 16Epstein L. Lamport D.T.A. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 1241-1246Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar) to form the diphenyl ether cross-linking amino acid, isodityrosine (IDT) (17Fry S.C. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). IDT, first observed as an unknown tyrosine derivative in extensin peptides (18Lamport D.T.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and identified in cell wall hydrolysates (17Fry S.C. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), was initially assumed to be an intermolecular cross-link responsible for transforming the soluble extensin monomeric precursors, P1, P2, and P3, into an insoluble extensin network in muro (17Fry S.C. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 19Lamport, D. T. A., and Epstein, L. (1983) in Proceedings of the Annals of Plant Biochemistry and Physiology Symposium (Randall, D. D., Blevins, D. G., Larson, R. L., Rapp, B. J., Pallardy, S. G., Nelson, C. J., Polacco, J. C., and George, M. F., eds) Vol. 2, pp. 73–83, University of Missouri, Columbia, MOGoogle Scholar). But IDT was identified only as an intramolecular cross-link in P2- and P3-derived extensin peptides purified from enzymic digests of cell walls (16Epstein L. Lamport D.T.A. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 1241-1246Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, extensin peptides cross-linked by intermolecular IDT have never been isolated. Indeed, Lamport and co-workers (20Schnabelrauch L.S. Kieliszewski M.J. Upham B.L. Alizedeh H. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1996; 9: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) found no IDT in extensin P1 after cross-linkage in vitro by the pI 4.6 extensin peroxidase, although the abundance of Val-Tyr-Lys motifs in several cross-linking extensins, including P1, suggested intermolecular cross-links involving tyrosine and/or lysine (20Schnabelrauch L.S. Kieliszewski M.J. Upham B.L. Alizedeh H. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1996; 9: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). More recently, Fry and co-workers (21Brady J.D. Sadler I.H. Fry S.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Brady J.D. Sadler I.H. Fry S.C. Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) identified the tetrameric tyrosine derivative, di-isodityrosine (di-IDT), and the trimeric tyrosine derivative, pulcherosine, in wall hydrolysates. They speculated that IDT-containing extensins could be insolubilized into the cell wall network through intermolecular cross-linking of IDT and Tyr residues to form di-IDT and pulcherosine. This suggests a significant role in wall assembly and defense responses for IDT-rich extensins, which is supported by the recent discovery that RSH, an extensin containing 14 intramolecular IDT motifs, is crucially involved in positioning the cell plate during the earliest stages of embryogenesis in Arabidopsis (4Hall Q. Cannon M.C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, to date we lack direct demonstration of an extensin intermolecular cross-link. The results of extensin in vitro cross-linking assays have been difficult to interpret as the cross-linking substrates contained both Tyr and Lys in more than one type of repetitive motif, and the amino acids formed by cross-linking were not identified (20Schnabelrauch L.S. Kieliszewski M.J. Upham B.L. Alizedeh H. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1996; 9: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Everdeen D.S. Kiefer S. Willard J.J. Muldoon E.P. Dey P.M. Li X.-B.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Other approaches involving the isolation of intermolecularly cross-linked peptides from the cell wall itself have also proven intractable. To simplify the results of in vitro cross-linking assays and to test for the involvement of Tyr and Lys in cross-linking, we created a series of extensin mutants using a synthetic gene approach, described earlier (25Shpak E. Leykam J. Kieliszewksi M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Shpak E. Barbar E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). P3-type extensin was of particular interest because it is the most widespread extensin in the plant kingdom and therefore functionally significant, although frustratingly recalcitrant to isolation as a soluble monomeric precursor of network extensin; furthermore, its major repetitive motif possesses Tyr and Lys and a repetitive intramolecular IDT motif. The synthetic gene approach allowed us to explore the roles of IDT, Tyr, and Lys in cross-linking through the design of a series of simple synthetic genes, one encoding 20 and the other 8 repeats of the P3 repetitive motif: Ser-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Ser-Hyp-Ser-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Tyr-Tyr-Tyr-Lys, as well as variants containing Tyr → Phe and Lys → Leu mutations. Expression of these genes as enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion proteins in Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum) yielded secreted transgenic extensins in bulk for biochemical characterization and in vitro cross-linking reactions. They were glycosylated as predicted by the Hyp contiguity hypothesis and contained IDT similar to native P3-type extensins. Furthermore, the pI 4.6 extensin peroxidase characterized earlier (EC 1.11.1.7) (20Schnabelrauch L.S. Kieliszewski M.J. Upham B.L. Alizedeh H. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1996; 9: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) catalyzed intermolecular cross-linking only between those P3 extensin analogs which contained Tyr and formed the intermolecular cross-link, di-IDT. Synthesis of Plasmid pBI121-SStob-FK9-EGFP—Gene synthesis of the P3 extensin analog, FK, encoding repeats of the consensus sequence SPPPPSPSPPPPFFFK (supplemental Fig. 8A) was accomplished through a modified version of the head-to-tail method described earlier by using oligonucleotide primers and 5′- and 3′-DNA linkers (25Shpak E.

Polymerized FK synthetic gene constructs of variable lengths were subcloned into pUC18 as BamHI-EcoRI fragments to form plasmids pUC18-(FK)n. Plasmids were screened for insert size by XmaI-NcoI restriction followed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. A plasmid harboring 9 internal repeats of FK (pUC18-FK9) was selected and sequenced to verify reading frame integrity. The FK9 synthetic gene was then subcloned between a tobacco extensin signal sequence (SStob) (29De Loose M. Gheysen G. Tire C. Gielen J. Villarroel R. Genetello C. Van Montagu M. Depicker A. Inze D. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the EGFP gene (Clontech) in vector pUC18 as an XmaI-NcoI fragment to form pUC18-SStob-FK9-EGFP. The SStob-FK9-EGFP gene was subcloned as a BamHI-SacI fragment into the binary plant transformation vector pBI121 (30Bevan M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8711-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar) in place of the β-glucuronidase reporter gene to form the plasmid pBI121-SStob-FK9-EGFP. All primers were designed using Primer Premier software (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA) and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Synthesis of pBI121-SStob-YK20-EGFP, pBI121-SStob-YK8-EGFP, and pBI121-SStob-YL8-EGFP—Gene synthesis of tomato P3 extensin analogs encoding repeats of the consensus sequences SPPPPSPSPPPPYYYK (YK) and SPPPPSPSPPPPYYYL (YL) was accomplished using a modified version of a method described earlier (31Lewis R.V. Hinman M. Kothakota S. Fournier M. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, mutually priming sense and antisense oligonucleotide pairs (supplemental Fig. 8, B and C) were heat-denatured (94 °C for 7 min) and then annealed (60 °C for 5 min and then 45 °C for 10 min). Primer extension with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Promega, Madison, WI) followed by Sephacryl S-200 microspin column purification (Amersham Biosciences) yielded double-stranded YK and YL DNA constructs (supplemental Fig. 9). Constructs YK and YL were each digested with the restriction enzymes XmaI and SacI, followed by Sephacryl S-400 microspin column purification (Amersham Biosciences). The YK and YL XmaI-SacI fragments were subcloned into pUC18 forming the plasmids pUC18-YK and pUC18-YL. We verified the sequences by DNA sequence analysis. The unique BbsI and BsmFI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) restriction sites in YL and YK were used to create larger genes, as depicted in the flow chart (supplemental Fig. 9). Nonregenerable, complementary sticky ends were produced by separate BsmFI-ScaI and BbsI-ScaI restrictions of plasmid preparations harboring one repeat of the synthetic genes. Ligation of the insert containing the BsmFI-ScaI fragment with the insert containing the BbsI-ScaI fragment produced plasmids possessing two repeats designated pUC18-YK2 and pUC18-YL2, respectively. This process was repeated to create plasmids of 8 and 20 internal repeats (pUC18-YK20, pUC18-YK8, and pUC18-YL8). Polymerized YK20, YK8, and YL8 inserts were then ligated between SStob and EGFP as described above for FK9 to form plasmids pUC18-SStob-YK20-EGFP, pUC18-SStob-YK8-EGFP, and pUC18-SStob-YL8-EGFP. These genes were also subcloned into pBI121 as BamHI-SacI fragments forming the plasmids pBI121-SStob-YK20-EGFP, pBI121-SStob-YK8-EGFP, and pBI121-SStob-YL8-EGFP. Agrobacterium Transformation and Selection of Cell Lines—Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain LBA4404) was transformed with pBI121-SStob-FK9-EGFP, pBI121-SStob-YK20-EGFP, pBI121 SStob-YK8-EGFP, and pBI12-SStob-YL8-EGFP by the freeze-thaw method (32An G.

Fluorescence microscopy was used to aid in the detection and selection of cell lines expressing the EGFP reporter protein (data not shown), also described previously (25Shpak E. Leykam J. Kieliszewksi M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Maintenance—Modified SH medium with kanamycin (150 μgml–1) was used for the propagation of cell lines in both liquid and solid cultures. Liquid cultures (500 ml) were grown in 1-liter flasks on New Brunswick gyratory shakers at 88–94 rpm at ambient temperatures. Medium Collection from Transgenic BY2 Tobacco Cells—Spent culture medium from transformed cells lines was concentrated by rotary evaporation and then dialyzed against distilled, deionized water at 4 °C. Fractionation of the Concentrated Medium by Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography—Concentrated medium was adjusted to 2 m sodium chloride and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were loaded onto a butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) column (inner diameter, 1.6 × 40 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 2 m aqueous sodium chloride. Elution proceeded stepwise using first 2 m aqueous sodium chloride, then 1 m aqueous sodium chloride, and finally distilled-deionized water. Visibly green fractions eluted in water were collected, dialyzed against distilled, deionized water for 36 h at 4 °C, and then lyophilized. The corresponding fractions were designated YK20-EGFP, YK8-EGFP, YL8-EGFP, and FK9-EGFP. Fractionation of YK20-EGFP, YK8-EGFP, YL8-EGFP, and FK9-EGFP by Gel Permeation Chromatography—The green fluorescent peaks from HIC were dissolved at 30 mg ml–1 in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 0.005% (w/v) sodium azide (Superose buffer) and further fractionated by gel permeation chromatography on either a preparative Superose-12 or a preparative Superose-6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Superose buffer. Eluates (flow rate, 0.5–1 ml min–1) were monitored at 220 nm and by eye for green color. Purification of YK20-EGFP, YK8-EGFP, YL8-EGFP, and FK9-EGFP by Reversed-phase HPLC—Fractions from gel permeation chromatography were injected directly onto a semi-preparative C4 reversed-phase HPLC column (inner diameter, 1 × 25 cm, Vydac, Hesperia, CA), equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with a 60-min linear gradient of 0–100% end buffer (0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, v/v, in 80% acetonitrile, v/v) at a flow rate of 2 ml min–1. Spectrophotometric detection was at 220 nm. Neutral Sugar Analyses—The neutral sugar compositions of YK20-EGFP, YK8-EGFP, YL8-EGFP, and FK9-EGFP (100 μg each) were determined as alditol acetate derivatives (34Albersheim P. Nevins D.J. English P.D. Karr A. Carbohydr. Res. 1967; 5: 340-345Crossref Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography was performed on an HP-5890 Series II GC using an HP-5 column (cross-linked 5% PH ME Siloxane; inner diameter 30 m × 0.32 mm; 0.25-μm film thickness; Hewlett-Packard) programmed from 130 to 177 °C at a rate of 1.2 °C min–1 and then from 177 to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C min–1. Hyp-O-Glycosylation Profiles—YK20-EGFP (2.20 mg), YK8-EGFP (4.10 mg), YL8-EGFP (2.25 mg), and FK9-EGFP (2.21 mg) were each dissolved at 5 mg ml–1 in 0.44 n aqueous sodium hydroxide and hydrolyzed at 105 °C for 18 h. Samples were cooled on ice, neutralized with ice-cold 1 m aqueous sulfuric acid, and then lyophilized. Hyp-glycoside profiles were determined as described earlier (25Shpak E. Leykam J. Kieliszewksi M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 35Lamport D.T.A. Miller D.H. Plant Physiol. 1971; 48: 454-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptic Digestion to Remove EGFP—The isolated fusion glycoproteins (5–100 mg) were each dissolved in water to 28.6 mg ml–1 and heated to 100 °C for 2–3 min. Once cool, samples were diluted to 5 mg ml–1 in 2% (w/v) ammonium bicarbonate containing 10 mm calcium chloride. Trypsin was added at a substrate to enzyme ratio of 100:1 (w/w), and reaction mixtures were incubated 16–24 h at room temperature with constant stirring. The reaction products were lyophilized and then fractionated by gel permeation chromatography on a preparative Superose-12 column followed by semi-preparative C4 reversed-phase HPLC using the same buffers and gradients as described above. Peaks corresponding to the YK20, YK8, YL8, and FK9 glycoproteins were collected and lyophilized. The purified glycoproteins, without EGFP, were used for amino acid composition analyses, IDT and di-IDT assays, and as substrates for in vitro cross-linking assays. Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) Deglycosylation—YK20-EGFP (9.3 mg), YK8-EGFP (8.6 mg), YL8-EGFP (8.2 mg), and YK20XL (7.5 mg) were treated with HF (36Sanger M.P. Lamport D.T.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) resulting in the deglycosylated fusion proteins dYK20-EGFP, dYK8-EGFP, dYL8-EGFP, and dYK20XL, respectively. The HF was removed from the deglycosylated products by dialysis against water, except for YK20XL. Instead, the HF was removed from YK20XL by evaporation under nitrogen followed by a water wash (repeated once). The insoluble product was again suspended in water and then lyophilized. The deglycosylated, lyophilized YK20XL pellet (2.32 mg) was then hydrolyzed for further characterization by amino acid analysis and IDT/di-IDT assays. Amino Acid Composition Analysis and N-terminal Sequencing—The amino acid compositions of YK20, YK8, YL8, and YK20XL were determined as described earlier (37Bergman T. Carlquist M. Jornvall H. Wittman-Liebold B. Advanced Methods in Protein Microsequence Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 45-55Crossref Google Scholar). FK9 was sent to the Michigan State University Macromolecular Facility for amino acid composition analyses. Because of the extreme hydrophobicity of the phenylisothiocyanate derivatives of IDT and di-IDT, the two amino acids were quantified in hydrolysates after fractionation by gel permeation chromatography (described below). The fusion glycoprotein FK9-EGFP and fusion proteins dYK20-EGFP, dYK8-EGFP, and dYL8-EGFP were sent to the Michigan State University Macromolecular Facility for N-terminal sequence analysis. Quantitation of IDT and di-IDT in YK20, YK8, YL8, FK9, and YK20XL—The YK20, YK8, YL8, and FK9 glycomodules and YK20XL were analyzed for the presence of IDT and di-IDT by an assay described earlier (20Schnabelrauch L.S. Kieliszewski M.J. Upham B.L. Alizedeh H. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1996; 9: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). YK20, YK8, YL8, and FK9 (1 mg each) and YK20XL (2.2 mg) were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl (aqueous) with 10 mm phenol (2 mg ml–1; 110 °C; 20 h). Hydrolysates were dried under a steady stream of nitrogen (gas) and then redissolved at 10 mg ml–1 in water. The hydrolysates were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography on a polyhydroxyethyl A column (inner diameter, 9.4 × 200 mm, 10 nm pore size, Poly LC Inc., Columbia, MD) equilibrated in 50 mm formic acid and eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 0.8 ml min–1. UV absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. The amounts of IDT and di-IDT in the hydrolysates were determined by comparison with authentic IDT and di-IDT standards. Response factors were determined from three level calibrations with the IDT and di-IDT standards. The IDT standard was a gift from Professor Derek T. A. Lamport, University of Sussex, and the di-IDT standard was a gift from Professor Stephen Fry, University of Edinburgh. Isolation of Tomato P1 Extensin—Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) P1 was isolated from Bonnie Best cell suspension culture medium by cation exchange chromatography as described earlier (15Smith J.J. Muldoon E.P. Willard J.J. Lamport D.T.A. Phytochemistry. 1986; 25: 1021-1030Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In Vitro Cross-linking of P1 Extensin and P3 Extensin Analogs by Tomato pI 4.6 Extensin Peroxidase—The pI 4.6 extensin peroxidase fraction was isolated from the culture medium of tomato cell suspension cultures by a single step of DEAE-anion exchange chromatography (20Schnabelrauch L.S. Kieliszewski M.J. Upham B.L. Alizedeh H. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1996; 9: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and used for the cross-linking assays. The basic extensin peroxidase characterized earlier from tomato cell walls was also isolated by salt elution of the cells as described by Everdeen et al. (23Everdeen D.S. Kiefer S. Willard J.J. Muldoon E.P. Dey P.M. Li X.-B. Lamport D. T. A Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 616-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxidase activity was quantified by 2,2-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline) sulfonic acid assay (20Schnabelrauch L.S. Kieliszewski M.J. Upham B.L. Alizedeh H. Lamport D.T.A.

Chem. 1979; 254: 872-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated YK20, YK8, YL8, and FK9 and native tomato P1 extensin were used as substrates for in vitro cross-linking reactions. The assay involved addition in the following order: 10 μl of extensin substrate (6 mg ml–1 in pH 6, 150 mm McIlvaine buffer), 5 μl of 240 μm hydrogen peroxide (freshly prepared), 5 μl of enzyme in sodium acetate buffer (1 ng of enzyme, either the pI 4.6 peroxidase or the basic peroxidase). Cross-linking reactions (20 μl final volume) were performed at room temperature as described earlier (20Schnabelrauch L.S. Kieliszewski M.J. Upham B.L. Alizedeh H. Lamport D.T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2063416091,"Cox17 is a 69-residue cysteine-rich, copper-binding protein that has been implicated in the delivery of copper to the CuA and CuB centers of cytochrome c oxidase via the copper-binding proteins Sco1 and Cox11, respectively. According to isothermal titration calorimetry experiments, fully reduced Cox17 binds one Cu(I) ion with a Ka of (6.15 ± 5.83) × 106m-1. The solution structures of both apo and Cu(I)-loaded Cox17 reveal two α helices preceded by an extensive, unstructured N-terminal region. This region is reminiscent of intrinsically unfolded proteins. The two structures are very similar overall with residues in the copper-binding region becoming more ordered in Cu(I)-loaded Cox17. Based on the NMR data, the Cu(I) ion has been modeled as two-coordinate with ligation by conserved residues Cys23 and Cys26. This site is similar to those observed for the Atx1 family of copper chaperones and is consistent with reported mutagenesis studies. A number of conserved, positively charged residues may interact with complementary surfaces on Sco1 and Cox11, facilitating docking and copper transfer. Taken together, these data suggest that Cox17 is not only well suited to a copper chaperone function but is specifically designed to interact with two different target proteins.

Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). CcO is a multisubunit complex located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Mammalian CcO comprises 13 subunits, of which 10 are nuclearly encoded and three are encoded by the mitochondrial genome. These three mitochondrial subunits, Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3, contain several essential cofactors (2Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). In the catalytic cycle, reduced cytochrome c transfers electrons to a dinuclear copper center, the CuA site, in Cox2. Electrons are then passed to a heme A cofactor in Cox1 and finally to the heterometallic heme A-CuB dioxygen-binding site in Cox1. Assembly of CcO is a complicated process involving import of the nuclearly encoded subunits to the mitochondrion, synthesis and incorporation of the two heme A groups, and delivery and insertion of the three copper ions (3Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the latter process is important for understanding copper trafficking, especially in the context of recent research linking human diseases to deficiencies in copper metabolism (4Llanos R.M. Mercer J.F.B. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 5Hamza I. Gitlin J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, formation of complex multinuclear copper cofactors such as CuA or the nitrous oxide reductase tetranuclear CuZ site (6Brown K.R. Djinovic-Carugo K. Haltia T. Cabrito I. Saraste M.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), have been implicated in loading of the CcO copper centers. Sco1 is involved in the assembly of the dinuclear CuA site (9Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol.

Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Both receive copper directly from Cox17 (12Horng Y-C. Cobine P.A. Maxfield A.B. Carr H.S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35334-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). First identified in yeast, these proteins are highly conserved in other eukaryotes (13Elam J.S. Thomas S.T. Holloway S.P. Taylor A.B. Hart P.J. Adv. Prot. Chem. 2002; 60: 151-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Yeast Cox17 is a 69-residue protein localized to both the cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane space (14Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Yeast Sco1 is a 295-residue inner mitochondrial membrane protein comprising an N-terminal transmembrane segment and a C-terminal soluble domain (8Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Yeast Cox11 is a 300-residue inner mitochondrial membrane protein, also composed of an N-terminal transmembrane segment and a C-terminal soluble domain (9Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cox17 was originally proposed to shuttle copper between the cytosol and Sco1 (14Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that Cox17 tethered to the inner mitochondrial membrane is fully functional, however (15Maxfield A.B. Heaton D.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, mitochondrial copper levels are independent of the presence of Cox17 (16Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These results suggest that trafficking copper ions between the cytosol and the mitochondrial intermembrane space is not a function of Cox17. Consistent with a role in CuA loading, some mutations in Cox17 lead to very low Cox2 levels (17Punter F.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30875-30880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although stable complexes between Cox17 and Sco1 or between Sco1 and Cox2 have not yet been reported, interactions between Sco1 and Cox2 have been detected by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation experiments (18Lode A. Kuschel M. Paret C. Rödel G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that metal transfer via transient complex formation is possible.The copper binding properties of Cox17, Sco1, and Cox11 have been studied by spectroscopy and mutagenesis. Stoichiometries of two (14Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or three (19Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) Cu(I) ions/recombinant yeast Cox17 monomer have been reported. Cox17 isolated directly from porcine intestine reportedly contains four Cu(I) ions (20Palumaa P. Kangur L. Voronova A. Sillard R. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). According to optical, luminescence (20Palumaa P. Kangur L. Voronova A. Sillard R. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) spectroscopic studies, Cox17 loaded with three or four copper ions contains a polynuclear cluster. Mutagenesis studies on yeast Cox17 indicate that three of seven cysteines, of which six are conserved, are required to produce active cytochrome c oxidase. These cysteines, Cys23, Cys24, and Cys26, are found in a CCXC motif and are proposed to coordinate copper (19Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The ∼200-residue C-terminal soluble domain of Sco1 binds one Cu(I) ion (22Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22185-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data indicate the presence of one nitrogen and two sulfur ligands. These ligands include two cysteines in a conserved CXXXC motif and a conserved histidine. Mutation of any one of these three residues abolishes copper binding by Sco1 and results in nonfunctional cytochrome c oxidase (22Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The solution structure of apo Sco1 from Bacillus subtilis reveals that these ligands are derived from two flexible loop regions (24Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Structure. 2003; 11: 1431-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The C-terminal soluble domain of Cox11 is a dimer and binds one Cu(I) ion/monomer. EXAFS data indicate the presence of a dinuclear cluster with each Cu(I) ion ligated by three sulfurs (10Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 25Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Gonnelli L. Mangani S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34833-34839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The solution structure of dimeric Cu(I)-loaded Cox11 from Sinorhizobium meliloti suggests that two ligands derive from a CXC motif located on the side of an immunoglobulin-like β barrel structure, with the third ligand donated by the same CXC motif in the second monomer (25Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Gonnelli L. Mangani S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34833-34839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).In contrast to Sco1 and Cox11, no structural data are available for Cox17. To understand the function of Cox17, knowledge of its three-dimensional structure and clarification of its copper binding stoichiometry are required. In particular, it is not known how Cox17 can recognize and interact with both Sco1 and Cox11, which have very different structures from one another (24Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Structure. 2003; 11: 1431-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Gonnelli L. Mangani S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34833-34839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is also unclear how copper might be transferred from a polynuclear cluster in Cox17 to the mononuclear site in Sco1 or to the dinuclear site in Cox11 and subsequently to the dinuclear CuA center or the mononuclear CuB center. To address these issues, we have determined the solution structures of both the apo (apoCox17) and Cu(I)-loaded (CuCox17) forms of Cox17. In addition, we have used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the association constant (Ka) and stoichiometry (n) of Cu(I) binding to Cox17.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Cloning and Expression—Cox17 was cloned from yeast genomic DNA by PCR. The forward primer (5′-GGAATTCCATATGACTGAAACTGACAAGAAACAAGAACAAGAAAACC-3′) was designed to include a 5′ NdeI restriction enzyme site, and the reverse primer (5′-CGGGATCCCTAATTTGCACTTGGAACTTCGAAGC-3′) was designed to include a 3′ BamHI site. The PCR product was digested with NdeI/BamHI and inserted into the pET3a vector (Novagen). The resultant plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3)-pLysS cells. Protein for ITC measurements was expressed in cells grown in LB medium at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of ∼1.2, and the cells were harvested after 3 h. Protein for NMR structural characterization was expressed in cells grown at 37 °C in minimal medium containing 13 g/liter KH2PO4, 10 g/liter K2HPO4, 9 g/liter Na2HPO4, 2.4 g/liter K2SO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1× BME vitamin solution (Sigma), 1.5 g/liter 15N-ammonium chloride (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.), and 4 g/liter 13C-d-glucose (Sigma). Protein expression was induced using 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of ∼1.1, and the cells were harvested 3 h thereafter.Protein Purification—The cells were lysed by freeze-thawing three times. Approximately 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mm tris(2-carboxylethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (buffer A)/liter of harvested cells was added to the lysed cells. DNase I (∼5 μg/ml) was then added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20–30 min. The lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 125,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. After overnight dialysis against buffer A at 4 °C, the cell extract was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a 7.5 column volume 0–0.15 m KCl gradient. Following overnight dialysis against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mm TCEP (buffer B), the sample was loaded onto a Bio-Scale CHT-I hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The protein was eluted with a 10 column volume 0.1–0.16 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, gradient, concentrated, and further purified on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The purified Cox17 was then dialyzed into 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0. for storage at -80 °C. The identity of the protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Protein Sciences Facility, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Both inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy using a Thermo Jarrell Ash Atomscan model 25 sequential inductively coupled plasma spectrometer and atomic absorption spectroscopy using a PerkinElmer AAnalyst 700 indicate that Cox17 purified by this procedure contains no detectable copper ions.NMR Sample Preparation—A 1 mm sample of purified Cox17 was first reduced by direct addition of 1 m TCEP to a final concentration of 1 mm. The sample was then dialyzed three times versus 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1 mm TCEP and transferred to a room temperature Coy anaerobic chamber for three more cycles of dialysis versus 20 mm degassed potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, to remove the TCEP. The final concentration of TCEP was estimated to be in the picomolar range. After the addition of D2O to a final concentration of ∼7% v/v, the sample was sealed inside a gas tight NMR tube (Wilmad) and removed from the chamber. Copper-loaded samples were prepared by dialyzing the samples into 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl during the final anaerobic dialysis cycle and then titrating in an anaerobic solution of 6.1 mm CuCl in 1 m NaCl and 10 mm HCl. 1H-15N HSQC and aromatic 1H-13C HSQC spectra were used to determine the end point of the titration. Samples in ∼99% D2O were prepared by lyophilizing the purified protein, reconstituting in 99.99% D2O (Aldrich) inside the anaerobic chamber and sealing in a gas tight NMR tube.NMR Spectroscopy—All of the NMR data were acquired at 25 °C on a Varian 600 MHz Inova NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance, xyz gradient probe. Resonance assignments were determined using standard double and triple resonance, two- and three-dimensional protein NMR experiments (26Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 27Sattler M. Schleucher J. Greisinger C. Prog. Nucl. Mag. Res. Sp. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional HNCACB, CBCA-CONH, HNCO, C(CO)NH-TOCSY (mixing time = 12 ms), and 15N-edited NOESY (mixing time = 100 ms) experiments were acquired for samples in 95% H2O, 5% D2O. 13C-edited NOESY (mixing time = 100 ms) and HCCH-COSY experiments were acquired for samples in ∼99% D2O. Two-dimensional 13C-CT-HSQC, (HB)CB(CGCD)HD, and (HB)CB(CGCD-CE)HE experiments were also acquired to assign the resonances of the aromatic side chains. Two-dimensional 1H-15N NOE experiments were recorded in triplicate to assess backbone flexibility. H(CCO)NH-TOCSY and 15N-TOCSY (mixing time = 100 ms) experiments were additionally acquired for the apoCox17 sample, and an HCCH-TOCSY experiment was additionally acquired for the CuCox17 sample. All of the NMR data processing and analysis was performed using Felix2000 software with a customized menu-driven interface.NMR Structure Calculations—The structures were calculated with ARIA (version 1.2) in combination with CNS (28Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). NOE restraints were obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY and three-dimensional aliphatic 13C-edited NOESY spectra. NOEs were calibrated and assigned iteratively and automatically by ARIA and were checked manually throughout the refinement. A total of 27 phi and psi torsion angle restraints for apoCox17 and 25 phi and psi torsion angle restraints for CuCox17 were derived from an analysis of Hα,Cα,Cβ,C′, and backbone 15N chemical shifts using TALOS (30Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). The torsion angle restraint bounds were set to three times the standard deviation of the predicted TALOS values. Hydrogen bonding distance restraints were applied only for the helical regions predicted by TALOS. Extended backbone conformations were used as the starting models for the structure calculations. The default settings in the ARIA run.cns task file were used for the structure calculations except for the following parameters. The number of steps in the simulated annealing protocol was doubled for improved convergence, and the final force constants for the distance and torsion angle restraints were set to 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2 and 100 kcal mol-1 rad-2, respectively. Eighty structures were computed in the final iteration, of which 20 were chosen for further analysis.In addition, four possible copper binding schemes were modeled: a three-coordinate Cu(I) ion ligated by Cys23, Cys24, and Cys26, and three two-coordinate models with ligation by Cys23 and Cys24, by Cys23 and Cys26, and by Cys24 and Cys26. The copper ion was modeled by appending it onto the protein sequence as an additional amino acid. Copper-sulfur bond restraints of 2.275 ± 0.05 and 2.159 ± 0.025 Å were applied to the three-coordinate and two-coordinate models, respectively. Cartesian molecular dynamics were employed for the structure calculations in which a Cu(I) ion was modeled. For apoCox17, CuCox17, and the four Cu(I)-bound models, the 20 structures determined to possess the lowest restraint energies, restraint violations, and root mean square deviations (rmsd) from ideal covalent geometry were chosen for further analysis. The structures were analyzed with PROCHECK-NMR (31Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar), and the figures were generated with MOLSCRIPT (32Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (33Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar).ITC Measurements—ITC experiments were performed using procedures similar to those described previously for Atox1 and the Wilson disease protein (34Wernimont A.K. Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12269-12276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Stock protein solutions of 100 μm Cox17 in 3 ml of chelexed 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl (buffer M) were incubated for 30 min on ice with 10 mm EDTA and either 1 mm TCEP or 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The EDTA was then removed by two rounds of dialysis versus 500 ml of buffer M supplemented with either 1 mm TCEP or 100 mm DTT at 4 °C. At this point, the concentration of EDTA was estimated to be ∼0.36 μm. The protein sample was then transferred to a room temperature Coy anaerobic chamber and dialyzed three times versus 500 ml of buffer M. The final concentrations of TCEP and DTT were estimated to be ∼0.21 and ∼21 nm, respectively. After this treatment, the residual copper content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences AAnalyst 700 (detection limit for copper, 1.5 ppb). A standard curve was generated using a copper atomic absorption standard (Aldrich) diluted to 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 ppm. All of the samples and buffer M were found to contain ∼25 ppb residual copper. A stock solution of 6.1 mm CuCl in 10 mm HCl and 1.0 m NaCl was prepared, and its concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopic analysis by Galbraith Laboratories (Knoxville, TN). Both protein and copper solutions were diluted with buffer M immediately before the ITC runs to 5–25 and 200–600 μm, respectively. The concentrations of the diluted Cox17 samples were determined using the Enhanced BCA protein assay (Pierce).Protein samples were removed from the anaerobic chamber in a 2.5-ml Hamilton gas tight syringe and loaded into the calorimeter (MicroCal) sample cell under a constant pool of high grade pure argon. The Cu(I) solution was loaded into a 250-μl titration syringe in the anaerobic chamber and transferred to the calorimeter chamber under argon gas. For each experiment, an automated sequence of 20–30 injections of 5–10 μl of Cu(I) were applied to the protein in the sample cell with a 3–6-min pause between injections to allow for equilibration. The reaction solution was stirred at 400 rpm, and the temperature of the chamber was maintained at 25 °C working against a surrounding water bath temperature of 15 °C. All of the experiments were repeated at least three times with the same settings. The data were analyzed with the Origin 5.0 software package provided by MicroCal using a one-site binding model. A background correction was applied to each experiment, corresponding to the average of the last four injections and was consistent with a control experiment in which the Cu(I) solution was titrated into buffer alone. After subtraction of this heat of dilution, a nonlinear least squares method was used to obtain the best fit parameters for the number of binding sites, n, the association constant, Ka, and the change in enthalpy ΔH°. Two negative control experiments were used to address the specificity of copper binding (34Wernimont A.K. Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12269-12276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). First, Mg(II) was titrated into 20 μm Cox17 using 300 μm MgCl2 prepared in 10 mm HCl and 1 m NaCl. Second, Cu(I) was titrated into a 20–35 μm solution of lysozyme (14,296 kDa; Research Organics). These control experiments were performed in triplicate under the same conditions used for the Cox17 experiments.Quantitation of Free Cysteines—The redox state of Cox17 was determined by alkylation of the free cysteine residues with 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) (Molecular Probes), a reagent specific for reduced thiols. Five samples were prepared to determine the number of reduced cysteines, the accessibility of free cysteines, the efficiency of reducing agents, and the stability of reduced Cox17 to air oxidation: 1) as-isolated, purified Cox17, 2) Cox17 reduced with 1 mm TCEP subsequently removed by anaerobic dialysis, 3) Cox17 in the presence of 1 mm TCEP, 4) Cox17 reduced with 100 mm DTT subsequently removed by anaerobic dialysis, and 5) same treatment as in 4) followed by exposure to air for 20 min prior to AMS modification. For each reaction, 60 μl of 25 mm AMS, 6.25% SDS in buffer M were added to 100 μl of ∼400 μm protein, yielding final concentrations of ∼250 μm Cox17, 10 mm AMS, and 2% SDS. The reactions were shielded from light with aluminum foil and incubated at room temperature with vigorous stirring in the anaerobic chamber. After 2 h, the samples were dialyzed into water and analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE on 15% Tris-glycine gels. For matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis (Mass Spectrometry Facility, University of Arizona and Protein Sciences Facility, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), the derivatized proteins were diluted five times and submitted for analysis without reaction termination or further purification. Each conjugated AMS moiety increases the protein molecular mass by 490 Da. The number of reduced cysteines was also measured by using Ellman's reagent and by a thiol and sulfide quantitation kit (Molecular Probes).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRedox State of Cox17—To evaluate the method of preparing reduced Cox17 for Cu(I) binding titrations and to determine the availability of the seven cysteines, AMS modification was used. On nonreducing SDS-PAGE, all of the modified samples migrated at substantially higher molecular masses than unmodified Cox17, but mass spectrometry was necessary to quantify accurately the number of conjugated AMS moieties. Mass spectrometric analysis of as-isolated, purified Cox17 subjected to AMS modification yielded a major peak at 7,914 Da corresponding to unmodified protein lacking the N-terminal methionine (predicted 7,925 Da) as well as a minor peak at 8,430 Da corresponding to the presence of one AMS moiety (predicted 8,418 Da), suggesting that one cysteine remains partly reduced under the purification conditions. Samples reduced with either 1 mm TCEP or 100 mm DTT followed by reductant removal by anaerobic dialysis contained a spectrum of modified products ranging from 3 to 7 AMS units. For both reductants, peaks at 9,398 and 11,369 Da, corresponding to Cox17 with 3 (predicted 9,403 Da) and 7 AMS (predicted 11,373 Da) units, respectively, were the most intense. These data indicate that 1 mm TCEP and 100 mm DTT yield seven free cysteines and are thus appropriate for generating reduced Cox17 for Cu(I) ITC experiments. The presence of species with less than seven AMS moieties is likely due to inefficient"
https://openalex.org/W2051395127,"The estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) is an orphan member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors involved in the control of energy metabolism. In particular, ERRα induces a high energy expenditure in the presence of the coactivator PGC-1α. However, ERRα knockout mice have reduced fat mass and are resistant to diet-induced obesity. ERRα is expressed in epithelial cells of the small intestine, and because the intestine is the first step in the energy chain, we investigated whether ERRα plays a function in dietary energy handling. Gene expression profiling in the intestine identified a subset of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation that were down-regulated in the absence of ERRα. In support of the physiological role of ERRα in this pathway, isolated enterocytes from ERRα knockout mice display lower capacity for β-oxidation. Microarray results also show altered expression of genes involved in dietary lipid digestion and absorption, such as pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (PLRP2), fatty acid-binding protein 1 and 2 (L-FABP and I-FABP), and apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV). In agreement, we found that ERRα–/– pups exhibit significant lipid malabsorption. We further show that the apoA-IV promoter is a direct target of ERRα and that its presence is required to maintain basal level but not feeding-induced regulation of the apoA-IV gene in mice. ERRα, in cooperation with PGC-1α, activates the apoA-IV promoter via interaction with the apoC-III enhancer in both human and mouse.

Nuclear receptors are ligand-inducible transcription factors that control important metabolic pathways needed for development and homeostasis. This superfamily includes classic receptors for ligands such as steroid hormones, vitamin D, and thyroid hormones as well as orphan nuclear receptors for which there are no physiological ligands associated at the time of their discovery (1Giguère V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) 1The abbreviations used are: ERR, estrogen-related receptor; apo, apolipoprotein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α coactivator 1α; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; Ab, antibody. is an orphan nuclear receptor originally identified on the basis of its homology with the estrogen receptor α (2Giguère V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The two receptors display transcriptional cross-talk and share some target genes and synthetic ligands (reviewed in Ref. 3Giguère V. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 220-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ERRα may have a function in bone remodeling (4Bonnelye E. Merdad L. Kung V. Aubin J.E. J.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4670-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), two classical estrogen-responsive tissues. Apart from its proposed role as a modulator of estrogen receptor-dependent pathways, several lines of evidence indicate that ERRα acts primarily as a regulator of energy metabolism. First, ERRα is known to be expressed in tissues with high β-oxidation activity such as the brown fat, kidney, heart, and intestine (2Giguère V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 8Vanacker J.M. Delmarre C. Guo X. Laudet V. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 1007-1014PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sladek R. Bader J.-A.

Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Second, ERRα regulates the gene encoding medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), which catalyzes the initial step in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (9Sladek R. Bader J.-A. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Vega R.B. Kelly D.P. J. Biol.

Third, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a coactivator central to the control of energy expenditure (15Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar), has recently been described as a key partner of ERRα, assuring both its expression and transactivation potential (10Kamei Y.

In fact, ERRα appears to be an essential transducer of PGC-1α action in mediating mitochondrial biogenesis (17Schreiber S.N. Emter R. Hock M.B. Knutti D. Cardenas J. Podvinec M. Oakeley E.J.

We recently observed that the absence of ERRα in knockout mice leads to reduced fat mass and resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity (19Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.-A. Richard D. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In addition, gene expression profiling experiments in adipose tissue from ERRα knockout mice revealed alterations in the expression of genes implicated in the regulation of adipogenesis and energy metabolism. However, we could not detect significant changes in dietary intake or energy expenditure between the wild-type and ERRα-deficient mice. Knowing that ERRα is expressed in the intestine, defective uptake or utilization of dietary nutrients in ERRα-deficient mice could also contribute to the observed lean phenotype. In fact, the intestine is the site essential for the transport of alimentary fat. After the digestive phase, the lipolytic products are absorbed by the enterocytes, in which a complex series of sequential events result in their packaging as chylomicrons. In addition, the intestine contributes to total body β-oxidation because of its large surface and specific needs (20Murase T. Aoki M. Wakisaka T. Hase T. Tokimitsu I. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1312-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we have addressed the functional role of ERRα in intestinal tissues, using the ERRα knockout mice model and the power of gene expression profiling. Our findings show that ERRα is involved in mitochondrial electron transport and intestinal lipid handling. In particular, ERRα interacts with the apolipoprotein (apo)C-III enhancer and specifically regulates the adjacent apoA-IV gene. Animals—ERRα–/– mice were generated as described (19Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.-A. Richard D. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Mice used were either into 129/SvJ or C57BL/6J genetic backgrounds. Animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facility of the McGill University Health Centre and were fed standard laboratory chow. Lipid Load—ERRα–/– and wild-type littermate adult mice were fasted overnight (18 h) followed by the administration of either normal saline or 200 μl of olive oil by oro-gastric gavage. Mice were sacrificed after 2 h, RNA was extracted from jejunal tissues and submitted to reverse transcription. cDNA samples were used as templates to measure mouse apoA-IV expression by quantitative RT-PCR. ApoA-IV gene expression levels were compared between mice fed saline versus olive oil as well as between ERRα–/– and wild-type mice. RNA in Situ Hybridization—Intestinal tissues from C57Bl/6J mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (7-μm thick) were processed for in situ hybridization according to published protocols with a 33P-labeled riboprobe obtained from the 3′-untranslated region of mouse ERRα (bp 1730–2027) (AS). Negative control was hybridized with a sense riboprobe (S). Western Immunoblots—Nuclear proteins were isolated from the digestive epithelium of mice by an adaptation of a previously described method (21Perreault N. Beaulieu J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were sacrificed, and the digestive tract was separated into sections of stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and proximal colon. Each segment was opened longitudinally and rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The segments were further cut in 5-mm long pieces and incubated in 5 ml of cold MatriSperse (BD Biosciences) at 4 °C for 18 h. The epithelial layer was dissociated by gentle manual shaking. The epithelial suspension was collected, centrifuged, and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear proteins were then isolated from the epithelial cell pellet as described previously (9Sladek R. Bader J.-A. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5400-5409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoblotted with ERRα polyclonal antiserum raised against the N terminus of mouse ERRα (19Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.-A. Richard D. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and anti-laminin B antibody (M20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The proteins were visualized with an ECL Western blotting detection system according to instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Preparation and Microarray—Total RNA from mouse intestinal tissues (ileum) were prepared with the RNeasy kit with DNase treatment on column (Qiagen). RNA from 3–4 mice of each genotype was pooled to compare gene expression in three experiments: in female of the C57Bl/6J background, in male of the C57Bl/6J background and in both male and female of the 129/SvJ genetic background. The mouse 6.5K microarray was used for gene expression profiling experiments. This chip is based on the Mouse Genome Oligo Set (70 mer) version 1.1 from Operon, printed by the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute Microarray Laboratory. Briefly, 2.5 μg of total RNA from ERRα–/– and ERRα+/+ mice intestinal tissues were indirectly labeled with either Cy3- or Cy5-reactive dyes followed by co-hybridization on Operon Slides (protocol at the following Web site: www.queensu.ca/microarray/). Each RNA pair was hybridized on 2 arrays employing a fluor reversal strategy such as the ERRα–/– sample was labeled with Cy3 for one hybridization and with Cy5 for the other hybridization. Chips were scanned using the ScanArray4000, and quantitation was done using the Quant-Array software (Version 3.0). After pixel intensity determination, background subtraction, and normalization, the relative expression levels for every gene were depicted as the logarithm of the ratio of intensity in ERRα–/– over ERRα+/+ samples. It was observed that logarithms of the ratio were distributed according to a Gaussian distribution, with mean and S.D. Genes having normalized ratio values outside of 2 S.D. were considered differentially expressed. Pertinent genes were defined as genes found to be differentially expressed in 4 of 6 microarray chip experiments. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—2.5 μg of total RNA from each of the 6 pooled RNA samples used for microarray were used to synthesize cDNA in 20 μl using Superscript II (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase and d(T)12–18 random hexamer primers (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA samples were used as templates, and real-time quantitative PCR was performed using LightCycler and Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green (Roche Applied Science). Intron-spanning specific primers were designed based on sequences from the Celera data base. The specificity of the PCR product was documented by LightCycler melting curve analysis and migration on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Efficiency of the PCR reaction was calculated using the formula E = 10(–1/slope); the slopes obtained by plotting cycle crossing point values (CP) as a function of cDNA template (22Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). The relative quantitation for any given gene was calculated after determination of the difference between CP of the target gene and that of the calibrator gene hypoxanthine ribosyl transferase (HPRT) in ERRα–/– and ERRα+/+ mice, and correction for efficiency, using the formula: Ratio = (Etarget)ΔCP target(WT-KO)/(EHPRT)ΔCP HPRT(WT-KO) (23Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25872) Google Scholar). CP values are the mean of triplicate measurement, and experiments were done in duplicate. β-Oxidation Activity in Intestinal Epithelium—Intestinal epithelial cells from adult mice fasted for 18 h were isolated as described in the Western blot section and homogenized on ice with 5 vol of 250 mm sucrose containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was used for β-oxidation assay as reported previously (20Murase T. Aoki M. Wakisaka T. Hase T. Tokimitsu I. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1312-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the β-oxidation reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 nm MgCl2, 1 nm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm l-carnitine, 0.2 mm NAD+, l-malate 0.5 mm, 0.05 mm flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), 0.12 mm CoA, 0.1 μCi of [14C]palmitic acid, 100 μg of protein of extract in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was started by adding the protein extract and incubating the preparation at 37 °C for 25 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of 0.6 n perchloric acid. Negative controls where the reaction was stopped at zero time were carried out in parallel. The reaction mixture was washed three times with 800 μl of hexane to remove residual radiolabeled palmitic acid. The radioactivity retained in the aqueous phase was measured. The assay was done in duplicate. Protein concentrations were determined in duplicate using Bio-Rad protein reagents. Fecal Fat Analysis—As previously described for stool lipid analysis (24Lowe M.E. Kaplan M.H. Jackson-Grusby L. D'Agostino D. Grusby M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31215-31221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), 100-mg aliquots of droppings collected from ERRα-null and wild-type mice of the indicated ages were mixed with a small amount of [carboxyl-14C]triolein (112 mCi/mmol) and dried for 1 h in a vacuum oven at 70 °C. The solid matter was extracted with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) for 30 min at 60 °C, passed through a Whatman No. 1 filter, and brought to a final volume of 4 ml with chloroform/methanol (2:1). The material was back-extracted with 1 ml of H2O, and the organic phase was evaporated to dryness. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and transferred to preweighed vials. The solvent was evaporated, and the vial was taken to a constant weight by drying in a vacuum oven at 70 °C. The difference in weight between the starting empty vial and the vial containing the dried lipid was the fecal lipid amount, which was expressed as a percentage of the weight of the starting fecal sample. To obtain stool from suckling animals, 10-day-old animals were sacrificed, and the entire colon was removed. The feces was removed by extrusion, pooled from several animals, and processed as for adult animals. The percent recovery of radiolabeled triolein (85–90%) was determined by subjecting the vial to scintillation counting. ApoA-IV Promoter Cloning—The mouse apoC-III/apoA-IV intergenic region was amplified by PCR using mouse genomic DNA as template and subcloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pLuc. Deletion mutants were produced with subcloning into pLuc or ptkLuc luciferase reporter plasmids. The integrity of each construct was confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids and Cell Transfections—Plasmid expressing the VP16-ERRα fusion protein was constructed by subcloning PCR-amplified ERRα cDNA into pCMX-VP16 downstream of the transcriptional activation domain of the VP16 protein. The pCDNA3.1HA-hPGC-1α vector was obtained from A. Kralli (La Jolla, CA). Caco-2/15 cells were a gift from Dr. J. F. Beaulieu (Université de Sherbrooke, Canada), and COS-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in phenol red-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 units/ml), and 10% heat-inactivated charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. 18 h prior to transfection, the cells were seeded in 12-well plates. A total of 1–1.2 μg of DNA/well was transfected including 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.25 μg of internal control pCMVβGal, 0.05–0.2 μg of pCMX-ERRα, 0.1 μg of pCMX-VP16-ERRα, 0.1 μg of pCDNA3.1HA-hPGC-1α as specified in the figure legends. The DNA was introduced into cells using Fu-GENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The cells were harvested in a potassium phosphate lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Luciferase assays were performed as previously described (25Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L.-T. Giguère V. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The transfections were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity of each sample. All results represent experiment conducted in duplicate at least three times. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (26Laganière J. Deblois G. Giguère V. Russell D.W. Mangelsdorf D.J. Methods in Enzymology. 364. Academic Press, San Diego2003: 339-350Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 Caco-2/15 cells were transfected with 15 μg of pCMXhERRα 24 h before cross-linking for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and centrifuged. Pellets were incubated in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, supplemented with proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) for 15 min and sonicated 5 times for 10 s using a VirSonic 100 (Virtis) sonicator. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm to remove the debris, soluble chromatin was diluted 10-fold in chromatin immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.1) and immunoprecipitated using either the specific anti-hERRα polyclonal antibody (16Laganiere J. Tremblay G.B. Dufour C.R. Giroux S. Rousseau F. Giguere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18504-18510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or the preimmune serum. Following immunoprecipitation, 40 μg of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnologies) was added and incubated for 2 h. The precipitates were washed sequentially for 10 min each with buffer 1 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1 150 mm HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Precipitates were then washed three times with TE buffer and eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer. The eluates were pooled and incubated at 65 °C for at least 4 h. The isolated DNA fragments were purified according to QIAquick Spin Kit (Qiagen). Quantitative PCR was performed using LightCycler and Fast Start DNA Master SYBG Green1 (Roche Applied Science). The following primers pairs were used: apoC-III promoter: 5′-GTCAGCTAGGAAGGAATGAGGGCTCCCCAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGGGTTC-TGACCTGTTTTATATCATCTC-3′; apoC-III enhancer: 5′-TTATCAGTGGGTCCAGAGGGCAAAATAGGG-3′ and 5′-CTGAGCTCTCACAGCCCCTCCCAGCACCTC-3′; apoA-IV/C-III intergenic region: 5′ CCTAGTATCTCACCCAGCTCCCTCCTATGG-3′ and 5′-CTGTGCAACAGGCAGACTTAATGATTGGTG-3′. Enrichment of these regions was normalized against a negative control segment located 3-kb upstream of ERRα initiation start site, amplified with the following set of primers: 5′-GTGGCCCACAGGTGTCGCTC-AAGTCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGATGCAGTGTCCTTCTCCCCAGATTG-3′. For positive controls, we used enrichment of the ERRα promoter region as previously described (16Laganiere J. Tremblay G.B. Dufour C.R. Giroux S. Rousseau F. Giguere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18504-18510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). ERRα Is Expressed in Epithelial Cells throughout the Small Intestine—In situ hybridization was first used to evaluate the expression of ERRα throughout the intestinal mucosa of adult mice. As shown in Fig. 1A (top panel, AS), ERRα expression is restricted to epithelial cells with very little stromal hybridization. Western blot analysis was then performed with nuclear extracts from epithelial cells isolated from mice throughout the digestive tract and at the postnatal development stage to examine the presence of the ERRα protein. Prominent ERRα expression was detected in the small intestine from postnatal days 0 through 21, with lower levels in adult mice (Fig. 1B). In adult mice, ERRα was mainly expressed in epithelial cells involved in nutrient absorption such as duodenal, jejunal, and ileal segments of the digestive tract (Fig. 1C). Lower levels of ERRα were detected in the colon and stomach. Mice Deficient for ERRα Display Unique Intestinal Gene Expression Profiles Associated with Defects in β-Oxidation Capacity—To examine the in vivo function of ERRα in the intestine, we took advantage of the previously described ERRα-null mice (19Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.-A. Richard D. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Because intestinal tissues from ERRα-deficient mice were histologically normal (data not shown), we first performed microarray studies to determine intestinal gene expression associated with ERRα deficiency (Table I). Because interindividual variation is a concern in gene expression profiles, intestinal tissues from 3–4 mice were pooled before measurements. Furthermore, to identify differentially expressed genes relevant to both sex and in various genetic backgrounds, we performed microarrays in female mice of C57/BL6 genetic background, male in the same background and pooled male and female in the 129SvJ background. Last, genes found to be consistently differentially expressed were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. For internal validation, our studies confirmed the absence of ERRα expression in null mice (Table I). Interestingly, a group of genes involved in mitochondrial electron transport were consistently down-regulated in the intestine from ERRα-null mice. This includes NADH dehydrogenase and the cytochrome c oxidase (subunits 5a and 7c; both needed to couple electron transport to proton pumping in order to generate an electrochemical gradient), as well as ATP synthase functioning when the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane is effective for oxidative phosphorylation. PCG-1α is known to be involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. We found PGC-1α transcript levels to be decreased by 21% in the intestine from ERRα-null compared with wild-type mice (p < 0.05), although PGC-1α was not consistently identified as differentially expressed in microarray experiments (data not shown). This order of magnitude has been previously reported and could be physiologically important (27Jove M. Salla J. Planavila A. Cabrero A. Michalik L. Wahli W. Laguna J.C. Vazquez-Carrera M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 113-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Electron transport chain is linked to the mitochondrial β-oxidation and inhibition of the former results in suppression of the latter (28Eaton S. Bartlett K. Pourfarzam M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To investigate the physiological effect of ERRα deficiency on intestinal lipid catabolism, we measure the β-oxidation activity in intestinal epithelial cells isolated from ERRα–/– and ERRα+/+ mice. As shown in Fig. 2, deficiency for ERRα is associated with a significant decrease in intestinal palmitic acid oxidation capacity.Table IDifferentially expressed genes in the intestine of ERRα -knockout miceFunctionGeneFold changeUnigene no.Locus link no.DescriptionNuclear receptorEsrraAbsentMm 256326379Estrogen-related receptor αOxidative phosphorylationAtp5j2-1.7Mm 167457423ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrialAtp5j-1.7Mm 35311957ATP synthase, mitochondrial F0 complex subunit FCox5a-1.9Mm 36012858Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit VaCox7c-1.9Mm 4378612867Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit 7cNdufa2-1.7Mm 2986717991NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1α, subcomplex2Fat metabolismPnliprp2-2.3Mm 123018947Pancreatic lipase-related protein 2Fabp1-37.8Mm 2212614080Fatty acid-binding protein 1, liverFabp2-1.4Mm 2839814079Fatty acid-binding protein 2, intestinalApoa4-10.4Mm 453311808Apolipoprotein A-IVOther metabolismCpo-1.9Mm 3582012892Coproporphyrinogene oxidaseAng1-2.1Mm 256611727Angiogenin, ribonuclease family, member 1Ang2-2.1Mm 5705811731Angiogenin, ribonuclease family, member 2Itln-1.5Mm 14019216429IntelectinSpink4-2.1Mm 2524620731Serine protease inhibitor, Kazal type 4 Open table in a new tab ERRα-null Mice Display Alterations in the Expression of Genes Involved in Intestinal Lipid Handling as Well as Fat Malabsorption in Suckling Mice—Indeed, microarray results also revealed differential expression in a group of genes involved in dietary lipid handling (Table I). Among them, the expression of pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (PLRP2) was found to be expressed at lower levels in the intestine from ERRα-null versus wild-type mice. The expression of fatty acid-binding proteins 1 and 2 (L-FABP and I-FABP, respectively) were also reduced in ERRα-null versus wild-type mice. Of note are the high affinity and binding of these cytoplasmic FABPs for long chain fatty acids (29Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Klein"
https://openalex.org/W1978706791,"RING domains are found in a large number of eukaryotic proteins. Most function as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, catalyzing the terminal step in the ubiquitination process. Structurally, these domains have been characterized as binding two zinc ions in a stable cross-brace motif. The tumorigenic human γ-herpesvirus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a ubiquitin-protein ligase termed K3, which functions as an immune evasion molecule by ubiquitinating major histocompatibility complex class I. K3 possesses at its N terminus a domain related to cellular RING domains but with an altered zinc ligand arrangement. This domain was initially characterized as a plant homeodomain, a structure not previously known to function as an E3. Here, it is conclusively demonstrated that the K3 N-terminal domain is a variant member of the RING domain family and not a plant homeodomain. The domain is found to interact with the cellular ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH5A to -C and UbcH13, which dock to the equivalent surface as on classical cellular RING domains. Interaction with UbcH13 suggests a possible role for K3 in catalyzing Lys63-linked ubiquitination. RING domains are found in a large number of eukaryotic proteins.

Ubiquitination was originally characterized as a signal for protein destruction by the proteasome (1Tanaka K. Chiba T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, recent developments have implicated ubiquitin in control of a multitude of cellular processes including signal transduction, apoptosis, DNA repair, protein-protein interaction, endocytosis, and protein trafficking (2Wilkinson C.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 545-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 3Schnell J.D. Hicke L. J. Biol.

A host of proteins have been identified that can modify the ubiquitination process, bind ubiquitinated proteins, and deubiquitinate proteins. It has become apparent that the nature of the linkage in polyubiquitin chains dictates function, with Lys48-linked chains signaling proteasomal destruction and Lys63-linked chains controlling DNA repair and endocytic processes (5Varadan R. Assfalg M. Haririnia A. Raasi S. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7055-7063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Given the importance of the ubiquitination system, it is not surprising that viruses have developed methods to exploit it. The cellular ubiquitination machinery consists of a catalytic cascade of three classes of enzyme acting in concert to transfer the small protein ubiquitin onto target proteins. The first enzyme (E1) 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HECT, homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus; KSHV, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, also termed human herpesvirus 8; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; ESCRT-I, endosomal sorting complex required for transport; MARCH, membrane-associated RING-CH; PHD, plant homeodomain; Ub, ubiquitin; Ubc, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (H suffix indicates human enzyme); NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; DQF-COSY, double-quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; r.m.s., root mean square. is termed a ubiquitin-activating enzyme and forms a thiol-ester bond between its active site cysteine and the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction. The ubiquitin is then transferred to the cysteine residue of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Finally, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which possesses a substrate recognition module, acts to bridge E2 and the target, allowing formation of isopeptide bonds between target lysine ϵ-amino groups and ubiquitin molecules. This modification can lead to monoubiquitination or the creation of polyubiquitin chains on the substrate. Ubiquitin-protein ligases possess one of three possible E2-interacting domains. The HECT domain is an enzymatically active domain, forming an E3-Ub covalent intermediate before transfer to substrate (6Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12148-12154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). RING (7Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) domains are nonenzymatic and act as bridging proteins that bind to E2s. In addition to these domains, E3s possess a large variety of adaptor domains and motifs to allow binding to target proteins and accessory factors. The RING domain is a small (8 kDa), compact, and stable zinc-binding module. Two zinc ions are bound by a set of eight metal-ligating cysteine and histidine residues in what has been termed a “cross-brace” motif (11Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 12Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. Elliott M. Everett R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). These residues have a characteristic spacing (Fig. 1, A and B) and are subclassified into RING-HC (C3HC4) and RING-H2 (C3H2C3) domains dependent on whether the fifth metal ligand is a cysteine or histidine, respectively. In addition to the residue spacing, RING domains possess two highly conserved hydrophobic residues, one immediately N-terminal to metal ligand 5 and the other C-terminal to ligand 6, that form part of the hydrophobic core of the structure (Fig. 1, A and B). An interesting development in the field of ubiquitination came with the investigation of two viral systems: murine γ-herpesvirus 68 and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KSHV is a human herpesvirus and is implicated in the development of Kaposi's sarcoma in individuals afflicted by AIDS (13Chang Y. Cesarman E. Pessin M.S. Lee F. Culpepper J. Knowles D.M. Moore P.S. Science. 1994; 266: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (5015) Google Scholar, 14Cesarman E. Knowles D.M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Normally, MHC class I molecules present viral peptide antigens to cytotoxic T cells allowing recognition and destruction of infected cells. However, both murine γ-herpesvirus 68 and KSHV have developed an immune evasion strategy involving removal of cell surface MHC class I. This evasion is dependent on the expression of viral immediate early proteins: MK3 in the case of murine γ-herpesvirus 68 (15Stevenson P.G. Efstathiou S. Doherty P.C. Lehner P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8455-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and K3 and K5 for KSHV (16Ishido S. Wang C. Lee B.S. Cohen G.B. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) (also referred to as MIR1 and -2, respectively). These proteins share a highly conserved N-terminal domain (MK3/K3, 40% identity; and K3/K5, 64% identity), two transmembrane domains, and a far less well conserved C-terminal region. Genes encoding homologous proteins have also been identified in other γ-herpesviruses, some poxviruses, and humans (17Fruh K. Bartee E. Gouveia K. Mansouri M. Virus Res. 2002; 88: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Bartee E. Mansouri M. Hovey Nerenberg B.T. Gouveia K. Fruh K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Experiments have demonstrated that MK3, K3, and K5 possess ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. All are able to catalyze the transfer of multiple ubiquitin molecules to MHC class I molecules in model systems. In the case of MK3, class I molecules are ubiquitinated on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and destroyed by the proteasome (19Boname J.M. Stevenson P.G. Immunity. 2001; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In contrast, K3 promotes ubiquitination in a post-endoplasmic reticulum compartment, leading to endocytosis of cell surface class I (20Coscoy L. Sanchez D.J. Ganem D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 21Hewitt E.W. Duncan L. Mufti D. Baker J. Stevenson P.G. Lehner P.J.

Virol. 2001; 82: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Endocytosed class I molecules are then routed to the lysosome for destruction in a process dependent on Tsg101, a component of the mammalian ESCRT-I endosomal sorting complex (21Hewitt E.W. Duncan L. Mufti D. Baker J. Stevenson P.G. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2418-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Nine human, cellular homologs of K3, termed MARCH proteins, have been identified, and two (MARCH-IV and MARCH-IX) have a ubiquitin ligase activity similarly targeted against MHC class I (18Bartee E.

The domain at the N terminus of these proteins was initially identified as a plant homeodomain (PHD). This domain binds two zinc ions in an interleaved fashion similar to that employed by RING domains (23Capili A.D. Schultz D.C. Rauscher I.F. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). PHD and RING domains differ most obviously in the order of the metal ligands, with the middle two ligands swapped to give a C4HC3 arrangement in the PHD domain. However, recent reports have disputed the classification of these proteins' domains as PHD domains based only on the nature of the metal ligands (24Scheel H. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 285-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Coscoy L. Ganem D. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 7-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Coscoy L. Ganem D.

The domains lack a crucial tryptophan residue, 2 residues N-terminal to the seventh metal ligand, which is absolutely conserved in all PHD domains (Fig. 1, A and B). In PHD domains, this residue is involved in making contacts within the hydrophobic core, whereas in RING domains it is solvent exposed. This results in a substantial structural difference between PHD and RING domains in the region between the sixth and seventh metal ligands. In most RING domains of known structure, this stretch forms a helical segment containing a hydrophobic residue involved in E2 binding. In PHD domains, the chain diverges significantly from the path taken in all RING domains of known structure and approaches the second zinc-binding site from the opposite direction. Most PHD domains possess proline residues in this region, which are known to disrupt helix formation. Two recent reports have applied more rigorous techniques using hidden Markov models (24Scheel H. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 285-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and analysis of conserved structural features (27Aravind L. Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to lend credence to the reclassification of the viral domains as variants of the classic RING domain. These variant domains are found within proteins from a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms including yeast, plants, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals. The question of classification extends beyond the issue of nomenclature. The suggestion that PHD domains in general could function as ubiquitin ligases would have huge implications, since many PHD-containing proteins are chromatin-associated and involved in genome maintenance and control. In this study, the solution structure of the N-terminal domain of the KSHV K3 protein has been determined. This unambiguously confirms its identification as a variant member of the RING domain family, resembling classic RINGs in many important respects. A yeast two-hybrid assay has been used to establish to which E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes the K3 RING can bind and these findings have been confirmed in vitro. Using 15N-labeled protein, the E2-binding surface on the RING has been mapped by NMR chemical shift perturbations to a region equivalent to that on classic RING domains. Protein Preparation—The RING region of the KSHV K3 gene, corresponding to residues 1–60, was cloned into a modified pRSET(A) plasmid (Invitrogen) containing a lipoyl domain fusion tag and expressed by the E. coli strain C41(DE3) at 20 °C. For isotope labeling, K-MOPS minimal medium (28Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 15N-labeled NH4Cl and/or 13C-labeled glucose was used. Full-length sequences encoding UbcH5A to -C (UBE2D1 to -3) were cloned into the pETM-12 vector (EMBL), and UbcH13 (UBE2N) was cloned into pET-23d (Novagen). E2 proteins were expressed in Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (Novagen) at a temperature of 20 °C. All proteins were purified on an Ni2+-NTA superflow column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) at 4 °C and washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0. The proteins were eluted with 300 mm imidazole in this same buffer. Proteins were then dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and in the case of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes immediately purified further on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). RING domain was treated with thrombin following dialysis and run again on Ni2+-NTA superflow to remove the lipoyl tag before application of the flow-through to a Superdex 75 column. Fractions containing RING were pooled and dialyzed against the appropriate NMR buffers. 1 mm RING domain was dialyzed into a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 (containing 10% D2O). 0.3 mm RING-Ubc complexes were dialyzed into a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (containing 10% D2O). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Constructs encoding the first 80 residues of wild-type and W41A K3 (up to the start of the first transmembrane domain) were cloned into the prey vector pACTBD-B by in vivo gap repair cloning as described previously (29Estevez A.M. Lehner B. Sanderson C.M. Ruppert T. Clayton C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34943-34951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Full-length open reading frames for all of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes screened were cloned by in vivo gap repair into the bait vector pGBAD-B. The bait plasmids encoding the TRP1 marker were transformed by electroporation into the yeast strain PJ69-4A (MATa trp1–901 leu2–3, 112 ura3–52, his3–200 gal4Δ gal80 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ) and tested for self-activation. The prey plasmids encoding the LEU2 marker were transformed into a mating type-switched, MATα derivative of PJ69–4A. Yeast containing the prey vectors were mated with MATa yeast containing the bait vectors on YPDA plates for 6 h at 30 °C before being replica-plated onto synthetic dropout (SD)-Trp/Leu plates to select for diploid yeast and (SD)-Trp/Leu/His and (SD)-Trp/Leu/Ade plates to assess the extent of reporter activation. Yeast strains were kindly provided by Dr. Philip James (Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), whereas bait and prey vectors were provided by Dr. David Markie (Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Pathology Department, Dunedin School of Medicine, Dunedin, New Zealand). NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance-800, Avance-600, and DMX-500 spectrometers. Two-dimensional NOESY, TOCSY, DQF-COSY, 15N HSQC, constant time 13C HSQC, and HNCA HNCO and three-dimensional HNHB, 15N NOESY, and 15N TOCSY were recorded at 298 K. The mixing times chosen were 55 ms for TOCSY and 120 ms for NOESY. Spectra were referenced relative to external sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate for signals of proton and carbon or liquid ammonia for that of nitrogen. The resonances were assigned using interresidue NOE connectivities by standard procedures (30Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Approximately half the Hβ resonances were assigned stereospecifically using a combination of HNHB and DQF-COSY spectra. All of the Val Hγ and Leu Hδ resonances were stereospecifically assigned using a 10% 13C-labeled sample of the K3 RING domain (31Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—The distance constraints derived from the NOESY spectra were classified into four categories corresponding to interproton distance constraints of 1.8–2.8, 1.8–3.5, 1.8–4.75, and 1.8–6.0 Å, respectively. Hydrogen bonds were identified from an ensemble of structures calculated using only NOE and torsion angle restraints. Protein backbone NH groups whose signals were observed to slowly change with D2O at 283 K were assigned to acceptor groups and had hydrogen bonding restraints imposed. Subsequently, the structures were recalculated to check that the hydrogen bonds could be included without increasing the energy of the calculated structures and without altering the overall structure. By applying a simulated annealing protocol (32Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) implemented in the XPLOR package (33Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) on 30 random structures with the 1260 experimental constraints, 28 structures were accepted where no distance violation was greater than 0.25 Å and no dihedral angle violation was larger than 5°. All of the spectroscopic characteristics suggested that the N-terminal residues up to Val6 were unfolded, and hence these residues were excluded from the statistical analysis. Chemical shift mapping was performed by acquiring 1H-15N HSQC spectra from solutions of K3 RING mixed with either UbcH5A or UbcH13 in a 1:1 molar ratio in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Electrostatic Potential Calculations—The program GROMACS (34Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) was used to create a Protein Data Bank file containing the charge and radius for each atom. This file was used as an input for the potential program from the MEAD suite (35Bashford, D. (1997) in Scientific Computing in Object-oriented Parallel Environments: First International Conference, Iscope 97, Marina Del Rey, CA, December 8–11, 1997: Proceedings (Ishikawa, Y., Oldehoeft, R. R., Reynders, J. V. W., and Tholburn, M., eds) pp. 233-240, Springer-Verlag, BerlinGoogle Scholar). MEAD was used to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to generate a three-dimensional map of the electrostatic potential field. Surface potential was visualized by coloring a molecular surface according to values in the MEAD-generated map. Solution Structure of the K3 N-terminal C4HC3 Domain— The solution structure of the K3 N-terminal domain was determined by heteronuclear NMR methods using 15N-labeled protein samples. A summary of the experimentally derived restraints used in structure calculations and the refinement statistics are presented in Table I. Backbone and all atom superpositions of 28 conformers are provided (Fig. 2, A and B). The structure, including side chains, is mostly very well defined except for a section of 5 residues outside the domain core at the extreme N terminus (root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of all atoms from their mean positions is 0.88 Å excluding this region). This section has few interactions with the rest of the protein and may as a result be quite disordered. The main chain torsion angles fall primarily within the preferred regions of conformational space (36Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar).Table ISummary of conformational constraints and statistics for the accepted 28 structures of the K3 RING domainParameterValueStructural constraintsIntraresidue460Sequential283Medium range (2 ≤ |i – j| ≤ 4)148Long range (|i – j| > 4)334Dihedral angle constraints23TALOS constraints80Distance constraints for six hydrogen bonds12Zinc coordination constraints20Total1360Statistics for accepted structuresStatistics parameter ± S.D.r.m.s. deviation for distance constraints0.0110 ± 0.0013 År.m.s. deviation for dihedral constraints0.592 ± 0.081°Mean X-PLOR energy term (kcal mol-1) ± S.D.E (overall)118.72 ± 9.31E (van der Waals)7.62 ± 1.91E (distance constraints)2.24 ± 0.59E (dihedral and TALOS constraints)10.61 ± 0.76r.m.s. deviations from ideal geometry ± S.D.Bond lengths0.0021 ± 0.0002 ÅBond angles0.586 ± 0.016°Improper angles0.380 ± 0.014°Average atomic r.m.s. deviation from the meanstructure ± S.D.Residues 6-59 (N, Cα, C atoms)0.405 ± 0.068 ÅResidues 6-59 (all heavy atoms)0.881 ± 0.088 Å Open table in a new tab The overall topology of the fold is as expected with two interleaved zinc binding sites located at opposite sides of the domain, the first composed of three cysteine and one histidine side chains and the second composed completely of cysteines. Only a very limited amount of regular secondary structure is present (Fig. 3A). This secondary structure consists primarily of a 10-residue α-helix between the sixth and seventh metal ligands, although there is also a very small two-strand β-sheet toward the N terminus of the domain and a single turn of helix between the fourth and fifth ligands. The remainder of the domain is composed of ordered loops, restrained by the two zinc-binding sites, and a small hydrophobic core. The two tryptophan residues invariant among the subfamily of viral C4HC3 domains are not buried within the domain core; rather, they are located together on the surface, with the planes of the two side chains perpendicular to one another (Fig. 3A, purple side chains). This creates a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the molecule that is part of an extended hydrophobic region (Fig. 4A). Adjacent to these tryptophan residues is a small but pronounced hydrophobic pocket. Aside from this nonpolar region, the surface possesses some major charged regions (Fig. 4B). There is a highly negatively charged region that includes the surface abutting zinc site 1 and forms a shallow groove on the protein surface. This region is contiguous with the five N-terminal disordered residues, four of which are also acidic, negatively charged residues (sequence MEDED). The high negative charge in this section of the surface may allow interaction with a basic region elsewhere within the K3 molecule or within target molecules, although the precise mechanism of substrate recognition and ubiquitination is yet to be determined. On the opposite surface of the domain is a positively charged region composed predominantly of four arginine side chains. It is tempting to speculate that this region may interact with the C-terminal region of K3, which contains a high proportion of acidic residues. Structural Comparison with RING and PHD Domains—In order to determine the closest structural homologs of the K3 N-terminal domain, a search was performed against the Protein Data Bank data base using the EMBL DALI server (37Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/index.html). Three significantly related structures were found, all of which were RING domains: EL5, a RING-H2 protein (r.m.s. deviation of Cα atoms 3.9 Å, 48 residues aligned), the C4C4 RING NOT4 transcriptional repressor (r.m.s. deviation 2.7 Å, 48 residues aligned), and RAG1 (r.m.s. deviation 3.8 Å, 51 residues aligned). The server found no significant similarity with PHD domains. A direct comparison of the K3 domain with a representative C3HC4 RING (RAG1) and a PHD domain (KAP-1) demonstrates that the K3 domain shares many more features with the C3HC4 RING (Fig. 3, A–C). The overall tertiary structure of the K3 domain is strikingly similar to that of the RAG1 RING domain, both sharing the α-helix conserved within members of the RING domain family. Although the K3 domain lacks the β-sheet located between the two zinc-binding sites in C3HC4-type domains (Fig. 3B), the overall topology of the chain in this region and throughout the core of the domain is very similar. The possession of an α-helix in place of this β-sheet may be a common feature of the viral domains based on their high sequence similarity. The second tryptophan in the K3 domain is also located at a position within the α-helix precisely equivalent to that of a conserved hydrophobic residue in RING domains. The PHD domain of KAP-1 follows a similar path to both the K3 domain and the RAG1 RING up to the sixth metal ligand prior to the RING α-helix. However, after this point, the KAP-1 chain diverges significantly (Fig. 3C, red section of chain), with no α-helix formed and a different main-chain conformation allowing burial of the additional PHD-specific tryptophan residue (23Capili A.D. Schultz D.C. Rauscher I.F. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results establish unambiguously that the K3 C4HC3-type domain (and by inference those of the entire related viral and human families) is a variant type of RING domain. Identification of K3-interacting Ubiquitin-conjugating Enzymes—In order to function as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, a protein must interact with at least one ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The KSHV genome itself does not encode any members of the Ubc family, suggesting that K3 exploits a cellular E2 to fulfill its function. In order to determine whether K3 could bind to any E2 proteins, a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed. In the assay, the K3 RING domain was used as bait against a selection of 24 human Ubc proteins. Only four of the possible Ubc proteins were identified as binding partners for K3: the core cellular E2s UbcH5A to -C and UbcH13 (Table II). Of these, only UbcH13 gave a signal on the more stringent Ade selection. A W41A mutant of the K3 RING, which lacks the conserved tryptophan residue important for c-Cbl interaction with UbcH7 (38Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), was also included in the screen. Expression of K3 W41A in a cell culture model of K3 action results in an inactive molecule that, while able to bind MHC class I, is unable to promote ubiquitination (21Hewitt E.W. Duncan L. Mufti D. Baker J. Stevenson P.G. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2418-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This mutant was found to be incapable of interaction with any of the E2s screened. The C-terminal region of K3 (following the second transmembrane domain) was found not to interact with any E2 enzymes (data not shown).Table IIYeast two-hybrid screen of the K3 RING domain against ubiquitin-conjugating enzymesPrey geneK3 RINGK3 RING W41AAdeaSelection to test for expression of either ADE2 or HIS3HisaSelection to test for expression of either ADE2 or HIS3AdeHisUBE2Anbn, no signal; a, autoactivation; +, signal detectednnnUBE2BnnnnUBE2CnnnnUBE2D1cUBE2D1 to -3 encode UbcH5A to -C; UBE2N encodes UbcH13n+nnUBE2D2n+nnUBE2D3n+nnUBE2E1nnnnUBE2E3nnnnUBE2G1nnnnUBE2G2nanaUBE2HnnnnUBE2InnnnUBE2L3nnnnUBE2L6nnnnUBE2MnnnnUBE2NcUBE2D1 to -3 encode UbcH5A to -C; UBE2N encodes UbcH13++nnUBE2V1 transcript 1nnnnUBE"
https://openalex.org/W2019026057,"Sprouty/Spred family proteins have been identified as negative regulators of growth factor-induced ERK/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. However, it has not been clarified whether these proteins regulate cytokine-induced ERK activity. We found that Spred-1 is highly expressed in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent hematopoietic cell lines and bone marrow-derived mast cells. To investigate the roles of Spred-1 in hematopoiesis, we expressed wild-type Spred-1 and a dominant negative form of Spred-1, ΔC-Spred, in IL-3- and stem cell factor (SCF)-dependent cell lines as well as hematopoietic progenitor cells from mouse bone marrow by retrovirus gene transfer. In IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells expressing c-kit, forced expression of Spred-1 resulted in a reduced proliferation rate and ERK activation in response to not only SCF but also IL-3. In contrast, ΔC-Spred augmented IL-3-induced cell proliferation and ERK activation. Wild-type Spred-1 inhibited colony formation of bone marrow cells in the presence of cytokines, whereas ΔC-Spred-1 expression enhanced colony formation. Augmentation of ERK activation and proliferation in response to IL-3 was also observed in Spred-1-deficient bone marrow-derived mast cells. These data suggest that Spred-1 negatively regulates hematopoiesis by suppressing not only SCF-induced but also IL-3-induced ERK activation.

ERK activation is initiated by binding of Grb2 to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues of the receptor or phosphorylated adaptor molecules such as Shc, FRS-2, IRS-1/2, SHP-2, and Gab-1. The complex of Grb2 and SOS (son of sevenless) activates Ras by GTP loading. Ras-GTP recruits Raf1 to the plasma membrane (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar, 2Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar), which is then phosphorylated and activated by several, not well defined, kinases with complex regulatory mechanisms (3Morrison D.K.

Activated Raf then phosphorylates and activates the dual-specific kinase MEK, which phosphorylates and activates ERKs. In addition, the Ras-independent Raf1-ERK activation mechanism has been recently demonstrated, and members of the protein kinase C family of serine/threonine kinases have been implicated as potential activators of Raf (6Sasaki A. Taketomi T. Kato R. Saeki K. Nonami A. Sasaki M. Kuriyama M. Saito N. Shibuya M. Yoshimura A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases including ERKs play important roles in hematopoiesis. Most hematopoietic cytokines (hematopoietins) activate the JAK-STAT and Ras-ERK pathways, both being required for a satisfactory level of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. For example, STAT5 activation is not sufficient for EPO-dependent growth of CTLL2 cells expressing EPO receptor, but additional activation of MAP kinases can support their cellular proliferation in response to EPO (7Sakamoto H. Kitamura T. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35857-35862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MAP kinases have also been shown to play a critical role in megakaryopoiesis by c-mpl (8Rojnuckarin P. Miyakawa Y. Fox N.E. Deou J. Daum G. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41014-41022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how MAP kinase is regulated in hematopoietic cells. One of important regulators of MAP kinase is the MAP kinase-specific dual specificity protein phosphatase (MKP), which targets both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine on most activated MAP kinases (9Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of MKPs in hematopoiesis has not been clarified. Recently, we cloned a family of novel membrane-bound molecules, Spreds, that are related to Sproutys (10Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Drosophila Sprouty was identified as a negative regulator for several growth factor-induced ERK activation, including FGF and EGF (11Minowada G. Jarvis L.A. Chi C.L. Neubuser A. Sun X. Hacohen N.

We have identified three members of the Spred family of proteins in mammals (17Kato R. Nonami A. Taketomi T. Wakioka T. Kuroiwa A. Matsuda Y. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that have a Sprouty-related C-terminal cysteine-rich (SPR) domain in addition to the N-terminal Ena/VASP homology (EVH) 1 domain. The SPR domain of Sprouty, and probably Spred, is palmitoylated; thereby, Sprouty and Spred localize in membrane fraction. Like Sprouty, Spred-1, Spred-2, and Spred-3 also down-regulate growth factor-mediated Ras/ERK signaling. We have shown that Spred interacts with Ras and inhibits Raf kinase activation without reducing Ras activation, and interestingly, it stabilizes EGF-induced Raf-1 translocation from cytosol to plasma membrane (10Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). As Spred inhibits active-Ras-induced ERK activation, Spred might modulate the unidentified activation steps of Raf by a novel mechanism. It was also revealed that the C-terminal deletion mutant of Spred-1 functions as a dominant negative form against endogenous Spred-1 and augments serum- and NGF-induced ERK activation. Spred/Sprouty family proteins have emerged as negative regulators of the ERK pathway; however, details of the physiological functions of each member remain to be investigated. We have shown that Spred-2 was expressed in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region and negatively regulates AGM hematopoiesis (18Nobuhisa I. Kato R. Inoue H. Takizawa M. Okita K. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that expression of Spred-1, but not Spred-2, is high in mature hematopoietic cells. In this study, we demonstrated that Spred-1 is a negative regulator of ERK activation in response to not only SCF but also to cytokines such as IL-3. Spred-1 is also demonstrated to be a physiological negative regulator of bone marrow hematopoiesis. Cell Lines and Mast Cell Cultures—HEK293 cells and the retrovirus packaging cell line, Plat-E, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The murine pro-B cell-derived cell line, Ba/F3, was cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% conditioned medium from WEHI-3B cells as a source of IL-3. Ba/F3 cells expressing c-kit (Ba/F3-kit) were established as described (19Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copel-and N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). A murine mast cell-derived cell line, MC9, was cultured in RPMI medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 ng/ml IL-3. Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) were obtained from a culture of bone marrow cells in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 ng/ml murine IL-3, 10% fetal calf serum, non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Spred-1 Knockout Mice—A targeting vector construction, targeting of embryonic stem cells, generation of chimeric mice, and detailed analysis of the knockout mice will be published elsewhere. Plasmids, Transfection, and Infection—Wild-type Spred-1 and C-terminal-truncated Spred-1 (ΔC-Spred-1) were subcloned into pCDNA3 for the 6× Myc epitope tag or pMY-IRES-EGFP for retrovirus infection as described (20Sasaki A. Taketomi T. Wakioka T. Kato R. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36804-36808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Various mutants of Spred-1 (ΔC, ΔN1, ΔKBD, ΔIR, R247A) in pcDNA3 were described previously (10Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). pCDNA3 vectors were transfected into 293 cells on 6-well dishes by the calcium phosphate method. pMX-IRES-EGFP vectors were transfected into a Plat-E packaging cell line using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) to obtain the viruses (21Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Shouda T. Kitamura T. Dikic I. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29338-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Ba/F3-kit cells (2 × 105 cells) were infected with viruses on a RetroNectin (Takara Bio inc.)-coated plate for 24 h in the presence of 5 ng/ml IL-3. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in RPMI 1640–10% fetal bovine serum containing 5 ng/ml IL-3 or 100 ng/ml SCF, and incubated for the indicated times. Then, cells (1 × 104) were analyzed for enhanced GFP (EGFP) fluorescence on a Coulter EPICS-XL flow cytometer. GFP-ERK was a gift from Dr. Y. Goto (Tokyo University). Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was assayed using a cell counting kit (Dojindo Laboratories). Briefly, 5 × 103 cells were plated in 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium with various concentrations of SCF or IL-3 and cultured for 72 h. After adding WST-1 and 1-methoxy phenazine methosulfate, the optical density for 450 nm was measured. Immunochemical Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed using anti-Myc, anti-c-kit, anti-STAT5, anti-ERK2, anti-JNK, anti-G-CSF receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-phospho STAT5, anti-phospho ERK2, anti-Akt (Cell signaling), anti-pY (Transduction laboratories), anti-phospho JNK (Calbiochem), and anti-phospho Akt (Biosourse International) as described (20Sasaki A.

Anti-Spred-1 and -2 antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits (10Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In Vitro Colony Assay—Single cell suspensions were isolated from the bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice, and red blood cells were lysed using NH4Cl. These cells were infected with the retroviruses (control, wild-type Spred-1, ΔC-Spred-1) on a RetroNectin (Takara)-coated plate for 48 h. GFP-positive bone marrow cells were sorted by EPICS ALTRA (Beckman Coulter), and 3 × 103 GFP-positive cells were plated in methylcellulose (Methocult3434, Stem Cell Technologies Inc.) containing 5 ng/ml IL-3 and 50 ng/ml SCF, IL-6, and 3 units of EPO. On day 14, colonies were enumerated and stained for differential counting (23Metcalf D. Hemopoietic Colonies: In Vitro Cloning of Normal and Leukemic Cells. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., 1977: 12-35Crossref Google Scholar). The numbers of colonies for colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), and colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) were counted microscopically. Expression Spred-1 in Hemopoietic Cells—To examine the expression of Spred-1 or Spred-2 in hematopoietic cells, we performed Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, Spred-1 was detected in two IL-3-dependent cell lines, Ba/F3 and MC9. Spred-1 was also detected in mature BMMCs. We could not detect Spred-1 in non-hematopoietic 293 cells (Fig. 1A). Spred-2 expression was not detected by Western blotting, suggesting that the expression levels of Spred-2 in Ba/F3 cells are not as high as Spred-1 (Fig. 1A). Spred-1 expression levels increased during culture of bone marrow (BM) cells in the presence of IL-3. Spred-1 was not detected in freshly isolated BM cells, whereas maximum expression was observed after 5–8 weeks of culture in IL-3, in which most of the cells become BMMCs (Fig. 1B). We could not detect Spred-1 protein in neutrophils (data not shown). These data suggest that Spred-1 is highly expressed in a particular subset of hematopoietic cells or that Spred-1 expression was induced by IL-3. We have shown that exogenous Spred-1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to SCF in 293 cells expressing c-kit. To examine the phosphorylation of endogenous Spred-1, Ba/F3 cells expressing c-kit (Ba/F3-kit) were stimulated with SCF. As shown in Fig. 1C, endogenous Spred-1 was phosphorylated in response to SCF in Ba/F3-kit cells. We also observed SCF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in BMMCs (Fig. 1D). On the other hand, we could not detect IL-3-induced phosphorylation of Spred-1 in Ba/F3-kit cells and BMMCs (Fig. 1, C and D). These data indicate that endogenous Spred-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by hematopoietic growth factor stimulation. Suppression of Cytokine-induced ERK Activation by Spred-1— We have shown that wild-type Spred-1 suppressed EGF- and FGF-induced ERK activation and that the C-terminal deletion mutant of Spred-1 (ΔC-Spred-1) functions as a dominant negative form against NGF and serum stimulation (10Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We first confirmed that overexpression of wild-type (WT) Spred-1 suppressed SCF-induced ERK activation as compared with the control, whereas ΔC-Spred-1 augmented ERK activation in 293 cells (Fig. 2A). Then, we investigated the effect of Spred-1 on cytokine receptor signaling, which utilizes JAKs. First, using various Spred-1 mutants, we examined which part of the protein is necessary for suppressing EPO-induced ERK activation. As shown in Fig. 2B, WT-Spred-1 suppressed EPO-induced ERK activation. Similarly, a mutant lacking the internal region between the EVH domain and KBD domain (ΔIR) and mutants of the kit binding domain (ΔKBD and R247A) suppressed EPO-induced ERK activation, indicating that the internal region and KBD are not essential for suppression of ERK. These are similar to our previous results obtained for EGF-induced ERK activation (10Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, ΔIR and ΔKBD seemed to have a weaker effect than R247A and WT-Spred-1. This may be due to large conformational changes by internal deletions. On the other hand, the N-terminal deletion mutant of Spred-1 (ΔN1), which lacks the EVH1 domain and internal region but contains the KBD and C-terminal SPR domain, strongly enhanced basal level of phosphorylation of ERK, although the precise mechanism of this phenomenon has not been clarified. However, overexpression of ΔC-Spred-1 did not much affect the basal level of ERK phosphorylation. Therefore, we further investigated the effect of ΔC-Spred-1 on ERK activation. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, overexpression of wild-type Spred-1 strongly suppressed EPO- or G-CSF-induced ERK activation, whereas ΔC-Spred-1 augmented EPO- or G-CSF-induced ERK activation. These results suggested that ΔC-Spred-1 functions as a dominant negative form of Spred-1, which augments not only growth factor-induced but also cytokine-induced ERK activation. Suppression of Proliferation of Hematopoietic Cells by Spred-1—We next examined the effect of wild-type Spred-1 and ΔC-Spred-1 on proliferation of Ba/F3-kit cells. Wild-type Spred-1 and ΔC-Spred-1 cDNAs were introduced into Ba/F3-kit cells with EGFP using a bicistronic retrovirus vector pMY-IRES-EGFP (21Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Shouda T. Kitamura T. Dikic I. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29338-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Since the infected cells expressed both EGFP and FLAG-tagged Spred-1, the percentage of infected cells was determined as the EGFP-positive rate by flow cytometry. When Ba/F3-kit cells were cultured in a medium containing IL-3 for 3 weeks, the proportion of control IRES-EGFP-infected cells was not changed; however, the population of wild-type Spred-1-infected cells decreased, whereas that of ΔC-Spred-1-infected cells increased (Fig. 3A). Ba/F3-kit cells could survive 7 days at most in the presence of SCF without IL-3. As shown in Fig. 3B, SCF-dependent cell proliferation was also decreased by wild-type Spred-1 but increased to some extent by ΔC-Spred-1 infection. The suppressive and enhancing effects of wild-type Spred-1 and ΔC-Spred-1 on proliferation, respectively, were confirmed by infected Ba/F3-kit clones. Wild-type Spred-1- and ΔC-Spred-1-infected Ba/F3-kit cells were cloned by limiting dilution. The dose-response experiments to IL-3 and SCF using three independent clones revealed that WT-Spred-1 suppressed, whereas ΔC-Spred-1 significantly augmented cell growth (Fig. 3, C and D). These data indicate that Spred-1 inhibits not only growth factor-induced but also cytokine-induced proliferation. Suppression of MAP Kinase Activation in Hematopoietic Cells by Spred-1—To explore the mechanism of the regulation of proliferation by WT- and ΔC-Spred-1 in Ba/F3-kit cells, we examined the level of ERK phosphorylation at steady state culture conditions with IL-3. As shown in Fig. 4A, ERK phosphorylation levels were lower in WT-Spred-1-infected clones, whereas they were higher in ΔC-Spred-1-infected clones than GFP-infected control clones. Thus, suppression and augmentation of proliferation by WT-Spred-1 and ΔC-Spred-1 shown in Fig. 3 could be due to the modulation of activation levels of ERK. Therefore, we examined the SCF- or IL-3-induced signaling pathways. In a wild-type Spred-1-infected clone, IL-3-induced ERK1/2 activation was suppressed as compared with the control, although STAT5 activation was not affected (Fig. 4B). SCF-induced ERK1/2 activation was also suppressed in wild-type Spred-1-infected cells, whereas Akt activation was not changed. On the other hand, ΔC-Spred-1 infection resulted in a slight but significant augmentation of IL-3- and SCF-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 4C). We have shown that Spreds suppress ERK activation by inhibiting Raf, but not Ras, activation in response to growth factors (10Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, WT-Spred-1 suppressed Raf-1 activation, whereas ΔC-Spred-1 enhanced it, as monitored by Ser-338 phosphorylation, further suggesting that Spred-1 inhibits ERK by suppressing Raf activation and ΔC-Spred-1 function as a dominant negative form of endogenous WT-Spreds. To examine whether Spred-1-induced negative regulation is restricted to ERK, we investigated the effect of Spred-1 on the other MAP kinase, JNK. We stimulated Ba/F3 cells with tumor necrosis factor-α since JNK activation was marginal in response to SCF or IL-3 in Ba/F3 cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, Spred-1 did not affect tumor necrosis factor-α-induced JNK activation. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that Spred-1 affects other unknown pathways, these data suggest that wild-type Spred-1 suppresses the proliferation of Ba/F3-kit cells in the presence of IL-3 or SCF by suppressing ERK activation, whereas ΔC-Spred-1 augments proliferation through enhancing the ERK activity. Effects of Spred-1 on Proliferation and Differentiation of Primary Bone Marrow Cells—To determine the function of Spred-1 in primary hematopoietic progenitor cells, we performed in vitro colony assays using mouse BM cells. After retrovirus carrying wild-type or ΔC-Spred-1 and EGFP was infected into mouse BM cells, GFP-positive cells were sorted by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and plated in a methylcellulose culture medium containing various cytokines. More than 90% of the colonies expressed substantial levels of EGFP, as determined by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). The numbers of CFU-GM and BFU-E from wild-type Spred-1-infected BM cells significantly decreased (p < 0.01) as compared with control EGFP-infected BM cells (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the sizes of the colonies derived from wild-type Spred-1-infected BM cells were generally less than one-fifth of those from EGFP-infected BM cells (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, the number of CFU-GM and BFU-E from ΔC-Spred-1-infected BM cells slightly increased (p < 0.05) as compared with EGFP-infected BM cells (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that Spred-1 negatively regulates hematopoiesis of bone marrow cells by suppressing ERK pathway. Enhanced Proliferation and ERK Activation of Spred-1-deficient BMMCs—To further support our finding that Spred-1 regulates hematopoietic cytokine-induced ERK activation, we examined the effect of the loss of Spred-1 using BMMCs from Spred-1 knockout mice. Spred-1 knockout mice were born normally. BMMCs were induced by culturing bone marrow cells with IL-3 for 4 weeks. As shown in Fig. 6A, high levels of Spred-1 protein expression were detected in Spred-1+/+ BMMCs but not in Spred-1-/- BMMCs. SCF-induced ERK1/2 activation was sustained in Spred-1-/- BMMCs as compared with that of Spred-1+/+ BMMCs. We then examined IL-3-induced signaling pathways. As shown Fig. 6B, IL-3-induced ERK1/2 activation as well as Raf-1 activation was augmented and prolonged in Spred-1-deficient BMMCs as compared with that of Spred-1+/+ BMMCs, although JAK2 activation as well as STAT5 activation were not much affected. These data are consistent with our proposal that Spred-1 inhibits Ras/Raf/ERK pathway downstream of JAKs. IL-3-dependent growth of Spred-1-/- BMMCs was significantly faster than that of Spred-1+/+ BMMCs (Fig. 6C). These data also suggest that Spred-1 negatively regulates the growth of BMMCs by regulating the activation induced by hemopoietic growth factors and cytokines. ERKs are members of the MAP kinase family and have important roles in many facets of cellular regulation including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It has been well established that MAP kinase signaling pathways including ERK, p38, and JNK are activated by various cytokines and that growth factors are required in normal hematopoiesis (24Platanias L.C. Blood. 2003; 101: 4667-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Among these MAP kinase groups, ERK is activated by hematopoietic cytokines such as EPO, IL-3, and SCF (25Nosaka Y. Arai A. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30154-30162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Arai A. Kanda E. Miura O. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2641-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Sui X. Krantz S.B. You M. Zhao Z. Blood. 1998; 92: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Okuda K. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Kanakura Y. Hallek M. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2880-2887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that a novel ERK pathway inhibitor, Spred-1, can negatively suppress IL-3 as well as SCF-induced ERK activation without affecting STAT or Akt activation and can modulate cell proliferation. Since endogenous Spred-1 is expressed in hematopoietic cell lines and BMMCs, and ΔC-Spred-1 (a dominant negative form of Spreds) (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5) or deletion of the Spred-1 gene (Fig. 6) can enhance the effect of IL-3 and SCF, Spred-1 is suggested to be a physiological negative regulator of hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines. There are three members of the Spred family of proteins (17Kato R. Nonami A. Taketomi T. Wakioka T. Kuroiwa A. Matsuda Y. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Spred-2 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas Spred-1 expression is restricted in brain and heart, and Spred-3 is expressed only in the brain. In the present study, we showed that Spred-1 is also highly expressed in hematopoietic cells. However, Spred-1 is not expressed in all hematopoietic cells. Our reverse transcription-PCR analysis suggested that Spred-1 expression level was high in mast cells (BMMCs), erythroid cells, and B cells but low in megakaryocytes and macrophages. 2A. Nonami, unpublished data. Although we did not observe the rapid induction of Spred-1 protein expression in response to IL-3 and SCF in BMMCs, Spred-1 expression was strongly up-regulated during long term culture of BM cells in the presence of IL-3. This suggests that Spred-1 expression is restricted in a particular subset of hematopoietic cells or up-regulated during maturation of the cells. Therefore, unlike Sproutys, Spred-1 seems to be a developmentally regulated negative regulator rather than a negative feedback suppressor; it may be involved in regulation of the number and function of terminally differentiated cells. Interestingly, Spred-2 is shown to be expressed in AGM region, and overexpression of Spred-2 in the AGM culture significantly reduced the number of CD45+ cells. In contrast, production of CD45+ cells from the AGM region of Spred-2 null mice was up-regulated as compared with wild-type littermates (18Nobuhisa I. Kato R. Inoue H. Takizawa M. Okita K. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These data raise a possibility that Spred-2 functions as a negative regulator of embryonic hematopoiesis, whereas Spred-1 regulates the late phase of hematopoiesis by inhibiting hematopoietic cytokine signaling. Recent studies have revealed many proteins that negatively modulate the Ras/MAPK pathway. These proteins can be roughly divided into two groups: phosphatases and scaffold proteins. The former includes MKP-1 (9Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (30Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N.

The latter includes kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), Sur8, connector enhancer of KSR (CNK), rat kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), MP-1, RIN1, and the Sprouty/Spreds (33Kim H.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Two other novel proteins that also suppress the MAP kinase pathway, Erbin (34Huang Y.Z. Zang M. Xiong W.C. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1108-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and Sef (35Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), have recently been reported. P62dok is an adaptor molecule that recruits Ras-GTPase activating protein (GAP), resulting in the suppression of the Ras/MAPK pathway, and hematopoietic cells from P62dok knockout mice proliferate more rapidly after growth factor stimulation with sustained MAPK activation than wild-type cells do (36Di Cristofano A. Niki M. Zhao M. Karnell F.G. Clarkson B. Pear W.S. Van Aelst L. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The knockout mice showed a shortened latency of the myeloproliferative disease induced by retroviral-mediated transduction of p210bcr-abl in bone marrow cells (36Di Cristofano A. Niki M. Zhao M. Karnell F.G. Clarkson B. Pear W.S. Van Aelst L. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Lnk is another adaptor protein mainly expressed in lymphocytes that negatively regulates MAP kinase activation (37Takaki S. Morita H. Tezuka Y. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 38Velazquez L. Cheng A.M. Fleming H.E. Furlonger C. Vesely S. Bernstein A. Paige C.J. Pawson T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1599-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The absence of Lnk resulted in an increase in the number and in vitro proliferative capacity of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Spred-1 may have a similar function to Dok and Lnk in hematopoietic cells. These studies also revealed the importance in hematopoiesis of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway and its regulatory functions. The ERK pathway plays positive and negative roles in hematopoiesis. ERK1/2 activation has also been involved in mediating differentiation along the megakaryocytic and myeloid lineages. The ERK1/2 pathway antagonizes erythroid differentiation (39Secchiero P. Melloni E. Heikinheimo M. Mannisto S. Di Pietro R. Iacone A. Zauli G. Blood. 2004; 103: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas this pathway is necessary for GM-CSF-induced proliferation (40Kolonics A. Apati A. Janossy J. Brozik A. Gati R. Schaefer A. Magocsi M. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of G-CSF receptor indicates that ERK activation rather than STAT3 activation is required for proliferation (41Nicholson S.E. Novak U. Ziegler S.F. Layton J.E. Blood. 1995; 86: 3698-3704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ERK pathway has been also implicated directly and indirectly to play a critical role in megakaryopoiesis (42Fichelson S. Freyssinier J.M. Picard F. Fontenay-Roupie M. Guesnu M. Cherai M. Gisselbrecht S. Porteu F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1601-1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For example, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 can increase megakaryocyte precursor number and delay megakaryocytic maturation of human umbilical cord CD34+ cells cultured in thrombopoietin (42Fichelson S.

Blood. 1999; 94: 1601-1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it can inhibit DNA polyploidization of murine bone marrow CD41+ cells cultured in thrombopoietin (43Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Raf-1 and B-Raf are shown to be required for thrombopoietin-induced sustained ERK1/2 activation, which itself is required for thrombopoietin-induced megakaryocytic maturation (44Garcia J. de Gunzburg J. Eychene A. Gisselbrecht S. Porteu F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). From these observations, we speculate that Spred-1 as well as Spred-2 regulate proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic lineages by modulating ERK activity. This is supported by the fact that a marked increase in the number of megakaryocytes was observed in the spleen of Spred-2-deficient mice (18Nobuhisa I. Kato R. Inoue H. Takizawa M. Okita K. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as well as Spred-1-deficient mice. 3R. Kato, unpublished data. We also observed enhanced colony formation in Spred-1-deficient BM cells.2 Rapid proliferation of Spred-1-deficient BMMCs and Ba/F3 cells expressing ΔC-Spred-1 in response to IL-3 also supports our hypothesis. Further investigation using knockout mice is under way to define which lineages of hematopoiesis and which cytokines Spreds regulate. If our hypothesis is also true in hematopoietic stem cells, inhibition of Spred function or suppression of expression of Spreds may be useful methods for the expansion of stem cells. We have shown that Spred-1 interacts with Ras and Raf, thereby suppressing Raf-1 phosphorylation (10Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We confirmed suppression of Raf-1 activation by Spred-1 using Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 4C) and Spred-1-/- BMMCs (Fig. 6B). Spred-1 seems to be a general inhibitor for the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway, which is consistent with Spred-1 being able to suppress not only growth factor-induced but also cytokine-induced ERK activation. Although Sproutys are suggested to be selective inhibitors of ERK activation, we and others have shown that Sprouty-4 inhibits FGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced, but not EGF-induced, ERK activation (6Sasaki A. Taketomi T. Kato R. Saeki K. Nonami A. Sasaki M. Kuriyama M. Saito N. Shibuya M. Yoshimura A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 20Sasaki A. Taketomi T. Wakioka T. Kato R. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36804-36808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this selective suppression by Sproutys has not been clarified. Sproutys are also tyrosine-phosphorylated like Spred-1, and multiple mechanisms of suppression such as recruiting SHP-2 or Cbl are proposed (45Christofori G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is also not clear whether Sprouty and Spreds regulate signaling pathways other than ERK. In this context, we observed that overexpression of WT Spred-1 has a much more dramatic effect on IL-3- and SCF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation than does expression of ΔC-Spred-1 at short term stimulation (Fig. 4, B and C). This suggests a possibility of the effect of ΔC-Spred-1 on other signaling pathways. However, when we compared steady state phosphorylation levels of ERK (Fig. 4A), we found a more drastic effect of ΔC-Spred-1 on ERK activation. Therefore, a long term accumulation of enhanced ERK activation by ΔC-Spred-1 may contribute to the rapid proliferation of ΔC-Spred-1-infected cells. However, Xenopus Sprouty2 is shown to be an intracellular antagonist of FGF-dependent calcium signaling (46Nutt S.L. Dingwell K.S. Holt C.E. Amaya E. Genes. Dev. 2001; 15: 1152-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others showed that Spreds and Sproutys inhibit cell migration, probably by suppressing Rho activation (29Lee C.C. Putnam A.J. Miranti C.K. Gustafson M. Wang L.M. Vande Woude G.F. Gao C.F. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5193-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 47Miyoshi K. Wakioka T. Nishinakamura H. Kamio M. Yang L. Inoue M. Hasegawa M. Yonemitsu Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Spred-1 interacted with Rho but not cdc42 and Rac and inhibits Rho-kinase activation (47Miyoshi K. Wakioka T. Nishinakamura H. Kamio M. Yang L. Inoue M. Hasegawa M. Yonemitsu Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that Spred-1-deficient BMMCs can proliferate much faster than WT-BMMCs as ΔC-Spred-1 infected Ba/F3 cells. However, we noticed that such a rapid proliferation is dependent on culture periods. The difference in growth rate between WT and Spred-1-/- BMMC became small after more than 2 months of culture in IL-3, although Spred-1 was still expressed in WT-BMMCs and ERK activation was enhanced in Spred-1-/- BMMCs (data not shown). These cannot be explained by ERK alone, and we speculate that signaling pathways other than ERK also be affected by Spred-1 in hematopoietic cells. Further investigation is necessary to define the precise roles of Spred-1 on cytokine signal transduction. We thank Y. Kawabata and M. Takeuchi for technical assistance and N. Arifuku and F.

https://openalex.org/W2123710353,"Chordin-like cysteine-rich (CR) repeats (also referred to as von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) modules) have been identified in ∼200 extracellular matrix proteins. These repeats, named on the basis of amino acid conservation of 10 cysteine residues, have been shown to bind members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and are proposed to regulate growth factor signaling. Here we describe the intramolecular disulfide bonding, solution structure, and dynamics of a prototypical chordin-like CR repeat from procollagen IIA (CRColIIA), which has been previously shown to bind TGF-β1 and bone morphogenetic protein-2. The CRColIIA structure manifests a two sub-domain architecture tethered by a flexible linkage. Initial structures were calculated using RosettaNMR, a de novo prediction method, and final structure calculations were performed using CANDID within CYANA. The N-terminal region contains mainly β-sheet and the C-terminal region is more irregular with the fold constrained by disulfide bonds. Mobility between the N- and C-terminal sub-domains on a fast timescale was confirmed using NMR relaxation measurements. We speculate that the mobility between the two sub-domains may decrease upon ligand binding. Structure and sequence comparisons have revealed an evolutionary relationship between the N-terminal sub-domain of the CR module and the fibronectin type 1 domain, suggesting that these domains share a common ancestry. Based on the previously reported mapping of fibronectin binding sites for vascular endothelial growth factor to regions containing fibronectin type 1 domains, we discuss the possibility that this structural homology might also have functional relevance.

These repeats, also known as von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domains (1Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), are ∼60–80 amino acids in length and are mainly defined by a consensus sequence of 10 cysteines (available at www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF00093 and smart.embl-heidelberg.de/smart/do_annotation.pl?BLAST=DUMMY&DOMAIN=VWC). Typically a conserved glycine and an aromatic residue, often tryptophan, are found between the first pair of cysteine residues. The motifs C2XXC3XC4 and C8C9XXC10, located in the middle and at the C-terminal end of the repeat, are also highly conserved (see Fig. 1). The BMPs, members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of proteins, induce bone and cartilage formation, control skeletal patterning and left-right asymmetry, and are important in the development of organs, including the kidney, lung, and teeth (reviewed in Refs. 2Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar and 3Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The BMP antagonist activity of chordin has been localized to the CR repeats (4Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of BMP activity by chordin is essential for dorsal-ventral patterning in Xenopus (5Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. DeRobertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) and for mammalian embryonic patterning (6Bachiller D. Klingensmith J. Kemp C. Belo J.A. Anderson R.M. May S.R. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Harland R.M. Rossant J. DeRobertis E.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 658-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) (and reviewed in Ref. 7Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Chordin-like CR repeats have been identified in ∼200 extracellular proteins (available at www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF00093) and therefore represent one of, if not the most, commonly occurring protein modules of hitherto unknown structure. Other proteins besides chordin containing CR repeats include von Willebrand factor (VWC), connective tissue growth factor, thrombospondins, and procollagen type IIA (ColIIA) (reviewed in Ref. 8Garcia Abreu J. Coffinier C. Larrain J. Oelgeschlager M. DeRobertis E.M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 287: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These repeats bind to a range of TGF-β superfamily members, and perhaps their ligand specificities differ due to their divergent sequences (Fig. 1). For example, BMP-4 binds with higher affinity to chordin repeats CR-1 and CR-3 than to CR-2 and CR-4 (4Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the CR repeat of connective tissue growth factor binds BMP-4 and TGF-β1 (9Abreu J.G. Ketpura N.I. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), and neuralin/chordin-like protein binds BMP-4, -5, and -6 and TGF-β1 and -β2 (10Nakayama N. Han C.Y.E. Scully S. Nishinakamura R. He C. Zeni L. Yamane H. Chang D. Yu D.Y. Yokota T. Wen D.Z. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 372-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has also been observed that the activity of intact chordin, containing all four repeats, is 5- to 10-fold higher than that of the individual domains (4Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, it has been proposed that the general function of chordin-like CR repeats is to regulate signaling by members of the TGF-β superfamily in the extracellular matrix and that avidity may also be important (8Garcia Abreu J. Coffinier C. Larrain J. Oelgeschlager M. DeRobertis E.M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 287: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Here we describe the solution structure and dynamics of a prototypical chordin-like CR repeat from procollagen type IIA (CRColIIA). Collagen II, like the other fibrillar collagens, is expressed as a procollagen with both N- and C-terminal propeptides. Type II procollagen is synthesized in two alternatively spliced forms, IIA and IIB, both of which assemble as trimeric coiled-coils. Procollagen type IIA (ColIIA) is expressed by pre-chondrogenic cells, and during chondrogenesis mRNA synthesis switches to type IIB. Only type IIB is expressed by mature chondrocytes in normal articular cartilage. However, type IIA is re-expressed in osteoarthritic tissue and has been proposed to be a marker for osteoarthritis (11Aigner T. Zhu Y. Chansky H.H. Matsen 3rd, F.A. Maloney W.J. Sandell L.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1443-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The difference between procollagens IIA and IIB at the mRNA level is the presence of an additional exon (exon 2) in type IIA, which encodes for a 69-amino acid chordin-like CR repeat in the amino propeptide (12Ryan M.C. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10334-10339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sandell L.J. Nalin A.M. Reife R.A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of ColIIA suggests it is important during development. ColIIA is expressed in pre-chondrogenic cartilage (14Oganesian A. Zhu Y. Sandell L.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and in the notochord (13Sandell L.J. Nalin A.M. Reife R.A. Dev.

ColIIA is also used as a marker for identifying dorsal regions during Xenopus development (23Su M.W. Suzuki H.R. Bieker J.J. Solursh M. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Full-length ColIIA mRNA has dorsalizing activity in Xenopus (4Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that, like chordin, it acts as a BMP antagonist. In common with other CR repeat-containing proteins, ColIIA interacts with proteins of the TGF-β superfamily and therefore potentially regulates growth factor signaling during development. The isolated CRColIIA repeat binds BMP-2 and TGF-β1 in solid phase binding assays (24Zhu Y. Oganesian A. Keene D.R. Sandell L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and in coimmunoprecipitation assays, binding to BMP-4 is competed by BMP-2 and TGF-β1 (4Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here we present a prototypical structure of a chordin-like CR repeat from procollagen type IIA. Structure determination on the basis of solution NMR data was facilitated by the use of RosettaNMR (25Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), a de novo prediction method that enables identification of a protein fold on the basis of limited NMR data and assignments. Final structures were calculated using the semi-automated CYANA algorithm (26Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Unusually, the module manifests a two sub-domain architecture. Mobility between the N- and C-terminal regions was confirmed by NMR relaxation data analysis. The N-terminal sub-domain is well structured and predominantly of β-sheet configuration. The C-terminal sub-domain is less regular, and the fold is constrained by disulfide bonds. The solution of this structure has revealed an unexpected structural relationship between chordin-like CR repeats and fibronectin type 1 (FN1) domains suggesting that the FN1 domain has evolved as a truncation of a CR repeat. The binding sites for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a TGF-β structural homologue, map to N- and C-terminal fragments of fibronectin (27Goerges A.L. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Wijelath E.S. Murray J. Rahman S. Patel Y. Ishida A. Strand K. Aziz S. Cardona C. Hammond W.P. Savidge G.F. Rafii S. Sobel M. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which correspond to the regions containing FN1 domains. Therefore this research raises the possibility that FN1 domains and CR repeats may form similar complexes with cysteine-knot family cytokines.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—The chordin-like CR repeat from human procollagen type IIA (CRColIIA, residues Gln29-Ser97, TrEMBL accession number Q14047) was expressed recombinantly in the yeast Pichia pastoris using previously described methods (29O'Leary J.M. Radcliffe C. Willis A.C. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M. Downing A.K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was expressed in-frame with the α-factor secretion signal sequence in the vector pPIC9K (Invitrogen), which resulted in an additional four residues (YVEF) being appended to the N terminus. At the C terminus, three residues (Thr91, Thr95, and Ser97) were mutated to alanines to remove sites of O-mannosylation, an artifact of the expression system; the domain is not glycosylated by the native host. 15N-CRColIIA was prepared using [15N]ammonium sulfate as the sole nitrogen source; for 15N,13C-CRColIIA the carbon sources were [13C6-d-UL]glucose in the cell growth medium (buffered minimal glucose) and [13C]methanol (>99 Atom%) in the expression medium (buffered minimal methanol). The protein was initially purified by anion exchange and reverse phase chromatography. Non-covalently associated carbohydrates that co-purified with the protein were removed using lectin affinity chromatography, and CRColIIA was isolated by reverse phase chromatography. The protein was characterized by N-terminal sequencing, amino acid analysis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry.NMR Data Acquisition—NMR data were acquired on GE Omega/home-built spectrometers operating at 600 or 750 MHz. The spectrometers were fitted with triple resonance triaxial gradient probes with self-shielded pulsed field gradients. Spectra were acquired at 25 °C unless stated otherwise. Acquisition parameters for experiments are given in Table I. Three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and NOESY-HSQC (30Kay L.E. Marion D. Bax A. J. Magn.

The mixing time for NOESY spectra used for assignment and structure calculation (three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC and two-dimensional 1H NOESY) was 150 ms. To determine the disulfide bond connectivity of the CRColIIA module, 2D-NOESY experiments with 250-ms mixing time were acquired at 15, 25, and 35 °C at 750 MHz.

These data were used in the assignment of 2D-NOESY spectra.Table INMR data acquisition parametersSample conditionsExperimentSpectral frequencyComplex pointsAcquisition timeD1D2D3F3F2F1MHzms15N-CRColIIA1H-15N HSQC750204864102.460.025 °C1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC, tmix 48 ms750204832128102.47.56.41H-15N NOESY-HSQC, tmix 150 ms750204832128102.47.56.415N-CRColIIA1H-1H TOCSY, tmix 53 ms7502048720102.436.025 °C1H-1H NOESY, tmix 150 ms7502048720102.436.099.9% 2H2O1H-1H COSY7502048700102.435.015N-CRColIIA1H-1H NOESY, tmix 250 ms7501024650102.432.515, 25, 35 °C, 99.9% 2H2OHNCA600512709651.217.510.715N,13C-CRColIIAHN(CO)CA600512649651.216.010.725 °CHNCO600102458128102.411.621.4HCCH-TOCSY6005126025051.22.420.815N,13C-CRColIIA1H-13C NOESY-HSQC7505122564651.23.030.725 °C99.9% 2H2Otmix 250 ms15N-CRColIIAGrs3e (spin state selective excitation)7502048192102.444.925, 35 °C5% (v/v) ether lipid bicelles Open table in a new tab All spectra were processed using Felix97 (Accelerys, San Diego, CA) typically using a Gaussian line-broadening window function in the acquisition dimension, with -15 and 0.15 line broadening and Gaussian parameters, respectively, and a 70°-shifted squared sine-bell window function in the indirect dimension(s). HMQC-J and COSY spectra were typically processed with a 0°-shifted sine bell window function in the dimension(s) sensitive to J-couplings. Spectra were zero-filled as necessary to improve resolution, and linear prediction (44Zhu G. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 405-410Google Scholar) was used to double the number of complex points in the F2 (15N) dimension of the HSQC and three-dimensional data sets.3JHNHα coupling constants were measured from line-shape fitting F1 traces from an HMQC-J spectrum (45Kay L.E. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 86: 110-126Google Scholar) recorded with acquisition times of 102.4 ms in the direct 1H dimension and 222.3 ms for 475 complex points in the 15N dimension. The spectrum was zero-filled to increase the digital resolution in F1 to 1.04 Hz/point. In addition, Hα, Cα, Cβ, C′, and N chemical shifts for the CRColIIA module were used to predict phi (φ) and psi (Ψ) backbone torsion angles using TALOS (46Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). For this study, angle constraints were only accepted if (i) the TALOS prediction was rated as “good,” (ii) heteronuclear NOE data suggested that the residue was ordered, and (iii) the prediction was consistent with HMQC-J data. Constraints were implemented using the values for the torsion angles output by TALOS ± 30°. A total of 69 backbone torsion angle constraints were used in structure calculations.A series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra (45Kay L.E. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 86: 110-126Google Scholar) was acquired on a sample freshly dissolved in 2H2O to identify slowly exchanging amides. Amides that had not exchanged after 24 h and were located in regions of defined secondary structure based on the NOE data were restrained to form HN–CO hydrogen bonds using the distance restraints dO-N = 3.3 Å and dO-HN = 2.3 Å. For structure calculations, 28 restraints were used for 14 backbone hydrogen bonds.Relaxation data for CRColIIA were acquired at 25 °C and 600 MHz as described previously (47Werner J.M. Knott V. Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1065-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The sample contained 0.72 mm CRColIIA, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 10% (v/v) 2H2O, and 0.02% (v/v) sodium azide. To check for protein aggregation, T2 measurements were also made on a sample containing 0.36 mm protein in the same buffer. In the 15N-T1, 15N-T2 and heteronuclear NOE experiments (48Farrow N.A. Zhang O.W. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) the acquisition times were 128 ms (1H) and 37.5 ms (15N). The Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill delay in the T2 experiment was set to 250 μs. Relaxation delays were 40, 80, 120, 160, 400, 600, 1000, and 1600 ms and 8, 16, 32, 48, 80, 120, 160, 180, and 320 ms for the T1 and the T2 series, respectively. T1 and T2 relaxation time constants were derived from two-parameter exponential fits to the intensity decays, and errors were estimated from the root mean square noise in the spectra. Pairs of 2D 1H-detected [1H]-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments were acquired with 1H saturation achieved in the experiment with NOE by a train of 120° flip-angle 1H pulses at 5-ms intervals for 3 s. The [1H]-15N NOE was calculated as the ratio of the peak volumes in the experiments with and without proton saturation. The relaxation data were analyzed using NMRView (49Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar).Spectral Assignment—Sequence-specific 1H and 15N chemical shift assignments were made using conventional methods (50Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 51Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. II I Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar) with the program NMRView 5.0 (49Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar). Backbone sequential assignments were made using 3D 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC, 3D 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC, HNCA, and HN(CO)CA experiments (see Ref. 51Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. II I Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). Side-chain assignments were extended with 2D NOESY and TOCSY data and confirmed where possible using 3D HCCH-TOCSY and 13C-edited NOESY data.De Novo Prediction of CRColIIA Backbone Fold—1H-15N residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured in 5% w/v ether bicelle lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) using spin-state selective excitation (52Meissner A. Duus J.O. Sorensen O.W. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) at 750 MHz. The range of couplings used for RDC analyses was 32.4 to -20.1 Hz. Values for Da (16.2 Hz) and R (0.15) were calculated from the RDC data based on the histogram of RDCs and Dx, Dy, and Dz values of -12.6, -19.8, and 32.4 Hz, respectively (53Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 133: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). No large chemical shift perturbations nor changes in line shape were observed on orienting the sample; these observations and the relatively low rhombicity calculated from the RDC data are consistent with a steric interaction of the peptide with the bicelles. Heteronuclear [1H]-15N NOE data were used to determine which RDCs to use in RosettaNMR calculations (25Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the absence of generalized order parameters, an RDC was deemed reliable if the ratio of peak intensities with and without the steady-state heteronuclear NOE was >0.6.The RosettaNMR algorithm was implemented as described previously (25Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with a number of modifications. Fragments were generated using the Robetta server (54Chivian D. Kim D.E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W526-W531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) with near complete C′, Cα, Cβ, Hα, and N chemical shift information and 35 (HN-HA, HA-HA, and HN-HN) long-range NOEs as input data. All NOE distance constraints were set to 5 Å. The experimentally determined disulfide bonds were included in the form of 5-Å HA-HA NOE constraints. This distance was selected based on the manual analysis of four high resolution (≤2.50 Å) crystal structures of disulfide bonded proteins (56Crennell S. Takimoto T. Portner A. Taylor G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 57Diao J.S. Wan Z.L. Chang W.R. Liang D.C.

Sequence homologues were not removed from the data base prior to fragment selection to obtain a set that would better represent the target structure. Secondary structure prediction results from PHD (60Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar) and PSIPRED (61McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2663) Google Scholar) were confirmed and supplemented with backbone torsion angle constraints derived from analysis of HMQC-J data and TALOS (46Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). Including a single type of RDC from one alignment medium was expected to reduce the precision of the fragments due to the degeneracy of the RDC, so RDC data were only included when folding the protein.RosettaNMR simulations from random seeds were performed using chemical shift information and NOEs and 43 1H-15N RDCs as described previously (25Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Due to the high density of disulfide bonds in the CRColIIA repeat, the standard RosettaNMR algorithm was supplemented with the find_disulf flag. This detects possible disulfide bridges, removes the repulsive energy that might result from the formation of these bonds, and adds a score based on their geometry to the total RosettaNMR scoring function. For the final structures, 20,000 simulations were performed and the 10 lowest energy structures were refined according to previously described methods (25Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Structure Calculation—The NMRView sequence, chemical shift, and cross-peak files were converted to XEASY format using the CCPN format converter v1.0b1. 2W.

It is not fully understood whether the LCR acts over the long distance by a looping mechanism in which the LCR complex (the LCR DNA and its associated transcription factors) loops over the intervening DNA to directly interact with the globin promoters or by a tracking mechanism in which the LCR complex or its protein components track along the intervening DNA to reach and activate the downstream promoters (4Bulger M.

In plasmids integrated into erythroid cells, this genetropic HS2 enhancer transcription, like HS2 enhancer function, is detected regardless of the orientation, position, and distance of the enhancer relative to the cis-linked promoter and gene (15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, splitting the HS2 enhancer at the enhancer core, thereby preventing assembly of the intact enhancer complex, diminishes both enhancer transcription at the enhancer site and mRNA synthesis at the promoter site (14Tuan D. Kong S. Hu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11219-11223Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the enhancer-initiated transcription plays a role in mediating enhancer function. To investigate the contribution of a transcription mechanism to HS2 enhancer function, here we interrupted the enhancer-initiated transcription process with a transcriptional terminator and studied the subsequent effects on enhancer function. We chose the lac operator/repressor (lacO/R) complex of the bacterial lac operon (18Gilbert W. CIBA Found. Symp. 1972; 7: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar) to serve as the transcriptional terminator for this study because of the following considerations: (i) the Lac repressor protein (lacR) binds to the lac operator sequence (lacO) with extremely high specificity and affinity (19Riggs A. Bourgeois S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). (ii) The lacR bound at the lacO sequence in the lac operon interacts with RNA polymerase and blocks transcriptional elongation without inhibiting transcriptional initiation (20Lee J. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1991; 66: 793-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). (iii) The lacR protein can recognize and bind with high affinity to the lacO sequence packaged into nucleosomes (21Chao M. Gralla J. Martinson H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3254-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). (iv) In recombinant plasmids integrated into the eukaryotic genomes, the lacO/R complex blocks mRNA elongation both when it is inserted near the promoter (22Hu M. Davidson N. Cell. 1987; 48: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23Brown M. Figge J. Hansen U. Wright C Heang K.-T. Khoury G. Livingston D. Roberts T. Cell. 1987; 49: 603-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and when it is inserted in the intron of a gene far downstream of the promoter (24Deuschle U. Hipskind R. Bujard H. Science. 1990; 248: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). (v) Repression by lacO/R complex in eukaryotic cells can be reversed by dissociating the complex with IPTG (22Hu M. Davidson N. Cell. 1987; 48: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23Brown M. Figge J. Hansen U. Wright C Heang K.-T. Khoury G. Livingston D. Roberts T.

We constructed the HS2-lac-1.2-ϵp-CAT-lac test plasmid, which contained the lacO sequence inserted between the HS2 enhancer and the 1.2-kb DNA located naturally downstream of the HS2 enhancer in the genome (see Fig. 2A), the ϵ-globin promoter, and the bacterial chloramphenical acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene. To more closely mimic the endogenous globin gene locus, we also constructed the HS2-lac-1.2-5.5-ϵp-GFP test plasmid, which contained an additional 5.5 kb of intervening DNA that is contiguous with the ϵ-globin promoter in the genome and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. The test plasmids and the respective reference plasmids that did not contain the interposed lacO sequence were integrated into an erythroid K562 cell line that expressed a steady level of the lacR protein. The effects of the interposed lacO/R complex on synthesis of the enhancer-initiated, intergenic RNAs and of the CAT or GFP mRNA were determined by RT-PCR, RNase protection assay (RPA), and Northern blot. The levels of CAT and GFP proteins were determined by CAT enzymatic assays and FACS analysis of the green fluorescence emitted by GFP in the transfected cells. The results indicate that the interposed lacO/R complex blocked transcriptional elongation of the enhancer-assembled transcription machinery through the intervening DNA into the ϵ-globin promoter and drastically reduced the level of mRNA synthesis at the ϵ-globin promoter. We discuss the tracking and transcription mechanism of the enhancer-assembled transcription machinery in mediating long range enhancer function. Construction of Plasmids—The HS2-lac-1.2-ϵp-CAT-lac plasmid was created as follows. An oligonucleotide, StuI-(lacO)2-SnaBI-BamHI, containing two tandem natural lacO sequences was inserted into the StuI and BglII sites at the 3′-end of HS2 in HS2-1.2-ϵp-CAT (15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to make the HS2-lac-1.2-ϵp-CAT plasmid. To make the final HS2-lac-1.2-ϵp-CAT-lac plasmid, an XbaI-StuI-(lacO)2-BamHI oligonucleotide was inserted into the XbaI and BamHI sites downstream of the CAT gene in an enhancerless ϵp-CAT plasmid (15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); a PstI-HpaI fragment spanning the lacO sequence was excised from this plasmid and inserted into the HS2-lac-1.2-ϵp-CAT plasmid similarly cleaved with PstI and HpaI to remove the equivalent DNA downstream of the CAT gene. The lac-HS2-1.2-ϵp-CAT-lac reference plasmid was created as follows: the XbaI-(lacO)2-BamHI oligonucleotide inserted in the polycloning sites of pUC19 was excised by AlwnI and SmaI digestions and inserted into the AlwnI and NruI sites located 300 bp upstream of HS2 in HS2-1.2-ϵp-CAT; the (lacO)2 sequence downstream of the CAT gene was similarly inserted as in the test plasmid. The 5′ → 3′ sequence of (lacO)2 was AGATCTAGAAGGCCT [GGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATT][TGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATT] ACGTATACGGATCC. The DNA of 40 bases within the brackets are the natural lac operator sequence (18Gilbert W. CIBA Found. Symp. 1972; 7: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar) repeated in tandem; underlined bases are respectively XbaI, StuI, SnaBI and BamHI sites used in cloning. To conserve the 10-bp helical phasing of HS2 with respect to the downstream 1.2 kb DNA, the inserted (lacO)2 between StuI and BamHI sites spanned 55 bases and replaced the 35 bases of DNA between the StuI and BglII sites in the natural HS2. The HS2-1.2-5.5-ϵp-GFP reference plasmid was made from the pEGFP-C1 vector plasmid (Clontech). First, the cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter was removed from the pEGFP by AseI and NheI digestions, and the HS2-1.2-ϵp DNA with XhoI and NheI ends made by PCR from the HS2-1.2-ϵp-CAT plasmid was inserted with an AseI-XhoI adaptor into the AseI-NheI-digested pEGFP to make the HS2-1.2-ϵp-GFP plasmid. The plasmid was then cleaved with ScaI and BamHI located within the last 10 bases of the 1.2 kb DNA into which the 5.5-kb PCR DNA with ScaI and BamHI ends was inserted to make the HS2-1.2-5.5-ϵp-GFP plasmid. The HS2-lac-1.2-5.5-ϵp-GFP test plasmid was made by inserting the StuI-(lacO)2-BamHI oligonucleotide into the StuI and BglII sites at the 3′-end of HS2 in HS2-1.2-ϵp-GFP plasmid. The 5.5-kb DNA was inserted as in the reference plasmid. To adapt to the above cloning strategies, the pEGFP vector was modified as follows. (i) To prevent the downstream SV40 enhancer from activating the GFP gene, the SV40 enhancer/promoter driving the kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene downstream of the GFP gene was deleted by SspI-StuI digestions; the vector was then recircularized by blunt-end ligation. (ii) To provide splice signals for the GFP gene, the 244-bp PCR fragment spanning the SV40 intron of 66 bp in the pCAT plasmid (Promega, Ref. 39Promega (1989) Bulletin 80, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar) was inserted into the EcoRI and SalI sites in the multicloning site 3′ of the GFP gene. (iii) The BamHI site in the multicloning site was eliminated by BamHI cleavage, end filling, and recircularization of the vector plasmid. Creation of (+R) K562 Clonal Cell Line Expressing a Steady Level of the lac Repressor and Generation of Cell Clones and Pools of (+R) K562 or (-R) K562 Harboring the Integrated Test or Reference CAT or GFP Plasmids—To create the (+R) K562 clonal cell line, the pCMVLacI plasmid (Stratagene) containing the lacR gene tagged with a nuclear localization signal and the hygromycin selectable marker gene was transfected into K562 cells. Several clonal lines were expanded from single, parental cells, and the line that expressed the highest steady level of the lac repressor was selected. The test or the reference CAT and GFP plasmids were then separately integrated into this (+R) cell line or the wild type (-R) K562 cells with a cotransfected pCD neoplasmid expressing the neomycin resistance gene (15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To obtain multiple copy integrants yet avoiding tandem integration of the plasmids, a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method (15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used: first, the CAT plasmids were linearized at the unique AlwnI site in the vector downstream of the CAT gene, and the GFP-plasmids were linearized at the unique MluI site between the GFP and the downstream kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene. Ten μg of the linearized plasmid and 0.3 μg of the pCDneo plasmid were mixed with 20 μg of spacer DNA-K562 genomic DNA fragmented to an average of 5-10 kb by sonication (CAT-plasmids) or by MluI, BtgI, and AflIII cleavages and sonication (GFP-plasmids). The plasmid DNAs would thus be integrated into the K562 genome not in tandem but interspersed with the spacer DNAs. Cell pools and clonal lines were expanded in medium containing hygromycin and G418. Modes of integration and copy numbers of the integrated plasmids were determined by Southern blots as described (15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Supplemental Fig. S1). For IPTG induction, the cells were grown in medium containing 20 mm IPTG for 4-7 days. Western Blot and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—For Western blots, 20 μg of protein from (-R) and (+R) K562 cell lysates were resolved in 5-15% gradient SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were soaked in blocking buffer: 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated with anti-LacI antibody (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. The membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h. The labeled lac repressor band was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). The EMSA reactions (10 μl) contained 2-4 μg of nuclear extract and 40-50 fmol of 32P-labeled probe as described (25Ramchandran R. Bengra C. Whitney B. Lanclos K. Tuan D. Am. J. Hematol. 2000; 65: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For antibody supershift, 2 μl of the lacR antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) was added prior to the addition of the probe. The reactions were resolved in 5% non-denaturing PAGE. The gels were dried and analyzed in a PhosphorImager. CAT Assays and FACS Analysis of GFP—Quantitative CAT enzymatic assays were carried out as described (15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with modified conditions. To ensure that the acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol reaction product was linearly proportional to the CAT enzyme present in the added cell extract, the CAT assays contained an excess of the [14C]chloramphenicol substrate. To achieve this, the percentage conversion of the substrate to the product at the end of the assay reactions was kept within 10-50% range of the substrate. Quantitative analyses of GFP fluorescence levels in live cells harboring the integrated test or reference GFP-plasmids were carried out in a FACS Calibur with Cellquest program (BD Biosciences) as described (26Ling J. Pi W. Bollag R. Zeng S. Keskintepe M. Saliman H. Krantz S. Whitney B. Tuan D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To calculate the CAT enzyme or GFP level per copy of the integrated plasmid, the per cell copy numbers of the integrated plasmids were determined by either Southern blot or PCR (15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Ling J. Pi W. Bollag R. Zeng S. Keskintepe M. Saliman H. Krantz S. Whitney B. Tuan D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation, Semiquantitative RT-PCR, Real-time RT-PCR, and RPAs—Total cellular RNAs were isolated from K562 cells by the Trizol kit (Invitrogen). After treatment with RNase-free DNase I, the RNAs were used in RT-PCR (27Ling J. Pi W. Yu X. Bengra C. Long Q. Jin H. Seyfang A. Tuan D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4582-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and RPA (15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as described. In semiquantitative RT-PCR (see Supplemental Fig. S2), random hexamer primers were used for synthesis of master stocks of cDNAs from the respective RNA templates. Aliquots of the cDNA master stocks derived from 0.2 μg of RNA template were then separately amplified with different PCR primer pairs in 50 μl of final volume for 28-30 cycles. The β-actin mRNA amplified by a β-actin primer pair (Stratagene) or the endogenous ϵ-globin mRNA amplified by an appropriate primer pair served as the internal quantitative control as described previously (26Ling J. Pi W. Bollag R. Zeng S. Keskintepe M. Saliman H. Krantz S. Whitney B. Tuan D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR bands were quantified relative to the β-actin internal control band with an IS1000 Digital Imager (Alpha Innotech). Real-time RT-PCR was carried out in a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) using the SYBR Green Master kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the vendor's protocol. The PCR conditions were: 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. Quantification of the real-time RT-PCR products was calculated from the PCR cycle number at the initiation of the log-linear phase of amplification by the Fit Points program. PCR Primers—For the reference and test plasmids HS2-1.2- and HS2-lac-1.2 ϵp-CAT plasmids (see Fig. 2B and Table I), the respective forward and reverse primers in primer pair 1: GGAAGCAGCCCAGTAGGTTGA (in pA10CAT2), 8747-8771 (U01317) in HS2; in primer pair 2: 10096-10115 (U01317), CAT 2348-2328 (Promega, Ref. 39Promega (1989) Bulletin 80, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar); in primer pair 3: CAT 2941-2961, CAT 3336-3316 (Promega, Ref. 39Promega (1989) Bulletin 80, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar).

Pi W. Yu X. Bengra C. Long Q. Jin H. Seyfang A. Tuan D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4582-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Radioactive intensities of the RNA bands were quantified with a PhosphorImager. (+R) K562 Cell Line Expresses the lac Repressor Protein within the Cell Nucleus—The (+R) K562 clonal cell line was created to ensure that the test and the reference plasmids were integrated into (+R) cells expressing an identical level of the lacR protein. To confirm that the integrated lacR expression plasmid indeed expressed the lacR protein, we carried out Western blot analysis of proteins isolated from (+R) and (-R) K562. The result showed that in the (+R) K562 cell line, the lacR antibody detected a protein band of 38 Kd corresponding to the monomeric molecular weight of the lacR protein (18Gilbert W. CIBA Found. Symp. 1972; 7: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar), whereas (-R) K562 cells did not produce this band (Fig. 1A, lanes (+R) and (-R)). To further confirm that the lacR with the nuclear localization signal was transported into the nucleus and could bind to the lacO sequence, we carried out EMSA with (+R) and (-R) K562 nuclear extracts. The result showed that the (+R) K562 nuclear extract produced a strong EMSA band of the lacO/R complex (Fig. 1B, lane 3); this band was abolished by 100× excess of the unlabeled lacO sequence, and it was almost completely abolished by the lacR antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 4). The presence of a faint EMSA band that remained after removal of lacR with the antibody (Fig. 2B, lane 4) indicated that in the absence of lacR protein, the lacO sequence could bind weakly to endogenous nuclear protein(s) in K562 cells. Consistent with this interpretation, the (-R) K562 nuclear extract produced a faint EMSA band with the lacO probe (Fig. 2B, lane 2). The results indicate that in the absence of lacR in (-R) nuclear extract or in (+R) nuclear extract treated with lacR antibody, the lacO sequence could bind with weak affinity to an endogenous K562 nuclear protein. However, in the presence of lacR in (+R) K562 cells the lacO sequence bound to lacR with high affinity to form the lacO/R complex in the cell nucleus. The lacO/R Complex Inserted between the HS2 Enhancer and the ϵ-Globin Promoter Blocks Elongation of Enhancer-initiated Transcription through the Intervening DNA into the Promoter and Drastically Reduces HS2 Enhancer Activity—To determine the significance of the HS2 enhancer-initiated transcription in enhancer function, we constructed the HS2-lac-1.2-ϵp-CAT-lac test plasmid containing the 0.74-kb HS2 enhancer, the 40 bp lacO, and the 1.2-kb intervening DNA located naturally downstream of HS2 in the genome (Fig. 2A, top) coupled to the ϵ-globin promoter and the bacterial CAT gene. In this plasmid, the lacO sequence was inserted at a position 0.5 kb from the HS2 enhancer core and 1.2 kb from the ϵ-globin promoter so that the interposed lacO/R complex would block transcriptional elongation of the enhancer-assembled transcriptional machinery but would not interfere with initiation of RNA synthesis from the enhancer core and mRNA synthesis from the ϵ-globin promoter. To prevent the host genome from interfering with transcription of the CAT gene, an additional lacO sequence was inserted downstream of the CAT gene in the test plasmid (Fig. 2A). In the reference plasmid, lac-HS2-1.2-ϵp-CAT-lac, the lacO sequence inserted downstream of HS2 in the test plasmid was moved to the vector sequence at a position 0.3 kb upstream of HS2 (Fig. 2A). The test and the reference plasmids were separately integrated into (+R) or (-R) K562 cells. To prevent tandem integration of the plasmids such that the HS2 enhancer in one plasmid could activate transcription of the CAT gene in the upstream, neighboring plasmid, the plasmids were co-integrated with fragmented K562 spacer DNAs by a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method (Ref. 15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, see “Materials and Methods”). Both cell pools and clonal lines were expanded from the transfected cells. Southern blots of the integrated plasmids in clonal lines indicate that the plasmids were integrated not in tandem copies into single host sites but mainly in single copies into multiple host sites (see Supplemental Fig. S1, Ref. 15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the interposed lac O/R complex on the transcriptional status of the transgene cassette, total cellular RNAs were isolated from (-R) and (+R) cell pools containing the integrated test or the reference plasmids. The RNAs were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR with three primer pairs spanning, respectively, the HS2 enhancer, the 1.2-ϵp intervening DNA, and the CAT gene in the plasmids (primer pairs 1-3, Fig. 2A). Note that to differentiate the HS2 RNAs transcribed from the plasmids from those transcribed from the endogenous HS2 in the K562 genome, the forward primer for primer pair 1 was located in the vector sequence immediately upstream of HS2 (Fig. 2A). This was possible because RPA studies showed that the HS2 enhancer was able to activate transcription from the immediately upstream vector DNA (Fig. 3, Ref. 15Kong S. Bohl D. Li C. Tuan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In (-R) K562 cells, the interposed lacO sequence in the test plasmid did not inhibit initiation of transcription at the enhancer or synthesis of CAT mRNA at the ϵ-globin promoter because the intensities of the RT-PCR bands amplified by primer pairs 1, 2, and 3 in the test and the reference plasmids were comparable (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-3 in agarose gel and the bar graph below, (-R) panel,). In (+R) K562 cells, the levels of HS2 RNAs transcribed from the test and the reference plasmids were again comparable (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, (+R) panel). This indicates that the lacO/R complex located 0.5 kb downstream of the HS2 enhancer in the test plasmid or the lacO/R complex located 0.3 kb upstream of the HS2 enhancer in the reference plasmid did not interfere with initiation of RNA synthesis from the HS2 enhancer. In contrast, the intergenic RNA transcribed from the 1.2-kb DNA and the ϵ-globin promoter was drastically reduced by the interposed lacO/R complex in the test plasmid as compared with the intergenic RNAs transcribed from the reference plasmid (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, (+R) panel). Correspondingly, CAT RNA was also significantly reduced in the test plasmid (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, (+R) panel). Note that because primer pair 3 spanned the 66-bp SV40 intron sequence at the 3′-end of the CAT gene, two RT-PCR bands were produced respectively from the un-spliced and the spliced CAT RNAs. Quantification of the RT-PCR bands indicated that CAT mRNA was reduced by ∼70% in the test plasmid (Fig. 2B, bar graph, Table I). Together, these results indicate that the lacO/R complex interposed between the HS2 enhancer and the ϵ-globin promoter in the test plasmid blocked elongation of enhancer"
https://openalex.org/W2079097742,"It is established that neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) is ubiquitylated and proteasomally degraded. The proteasomal degradation of nNOS is enhanced by suicide inactivation of nNOS or by the inhibition of hsp90, which is a chaperone found in a native complex with nNOS. In the current study, we have examined whether CHIP, a chaperone-dependent E3 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase that is known to ubiquitylate other hsp90-chaperoned proteins, could act as an ubiquitin ligase for nNOS. We found with the use of HEK293T or COS-7 cells and transient transfection methods that CHIP overexpression causes a decrease in immunodetectable levels of nNOS. The extent of the loss of nNOS is dependent on the amount of CHIP cDNA used for transfection. Lactacystin (10 μm), a selective proteasome inhibitor, attenuates the loss of nNOS in part by causing the nNOS to be found in a detergent-insoluble form. Immunoprecipitation of the nNOS and subsequent Western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin IgG shows an increase in nNOS-ubiquitin conjugates because of CHIP. Moreover, incubation of nNOS with a purified system containing an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin carrier protein conjugating enzyme (UbcH5a), CHIP, glutathione S-transferase-tagged ubiquitin, and an ATP-generating system leads to the ubiquitylation of nNOS. The addition of purified hsp70 and hsp40 to this in vitro system greatly enhances the amount of nNOS-ubiquitin conjugates, suggesting that CHIP is an E3 ligase for nNOS whose action is facilitated by (and possibly requires) its interaction with nNOS-bound hsp70.

Nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs) 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; nNOS, neuronal NOS; CHIP, carboxyl terminus of hsp70-interacting protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; eNOS, endothelial NOS; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ub, ubiquitin; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; HEK, human embryonic kidney; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein. are cytochrome P450-like hemoprotein enzymes that catalyze the conversion of l-arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide by a process that requires NADPH and molecular oxygen. NOS is bidomain in structure with an oxygenase domain, which contains the cysteine residue that is coordinated to the prosthetic heme as well as the tetrahydrobiopterin binding site, and a reductase domain, which contains the binding sites for FMN, FAD, and NADPH. The NOS is a highly regulated enzyme requiring homodimerization and association with Ca2+-calmodulin for activity. Another mechanism for regulation involves the selective ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of dysfunctional NOS (1Osawa Y. Lowe E.R. Everett A.C. Dunbar A.Y. Billecke S.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This is evident, for example, when metabolism-based or suicide inactivators cause the covalent alteration and inactivation of neuronal NOS (nNOS) and trigger enhanced proteasomal degradation of the enzyme (2Noguchi S. Jianmongkol S. Bender A.T. Kamada Y. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2376-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The nature of the factor(s) that selectively recognize dysfunctional nNOS is unknown; however, inhibition of hsp90 leads to enhanced proteasomal degradation of nNOS, implicating the hsp90-based chaperone machinery as a potential regulator of nNOS protein levels (3Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of cellular proteins are chaperoned by the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery (4Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that these chaperones play a key role in protein triage decisions that maintain quality control of cellular proteins. CHIP is a U-box-containing E3 ubiqutin ligase that binds through its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain to independent TPR acceptor sites on hsp90 and hsp70 (5Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 6Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). CHIP facilitates the ubiquitylation of chaperone substrates, including the glucocorticoid receptor (7Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (8Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), and Raf-1 kinase (9Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Hohfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Because a substantial fraction of all cellular proteins is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, the interaction of CHIP with hsp90 and/or hsp70 is an attractive mechanism for the control of protein triage decisions. The exact mechanism by which CHIP elicits this action is still unclear, although at least three general mechanisms have been investigated: the interaction of CHIP with hsp70 to ubiquitinate chaperoned proteins (5Ballinger C.A.

Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and a combination of the hsp70 and hsp90 mechanisms (6Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In the current study we found that CHIP acts to ubiquitylate nNOS and that hsp70 and hsp40 can facilitate this conjugation reaction. The transient transfection of CHIP into HEK293T cells or COS-7 cells causes the loss of nNOS that is partially attenuated by inhibition of the proteasome with lactacystin. Immunopurification of nNOS from these cells reveals an increased level of nNOS-ubiquitin conjugates because of CHIP. Moreover with the use of an in vitro system containing purified proteins, we show that CHIP in concert with hsp70 and hsp40 effectively ubiquitylates nNOS. This is of special interest in light of a recent discovery that CHIP causes not the ubiquitylation but rather the redistribution of soluble endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) to an insoluble compartment and impairs eNOS trafficking through the Golgi apparatus (11Jiang J. Cyr D. Babbitt R.W. Sessa W.C. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49332-49341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This difference of the two enzymes in trafficking versus degradation may relate to the differences in the structure of the N termini, which include a PDZ domain in nNOS but not eNOS and myristylation and palmitylation sites on eNOS but not nNOS.

Indicated amounts of CHIP cDNA and nNOS cDNA were transfected into 70–80% confluent cells such that the total amount of cDNA was kept constant with vector plasmid. Cells were transfected for 28 h, and where indicated were treated with lactacystin (10 μm) for an additional 20 h. As indicated in experiments where CHIP was immunoprecipitated, myc-CHIP cDNA was used. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitation—Cells from each well of a 6-well plate were harvested 48 h after transfection, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized with a TenBroeck ground glass homogenizer in 0.1 ml of HS buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 15 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide). Where indicated, the transfected cells were treated with 10 μm lactacystin or water vehicle for 20 h before harvesting. In some studies, the transfected cells were treated with 20 μm radicicol or an equivalent amount of Me2SO vehicle for 24 h before harvesting. Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was taken as the “soluble” fraction of cells. The remaining pellet was considered the “insoluble” fraction and was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then sonicated after the addition of 0.1 ml of HS buffer. An aliquot (60 μl) of the resulting soluble or insoluble sample was added to 40 μl of sample buffer containing 5% SDS, 20% glycerol, 6 mg/ml dithiothreitol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. After boiling, 40 μl of the soluble and insoluble protein samples were resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at100 volts. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the use of enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Super Signal, Pierce) and X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). In some experiments, the total cell lysates were prepared by direct sonication in HS buffer and subsequent boiling in sample buffer. In studies where nNOS or ubiquitin was immunopurified, the cells were grown in 10-cm plates and transfected with 6 μg of nNOS cDNA, 6 μg of His-HA-Ub cDNA, and 0.6 μg of CHIP cDNA. The nNOS was immunoprecipitated from the soluble fraction with a rabbit polyclonal antibody as described previously (14Bender A.T. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol.

Expression and Purification of nNOS, CHIP, hsp70, and hsp40 —Rat nNOS was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus and purified by 2′5′-ADP-Sepharose and gel-filtration chromatography as described previously (3Bender A.T.

YDJ-1, the yeast ortholog of hsp40, was expressed in bacteria and purified by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxylapatite as described previously (16Dittmar K.D. Banach M.

In Vitro Ubiquitylation of nNOS—To conjugate Ub to nNOS, purified nNOS (0.24 μg) was incubated with a purified system containing an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (0.1 μm), an E2 GST-tagged UbcH5a (4.0 μm), His-tagged CHIP (4.0 μm), GST-tagged ubiquitin (8.3 μm), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and an ATP-generating system consisting of 4 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, expressed as final concentrations, for 2 h at 30 °C in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. After incubation, 20 μl of sample buffer was added, and an aliquot (10 μl) was loaded for Western blotting. In some studies, nNOS was pretreated with hsp70 and hsp40 and then ubiquitylated as above. In these experiments, 5.0 μm hsp70 and 0.5 μm hsp40 were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C with 1.5 μm nNOS and 2.5 μl of an ATP-generating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) in a total volume of 25 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. The reaction mixture was placed on ice and diluted 5-fold with 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. An aliquot (5 μl) of this reaction mixture was substituted for nNOS in the ubiquitylation reaction mixture containing purified ubiquitin ligases described above and was probed for ubiquitin conjugation. CHIP Enhances the Proteasomal Degradation of nNOS in HEK293T Cells—With the use of transient transfection methods, we tested to see if CHIP, a known ubiquitin E3 ligase for some other hsp90-chaperoned proteins, could act to enhance the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of nNOS. We have previously used the HEK293 cell system to characterize the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of nNOS (14Bender A.T. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17407-17411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this system, both functional inactivation of the nNOS with suicide inactivators and inhibition of hsp90 enhance the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of nNOS (2Noguchi S. Jianmongkol S. Bender A.T. Kamada Y. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2376-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with CHIP and nNOS for 48 h, and cellular lysates were prepared by sonication in detergent-containing buffer. The amount of nNOS, CHIP, and tubulin in these lysates was determined by Western blotting. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, transfection with increasing amounts of CHIP cDNA decreases the amount of immunodetectable nNOS (lanes 1–4). The total amount of cDNA used was made constant by use of the vector plasmid. Treatment of the cells with 10 μm lactacystin, a highly selective inhibitor of the proteasome, for the last 20 h of transfection increased the amount of nNOS observed (lanes 5–8). The bands corresponding to nNOS in all samples were quantified by laser densitometry, and the results are plotted in Fig. 1B. From this analysis, it is clear that the loss of nNOS caused by CHIP is greatly diminished by lactacystin (cf. open circles with closed circles), an indication that CHIP acts to enhance nNOS degradation by the proteasome. In light of a recent finding that CHIP directs eNOS to an insoluble fraction that is not easily extracted by detergent unless sonicated (11Jiang J. Cyr D. Babbitt R.W. Sessa W.C. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49332-49341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we chose to investigate the effect of CHIP on nNOS distribution to a detergent insoluble fraction prepared from cells in a manner similar to that described for eNOS. HEK293T cells were lysed manually by use of a Ten-Broeck glass homogenizer in detergent-containing buffer, and the 16,000 × g supernatant (soluble) and pellet (insoluble) fractions were prepared. The insoluble fraction was sonicated and boiled in sample buffer so that this fraction could be analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, CHIP causes a decrease in the nNOS present in the soluble fraction. Lactacystin had little effect on the soluble nNOS (see samples under Soluble) unlike that observed for the sonicated cell lysates. CHIP appears to slightly increase the amount of nNOS present in the insoluble fraction, whereas a large increase in insoluble nNOS is found after treatment with lactacystin (Insoluble). Lactacystin has been shown to cause the accumulation of proteins that are destined for proteasomal removal in an ordered but aggregated state that is resistant to solubilization by detergent (17Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.S. Sztul E. Traffic. 2002; 3: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 18Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). In addition to HEK293T cells, we investigated the effect of CHIP in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2B). CHIP causes a loss of nNOS in the soluble fraction of COS-7 cells that is partially attenuated by lactacystin. Lactacystin also causes the accumulation of nNOS in the insoluble fraction of COS-7 cells. Thus, the decrease in nNOS protein caused by CHIP is not unique to the HEK293T cells. Effect of Radicicol and CHIP on nNOS—CHIP directly interacts with hsp90 and hsp70, and it is thought that the functional role of CHIP in mediating protein levels are caused by these interactions (5Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 6Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To confirm that nNOS is regulated by chaperones in our cell model, we tested the effect of radicicol, a specific hsp90 inhibitor, and compared it to the effect of CHIP. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of HEK293T cells with radicicol alone causes a decrease in the amount of nNOS in the soluble fraction (cf. lane 1 and lane 4) and greater amounts of nNOS in the insoluble fraction (cf. lane 7 and lane 10). The loss of nNOS in the soluble fraction is consistent with our previous observation after inhibition of hsp90 with geldanamycin (2Noguchi S. Jianmongkol S. Bender A.T. Kamada Y. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2376-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The appearance of nNOS in the insoluble fraction has not been reported previously. To discern the effect of CHIP with radicicol, the bands corresponding to nNOS in the soluble and insoluble fractions were quantified by laser densitometry, and the results are plotted in Fig. 3, B and C, respectively. In the soluble fraction, CHIP causes the loss of nNOS in both radicicol treated (solid circles) and untreated cells (open circles) such that at the highest amount of CHIP similar amounts of nNOS are present. In the insoluble faction, there is an accumulation of nNOS in both radicicol-treated (solid circles) and untreated cells (open circles). Thus, CHIP is able to decrease nNOS in the soluble fraction and increase it in the insoluble fraction even in the presence of radicicol. It remains to be shown whether the hsp90 is not fully inhibited by radicicol and CHIP acts on the remaining hsp90 or CHIP causes a further decrease by a process independent of binding to hsp90. Studies to be described below suggest that the CHIP interaction with hsp70 is important. CHIP Enhances the Ubiquitylation of nNOS in HEK293T Cells—We wanted to obtain direct evidence of the effects of CHIP on the ubiquitylation of nNOS. The nNOS present in HEK293T cells was immunopurified and blotted for nNOS and ubiquitin. The nNOS is specifically precipitated from soluble fraction of HEK293T cells by the immune (IP) IgG antibody but not by the non-immune (NI) IgG (Fig. 4middle panel, cf. lanes 1–4 with lanes 5–8). The nNOS is observed in cells as monoand polyubiquitin conjugates (14Bender A.T. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17407-17411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the levels of these conjugates are increased after treatment with lactacystin (, cf. lane 5 with lane 6). CHIP acts to increase the level of nNOS-Ub conjugates with a more pronounced increase in the presence of lactacystin (lanes 7 and 8). The effect may be underestimated because of the lower amounts of nNOS immunopurified from CHIP-transfected cells as well as the finding that most of the lactacystin-sensitive pool of nNOS ends up in the insoluble fraction, which is not amenable to the immunopurification procedure. Interestingly, CHIP is selectively immunoprecipitated by the anti-nNOS antibody (cf. lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 3 and 4), indicating that CHIP exists in a complex with nNOS. This is expected because nNOS is found in native complexes with large amounts of hsp70 and small amounts of hsp90 (3Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and CHIP binds to hsp70 and hsp90 through TPR acceptor sites. The association of nNOS with CHIP and other chaperones is explored in further detail later. To further validate that nNOS-Ub conjugates have formed, we immunoprecipitated with anti-ubiquitin and blotted for nNOS (Fig. 4B). This is important because the Western blot with anti-ubiquitin above does not differentiate between nNOS-ubiquitin conjugates and ubiquitin conjugates of proteins associated with nNOS. Several higher molecular mass nNOS bands were observed after immunoprecipitation with anti-ubiquitin but not in the non-immune controls. The most intense signals were observed in samples transfected with CHIP and treated with lactacystin, consistent with the formation of nNOS-ubiquitin conjugates. CHIP Enhances the Ubiquitylation of nNOS in an in Vitro System Containing Purified Ub Ligases—The ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP has been observed in an in vitro system containing other known components of a ligase system, including purified E1 and E2 (10Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 11Jiang J. Cyr D. Babbitt R.W. Sessa W.C. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49332-49341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Jiang J. Ballinger C.A. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). To more definitively assess whether CHIP is a ubiquitin ligase for nNOS, we utilized a similar in vitro system containing purified nNOS, E1, E2, and CHIP. We used GST-tagged ubiquitin so that the conjugates could be more easily detected by Western blotting with anti-nNOS IgG. As shown in Fig. 5A in the left panel, nNOS treated with E1, E2, and GST-Ub gives some faint higher molecular mass nNOS immunoreactive bands consistent with conjugation with GST-Ub (lane 2). This may reflect the ability of E2 enzymes to carry out limited ligase reactions with target proteins even in the absence of E3 ligases such as CHIP (19Hermida-Matsumoto M.L. Chock P.B. Curran T. Yang D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4930-4936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The addition of CHIP to this system greatly increases the level of ubiquitin conjugates (lane 3). The addition of purified hsp70 and hsp40 to the CHIP-containing reaction further enhances the level of nNOS-ubiquitin conjugates (lane 4). Probing of the same blot with anti-GST also revealed a banding pattern similar to that for nNOS, although other protein-GST-Ub conjugates are probably present. As shown in Fig. 5B, our purified preparation of nNOS contains substantial amounts of insect hsp70 derived from baculovirus expression in Sf9 cells consistent with our previous observation (3Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This hsp70 co-immunoabsorbs with nNOS, and thus a portion of nNOS is in complex with this chaperone (data not shown). Thus, it may be that hsp70 is required for the binding and action of CHIP and that the lower levels of conjugate formed in the absence of added hsp70 is caused by the low levels of hsp70 in our nNOS preparations. nNOS Exists in Heterocomplexes with CHIP and hsp70 —We wanted to address the biochemical interaction between nNOS and CHIP as well as other chaperones. As shown in Fig. 6A, immunoprecipitation of nNOS (IP) from lactacystin-treated cells is accompanied by co-adsorption of hsp70 and CHIP. These proteins are not observed in the non-immune samples (NI). Consistent with our earlier report (3Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), there is a faint signal for hsp90. As shown in Fig. 6B, anti-myc specifically immunoprecipitates myc-CHIP (cf. IP with NI). The anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lactacystin-treated cells contain nNOS and hsp70 consistent with the finding that CHIP binds to hsp70 through a TPR acceptor site (5Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that hsp90 and hsp70 are associated with nNOS and that inhibition of hsp90 by geldanamycin or suicide inactivation of nNOS both lead to enhanced proteasomal degradation of the enzyme (2Noguchi S. Jianmongkol S. Bender A.T. Kamada Y. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2376-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Bender A.T. Demady D.R. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17407-17411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). One potential mechanism that explains these observations of nNOS degradation is the selective recognition of a dysfunctional form of nNOS by chaperones that in turn recruit ubiquitin ligases. Because CHIP is a U-box-containing E3 ubiqutin ligase that binds through its TPR domain to independent TPR acceptor sites on hsp90 and hsp70 and mediates ubiquitylation of other hsp90-chaperoned proteins (5Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 6Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we wondered if CHIP could act as an ubiquitin ligase for nNOS. In the current study, we have shown that overexpression of CHIP causes the enhanced proteasomal degradation of nNOS. Treatment with lactacystin, a selective inhibitor of the proteasome, attenuates the loss of nNOS caused by CHIP and leads to the accumulation of nNOS-Ub conjugates. Under these conditions, the nNOS in cell cytosols is found associated with CHIP. Moreover, in studies with the use of an in vitro ubiquitylating system containing purified nNOS and ubiquitin ligase enzymes, CHIP increases the amount of nNOS-Ub conjugates. We also show here that hsp70, in the presence of hsp40, greatly facilitates nNOS-ubiquitin conjugation in vitro. Our preparation of nNOS has substantial amounts of insect hsp70, which could not be removed, and thus the absolute requirement for hsp70 could not be tested. Nonetheless, the addition of exogenous hsp70 greatly increases the number of nNOS-ubiquitin conjugates. Thus, it is clear that CHIP acts in concert with hsp70 and hsp40 to enhance the ubiquitylation of nNOS, consistent with the established role of CHIP as a chaperone-dependent E3-ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation is a critical component of protein quality control in cells. How proteins are targeted for ubiquitylation and degradation is fundamental to understanding the control of the cellular protein triage machinery. It is widely thought that the E3 ubiquitin ligases select target proteins for ubiquitylation and thus commit the target protein to proteasomal degradation. CHIP is not only an E3 ligase but is also a co-chaperone for hsp90 and hsp70, and thus CHIP has been proposed to play a role in protein triage decisions through chaperones (6Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). CHIP has been described to act via hsp70, hsp90, or a combination of the two chaperones (6Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 7Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 8Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 10Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of how this occurs is not known. CHIP is known to inhibit the hsp90-dependent binding of steroid to the glucocorticoid receptor and decrease p23 bound to the glucocorticoid receptor·hsp90 heterocomplex (7Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). It was proposed that this remodeling of the hsp90 heterocomplex explains the enhanced ubiquitylation of the glucocorticoid receptor caused by CHIP. Another proposed mechanism is the inhibition of hsp90 in a manner similar to ansamycin drugs, which bind to the ATP binding site of hsp90 (6Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The inhibition of hsp90 by ansamycin drugs and the enhanced proteasomal degradation of the target protein are some of the most convenient and commonly used indicators of an hsp90 client protein. Thus, the inhibition of hsp90 would explain the decreased levels of target protein caused by CHIP. However, in studies with purified proteins, the ubiquitylation of heat-denatured luciferase by CHIP is enhanced when purified hsp90 is added, suggesting a direct role of hsp90 in the ubiquitylation process (10Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). We raise here the possibility that hsp70 directly mediates protein triage decisions by recognition of nNOS and recruiting an ubiquitin ligase machinery that involves CHIP. Bercovich et al. (20Bercovich B. Stancovski I. Mayer A. Blumenfeld N. Laszlo A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) first described the requirement of hsp70 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation of actin, α-crystallin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, α-lactalbumin, and histone H2A. These authors concluded that hsp70 was needed for ubiquitin conjugation to occur but that hsp70 was not an E3-ubiquitin ligase. Consistent with this view, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein is ubiquitylated by CHIP and hsp70 but not hsp90 (8Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Indeed heat-denatured luciferase is ubiquitylated by CHIP in the presence of hsp70 in an in vitro system consisting of purified proteins (10Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, also associates with hsp70 and enhances ubiquitylation (21Tsai Y.C. Fishman P.S. Thakor N.V. Oyler G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22044-22055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). At any time, only a small percentage (<1%) of nNOS is found in the ubiquitylated state, and the ubiquitylated products are thought to represent protein in a non-native conformation. It makes sense that hsp70 makes the triage decision to proceed in the direction of client protein degradation versus stabilization. In the assembly of hsp90 heterocomplexes, the first step is an ATP-dependent interaction with hsp70 and hsp40 to form a “primed” client protein·hsp70 complex that then binds hsp90 in a second ATP-dependent step to form the client protein·hsp90 heterocomplex (4Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). When the client protein is bound by hsp90, it is stabilized, and inhibition of hsp90 binding by geldanamycin or radicicol uniformly results in client protein destabilization, manifest as degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (22Isaacs J.S.

In the early stages of protein damage and unfolding, hydrophobic regions to which hsp70 can bind are exposed. In this case, instead of forming a “primed” complex that can interact with hsp90 and be stabilized, binding of CHIP to the TPR acceptor site on the client protein-bound hsp70 can lead to ubiquitylation and ultimately degradation as shown here with nNOS. Because of the dynamic nature of the interaction of hsp90 and hsp70 with nNOS (3Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol.

However, we intend to pursue this line of investigation with the glucocorticoid receptor, where much more stable heterocomplexes with hsp90 and hsp70 can be formed in stepwise fashion using a purified five-protein assembly system. This can be coupled with the purified ubiquitylation system used here to determine whether hsp70, hsp90, or both can direct CHIP-dependent ubiquitylation of a client protein.

https://openalex.org/W1969022131,"Group A Streptococcus has evolved numerous mechanisms to evade the host immune system to survive, disseminate, and cause disease. Recently a secreted protein named Mac-1 was identified and shown to enhance survival of the pathogen. A new variant of Mac-1 (designated Mac-2) also was recently described and shown to differ from Mac-1 by ∼50% amino acid sequence divergence in the middle one-third of the molecule. To gain new information about the role of Mac-1 and Mac-2 in host-pathogen interactions, solution binding experiments were performed using surface plasmon resonance and purified Mac proteins. Mac-1 bound the same lower hinge region of human IgG as Fc receptors with 2.5 μm affinity, which lead to proteolytic cleavage of the antibody. Similar Km (6.8-18.9 μm) and kcat (0.02-0.13 s-1) values of the Mac-1 endopeptidase activity were obtained for IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. Mac-2 variant, in contrast, bound human IgG poorly (KD = 16 mm) and had weak endopeptidase activity against IgG. Instead, Mac-2 bound FcγRII and FcγRIII with 5 and 75 μm affinity, respectively. This binding competitively blocked IgG from recognition by Fc receptors. Taken together, Mac proteins block immunoglobulin recognition by Fc receptors and degrade immunoglobulins, thereby enhancing survival of the pathogen through the inhibition of phagocytosis, endocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Consequently, these proteins may be potential therapeutic targets. Group A Streptococcus has evolved numerous mechanisms to evade the host immune system to survive, disseminate, and cause disease.

Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). It remains a public health problem in both developed and developing countries. In general, the human immune system has evolved with effective mechanisms to clear bacterial infections (1Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol.

Immunoglobulins are a central part of the adaptive immune system that specifically recognize and mediate the elimination of invading microorganisms. Upon recognition of antigen, immune complexes, through Fc receptor signaling pathway, activate a variety of effector cell functions, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, phagocytosis and endocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles, oxidative burst, and release of inflammatory mediators (1Cunningham M.W.

Many GAS virulence factors are extracellular proteins that can be grouped into three distinct categories (1Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol.

The first category involves proteins that have signal peptides and are actively secreted into the extracellular environment. Examples of these proteins include the exotoxins A and C superantigens. The second category includes extracellular proteins bound to the bacterium cell wall by an (Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly(LPXTG)) anchor sequence. Proteins of a third category lack both an apparent secretion signal sequence and the LPXTG membrane anchor motif (9Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp.

Characterization of the mac gene showed the existence of two divergent Mac variants designated Mac-1 and Mac-2 (12Lei B. DeLeo F.R. Hoe N.P. Graham M.R. Mackie S.M. Cole R.L. Liu M. Hill H.R.

Mac-1 and Mac-2 differ mainly in the amino acid residues located within the middle one-third of the molecule, with ∼50% sequence divergence in this region (14Lei B. DeLeo F.R. Reid S.D. Voyich J.M. Magoun L. Liu M. Braughton K.R. Ricklefs S. Hoe N.P. Cole R.L. Leong J.M. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6880-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mac-1 binds to the surface of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and inhibits opsonophagocytosis and production of reactive oxygen species (12Lei B. DeLeo F.R. Hoe N.P. Graham M.R. Mackie S.M. Cole R.L. Liu M. Hill H.R. Low D.E. Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Musser J.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, Mac-1 was shown to contain immunoglobulin G (IgG)-endopeptidase activity that may contribute to its ability to block PMN opsonophagocytosis (13Pawel-Rammingen U. Johansson B.P. Bjorck L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In this work, we sought to gain new insight into the mechanism of Mac-mediated host immune evasion by characterizing the interaction of the Mac variants with host immunoglobulins and their receptors. Expression, Purification of Recombinant Mac-1 and Mac-2, and Preparation of Fc by Papain Digestion—Recombinant Mac-1 and -2 were expressed and purified to apparent homogeneity as described previously (14Lei B. DeLeo F.R. Reid S.D. Voyich J.M. Magoun L. Liu M. Braughton K.R. Ricklefs S. Hoe N.P. Cole R.L. Leong J.M. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6880-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Fc fragment of human monoclonal IgG1 was isolated by papain digestion. In brief, IgG1 at a concentration of 10 mg/ml was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 6.6% (w/w) papain at pH 7.1 in the presence of 1 mm cysteamine. The Fc fragment was separated from the Fab fragments on a protein A affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) with MAPS II (Bio-Rad) binding and elution buffers at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The Fc fragment was further purified from undigested IgG on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) with 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris at pH 8.0 as a running buffer at a 0.5 ml/min flow rate. SDS-PAGE Endopeptidase Cleavage Assay and N-terminal Sequence Determination—The endopeptidase activity of Mac-1 and Mac-2 was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under reducing condition using Coomassie Blue staining. For N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Protein bands were visualized in Ponceau Red dye, destained with water, and cut out for N-terminal sequencing using a model 477A protein sequencer coupled to a model 120A PTH analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems). Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were performed using BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore AB). Mac-1, Mac-2, and recombinant human Fc receptor (FcγRIII) were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip at concentrations of 3 μm in 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5-6.0, using N-hydrosuccinimide/1-ethyl-3(-3-dimethlaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Flow cell 1 of every sensor chip was mocked with N-hydrosuccinimide/1-ethyl-3(-3-dimethlaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride as a blank control. As a further control for nonspecific binding, soluble Ig-like transcript 4 (ILT4), an immunoglobulin-like receptor expressed on myeloid cells, was immobilized in one of the flow cell in every experiment. All binding and kinetic experiments were performed at room temperature with HBS-EP (BIAcore AB) as running buffer. The immobilization level varied from 500 to 2500 response units. Dissociation constants (KD) were obtained by linear regression of steady state 1/response versus 1/C plots or from kinetic rate constants fitted with the BIAevaluation software package (BIAcore AB). The binding of IgG-Fc fragment, IgG, and IgM to immobilized Mac-1 was measured with serial dilutions of Fc, IgG, and IgM varying from 3 to 0.94 μm, 3.5 to 0.05 μm, and 6.6 to 0.21 μm, respectively. Binding of FcγRII and FcγRIII to immobilized Mac-2 was analyzed with receptor concentrations varying from 25 to 0.39 μm and 47 to 1.49 μm, respectively. Binding of Mac-1 mutant protein (Cys94 → Ala) to Fc was measured with Fc concentration varied in serial dilution from 3 to 0.09 μm. For experiments conducted with reduced Mac-2, the protein was treated overnight with 1 mm DTT and immobilized. Kinetic Experiments on Immobilized FcγRIII and Mac-1—In the case of kinetic experiments on immobilized FcγRIII, 6 μm Fc incubated with 2.6 nm Mac-1 was flown as the analyte every 0.5 h from 1.5 to 4.5 h. 6 μm Fc alone was flown at 0, 1, and 5 h as a control to probe the surface binding capacity of immobilized FcγRIII. Mac-1 at concentration of 2.6 nm was flown at 0.5 h to show that it did not bind FcγRIII. For a similar experiment on human IgG, the analyte consisted of 3 μm IgG incubated with 1 nm Mac-1. In the time course experiments with immobilized Mac-1, 3 μm IgG incubated with 1.3 nm Mac-1 was used as the analyte every 0.5 h from 1.5 to 4.5 h. Mac-1 at a concentration of 1.3 nm was injected at 0.5 h to show that Mac-1 did not bind to itself nonspecifically. IgG at 3 μm concentration was used as the analyte at 0, 1, and 5 h after the injection of Mac-1 to assess the surface binding capacity of the immobilized Mac-1. Enzymatic Rate Constants—To determine the enzyme kinetic parameters of Mac-1 for substrates IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, kinetic binding experiments were performed on CM5 BIAcore sensor chips immobilized with 1) an enzymatic inactive C94A Mac-1 mutant that still retained IgG isotype binding, 2) protein G, and 3) protein A in separate flow cells. The analyte for IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 consisted of 2 μm immunoglobulin mixed with 10 nm Mac-1, while the IgG2 analyte contained 2 μm immunoglobulin and 50 nm Mac-1. The residual binding of immunoglobulins to the immobilized reporter proteins (C94A, protein G, and protein A) upon Mac-1 digestion was assayed kinetically every 5-10 min at room temperature to detect and quantify the residual substrate concentration and thus the concentration of product formed. A 20 mm glycine buffer at pH 9.5 was used for regenerating the C94A Mac-1 flow cell, while 25 mm NaOH was used for regenerating the protein G and protein A flow cells. The kinetic constants (Km, Vmax, and kcat) were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plot. Competition Experiments with Immobilized FcγRIII, Mac-1, and Mac-2—The competition experiment with Mac-1 and Fc receptors was performed on a FcγRIII immobilized chip using analytes consisting of 3 μm Fc mixed with an increasing concentration of Mac-1 from 0 to 2.32 μm. Alternatively, the competition was also measured on an immobilized Mac-1 sensor chip with the analytes containing 2 μm Fc mixed with an increasing concentration of FcγRIII from 0 to 3.8 μm. To evaluate the competition between Mac-2 and IgG for Fc receptor binding, 13 μm FcγRII mixed with an increasing concentration of IgG from 2.8 to 20 μm were flown over immobilized Mac-2. Mac-1 and Mac-2 Bind to Different Components of the Human Immune System—Mac-1 was reported to mimic parts of the CD11b/CD18 complement receptor and to inhibit phagocyte function by binding to FcγRIII, thereby blocking receptor-antibody interaction (12Lei B. DeLeo F.R. Hoe N.P. Graham M.R. Mackie S.M. Cole R.L. Liu M. Hill H.R. Low D.E. Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Musser J.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no detectable binding was observed between FcγRIII and immobilized Mac-1 under direct solution binding conditions using a BIAcore 3000 instrument. Instead, Mac-1 bound to a human IgG with 2.5 μm affinity (Fig. 1b, Table I). In addition to IgG, Mac-1 also recognized IgM with an affinity of ∼34 μm, albeit with a lower affinity (Fig. 1). No detectable binding was observed between Mac-1 and human IgA.Table IDissociation constants for the binding of Mac-1, Mac-1 (C94A), and Mac-2AnalyteConcentration of analyteKDMac-1Mac-1 C94AMac-2μmμmFc3.0–0.0945.45.6NDaND, not detectableIgG1.0–0.0152.52.6NDIgM6.6–0.20634NDIgANDNDFcγRII (CD32)25.0–0.39ND4.4FcγRIII (CD16)47.6–1.49ND70.9a ND, not detectable Open table in a new tab In striking contrast, Mac-2 did not bind human IgG, IgM, and IgA. Rather, Mac-2 bound to the immunoglobulin receptors, FcγRII, and FcγRIII with 5 and 70 μm affinities, respectively (Fig. 1). Overnight treatment of Mac-2 with 1 mm DTT resulted in weak binding of Mac-2 to IgG with an affinity of 16 mm as compared with the micromolar affinity of Mac-1. Reduced Mac-2 retains its micromolar affinity to FcγRII and FcγRIII. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of Mac-1 and Mac-2 to recognize human immunoglobulins and their receptors (Table I), thereby potentially blocking the receptor-antibody interactions and preventing Fcγ receptor mediated phagocytosis and NK cell-mediated ADCC. Mac-1 Recognizes the Lower Hinge Region of IgG and Blocks the Binding of Fcγ Receptors—To test the hypothesis that Mac-1 bound the Fc fragment prepared by papain digestion of a human IgG, solution binding experiments were performed using a serial dilution of Fc varying in concentration from 3 to 0.094 μm. Mac-1 bound Fc with an affinity of ∼5.4 μm, similar to that of IgG (Fig. 1a). To further investigate whether Mac-1 and Fcγ receptors have overlapping binding epitopes on Fc, direct binding competition experiments were performed on a Mac-1 immobilized CM5 sensor chip. The analyte contained 4 μm Fc mixed with increasing concentration of FcγRIII from 0 to 3.8 μm. If Mac-1 recognized the same lower hinge region of Fc as FcγRIII (15Radaev S. Sun P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16478-16483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), Fc binding to the immobilized Mac-1 would decrease as the concentration of FcγRIII increases. Alternatively, if Mac-1 bound to a site distinct from the FcγRIII recognition site, the SPR response will be independent of or will increase with the FcγRIII concentration due to a higher molecular weight of the FcγRIII·Fc complex. The results of the competition experiment showed that Fc binding to Mac-1 decreased with increasing concentrations of FcγRIII (Fig. 2a). This dose-dependent decrease in binding of Fc to Mac-1 indicated that Mac-1 bound to the same lower hinge region of Fc as FcγRIII. Mac Proteins Display IgG Endopeptidase Activity—The endopeptidase activity of both Mac-1 and Mac-2 on human IgG was probed by SDS-PAGE. Consistent with published results (13Pawel-Rammingen U. Johansson B.P. Bjorck L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), Mac-1 cleaved the heavy chain of human IgG but not IgA and IgM. The N terminus of the cleaved fragment (GPSVFLFP) corresponded to amino acid residues 237-244 of the IgG heavy chain. No endopeptidase cleavage was observed when Mac-2 was incubated with various immunoglobulins under the same condition. However, lower level endopeptidase activity of Mac-2 against IgG was observed under reducing conditions in the presence of 1 mm DTT (Fig. 3b). This result is consistent with a previous study showing that Mac-2 is more susceptible to oxidation than Mac-1 as a result of oxidation of its cysteine residues (14Lei B. DeLeo F.R. Reid S.D. Voyich J.M. Magoun L. Liu M. Braughton K.R. Ricklefs S. Hoe N.P. Cole R.L. Leong J.M. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6880-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When the oxidized cysteine side chain of Mac-2 was reduced by overnight incubation with DTT, Mac-2 gained IgG endopeptidase activity, which was significantly less efficient than Mac-1 (Fig. 3b). Reduced Mac-2 did not cleave immunoglobulins IgM and IgA nor FcγRII and FcγRIII. To further define the specificity of the endopeptidase activity of Mac-1, IgG from mouse, sheep, pig, monkey, and rabbit were studied in the cleavage assay. In addition to human IgG, Mac-1 cleaved monkey and rabbit but not mouse, sheep, or pig IgG1 (Fig. 3, a, c, d, and e). Sequence comparison revealed that the human, monkey, and rabbit IgG had a conserved sequence (232PELLGG237) located at the lower hinge region near the site of cleavage (Fig. 3f), suggesting that this PELLGG sequence functions as a binding site for Mac-1. Interestingly, the same LLGG at the lower hinge region of IgG has been implicated as the residues involved in Fcγ receptor binding to antibody in the crystal structure of the Fc·FcγRIII complex (16Radaev S. Motyka S. Fridman W.H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16469-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To test whether Mac-1 cleaved IgG-Fc fragment retain FcγRIII binding ability, a time-dependent binding experiment was performed with an FcγRIII-immobilized CM5 sensor chip. In this experiment, the analyte consisted of IgG-Fc fragment incubated with Mac-1 for various length of time. If Fc cleaved by Mac-1 lost the ability to bind FcγRIII, the BIAcore response will decrease with time as Fc is digested by Mac-1. Alternatively, if the endopeptidase activity of Mac-1 did not affect the ability of Fc fragment to bind FcγRIII, the SPR response will be independent of Mac-1 incubation time. The results showed decreased receptor binding with time, suggesting that the cleaved Fc undergoes a conformational change such that it no longer binds FcγRIII (Fig. 4a). A control binding with IgG alone as the analyte performed at the end of the kinetic experiment showed a SPR response similar to the initial response indicating that the immobilized FcγRIII retained its ligand binding capacity. A consistent result was obtained when an intact human IgG incubated with Mac-1 was used as the analyte (Fig. 4b). Similarly, to verify whether Mac-1 treated Fc can still bind to Mac-1, the latter was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip, and Fc treated with Mac-1 was used as the analyte. The result showed that Mac-1 digested Fc lost its binding to Mac-1 and that the digested product is released by Mac-1 (Fig. 4c). Mac-1 Binding to IgG Is Independent of Its Endopeptidase Activity—To determine whether Mac-1 binding to Fc can be separated from its endopeptidase activity, an enzymatic inactive Mac-1 with Cys94 mutated to Ala was immobilized on the sensor chip and serial dilutions of Fc between 3 and 0.09 μm concentration were used as the analyte. The observed affinity of the mutant Mac-1 to Fc was essentially the same as that of wild type Mac-1 (Fig. 1f) suggesting that the enzymatic activity is separate from its substrate binding. The presence of the endopeptidase activity potentially exacerbates the virulence of Mac-1 compared with other microbial-originated antibody binding proteins, such as protein A and protein G. When Mac-1 was used to inhibit the IgG-Fc binding to immobilized FcγRIII, the results show that, instead of stoichiometric inhibition, a concentration of 2.3 nm Mac-1 was sufficient to completely block the binding of 3 μm Fc to its receptor (Fig. 2b). Thus, the endopeptidase activity of Mac-1 results in 1000-fold increase in its IgG blocking efficiency. The Endopeptidase Activity of Mac-1 Is Inhibited by Cysteine and Aspartic Protease Inhibitors—Mac-1 has been recently reported as a new class of cysteine protease with no sequence homology to other known cysteine proteases (13Pawel-Rammingen U. Johansson B.P. Bjorck L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Using the SDS-PAGE endopeptidase cleavage assay, various protease inhibitors were screened for their ability to block Mac-1 degradation of IgG. Although Mac-1 was characterized as a cysteine protease, not all cysteine protease inhibitors inhibit Mac-1. Among the serine and/or cysteine protease inhibitors, TPCK, TLCK, and iodoacetamide inhibited Mac-1 activity, whereas E64, leupeptin, cystatin, and PMSF did not (Fig. 5). Interestingly, pepstatin, an aspartic protease inhibitor, also inhibited Mac-1 activity indicating a potential involvement of an aspartate either as a catalytic residue or near the catalytic cysteine of Mac-1, which is consistent with the previous mutational studies that identified Asp284 and Asp286 as important residues for enzymatic activity or structure of Mac-1 (17Lei B. Liu M. Meyers E.G. Manning H.M. Nagiec M.J. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2881-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mac-1 Has Comparable Enzyme Kinetic Parameters for IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4—To estimate the Mac-1 binding affinity to all four IgG isotypes, solution binding experiments were performed with varying concentrations of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 (Table II). Mac-1 bound IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 with similar affinity, 2.6, 1.5, and 3 μm, respectively, but recognized IgG2 with lower affinity of 32 μm. The enzyme kinetic parameters of Mac-1 for substrates IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 were determined by a kinetic assay using immobilized C94A Mac-1, protein G, and protein A as reporters for residual intact immunoglobulins. In these experiments, a 2 μm concentration each of the substrate immunoglobulin was incubated with fixed amount of Mac-1, and the SPR response was measured over a period of time (Fig. 6, a, c, and e). The kinetic constants for all the substrates were determined by plotting the reciprocal of the reaction velocity versus reciprocal of the substrate concentration (Lineweaver-Burk plot) (Fig. 6, b, d, and f). In the case of protein A measurements, kinetic constants of Mac-1 were calculated for IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 only as protein A exhibited no detectable binding to IgG3. The rate constants calculated from C94A Mac-1, protein G, and protein A measurements are similar for all the four IgG isotypes. The apparent Km values of Mac-1 varied from 6.8 to 18.9 μm and follow an order of IgG1 > IgG4, IgG2 > IgG3 (Table II). The larger Km of 18.9 μm calculated for the IgG2 substrate from C94A Mac-1 measurement is possibly due to weaker binding between C94A Mac-1 and IgG2 as confirmed by the 10-fold lower KD of Mac-1 to IgG2 when compared with IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4. Vmax of Mac-1 determined from the intercept on the y axis of the Lineweaver-Burk plots varied from 0.09 to 0.19 nmol min-1 with kcat ranging from 0.02 to 0.13 s-1 that follows an order of IgG1, IgG4 > IgG3 > IgG2. The Km and kcat values of Mac-1 lie within the range of other cysteine proteases like papain (8 μm to 320 mm and 0.06-52 s-1), chymopapain (0.1 μm to 5 mm and 0.003-16 s-1), actinidain (20 μm to 89 mm and 0.03-33 s-1), and cathepsin L (0.7 μm to 0.1 mm and 0.002-50 s-1) as reported in the BRENDA, the comprehensive enzyme information system (www.brenda.uni-koeln.de).Table IIEnzyme kinetic parameters of Mac-1 and dissociation constants for IgG subclass bindingImmobilized reporterAnalyte mixed with Mac-1KDKmVmaxkcatμmnmol × min-1s-1Mac C94AIgG12.6 μm6.80.130.12IgG232 μm18.90.090.02IgG31.5 μm13.90.090.08IgG43 μm11.90.120.1Protein GIgG12 nm7.80.130.12IgG23.1 nm10.10.190.03IgG36.1 nm130.110.09IgG44.7 nm10.90.130.12Protein AIgG11.3 nm9.10.160.13IgG22.1 nm11.20.160.03IgG3NDaND, not detectableNDNDNDIgG43.4 nm11.40.140.12a ND, not detectable Open table in a new tab Mac-2 Recognition of FcγR Prevents the Binding of IgG to Its Receptor—Unlike Mac-1, Mac-2 recognizes Fc receptors on the effector cells. To determine whether binding of Mac-2 to FcR precluded antibodies from binding to the receptors, a mixture of 13 μm FcγRII with various concentration of IgG was used in a solution competition binding experiment on a Mac-2 immobilized sensor chip. The result showed that FcγRII binding to Mac-2 decreased as the concentration of IgG increased, suggesting that Mac-2 and IgG share a closely related binding site on FcγRII (Fig. 7). This result implied that Mac-2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of GAS infection by blocking immune complex-mediated activation of effector function. GAS is an important human bacterial pathogen that causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathogen has evolved several complex mechanisms to evade host defenses, proliferate, and cause diseases in human. A recent study (14Lei B. DeLeo F.R. Reid S.D. Voyich J.M. Magoun L. Liu M. Braughton K.R. Ricklefs S. Hoe N.P. Cole R.L. Leong J.M. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6880-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) has identified two major allele families of mac genes designated as mac-1 and mac-2 with considerable divergence in the middle one-third of the protein. Our studies confirmed that Mac-1 is a cysteine/aspartic protease that recognizes and cleaves the lower hinge region of human IgG. Mac-2, which cleaves IgG at a much slower rate, is capable of binding to immunoglobulin receptors, FcγRII and FcγRIII. The Fc region of IgG molecule has multiple recognition sites for different components of the immune system, including Fcγ receptors, neonatal Fc receptors, rheumatoid factors, and bacterial proteins like staphylococcal proteins A and G (16Radaev S.

The Fcγ receptor binding site on Fc is distinct from those of other binding proteins as it binds to the lower hinge region between the CH1 and CH2 domains of Fc, while other ligands bind to the joint region between the CH2 and CH3 domain. It has been shown that Fcγ receptors recognize Fc in an asymmetric fashion with one receptor bound to both the chains of Fc (16Radaev S. Motyka S. Fridman W.H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16469-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 21Garman S.C. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S.

SPR measurement showed that Mac-1 recognizes competitively the same region of IgG as Fcγ receptors. Recently, Mac-1 was reported to have endopeptidase activity on human IgG (13Pawel-Rammingen U. Johansson B.P. Bjorck L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The results indicated that in addition to human IgG, Mac-1 also cleaved monkey and rabbit IgG, which suggests that any IgG with a conserved lower hinge sequence of PELLGG at positions 232-237 can be cleaved. Interestingly, these lower hinge residues are also involved in the Fcγ receptor recognition of Fc. The search for the inhibitors of Mac-1 revealed that not all cysteine protease inhibitors inhibit its endopeptidase activity. Cysteine protease inhibitors like E64, leupeptin, cystatin, and PMSF did not inhibit Mac-1. To our surprise, pepstatin, an aspartic and human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor, also inhibited Mac-1. This could be interpreted as the presence of an aspartate residue either directly involved in the catalysis or close to the active site, consistent with data from site-specific mutagenesis studies (17Lei B. Liu M. Meyers E.G. Manning H.M. Nagiec M.J. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2881-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mac-1 binds and cleaves all the four subclasses of IgG isotypes. The Km and kcat values calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots show that the order of Mac-1 cleavage follows IgG1 > IgG4, IgG2 > IgG3, and IgG1, and IgG4 > IgG3 > IgG2, respectively. The Km and kcat values of Mac-1 for IgG isotypes fall within the range of other known cysteine proteases like papain, chymopapain, actinidian, and cathepsin. To address whether the cysteine protease activity of Mac proteins is important for their biological function, we showed using a catalytic inactive mutant Mac-1 that the binding of Mac-1 to IgG is independent of its enzymatic activity. The presence of endopeptidase activity of Mac-1, however, increases its ability to remove immunoglobulins by 1000-fold in vitro and thus could greatly enhance the ability of GAS to interfere with phagocytosis, endocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles, and NK cell-mediated ADCC (Fig. 8). Reduced Mac-2 had weaker IgG endopeptidase activity than Mac-1. However, it retains the capacity to bind Fcγ receptors. The Fc receptor binding of Mac-2 competes with that of IgG and thus should inhibit the Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis and ADCC (Fig. 8). Our results bear on the two models that have been proposed to explain the functional mechanism of Mac. Lei et al. (12Lei B. DeLeo F.R. Hoe N.P. Graham M.R. Mackie S.M. Cole R.L. Liu M. Hill H.R. Low D.E. Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Musser J.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) proposed that binding of Mac-1 to Fcγ receptors blocked their interaction (blocking mechanism). It was subsequently reported (13Pawel-Rammingen U. Johansson B.P. Bjorck L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) that Mac-1 has IgG endopeptidase activity, resulting in the proposal that the enzymatic activity of Mac was essential for its function (endopeptidase-essential mechanism). Our data suggest that Mac-2 functions mainly through the blocking mechanism. In contrast, Mac-1 did not bind to recombinant Fcγ receptors, and treatment of IgG and Fc fragment with Mac-1 diminished their binding to Fcγ receptors, consistent with the endopeptidase-essential mechanism. However, a Cys94 → Ala mutant Mac-1 protein that is unable to cleave IgG retains the ability to inhibit IgG-mediated phagocytosis by human PMNs (14Lei B. DeLeo F.R. Reid S.D. Voyich J.M. Magoun L. Liu M. Braughton K.R. Ricklefs S. Hoe N.P. Cole R.L. Leong J.M. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6880-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); this can be explained by our solution binding results that the mutant retained its ability bind to IgG with similar affinity as wildtype. Although no direct interaction between Mac-1 and Fcγ receptors was detected in our solution binding assays, it is possible that Mac-1 binds to native Fcγ receptors present on PMNs. The observations that Mac-1 binds to the surface of human PMNs and that the binding is blocked by mouse monoclonal antibody specific to FcγRIII is consistent with this idea (12Lei B. DeLeo F.R. Hoe N.P. Graham M.R. Mackie S.M. Cole R.L. Liu M. Hill H.R. Low D.E. Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Musser J.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Clearly, further studies are required to determine the extent to which Mac-1 uses the blocking mechanism in the complex environment of GAS-human interactions in vivo. In summary, our data suggest that secreted Mac proteins made by GAS mediate host immune evasion by two different molecular mechanisms, each detrimentally altering antibody-mediated activities of the human immune system. These proteins would result in either degradation of immunoglobulins or blockade of their receptors, thus inhibiting normal host immune function and enhancing pathogen survival. We thank Dr. S. Radaev for providing FcγRIII and comments on the manuscript, C. Hammer for acquiring mass spectrometry data, and M. Garfield for N-terminal amino acid sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2014572978,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as an energy-sensing protein kinase that is activated by a variety of metabolic stresses that lower cellular energy levels. When activated, AMPK modulates a network of metabolic pathways that result in net increased substrate oxidation, generation of reduced nucleotide cofactors, and production of ATP. AMPK is activated by a high AMP:ATP ratio and phosphorylation on threonine 172 by an upstream kinase. Recent studies suggest that mechanisms that do not involve changes in adenine nucleotide levels can activate AMPK. Another sensor of the metabolic state of the cell is the NAD/NADH redox potential. To test whether the redox state might have an effect on AMPK activity, we examined the effect of β-NAD and NADH on this enzyme. The recombinant T172D-AMPK, which was mutated to mimic the phosphorylated state, was activated by β-NAD in a dose-dependent manner, whereas NADH inhibited its activity. We explored the effect of NADH on AMPK by systematically varying the concentrations of ATP, NADH, peptide substrate, and AMP. Based on our findings and established activation of AMPK by AMP, we proposed a model for the regulation by NADH. Key features of this model are as follows. (a) NADH has an apparent competitive behavior with respect to ATP and uncompetitive behavior with respect to AMP resulting in improved binding constant in the presence of AMP, and (b) the binding of the peptide is not significantly altered by NADH. In the absence of AMP, the binding constant of NADH becomes higher than physiologically relevant. We conclude that AMPK senses both components of cellular energy status, redox potential, and phosphorylation potential.

AMPK is also activated by a number of pharmacological interventions. AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-b-d-ribonucleoside), which is converted to an AMP analog upon entering the cells, is a commonly used tool for activating AMPK (5Henin N. Vincent M-F.

The activation of AMPK stimulates fatty acid oxidation, hexokinase activity, and uptake of glucose into skeletal muscle, which generates reduced nucleoside co-factors and ATP, and represses hepatic gluconeogenic and fatty acid synthesis enzymes, which consume them (10Kemp B.E.

This kinase has been recently identified as LKB1 (15Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G.D. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D. Curr.

Although the activation of AMPK appears to be a direct consequence of an increase in the AMP:ATP ratio as a result of metabolic stresses that deplete cellular ATP, Lopaschuk and colleagues (17Makinde A.O. Kantor P.F. Lopaschuk G.D. Mol. Cell.

Other studies in various tissues also suggest that AMPK can be activated by mechanisms that do not involve changes in adenine nucleotide levels (6Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G.

Studies have shown that a high intracellular NADH/NAD ratio inhibits major metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation (21Williamson J.R. Chang K. Frangos M. Hasan K.S. Idom Y.

In the present paper, we provide evidence that NAD activates and NADH inhibits the activity of the recombinant AMPK heterotrimeric enzyme. This kind of metabolic regulation might provide an important physiological benefit and an alternative explanation to the activation of AMPK in the absence of changes in adenine nucleotide levels. Reagents—[γ-33P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All of the other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid Construction—Co-expression of all three AMPK subunits is required for AMPK enzymatic activity. The α2, β1, and γ1 subunits were amplified from human muscle cDNA by PCR using primers containing a consensus Kozak sequence for proper translation of the gene of interest. The cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pPR1, which contains the replication origin (oriP), and a cytomegalovirus promoter. To mimic a phosphorylation state, the catalytic subunit was mutated at threonine 172, the residue that is normally phosphorylated in response to AMP, to an aspartic acid (T172D). α2 T172D was generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To facilitate downstream detection and purification, a C-terminal FLAG epitope and His tag were incorporated into the β subunit. Expression of Wild Type (WT) and T172D AMPK in 293E Cells—The WT α2 or T172D α2, β1, and γ1 were transiently co-transfected into HEK-293E cells at a 1:1:1 molar ratio using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were harvested after 48–65 h. The cell lysate was prepared by resuspending cell pellets in M-Per mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing 1× EDTA-free complete (Roche Diagnostics), 50 mm NaF, and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate and spinning at 6000 rpm to remove cell debris. Antibodies to FLAG or gene-specific antibodies were used to detect the expressed protein by Western blot analysis. Purification of T172D and WT AMPK—The kinase was purified to near homogeneity from cell lysates by a single Ni-NTA chromatography, and the three subunits were confirmed with MALDI-MS. NaCl was added to the cell lysate to a final concentration of 150 mm and then incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 4 °C overnight. The resin was collected and packed to a Sephadex G25 XK 50/14 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Brij-35, 10% glycerol) containing 10 mm imidazole. Functional AMPK was eluted from the column with Buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole and concentrated by Centriprep-10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The product was desalted using a Sephadex G25 XK 50/14 column and stored frozen in buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA at –70 °C. The purified recombinant enzyme was active and exhibited AMP-dependent stimulation that was 5–10-fold higher than that of the wild type enzyme. AMPK Assay—AMPK activity was measured in a 96-well filter-binding kinase assay by following the incorporation of 33P into the synthetic SAMS peptide, an AMPK-specific peptide substrate (modified from Hardie et al.) (22Hardie D.G. Haystead T.A.J. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Assay and Purification of Protein-Serine/Threonine Kinases in Protein Phosphorylation: a Practical Approach Series. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 201-219Google Scholar). The reaction volume was 40 μl and was composed of the following components: 40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Brij-35, and 100 μm AMP; 100 μm SAMS, 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2,75 mm NaCl, 10 μl of diluted T172D AMPK or WT AMPK per reaction; and 3.3 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP. The reaction was performed at room temperature for 2 h and terminated by the addition of 8 μl of ice-cold 6% phosphoric acid. 40 μl of reaction was transferred onto a 96-well phosphocellulose filter plate (Millipore) followed by washes with 0.75% phosphoric acid and a final rinse with 100 μl of acetone. The filter was air-dried, and 50 μl of Wallac scintillation fluid (OptiPhase”SuperMix,“PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per well was used for counting in a Wallac Microbeta plate counter. Kinetic Model—The model for the rate of peptide phosphorylation, P[t], by AMPK was derived as described by Segel (23Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 330-337Google Scholar) assuming that a rapid equilibrium assumption gives rise to Equations 1, 2, 3, P′[t]=(kcatβKC+kcatCαCn)EtABKN(D1+D2) (Eq. 1) D1=KBα(AKN(Cn+KCβ)γ+KAβ(Cn(KN+N)γ+KC(N+KNγ)))δ (Eq. 2) D2=B(KCβ(AKNγ+KAα(N+KNγ)δ+Cnαγ(AKNδ+KAβ(N+KNδ)))(Eq. 3) where KA, KB, KC, and KN are dissociation constants, n is the Hill coefficient, and α, β, γ, and δ are cooperativity constants (Fig. 5). By dividing P′[t] where NADH (N) concentration equals the IC50 by itself at N equals zero and setting the ratio to 0.5, one can predict the IC50 for NADH at any given ATP (A), peptide (B), and AMP (C) concentration using Equation 4. IC50=KN(KA(B+KB)(Cn+Kc)αβ+A(KBα(Cn+KCβ)+B(Cnα+KC)))γKA(B+KB)αβ(KC+Cnγ) (Eq. 4) The mammalian AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic (α) subunit and two regulatory (β and γ) subunits. To mimic a phosphorylation state, we mutated the catalytic subunit at threonine 172, the residue that is normally phosphorylated in response to AMP, to an aspartic acid (T172D). The WT α2 or T172D-α2, β1, and γ1 cDNAs were transiently co-transfected into HEK-293E cells, and cells were harvested after 48–65 h. The kinase was purified to near homogeneity from cell lysates by single Ni-NTA chromatography. The identities of the three subunits have been confirmed by MALDI-MS. Enzyme activity was assessed by incorporation of [33P]phosphate into the SAMS peptide. The purified recombinant enzymes were active and exhibited AMP-dependent stimulation. The Km for ATP was 76 μm, and for the SAMS peptide, it was 100 μm. AMP activated the T172D-AMPK enzyme with an EC50 of 2.82 μm, whereas EC50 for the wild type enzyme was 0.675 μm. The activity of T172D enzyme was 5–10-fold higher than that of the wild type enzyme (data not shown). To test whether the redox state might have an effect on AMPK activity, we examined the effect of β-NAD and NADH on this enzyme. Both the recombinant T172D-AMPK and the WT-AMPK enzymes were activated by β-NAD in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas NADH inhibited its activity (Fig. 1, C and D). Because the signal for AMPK activity obtained in the kinase assay was more robust using the T172D-AMPK enzyme compared with the WT-AMPK, we used the former enzyme for all of the additional experiments. This activity was not due to contaminants in the purified recombinant AMPK, because this experiment when performed with purified fraction from a mock transfection did not show any phosphoryltransferase activity. The potency of NADH to inhibit AMPK activity improved in the presence of increasing concentrations of AMP as can be seen by the decreasing IC50 values (Fig. 2A). In contrast, we observed a lesser effect of AMP on the ability of NAD to activate AMPK and, at 3 μm AMP, an actual decrease in activity was apparent (Fig. 2B). We further explored the effect of NADH on AMPK by systematically varying ATP, peptide, AMP, and NADH concentrations. Because NADH is a nucleotide, it seemed reasonable that NADH would bind in either the ATP or AMP binding pocket and be competitive with respect to one or the other. Fig. 3 shows representative data demonstrating apparent ATP competitive behavior with respect to NADH. What was surprising was the uncompetitive behavior with respect to AMP as shown in Fig. 4. We explored multiple known kinetic models to simulate the data. Finally, based upon the established activation of AMPK by AMP (24Davies S.P. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), we proposed the mechanism for AMPK regulation by AMP and NADH shown in Fig. 5. This model contains a Hill coefficient to account for the cooperativity as reported by Hardie et al. (25Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Hawley S.A. Davies S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The key points of this model are as follows. (a) NADH has an apparent competitive behavior with respect to ATP and apparent uncompetitive inhibition with respect to AMP, resulting in enhanced binding of NADH to the enzyme in the presence of AMP and peptide. (b) The binding of the peptide to the enzyme-NADH complex is not significantly altered. (c) In the absence of AMP, the binding constant of NADH becomes higher than physiologically relevant.Fig. 2The effect of NADH (A) and NAD (B) in the presence of AMP. 0.1–3.0 μm AMP added to the reaction led to a significant improvement in the ability of NAD and NADH to stimulate or inhibit phosphoryl transfer by AMPK, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Plot of effect of ATP on the inhibition of AMPK by NADH.

Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). After its activation, AMPK phosphorylates enzymes leading to increased fatty-acid oxidation during which NADH and ATP are produced. ATP has been shown to antagonize the stimulating effect of AMP. Several papers point out the fact that other factors in addition to AMP and ATP might activate or inhibit AMPK activity (9Hawley S.A. Gadalla A.E. Olsen G.S. Hardie D.G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2420-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 19Frederich M. Balschi J.A. J. Biol.

Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4365) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, our study shows for the first time clear evidence that NADH inhibits AMPK activity. This study also shows that β-NAD can activate AMPK, although at a lesser extent than AMP, and that, at higher concentrations, it might even inhibit the activity. The full kinetic evaluation of NAD binding is still under investigation. Previous studies by Hardie et al. (24Davies S.P. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) have shown that AMP can activate AMPK by several mechanisms including allosteric activation of AMPK, allosteric activation of an upstream kinase, and the binding of AMP to AMPK, thus making it a better substrate for the upstream kinase and rendering it a poorer substrate for protein phosphatases. Our results demonstrate that NAD and NADH regulate AMPK, both the wild type and the phosphorylated form (T172D) directly, but we do not have evidence to show that they have any regulatory effect on an upstream kinase or protein phosphatases. It is tempting to speculate that, during myocardial ischemia when AMPK is activated, NADH, which is produced by the process of fatty-acid oxidation, serves as a negative regulator of AMPK activity to improve the post-ischemic functional recovery of the heart. Stimulation of substrate oxidation and NADH formation under conditions when NADH is already high and cannot be utilized to form ATP might be harmful. The ability of NADH to inhibit AMPK might prevent this detrimental effect. Other studies have shown that the intracellular lactate concentration and the lactate/pyruvate ratio increase substantially in contracting muscle (26Barron J.T. Gu L. Parrillo J.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 194: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An effect of augmented lactate production to increase the cytoplasmic NADH/NAD ratio and to alter the cytoplasmic redox potential may have an important regulatory effect on AMPK activity and oxidative metabolism. AMPK inhibition by NADH becomes an even more interesting phenomenon in view of latest studies showing that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion requires inhibition of AMPK (27da Silva Xavier G. Leclerc I. Varadi A. Tsuboi T. Moule S.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Matschinsky et al. (28Trus M.D. Hintz C.S. Weinstein J.B. Williams A.D. Pagliara A.S. Matschinsky F.M. Life Sci. 1978; 22: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) have shown that stimulation of pancreatic islets with high glucose prompted elevation of NADH in the islets. Once again, we could speculate that this would potentially lead to inhibition of AMPK, which will then enable insulin secretion. Finally, as insulin was shown to increase NADH/NAD redox state (29Kahn A.M. Allen J.C. Zhang S. Am. J. Hypertens. 2002; 15: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the question arises of whether this could be the reason for the observed inhibition of AMPK activity by insulin in isolated rat hearts (30Gamble J.

Such “core” aldehydes elicit immune responses and promote inflammation. However, the biochemical mechanisms by which phospholipid aldehydes are metabolized or detoxified are not well understood. In the studies reported here, we examined whether aldose reductase (AR), which reduces hydrophobic aldehydes, metabolizes phospholipid aldehydes. Incubation with AR led to the reduction of 5-oxovaleroyl, 7-oxo-5-heptenoyl, 5-hydroxy-6-oxo-caproyl, and 5-hydroxy-8-oxo-6-octenoyl phospholipids generated upon oxidation of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC). The enzyme also catalyzed the reduction of phospholipid aldehydes generated from the oxidation of 1-alkyl, and 1-alkenyl analogs of PAPC, and 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl phosphatidic acid or phosphoglycerol. Aldose reductase catalyzed the reduction of chemically synthesized 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POVPC) with a Km of 10 μm. Addition of POVPC to the culture medium led to incorporation and reduction of the aldehyde in COS-7 and THP-1 cells. Reduction of POVPC in these cells was prevented by the AR inhibitors sorbinil and tolrestat and was increased in COS-7 cells overexpressing AR. Together, these observations suggest that AR may be a significant participant in the metabolism of several structurally diverse phospholipid aldehydes.

Lipid peroxidation is a multistep process that involves the abstraction of electrons from unsaturated fatty acids by metals or free radicals and results in the formation of alkoxyl and peroxyl radicals. These radicals in turn oxidize additional substrates, thereby perpetuating an autocatalytic cycle, which is ultimately terminated by radical-radical interactions. The overall process leads to the formation of many non-radical intermediates and end products including peroxides, aldehydes, epoxides, and isoprostanes (18Esterbauer H. Cheeseman K.H. Dianzani M.U.

Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether these phospholipids undergo intracellular oxidation-reduction reactions. We have previously reported that short to medium (C3-C12) chain aldehydes and their glutathione conjugates are efficiently reduced by the polyol pathway enzyme aldose reductase (AR; Refs. 43Srivastava S.

These studies indicated that AR has wide substrate specificity and an unusually accommodating active site that efficiently recognizes large hydrophobic and hydrophilic aldehydes (44Srivastava S.

Based on these observations, we formulated the hypothesis that AR may be an efficient catalyst for reducing phospholipid aldehydes. Accordingly, we tested the efficacy of the enzyme with aldehyde phospholipids generated from the oxidation of acyl, alkyl, and alkenyl-linked phospholipids and phospholipid-containing different head groups. Our results show that AR efficiently reduces multiple classes of aldehyde phospholipids and participates in the intracellular transformation of phospholipid aldehydes. These results reveal a novel pathway for the metabolism of oxidized phospholipids, which may be a significant regulator of atherogenesis, oxidative injury, inflammation, and apoptosis. Materials—PAPC, its alkyl, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-PC (alkyl-PAPC), and plasmenyl, 1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-2-arachidonoyl-PC (p-PAPC) analogs, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphoglycerol (PAPG), and 1-palmitoyl-2-archidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid (PAPA) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Sephadex G-25 columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Sorbinil and tolrestat were gifts from Pfizer Chemical Company and American Home Products, respectively. Solvents and other analytical grade reagents were obtained from Sigma. The COS-7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and human monocytoid cells (THP-1) were obtained from Clonetics. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies. Molecular Modeling—The structure of AR was generated from the homologous structure FR-1 (PDB entry: 1FRB.ent; Ref. 49Wilson D.K. Nakano T. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14323-14330Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using MOD-ELER (50Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10629) Google Scholar). The homology model is consistent with the AR structure deposited in the (PDB entry 1MAR; Ref. 51Wilson D.K. Tarle I. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9847-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), which only contains the carbon atoms for AR, and was used for the docked conformational search of POVPC. The NADP+ was placed in the same orientation as in FR-1. In this structure the coenzyme binds to the protein in an unusually extended conformation and relative to ribose, both nicotinamide and adenine adopt the anti conformation. For modeling, NADP+ was converted to NADPH, and minimized in situ while restraining AR. Although the nicotinamide ring of NADPH is puckered (52Meijers R. Morris R.J. Adoplh H.W. Merli A. Lamzin V.S. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9316-9321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), to examine steric interaction a simpler planar conformation of NADPH was used. In AKRs the binding site residues are stronger determinants of substrate orientation than the oxidation state of the cofactor and simulations of substrate binding with planar or bent NADPH show similar conformers (53Steckelbroeck S.

The lowest energy starting structure of POVPC was generated and refined using molecular mechanics and dynamics (Macromodel 7.0 Ref. 54Mohamadi F. Richards N.G. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M.

The docking of POVPC with AR was performed using a manual dock, placing POVPC in the active site, followed by simulated annealing (sampling 100 structures over 300 ps using molecular dynamics, 1.5-fs time step, 750 °C, AMBER* force field, GBSA implicit water solvation, followed by minimization of each structure using steepest descents (1000 steps) conjugate gradient (1000 steps)) of the system with POVPC unrestrained and keeping AR and NADPH coordinates fixed. Distance restraints were added to be consistent with the mechanism previously proposed (55Lee Y.S. Hodoscek M. Brooks B.R. Kador P.F. Biophys. Chem. 1998; 70: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The distance of the aldehyde oxygen to His110 and, Tyr48 and carbon of aldehyde to NADPH was 2.00, 2.53, and 2.59 Å, respectively. Synthesis of POVPC—POVPC was synthesized as outlined in Scheme 1. Briefly, 5-pentanolide (compound 1, 0.1 mol) in dry methanol (200 ml) was mixed with 2 μmol of concentrated sulfuric acid, and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 5 h and then cooled on an ice/salt bath, after which 1 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 10 min, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The methyl-5-hydroxypentanoate (compound 2) generated from the reaction (with a 99% yield) was oxidized with pyridinium chlorochromate to methyl-5-oxopentanoate (compound 3, yield; 70%). The 1H NMR spectra of methyl-5-hydroxypentanoate and methyl-5-oxopentanoate were similar to those reported earlier (56Nakamura Y. Ito A. Shin C. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1994; 67: 2151-2161Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The methyl 5-oxopentanoate (18 mmol) was mixed with para-toluene sulfonic acid (p-TSOH·H2O) (0.53 mmol) and trimethylorthoformate (90 mmol) in dry methanol (30 ml), and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature, neutralized with 2% KOH, and concentrated. The residue was dissolved in diethyl ether (50 ml), washed with brine solution (15 ml), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Methyl 5,5-dimethoxypentanoate (compound 4, yield; 75%) was obtained after purifying the residue on a silica gel column using hexane/ethyl acetate (3:7,v/v). The methyl ester identified by 1H NMR (54Mohamadi F. Richards N.G. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M. Caufield C. Chang G. Hendricksen T. Still W.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 440-455Crossref Scopus (3933) Google Scholar) and 142 mg of the ester was stirred with a solution of NaOH (4 mmol, 5 equivalent) in 4 ml of tetrahydrofuran/water/methanol (3:2:5, v/v/v) at room temperature. After 2 h, the reaction mixture was acidified with cold 0.1 n HCl and extracted with diethyl ether (4 × 20 ml). The combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvent was removed under vacuum to obtain 5-dimethoxypentanoic acid (compound 5, 120 mg; 93%), which was identified by its 1H NMR characteristics. The 5-dimethoxypentanoic acid (compound 5, 0.53 mmol; 3.1 eq) and 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (0.17mmol; 1 equivalent) were dried by azeotropic distillation with benzene (5 × 4 ml) under reduced pressure, at room temperature, and then at 300 °C. The flask was flushed with argon, and freshly distilled CHCl3 (10 ml), dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (0.51 mmol; 3 eq), and p-(N,N-dimethylamino) pyridine (0.51 mmol; 3 equivalent) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 48 h, and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue was flash-chromatographed on a column (20 mm × 180 mm) of silica gel (40 μm Alltech) with chloroform/methanol (9:1) and chloroform/methanol/water (70:26:4 v/v/v) to obtain 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-diemthoxypentanoyl)-PC (compound 7, 185 mg; 86%). The 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-dimethoxypentanoyl)-PC was dissolved in 12 ml of acetone/water (6:1 v/v), and Amberlyst-15 resin (35 mg) was added to the mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred for 6 h and filtered, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel 40 μm Alltech, chloroform/methanol/water 70:26:4 v/v/v) to generate POVPC (compound 8, 25 mg, 77%). The 1H NMR characteristics of the purified compound in CDCl3 at 500 MHz were: d 9.69 (s, 1H), 5.15 (m, 1H), 4.38–3.76 (m, 8H), 3.29 (s, 9H), 2.61 (t, 2H), 2.41(m, 2H), 2.27(t, 2H), 1.95 (t, 2H), 1.59 (m, 2H), 1.21 (m, 24H), 0.85 (t, 3H), and are in agreement with those reported by Stremler et al. (33Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntryre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of AR Activity—Recombinant human AR was prepared as described (57Srivastava S. Liu S-Q. Conklin D.J. Zacarias A. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; (563-571): 130-132Google Scholar). Before each experiment, the stored enzyme was reduced by incubating with 0.1 m dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 1 h in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Excess dithiothreitol was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10), pre-equilibrated with nitrogen-saturated 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm EDTA. To prevent enzyme oxidation, all operations were performed at 4 °C. The reduced enzyme, separated from dithiothreitol, was stored under nitrogen and used within 1–3 h. To ensure that the enzyme was fully reduced, the sensitivity of the enzyme to sorbinil was measured. The activity of the fully reduced enzyme is inhibited by 80% in the presence of 10 μm sorbinil (59Bhatnagar A. Liu S-Q. Das B. Srivastava S.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 825-830PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of the enzyme was measured at 30 °C in a 1-ml reaction system containing 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, with 0.15 mm NADPH and varying concentrations of POVPC. The purity of POVPC was established by ESI+/MS and its concentration was determined by measuring inorganic phosphate as described before (60Zacarias A. Bolanowski D. Bhatnagar A. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and by measuring its choline content using the phospholipid kit obtained from Wako Chemicals. The reaction was monitored by measuring the disappearance of NADPH at 340 nm using a Varian spectrophotometer (Cary Bio 50). One unit of AR is defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1 μmol of NADPH per min. The control cuvette contained all components of the mixture except the substrate. Initial velocity was measured at eight different concentrations of the substrate, and steady-state kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the general Michaelis-Menten equation to the data using a nonlinear iterative fitting procedure (44Srivastava S. Watowich S.J. Petrash J.M. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2021760273,"Heme oxygenase-1 is an antioxidant defense enzyme that converts heme to biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide. Bach-1 is a bZip protein that forms heterodimers with small Maf proteins and was reported recently to down-regulate the HO-1 gene in mice. Using small interfering RNAs targeted to human Bach-1 mRNA, we investigated whether modulation of human hepatic Bach-1 expression by small interfering (si)RNA technology influences heme oxygenase-1 gene expression. We found that Bach-1 siRNAs transfected into Huh-7 cells significantly reduced Bach-1 mRNA and protein levels ∼80%, compared with non siRNA-treated cells. In contrast, transfection with the same amounts of nonspecific control duplexes or LaminB2-duplex did not reduce Bach-1 mRNA or protein levels, confirming the specificity of Bach-1 siRNA. Expression of the heme oxygenase-1 gene in Bach-1 siRNA-transfected cells was up-regulated 7-fold, compared with cells without Bach-1 siRNA. The effect of increasing concentrations of heme to up-regulate levels of heme oxygenase-1 was more pronounced when Bach-1 siRNA was present. Taken together, these results indicated that Bach-1 has a specific and selective ability to repress expression of human hepatic heme oxygenase-1. Silencing of Bach-1 by siRNAs is a useful method for up-regulating HO-1 gene expression. Exogenous heme produces additional up-regulation, beyond that produced by Bach-1 siRNAs, suggesting that heme does not act solely through its effects on Bach-1.

Three isoforms of HO, termed HO-1, -2, and -3, have been described (7Shibahara S. Yoshizawa M. Suzuki H. Takeda K. Meguro K. Endo K. J. Biochem.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Among the three isoforms of HO, only HO-1 is highly inducible. Earlier work from our and other laboratories established that HO-1 could be up-regulated markedly by a variety of stressful stimuli, as well as by heme or certain other metalloporphyrins, particularly, cobalt protoporphyrin (10Lincoln B.C.

The primary mechanism for up-regulation of the HO-1 gene is by increased transcription of the gene (15Srivastava K.K. Cable E.E. Donohue S.E. Bonkovsky H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the induction by such stressors as sodium arsenite or other arsenicals (which produce a chemical oxidative stress), by transition metals, such as cadmium or cobalt, hydrogen peroxide, other reactive oxygen species, or heat shock are clearly different in mechanism from the up-regulation produced by metalloporphyrins (13Shan Y.

For example, earlier work from our laboratory showed that cMyc/Max and upstream stimulatory factor elements in the 5′-untranslated region of the HO-1 gene played the key role in inductions by cadmium or cobalt (11Lu T.H. Shan Y. Pepe J. Lambrecht R.W. Bonkovsky H.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2000; 209: 17-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, inductions by sodium arsenite or phenylarsene oxide depend primarily upon activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases leading to increased levels of AP-1 proteins, which bind to several AP1-consensus elements found in the HO-1 promoter (18Elbirt K.K.

In contrast, the up-regulation of the HO-1 gene produced by heme or cobalt protoporphyrin is not mediated by these classic stress pathways or kinase cascades but rather depends upon several heme-responsive elements (and a metalloporphyrin-responsive element), which are distinct from other consensus promoter elements, found in the 5′-untranslated region of rodent, human, and avian HO-1 (12Shan Y. Pepe J. Lambrecht R.W. Bonkovsky H.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Further progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the up-regulation of the HO-1 gene by heme has come from the characterization of Bach-1, one of the family of leucine b-Zip proteins. Bach-1 was isolated as a brown protein and was shown to contain heme bound to multiple cysteine-proline motifs (22Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M.

Under conditions of excess heme, increased binding of heme to Bach-1 leads to a conformational change and a decrease in DNA-binding activity. This permits other Maf-Maf, Nrf2-Maf, and other activating heterodimers to occupy the HeRE sites in the HO-1 promoter and leads to increased transcription and up-regulation of expression of the gene (24Sun J.

An additional or alternative mechanism for the heme effect, namely, a stabilization of Nrf2 proteins, which are positive transcriptional regulators of HO-1, has recently been proposed by Alam et al. (27Alam J. Killeen E. Gong P. Naquin R. Hu B. Stewart D. Ingelfinger J.R. Nath K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F743-F752Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) based upon studies with immortalized proximal tubular epithelial cells. The purpose of the work described in this paper was to investigate whether down-regulation of Bach-1 expression in human hepatocytes would lead to up-regulation of the HO-1 gene. We chose small interfering RNAs (siRNA) directed at Bach-1 as a convenient means to down-regulate the Bach-1 gene. A portion of this work has been presented in abstract form (28Shan Y. Lambrecht R.W. Ghaziani T. Donohue S. Bonkovsky H.L. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 527APubMed Google Scholar). Materials—The human hepatoma cell line, Huh-7, was purchased from the Japan Health Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). Ferric (Fe+3)-protoporphyrin IX·Cl (heme) was from Porphyrin Products (Logan, UT). Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was purchased from Fisher-Biotech (Fair Lawn, NJ). RNAzol was from Biotecx (Houston, TX). Goat anti-Bach-1, anti-β-actin polyclonal antibodies, and rabbit anti-goat IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-HO-1 monoclonal antibody (OSA-111) was purchased from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). Rabbit anti-mouse IgG and ECL-Plus were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Nonspecific control duplexes-XIII and LaminB2 duplex were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Cell Cultures and Preparation of Chemicals—Huh-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and were routinely passaged twice a week. Heme was dissolved in Me2SO and stored at –20 °C; it was further diluted with 1% human serum albumin in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) just before use. Bach-1 siRNAs Preparation and Transfection—We used Bach-1 siRNAs, targeting the following positions of the human Bach-1 mRNA (Accession Number NM_001186), 331–349, 573–591, 1673–1691, and 2296–2314. The forward sequences of Bach-1-duplex siRNAs were GAACATTACTCTTCCAGAA, AAACAGACCTTAAACTTTC, GAACAAGAATGTGAGGTAA, and GCAGATGACTGATAAATGT. All Bach-1 siRNAs were synthesized and annealed at Dharmacon. Huh-7 cells were plated the day before transfections and grown to 50–70% confluence in 12-well plates. Transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (12Shan Y. Pepe J. Lambrecht R.W. Bonkovsky H.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Shan Y. Lambrecht R.W. Hong L.T. Bonkovsky H.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were grown for 24–72 h in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and changed to serum-free medium just before heme treatment. Cells were harvested, total RNA and protein was extracted, and these samples were stored at –80 °C for subsequent quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. RNA Preparation and Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA from treated cells was extracted by applying 500 μl of RNAzol directly onto the cells and following the manufacturer's instructions with the addition of DNase digestion steps. RNA concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260/280 nm. The minimal required value of this ratio was 1.8. Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA in a total volume of 50 μl using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using an ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and QuantiTect™ SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Sequence-specific primers were designed using Applied Biosystems Primer Express software. Each assay was designed such that the product spanned an intron/exon boundary to minimize the possibility of coamplifiying genomic DNA. Primers used were as follows, for Bach-1 sense primer, 5′-GGACACTCCTTGCCAAATGCAG; Bach-1 antisense primer, 5′-TGACCTGGTTCTGGGCTCTCAC; HO-1 sense primer, 5′-CGGGCCAGCAACAAAGTG; HO-1 antisense primer, 5′-AGTGTAAGGACCCATCGGAGAA; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense primer, 5′-TTGTTGCCATCAATGACCC; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antisense primer, 5′-CTTCCCGTTCTCAGCCTTG; HO-2 sense primer, 5′-CAATGTCAGCGGAAGTGGAAAC, HO-2 antisense primer, 5′-CAGCCATTCTCATTTGGTTCTCC; ALAS-1 sense primer, 5′-GGCAGCACAGATGAATCAGAGAG, and ALAS-1 antisense primer, 5′-TTCAGCAACCTCTTTCCTCACGG; LaminB2 sense primer, 5′-AAGAAGTCCTCGGTGATGCGT-3′; LaminB2 antisense primer, 5′-TCCCCCTGTTGGTGGAAAA-3′. We included no-template controls and no-reverse transcriptase controls, which were expected to produce negligible signals (Cycle threshold values >35). Absolute standard curves of Bach-1, HO-1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were constructed with results of parallel PCRs performed on serial dilutions of standard DNA (originally generated by in vitro transcription). Input cDNA concentrations were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Protein Preparation and Western Blotting—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton 100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin). The lysed cells were sonicated for 10 s, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. Aliquots of supernatants were stored at –80 °C until Western blotting analysis. Total proteins (30–50 μg) were separated on 4–15% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). After electrophoretic transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), membranes were incubated for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody at room temperature. The dilutions of the primary antibodies were as follows: 1:200 for anti-Bach-1 antibody, 1:2000 for anti-β-actin antibody, and 1:1000 for anti-HO-1 antibody. After four washes with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (either anti-goat or anti-mouse IgG; dilution 1:10,000). Finally, the membranes were washed four times, and the bound antibodies were visualized with the ECL-Plus chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's protocol. A computerbased imaging system (Kodak, Rochester, NY) was used to measure the relative optical density of each specific band obtained after Western blotting. Data are expressed as the percentage of the control (corresponding to the value obtained with the vehicle-treated cells or nontransfected cells), which were considered 100% or one. Statistical Analyses of Data—Experiments were repeated three times. Except for Western blots, all experiments included at least triplicate samples for each treatment group. Representative results from single experiments are presented. Statistical analyses were performed with JMP 4.0.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For normally distributed data, differences in mean values were assessed by analysis of variance techniques, with the Tukey-Kramer correction for multiple pair-wise comparisons, or Dunnett's test versus a control. Nonlinear regression was analyzed with Sigmaplot 2001 (Systat, Point Richmond, CA). Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Heme-mediated Induction of HO-1 Gene Expression in Human Liver Cells—Heme is a potent inducer of HO-1 in many cell types and systems. We have previously demonstrated heme-dependent inductions of HO-1 gene expression in primary cultures of chick embryo liver cells (29Cable E. Greene Y. Healey J. Evans C.O. Bonkovsky H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Cable E.E. Gildemeister O.S. Pepe J.A. Lambrecht R.W. Bonkovsky H.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 169: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified four HeREs and one metalloporphyrin response element within the HO-1 promoter region that mediated heme-dependent activation of the HO-1 gene in chick LMH cells (12Shan Y. Pepe J. Lambrecht R.W. Bonkovsky H.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Shan Y. Pepe J. Lu T.H. Elbirt K.K. Lambrecht R.W. Bonkovsky H.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To characterize the mechanism whereby heme up-regulates HO-1 gene expression in human liver cells, we first examined HO-1 mRNA and protein levels after treatment with heme in Huh-7 cells. As expected, heme induced HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in a time-related and dose-dependent fashion (data not shown). HO-1 mRNA levels started to increase after 10 μm heme treatment for 2 h, reached a peak (∼25-fold increase) at 4–6 h, and were lower but still significantly increased (∼5-fold) after 16 h. A concentration of heme as low as 1 μm significantly up-regulated HO-1 mRNA by 18-fold, and the maximum was reached at 5–10 μm heme treatment for 4 h. The lowest concentration of heme that led to detectable up-regulation of HO-1 protein, after 4 h of treatment, was 2 μm. Thus, low concentrations of heme produce marked up-regulation of the HO-1 gene in human Huh-7 cells, as in numerous other cell types (13Shan Y. Pepe J. Lu T.H. Elbirt K.K. Lambrecht R.W.

Specifically Silencing Bach-1 Gene with Bach-1 siRNA in Huh-7 Cells—Recently, siRNAs have provided practical tools to silence gene expression in mammalian cells, opening new possibilities for studying the functions of genes and proteins. RNA interference is a highly coordinated, sequence-specific mechanism involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. siRNAs have been shown to act as the functional intermediates in RNA interference, specifically directing cleavage of complementary mRNA targets in a process that is commonly regarded to be an antiviral cellular defense mechanism (36Elbashir S.M.

Target RNA cleavage is catalyzed by the RNA-induced silencing complex, which functions as a siRNA-directed endonuclease. Using siRNA technology, we successfully reduced human Bach-1 gene expression by transfection of siRNA duplexes for Bach-1 (Bach-1 siRNA) into Huh-7 cells. Effects were analyzed and compared with those of non-Bach-1 siRNA transfection. Measuring Bach-1 mRNA concentrations in Bach-1 siRNA-transfected cells using quantitative RT-PCR, we found 100–200 nm Bach-1 siRNA at 72 h could reduce Bach-1 mRNA levels by ∼70% when compared with non-Bach-1 siRNA treated cells (Fig. 1A). We next measured Bach-1 protein concentrations in Bach-1 siRNA-transfected cells using Western blots. We found that 100–200 nm of Bach-1 siRNA reduced Bach-1 protein up to 80% at 72 h when compared with non-Bach-1 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). To confirm the specificity of silencing the Bach-1 gene by Bach-1 siRNAs, we first tested 20–100 nm LaminB2 duplex silencing LaminB2 mRNA level by quantitative RT-PCR in Huh-7 cells. The results showed that transfected 25 nm LaminB2 siRNA for 72 h reduced by 80% LaminB2 mRNA levels. We further tested Bach-1 gene expression from the cells transfected with non-Bach-1-related siRNA, e.g. nonspecific control duplexes and LaminB2 duplex. We found that there were no significant reductions of either Bach-1 mRNA or protein levels in the cells transfected with 25 and 100 nm nonspecific control duplexes and LaminB2 duplex (data shown 100 nm) when compared with cells that were not transfected (Fig. 2). Thus, we demonstrated that silencing of the human Bach-1 gene using siRNA-targeted Bach-1 mRNA was effective, specific, and selective.Fig. 2Lack of effect of nonspecific siRNAs on Bach-1 mRNA and protein levels in Huh-7 cells. Huh-7 cells were transfected with 100 nm nonspecific control duplexes, Bach-1 siRNA, or LaminB2 siRNA for 72 h, after which cells were harvested, and mRNA and protein were quantified, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Bach-1 mRNA levels.

Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K.

Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) showed that HO-1 is constitutively expressed at higher levels in many tissues of Bach-1-deficient mice, suggesting that Bach-1 acts as a negative regulator of transcription of the mouse HO-1 gene. We analyzed the effect of Bach-1 on expression of human HO-1 by silencing the Bach-1 gene in Huh-7 cells. Bach-1 siRNA significantly increased HO-1 mRNA levels in Huh-7 cells in a dose-dependent and time-related fashion (Fig. 3, A and B). The levels of HO-1 mRNA were significantly increased after exposure to 50 nm Bach-1 siRNA and reached a maximum level at 200 nm (∼7.5-fold). Induction of HO-1 mRNA expression was significant at 24 h after exposure to 100 nm Bach-1 siRNA and reached a maximum by 48 h. The expression levels of HO-1 mRNA remained increased for 72 h, and this was consistently associated with the repression of Bach-1 mRNA expression. To explore whether the increased HO-1 gene expression in the presence of Bach-1 siRNA represented a general response, we measured the levels of HO-2 and ALAS-1 mRNA in the same Bach-1 siRNA-treated cells. Bach-1 siRNA did not affect HO-2 (Fig. 3C) or ALAS-1 (Fig. 3D) mRNA levels in Huh-7 cells. Thus, these results demonstrated that Bach-1 is a repressor of the HO-1 gene in human hepatic cells, consistent with the results of Sun et al. (24Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) in mice. Regulation of HO-1 Expression by Heme and Bach-1 siRNA—We next studied the effects of combinations of heme and Bach-1 siRNA on HO-1 gene regulation in Huh-7 cells. Before testing HO-1, we first confirmed Bach-1 mRNA was repressed by more than 50% by Bach-1 siRNA. HO-1 mRNA expression levels were markedly up-regulated by treatment with a lower concentration of heme in the presence of Bach-1 siRNA and were greater for all of the heme concentrations tested (0–10 μm). Using non-linear regression analysis, the HO-1 mRNA levels were correlated with heme concentrations in the presence or absence of Bach-1 siRNA (r = 0.9, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4A). The two curves are significantly different from each other (p < 0.001) implying an additive effect of Bach-1 siRNA and heme on the up-regulation of HO-1 gene expression. As expected, HO-1 protein levels were consistent with HO-1 mRNA levels, in cells treated with heme in the presence or absence of Bach-1 siRNA (Fig. 4B). Recently, Ogawa et al. (25Ogawa K. Sun J. Taketani S. Nakajima O. Nishitani C. Sassa S. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Shibahara S. Fujita H. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and Sun et al. (24Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) reported that Bach-1 is a heme-binding protein. Heme specifically binds to four dipeptide cysteine-proline motifs of Bach-1 and, when heme is thus bound, the DNA-binding and repressive activity of Bach-1/Maf hetero-oligomers is markedly inhibited. We identified four HeREs and one metalloporphyrin response element located in the 5′-untranslated region of the chick HO-1 promoter region (39Shan Y. Lambrecht R.W. Bonkovsky H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1679: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). By sequence analysis, we found there are four homologous HeRE sites, but not a metalloporphyrin response element site, in the human HO-1 promoter region. Our results are consistent with the idea that the heme-dependent up-regulation of HO-1 is due, at least in part, to a Bach-1/heme interaction, which allows Maf/Maf recognition elements (HeREs) to regulate the gene. However, the precise mode of action whereby heme up-regulates HO-1, and the identity of the binding proteins involved remains imperfectly understood. An alternative hypothesis is that heme increases the stability of the Nrf2 protein (27Alam J. Killeen E. Gong P. Naquin R. Hu B. Stewart D. Ingelfinger J.R. Nath K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F743-F752Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) leading to accumulation of heterodimers of Nrf2/MafG that bind to the HeREs, activating the HO-1 gene. Our results showed that exogenous heme produces an additional up-regulation of HO-1, beyond that produced by Bach-1 siRNAs, suggesting that heme does not act solely through its effects on Bach-1, which is consistent with this alternative hypothesis. It seems likely that the heme-mediated induction of HO-1 is a function of both Bach-1 (via heme binding with subsequent derepression of HO-1 gene expression) and of Nrf2 (via a heme-mediated increase in stability of Nrf2 with subsequent induction of HO-1 gene expression). In summary, heme markedly induced HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in a time-related and dose-dependent fashion in human Huh-7 cells. Using siRNA technology, we specifically silenced ∼80% of the human Bach-1 gene by using four siRNAs, targeted to different locations of the human Bach-1 mRNA. Bach-1 has a specific and selective effect to repress the expression of human hepatic HO-1. The silencing of Bach-1 by siRNAs is a useful method for up-regulating HO-1 gene expression in human hepatocytes. Exogenous heme produces additional up-regulation beyond that produced by Bach-1 siRNAs, suggesting that heme does not act solely through its effects on Bach-1. We thank Dr. Henry M. Furneaux (Center for Vascular Biology, University of Connecticut Health Center) for critical discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2108933981,"We have demonstrated previously that c-Cbl requires the presence of a functional ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM) in Eps15 to mediate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) endocytosis. Both the ubiquitin ligase activity of c-Cbl and the UIM of Eps15 were necessary for plasma membrane recruitment of Eps15 and entry of ligand-bound EGFR into coated pits and vesicles containing Eps15. This is consistent with a scenario in which ubiquitin moieties appended to activated EGFR complexes act as docking sites for Eps15 and thereby recruit receptors into clathrin coated pits. Here, we have investigated which additional structural features of c-Cbl are required for this process. We find that c-Cbl can guide ligand-bound EGFR into the Eps15 internalization route by two distinct mechanisms. These are either dependent on the phosphotyrosine binding domain of c-Cbl that directly binds to the EGFR or on the region C-terminal of the Ring finger, which allows for indirect binding to an alternative site on the receptor. No strict requirement exists for either ubiquitin modified EGFR or the Cbl binding ubiquitination substrate CIN85 as docking site for the UIM of Eps15. Only in the phosphotyrosine binding-dependent pathway, the EGFR is ubiquitinated and may serve as a site of recruitment for Eps15. Only in this pathway, Eps15 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, but this appears unrelated to its capacity to participate in EGFR internalization.

Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It was first found in yeast that mono-ubiquitin can serve as an internalization and/or sorting signal for plasma membrane receptors (3Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L.

In particular, tyrosine kinase-linked receptors are ubiquitinated by a family of proteins called Cbl (5Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y.

Their second conserved feature is a Ring finger that binds ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and thereby classifies the Cbl family as ubiquitin ligase (14Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J.

Recent studies indicate that this concerns mono-ubiquitination at multiple sites, rather than poly-ubiquitination. Moreover, use of an EGFR-ubiquitin chimera showed that a single ubiquitin moiety suffices to support receptor endocytosis and degradation (20Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 21Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol.

A number of data suggested a role for Eps15 in such a pathway. First, Eps15 has a functional UIM (22Fisher R.D. Wang B. Alam S.L. Higginson D.S. Robinson H. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. J. Biol.

Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and can localize to coated pits (25Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Finally, Eps15 is involved in clathrin coat assembly, possibly by targeting AP-2 to the plasma membrane (26Carbone R. Fre S. Iannolo G. Belleudi F. Mancini P. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Di Fiore P.P.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the ubiquitin ligase function of c-Cbl served to recruit Eps15 to the activated EGFR and to promote thereby its redistribution into CCP. Our findings appeared consistent with a model based on studies in yeast (31Riezman H. Nature. 2002; 416: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), in which the ubiquitinated EGFR is recruited to CCP by interaction with the UIM of Eps15. We showed that the ubiquitin ligase function of c-Cbl was required for EGF-induced recruitment of Eps15 to the plasma membrane, where it co-localized with ligand-bound EGFR (32de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5001-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Importantly, mutation of the UIM of Eps15 abrogated the capacity of c-Cbl to promote Eps15 membrane recruitment and EGFR internalization into Eps15-containing endosomes. In the absence of the ubiquitin-UIM connection, the EGFR could still be internalized in a clathrin-dependent manner, but this proceeded via an endosomal pathway that was devoid of Eps15 (32de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5001-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our findings support a scenario in which Eps15 is recruited to the plasma membrane upon EGFR stimulation because its UIM binds to a protein within the EGFR complex that is ubiquitinated by c-Cbl. This would subsequently guide the activated EGFR into a clathrin-dependent endocytic route involving Eps15 (Fig. 1A). However, direct ubiquitin-dependent interaction of Eps15 with the EGFR could not be demonstrated. Therefore, the Eps15 docking protein might be either the EGFR or an alternative molecule. In the present study, we have examined which structural properties of c-Cbl, apart from its Ring finger, are required for internalization of the EGFR via the ubiquitin-driven Eps15 route. In particular, we have addressed the role of the N-terminal PTB domain, which allows for direct binding to phosphotyrosine Tyr(P)1045 in the activated EGFR (15Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) and the role of the C-terminal region that is present in c-Cbl and Cbl-b but not Cbl-c. The C-terminal region harbors tyrosine phosphorylation sites and proline-rich sequences and can interact with a number of signaling proteins, among which are the adaptors Grb-2 and CIN85 (33Tsygankov A.Y. Teckchandani A.M. Feshchenko E.A. Swaminathan G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6382-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Dikic I. Szymkiewicz I. Soubeyran P. Cell. Mol.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39735-39746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Via Grb-2, Cbl proteins can bind to the EGFR-independent of their PTB, at another site than Tyr(P)1045 (36Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). CIN85 is known to affect EGFR internalization, which may be related to its capacity to recruit endophilin, a protein involved in membrane curvature (37Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Alternatively or in addition, the fact that CIN85 is mono-ubiquitinated by c-Cbl (38Haglund K. Shimokawa N. Szymkiewicz I. Dikic I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12191-12196Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) may imply a role in recruitment of UIM-containing endocytic proteins such as Eps15. Our findings indicate that c-Cbl can mediate EGFR internalization via the Eps15 route by two distinct mechanisms, which are either dependent on its PTB or its C terminus. Cell Culture and Antibodies—COS-7 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal calf serum, glutamine and antibiotics. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal serum 282.7 directed against the EGFR (for blotting; Dr. L. H. Defize, Hubrecht Laboratory, Utrecht, The Netherlands); the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 528, directed against the EGFR (for precipitation; American Type Culture Collection); mouse mAb 12CA5 and HA-7 (Sigma) against the HA tag (for blotting); rat mAb 3F10 against the HA tag (for fluorescence; Roche Applied Science); mAb M2 directed against the FLAG-tag (Sigma); rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) H-896 directed against Eps15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit pAb C-15, directed against c-Cbl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mAb 4G10 against Tyr(P) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). For enhanced chemiluminescence, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or swine anti-rabbit Ig (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) were used. For immunofluorescence, affinity purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) were used. Constructs—The pMT2 expression vectors containing cDNA encoding the human EGFR, HA-tagged ubiquitin, HA-tagged c-Cbl (human), or HA-tagged 70Z-Cbl have been described previously (18de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5001-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The R829A or G306E point mutation was introduced in the pMT2HA-c-Cbl vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Using this method, the G306E mutation was also introduced in the pMT2HA-70Z-Cbl vector. The HA-tagged c-CblΔC cDNA, encoding amino acids 1–481, was obtained by digestion of pMT2-HA-c-Cbl with EagI and subsequently cloned into the NotI site of pMT2SM. A stop codon was introduced after digestion with XhoI by filling in the overhangs with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The v-Cbl construct, encoding amino acids 1–357, was made by PCR, using pGEM 4Z-c-Cbl (a gift from W. Y. Langdon, University of Western Australia) as a template and cloned into pMT2HA. The FLAG-tagged wild-type mouse Eps15 cDNA was a gift from E. Klapisz and P. van Bergen en Henegouwen (University of Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and was cloned into pMT2. Correct cloning and mutagenesis of all mutants was verified by sequencing. Transfections—COS cells (1 × 106 per 60-cm2 dish) were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method using 2.5 μg of vector containing Cbl cDNA and 1 μg of pMT2HA-ubiquitin. CHO cells (3 × 105 per 10-cm2 well) were transfected using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen), as described previously (18de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, cells (2 × 105 per 10 cm2 well) were transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Per well, a total of 2 μgof DNA was used in a ratio of 1:6 to the FuGENE solution. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were used for immunoprecipitation 48 h after transfection. COS cells were serum-starved overnight, CHO cells for 3 h, and stimulated with 25 ng/ml EGF (Becton Dickinson) at 37 °C. After stimulation, cells were put on ice, washed with cold PBS, and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C with lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μm leupeptin, and 0.1 μm aprotinin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Immunoprecipitation and blotting were performed as described (18de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Roosendaal, The Netherlands). To remove antibodies from the blot, it was incubated for 30 min at 50 °C in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol), washed three times in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and blocked for 30 min in the same buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) prior to incubation with new antibodies. Receptor Internalization Assay—Mouse EGF (Becton Dickinson) was labeled with 125I using the chloramine-T method to a specific activity of about 1 × 105 cpm/ng. Transfected cells were plated in 24-well plates and allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were cultured in medium without serum (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA) for 3 h. To measure ligand internalization, cells were incubated with 1 ng/ml 125I-EGF, in a total volume of 0.5 ml, for 0, 2, 4, and 8 min at 37 °C. Cells were put on ice to stop further internalization and washed twice with PBS to remove unbound ligand. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 2 min with PBS/HCl, pH 2.1. Samples were collected, after which cells were lysed in 1 m NaOH for 10 min. Acid wash samples representing the membrane bound ligand fractions and cell lysates representing the internalized ligand fractions were counted in a γ-counter. Immunofluorescence—One day after transfection, CHO cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA and plated on cover slips placed in 6-well plates. Cells were allowed to attach for 24 h and then serum-starved for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% BSA. After 10-min temperature adjustment of the cells on ice, Texas Red (TxR)-labeled EGF (100 ng/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was allowed to bind for 1 h on ice. Cells were stimulated at 37 °C for 0 or 2 min and fixed with cold methanol. Cells were rehydrated in PBS, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 and blocked for 30 min using 1% BSA in PBS, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2. Incubations were performed at room temperature with antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingham, CA) and viewed under a Leica TCS NT confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). To minimize spectral leak-through, three-color images were obtained by sequential scanning. Structure and Function of Cbl Domains—We have established previously that the capacity of c-Cbl to promote EGFR internalization via the Eps15 route depended on its ubiquitin ligase activity, which is determined by its Ring finger. The well characterized mutant 70Z-Cbl selectively lacks the Ring finger domain, while v-Cbl lacks the Ring finger and in addition all C-terminal sequences (Fig. 1B) (12Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse H.C. d. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar). To address the role of other c-Cbl domains in internalization of the EGFR via the Eps15 route, we made use of a number of mutants, which lacked certain N- or C-terminal features (Fig. 1B). Wild-type Cbl molecules share an N-terminal PTB domain, which is composed of a four-helix bundle, an EF-hand and an Src homology 2-like domain (13Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). With this PTB, Cbl molecules bind to receptor tyrosine kinase systems, such as the EGFR, upon their tyrosine phosphorylation following receptor triggering (Fig. 1A). Phosphotyrosine binding by this domain is disrupted by mutation of the glutamate residue at position 306 (c-CblG306E) (39Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 40Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). 70Z-CblG306E in addition lacks the Ring finger. In contrast, CblΔC has an intact PTB and Ring finger, but it lacks the C-terminal part and therefore does not bind proteins that normally associate with proline-rich sequences or phosphorylated tyrosine motifs in this region. Among these is the adaptor protein Grb-2, which binds to proline-rich regions in the C terminus of Cbl and in this way can link Cbl to the EGFR via an alternative Tyr(P) docking site (36Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The c-CblR829A mutant selectively lacks the binding site for the CIN85 adaptor protein, which is a substrate for mono-ubiquitination by c-Cbl and plays a role in c-Cbl-mediated receptor internalization (35Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Haglund K. Kowanetz M. Husnjak K. Taylor J.D. Soubeyran P. Engstrom U. Ladbury J.E. Dikic I. J. Biol.

Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). c-Cbl Only Ubiquitinates the EGFR When It Binds via Its PTB, Not When It Binds via Its C-terminal Region—First, we assessed the role of c-Cbl domains in EGFR ubiquitination. COS cells, which endogenously express EGFR, were co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and empty vector (control) or vector encoding different HA-tagged Cbl molecules. Immunoblotting on total cell lysates (TCLs) showed that similar amounts of HA-tagged Cbl were expressed in the different transfected cell populations (Fig. 2, lower panel, αHA)). Cells were stimulated with EGF for 0 or 15 min, and the EGFR was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates. Activation of the EGFR was confirmed by anti-Tyr(P) blotting on these IPs and anti-EGFR blotting confirmed that similar amounts of EGFR were isolated from the different cell populations (Fig. 2, lower panel). Anti-HA blotting on EGFR IPs revealed both HA-tagged ubiquitin and transfected Cbl molecules. Clearly, EGFR stimulation resulted in EGFR ubiquitination in control cells, which had not been transfected with Cbl (Fig. 2, upper panel). This is due to the activity of endogenous c-Cbl, which is recruited to the EGFR complex (Fig. 2, lower panel, αCbl). Transfection and consequent overexpression of wild-type c-Cbl resulted in enhanced recruitment of c-Cbl molecules to the EGFR and thereby in enhanced EGFR ubiquitination as compared with the control situation (Fig. 2, upper panel). In contrast, overexpression of the c-CblG306E mutant with a disrupted PTB domain resulted in enhanced recruitment to EGFR but did not increment EGFR ubiquitination like wild-type c-Cbl (Fig. 2, upper panel). The C-terminal sequences of c-Cbl appeared dispensable for EGFR ubiquitination, since the CblΔC mutant enhanced EGFR ubiquitination over control levels to the same extent as wild-type c-Cbl (Fig. 2, upper panel). (In the case of CblΔC its recruitment to the EGFR is difficult to see. In the anti-HA blot, the band representing this mutant migrated close to the Ig heavy chain of the antibody used for immunoprecipitation. Anti-Cbl antibody cannot recognize this mutant and therefore only reveals endogenous c-Cbl). We conclude that transfected c-Cbl lacking a functional PTB cannot promote EGFR ubiquitination. Lack of the C-terminal region, however, does not affect the capacity of Cbl to ubiquitinate the EGFR. We also tested Ring finger mutants of c-Cbl for their capacity to exert a dominant negative effect on EGFR ubiquitination by endogenous c-Cbl. The 70Z-Cbl mutant, which has both an intact PTB and an intact C-terminal region, completely overruled the function of endogenous c-Cbl and reduced EGFR ubiquitination to undetectable levels (Fig. 2, upper panel). Interestingly, the v-Cbl mutant, which can only bind to the EGFR via the PTB and not via Grb-2, since it lacks the C-terminal region, was dominant negative to the same extent as 70Z-Cbl. In contrast, 70Z-CblG306E, which has a disrupted Ring finger, but lacks the PTB, could not inhibit EGFR ubiquitination by endogenous c-Cbl (Fig. 2, upper panel). As compared with transfected wild-type c-Cbl, the Ring finger mutants were more abundantly present in EGFR complexes, which suggests reduced turnover of Cbl in the absence of its ubiquitin ligase function. We conclude that endogenous c-Cbl cannot induce EGFR ubiquitination when v-Cbl blocks the PTB binding site on the receptor. In contrast, blocking of the alternative binding site on the EGFR by the 70Z-CblG306E mutant has no such effect. Collectively, these data indicate that, under these experimental conditions, the EGFR is only ubiquitinated when c-Cbl binds to the activated receptor via its PTB but not when it binds via its C-terminal region. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Eps15 by the EGFR Requires PTB of Cbl but Not Its C-terminal Region—To establish a link between the ubiquitinated EGFR and Eps15, we examined the requirements for Eps15 phosphorylation. Eps15 is known to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon EGFR stimulation, possibly directly by the EGFR kinase domain (42Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Previously, we have used Eps15 phosphorylation as evidence for communication between the EGFR and Eps15 and found that it required the ubiquitin ligase function of c-Cbl (32de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5001-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, we now tested the effect of the N- and C-terminal Cbl mutants on Eps15 phosphorylation. CHO cells were transfected with EGFR, FLAG-Eps15, and HA-tagged wild type or mutant Cbl. Cells were stimulated with EGF for 0 or 10 min, and FLAG-Eps15 was immunoprecipitated. Controls show that similar amounts of FLAG-Eps15 and HA-Cbl were expressed in the different transfected populations (TCLs) and that similar amounts of FLAG-Eps15 were isolated from these (Fig. 3). As described in our previous study (32de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5001-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), EGFR activation in control cells expressing only endogenous c-Cbl resulted in Eps15 phosphorylation, which was enhanced by overexpression of c-Cbl (Fig. 3). In contrast, overexpression of the c-CblG306E mutant with a disrupted PTB domain did not increment Eps15 phosphorylation over control levels. The CblΔC mutant, however, enhanced Eps15 phosphorylation over control levels to the same extent as wild-type c-Cbl (Fig. 3). Interestingly, both 70Z-Cbl and v-Cbl mutants fully inhibited Eps15 phosphorylation, while 70Z-CblG306E could not overrule Eps15 phosphorylation. These data indicate that the requirements for Eps15 tyrosine phosphorylation following EGFR stimulation are the same as the requirements for EGFR ubiquitination: Eps15 is only phosphorylated when c-Cbl binds to the activated receptor via its PTB but not when it binds via its C-terminal region. Thus, ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR and tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps15 are perfectly correlated, in line with the idea that Eps15 can come into proximity of the activated EGFR by virtue of ubiquitin modification of the receptor. The PTB Domain and C Terminus of c-Cbl Can Independently Support Recruitment of Eps15 to the Plasma Membrane—To directly follow recruitment of Eps15 to the activated EGFR at the plasma membrane, we monitored the distribution of endogenous Eps15 in CHO cells by conf"

A fundamental question is how neuronal subtype specification and developmental gene expression are controlled within maturing neurons. The α6 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor (GABRA6) is preferentially expressed in cerebellar granule neurons and is part of an intrinsic program directing their differentiation. We have employed a lentiviral approach to examine the transcriptional mechanisms controlling neuronal subtype-selective expression of this gene. These studies demonstrated that nuclear factor I (NFI) proteins are required for both transgenic GABRA6 promoter activity as well as endogenous expression of this gene in cerebellar granule neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation also showed that NFI proteins are bound to the GABRA6 promoter in these cells in vivo. Furthermore, analyses of gene knockout mice revealed that Nfia is specifically required for normal expression of the GABRA6 gene in cerebellar granule neurons. NFI expression and DNA binding activity are highly enriched in granule neurons, implicating this transcription factor family in the neuronal subtype-selective expression of the GABRA6 gene. These studies define a new role for NFI proteins as neuronal subtype-enriched transcriptional regulators that participate in an intrinsic transcriptional program directing the differentiation of cerebellar granule neurons.

These studies define a new role for NFI proteins as neuronal subtype-enriched transcriptional regulators that participate in an intrinsic transcriptional program directing the differentiation of cerebellar granule neurons. Fundamental to nervous system development is the specification and maturation of diverse neuronal populations that ultimately assemble into a complex synaptic network. These events require the appropriate spatiotemporal expression of an array of different genes during development, and a critical question is the nature of the transcriptional program that controls their proper expression. Several neuron-enriched transcription factors have been directly implicated in the determination of different neuronal populations (1Bertrand N. Castro D.S. Guillemot F. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). However, much remains to be learned regarding the roles of individual trans-regulators and their interactions in directing the phenotypes of distinct neuronal subtypes at different phases of their maturation. Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) 1The abbreviations used are: CGN, cerebellar granule neuron; GABAA, α-aminobutyric acid, type A; GABAAR, GABAA receptor; GABRA6, GABAAR α6 subunit; mGABRA6, mouse GABRA6; NFI, nuclear factor I; CMV, cytomegalovirus; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; RT, reverse transcription; ChIP, chromosomal immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DIV, days in vitro.1The abbreviations used are: CGN, cerebellar granule neuron; GABAA, α-aminobutyric acid, type A; GABAAR, GABAA receptor; GABRA6, GABAAR α6 subunit; mGABRA6, mouse GABRA6; NFI, nuclear factor I; CMV, cytomegalovirus; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; RT, reverse transcription; ChIP, chromosomal immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DIV, days in vitro. elaborate a well defined terminal differentiation program (2Goldowitz D. Hamre K. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and provide an excellent model of both cell-specific and developmental regulation of neuronal differentiation. Postnatally, newly born granule neurons migrate from the premigratory zone to form the internal granule cell layer, whereupon dendrite formation and synaptic connections with excitatory mossy fibers and inhibitory Golgi type II neurons ensue. Type A α-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAAR) are present in synaptic and extrasynaptic regions of CGNs associated with inhibitory inputs from Golgi type II cells. During CGN differentiation, GABAARs undergo a maturationdependent change from mainly benzodiazepine-sensitive to benzodiazepine-insensitive forms (3Wisden W. Korpi E.R. Bahn S. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1139-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This is associated with a switch in GABAAR subunit expression wherein the α2 and α3 subunits conferring benzodiazepine sensitivity are down-regulated while the α6 subunit is induced (3Wisden W. Korpi E.R. Bahn S. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1139-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In mature CGNs, GABAARs containing the α6 subunit function mainly at extrasynaptic sites where they mediate tonic regulation of CGN excitability (4Brickley S.G. Revilla V. Cull-Candy S.G. Wisden W. Farrant M. Nature. 2001; 409: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The GABAAR α6 subunit (GABRA6) is primarily expressed in granule neurons of the cerebellum (5Kato K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, its expression in these cells is intrinsically determined (6Gao B. Fritschy J.M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 88: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Bahn S. Wisden W. Dunnett S.B. Svendsen C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2194-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, the GABRA6 gene provides an excellent opportunity to investigate intrinsic transcriptional mechanisms controlling granule neuron subtype-specific gene regulation. The nuclear factor I (NFI) family consists of four separate genes (Nfia, b, c, and x) that are implicated in the developmental regulation of gene transcription in many tissues (8Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Multiple splice variants for each NFI gene have been identified, adding further complexity to their potential functions in diverse cell types. Gene inactivation studies have demonstrated the importance of individual NFI genes in distinct organ systems, including lung formation (Nfib) (9Grunder A. Ebel T.T. Mallo M. Schwarzkopf G. Shimizu T. Sippel A.E. Schrewe H. Mech. Dev. 2002; 112: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and tooth root development (Nfic) (10Steele-Perkins G. Butz K.G. Lyons G.E. Zeichner-David M. Kim H.J. Cho M.I. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Nfia-null mice exhibit neurological defects, including agenesis of the corpus callosum, hydrocephalus, and disrupted development of midline glia (11das Neves L. Duchala C.S. Tolentino-Silva F. Haxhiu M.A. Colmenares C. Macklin W.B. Campbell C.E. Butz K.G. Gronostajski R.M. Godinho F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11946-11951Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 12Shu T. Butz K.G. Plachez C. Gronostajski R.M. Richards L.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 203-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, specific roles for these factors in neuronal maturation and function, and the specific neuronal target genes they regulate in vivo, remain unclear. The present studies demonstrate that NFI proteins are enriched in CGNs and are required for the expression of the GABRA6 gene. Cell Culture—Mouse CGNs were prepared from 6-day-old CD1 pups according to previously described procedures (13Hatten M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated cerebellar cells were prepared by trypsin-DNase digestion and mechanical trituration, and CGNs were enriched to >98% purity by using Percoll™ (Sigma) gradient centrifugation and pre-plating on poly-d-lysine-coated Petri dishes. Cells were cultured on plastic dishes or on glass coverslips coated with 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine at a density of 2 × 106/ml in Neurobasal™ medium containing B27 serum-free supplements, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.45% glucose at 37 °C/5% CO2. Mouse cortical neurons were prepared from E18 CD1 pups. Dissected cortices were digested with 0.05% trypsin at room temperature for 2 min. After mechanical trituration, the cells were plated on plastic dishes coated with 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine at a density of 2 × 106/ml in the same Neurobasal™/B27 medium used for CGNs. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and human choriocarcinoma JEG3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Protein Extraction—Nuclei were isolated from cell cultures and tissues and extracted using protocols outlined in earlier studies (14Liu F. Tokeson J. Persengiev S.P. Ebert K. Kilpatrick D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5056-5062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Whole-cell protein extraction was performed as previously described (15Beijersbergen R.L. Carlee L. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1340-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were assayed with Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) or Micro BCA™ protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The A region probe was generated by PCR using primers containing EcoRI sites: GGAATTCAAATGCTGAGCCCATTG (sense); GGAATTCTGGAGAGTCAGAGCAATG (antisense). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI, and the resulting fragment was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP using Klenow fragment. Seven overlapping competitors covering the A region (see Fig. 1 for sequences) were generated by annealing and Klenow fill-in of oligonucleotide pairs. Oligonucleotides for NFI wild-type (TTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGATAA) and NFI mutant (TTTTGGATTGAATAAAATATGATAA; mutated bases are underlined) competitors were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The binding reactions were performed as previously described (14Liu F. Tokeson J. Persengiev S.P. Ebert K. Kilpatrick D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5056-5062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using 0.5-1.25 μg of nuclear proteins. DNA competitors were used at a 100- fold molar excess relative to the DNA probe concentration. Antisera that recognize native NFI proteins (16Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6273-6282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or pre-immune rabbit serum were used for supershift assays. Specific mammalian isoforms recognized by the NFI antiserum have not been determined. Construction of Plasmids—The plasmids used for lentiviral vector production (pHR′-CMV-LUC-W-Sin18 and pHR′-CMV-LacZ-Sin18) have been previously described (17Zufferey R. Dull T. Mandel R.J. Bukovsky A. Quiroz D. Naldini L. Trono D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9873-9880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pmα 6IRES-LacZ6 containing the mouse GABRA6 (mGABRA6) promoter with additional upstream and downstream sequences (18Bahn S. Jones A. Wisden W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9417-9421Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was used for generating mGABRA6 promoter viruses. An mGABRA6 promoter-IRES fragment was isolated from pmα 6IRES-LacZ6 by partial digestion with NcoI and SphI (blunted) and inserted into pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) plasmid to yield pGL3-GABRA6-IRES. An NFI site mutant promoter fragment was generated by PCR using relevant primers (sense, CCATTCGAAGTCCGAACTAGCCGTG; antisense, CCAAATCCTTCATATTCCTCATCCCACTC) and cloned into pGL3-GABRA6-IRES via BstBI and PstI sites. The mGABRA6 promoter was removed from pGL3-GABRA6-IRES using SmaI and EcoRI to generate the promoter-less vector pGL3-IRES by re-ligation. Lentiviral plasmids containing wild-type and mutant mGABRA6 promoter-IRES-luciferase sequences as well as an IRES-luciferase reporter were prepared by digesting the relevant pGL3-IRES plasmids with MluI (blunted) and SalI and insertion of isolated fragments into pHR′-CMV-LacZ-Sin18. For protein expression, the lentiviral vector pHR′-cPPT-CMV-W-Sin18 was generated by replacing the CMV promoter and luciferase reporter gene in pHR′-CMV-LUC-W-Sin18 with the cPPT-CMV fragment from pRRL-cPPT-CMV-X-PRE-SIN (19Barry S.C. Harder B. Brzezinski M. Flint L.Y. Seppen J. Osborne W.R. Hum. Gene Ther. 2001; 12: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using NotI and XhoI. Hemagglutinin-tagged mouse NFI-A, -B, and -X fragments were released from their expression vectors (20Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI (blunted)/SalI and cloned into pHR′-cPPT-CMV-W-Sin18. The transcription regulatory domain of NFI-X was removed using AflII (blunted) and XhoI and replaced by the Drosophila engrailed transcription repressor domain (an EcoRI (blunted)/XhoI fragment derived from pENG-N (21Kessler D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13017-13022Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)) to generate dominant repressor NFI (NFI/EnR). Transduction of CGNs and Analysis of Luciferase Activity—Vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-pseudotyped lentiviruses were generated by transient co-transfection of the vector construct, the packaging construct pCMVΔ8.91 and the pMD.G vesicular stomatitis virus G protein viral envelop expression vector into 293T cells. High titer viral stocks were prepared by ultracentrifugation as previously described (22Reiser J. Gene. Ther. 2000; 7: 910-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The titers of CMV-β-Gal and NFI expressing viruses were determined by infecting JEG3 cells with a viral serial dilution (23Condit R.C. Knipe D.M. P. M. H Principles of Virus Structure. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 31-32Google Scholar) and staining 48 h later using either 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal, Fisher Biotech, Pittsburgh, PA) or hemagglutinin antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). The viral stocks for promoter constructs were titered using an human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ZeptoMetrix Corp., Buffalo, NY) as well as by analyzing genomic DNA from viral-infected JEG3 cells using competitive PCR for luciferase sequences (sense, ATACGCCCTGGTTCCTG; antisense, AATGCCCATACTGTTGAGC). For analysis of endogenous gene expression, CGNs were transduced with lentiviral expression vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 2. For promoter studies, CGNs were infected using a multiplicity of infection of 0.2-0.5. In co-infection studies, expression viruses were added at 1/10th the concentration of the promoter virus. Luciferase activity was determined in triplicate samples, and the results of at least three independent experiments were averaged to determine the mean ± S.D. for luciferase activity. The Students t test was used for statistical analysis. Semi-quantitative and Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from tissues and cells using Tri reagent (Sigma). First strand cDNAs were synthesized with oligo-dT12-18 primers or random hexamers using the SuperScript™ RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). Primers for semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays are listed in the Supplemental Table. 18 S rRNA was assayed for normalization purposes, and serial dilutions were used to confirm linearity of the reactions. For real-time PCR, whole brain cDNA samples from three individual wild-type and Nfia knockout mice (P16) (11das Neves L. Duchala C.S. Tolentino-Silva F. Haxhiu M.A. Colmenares C. Macklin W.B. Campbell C.E. Butz K.G. Gronostajski R.M. Godinho F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11946-11951Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) were analyzed in duplicate with the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green I (Applied Biosystems). Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase mRNA (sense, GTTCTTTGCTGACCTGCTGGA; antisense, TCCCCCGTTGACTGATCATT) was used as an internal reference for normalization of GABRA6 (sense, TGGAGCGGAGATTGTTGTG; antisense, CAGGCGTCGATTTTAAGATGG) transcripts. The specificity of primers was confirmed by sequencing the RT-PCR products. Experiments were repeated twice. The ratio of transcripts for GABRA6 relative to hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase was determined using the 2-Δct method as previously described (24Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123232) Google Scholar). The Student t test was used for statistical analysis. Immunohistochemistry and Western Blotting—Mouse brains were fixed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cerebella were dissected and kept in fixative for 10 h followed by overnight incubation in 30% sucrose at 4 °C. Frozen sections (16 μm) were examined for NFI proteins using anti-NFI antibody (sc-5567, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (1:400) that recognizes all NFI isoforms containing the NFI DNA binding domain. Antibodies to GABRA6 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used at a 1:400 dilution. Bound antibodies were detected using Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (for fluorescence) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Chemicon) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein extracts were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The buffer used for dilution of antibodies and the blocking step was 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. Primary antibody for NFI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added at 1:1000 dilution, and the blot was incubated at 4 °C for overnight. Bound antibodies were detected with a Western Lightning Chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assays were performed as previously described (25Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA-binding proteins were cross-linked to DNA by adding formaldehyde (1% final concentration) directly to the culture medium and incubating for 10 min at 37 °C. Cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine (125 mm), and the cells were collected and lysed in SDS buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture mix). Chromatin was sonicated to an average length of ∼600 bp, and the NFI antibody used in supershift assays was added to the lysate. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitated chromatin was treated with proteinase K and RNase A followed by overnight incubation to reverse the crosslinking. DNA was extracted and used as template for PCR assay of the mouse GABRA6 promoter (see Fig. 1 for primer regions) or mouse brain factor-2 genomic sequences (sense, GGGGTTGGTTTCGTTC; antisense, AAGTCAGGGTTGCAGCATAG) as a negative control. Identification of CGN-enriched Nuclear Proteins That Bind to the GABRA6 Promoter—Developmental and neuronal subtype-specific regulation of the mouse GABRA6 gene is largely determined at the level of gene transcription (18Bahn S. Jones A. Wisden W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9417-9421Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mouse GABRA6 promoter lacks a consensus TATA box and initiates transcription from multiple sites spanning 50-90 bp (26McLean P.J. Shpektor D. Bandyopadhyay S. Russek S.J. Farb D.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Jones A. Bahn S. Grant A.L. Kohler M. Wisden W. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To screen for nuclear factors that might control GABRA6 expression in mouse CGNs, EMSAs were performed using multiple probes spanning different segments (150-200 bp in length) of the proximal promoter and 5′-flanking regions of the mouse gene. Nuclear extracts from adult and postnatal day-15 (P15) mouse cerebella, both of which express the GABRA6 gene (28Zheng T. Santi M.R. Bovolin P. Marlier L.N. Grayson D.R. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1993; 75: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), were compared with those from adult and P15 mouse cortex, which do not. This permitted an assessment of DNA binding factors potentially mediating expression of GABRA6 selectively in CGNs. One of these genomic segments (Fig. 1, region A) was bound by a prominent complex that was greatly enriched in cerebellar relative to cortical extracts (Fig. 2A). This 160-bp segment spans the proximal promoter region, including the majority of the transcription initiation sites (Fig. 1). The complex was specifically competed by homologous unlabeled competitor DNA but not unrelated sequences (not shown). We next examined whether these complexes also were present in nuclear extracts from cultured CGNs. GABRA6 gene expression is readily detectable in differentiated CGNs cultured for 6 days in vitro (6 DIV) (29Lin X. Bulleit R.F. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 220: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which was confirmed in the cultures used here (data not shown). EMSAs confirmed that nuclear extracts from 6 DIV CGNs also contained abundant amounts of the specific cerebellar-enriched A probe complex (Fig. 2B). Next, competitive EMSAs were used to localize the binding site(s) for the CGN complexes within the A region. Seven overlapping competitors were tested (Fig. 1, A1A-A6), only one of which, A3, competed well for binding of 6 DIV CGN extracts to this region (Fig. 3A). Further, specific binding to this region was confirmed in EMSAs using an A3 DNA probe and CGN extracts (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 1, the A3 sequence contained consensus elements for two factors, NFI and Oct-1. In competition EMSAs, NFI consensus sequences fully competed for binding to the CGN complexes observed with either the A or A3 probes (Fig. 3B), whereas Oct-1 sequences did not (data not shown). Furthermore, mutation of the NFI binding site within either the NFI consensus competitor or the A3 sequence (not shown) resulted in loss of competition (Fig. 3B). Supershift assays were performed to determine whether the CGN-enriched A probe complexes contained NFI proteins. A shifted complex was formed by the addition of antiserum that recognizes native mammalian NFI DNA-protein complexes (16Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6273-6282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas control serum did not (Fig. 3C). Thus, NFI proteins specifically bind to an NFI consensus site within the mouse GABRA6 proximal promoter and are enriched in CGN cultures that express the GABRA6 gene. Competitive EMSAs and supershift assays also confirmed that the A probe complexes that were highly enriched in the P15 cerebellum (Fig. 2A) recognized NFI consensus sequences and contained NFI proteins (data not shown). The presence of NFI proteins in differentiated CGN cultures was further demonstrated by Western analysis (Fig. 3D). Two predominant NFI proteins were detected (∼62 and 53 kDa), which may represent different NFI family members. This question was not further investigated here. NFI Directly Regulates a Stably Integrated GABRA6 Promoter in CGNs—Promoter studies were initiated to examine the interaction between the mouse GABRA6 promoter and NFI proteins in cultured CGNs. Lentiviruses were employed because these vectors transduce postmitotic mouse CGNs with high efficiency and without significantly altering their differentiation, including the expression of GABRA6. 2W. Wang and D. L. Kilpatrick, unpublished observations. They also provide a means for expressing promoters as integrated transgenes within a more physiological, chromatin environment. Lentiviruses were generated that express a luciferase reporter under the control of either wild-type mouse GABRA6 genomic sequences or a mutant version harboring an inactive NFI site (Fig. 4A). We used a genomic fragment containing ∼1 kb of 5′-flanking sequence, exons 1-8, and intervening introns of the mouse GABRA6 gene that are required for faithful and robust CGN-specific promoter activity in vivo (18Bahn S. Jones A. Wisden W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9417-9421Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Infection of mouse CGN cultures confirmed that the wild-type promoter was expressed in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Mutation of the NFI binding site resulted in essentially complete loss of promoter activity in CGNs (Fig. 4A), indicating that this site and its cognate NFI proteins are critical determinants of GABRA6 transcription. To further confirm this, lentiviral vectors were generated that express a dominant repressor form of NFI comprising the NFI-X DNA binding domain fused to the repressor domain for Drosophila engrailed (NFI/EnR) (Fig. 4B). Dominant repressor NFI/EnR strongly suppressed GABRA6 promoter activity when compared with control LacZ and EnR-alone expressed proteins (Fig. 4B). This directly implicated endogenous NFI as a critical regulator of the GABRA6 promoter in CGNs. Lentiviral vectors expressing wild-type NFI-B, NFI-A, and NFI-X proteins produced only a weak, insignificant stimulation of GABRA6 promoter activity (Fig. 4B and data not shown). Possible explanations for this are that NFI proteins are not greatly limiting for GABRA6 promoter activation in CGNs, or that one or more important co-regulators of NFI are limiting. NFI Factors Regulate Endogenous GABRA6 Gene Expression in Mouse CGN Cultures—To establish the role of NFI in regulating endogenous GABRA6 transcription, CGN cultures were infected with lentiviruses expressing dominant repressor NFI/EnR or NFI-X at multiplicity of infection 2, which results in >80% transduction of CGN cultures (data not shown). NFI/EnR strongly inhibited the expression of the endogenous GABRA6 gene, whereas glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression was unaffected (Fig. 4C). In contrast, NFI-X induced a slight increase in GABRA6 transcript abundance, similar to the effects of NFI proteins on transgene promoter activity. Together these findings indicated that NFI is an important regulator of GABRA6 gene transcription in CGNs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were next used to determine whether NFI proteins interact with the mouse GABRA6 promoter in differentiated CGNs in vivo. Primers were chosen that specifically amplified the proximal GABRA6 promoter region containing the NFI response element (see Fig. 1). Analysis of 6 DIV cultures using NFI antibodies demonstrated strong and specific NFI binding to this promoter region (Fig. 4D). Thus, NFI proteins directly interact with the endogenous GABRA6 promoter in CGNs, further supporting their importance in the physiological regulation of the GABRA6 gene. NFI Gene Expression and DNA Binding Activity Are Enriched in CGNs—EMSAs showed that NFI DNA-binding complexes were elevated in P15 mouse cerebellum relative to cortex (see Fig. 2A), suggesting that this factor is involved in region-specific gene expression within the brain. Furthermore, the NFI binding site is located within a region of the GABRA6 gene previously implicated in its CGN-specific expression (26McLean P.J. Shpektor D. Bandyopadhyay S. Russek S.J. Farb D.H.

First, immunohistochemistry demonstrated that NFI proteins were concentrated in mature CGNs within the internal granule cell layer (Fig. 5A), whereas staining in Purkinje and other cell types was much lower. Thus, CGNs are the major site of NFI expression within the adult mouse cerebellum. Next, we compared the expression of NFI in cortical neurons, which do not express the GABRA6 gene, relative to CGNs. EMSAs revealed that NFI complexes were very low in nuclear extracts from 6 DIV cortical neurons (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, transcript levels for all NFI isoforms were substantially reduced in cortical neurons as compared with CGNs (Fig. 6B). These findings suggested that differential expression of NFI proteins was an important determinant of the selective expression of the GABRA6 gene in CGNs. Lentiviral promoter studies confirmed that the GABRA6 promoter was essentially inactive in infected cortical neurons (Fig. 6C). Co-expressed wild-type versions of different NFI family members did not increase promoter activity in cortical cultures (data not shown), indicating that additional cell-specific factors or mechanisms also are required for CGN-specific activation of the GABRA6 promoter by NFI proteins. GABRA6 Expression in CGNs Requires NFI-A—NFI-A was originally identified as a cerebellar-enriched NFI protein (30Inoue T. Tamura T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19065-19070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutant mice lacking this gene exhibit neurological defects (11das Neves L. Duchala C.S. Tolentino-Silva F. Haxhiu M.A. Colmenares C. Macklin W.B. Campbell C.E. Butz K.G. Gronostajski R.M. Godinho F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11946-11951Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, a direct role for NFI-A in cerebellar development has not been previously reported. We therefore examined the expression of GABRA6 in the cerebellum of Nfia-null mice at P16-P17, when GABRA6 expression becomes predominant in mouse CGNs. Immunohistochemistry revealed a marked decline in GABRA6 staining within the internal granule cell layer of Nfia-null mice relative to wild-type (Fig. 7A). This effect was not limited to certain neuronal sub-populations but occurred generally among CGNs. Furthermore, a partial decline in GABRA6 expression also was detectable in the cerebellum of Nfia (±) mice, indicating a gene dosage effect on receptor expression. Quantitation of these effects using real-time PCR of total RNA from P16 mouse brain showed that the Nfia-null mutation resulted in a 4-fold decline in GABRA6 transcripts relative to wild-type controls (Fig. 7B). Thus, NFI-A is a critical regulator of the in vivo expression of the GABRA6 gene in the mouse cerebellum. NFI interacts with the promoters for numerous cell-specific and developmentally expressed genes in a diverse range of cell types, including neurons (31Chu H.M. Fischer W.H. Osborne T.F. Comb M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2721-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Adams A.D. Choate D.M. Thompson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6975-6983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Behrens M. Venkatraman G. Gronostajski R.M. Reed R.R. Margolis F.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1372-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gene knockout studies have demonstrated the necessity for Nfia in CNS midline glia formation (12Shu T. Butz K.G. Plachez C. Gronostajski R.M. Richards L.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 203-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, clearly defined roles and in vivo target genes for NFI proteins during neuronal differentiation remain elusive. To our knowledge, GABRA6 is the first neuronal gene shown to be a direct target of NFI in vivo. The present studies directly implicate NFI proteins as neuronal subtype-enriched transcriptional regulators of the GABRA6 gene in CGNs. Using a combination of functional approaches, we found that an NFI site within the GABRA6 proximal promoter is essential for its transcriptional activation in differentiated CGNs, and endogenous NFI proteins associate with this promoter in vivo and are important for GABRA6 gene expression in these cells. Furthermore, analyses of knockout mice showed that NFI-A is specifically required for GABRA6 gene activation. Residual expression of GABRA6 mRNA and protein in Nfia-knockout mice may reflect contributory roles for other NFI family members in regulating this gene. Expression of NFI-C, -B, and -X genes also is elevated in CGNs along with NFI-A, and thus these proteins may participate in GABRA6 gene regulation. Preliminary analyses of Nfic-null mice have found no major alterations in CGN expression of GABRA6 (data not shown), suggesting that this family member does not play a critical role. The involvement of NFIB and NFIX in GABRA6 expression cannot be assessed in knockout mice at this time, because Nfib-null animals die perinatally and Nfix-deficient mice are currently not available. CGNs provide an excellent model for examining cell-intrinsic mechanisms responsible for neuronal subtype specification and the regulation of neuronal maturation. Based on transplantation studies, CGN progenitors in the postnatal cerebellum are already committed (34Jankovski A. Rossi F. Sotelo C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2308-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Carletti B. Grimaldi P. Magrassi L. Rossi F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7132-7146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus much of their differentiation program is intrinsically driven. This includes initial cell polarization and cell migration events (36Yacubova E. Komuro H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5966-5981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yamasaki T. Kawaji K. Ono K. Bito H. Hirano T. Osumi N. Kengaku M. Development. 2001; 128: 3133-3144PubMed Google Scholar) and the expression of differentiation-related genes (7Bahn S. Wisden W. Dunnett S.B. Svendsen C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2194-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 29Lin X. Bulleit R.F. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 220: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), including GABRA6. For example, GABRA6 expression persists in transplanted CGNs developing within ectopic CNS locations (7Bahn S. Wisden W. Dunnett S.B. Svendsen C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2194-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Similarly, granule neurons of HNF-3β transgenic mice migrate inappropriately and do not form a normal internal granule cell layer, yet continue to express GABRA6 (38Zhou H. Hughes D.E. Major M.L. Yoo K. Pesold C. Costa R.H. Gene Expr. 2001; 9: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Numerous studies also have shown that the expression of GABRA6 is retained in isolated CGN cultures (6Gao B. Fritschy J.M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 88: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Lin X. Bulleit R.F. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 220: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that NFI is an integral part of the intrinsic program directing CGN differentiation through its regulation of the GABRA6 gene. Several transcription factors are involved in CGN lineage specification (reviewed in Ref. 39Hatten M.E. Alder J. Zimmerman K. Heintz N. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), including RU49/Zipro1, Engrailed-2, and Math1. NFI-A was originally identified as a cerebellar-enriched form of NFI (30Inoue T. Tamura T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19065-19070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the present studies show that all NFI family members are expressed at elevated levels in CGNs. These results along with our functional studies implicate NFI in the neuronal subtype-specific expression of the GABRA6. The inability of exogenous NFI proteins to stimulate GABRA6 promoter activity in cortical neurons raises the possibility that additional, possibly CGN-enriched cofactors also are required for subtype-specific expression. This may involve transcription factors acting through other, as yet undefined regulatory regions of the GABRA6 gene. Interactions between NFI proteins and transcriptional co-regulators have been directly implicated in cell-specific gene regulation in several tissues and cell types (40Mink S. Hartig E. Jennewein P. Doppler W. Cato A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4906-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 41Ortiz L. Aza-Blanc P. Zannini M. Cato A.C. Santisteban P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). NFI family members have been implicated in gene regulation within several neuronal types, including olfactory (33Behrens M. Venkatraman G. Gronostajski R.M. Reed R.R. Margolis F.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1372-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and cortical and midbrain neurons (20Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, the enriched expression of NFI genes in CGNs suggests a specialized role in the differentiation and function of these cells. As discussed above, NFI sites are frequently found in gene promoters. These factors therefore may have a broader role in CGN differentiation, regulating multiple genes. Different NFI family members also may possess distinct, complementary functions in CGNs. Future analyses of NFI-null mice as well as dominant-negative studies will provide deeper insight into the roles and target genes for NFI proteins during the maturation of CGNs. The present findings also demonstrate that lentiviruses can serve as effective vectors for these studies. In particular, they provide highly efficient expression of both transcriptional regulators and transgene promoters in primary neurons. These approaches should provide further insight into the transcriptional mechanisms controlling neuronal specification and maturation. We thank George Gagnon and Kenneth G. Butz for their excellent technical assistance with many aspects of this work, and Dr. Matthew Poulin and Shobhana Gupta for their initial contributions.

The biogenesis of c-type cytochromes is a complex post-translational modification process that occurs in different ways in different organisms (1Allen J.W. Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J.

The maturation process involves the transport of the apocytochrome into the periplasm by the Sec pathway (4Thöny-Meyer L. Kunzler P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the transmembrane transport of heme to the periplasm from its site of synthesis in the cytoplasm, and the stereochemically controlled step of covalent heme attachment to the apocytochrome. Thioether bonds are formed between the cysteines of a CXXCH motif in the protein and the vinyl groups of heme. A disulfide isomerization system is also present to ensure that the cysteine side chains in the apocytochrome are reduced prior to heme attachment (5Fabianek R.A. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 303-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A central protein in the maturation process is the heme chaperone CcmE, which has been shown to bind heme covalently via a histidine residue before transferring the heme to the apocytochrome (6Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The structures of two apo-forms of CcmE have been solved (7Enggist E. Thöny-Meyer L. Guntert P. Pervushin K. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1551-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Arnesano F. Banci L. Barker P.D. Bertini I. Rosato A. Su X.C. Viezzoli M.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13587-13594Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), revealing a two-domain structure with a β-barrel core and a flexible C-terminal domain. The heme-binding histidine residue lies at the junction of these two domains, and its position suggests that heme binds to the surface of the protein. This is an unusual feature when compared with classical heme-binding proteins, most of which bind heme in a solvent-shielded pocket within the protein. Heme binding on the surface of CcmE is, however, consistent with its dynamic function as a heme chaperone in that it is required to bind heme transiently and to release it to apocytochromes. CcmE is a member of the oligo-binding protein family (9Agrawal V. Kishan K.V. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2003; 4: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in terms of its structure. These oligo-binding proteins have a common function in binding and releasing non-protein molecules, which is consistent with the known functions of CcmE. Covalent heme attachment to a histidine side chain of a protein has been described for an algal Hb variant that contains a bis-His coordinated heme covalently bound to the protein through the Nϵ2 of a histidine and the 2-vinyl group of the heme (10Vu B.C. Jones A.D. Lecomte J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 8544-8545Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Efforts to solve the structure of the heme-bound form of CcmE have not yet succeeded. Complications due to insolubility of the reduced holo-protein and paramagnetism of the ferric form may have hampered NMR experiments. The apparent conformational flexibility of the protein may explain why crystallization of CcmE has not been reported. Therefore, the only information at present on the nature of the heme ligation in holo-CcmE is limited to UV-visible spectra (6Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20500-20506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which suggest that the heme adopts a high spin state in the ferric form and a 6-coordinate low spin state in the ferrous form. The difference in the heme ligation between the two redox states suggests a working hypothesis for the function of the protein, particularly regarding the control of heme binding and release according to the redox state of the heme iron. In this work, we present the first detailed spectroscopic analysis of CcmE, which provides insight into the structure of the protein at the heme binding site. Studies of a variant of the protein with Tyr134 mutated to Phe suggest that the tyrosine residue is involved in heme ligation. We also present evidence for the presence of the heme-histidine covalent bond comparing the resonance Raman (RR) spectra of holo-CcmE with those of a non-covalent complex of CcmE (expressed in the apo-form in the E. coli cytoplasm) and Fe-protoporphyrin IX (12Stevens J.M. Daltrop O. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20500-20506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—A pET22b-based (Novagen) CcmE expression vector used previously (11Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was modified to include a thrombin cleavage site between the protein and the C-terminal His tag. This was performed using the ExSite mutagenesis system (Stratagene) with the primers 5′-CGCGGCAGCGGCCACCACCACCACCACCACTGAGATCCGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGCACCAGGCCTGATGCTGGGTCCTTATAAACACTCGCC-3′ (reverse). The insertion included an additional Gly on either end of the protease recognition site and produced the plasmid pE225. The Y134F variant of CcmE was made using the Quik-Change mutagenesis method (Stratagene) with the primers 5′-CACGATGAAAACTTTACGCCGCCAGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTCTGGCGGCGTAAAGTTTTCATCGTG-3′ (reverse) and the plasmid pE225 (described above) as the template to produce the plasmid pE226. The plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the constructs were correct. Protein Expression and Purification—The E. coli strain JM109 (DE3) was used for protein expression. Holo-CcmE proteins were produced by co-expressing the plasmids described above with the plasmid pEC86, which carries the entire ccm operon (13Arslan E. Schulz H. Zufferey R. Kunzler P. Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Prof L. Thöny-Meyer (Zürich, Switzerland). The expression of the other Ccm proteins is necessary for the expression of holo-CcmE. Cultures were first grown to mid-log phase at 37 °C following inoculation and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown overnight at 28 °C. Proteins were purified as described previously (11Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thrombin digestion was performed using a CleanCleave kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the uncleaved protein was separated from the cleaved protein by reapplying the protein mixture to a Ni2+-chelating Sepharose column. The presence of the covalently bound heme was found to inhibit the digestion step with thrombin as the process was much slower than that observed for the apo-form of the protein. ApoCcmE was produced as described previously (12Stevens J.M. Daltrop O. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20500-20506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the non-covalent complex with heme was produced by the addition of a 5-fold excess of protein to ∼50 μm hemin (Sigma; from a 1 m m stock in dimethylsulphoxide). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and the protein was stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl throughout. The protein referred to in this work as CcmE refers to the soluble form of CcmE that lacks its membrane anchor, as described (11Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Protein Characterization—Discontinuous SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) was used to analyze the proteins, and staining for covalently bound heme was performed according to the method of Goodhew et al. (14Goodhew C.F. Brown K.R. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 288-294Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Visible absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 2 spectrophotometer using 2–5 μm protein solutions in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl. Protein samples were reduced by the addition of a small amount of solid sodium dithionite. Pyridine hemochrome spectra were obtained according to the method of Bartsch (15Bartsch R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) using 5 μm protein in 19% (v/v) pyridine and 0.15 m NaOH. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed using a Micromass Bio-Q II-ZS triple quadrupole atmospheric pressure mass spectrometer into which 10-μl protein samples in 1:1 water: acetonitrile, 1% formic acid at a concentration of 20 pmol/μl were injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Visible RR spectra were obtained with a single polychromator (Jobin Yvon, SPEX750M) equipped with a liquid N2-cooled CCD detector (Roper Scientific, Spec10:400B/LN). The excitation wavelengths used were 413.1 and 568.2 nm from a krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics, BeamLok 2060) and 363.8 nm from an argon ion laser (Spectra Physics, BeamLok 2080). The laser power at the sample point was adjusted to ∼5 milliwatts for the reduced and air-oxidized samples and to 0.1 milliwatts for the CO-bound form to prevent photodissociation of the CO. Raman shifts were calibrated with indene, CCl4, acetone, and an aqueous solution of ferrocyanide, and the accuracy of the peak positions of the well defined Raman bands was ± 1 cm–1. The UV RR spectra were obtained as described previously (16Aki M. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 10765-10774Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). UV light at 244 nm was produced from an intracavity frequency doubled argon ion laser (Coherent, Inova300C FreD). The laser power at the sample point was about 0.2 milliwatts. The scattered light was dispersed with a single monochromator (Jobin Yvon, SPEX1269M) equipped with an intensified CCD camera (Roper Scientific, PI-MAX 1024Cs-Te). All measurements were performed at room temperature with a spinning cell. The protein concentrations for visible and UV RR measurements were about 20 and 50 μm, respectively, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl. The wild-type and variant proteins were shown to be pure and lacking the affinity tags by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown) and of expected masses (for apo-protein) determined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (wild type, observed 15,001 Da, expected 15,002 Da; Y134F, observed 14,985 Da, expected 14,986 Da). Purified CcmE produced under the conditions described contained a substantial amount of apo-protein; usually about 20% of the protein contained covalently attached heme as determined by comparing the ratio of the absorbance value at 280 nm (apoprotein + holo-protein) with the intensity of the Soret band (holo-protein). The co-production of large amounts of apoprotein with holo-protein has been observed previously with CcmE (6Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Only the apo-forms of the proteins produced were observed in the mass spectra; the heme-containing form does not appear in the spectra under these conditions. The covalent attachment of heme to these proteins was confirmed by heme-staining SDS-PAGE gels (not shown). UV-visible Spectroscopic Analysis—Fig. 1 shows spectra of the wild-type (A) and Y134F variant (B) of holo-CcmE in both the ferric and the ferrous forms. It is clear that the spectra of the Y134F variant are significantly different from those of the wild type. The ferrous form of the wild type shows a characteristic spectrum of a c-type cytochrome, whereas that of the Y134F protein does not have the characteristic α- and β-bands. This indicates that a significant change has occurred in the heme ligation in the absence of Tyr134. The origin of the peak observed at about 650 nm for the Y134F protein has not been elucidated. The α-band in the pyridine hemochrome spectra of both the wild-type and the Y134F proteins was observed at 551 nm (data not shown). This wavelength would normally suggest that both of the vinyl groups of the heme were modified (as in a c-type cytochrome), although the uncertainty of this observation was noted previously for the heme-attached form of CcmE (6Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman Spectra of Wild-type Holo-CcmE—Fig. 2 shows RR spectra of holo-CcmE with excitation at 413.1 nm. The spectrum of the ferric protein shows a distinct ν3 band at 1492 cm–1, which is characteristic of a five-coordinate (5c) high spin (HS) heme (spectrum a). When the holo-CcmE protein is reduced, however, the spectrum shows different spin state marker bands (ν3 = 1493 cm–1 and ν2 = 1588 cm–1, spectrum b), which suggest that the heme iron is in a 6c low spin (LS) state. These observations are consistent with the UV-visible data shown above. The frequencies for the ferrous form are close to those of the CO-bound form (1497 and 1593 cm–1, respectively) shown at the top of the figure. To confirm the coordination of the CO-form, we observed the Fe–CO and C–O stretching modes for CO-bound holo-CcmE. Fig. 3 shows RR spectra in the low (left panel) and high frequency (right panel) regions. Two CO-isotope sensitive bands were observed at 496 cm–1 (487 cm–1 with 13C18O) and 1966 cm–1 (1871 cm–1 with 13C18O). Since these frequencies and isotope shifts are consistent with those observed for other heme proteins, we assigned the two bands at 496 and 1966 cm–1 to the Fe–CO and C–O stretching modes, respectively. The weak isotope-sensitive band observed at 577/557 cm–1 for the 12C16O/13C18O-bound forms arises from the Fe-C–O bending mode. The correlation plot for the ν(Fe–CO) versus ν(C–O) frequencies is illustrated in Fig. 4. These values have been characterized for a number of proteins and depend on the nature of the proximal ligand of the heme (17Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem.

Since the ν(Fe–CO) and ν(C–O) values for holo-CcmE fall on the line for proteins with a proximal histidine ligand, this plot strongly suggests the coordination of a His residue to heme in CO-bound holo-CcmE.Fig. 4Plot of vFe–CO frequencies against vC–O frequencies observed for CO-bound hemoproteins.

Li X.-Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. III. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 1-37Google Scholar), and three modes (ν10, ν11, and ν19) are expected in the 1500–1700 cm–1 region. The polarized RR spectra of ferrous holo-CcmE excited at 568.2 nm are shown in Fig. 5. Since ν19 is the sole anomalously polarized band in this region, we can easily distinguish it by polarization analysis. The band at 1587 cm–1 is anomalously polarized and assigned to ν19, whereas the bands at 1536 and 1629 cm–1 are depolarized and assigned to ν11 and ν10, respectively. The ν10 frequency is significantly upshifted as compared with that of reduced cytochrome c3, which has a bis-His coordinated heme (1619 cm–1) (21Verma A.L. Kimura K. Nakamura A. Yagi T. Inokuchi H. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 6617-6623Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ν11 frequency of holo-CcmE is significantly lower. The ν11 band is known to serve as a π -electron marker and is sensitive to the donor strength of the axial ligand, especially in the ferrous state (22Desbois A. Lutz M. Eur. Biophys. J. 1992; 20: 321-335Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Gao F. Qin H. Knaff D.B. Zhang L. Yu L. Yu C.A. Gray K.A. Daldal F. Ondrias M.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9751-9758Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The lower frequency of ν11 for holo-CcmE as compared with that of cytochrome c3 (1540 cm–1) suggests that an anionic ligand such as imidazolate or tyrosinate is coordinated to the heme in the ferrous form of holo-CcmE. Near UV-excited Resonance Raman Spectra—Fig. 6 shows the low frequency region of the UV RR spectra of holo-CcmE (spectrum a) and the Y134F variant (spectrum b) excited at 363.8 nm. It has been reported that the Fe-Tyr stretching mode is observed at ∼590 cm–1 upon 488-nm excitation for Hb and myoglobin (Mb) mutants in which the proximal His is replaced with Tyr (25Nagai M. Yoneyama Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Egeberg K.D. Springer B.A. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Morikis D. Champion P.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9783-9791Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Adachi S. Nagano S. Ishimori K. Watanabe Y. Morishima I. Egawa T. Kitagawa T. Makino R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). When 488- and 514-nm excitation wavelengths were applied to holo-CcmE, such a vibration was not observed (data not shown). However, on excitation at 363.8 nm, a band was detected at 600 cm–1 for wild-type holo-CcmE (Fig. 6, spectrum a) that was absent from the spectrum of the Y134F variant (spectrum b). Although it is known that 363.8-nm excitation gives an Fe-Cys stretching mode around 350 cm–1 for Cys-bound ferric 5cHS hemes (28Champion P.M. Stallard B.R. Wagner G.C. Gunsalus I.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 5469-5472Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 29Bangcharoenpaurpong O. Champion P.M. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 87: 4273-4284Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the observed frequency (600 cm–1) is too high to assign it to the Fe–S stretching mode, and the soluble domain of CcmE studied in this work contains no Cys residues. Considering that the 600 cm–1 band was not observed for the holo-Y134F variant and is in good agreement with those observed for proximal Tyr variants of Hb and Mb (578–603 cm–1), it is likely that this band arises from the Fe-Tyr stretching mode. Resonance Raman Spectra of the Y134F Variant of Holo-CcmE—RR spectra of the Y134F variant excited at 413.1 nm are shown in Fig. 7. The quality of the spectra is hampered by strong fluorescence. The spin state marker band, ν3, was observed faintly at ∼1468 cm–1 for the reduced protein (Fig. 7, spectrum b), although it was clearly observed at 1493 cm–1 for the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). The low frequency shift of ν3 in the reduced Y134F protein is due to the presence of 5cHS heme, which suggests that the replacement of Tyr134 with Phe induces a change in heme coordination from 6c to 5c. 2We attempted to observe the Fe-His stretching mode of the Y134F variant with 441.6-nm excitation but were unsuccessful due to strong fluorescence. This result suggests that Tyr134 could be an axial ligand of the heme in the wild type. The RR spectra of the ferric (spectrum a) and CO-bound (spectrum c) forms of the Y134F variant are also distinctly different from those of wild-type protein shown in Fig. 2, meaning that the heme coordination is significantly perturbed by this mutation. UV Resonance Raman Spectra—To confirm the coordination of Tyr134 to the heme in holo-CcmE, we measured the 244 nm-excited UV RR spectra. It is known that free deprotonated Tyr has an absorption maximum at ∼250 nm, and accordingly, the excitation wavelength of 244 nm is suitable for the observation of tyrosinate coordination to a heme (30Harada I. Takeuchi H. Clark J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems. 13. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Google Scholar). In fact, in the UV RR spectra, the Raman bands of tyrosine are observed at 1619 (Y8a, ring C–C stretch), 1208 (Y7a, CβCα stretch), and 1177 (Y9a, ring C–H bend) cm–1, whereas its deprotonation causes frequency shifts of the bands from 1619 and 1177 to 1603 and 1173 cm–1, respectively (31Harada I. Miura T. Takeuchi H. Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Spectrosc. 1986; 42: 307-312Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 32Nagai M. Aki M. Li R. Jin Y. Sakai H. Nagatomo S. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13093-13105Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 shows the 244-nm excited UV RR spectra of holo wild-type (spectrum a) and Y134F (spectrum b) proteins. Three intense bands derived from Tyr were observed at 1177, 1207, and 1615 cm–1 with a shoulder at 1603 cm–1 for wild-type holo-CcmE. There are 6 Tyr residues in wild-type holo-CcmE, and all of them contribute to the three bands. In the Y134F variant, only the contribution from Tyr134 would be absent if other regions of spectra remained unchanged. In the observed spectrum of Y134F, the intensity of the small shoulder at 1603 cm–1 was decreased. This is more clearly seen in the difference spectrum, wild type minus Y134F, depicted by spectrum c. This suggests that tyrosinate coordinates to the heme in holo-CcmE but that it is lost in the Y134F variant. Heme Peripheral Modes in Wild-type Holo-CcmE—In the holo-protein, the presence of a covalent bond between a heme peripheral group and protein has been proposed (6Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We anticipated that the RR properties of the heme in holo-CcmE might provide evidence for the nature of this covalent modification. If covalent modification has not taken place, heme vinyl bending and stretching modes would be expected to appear in the low and high frequency regions, respectively (33Hu S.Z. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Fig. 9 (left panel) illustrates the low frequency RR spectra of reduced holo-CcmE (spectrum a) and of a noncovalent complex of CcmE and heme (spectrum b). The vinyl bending mode, δ(CβCaCb), appeared at 411 cm– for holo-CcmE. Although 2- and 4-vinyl modes are observed separately at 440 and 409 cm–1, respectively, for deoxy Mb and at similar frequencies for other heme proteins (33Hu S.Z. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar), only one vinyl mode was observed for holo-CcmE. Since the RR spectrum of the non-covalent complex of CcmE and heme also contains only one vinyl mode at 419 cm–1 as shown by spectrum b in Fig. 9, it is not clear which vinyl was modified. On the other hand, the vinyl C=C stretching mode, νCC, can be observed in the high frequency region. Fig. 9 (right panel) shows the high frequency region of RR spectra of reduced holo-CcmE (spectrum c) and the non-covalent CcmE-heme complex (spectrum d). The polarized bands of the latter at 1609 and 1621 cm–1 presumably arise from the νCC modes, and the 1621 cm–1 band is missing in the spectrum of holo-CcmE. These data suggest that one vinyl group is converted to a covalent linkage in holo-CcmE. Previous studies of CcmE have yielded some insight into the way in which heme is bound in this protein (6Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It was clear that the heme was in a high spin form in the ferric state (the form in which CcmE was purified when overexpressed in the E. coli periplasm) but had a 6cLS structure upon reduction. Two structures of apo-forms of the CcmE proteins from Shewanella putrefaciens and E. coli (7Enggist E. Thöny-Meyer L. Guntert P. Pervushin K.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13587-13594Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) did not show typical heme binding sites. However, it was possible to model a heme molecule on the surface of the E. coli protein (7Enggist E. Thöny-Meyer L. Guntert P. Pervushin K. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1551-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The residue known to bind heme covalently in CcmE, His130, was exposed to the solvent, and its environment did not provide obvious clues to the identity of the heme ligands. It has been suggested, however, that Tyr134 could be a heme ligand in CcmE (11Daltrop O. Stevens J.M. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9703-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Its position in the protein, which is 4 residues away from the heme-binding histidine, puts it in the same position (relative to the first Cys) as the His in c-type cytochromes in the CXXCH motif that is always an axial heme ligand; in addition, its mutation to Ala affected the heme binding ability of CcmE in vivo (34Enggist E. Schneider M.J. Schulz H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

In binding assays using soluble or cell-expressed human GPVI, we observed that (i) collagen, and the GPVI-specific ligands collagen-related peptides (CRP) and convulxin, competed with one another for the binding to GPVI and (ii) monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular part of the human receptor displayed selective inhibitory properties on GPVI interaction with its ligands. Monoclonal antibody 9E18 strongly reduced the binding of GPVI to collagen/CRP, 3F8 inhibited its interaction with convulxin, whereas 9O12 prevented all three interactions. These observations suggest that ligand-binding sites are distinct, exhibiting specific features but at the same time also sharing some common residues participating in the recognition of these ligands. The epitope of 9O12 was mapped by phage display, along with molecular modeling of human GPVI, which allowed the identification of residues within GPVI potentially involved in ligand recognition. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that valine 34 and leucine 36 are critical for GPVI interaction with collagen and CRP. The loop might thus be part of a collagen/CRP-binding site.

Platelet interaction with a damaged vessel wall initiates thrombus formation. Collagen is the main component of the subendothelial matrix allowing platelet adhesion and activation. Several collagen receptors are involved in this process (1Clemetson K.J. Clemetson J.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Among them, glycoprotein VI (GPVI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPVI, glycoprotein VI; rGPVI, recombinant human GPVI; rsGPVI, recombinant soluble human GPVI; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CRP, collagen-related peptides; KIR, killer cell inhibitory receptors; EC, extracellular; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; WT, wild type; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FcR, Fc receptor; LIR, leukocyte Ig-like receptors. plays a crucial role in platelet responses to collagen. GPVI belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors (2Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol.

The signaling pathway of GPVI is analogous to that of immune receptors; it involves a cascade of Tyr phosphorylation by Src family kinases and the association of the adaptor protein LAT with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. It eventually leads to phospholipase Cγ2 activation, increase in intracellular calcium concentration, and platelet activation (8Watson S.P. Asazuma N. Atkinson B. Berlanga O. Best D. Bobe R.

GPVI participates in stable platelet adhesion to subendothelial collagen and is responsible for collagen-induced platelet activation, leading to platelet aggregation and anionic phospholipid exposure, thus providing a procoagulant surface for thrombin formation (9Moroi M.

GPVI shares a high degree of homology with the low affinity IgA receptor FcαRI and killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) (2Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29019-29024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The genes encoding these receptors are located on the same chromosome (19q13.4) within the leukocyte receptor cluster (13Martin A.M. Kulski J.K. Witt C. Pontarotti P. Christiansen F.T. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 81-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The extracellular (EC) domain of GPVI contains two Ig-like loops of the C2 type. The EC1 N-terminal loop is of the IgC2-1 type, as is the EC1 domain of FcαRI, whereas the GPVI EC2 loop is of the IgC2-2 subtype found in KIRs (13Martin A.M. Kulski J.K. Witt C. Pontarotti P. Christiansen F.T. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 81-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The respective role of EC1, EC2, and the interdomain region varies from one receptor of the leukocyte receptor cluster family to another. The IgA-binding site has been shown to involve structures located in the EC1 domain of FcαRI (14Wines B.D. Sardjono C.T. Trist H.H. Lay C.S. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). KIR family members bind their ligand HLA in the hinge, interdomain region (15Fan Q.R. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Nat.

J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To locate ligand-binding site(s) on human GPVI, we have produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the extracellular part of human GPVI. Their ability to prevent GPVI interactions with collagen, CRP, and convulxin was measured in a binding assay using purified proteins and in a cell adhesion assay. The results indicate that the binding sites on GPVI for the diverse ligands seem to be distinct, exhibiting specific features but at the same time also sharing some common residues participating in the recognition of these ligands. Furthermore, we have previously characterized mAb 9O12 as a potent antagonist of GPVI function in vitro (17Lecut C. Feeney L.A. Kingsbury G. Hopkins J. Lanza F. Gachet C. Villeval J.L. Jandrot-Perrus M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Using phage display, we have identified its epitope within the GPVI structure. Site-directed mutagenesis has been performed on a soluble form of the receptor. The characterization of the GPVI mutants showed that a loop of the EC1 domain participates in the binding to collagen, with, in particular, Val-34 and, to a lesser extent, Leu-36 being critically involved in the interaction.

Residues Gly-30, Val-34, and Leu-36 of rsGPVI-Fc were altered to an alanine using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sense oligonucleotides of the mutagenic pairs were as follows: 5′-ACCTCCGGGCGCGGACCTGTACCGC-3′, V34A; 5′-CCGGGCGTGGACGCGTACCGCCTGGAG-3′, L36A; 5′-CCTCCGGTGCCAGGCACCTCCGGGCGCGGACGCGTACCGCCTGGA-3′, G30A-V34A-L36A. Mutant constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Wild type (WT) and mutant rsGPVI-Fc were produced as already reported (3Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T. Le Couedic J.P. Goodearl A. Dussault B. Fraser C. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by affinity chromatography on HiTrap protein A-Sepharose. Purity was checked by SDS-PAGE. To identify the epitope of 9O12, a linear pentadecamer phage display library was used, essentially as described elsewhere (19Vanhoorelbeke K. Depraetere H. Romijn R.A. Huizinga E.G. De Maeyer M. Deckmyn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37815-37821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Biotinylated 9O12 (10 μg) was incubated with phages in low ionic strength buffer, 0.5% Tween 20. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were added to the mixture. After five steps of washing in LIB, 0.5% Tween 20, bound phages were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2. Phages were amplified by infection of Escherichia coli K91 Kan cells and partially purified from the supernatant by polyethylene glycol precipitation. Two additional rounds of panning were performed, and after each round, phages were amplified. A dilution of the final eluted phage pool was plated on Luria broth agar plates containing tetracycline. Single colonies were picked from these plates and grown overnight in 2× TY medium containing tetracycline in a 96-well plate. After centrifugation of the plates, 9O12-binding phages contained in the supernatant were detected in ELISA. Phage DNA was prepared by phenol/chloroform extraction for sequencing. Proteins from phages were separated on a 10% acrylamide slab gel, under non-reducing and reducing conditions, and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After blocking with a 5% milk powder solution, the membrane was incubated with biotinylated 9O12 (2 μg/ml in PBS, 0.4% milk powder) for 2 h. The membrane was washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 80 before a 2-h incubation with streptavidin-HRP. The membrane was developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Phage Binding to 9O12—Purified 9O12 (10 μg/ml in PBS) was coated overnight in a 96-well plate. After blocking with a 2% milk powder solution, dilution series of the individual phage clones selected after the final panning round were added to the wells (all in PBS, 0.2% milk powder). An irrelevant phage that specifically binds to von Willebrand factor (20Ulrichts H. Depraetere H. Harsfalvi J. Deckmyn H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was used as a negative control. Phages were incubated at room temperature for 90 min. After washing with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, a polyclonal anti-M13-HRP-conjugated antibody was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. Bound phages were detected, after washing, by hydrolysis of ortho-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. Alternatively, phages were preincubated 30 min with increasing doses of rsGPVI-Fc before addition to the 9O12-containing wells. Binding of rsGPVI-Fc (WT and mutants) to Collagen, CRP or Convulxin—Experiments were conducted mainly as described (17Lecut C. Feeney L.A. Kingsbury G. Hopkins J. Lanza F. Gachet C. Villeval J.L. Jandrot-Perrus M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); microtitration wells were coated overnight with collagen type I, CRP, or convulxin, in PBS, and blocked with 0.2% BSA for 2 h. WT or mutant rsGPVI-Fc (in PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20) were added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. Alternatively, rsGPVI-Fc was preincubated for 30 min with 10 μg/ml anti-GPVI mAb before addition to the wells. After washing with PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, bound rsGPVI-Fc was detected using HRP-coupled protein A or HRP-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody, as indicated. To study the binding of convulxin to rsGPVI-Fc, microtitration wells were coated with a non-blocking anti-GPVI mAb (1P10, 5 μg/ml) and saturated with BSA. 0.5 nm rsGPVI-Fc (in PBS, 0.2% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20) was added for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, immobilized rsGPVI-Fc was incubated 45 min with anti-GPVI mAbs or buffer, and then 125I-convulxin was added, and incubation was prolonged for 10 min. Wells were washed with PBS, 0.2% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 and counted for 125I-convulxin in a γ-counter. Experiments were mainly performed as described previously (3Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T. Le Couedic J.P. Goodearl A. Dussault B. Fraser C. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L.

After blocking with BSA, rGPVI-HEL cells (5.106/ml) in Tyrode-Hepes buffer were added to the wells and allowed to adhere for 1 h under gentle agitation. For competition studies, cells were preincubated for 30 min with increasing doses of collagen, CRP, or convulxin before adhesion. Adherent cells were quantified by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity using para-nitrophenylphosphate disodium salt. Human washed platelets (3.108/ml) were prepared according to a previously described procedure (7Jandrot-Perrus M. Lagrue A.H. Okuma M. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27035-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of the extracellular domain of human GPVI was built by comparative modeling using the 2.1-Å x-ray structure of the first two Ig-like domains of human LIR-1 (Protein Data Bank code 1G0X (22Chapman T.L. Heikema A.P. West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)) as template. The sequences of the extracellular domain of human GPVI and the crystallized ligand-binding domain of LIR-1 were first aligned using the Clustal algorithm (23Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The quality of the final alignment was evaluated by identity (48%) and homology score (77%). The resulting alignment was used as input for Modeler v6.0 (salilab.org/modeler) (24Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). Several three-dimensional structures were generated (n = 20) and evaluated using the Modeler objective function. Root mean square deviation was inferior to 0.3 Å. Only the first model was used. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test or one-factor analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni test was used to evaluate statistical significance. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Competition between Collagen, CRP, and Convulxin for the Binding to Cell-expressed GPVI—The hematopoietic cell line HEL was engineered to overexpress recombinant human GPVI (rGPVI) (3Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T. Le Couedic J.P. Goodearl A. Dussault B. Fraser C. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). rGPVI associated with FcRγ. Equilibrium binding studies indicated that 125I-labeled convulxin bound to 65,000 sites with a Kd of 0.35 nm on GPVI-transduced cells versus 11,000 sites with a similar Kd on mock-transduced cells. Convulxin induced intracellular calcium mobilization in rGPVI-HEL (not shown). In addition, rGPVI-HEL cells were able to adhere to immobilized collagen, CRP, and convulxin in a time- and dose-dependent manner (17Lecut C. Feeney L.A. Kingsbury G. Hopkins J. Lanza F. Gachet C. Villeval J.L. Jandrot-Perrus M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). rGPVI-HEL expressed a low level of integrin α2β1 at their surface as indicated by flow cytometry using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-CD49b. We investigated the ability of collagen, CRP, and convulxin to compete with one another for the binding to cell-expressed GPVI by studying the adhesion of rGPVI-HEL to the coated ligand in the presence of the others in soluble form. Cell adhesion to collagen was reduced by increasing amounts of convulxin; maximal inhibition reached 88% with 0.5 nm convulxin, and the IC50 was 0.08 nm (Fig. 1A). CRP had a moderate inhibitory effect on the adhesion of rGPVI-HEL to collagen. 2.5 μg/ml CRP decreased adhesion by 40%, and 10-fold higher concentrations did not further inhibit the binding to collagen (not shown). Adhesion of rGPVI-HEL to convulxin was abolished by increasing amounts of collagen. The IC50 was 10 μg/ml, and 95% inhibition was reached with 50 μg/ml collagen (Fig. 1B). In contrast, 50 μg/ml CRP only reduced adhesion to convulxin by 20%, but 2.5 μg/ml was sufficient to reach the maximal inhibitory effect (not shown). Adhesion to CRP was fully inhibited by both collagen and convulxin. 95% inhibition was reached with 10 μg/ml collagen (IC50 = 2.5 μg/ml) (Fig. 1D), whereas the maximal effect was obtained with 0.25 nm convulxin (IC50 = 0.06 nm) (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that collagen and convulxin, and to a lesser extent CRP, compete with each other for the binding to cell-expressed rGPVI. Identification of Selective Antagonists of GPVI Interaction with Its Ligands—To further characterize ligand-binding sites on human GPVI, we have tested the ability of several mAbs directed against the extracellular domain of the receptor to inhibit the interaction of a recombinant soluble form of GPVI (rsGPVI-Fc) with its ligands collagen, CRP, and convulxin. One of them, 9O12, prevented the interaction of GPVI with both collagen and convulxin (17Lecut C. Feeney L.A. Kingsbury G. Hopkins J. Lanza F. Gachet C. Villeval J.L. Jandrot-Perrus M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The binding of rsGPVI-Fc to immobilized collagen was markedly inhibited by 9O12, with an IC50 of 1.5 μg/ml, and 20 μg/ml antibody yielded an inhibition of 85%. The binding of convulxin to immobilized rsGPVI-Fc was strongly reduced by the antibody; the maximal inhibition reached 80% for concentrations of 9O12 above 10 μg/ml, and the IC50 was 3 μg/ml. In addition, 10 μg/ml 9O12 abolished the binding of rsGPVI-Fc to CRP. The effect of other mAbs on the binding of rsGPVI-Fc to its ligands was compared with 9O12 using the same concentration of 10 μg/ml (Fig. 2). 9E18 reduced the binding of GPVI to collagen by 45%, reduced the binding of GPVI to CRP by 85%, but had little effect on binding to convulxin (25% inhibition). In addition, inhibition of GPVI interaction with collagen by 9E18 was dose-dependent; the maximal inhibition reached 55% for concentrations of 9E18 above 15 μg/ml, and the IC50 was 1.6 μg/ml (not shown). In contrast, 3F8 decreased the binding of rsGPVI-Fc to convulxin by 55% and to CRP by 50%, but not the binding to collagen (l0% inhibition, Fig. 2). 3F8 dose-dependently inhibited GPVI interaction with convulxin with an IC50 of 0.5 μg/ml. Maximal effect was reached with 5 μg/ml antibody and did not increase further with a higher concentration of 3F8 (not shown). In the presence of an isotype-matched control antibody, 7I20, the binding of rsGPVI to neither collagen, convulxin, nor CRP was affected (Fig. 2). Cross-reactivity studies showed that 9O12, 9E18, and 3F8 did not compete for the same binding site on rsGPVI-Fc; although each antibody prevented its own binding to GPVI, the interaction of the soluble receptor with one immobilized mAb was not impaired in the presence of the others (not shown). This indicated that the three mAbs recognize distinct epitopes on GPVI. Similar results were obtained when mAbs were tested on the adhesion of rGPVI-HEL to GPVI ligands (not shown). 9O12 (20 μg/ml) inhibited the adhesion of rGPVI-HEL to collagen by 70% and completely prevented cell adhesion to CRP (17Lecut C. Feeney L.A. Kingsbury G. Hopkins J. Lanza F. Gachet C. Villeval J.L. Jandrot-Perrus M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 20 μg/ml 9E18 reduced the adhesion of rGPVI-HEL to collagen by 35%. In contrast, the adhesion of rGPVI-HEL to convulxin was poorly affected by either 9O12 or 3F8, inhibition being only 25 and 10%, respectively. However, when cells were incubated with both 9O12 and 3F8, a synergistic inhibitory effect was observed that reached 65%. This might indicate that both monoclonal antibodies bind to independent sites close to or belonging to the convulxin-binding site. All three antibodies abolished the binding of rGPVI-HEL to immobilized CRP by more than 90% (not shown), consistent with the results obtained when using rsGPVI-Fc (Fig. 2B). Epitope Mapping of 9O12 Using Phage Display—Taken together, these results prompted us to focus our efforts on the identification of the epitope of mAb 9O12 since this antibody was the most efficient to prevent GPVI interactions with all its ligands, including the physiological collagen. For this purpose, we screened a combinatorial library of linear pentadecamer peptides by phage display technology. After three rounds of biopanning, 66 individual clones were obtained. 46 clones were randomly selected and tested for their ability to bind to immobilized 9O12 in ELISA. 12 were positive, as illustrated for three clones on Fig. 3A. The binding of 9O12 to the phages was also analyzed by Western blotting. 9O12 IgG recognized the phages under non-reducing conditions, whereas disulfide bridge reduction greatly impaired the binding of 9O12 (Fig. 3C). Importantly, rsGPVI-Fc competed with the selected phages for the binding to 9O12 in ELISA (illustrated on Fig. 3B with two clones), suggesting that the peptides displayed by the phages mimic a structure found in GPVI. No binding of the phages to other anti-GPVI mAbs (3F8, 3J24) was observed, demonstrating the specificity of their interaction with 9O12. Sequencing of these 12 clones resulted in the identification of four sequences (Table I). All sequences share the motif CGL XXVC. The presence of the two cysteines, together with the fact that the binding of 9O12 to the peptides was impaired upon disulfide bond reduction, strongly suggested that the cysteines were forming a disulfide bridge and that a constrained conformation was required for recognition by 9O12. This was consistent with our previous observation that the epitope of 9O12 within GPVI is conformational (17Lecut C. Feeney L.A. Kingsbury G. Hopkins J. Lanza F. Gachet C. Villeval J.L. Jandrot-Perrus M. J. Thromb.

Unfortunately, these were not soluble, and all our attempts to solubilize them remained unsuccessful, even after various modifications. We therefore chose a different approach and used computer modeling of GPVI to identify candidate residues for site-directed mutagenesis. Epitope Mapping of 9O12 Using Homology Modeling of GPVI Structure—The peptide sequences of the clones were aligned to the sequence of the extracellular domain of human GPVI. The motif CGL XXVC could not be found as such in the sequence of GPVI, and no obvious similarity was identified. However, we noticed a relative homology with region 30–40 of GPVI, and particularly, the presence of a glycine, a valine, and a leucine in the vicinity of a cysteine in position 28 (Table I). We used homology modeling to produce a structure of the EC domains of human GPVI. We observed that a loop located at an end of the IgC2-1 domain presented three residues found in the motif: Gly-30, Val-34, and Leu-36. These were in close vicinity, in a constrained environment, and apparently exposed at the surface of the protein, accessible to ligand (Fig. 4). Therefore, we hypothesized that these residues could be involved in collagen recognition. To test this hypothesis, we produced mutants of rsGPVI-Fc in which Gly-30, Val-34, and Leu-36 were altered to alanine. Three variants were constructed: two consisting of point mutations, V34A and L36A, and one in which the three residues were simultaneously mutated, G30A,V34A,L36A. Mutation of Val-34 and Leu-36 Inhibits the Binding of GPVI to Collagen and CRP—Mutants V34A, L36A, and G30A,V34A,L36A displayed an apparent molecular weight, determined in SDS-PAGE, identical to that of WT rsGPVI-Fc. They were recognized by a non-inhibitory anti-GPVI mAb (3J24) binding to WT rsGPVI-Fc in Western blot, indicating that proteins were correctly expressed. We measured the binding properties of 9O12 to immobilized rsGPVI-Fc mutants (2 μg/ml). None of the mutations affected the maximal binding of the antibody. The affinity of 9O12 for L36A was comparable with that measured for WT rsGPVI-Fc (Kd = 0.079 versus 0.075 μg/ml) (Table II). However, the affinity of 9O12 for V34A was significantly decreased by a factor of 1.6 (Kd = 0.125 μg/ml), as was the affinity of the antibody for the triple mutant (Kd = 0.127 μg/ml).Table IIAffinity of mAb 9O12 towards rsGPVI-Fc mutantsrsGPVI-FcKd ± S.E.Statistical significanceμg/mlWild type0.079 ± 0.006L36A0.075 ± 0.001NSV34A0.125 ± 0.002p < 0.001G30A,V34A,L36A0.127 ± 0.010p < 0.001 Open table in a new tab The ability of each mutant to bind to immobilized GPVI ligands was then investigated. WT rsGPVI-Fc dose-dependently bound to immobilized collagen with an apparent Kd of 1.2 ± 0.2 μg/ml (Fig. 5A). The L36A mutation slightly reduced the capacity of GPVI to bind to collagen; the Kd was of 3.6 ± 0.2 μg/ml. Mutation of Val-34 was far more effective and strongly impaired GPVI interaction with collagen. The apparent Kd increased to 22 ± 2 μg/ml. The triple mutation G30A, V34A,L36A yielded full inhibition of the binding to collagen. WT rsGPVI-Fc bound to immobilized CRP in a dose-dependent manner, with an apparent Kd of 0.8 ± 0.1 μg/ml comparable with that measured on collagen (Fig. 5B). Mutation of Leu-36 did not impair the ability of GPVI to interact with CRP; the resulting affinity was identical to that measured with WT rsGPVI-Fc (Kd = 1 ± 0.2 μg/ml). Mutation of Val-34, on the other hand, markedly reduced the affinity of GPVI toward CRP; the Kd increased to 6.5 ± 1 μg/ml. Again, simultaneous mutation of Gly-30, Val-34, and Leu-36 resulted in full inhibition of the binding to CRP. The Kd increased up to 70 ± 5 μg/ml. None of the mutations reduced the binding of rsGPVI-Fc to immobilized convulxin (data not shown). We further analyzed the effect of the mutations on GPVI function by testing the ability of the variants to compete with platelet GPVI and to inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 6). As already reported elsewhere (3Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T. Le Couedic J.P. Goodearl A. Dussault B. Fraser C. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), preincubation of WT rsGPVI-Fc with collagen completely prevented platelet aggregation. Mutant L36A similarly inhibited collagen-induced aggregation. In contrast, the V34A and the triple mutation almost completely reversed the inhibitory effect of rsGPVI-Fc on collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The fact that V34A and G30A,V34A,L36A could hardly prevent platelet activation by collagen correlated well with their respective loss of affinity toward collagen measured in ELISA. We describe here the characterization of ligand-binding sites in human GPVI using newly developed tools. GPVI is critically involved in collagen-induced platelet activation and thrombus formation following vascular injury (25Nieswandt B. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Although GPVI has been cloned (2Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29019-29024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 3Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T. Le Couedic J.P. Goodearl A. Dussault B. Fraser C. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the structure of its ligand-binding site. Whereas KIR family members bind their HLA ligands in the interdomain (EC1–EC2) region of the receptor, the IgA-binding site on FcαRI involves structures in the EC1 domain at a distance from the hinge region (14Wines B.D. Sardjono C.T. Trist H.H. Lay C.S. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Fan Q.R. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To characterize GPVI interactions with its ligands, we used two complementary approaches. First, we performed a static adhesion assay, using a hematopoietic cell line overexpressing human GPVI (rGPVI-HEL) to determine whether collagen, CRP, and convulxin could compete with one another for the binding to cell-expressed GPVI. Second, we have analyzed a panel of mAbs directed against the extracellular domain of human GPVI and measured their effect on the binding of a recombinant soluble form of human GPVI (rsGPVI-Fc) to its ligands. This led to the identification of three mAbs 9O12, 9E18, and 3F8 with selective inhibitory properties. Together the results obtained indicated that the diverse GPVI ligands interact with binding sites exhibiting specific features but also sharing some residues participating in the recognition of these ligands. This assertion is supported by several observations that follow. (i) Collagen and convulxin compete with each other and with CRP for the binding to GPVI. (ii) mAbs 9O12 and 9E18 both inhibit GPVI interaction with collagen but recognize independent epitopes on GPVI, and the same is observed for 9O12 and 3F8 on GPVI interaction with convulxin. (iii) Only the combination of 9O12 and 3F8 could strongly impair the binding of cell-expressed GPVI to convulxin. Collagen- and convulxin-binding sites thus exhibit distinct features but might also share common residues and be overlapping since 9O12 can prevent GPVI interactions with both ligands. The CRP-binding site is likely to be part of the collagen-binding site. Not only are these multimeric peptides built around the GPO motif derived from the sequence of collagen (18Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), but collagen and CRP compete with each other for the binding to GPVI. Schulte et al. (26Schulte V. Snell D. Bergmeier W. Zirngibl H. Watson S.P. Nieswandt B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 364-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) reported that the inhibitory effect of JAQ1, a mAb blocking the CRP-binding site on mouse GPVI, on collagen-induced platelet activation could be overcome by increasing concentrations of collagen. Our results are consistent with these data. However, since in addition convulxin fully prevents rGPVI-HEL adhesion to CRP, this site could be located in the vicinity of the convulxin-binding site or might share common structures with it. Despite the high affinity of the ligand, the interaction of GPVI with CRP is easily disrupted by the binding of anti-GPVI mAbs. This suggests that conformational changes within GPVI may be induced by interactions with antibodies or other ligands and may drastically reduce the accessibility of the CRP-binding site. 9O12 was of particular interest since it inhibits the interaction of GPVI with all its ligands and efficiently blocks all collagen- and CRP-induced platelet responses in vitro (17Lecut C. Feeney L.A. Kingsbury G. Hopkins J. Lanza F. Gachet C. Villeval J.L. Jandrot-Perrus M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We thus focused our efforts on the identification of its epitope. Preliminary experiments showed that 9O12 only bound to GPVI in non-reducing conditions, suggesting that its epitope involves a disulfide bridge-maintained structure. By screening a pentadecamer phage display peptide library, we have identified phages that specifically compete with rsGPVI-Fc for the binding to immobilized 9O12. Sequencing of those peptides revealed a consensus motif: CGLXXVC. The presence of two cysteines, together with the fact that 9O12 poorly recognized the peptides under reducing conditions, suggested that the cysteines formed a disulfide bridge and that such constrained structure is required for 9O12 binding. As expected, direct alignment of the peptides with the sequence of human GPVI did not lead to the identification of a linear epitope but allowed the localization of several amino acids found in the consensus motif that were in close vicinity in the GPVI sequence: Gly-30, Val-34, and Leu-36. Homology modeling of the structure of GPVI showed that these residues were exposed at the surface of the receptor and located in a loop within the EC1 domain. By site-directed mutagenesis, we generated variants of rsGPVI-Fc in which the selected residues were altered to alanine: V34A, L36A, and G30A,V34A,L36A. The characterization of the mutants showed that Val-34 and, to a lesser extent, Leu-36 are critically involved in GPVI interaction with collagen and CRP. By itself, the substitution V34A caused a major inhibition of the binding of GPVI to immobilized collagen and CRP. The triple mutation virtually abolished the binding to both ligands. Furthermore, V34A and G30A,V34A,L36A had a severely impaired ability to prevent collagen-induced platelet activation as compared with wild type rsGPVI-Fc. This loss of inhibitory effect nicely correlated with the decreased affinity of these variants for collagen. Mutation of Val-34 and the triple mutation similarly altered GPVI interaction with both collagen and CRP, confirming that the two ligands bind to common sites. In contrast, 9O12 still bound to the mutants, although its affinity for V34A and the triple mutant is significantly decreased. This suggests that residues other than Val-34 and Leu-36 are part of the 9O12 epitope. The scFv antibody 10B12, another antagonist of human GPVI function, is thought to map to the CRP-binding site (27Siljander P.R. Munnix I.C. Smethurst P.A. Deckmyn H. Lindhout T. Ouwehand W.H. Farndale R.W. Heemskerk J.W. Blood. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been shown, using molecular modeling of human GPVI and 10B12, along with site-directed mutagenesis, that lysine 59 in EC1 (Fig. 4, in brown) was critically involved in the binding to CRP, with a minor contribution of residues arginine 166 and arginine 117 located in the hinge region and EC2 domain of the receptor (28Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. Ijsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2003; Google Scholar). In this study, the authors suggested the existence of two CRP-binding sites of different affinity. Whether the motif in the EC1 domain we have identified is the secondary CRP-binding site is plausible. In conclusion, we have identified a site within GPVI critically involved in recognition of collagen and CRP. This locus comprises Val-34 and Leu-36 and is located in the first IgC2 domain, at a distance from the potential CRP-binding site described by Smethurst et al. (28Smethurst P.A. Joutsi-Korhonen L. O'Connor M.N. Wilson E. Jennings N.S. Garner S.F. Zhang Y. Knight C.G. Dafforn T.R. Buckle A. Ijsseldijk M.J. De Groot P.G. Watkins N.A. Farndale R.W. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2003; Google Scholar), in the hinge region of the receptor. The collagen-binding site thus appears to be widespread and to cover a larger surface on GPVI.

We show here that a novel gene (folate transporter 1 (FT1)) deleted in a Leishmania infantum methotrexate-resistant mutant corresponds to the main folate transporter (Km, 410 nm). FT1 was established as the main folate transporter by both gene transfection and by targeted gene deletion. Modulation of the expression of FT1 by these manipulations altered the susceptibility of Leishmania cells to methotrexate. Folate transport was stage-regulated with higher activity in the logarithmic phase and less in the stationary phase. FT1 fused to green fluorescent protein led to the observation that FT1 was located in the plasma membrane in the logarithmic phase but was retargeted to an intracellular organelle followed by a degradation of the protein in stationary phase.

Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania and can result in a variety of clinical symptoms with visceral infections that are usually fatal if left untreated (1Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Even today, pentavalent antimonial agents are the mainstay for the control of this disease. However, resistance to this class of drugs is now prevalent in several endemic areas (2Sundar S. More D.K. Singh M.K. Singh V.P. Sharma S. Makharia A. Kumar P.C. Murray H.W. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 31: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) demonstrating the urgent need for novel effective treatment alternatives. As a result of the effort to discover new drugs, miltefosine, an inhibitor of alkyl phospholipid metabolism, has recently been approved for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in India (3Sundar S. Jha T.K. Thakur C.P. Engel J. Sindermann H. Fischer C. Junge K. Bryceson A. Berman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 1739-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Unfortunately the ease with which miltefosine-resistant Leishmania mutants can be generated in vitro suggests a strong potential for the appearance of such mutants in the field (4Perez-Victoria F.J. Gamarro F. Ouellette M. Castanys S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49965-49971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); thus there is still a need for the development of effective new therapies against this parasite. The folate biosynthesis pathway has been exploited extensively for the development of a variety of drugs. Folates are made of a pterin moiety conjugated to para-aminobenzoic acid and glutamic acid. Reduced folates are key cofactors in the biosynthesis of thymidylate, and inhibitors of this pathway act primarily at the level of dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for supplying the cell with reduced folates (for reviews, see Refs. 5Schweitzer B.I. Dicker A.P. Bertino J.R. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2441-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar and 6Zhao R. Goldman I.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7431-7457Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Antifolates are widely used in chemotherapy but have not been successful yet against infections caused by Leishmania. Nevertheless many distinct features in the folate metabolism of this organism have been identified, some of which could prove to be useful therapeutic targets (7Nare B. Luba J. Hardy L.W. Beverley S. Parasitology. 1997; 114: S101-S110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ouellette M. Drummelsmith J. El-Fadili A. Kundig C. Richard D. Roy G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A number of lead antifolate molecules were indeed shown to be active against Leishmania (for a review, see Ref. 9Gilbert I.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1587: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our understanding of pterin and folate metabolism and transport in Leishmania is due in large part to studies of resistance mechanisms to the model antifolate drug methotrexate (MTX) 1The abbreviations used are: MTX, methotrexate; BT1, biopterin transporter 1; FT1, folate transporter 1; FT3, folate transporter 3; FT5, folate transporter 5; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; HA, hemagglutinin; Li, L. infantum; HYG, hygromycin phosphotransferase; NEO, neomycin phosphotransferase; DKO, double knockout; SKO, single knock-out; PGPD, p-glycoprotein D. 1The abbreviations used are: MTX, methotrexate; BT1, biopterin transporter 1; FT1, folate transporter 1; FT3, folate transporter 3; FT5, folate transporter 5; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; HA, hemagglutinin; Li, L. infantum; HYG, hygromycin phosphotransferase; NEO, neomycin phosphotransferase; DKO, double knockout; SKO, single knock-out; PGPD, p-glycoprotein D.

Roy G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Resistance to MTX in Leishmania can be conferred by several genes but is also usually correlated with a reduced accumulation of the drug (10Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13501-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kaur K. Coons T. Emmett K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7020-7028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reduced uptake of MTX is paralleled by a marked decrease in folate uptake, suggesting that the expression of a common folate/MTX transporter is strongly down-regulated in some MTX-resistant Leishmania. Since Leishmania is a folate auxotroph, mutants with markedly reduced folate uptake must compensate for this decrease so the parasite can meet its folate requirements. In Leishmania tarentolae, the mechanism of compensation involves the overexpression of the biopterin transporter 1 (BT1), which transports folates but not MTX to meet the folate requirements of the cell (13Kundig C. Haimeur A. Legare D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). BT1 is a biopterin transporter (13Kundig C. Haimeur A. Legare D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Lemley C. Yan S. Dole V.S. Madhubala R. Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Myler P.J. Stuart K.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that is part of a family of transmembrane proteins. Fourteen putative proteins belonging to this family are part of the Leishmania genome (www.genedb.org). This family has members in a variety of organisms, including the related parasite Trypanosoma brucei as well as the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the cyanobacteria Synechocystis and Synechococcus. A second member of this family in Leishmania, the folate transporter 5 (FT5), was recently investigated and shown to be a very high affinity and low capacity folate/MTX transporter (15Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29460-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, FT5 does not correspond to the main Leishmania folate transporter. Folate transport in Leishmania is known to be regulated with the growth stage of the parasite with high activity in the logarithmic stage of the parasite and residual activity in the stationary phase (16Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10053-10058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we present our functional studies of the folate transporter 1 (FT1), a transporter belonging to the BT1 family. Molecular and biochemical analyses indicated that it corresponds to the primary high affinity folate/MTX transporter of Leishmania cells. Modulation of the expression of FT1 changed antifolate susceptibility. The FT1 protein was located in the plasma membrane in the logarithmic growth phase of the parasite, but the protein was retargeted intracellularly when the parasite reached the stationary growth phase. Leishmania Growth—The Leishmania infantum and the L. tarentolae TarII wild-type cells and the mutant MTX1000.6 cell lines have been described previously (10Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Sereno D. Roy G. Lemesre J.L. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). L. infantum and L. tarentolae cells were grown in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10 and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 5 mg/ml hemin, respectively. Leishmania promastigotes were transfected by electroporation as reported previously (19Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In this work, we also transfected the FT1 gene in TarII MTX1000.6 and generated an L. infantum line with one FT1 allele disrupted (LiFT1SKO) and with two FT1 alleles disrupted (LiFT1DKO). In the latter cell line we also transfected an intact episomal copy of the FT1 gene. DNA Manipulations—Total DNA was isolated using DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen). Southern hybridization was performed following standard protocols (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.57Google Scholar). The L. tarentolae folate transporter 3 (FT3) probe (see Ref. 15Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29460-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the L. infantum FT1 probe were obtained by PCR. The primer sequences used were 5′-ATG-TCC-CAC-AAG-GAG-GCT-GC-3′ and 5′-CTA-CCA-TTC-ATC-CCT-CTT-GTG-C-3′ for FT3 and 5′-GCT-CTA-GAC-CAT-TGC-CAT-CAG-CAT-GTC-C-3′ and 5′-GCA-AGC-TTT-TTC-TGA-AGC-GCC-CGC-C-3′ for LiFT1 (see Fig. 4A, primers 1 and 2). The XbaI and HindIII restriction sites in primers 1 and 2 are underlined. Generation of Expression Vectors—The FT1 gene was obtained from a cosmid derived from a L. infantum genomic DNA library hybridized with a L. tarentolae FT3 probe. The LiFT1 gene construct was obtained by PCR with primers 1 and 2 (Fig. 4A), digested with XbaI and HindIII, and then cloned into the Leishmania expression vector pSP72αHYGα (21El Fadili A. Kundig C. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The pSPαBLEαFT1 construct was made by amplifying the bleomycin-binding protein gene, which confers resistance to the drug Zeocin (Invitrogen), using the pZErO™-1 vector (Invitrogen) as template. The resulting 450-bp BLE marker was cloned with two α-tubulin intergenic sequences and the FT1 gene to generate pSPαBLEαFT1. The pSPαHYGαFT1-GFP construct was obtained by PCR amplification of the FT1 gene using primer 1 and primer 7 (5′-GGA-ATT-CTT-CTT-CTG-AAG-CGC-CCG-CCC-3′, see Fig. 4A), digestion of the product by XbaI and EcoRI (underlined), and cloning in pBluescript. The enhanced GFP (EGFP) gene (22Legare D. Richard D. Mukhopadhyay R. Stierhof Y.D. Rosen B.P. Haimeur A. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26301-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-CGC-GAA-TTC-ATG-GTG-AGC-AAG-GGC-GAG-GAG-C-3′ and 5′-CCC-AAG-CTT-ACT-TGT-ACA-GCT-CGT-CCA-TGC-CG-3′, digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and cloned in-frame with FT1. This construct was finally cloned in pSPαHYGα. A control construct pGEM-7zfαNEOαPGPD-EGFP-HA was made by making an in-frame fusion of the ATP-binding cassette protein PGPD (23Legare D. Hettema E. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with EGFP. Briefly the stop codon of PGPD was deleted by replacing the last 1467 nucleotides of the gene by an equivalent PCR fragment lacking the stop codon. The GFP gene was amplified by PCR with one of the primers containing a tail corresponding to the nine amino acids of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA). The EGFP-HA PCR fragment was cloned inframe into the PGPD stopless construct. The PGPD-EGFP-HA cassette was cloned in the pGEM-7zfαNEOα expression vector (19Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Generation of an FT1 Null Mutant—To generate the FT1 inactivation cassettes, flanking regions of the gene were amplified by PCR. A 500-bp upstream fragment was obtained using primer 3 (see Fig. 4A) (5′-CCC-AAG-CTT-CGA-GTC-CAC-TTC-ATT-TTT-CCG-3′) and primer 4 (5′-GCT-CTA-GAT-GCT-GAT-GGC-AAT-GGA-GAC-C-3′). The resulting amplicon was digested with HindIII and XbaI (underlined) and cloned into pSPYHYG and pSPYNEO vectors (24Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For the downstream region, a 1.2-kb fragment was PCR-amplified using primers 5 (5′-GAA-GAT-CTT-CCG-TGA-CAC-TCT-ACG-TTC-C-3′) and 6 (5′-GAA-GAT-CTA-GGC-CAG-TCG-CAC-CAT-CAA-C-3′) (see Fig. 4A). The PCR product obtained was digested with BglII (underlined) and cloned into pSPYHYG and pSPYNEO vectors with the FT1 upstream region. The inactivation cassettes were amplified using primers 3 and 6, resulting in a 2.7-kb neomycin phosphotransferase (NEO) cassette and a 3-kb hygromycin phosphotransferase (HYG) cassette. The 2.7-kb NEO cassette was used to disrupt one FT1 allele by homologous recombination. The HYG cassette was then used to disrupt the second FT1 allele. Specific internal primers in the NEO (primer 8 (5′-CTG-CTT-GCC-GAA-TAT-CAT-GG-3′) and the HYG (primer 9 (5′-GTG-GTT-GGC-TTG-TAT-GGA-GC-3′) markers along with a primer outside the targeting construct (primer 10 (5′-TTT-GGC-CAC-TCC-TTC-ATG-AG-3′)) were designed to confirm the integration of the cassettes. DNA Sequence Analysis—DNA sequencing was done on an Applied Biosystems 377 automated sequencer. Analysis of the sequence was performed using the GCG software package (Genetics Computer Group) and Clone Manager 5™. The nucleotide sequence reported here has been deposited in the GenBank™ sequence data base under the accession number AY577522. Pteridine Transport Experiments—Transport experiments were performed as described previously (10Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Tritium-labeled [3H]folate (69 Ci/mmol) and [3H]MTX (28.6 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals. Transport studies were carried out using various concentrations of radioactive pteridines (10 nm to 1 μm) to determine the apparent affinity constant (Km). The quantity of accumulated radioactivity was normalized with Leishmania cell numbers. To measure folate and MTX transport, the uptake of cells incubated on ice was subtracted. Confocal Microscopy—Cells were immobilized with 2% paraformaldehyde and mounted on microscope slides with coverslips. Samples were viewed with an Olympus FV300 confocal scanning laser system installed on an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope with an argon laser. Visualization of the fluorophore was achieved using a 488 nm excitation filter and 510/530 nm emission filter. Samples were scanned for green fluorescence using a 60× objective (numerical aperture, 1.40) and 3× zoom. Images of 1024 × 1024 pixels were obtained using Olympus Fluoview 300 software and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Western Blots—Protein electrophoresis, protein transfer, and their reactions with polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Molecular Probes) were performed following standard procedures (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 377Google Scholar). Gene Deletion of Members of the BT1 Family in Methotrexate-resistant L. infantum—Leishmania cells selected for MTX resistance often exhibit a defect in the transport of MTX and folate (10Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol.

The proteins responsible for the transport of pterins and folates in Leishmania are starting to be known and correspond to a novel family of membrane proteins known as the BT1 family (pfam.wustl.edu/). BT1 is a high affinity (Km, 4.9 μm) biopterin transporter (13Kundig C. Haimeur A. Legare D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Lemley C. Yan S. Dole V.S. Madhubala R. Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Myler P.J. Stuart K.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The completed L. major genome (www.genedb.org) suggests the presence of 14 proteins putatively part of the BT1 family. Some of these genes can be deleted in cells with reduced folate/MTX transport (15Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29460-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26El Fadili A. Kundig C. Roy G. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18575-18582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To identify the primary folate/MTX transporter we generated L. infantum MTX-resistant mutants. One of these mutants, called LiMTX1000.1, had a profound defect in MTX accumulation (Fig. 1A) that was paralleled by a decrease in folic acid accumulation (Fig. 1A). To test whether deletion of members of the BT1 family correlated with a defect in MTX/folate accumulation, we hybridized the total DNA of Leishmania cells to a probe derived from the L. tarentolae FT3 gene. This probe is known to recognize several members of the BT1 gene family (15Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29460-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As expected, several hybridizing bands were observed within the MTX-susceptible strains; some of these bands might contain more than one homologue, but at least three of these bands were deleted or rearranged in LiMTX1000.1 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Consequent to gene rearrangements, a new hybridizing band of 3 kb was observed in the mutant. To test whether one of the deleted bands could correspond to the main folate transporter, we screened a L. infantum cosmid DNA library using the same probe derived from the FT3 gene. Several cosmids were obtained and further characterized. One of them contained a 2.3-kb NheI-NheI fragment that appeared to be deleted in the LiMTX1000.1 mutant (Fig. 1B). The nucleotide sequence of this fragment and further sequencing on the cosmid revealed an open reading frame of about 2.1 kb resulting in a predicted protein of 708 amino acids (Fig. 2). The predicted protein encoded by this open reading frame is 80 and 59% identical to the L. tarentolae FT3 and FT5, respectively, and 41% identical to the Leishmania mexicana BT1 (Fig. 2). Homologues of these proteins are found in the kinetoplastid parasites Leishmania spp., T. brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi; in the apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii, and Eimeria tenella; in A. thaliana; and in the cyanobacteria Synechocystis and Synechococcus. In the now completed Leishmania major genome project a total of 14 putative pteridine transporters have been found on chromosomes 4, 6, 10, and 19, and in Leishmania donovani a series of six putative pteridine transporter genes (FT1 to FT6) were similar to the gene sequenced. Sequence comparison and ClustalW analysis (data not shown) indicated that the open reading frame (GenBank™ accession number AY577522) is closely related to a cluster of L. donovani sequences with the highest identity with FT1 (99%) (GenBank™ accession number AF084469), and we thus retained the name FT1 for the isolated L. infantum gene. This family of putative pteridine transporters is predicted to contain 12 putative transmembrane domains but otherwise is not closely related to other families of transport proteins, including proteins known to transport folates in other organisms.Fig. 2Predicted amino acid sequence of the L. infantum (Linf) folate transporter FT1. The sequence of the transporter, available under GenBank™ accession number AY577522, was compared with the L. mexicana (Lmex) biopterin transporter BT1 (GenBank™ AF078929) and the L. tarentolae (Ltar) high affinity folate transporter FT5 (GenBank™ AY099960) and putative pteridine transporter FT3 (GenBank™ AY099959). Identical amino acids are in black, while conservative amino acid changes are shaded. FT1 is 80, 59, and 41% identical to FT3, FT5, and BT1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FT1 Is the Main L. infantum Folate Transporter—The L. infantum gene FT1 was cloned into an expression vector and transfected in the L. tarentolae MTX1000.6 mutant in which folate and MTX uptake are greatly impaired (10Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. J. Biol.

[3H]MTX and [3H]folic acid uptake measurements were done for this transfectant and compared with the mutant. While no measurable accumulation of either folate or MTX was seen in the mutant cells under the conditions tested, we observed an important increase in both folic acid and MTX transport in the LiFT1 transfectant (Fig. 3). The level of accumulation in the TarII MTX1000.6-FT1 transfectant compared with levels found in the L. infantum wild-type cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting that FT1 may be the major folate transporter. This possibility was further supported by determination of the apparent Km of this FT1 transporter for folate and methotrexate as calculated using a double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burke plot; the value was found to be comparable to the Km found in Leishmania wild-type cells (Table I).Table IAffinities of folate transport in L. infantumParasitesKmaAverage of three independent measurements with a range of substrate concentration from 10 to 1000 nmFolic acidMethotrexatenmLiWTbWild type354 ± 79203 ± 49LiFT1410 ± 122423 ± 220a Average of three independent measurements with a range of substrate concentration from 10 to 1000 nmb Wild type Open table in a new tab To further prove that FT1 is the main folate transporter of L. infantum we generated an FT1 null mutant by replacing the coding region of FT1 by HYG or NEO expression cassettes (Fig. 4A). The cassettes contained ∼500 bp of flanking upstream and 1.2 kb of flanking downstream intergenic sequences of the FT1 gene necessary for homologous recombination. The NEO cassette was first electroporated in L. infantum, and transfectants growing in the presence of G418 were analyzed by Southern blots. In wild-type cells, an FT1 probe recognized a 2.3-kb NheI-NheI fragment (Fig. 4B, lane 1). Since FT1 is part of a gene family, other hybridizing bands were also observed. Integration of the NEO cassette resulted in the loss of an NheI site (Fig. 4A). An NheI digest would lead to a new fragment of about 8 kb hybridizing to the probe (there is at least one other folate transporter homologue besides FT1 on this fragment). This is what we observed by analyzing one cloned transfectant (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Since Leishmania is a diploid organism, one remaining intact FT1 allele needs to be disrupted. The HYG targeting cassette was thus transfected into the FT1-NEO single knock-out strain. Transfectants growing in the presence of both G418 and hygromycin B were analyzed by Southern blot. The integration of the HYG cassette also led to the loss of a NheI site, thus generating an 8.3-kb NheI fragment when hybridized to the FT1 probe (Fig. 4B, lane 3). The integrations of the selectable markers were confirmed by hybridization with NEO and HYG probes. The NEO marker was present in both the FT1 single and double knock-out mutant cells (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3, respectively), while the HYG probe only hybridized, as expected, to the DNA isolated from the FT1DKO mutant (Fig. 4D, lane 3). The integration of the inactivation cassettes was further confirmed by PCR using specific NEO and HYG internal primers along with a primer downstream of the FT1 gene but outside the inactivation cassette (Fig. 4A, primer 10). As expected, no amplicons were seen in wild-type cells (Fig. 4E, lanes 1 and 2) or in a single knock-out NEO transfectant (Fig. 4E, lane 3) while using the HYG primer. In the double NEO and HYG transfectant, amplified fragments of the expected size were obtained (Fig. 4E, lanes 5 and 6), confirming that both inactivation cassettes integrated within the desired locus. The integration of both NEO and HYG markers in the FT1 gene would suggest that there are no more intact copies of the gene. However, a 2.3-kb NheI-NheI fragment of the size of an intact FT1 allele still hybridized to an FT1 probe in the FT1DKO mutant. The intensity of the hybridizing band was lower in the DKO mutant, suggesting that indeed FT1 was inactivated and that other homologous genes comigrated with FT1 as was previously seen in the FT5 null mutant (15Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29460-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The functional analysis of the mutant indeed suggested that we were dealing with an FT1 null mutant (see below). An important decrease in the transport of folic acid and MTX was observed in the FT1DKO mutant (Fig. 5, A and B). The FT1DKO mutant still retained ∼25% of transport activities for both substrates. This residual transport could be due to the presence of FT5 previously described in L. tarentolae (15Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29460-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or to other members of the BT1 family. To confirm that this reduction in folic acid and MTX transport was due to the inactivation of FT1, we transfected the FT1DKO mutant with pSPαBLEαFT1. Transport experiments with this transfectant showed a reversion in the level of transport of both substrates to wild-type levels (Fig. 5, A and B), confirming that the observed decrease in transport was indeed due to inactivation of FT1. FT1 and Its Role in Antifolate Resistance—The mutant TarII MTX1000.6 is highly resistant to MTX and is associated with a marked reduction in the uptake of the drug resulting from the deletion of several genes belonging to the BT1 family (15Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29460-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Introduction of LiFT1 in this mutant increased the transport of both folate and MTX (Fig. 3), and the FT1 transfectant was found to be much more sensitive to MTX than the mutant, even reverting to the sensitivity level of wild-type cells (Fig. 6A). Deletion of members of the BT1 family is correlated with MTX resistance (Ref. 15Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29460-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar and Fig. 1), thus an FT1 null mutant would be expected to become resistant to the drug. The FT1DKO mutant strain showed an EC50 more than 20 times higher than the susceptible parental cells, while the FT1SKO exhibited an intermediate increase in MTX resistance (Fig. 6B). Introduction of an episomal copy of FT1 in the FT1DKO mutant restored the sensitivity found in wild-type cells (Fig. 6B). FT1 Is a Membrane Protein Specifically Expressed in Logarithmic Phase Parasites—To determine the cellular localization of the FT1 protein, we generated an FT1 protein fused to GFP at its C-terminal end. The FT1-GFP fusion was functional since upon transfection in the mutant TarII MTX1000.6 it led to levels of folate transport similar to those of the unfused protein (Figs. 7B and 3). Confo"
https://openalex.org/W2152298001,"BRE, brain and reproductive organ-expressed protein, was found previously to bind the intracellular juxtamembrane domain of a ubiquitous death receptor, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1), and to down-regulate TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB. Here we show that BRE also binds to another death receptor, Fas, and upon overexpression conferred resistance to apoptosis induced by TNF-α, anti-Fas agonist antibody, cycloheximide, and a variety of stress-related stimuli. However, down-regulation of the endogenous BRE by small interfering RNA increased apoptosis to TNF-α, but nottoetoposide, indicating that the physiological antiapoptotic role of this protein is specific to death receptor-mediated apoptosis. We further demonstrate that BRE mediates antiapoptosis by inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery but without translocation to the mitochondria or nucleus or down-regulation of the cellular level of truncated Bid. Dissociation of BRE rapidly from TNF-R1, but not from Fas, upon receptor ligation suggests that this protein interacts with the death inducing signaling complex during apoptotic induction. Increased association of BREwith phosphorylated, sumoylated, and ubiquitinated proteins after death receptor stimulation was also detected. We conclude that in contrast to the truncated Bid that integrates mitochondrial apoptosis to death receptor-triggered apoptotic cascade, BRE inhibits the integration. We propose that BRE inhibits, by ubiquitination-like activity, components in or proximal to the death-inducing signaling complexes that are necessary for activation of the mitochondria.

Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Intrinsic apoptosis involves release of pro-apoptotic factors from the intermembrane compartment of mitochondria mediated by Bcl-2 family members following cellular stress, to trigger both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis (13Green D.R.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although cellular apoptosis can occur by either pathway independently, these pathways are linked by tBid, which recruits the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic activities to death receptor-mediated apoptosis (16Li H.

Death receptor-mediated apoptosis is regulated by intracellular proteins that include TRAFs, inhibitors of apoptosis, and c-FLIP, induction of some of which are NF-κB-dependent (22Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W.

By yeast two-hybrid screens, the anti-apoptotic proteins SODD and SUMO-1 that bind to the death domain (DD) of death receptors were identified (25Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.F. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The same approach also resulted in identification of BRE as a binding protein of TNF-R1 (27Gu C. Castellino A. Chan J.Y. Chao M.V. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). BRE is a highly conserved and widely expressed putative stress-modulating gene (28Li L. Yoo H. Becker F.F. Ali-Osman F. Chan J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Ching A.K. Li P.S. Li Q. Chan B.C. Chan J.Y. Lim P.L. Pang J.C. Chui Y.L.

DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, distinctly unlike SODD and SUMO-1, BRE binds to the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic region of the receptor. Whereas DDs are known to recruit adaptor molecules for signal transduction (31Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar), function of the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region has not been clearly elucidated, although it may be involved in NO synthase induction (32Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this protein by transfection was shown to down-modulate TNF-α-induced activation of the anti-apoptotic NF-κB (27Gu C. Castellino A. Chan J.Y. Chao M.V. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This indicated that BRE could promote apoptosis. Alternatively, BRE might function like SODD to block TNF-R1 signaling at the very proximal end, thus inhibiting both NF-κB and apoptotic pathways (26Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Here we sought to determine whether BRE has a pro- or anti-apoptotic role in the death receptor pathway, and by what mechanism apoptosis is regulated by this protein.

Establishment of Stable Transfectants—HeLa D122 cells were transfected with 3 μg of full-length BRE cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector or GS-BRE by Lipofectamine 2000. HeLa-stable transfectants of BRE or GS-BRE were selected for 2 weeks by 2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) or 400 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen), respectively, before being subjected to cloning by limiting dilution. D122 stable transfectants of BRE was likewise obtained, but the concentration of G418 used was 600 μg/ml. Jurkat A3 cells were transfected with 10 μg of BglII-linearized GS-BRE by electroporation using Bio-Rad gene pulsar (1.6 kV at 25 microfarads) and selected for 2 weeks by 50 μg/ml Zeocin before cloning. Annexin-V Apoptosis Assay—Cells were treated with various death stimuli for the indicated time. Apoptosis as indicated by phosphatidylserine exposure was detected using annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Pharmingen) or TACS™ annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), according to the manufacturer's manual. Flow analysis was conducted using BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest software. All time points were measured in triplicate, and results were expressed as mean ± S.E. of multiple (≥3) independent experiments. Preparation and Transfection of siRNA—Two BRE-specific siRNA, Si1 and Si3, corresponding to TCTGGCTGCACATCATTGA (nucleotides 124–142, nucleotide position number 1 being the start of the initiation codon), and CTGGACTGGTGAATTTTCA (nucleotides 491–509), respectively, were custom designed by and purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). A ready-made β-actin siRNA corresponding to TGAAGATCAAGATCATTGC was directly purchased from Qiagen. siRNA was transfected at 150 nm using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 48 h after the first transfection, a second and third round of transfection with the same siRNA were performed with an interval of 48 h. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA from cells was prepared by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), treated with DNase I (amplification grade) (Invitrogen), and reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)12–18 (Invitrogen) as primer. All PCRs were carried out in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.2 mm dNTP, 2 mm MgCl2 and 1× AmpliTaq Gold buffer. For amplification of the ectopically expressed BRE, 28–30 cycles at the annealing temperature of 52.4 °C using the forward primer, T7 (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG), and reverse primer 1179L18 (5′-CAT CTG GGG CTG TAC GGA), were performed. For the endogenous BRE, 26 cycles at an annealing temperature of 57.7 °C were performed with 1093U18 (5′-CCT CGA GAC CAG CCA ACT) and 1650L18 (5′-AGT GAA GGG CTC TAG GAT) as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. Clontech primers, forward (5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC) and reverse G3PDH3 (5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA) were used for 16 cycles at annealing temperature of 61.9 °C for amplifying GAPDH. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HeLa cells (1 × 106) at 48 h after transient transfection with 3 μ g of GS-BRE, GS-BRE (ΔHis6), or V5-BRE using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), or the same number of the HeLa stable GS-BRE transfectant, NHGS2, at various time points after treatment with TNF-α or anti-Fas agonist antibody (CH11) were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Crude protein concentration was measured by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Two hundred μg of total protein of each sample was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and immunoprecipitation was performed with 2 μg of the indicated antibodies and 50 μl of protein-G slurry for overnight incubation. Ten μl of the precipitated materials were subjected to Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Primary antibody was incubated with the membrane in the dilution recommended by the manufacturer. The bound primary antibody was visualized with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody using Lumingen™ PS-3 detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) with exposure to x-ray film (Kodak). λ-Phosphatase Treatment—2 × 106 HeLa cells at 48 h after transient transfection with GS-BRE were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 20 μl of 10× MnCl2 (20 mm). For each 155 μl of lysate, 5 μl of λ-protein phosphatase (2,000 units) was added with or without 1 mm sodium vanadate for incubation at 30 °C for 60 min. Reaction was stopped by cooling on ice, and the samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-pan-phosphoprotein antibody and Western blotting analysis as above. Subcellular Fractionation—For preparation of the nuclear fraction, 1 × 107 cells were required using the nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (BioVision, Inc., Mountain View, CA). For the preparation of cytosolic, microsomal, and mitochondrial fractions, 1 × 108 cells were required using digitonin lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 0.05% digitonin, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors mixture). Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min to pellet the mitochondria. The remaining supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to pellet the microsomes, leaving the supernatant as the cytosolic fraction. The mitochondrial and microsomal pellets were subsequently lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Reduction of TNF-α and Cycloheximide Apoptosis by BRE Overexpression—To determine the effect of BRE on TNF-α-induced apoptosis, three cell lines, D122 mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (33Eisenbach L. Segal S. Feldman M. Int. J. Cancer. 1983; 32: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), HeLa human cervical carcinoma, and Jurkat A3 human acute T cell leukemia subclone selected for high sensitivity to anti-Fas agonist antibody (34Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H.P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), were stably transfected with human BRE expression constructs and subjected to treatment with TNF-α in the presence of cycloheximide. Overexpression of BRE (Fig. 1, A and B) or GS-BRE, a C-terminally His6- and V5-tagged form of BRE (Fig. 1C), partially suppressed TNF-α-induced apoptosis in D122 and HeLa cell lines. The V5 epitope of GS-BRE allows protein expression to be detected in the transfectants using an anti-V5 monoclonal antibody. Although a rabbit polyclonal antibody with specificity to BRE was reported previously (35Miao J. Panesar N.S. Chan K.T. Lai F.M. Xia N. Wang Y. Johnson P.J. Chan J.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we were not able to confirm such specificity by using siRNA to guide identification of the BRE target band in immunoblotting. For the cycloheximide-sensitive Jurkat cells (36Gottlieb R.A. Nordberg J. Skowronski E. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 37Tang D. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Kid V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7245-7252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), stable transfection with GS-BRE, as shown by GSB1 and GSB2, reduced the apoptosis induced by a low dose of cycloheximide at 0.1 μg/ml (Fig. 1D) and also at a higher dose of 10 μg/ml (Fig. 1E), used in sensitizing HeLa to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Combining TNF-α with the low dose of cycloheximide increased apoptosis of the Jurkat cells, but the transfectant GSB2 remained more resistant to apoptosis than the parent and empty vector controls. GSB1, which expressed a lower level of GS-BRE, was no longer resistant (Fig. 1D). Promotion of TNF-α-induced Apoptosis by Down-regulation of BRE—To determine whether BRE at its endogenous expression level has any anti-apoptotic effect to TNF-α, endogenous BRE expression in HeLa was down-regulated by siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, two BRE siRNAs, Si1 and Si3, were found to suppress significantly both the GS-BRE protein expression in NHGS2 (the HeLa stable transfectant shown above in Fig. 1C with the highest expression level of GS-BRE), and the endogenous BRE transcript levels in NHGS2 and the parent HeLa. Si3 was more effective than Si1. As expected, the minor BRE transcripts, αb and αc (29Ching A.K. Li P.S. Li Q. Chan B.C. Chan J.Y. Lim P.L. Pang J.C. Chui Y.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), were also suppressed. As shown in Fig. 2C, down-regulation of BRE in HeLa and BRE and GS-BRE in NHGS2 by Si3 increased susceptibility of the cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis at 8 and 16 h of the cytokine treatment. Si1 and the β-actin siRNA (as negative control) had no effect compared with the mock transfection. Interestingly, the basal cell survival (without TNF-α treatment) was not affected by Si3 treatment. Thus, BRE has a physiological role in inhibiting TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Reduction of Apoptosis Induced by Fas and Stress-related Stimuli by Overexpression of BRE—Despite the failure of BRE to bind the intracellular region of Fas as reported (27Gu C. Castellino A. Chan J.Y. Chao M.V. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the effect of BRE overexpression in the Fas-sensitive Jurkat A3 cells in response to the anti-Fas agonist antibody, CH11, was tested. To our surprise, apoptotic response was attenuated in 4 of the 5 Jurkat A3 GS-BRE stable transfectants tested in approximate correlation with the GS-BRE expression levels. As with the apoptotic responses to cycloheximide and TNF-α, GSB2 was more resistant than GSB1, which in turn was more resistant than the untransfected and empty vector controls (Fig. 3A). The anti-apoptotic effect of BRE overexpression to the stress-related stimuli was also shown by GSB1 and -2 (Fig. 3B). To all three stimuli, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (DNA-damaging agent), etoposide (topoisomerase II inhibitor), and staurosporine (broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor), GSB2 was again more resistant than GSB1, the untransfected and empty vector control cells. Down-regulation of the endogenous BRE in HeLa by the siRNA, Si3, however, resulted in, at best, only a marginal increase of apoptosis to etoposide at 24 h of treatment (Fig. 3C). This indicates that BRE at its endogenous expression level has little, if any, modulatory effect on apoptosis induced by stress stimulation. This is in contrast with the clear down-modulatory effect of the endogenous BRE on TNF-α-induced apoptosis in HeLa shown above in Fig. 2. In summary, the findings above show that BRE, when overexpressed, can impart cross-resistance to apoptosis induced by TNF-α, cycloheximide, anti-Fas agonist antibody, and stress stimuli in a linked manner. However, the physiological anti-apoptotic role of BRE is likely restricted to the death receptors. Association of BRE with Fas—The ability of BRE in reducing apoptotic response to both TNF-α and Fas prompted us to reappraise the interaction between BRE and Fas. HeLa cells transiently transfected with GS-BRE were used in co-immunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether the endogenous TNF-R1 and Fas could be pulled down together by the anti-V5 monoclonal antibody that binds the V5 tag at the C terminus of GS-BRE. As extended from the previously reported work showing co-precipitation of the ectopically expressed recombinant TNF-R1 and BRE (27Gu C. Castellino A. Chan J.Y. Chao M.V. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), endogenous TNF-R1 was found co-immunoprecipitated with GS-BRE (Fig. 4A, lane 1). The same result was obtained by using HeLa transiently transfected with a BRE construct encoding a BRE protein tagged at the N terminus with the V5 epitope, V5-BRE (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Likewise, when anti-TNF-R1 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the endogenous TNF-R1 of the GS-BRE-transfected cells, GS-BRE was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4B, lane 2). As with the TNF-R1, endogenous Fas was also co-immunoprecipitated with the GS-BRE using anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 4C, lane 1). In reverse, GS-BRE was co-immunoprecipitated with the endogenous Fas by two different anti-Fas antibodies (Fig. 4, D, lanes 2 and 3, and B, lane 3). Thus, our data not only confirm binding of BRE with TNF-R1 but also demonstrate binding of BRE with Fas. Inhibition of the Mitochondrial Apoptotic Pathway by Overexpression of BRE—To identify the apoptotic event inhibited by BRE overexpression, HeLa and Jurkat cells with or without stable transfection of GS-BRE were treated with the death receptor stimuli, anti-Fas agonist antibody, or TNF-α, or a stress stimulus, etoposide. Effects on the defining events encompassing the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in the 8-h time course studies were determined. In the Fas-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat transfectant GSB2 (GS), cleavage of caspase-8 and Bid was similar to that of the parent Jurkat cells. However, the mitochondria-dependent events were attenuated to different degrees, with the reduction in the cleavage of caspase-9 being the most remarkable, and the cytosolic release of Smac/DIABLO and cytochrome c being the least, and intermediate, respectively. Cleavage of the main executioner caspase-3 and substrate, PARP, was also mildly attenuated (Fig. 5A). These findings localize the inhibitory action of BRE to a downstream position of tBid. For the treatment of GSB2 with etoposide, all of the apoptotic events including the cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-9, Bid, caspase-3, and PARP, as well as the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO were either blocked or markedly delayed compared with the parent Jurkat in the 8-h time course study (Fig. 5B). This broad inhibition of all the apoptotic events is consistent with the block of the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, with cleavage of caspase-8 and Bid being secondary to activation of the etoposide-induced mitochondrial events (38Sun X.M.

The same broad inhibition of all the apoptotic events in the HeLa stable transfectant NHGS2 (N2) treated with TNF-α was also observed (Fig. 5C). This pattern is expected from a block at the mitochondria, which are involved in both the early receptor-proximal caspase-8 activation and later amplification of the receptor-initiated apoptotic signal in the TNF-α-treated HeLa cells (18Deng Y.

Dissociation of BRE from TNF-R1, but Not Fas, upon Receptor Ligation—To understand how BRE, a death-receptor associated protein, could exert its anti-apoptotic effect at the distal mitochondrial events, association of BRE with TNF-R1 at different time points after treatment with TNF-α was investigated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using the HeLa stable transfectant NHGS2. Within 2 min after TNF-α treatment, co-immunoprecipitation of GS-BRE with TNF-R1 became virtually undetectable. Simultaneously, association of TRADD with TNF-R1 was observed. Unlike SODD which reassociates with the TNF-R1 at 10 min after the receptor activation (26Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), no re-association of GS-BRE with TNF-R1 was found throughout the 1-h time course. As no reduction of GS-BRE in the total cell lysate was found in the same period, degradation of the cellular GS-BRE is unlikely the cause (Fig. 6A). This finding thus indicates that BRE dissociates from TNF-R1 early in the receptor signaling. In contrast, treatment of the same transfectant with anti-Fas agonist antibody, CH11, in the same time course did not lead to dissociation of GS-BRE from the DISC (Fig. 6B). GSB2, a Jurkat GS-BRE transfectant used above for all the experiments involving Fas, was not selected for study in this experiment, as this CD95 type II cell type produces too little DISC for detection with"

Growth factors, particularly ligands for G protein-coupled receptors, usually induce only modest JNK activation, although they may trigger marked activation of the related extracellular signal-regulated kinase. In the present study, we demonstrated that homozygous disruption of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) dramatically sensitized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to JNK activation induced by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate, two prototype ligands for G protein-coupled receptors. To a lesser degree, a lack of GSK-3beta also potentiated JNK activation in response to epidermal growth factor. In contrast, the absence of GSK-3beta decreased UV light-induced JNK activation. The increased JNK activation induced by LPA in GSK-3beta null MEFs was insufficient to trigger apoptotic cell death or growth inhibition. Instead, the increased JNK activation observed in GSK-3beta-/- MEFs was associated with an increased proliferative response to LPA, which was reduced by the inhibition of JNK. Ectopic expression of GSK-3beta in GSK-3beta-negative MEFs restrained LPA-triggered JNK phosphorylation and induced a concomitant decrease in the mitogenic response to LPA compatible with GSK-3beta through the inhibition of JNK activation, thus limiting LPA-induced cell proliferation. Mutation analysis indicated that GSK-3beta kinase activity was required for GSK-3beta to optimally inhibit LPA-stimulated JNK activation. Thus GSK-3beta serves as a physiological switch to specifically repress JNK activation in response to LPA, sphingosine-1-phosphate, or the epidermal growth factor. These results reveal a novel role for GSK-3beta in signal transduction and cellular responses to growth factors."

Whereas detailed descriptions of the pathway and individual components are now available, we lack knowledge of how the pathway is regulated. Genes encoding enzymes of the DOXP pathway are dispersed throughout the individual genomes, with the exception of ispD and ispF, which are transcriptionally coupled or, in a few organisms, fused together coding for a bifunctional enzyme (18Rohdich F. Wungsintaweekul J. Fellermeier M. Sagner S. Herz S. Kis K. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Zenk M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11758-11763Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The fused gene is ispDF, and recent analysis has shown that the encoded product IspDF indeed has two catalytic functions (33Gabrielsen M. Rohdich F. Eisenreich W. Gräwert T. Hecht S. Bacher A. Hunter W.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the vast majority of cases, bifunctional enzymes associated with a metabolic pathway catalyze consecutive reactions in that pathway. IspDF is therefore highly unusual because it catalyzes nonconsecutive steps in the pathway on either side of the intervening kinase, IspE (Fig. 1). This suggests that there may be a physical coupling between IspDF and IspE, with implications for the organization and regulation of the DOXP pathway. The quaternary structure of the bifunctional enzyme is of interest because the monofunctional IspD is a dimer (20Richard S.B. Bowman M.E. Kwiatkowski W. Kang I. Chow C. Lillo A.M. Cane D.E. Noel J.P.

Hexagonal rods were obtained at 4 °C in 3 μl of hanging drops containing a 2:1 mixture of 10 mg ml-1 protein solution (100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CMP and CTP) with reservoir (35% (v/v) ethylene glycol). The crystals have space group P6322 with one monomer per asymmetric unit and a solvent content of ∼62% (structure I). Isomorphous crystals, subsequently shown to contain Zn2+ in the IspF active site (structure II), were obtained from a separate protein preparation using 2 μl of hanging drops containing a 1:1 mixture of 12 mg ml-1 protein solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CMP and CTP, and 1 mm Na2VO3) with reservoir (25% (v/v) ethylene glycol).

The analytical standards were carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), α-amylase (200 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). Blue dextran was used to measure the void volume (V0). The elution volume (Ve) of each standard was measured and corrected by the subtraction of half the sample volume. The retention coefficient (R) for each standard was calculated as R = Ve/Vo. A plot of log10 molecular mass of standards against R gave a straight line used to calculate molecular mass values (data not shown). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed with a Beckman XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge, An-50Ti rotor (28,000 rpm at 20 °C), using absorption optics at a wavelength of 280 nm. Three different sample concentrations (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg ml-1) in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, with the addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of EcIspD and IspE, were used in the study, and all data were analyzed with SEDFIT (50Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar). The IspDF samples were analyzed alone and then in combination with the IspE derived from the same organism. All combinations of the two and then three protein mixtures were analyzed for the E. coli enzymes. Subunit, Domain, and Quaternary Structure of CjIspDF— Two structures (I and II) have been determined at resolutions of 2.3 and 3.1 Å, respectively. The structure of CjIspDF presents one subunit of 371 amino acids (∼41.7 kDa) per asymmetric unit and comprises two distinct domains (Fig. 2a). The N-terminal domain (residues 1–209) corresponds to the cytidyltransferase IspD, and the C-terminal domain (residues 210–371) corresponds to the synthase IspF. The N-terminal CjIspD segment forms a Rossmann fold-like α/β domain, into which is inserted an extended “β-arm” (β8 and β9). The core of the domain consists of a seven-stranded twisted β sheet (β5, β4, β1, β6, β10, β7, and β11), where all but β10 are parallel. This domain shares 25% sequence identity with EcIspD (Fig. 2b), and an overlay of the two structures (Protein Data Bank code 1I52) gives a root mean square deviation of 1.75 Å for 191 Cα atoms. The C-terminal CjIspF domain of 163 residues displays an α/β fold constructed with a four-stranded β-sheet of β12, β18, β16, and β17, with β18 antiparallel to the others, on one side and a four-helix bundle of α8 to α12 on the other. This domain shares a sequence identity of ∼48% with EcIspF (Fig. 2b), and this pair is more similar than the CjIspD and EcIspD domains, reflected in a root mean square deviation of 0.83 Å for superposition of 149 Cα atoms of CjIspF and EcIspF (Protein Data Bank 1GX1). The major difference between these two IspF structures occurs in the loop between α9 and α10 (CjIspD numbering) on one side of the active site, where deviations of nearly 8 Å occur between several equivalent Cα pairs (data not shown).Fig. 2Structure of the IspDF subunit. a, the N and C termini are labeled, β-strands are shown as cyan arrows, and α-helices are shown as blue ribbons. CMP, in each active site, is depicted as a ball-and-stick model and colored yellow for C positions, blue for N atoms, and red for O atoms; the Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions in the active site of the C-terminal domain are shown as black and gray spheres, respectively.

Residues boxed in red are strictly conserved; those in black are similar. ▴ indicates residues that participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with substrate and or product, whereas ▵ marks residues involved in van der Waals interactions with active site ligands. ○ identifies residues that bind metal ions, and ☆ indicates the isoleucine-lysine difference in the IspF active sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Eight segments of polypeptide form the CjIspD-IspF domain-domain interface over an area of ∼850 Å2. These segments include the loop leading into θ1, the β-strands β2 and β3, and the helix α7 on the N-terminal domain, which interact with the link section between α7 and β12; the C-terminal sections of α8 and α10; and the C terminus itself. The interface is mainly hydrophobic in character and involves the residues Val21, Phe25, Leu26, Tyr59, Leu198, Leu203, Pro206, Ile296, Phe366, and Trp368. In addition, the aliphatic component of polar side chains Lys20, Lys22, and Glu295 is aligned to provide van der Waals interactions between them, and in similar fashion, the side chain of Arg27 interacts with the aromatic ring of Tyr365. Only three direct hydrogen bonding interactions link the domains, Lys22 N with Glu295 O, Trp368 NE with Arg27 O, and Arg27 NH1 with Ile296 O (data not shown). The CjIspF domain is placed near a crystallographic 3-fold axis parallel to c, and the CjIspD domain is beside a crystallographic 2-fold, and these symmetry elements generate a CjIspDF hexamer displaying point group D3 (Fig. 3). This quaternary assembly is consistent with the monofunctional enzymes from other species (i.e. IspD homodimer and IspF homotrimer). The hexamer, for which subunits are assigned labels A to F, has a total mass of about 250.2 kDa and longest dimensions of ∼100 × 130 Å in the equatorial and axial directions, respectively. Two trimers (subunits A, B, and C and then subunits D, E, and F) of IspF domains form the apices, and three dimers of IspD domains form the middle of the assembly (Fig. 3). The IspD dimers involve subunit pairs A with D, B with E, and C with F. A distance of about 35 Å separates the IspD active sites within a dimer, the closest distance between two IspD active sites on separate dimers is 56 Å, and the closest distance between the IspD active site and IspF active site on the same monomer is ∼38 Å. The closest distance between two IspF active sites is ∼30 Å. The major contribution to the CjIspD dimer interface is provided by the association of the β-arm of each subunit, with a lesser contribution from side chain interactions between residues on helix α7. The active site is formed at the dimer interface by six segments of polypeptide from one subunit and one segment from the partner subunit. The dimer interface covers an area of ∼1670 Å2, 9% of the subunit surface area, and involves 26 intersubunit hydrogen bonds. The surface area is reduced by about 200 Å2 in comparison with EcIspD mainly due to a smaller loop, reduced by 8 residues, between β8 and β9 in CjIspD (Fig. 2b). IspF forms a compact homotrimer shaped like an extended trigonal prism. The trimer is formed using a single type of subunit-subunit interface with 18 intersubunit hydrogen bonds, mainly involving side chain atoms. The surface area of a CjIspF monomer buried in the homotrimer is 2630 Å2, about 15% of the total surface area of CjIspDF and significantly larger than the value of 2120 Å2 observed in EcIspF (35Kemp L.E. Bond C.S. Hunter W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6591-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). At the core of the trimer, on the 3-fold axis, is a narrow cavity into which is modeled GPP. This assignment was based on the electron density and previous characterization of ligands that bind EcIspF at the central regi"
https://openalex.org/W2141827022,"Reduced tissue oxygen tension (hypoxia) is appreciated as an efficient stimulus for neovascularization. The effect of hypoxia on the very first stages of vascular development is, however, less well characterized. Here we show that hypoxic conditions (1% O2) potently stimulated formation of an extensive vascular network during a discrete stage of mouse embryonal stem cell differentiation. The morphological changes correlated with an expanding pool of endothelial cells and with activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor-d (Vegf-d) and Vegf receptor-3 genes. VEGF receptor-3 expression was confined to vascular endothelial cells and analysis of the lymphatic marker Prox-1 revealed no expansion of lymphatic endothelial cells. Administration of neutralizing antibodies against either VEGF receptor-3 or VEGF receptor-2 impaired vascular network formation, whereas neutralizing antibodies against VEGF receptor-1 potentiated development of immature vascular structures. In addition, sequestering of VEGF receptor-3 ligands reduced vascularization in a manner similar to neutralization of VEGF receptor-3. We conclude that hypoxia-driven vascular development requires the activity of VEGF receptor-3."

Minicollagens and the glycoprotein NOWA are major components of the nematocyst capsule wall, which resists osmotic pressure of 15 MPa. Here we present the recombinant expression of NOWA, which spontaneously assembles to globular macromolecular particles that are sensitive to reduction as the native wall structure. Ultra-structural analysis showed that the Hydra nematocyst wall is composed of several layers of globular particles, which are interconnected via radiating rodlike protrusions. Evidence is presented that native wall particles contain NOWA and minicollagen, supposed to be linked via disulfide bonds between their homologous cysteine-rich domains. Our data suggest a continuous suprastructure of the nematocyst wall, assembled from wall proteins that share a common oligomerization motif."

Tax activates transcription from the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HTLV-I through association with cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). Here, we present evidence that transducer of regulated cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein 3 (TORC3), a co-activator of CREB, is involved in Tax-induced transcriptional activation from the HTLV-I LTR. By using a luciferase assay system, we show that TORC3 alone can enhance transcription from the HTLV-I LTR, as well as from a cellular cyclic AMP-response element (CRE). Interestingly, we find that co-expression of TORC3 and Tax dramatically increased transcriptional activation at the HTLV-I LTR. We also show by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments that TORC3 interacts with Tax. Using deletion mutant analysis, we identify the Tax interaction domain of TORC3 as a region spanning from amino acid 1 to 103, which contains a coiled-coil domain.

Tax is a pleiotropic factor that interacts with many cellular proteins to regulate gene expression. For example, Tax regulates the NF-κB pathway using a variety of mechanisms. Tax is not only able to activate NF-κB signaling by binding to NF-κB, IκB, and IKKδ (9Jeang K.T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Jin D.Y.

Furthermore, Tax also directly binds to p16ink4a, a member of the INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and suppress its function (16Haller K. Wu Y. Derow E. Schmitt I. Jeang K.T.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2055-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which leads to aberrant cell cycle progression.In addition to regulating expression of host cell genes, Tax also regulates transcription of viral genes by interacting directly with the cellular transcriptional factor CREB to activate the HTLV-I-LTR (19Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.W. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5156-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The Tax/CREB complex binds to the Tax-responsive element (TxRE) in the HTLV-I LTR, promoting viral transcription through the recruitment of co-activators such as CBP/p300 and p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor, a process that does not require phosphorylation of CREB (20Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 21Jiang H. Lu H.

Giam C.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5052-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The HTLV-I LTR is composed of three tandem repeats of TxRE, which contains a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) flanked by GC-rich sequences. Although the Tax/CREB complex appears to be recruited predominantly to the TxRE, it is not recruited to the cellular CRE as to a functional complex, suggesting that the CRE-flanking sequence provides specificity for binding of various activation complexes (23Tie F. Adya N. Greene W.C. Giam C.Z. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8368-8374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, protease sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the conformation of CREB differs according to the specific context of the CRE to which it is bound, indicating that the conformation of CREB is regulated by CRE-flanking sequences (24Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Virology. 2000; 270: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Specifically, the weak association of CREB with the CRE sequence of TxRE appears to expose its Tax-binding domain, allowing easy access of Tax to CREB. Binding of Tax may then tighten the ternary complex composed of CREB, Tax, and TxRE. Analysis of this ternary complex suggested that the GC-rich sequence flanking the CRE element in TxRE is crucial for interaction with Tax since this sequence was protected by Tax in a manner that depended on the dose of CREB (25Lundblad J.R.

Moreover, a drug that binds the minor groove of DNA was able to disrupt Tax binding to the CRE-flanking sequence, suggesting that the interaction of Tax with nucleotides in the minor groove of the flanking GC-rich sequence plays an important role in establishing the stable ternary complex. Interaction of protein factors with the flanking sequences in TxRE in HTLV-I-LTR in vivo has been also demonstrated by DNA protection assays (26Datta S. Kothari N.H. Fan H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8277-8285Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).However, these results do not fully explain the mechanism of Tax-dependent transcription of HTLV-I LTR. First of all, the physiological relevance of the ternary complex reconstituted by in vitro synthesized CREB and Tax may be questioned since no evidence has been presented that this complex has any biological function. Furthermore, protein complexes interacting with the flanking sequence in vivo may contain additional factors besides CREB and Tax. For example, we previously identified a cellular protein, TAXREB803/SRL300, which interacts with the 3′-flanking region of TxRE (27Youn H.G. Matsumoto J. Tanaka Y. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10015-10027Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This protein enhances Tax-dependent transcription and CREB binding to TxRE in cooperation with Tax. Thus, the precise mechanism of how Tax activation of CREB leads to transcriptional activation of the LTR remains to be elucidated.Recently, TORCs were identified as a family of CREB coactivators that bind to CREB and enhance CRE-mediated transcription in a phosphorylation-independent manner (28Conkright M.D. Canettieri G.

This transcriptional activation is facilitated by recruitment of the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 130 (TAF130) component of transcription factors IID (TFIID) to CREB. One member of the family, TORC3, is expressed at high levels in B and T lymphocytes (29Iourgenko V. Zhang W. Mickanin C. Daly I. Jiang C. Hexham J.M. Orth A.P. Miraglia L. Meltzer J. Garza D. Chirn G.W. McWhinnie E. Cohen D. Skelton J. Terry R. Yu Y. Bodian D. Buxton F.P. Zhu J. Song C. Labow M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, we examine the effect of TORC3 on Tax-mediated transcription regulated by the HTLV-I LTR. We find that TORC3 dramatically enhances Tax-mediated viral promoter activity. Furthermore, we show that TORC3 interacts with Tax directly via the N-terminal region of TORC3, which contains a coiled-coil domain.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Construction—cDNA encoding human TORC3 (accession number NM_022769) was obtained by RT-PCR from HEK-293T cells. The expression plasmid for TORC3 was constructed by inserting the full-length cDNA into EcoRI and XhoI sites of the epitope-tagged form of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The primers used for the PCR were 5′-aaagaattcATGGCCGCCTCGCCGGGCTCG-3′ and 5′-aaactcgagTCACAGTCTGTCAGCTCGAAA-3′. Lowercase letters indicate a linker sequence containing EcoRI and XhoI sites, respectively. A reporter plasmid, pTxRE-luc, which drives luciferase expression under a promoter with five copies of the Tax-responsive element, TxRE, was used. To construct plasmids expressing GST fusion TORC3 and its deletion mutants, pGST-TORC3, pGST-TORC3 (1–103 aa), pGST-TORC3 (95–620 aa), pGST-TORC3 (1–298 aa), and pGST-TORC3 (298–620 aa), the corresponding DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using their respective primers. The fragments were then subcloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites in pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The sequences of the primers used are the following: for GST-TORC3, 5′-aaagaattcATGGCCGCCTCGCCGGGCTCG-3′ and 5′-aaactcgagTCACAGTCTGTCAGCTCGAAA-3′; for GST-TORC3 (1–103 aa), 5′-aaagaattcATGGCCGCCTCGCCGGGCTCG-3′ and 5′-tttctcgagGAAGCGGTTCCTGGATGGCCT-3′; for GST-TORC3 (95–620 aa), 5′-aaagaattcGTGGAGAGGCCATCCAGGAAC-3′ and 5′-aaactcgagTCACAGTCTGTCAGCTCGAAA-3′; for GST-TORC3 (1–298 aa), 5′-aaagaattcATGGCCGCCTCGCCGGGCTCG-3′ and 5′-tttctcgagTGCCAAAGTGGTGGTCGGTGG-3′; and for GST-TORC3 (298–620 aa), 5′-aaagaattcGGCAGTATGAGTGTGGGGAAT-3′ and 5′-aaactcgagTCACAGTCTGTCAGCTCGAAA-3′. The expression plasmid for GAL4 fusion Tax was constructed by inserting full-length Tax into BamHI and SalI sites in pGAL4-luc. Full-length Tax was amplified by PCR using 5′-aaaggatccATGGCCCATTTCCCAGGGT-3′ and 5′-aaactcgagTCAGACTTCTGTTTCTCGGAA-3′ as primers and pcDNA3-Tax (30Ariumi Y. Kaida A. Lin J.Y. Hirota M. Masui O.

Lowercase letters indicate a linker sequence containing EcoRI and XhoI sites, respectively.Cell Culture—HEK-293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified chamber.Plasmid Transfection—HEK-293T cells were grown to 50% confluence in 60-mm dishes or 24-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with expression vectors or corresponding empty vector constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Antibodies—Rat anti-HA (3F10; Roche Applied Science) and mouse anti-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were purchased commercially. A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for Tax was raised against the bacterially expressed GST-Tax (233–353 aa) fusion protein. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat antibodies to rat IgG were from Jackson ImmunoReseach Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences.GST Pull-down Assay—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated by an affinity column with glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins bound to the resin were then incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled Tax, which was synthesized by in vitro translation using the TnT-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). The binding reactions were carried out in 600 ml of GST binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, supplemented with a Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of GST binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by adding 20 ml of sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by autoradiography.Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed using HEK-293T cells. The cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, supplemented with a Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min. The lysates were first cleared with protein G beads for 15 min and then incubated with 2 μg of anti-Tax for 2 h at 4 °C and incubated for another 1 h following the addition of 20 ml of protein G bead slurry. The beads were then washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot.Luciferase Reporter Assay—Luciferase assays were performed with the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activities in cell lysates were normalized relative to the Renilla luciferase activity derived from co-transfected pRL-RSV-luc (31Ohshima T. Koga H. Shimotohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29551-29557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). All reporter assays were performed in triplicate, and standard errors (S.E.) were denoted by the bars in the figures.RNA Interference—A duplex of 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to mRNA for TORC3, including two nucleotides of deoxythymidine at the 3′ end, was synthesized (Qiagen) and annealed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sense sequence of the duplex was 5′-CACCAUCCUGCCAGAAGACdTdT, and the antisense sequence was 3′-GUCUUCUGGCAGGAUGGUGdTdT. HEK-293T cells were transfected with 25 μl of 20 μm duplex RNA per 6-cm dish with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with the normal culture medium. For the RNA analysis, total RNA was isolated from cells 24 h after siRNA transfection and used as a template for RT-PCR. Primers used were 5′-AAAGAATTCGCCTTCGAGCAGCTCATGACC-3′ for the forward orientation and 5′-TTTCTCGAGGAAGCGGTTCCTGGATGGCCT-3′ for the reverse orientation.RNA Isolation, RT-PCR, and Reporter Assay—Total RNA was extracted by ISOGEN (Nippon Gene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To obtain TORC3 cDNA from the isolated RNA, reverse transcription was carried out using oligo(dT)12–18 as a primer in a reaction volume of 20 μl, in which 1 μg of total RNA was present. The cDNA was subjected to PCR with Taq polymerase (Promega) using 5′-AAAGAATTCGCCTTCGAGCAGCTCATGACC-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-TTTCTCGAGGAAGCGGTTCCTGGATGGCCT-3′ as a reverse primer. PCR was run for 25 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 30 s), annealing (52 °C for 30 s), and extension (72 °C for 1 min). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was used as an internal control for the RT-PCR. The primers used to amplify GAPDH mRNA were 5′-ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGG-3′ and 5′-TGGAGGGATCTCGCTCCTGG-3′. PCR for GAPDH was conducted for 20 cycles.For the reporter assay, at 24 h after the transfection with siRNA, the reporter plasmids were transfected together with pcDNA3-Tax by using FuGENE 6. At 24 h after the transfection of the reporter plasmids, expression of firefly luciferase from pGL3-LTR-luc and Renilla luciferase from pRL-RSV-luc was evaluated with the dual luciferase reporter assay system.RESULTSTORC3 Activates Transcription at the HTLV-I LTR as Well as Cellular CRE-containing Promoters—Since TORC3 is a co-activator of the transcription factor CREB that enhances CRE-mediated transcription of target genes, we explored the effect of TORC3 on Tax-dependent transcription from the CRE-containing HTLV-I LTR (Fig. 1A). We first performed a luciferase assay using a pLTR-luc reporter plasmid. We found that luciferase activity was enhanced by expression of either Tax or TORC3 (Fig. 1B) and was further enhanced by co-expression of Tax and TORC3. To determine whether TORC3 can activate CREB-dependent transcription of genes whose promoters contain a cellular CRE sequence, we transfected TORC3 into HEK-293T cells carrying the luciferase reporter plasmid, pCRE-luc, which has four repeats of the CRE consensus sequence (Fig. 1C). TORC3 alone activates pCRE-luc ∼200-fold above untransfected control cells, whereas Tax was unable to activate transcription from pCRE-luc (Fig. 1D). However, co-expression of Tax and TORC3 in HEK-293T cells greatly enhanced the expression of luciferase from pCRE-luc (Fig. 1D), suggesting a synergistic interaction between these two factors that may promote high levels of transcription in a cellular context.Since Tax potentiates the binding of CREB to the TxRE in the HTLV-I 5′-LTR to initiate viral gene expression, we next performed a reporter assay using pTxRE-luc. This reporter plasmid has in its promoter region five copies of the Tax-responsive element, which contains a core CRE element flanked by GC-rich sequences (Fig. 1C). In HEK293T cells transiently expressing TORC3 alone, transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR reached levels ∼700-fold above background (Fig. 1B). Intriguingly, co-expression of Tax and TORC3 dramatically enhanced pTxRE-luc expression to over 5,000-fold above background (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that although TORC3 alone can enhance transcription from the HTLV-I LTR via the TxRE, Tax is able to synergize with TORC3 to further increase transcription levels.Determination of the Region of TORC3 Important for Enhancement of Tax-mediated Transcription—To identify the region required for Tax-mediated transcription, we generated several deletion mutants of TORC3 (Fig. 2A) and examined the effect of these mutant proteins on Tax-mediated transcription. When HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with TORC3 (1–298 aa) and Tax, the level of the reporter activity remained at two-thirds of that of cells expressing Tax and full-length TORC3 (Fig. 2B). However, when TORC3 (298–620 aa) or TORC3 (95–620 aa), which lack the N-terminal region of TORC3, were co-transfected with Tax, the reporter activity was at levels comparable with those observed in cells expressing Tax alone (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the N-terminal region of TORC3 is involved in Tax-mediated transactivation via the TxRE element. In fact, TORC3 (1–103 aa), which contains only the N-terminal region, showed significant activity.Fig. 2TORC3 interacts with Tax through its N-terminal region, which contains a coiled-coil domain. A, a schematic representation of TORC3 and its deletion mutants. The N-terminal black bar shows the coiled-coil domain. B, the effects of TORC3 and deletion mutants on Tax-mediated LTR transactivation. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with 10 ng of pLTR-luc and an empty plasmid (–) or plasmids expressing TORC3 (full-length), TORC3 (1–298 aa), TORC3 (298–620 aa), TORC3 (1–103 aa), or TORC3 (95–620 aa) together with (open bar) or without (solid bar) a plasmid expressing Tax. At 24 h after transfection, luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured. Relative luciferase activity in cell lysates with and without Tax expression was normalized to that of the cell lysate without Tax and TORC3 expression. Expression levels of HA-TORC3 and its mutants were examined by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. Average values of three independent experiments are shown, and standard error (S.E.) is denoted by the error bars. C, in vitro-translated full-length [35S]methionine-labeled Tax was incubated with GST and GST-TORC3 derivatives, which were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The pull-down complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Input corresponds to 10% of the total amount of the reaction mixture. D, HEK-293T cells were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3-Myc-TORC3 together with (lane 2) or without (lane 1) 2 μg of pcDNA3-Tax. At 36 h after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) by an anti-Tax antibody, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with an anti-Myc antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TORC3 Interacts with Tax to Promote the Transactivation via the CRE Sequence—The N-terminal region of TORC3 contains a coiled-coil domain (∼70 aa), a motif that has often been implicated in protein-protein interactions. Since TORC3 is a CREB-interacting protein, we hypothesized that TORC3 enhancement of transcription is mediated through its association with Tax. To test this possibility, we performed a GST pull-down assay using bacterially generated GST-TORC3 fusion proteins and in vitro-translated Tax protein. As shown in Fig. 2C, GST-TORC3, but not GST alone, was able to associate with [35S]methionine-labeled Tax (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3). We found that Tax was able to bind to the region of TORC3 containing the coiled-coil domain (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 6) but was not able to interact with GST-TORC3 (95–620 aa) or GST-TORC3 (298–620 aa), both of which lacked the coiled-coil domain (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 7).Next, to analyze the interaction of TORC3 with Tax in cells, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding Tax and Myc-tagged TORC3. The immunocomplex precipitated with the anti-Tax antibody was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using the anti-Myc antibody. A 78-kDa band corresponding to the expected size of TORC3 was detected (Fig. 2D, lane 2), suggesting that TORC3 does in fact interact with Tax in cells. This result, together with the data shown above, suggests that the interaction of TORC3 with Tax is required to enhance transcription synergistically via CRE promoter sequences.TORC3 Functions as a Co-activator for Tax-mediated Transcriptional Activation—To examine whether TORC3 has effects on Tax-dependent transcription activity, we constructed an expression plasmid encoding a GAL4 DNA-binding domain-Tax fusion protein, GAL4-Tax, as well as a luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3-luc, which contains five GAL4-binding sites and an SV40 minimal promoter. These plasmids were introduced into HEK-293T cells together with plasmids expressing full-length TORC3 or TORC3 deletion mutants (Fig. 3). Expression of GAL4-Tax alone is able to activate pGL3-luc. However, co-expression of GAL4-Tax and full-length TORC3 induced a 3-fold increase in pGL3-luc activation as compared with GAL4-Tax alone. Co-expression of GAL4-Tax and TORC3 (1–298 aa) also resulted in enhanced luciferase activity, whereas we observed no synergy in cells co-expressing GAL4-Tax and TORC3 (298–620 aa). These results indicate that the interaction between Tax and TORC3 allows TORC3 to function as a co-activator for Tax.Fig. 3Tax-dependent transcription is enhanced by TORC3. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with 25 ng of GAL4-luciferase reporter plasmid, and 10 ng of the plasmids expressing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (indicated by GAL4) or the GAL4 DNA-binding domain-Tax fusion protein (indicated by GAL4-Tax) was co-transfected with 100 ng of the plasmid expressing the full-length TORC3, TORC3 (1–298 aa), TORC3 (298–620 aa), or an empty plasmid. At 24 h after transfection, luciferase activity was measured. Relative luciferase activities normalized to those of the cell lysate from cells transfected with pGAL4-luc, an empty plasmid, and pGAL4 are shown. Average values of three independent experiments are shown, and standard error (S.E.) is denoted by the error bars. Cells transfected with an empty plasmid, pcDNA3, are indicated by a minus sign.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Gene Silencing of TORC3 by siRNA Reduces Tax-mediated Transcriptional Activation—To examine the function of TORC3 under physiological conditions, we employed siRNA technology, using a synthetic oligonucleotide that forms a duplex RNA encoding nucleotides 1638–1646 of TORC3. Treatment with TORC3 siRNA efficiently reduced the level of TORC3 mRNA in HEK-293T cells to 10% of the control level, whereas the level of GAPDH RNA remained unchanged (Fig. 4A). TORC3 siRNA treatment also resulted in an approximately two-thirds decrease in Tax-mediated transactivation, as measured by pTxRE-luc and pLTR-luc expression (Fig. 4, B and C). The values of luciferase activity after 48 h of transfection were almost same as those observed at 24 h (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that TORC3 plays an important role in Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR.Fig. 4Tax-mediated transcription depends on endogenous TORC3. A, suppression of endogenous TORC3 by siRNA. Duplexes of 21-nucleotide TORC3 siRNA and control siRNA (random 21-nucleotide sequences) were transfected into HEK-293T cells in 6-cm dishes.

We have examined the interaction of PITX2 isoforms with myocyte-enhancing factor 2A (MEF2A), which is a known regulator of cardiac development. A direct interaction between PITX2a and MEF2A was demonstrated using yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. To study the functional significance of this interaction, we used the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) promoter. Coexpression of MEF2A and PITX2a or Pitx2c resulted in a strong synergistic activation of the ANF promoter in LS8 oral epithelial cells but not in other cell lines (NIH/3T3, Chinese hamster ovary, or C2C12). The synergism was dependent on promoter context, because it required MEF2 binding sites and was not seen with two other PITX2 target promoters. DNA binding by MEF2A was required but not sufficient for synergism. Upstream activators of p38 MAP kinases, MKK3 and MKK6, increased PITX2a and Pitx2c activity to yield up to 90-fold activation of the ANF promoter in LS8 cells. Because Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is autosomal dominant and affects development of the oral epithelium, we tested one of the known PITX2 mutants. The PITX2a-K88E mutant protein suppressed wild type PITX2a synergism with MEF2A. These results demonstrate a promoter- and cell-specific functional interaction between PITX2 and MEF2A and suggest the possibility of coordinate control by these factors in the oral epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2148857842,"Anthrax lethal factor (LF) is a Zn2+-metalloprotease that cleaves and inactivates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEKs). We have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify a cluster of residues in domain II of LF that lie outside the active site and are required for cellular proteolytic activity toward MEKs. Alanine substituted for Leu293, Lys294, Leu514, Asn516, or Arg491 caused a 10–50-fold reduction in LF toxicity. Further, whereas pairwise substitution of alanine for Leu514 and either Leu293, Lys294, or Arg491 completely abrogated LF toxicity, pairwise mutation of Leu514 and Asn516 resulted in toxicity comparable with N516A alone. The introduction of these mutations reduced LF-mediated cleavage of MEK2 in cell-based assays but altered neither the ability of LF to bind protective antigen nor its ability to translocate across a membrane. Interestingly, direct in vitro measurement of LF activity indicated that decreased toxicity was not always accompanied by reduced proteolytic activity. However, mutations in this region significantly reduced the ability of LF to competitively inhibit B-Raf phosphorylation of MEK. These results provide evidence that elements of domain II are involved in the association of LF into productive complex with MEKs.

Anthrax toxin is derived from an exotoxin produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis.

Combinations of PA plus LF (lethal toxin) do not cause edema, but when injected intravenously rapidly induce hypotensive shock leading to death of the host (13Beall F.A. Taylor M.J. Thorne C.B. J.

LF is a large 776-amino acid (90.2-kDa) protein (21Bragg T.S. Robertson D.L. Gene. 1989; 81: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of LF has been solved to a resolution of 2.2 Å (22Pannifer A.D. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Renatus M. Petosa C. Bienkowska J. Lacy D.B. Collier R.J. Park S. Leppla S.H. Hanna P. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2001; 414: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). It is composed of four domains. Domain I comprises the NH2-terminal portion, which binds PA. Domain II (residues 263–297 and 385–550) shows structural similarity with the adenosine diphosphate-ribosylating toxin of Bacillus cereus but lacks the residues required for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide binding and catalysis. Domains III inserts into domain II and contains a series of four tandem imperfect repeats of a helix-turn element present in domain II. A previous report suggests this region is important for LF activity because deletion of the second imperfect repeat (residues 308–326) renders LF nontoxic (23Arora N. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acidic residues in domain III form specific contacts with the basic NH2 termini of MEKs. Domain IV has limited structural homology to thermolysin and contains the catalytic core. Quinn et al. (24Quinn C.P. Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20124-20130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that insertional mutagenesis within this domain (e.g. insertion of an Arg/Val dipeptide at residue 720) can eliminate the toxicity of LF without blocking its ability to bind PA. Elements of domains II, III, and IV together create a long catalytic groove into which the NH2 terminus of MEK fits, forming an active site complex. We have demonstrated the existence of an LF-interacting region located in the COOH-terminal region of MEK1, adjacent to a proline-rich region where other regulatory molecules, including B-Raf, interact with MEK (19Chopra A.P. Boone S.A. Liang X. Duesbery N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9402-9406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Mutation of conserved residues within this region prevents LF proteolysis of MEKs without altering the kinase activity of MEK (19Chopra A.P. Boone S.A. Liang X. Duesbery N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9402-9406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The precise function of the LF-interacting region is not certain, although we have hypothesized that it is required for MEK association with LF. If LF and MEK do indeed interact outside the active site complex, then it follows that there exists a corresponding region of LF in which the introduction of mutations at key residues should disrupt toxicity. In this article we have identified, using site-directed mutagenesis, a cluster of residues in domain II of LF that plays a key role in LF-mediated toxicity. Interestingly, alanine substitution of the residues in this cluster substantially reduces LF toxicity and blocks MEK cleavage in cells. Functional tests of these mutations indicate that loss of toxicity is not caused by interference with the ability of LF to bind PA, translocate across the membrane, or to cleave MEK in vitro but instead by a reduction in the ability of LF to interact with MEK. The region containing this cluster of residues could potentially serve as a therapeutic target for small molecule inhibitors that would disrupt LF-MEK association and block LF-mediated proteolysis of MEK. Cell Culture and Reagents—The murine macrophage-derived J774A.1 and the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) epithelial K1 cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). J774A.1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. CHO K1 were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Both cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Alanine substitutions in LF were generated by introducing mutations into a B. anthracis LF expression vector pSJ115 (25Park S. Leppla S.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 18: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) with the use of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions except that primer extension was allowed to continue for 18 min, and the deoxynucleotide triphosphate stocks were modified to reflect the high deoxyadenylate and deoxythymidylate content (70%) of the gene encoding LF (21Bragg T.S. Robertson D.L. Gene. 1989; 81: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The primers used for site-directed mutagenesis are listed in the supplementary data. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the region containing the mutation. In addition, the genes encoding all LF that demonstrated reduced toxicity were sequenced in their entirety to confirm that only the desired mutations were present. Protein Expression and Purification—To express the mutagenized proteins, they were first transformed into the Escherichia coli dcm-dam- strain SCS110 to obtain unmethylated plasmid DNA, which was then transformed into a nontoxigenic, sporulation-defective strain of B. anthracis (BH445 (25Park S. Leppla S.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 18: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)) as described elsewhere (26Quinn C.P. Dancer B.N. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136 (Pt 7): 1211-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To prepare crude preparations of secreted protein, a single colony of transformed cells was used to inoculate 5 ml of FA medium (27Singh Y. Chaudhary V.K. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19103-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were allowed to grow at 37 °C for 14–16 h. Culture supernatant (2 ml) was then concentrated using a centrifugal filter (Microcon 100K MWCO; Millipore), and protein was recovered in 40 μl of buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl). The concentration of each protein was estimated by direct comparison with Coomassie Blue-stained bovine serum albumin standards (0.5 and 2.0 mg/ml) after separation on 10–20% SDS-PAGE gels. To make high purity preparations of LF and PA, 50-ml cultures were used to inoculate 5 liters of FA medium in a BioFlo 100 fermentor (New Brunswick Laboratories) at 37 °C, pH 7.4, while sparging with air at 3 liter/min and with agitation set to increase from 100 to 400 rpm as level of dO2 dropped below 50%. After 17–18 h of growth, the cells were removed by centrifugation (3500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was sterile-filtered and concentrated by tangential flow filtration using a Millipore prep/scale-TFF cartridge with 1 ft2 of 30- kDa MWCO polyethersulfone membrane, collecting the filtrate at ∼50 ml/min under a 1-bar back pressure. Expressed protein was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and fast pressure liquid chromatography (FPLC) using phenyl-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose columns following the procedures of Park and Leppla (25Park S. Leppla S.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 18: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The concentration of each protein was estimated using the bicinchoninic acid method (28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) and by densitometric analyses of Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. For in vitro MEK cleavage assays NH2-terminal histidine-tagged MEK was prepared as described (15Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K. Fukasawa K. Paull K.D. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1998; 280: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). For all other experiments recombinant human MEK1 protein was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells that had been infected with baculovirus containing human MEK1 ligated into the pVL1393 vector backbone (pKM636). Protein was isolated from supernatants of lysed cells and was eluted over 10 column volumes in a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl from a 20-ml Q-Sepharose column. The peak fractions containing MEK were pooled and loaded directly onto a 10-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. After washing the column with 30 mm imidazole, MEK was eluted with 100 mm imidazole. At this point, the eluate was adjusted to 3 μm EDTA, 3 mm MnCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 units of protein phosphatase 1 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) were added to the reaction and was incubated at 30 °C for 4 h. The samples were then concentrated and applied to a 320-ml Sephacryl 200 column in 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. ERK2 protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by FPLC as described earlier (15Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K. Fukasawa K.

Cytotoxicity Assays—The cells were grown in 96-well plates to 70% confluence. To induce lysis, the cells were treated with culture medium containing lethal toxin (PA (0.1 μg/ml) plus LF (0.01–10,000 ng/ml)) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. At the end of the experiment, cell viability was determined using the CellTiter 96® aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of LF required to cause a 50% maximal decrease in absorbance at 570 nm (the EC50) was determined by linear regression. PA Binding and Translocation Assays—PA binding and translocation assays were performed as described by Lacy et al. (29Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Fouassier A. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3006-3010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and quantitated using a Packard Tri-Carb 3100TR liquid scintillation counter. MEK Proteolysis and B-Raf Kinase Assays—To assay MEK cleavage in cells we made lysates of J774A.1 macrophages that had been incubated for 2 h with 0.1 μg/ml PA and 0.01 μg/ml LF or LF mutants. The lysates were separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies raised against the NH2 or COOH termini of MEK2 (N-20 and C-16, 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In vitro MEK cleavage assays were performed using immunoblotting with antibodies raised against MEK (anti-MEK1/2, 1:1000; Cell Signaling) as described earlier (19Chopra A.P. Boone S.A. Liang X. Duesbery N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9402-9406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Alternatively, MEK cleavage was assayed indirectly by reacting a constant concentration of MEK with varying the amounts of LF, using MEK activity (i.e. ERK phosphorylation) as a readout for LF activity. Briefly, 0.35 μg of MEK1 was added to 3 μl of cleavage buffer (20 mm Mops, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of varying amounts of LF or mutant LF (0.002–10 μg) and in a total volume of 10 μl. These cleavage reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. After cooling on ice for 2 min, 10 μl of kinase buffer (0.5 mm ATP (diluted 9:1 with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham; 10 mCi/ml, 3000 mCi/mmol), 75 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 μg of ERK2) was added, and samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. After cooling on ice for 2 min one volume of 2× SDS buffer was added, and the samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 3 min. The proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis on 10% gels, and ERK2 phosphorylation was quantitated using a Fuji FLA-5000 PhosphorImager. B-Raf kinase assays were performed as described previously (19Chopra A.P. Boone S.A. Liang X. Duesbery N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9402-9406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and quantitated using a Fuji FLA-5000 PhosphorImager. The results were normalized to phosphorylation in the absence of LF and compared using an unpaired Students' t test. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Clustered Aliphatic Residues— Because a number of the conserved residues in the LF-interacting region are long chain aliphatic residues, we hypothesized that a complementary region on LF would contain clustered aliphatic residues and would lie close to the groove into which the NH2 terminus of MEK fits. A surface plot of LF shows three distinct clusters of aliphatic residues meeting this requirement (Fig. 1). The first is composed of aliphatic residues (Ile298, Ile300, Ile485, Leu494, and Leu514) present in domain II and lies at one end of the catalytic groove. The second (residues Ile322, Ile343, Leu349, Leu357, and Val362) is composed of elements of the second, third, and fourth imperfect repeats in domain III and lies at the opposite end of the catalytic groove. A third cluster present in domain IV (Leu450, Ile467, Leu677, Leu725, and Leu743) lies adjacent to the catalytic groove that receives the NH2 terminus of MEK. To test our hypothesis we used site-directed mutagenesis to substitute alanine for each of these residues and then evaluated the effects of these mutations upon LF activity using a macrophage toxicity assay (10Friedlander A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7123-7126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The average concentration of crude preparations of wild-type LF required to cause a 50% maximal decrease in absorbance/cell viability (the EC50) was 15.6 ± 16.7 nm. Mutation of most of the aliphatic residues tested caused a less than 5-fold reduction in toxicity (12.9 nm ≤ EC50 ≤ 84.3 nm; Fig. 2a and supplementary data) and were judged to have a neutral or marginal role in toxicity. By contrast, alanine substitution of Leu514 caused a greater than 50-fold reduction in toxicity (EC50 = 816 ± 137 nm; Fig. 2a). To determine whether other residues in this region of LF played a role in LF toxicity, we made alanine substitutions at surface-exposed residues that were in proximity to Leu514. Of these, Leu285, Arg290, Gln297, Glu515, and Lys518 were judged to have a neutral or marginal role in toxicity (40 nm ≤ EC50 ≤ 65 nm; Fig. 2b and supplementary data). By contrast, alanine substituted at Leu293, Lys294, Arg491, or Asn516 caused a greater than 10-fold reduction in toxicity (141 nm ≤ EC50 ≤ 419 nm; Fig. 2b). Interestingly, although pairwise mutation of Leu514 and either Leu293, Lys294, or Arg491 completely abrogated LF toxicity (Fig. 2c), pairwise mutation of Leu514 and Asn516 instead resulted in toxicity comparable with N516A alone (EC50 = 200 ± 98 nm for L514A/N516A versus 164 ± 13 nm for N516A; Fig. 2c). These results indicate that subtle perturbations of the surface composition of domain II caused by alanine substitution of these residues can have a substantial impact upon LF toxicity. Point Mutations in Domain II Reduce Neither the Affinity of LF for PA nor Its Ability to Translocate across the Plasma Membrane—LF is a Zn2+-metalloprotease that specifically cleaves the NH2 termini of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases. To determine whether clustered residues in domain II are required for LF proteolytic activity, we assayed MEK2 cleavage by immunoblotting in J774A.1 macrophages that had been treated for 2 h with PA (0.1 μg/ml) plus wild-type LF or LF containing alanine mutations (0.01 μg/ml) in this region. Of the proteins tested, only wild-type LF and LF containing alanine mutations that had a neutral or marginal effect on toxicity were able to cleave the NH2 terminus of MEK2 (Fig. 3a). By contrast, L293A, K294A, R491A, L514A, and N516A as well as the double mutants L293A/L514A, K294A/L514A, R491A/L514A, and L514A/N516A caused no or reduced MEK2 cleavage. These results are consistent with our observation that only these residues of domain II play key roles in LF toxicity. However, the preceding assay is cell-based and does not distinguish between decreased toxicity caused by a reduced ability of LF to bind PA, to translocate across the endosomal membrane, or to cleave MEKs. Subsequent analyses were performed to elucidate the mechanism by which these mutations interfere with toxicity. To test whether our mutant LF were able to bind PA and translocate across the membrane, we performed binding and translocation assays using [35S]Met-labeled LF. In these assays LF and PA63 are allowed to bind ANTXR on CHO K1 cells at 4 °C, at which temperature endocytosis does not occur. As a negative control we used LF containing an alanine substitution at LF (Y236A), which has been previously shown to be incapable of binding to PA (29Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Fouassier A. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3006-3010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After unbound protein was washed away, the cells were treated with low or neutral pH buffer. The low pH buffer mimics the endosomal environment and triggers PA63 pore formation and the subsequent translocation of LF to the cytosol. After this, cells were exposed to Pronase to remove any surface-bound label, washed, lysed, and assayed for 35S content. As shown in Fig. 3 (b and c), wild-type and mutant LF were equally capable of binding PA63 and translocating across the plasma membrane. Consistent with published reports (29Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Fouassier A. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3006-3010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), LF (Y236A) did not appreciably bind PA63 in the same assays. The ability of wild-type and mutant LF to bind PA was confirmed independently by nondenaturing gel shift assays using LF and trypsin-nicked PA (PA63) (data not shown, but see first supplementary figure). These results indicate that loss of toxicity in mutant LF can be explained neither by a loss of the ability to bind PA nor by an inability to translocate across a cell membrane. Point Mutations in Domain II Do Not Alter LF Proteolytic Activity—Because the preceding assays were performed with relatively crude preparations of protein, it remained a possibility that the results we observed were caused by the effects of contaminants upon mutant LF and not wild-type LF activity. To test this we purified wild-type LF and selected LF double mutants by FPLC and reassessed the toxicity of these preparations using macrophage cytotoxicity assays. The EC50 of wild-type LF was 10.9 ± 5.9 nm (Fig. 4a), whereas FPLC-purified L514A proved to be less toxic (EC50 > 1,000 nm). As noted for crude preparations of protein, the substitution of a second alanine residue for N516 in L514A partially restored the toxicity of this mutant (EC50 = 427 ± 74 nm). FPLC-purified K294A/L514A and R491/L514A were nontoxic (EC50 >> 10,000 nm). Because FPLC-purified LF and LF mutants possess toxicities that are similar to those of crude preparations of the same proteins, it is unlikely that their reduced toxicities may be attributed to the presence of contaminants. To this point our analyses indicate that point mutations at clustered residues of domain II reduce the proteolytic activity of LF. To directly test this, we assayed the proteolytic activity of FPLC-purified wild-type and mutant LF in vitro by immunoblotting. As a control we included FPLC-purified preparations of LF harboring a point mutation in the Zn2+-binding domain (E687C), which has been previously characterized as being nontoxic (30Klimpel K.R. Arora N. Leppla S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and proteolytically inactive (15Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K. Fukasawa K. Paull K.D. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1998; 280: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Incubation of 0.2 μg of wild-type LF, but not E687C, with 0.2 μg of NH2-terminally His6-tagged MEK1 increased the electrophoretic mobility of MEK1, consistent with NH2-terminal proteolysis as described previously (15Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K. Fukasawa K. Paull K.D. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1998; 280: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, none of the mutant LF showed reduced proteolytic activity toward MEK (Fig. 4b). However, this sort of cleavage assay is qualitative in nature and may not reveal partial reduction of proteolytic activity. To address this we performed cleavage assays in which we varied the concentration of LF in the presence of a constant amount of MEK and used the kinase activity of MEK toward ERK as a indirect, but quantifiable, measure of proteolysis. Wild-type LF caused a robust inhibition of MEK activity and resulted in a 50% suppression of ERK phosphorylation at a molar ratio (LF:MEK) of 0.5 ± 0.3 (Fig. 4b). By contrast, E687C had no effect on MEK activity except when present in excess. Consistent with the observed toxicity of these mutants, K294A/L514A and R491A/L514A showed markedly reduced proteolytic activity, causing a 50% suppression of ERK phosphorylation at molar ratios of 1.9 ± 1.1 and 1.6 ± 0.4, respectively. Unexpectedly, L514A and L514A/N516A possessed proteolytic activity that was comparable with wild-type activity, causing a 50% suppression of ERK phosphorylation at a molar ratios of 0.9 ± 0.1 and 0.8 ± 0.3, respectively. These data indicate that although clustered point mutations in domain II decrease LF toxicity, this loss may not be entirely attributed to decreased proteolytic activity. An alternative explanation for our observations is that decreased LF toxicity may be caused by a loss of substrate affinity that is independent of its proteolytic activity. In lieu of a direct assay of LF binding to MEK, we previously demonstrated that LF could competetively inhibit B-Raf phosphorylation of MEK and that this inhibition was independent of its proteolytic activity (19Chopra A.P. Boone S.A. Liang X. Duesbery N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9402-9406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our interpretation of these results was that LF and B-Raf bound adjacent or overlapping epitopes on MEK. To determine whether point mutations at clustered residues of domain II reduce the affinity of LF for MEK, we assayed in vitro B-Raf-mediated MEK phosphorylation in the presence of LF or LF mutants. As we reported earlier, LF caused an ∼35% inhibition of MEK phosphorylation by B-Raf, and this effect was independent of LF proteolytic activity because E687C also inhibited MEK phosphorylation by B-Raf (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, whereas L514A and L514A/N516A had an effect that was similar to that of wild-type LF on MEK phosphorylation, K294A/L514A and R491A/L514A showed significantly reduced inhibition, blocking only 10 ± 7% (p = 0.014, df = 6) and 2 ± 5% (p = 0.0026, df = 6) of Raf-mediated phosphorylation, respectively (Fig. 4c). These data indicate that decreased LF toxicity resulting from point mutations in clustered residues in domain II may be attributed in part to a decreased ability interact with MEK. LF is the principal virulence factor of anthrax toxin (31Cataldi A. Labruyere E. Mock M. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32Pezard C. Berche P. Mock M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pezard C. Duflot E. Mock M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2459-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To date, its only identified substrates are members of the MEK family of protein kinases. Consequently, the interaction between LF and MEK is an important concern for understanding the pathogenesis of anthrax as well as in the design of targeted therapeutic agents. This study was undertaken to identify regions of LF that are required for interaction with MEK. As a starting point, we reasoned that because a number of the conserved residues in the LF-interacting region are long chain aliphatic residues, any region of LF with which it associated would (i) contain a cluster of surface-exposed aliphatic residues and (ii) lie adjacent to the catalytic groove where the active site complex would form. Regardless of the physiological relevance of these assumptions, tests of this hypothesis led to our identification of a single residue (Leu514) in domain II that, when replaced by an alanine residue, caused a substantial reduction in the toxicity of LF. Further alanine substitution in the vicinity of Leu514 identified four additional residues that also play a role in LF toxicity. Although separated in primary sequence, the tertiary structure of LF brings these five residues side by side in a focused region that lies at one end of the groove that forms between domains III and IV and contains the active site (see second supplementary figure). What role does this region play in LF toxicity? One key observation is that although mutant LF (i.e. L514A and L514A/N516A) were incapable of cleaving MEK in cell-based assays, they did so in vitro. This indicates that these mutants are sensitive to the context in which they encounter their substrate MEKs. In cells, the spatial distribution and accessibility of MEKs are influenced by scaffolding proteins such as MP1 (34Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and JIP-1 (35Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In addition, cellular MEKs may be modified post-translationally (e.g. by phosphorylation) and can associate with their cognate mitogen-activated protein kinases as well as other regulatory molecules such as B-Raf. Any of these factors may limit the ability of mutant LF to bind and cleave MEKs in cells. Indeed, although the MEK1 scaffolding protein MP1 can associate with both recombinant MEK1 and MEK2 in vitro, it can only bind MEK1 in cells (34Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that the simplest interpretation of our observations is that the region we have identified defines a site that is necessary for LF to associate into a productive complex with MEKs. Several observations support this hypothesis: (i) the effect of the mutations was specific; only mutations in this region, but not in clusters II or III, decreased LF toxicity; (ii) decreased toxicity was accompanied by decreased proteolysis of MEK2 in cells; (iii) mutations in this region altered neither binding to PA nor translocation of LF across the cell membrane; (iv) the LF mutants L514A and L514A/N516A possessed in vitro proteolytic activity that was comparable with that of wild-type LF; (v) the LF mutants K294A/L514A and R491A/L514A display reduced ability to competetively inhibit B-Raf phosphorylation of MEK; and (vi) the region identified on domain II is spatially distinct from the active site and thus is not likely to directly participate in substrate proteolysis. An alternative explanation, i.e. that the mutations introduce gross structural changes in LF that alter its biochemical activity, is unlikely because mutant LF not only retained the ability to bind PA and internalize into cells but also (in the case of L514A and L514A/N516A) possessed wild-type levels of proteolytic activity. The precise role this region plays in promoting the association of LF into a productive complex with MEKs is not clear. One possibility is that this region is required to direct LF to MEKs within cells. In this case, mutations in this region of domain II would reduce the ability of LF to associate with proteins which co-localize with MEKs. Alternatively, this region may play a direct role in binding MEKs. The latter possibility is supported by our observations that the LF mutants K294A/L514A and R491A/L514A display reduced ability to competetively inhibit B-Raf phosphorylation of MEK. Moreover, indirect evidence supports the hypothesis that LF and MEK interact at sites outside the active site. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis to identify binding partners of LF, Vitale et al. (16Vitale G. Pellizzari R. Recchi C. Napolitani G. Mock M. Montecucco C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) isolated cDNA for MEK2 that lacked the NH2-terminal cleavage site. In addition, we earlier demonstrated the existence of a conserved region located in the COOH terminus of MEK1, which is required for LF-mediated proteolysis of MEKs (19Chopra A.P. Boone S.A. Liang X. Duesbery N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9402-9406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recent publications have identified lead compounds that may be adapted for use as small molecule inhibitors of LF activity (36Dell'Aica I. Dona M. Tonello F. Piris A. Mock M. Montecucco C. Garbisa S. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37Min D.H. Tang W.J. Mrksich M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 38Turk B.E.

Seveso M. Marin O. Mock M. Montecucco C. Nature. 2002; 418: 386Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These molecules were initially identified by LF cleavage assays that used optimized peptide substrates that mimic the NH2-terminal cleavage site on MEKs. However, as we have demonstrated, sites outside the active site complex on both LF and MEK are required for efficient proteolysis of MEK. Thus, we propose that alternative therapeutic strategies that employ molecules that are targeted to the region of LF defined by these residues may, alone or in combination with those identified molecules that target the active site of LF, form the basis of a novel and more effective anthrax therapeutic.

Full activation of ERK2 requires dual phosphorylation of Thr183 and Tyr185 in the activation loop. Tyr185 dephosphorylation by the hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) represents an important mechanism for down-regulating ERK2 activity. The bisphosphorylated ERK2 is a highly efficient substrate for HePTP with a kcat/Km of 2.6 × 106m–1 s–1. In contrast, the kcatK/m values for the HePTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of Tyr(P) peptides are 3 orders of magnitude lower. To gain insight into the molecular basis for HePTP substrate specificity, we analyzed the effects of altering structural features unique to HePTP on the HePTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate, Tyr(P) peptides, and its physiological substrate ERK2. Our results suggest that substrate specificity is conferred upon HePTP by both negative and positive selections. To avoid nonspecific tyrosine dephosphorylation, HePTP employs Thr106 in the substrate recognition loop as a key negative determinant to restrain its protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. The extremely high efficiency and fidelity of ERK2 dephosphorylation by HePTP is achieved by a bipartite protein-protein interaction mechanism, in which docking interactions between the kinase interaction motif in HePTP and the common docking site in ERK2 promote the HePTP-catalyzed ERK2 dephosphorylation (∼20-fold increase in kcat/Km) by increasing the local substrate concentration, and second site interactions between the HePTP catalytic site and the ERK2 substrate-binding region enhance catalysis (∼20-fold increase in kcat/Km) by organizing the catalytic residues with respect to Tyr(P)185 for optimal phosphoryl transfer.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The extent and duration of MAP kinase activation in response to extracellular stimuli are tightly regulated in a cell type- and stimulus-dependent manner, because of the coordinated action of protein kinases and phosphatases. Full activation of the MAP kinases requires dual phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues in the activation loop by specific MAP kinase kinases. Down-regulation of MAP kinase activity is carried out by multiple protein phosphatases, including Ser/Thr-specific, Tyr-specific, and dual specificity phosphatases (4Zhou B. Wang Z.-X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This would inevitably lead to the formation of monophosphorylated MAP kinases. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that both forms of the monophosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), a founding member of the MAP kinase family, exist in living cells, in addition to the bisphosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms (5Yao Z. Dolginov Y. Hanoch T. Yung Y. Ridner G. Lando Z. Zharhary D. Seger R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activity of the monophosphorylated ERK2/pY and ERK2/pT is ∼2 and 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the unphosphorylated ERK2 and is only 1 and 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the fully active bisphosphorylated ERK2/pTpY (7Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the monophosphorylated ERK2s may have distinct biological roles in vivo. There is considerable complexity in the regulation of ERK2 activity by protein phosphatases. Partial ERK2 inactivation can occur through the action of protein Ser/Thr phosphatase PP2A, which targets the Thr(P) in the activation loop, resulting in an ∼100-fold decrease in ERK2 kinase activity (4Zhou B. Wang Z.-X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 7Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Complete ERK2 inactivation can be accomplished by the dual specificity MAP kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3), which is capable of removing phosphoryl groups from both Thr(P) and Tyr(P) (8Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 9Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition to PP2A and MKP3, biochemical studies suggest that distinct protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are also involved in ERK2 inactivation (10Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T.

Cell. 1999; 10: 3729-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mating pheromone-induced activation of MAP kinase Fus3 and Kss1 is tightly regulated by the concerted action of the dual specificity phosphatase Msg5 and the PTPs, Ptp2 and Ptp3 (12Zhan X.L. Deschenes R.J. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1690-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical analyses have shown that the tyrosine-specific phosphatase, PTP-ER, functions to directly down-regulate ERK activity during Drosophila eye development (13Karim F.D. Rubin G.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 741-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mammalian orthologs of the Drosophila PTP-ER include the hematopoietic PTP HePTP (also known as leukocyte PTP) (14Zanke B. Suzuki H. Kishihara K. Mizzen L. Minden M. Pawson A. Mak T.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and the brain-specific PTPs STEP (striatum-enriched PTP) (15Lombroso P.J. Murdoch G. Lerner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and PTP-SL (STEP-like PTP) (16Ogata M. Sawada M. Fujino Y. Hamaoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2337-2343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent biochemical studies indicate that HePTP, STEP, and PTP-SL negatively regulate the ERK2 pathway by dephosphorylation of Tyr(P)185 in the activation loop of ERK2 (17Pulido R. Zuniga A.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 858-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), resulting in a 10-fold decrease in ERK2 kinase activity (7Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Wang Z.-X. Zhou B. Wang Q.M. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7849-7857Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The fact that multiple phosphatases are involved in the regulation of MAP kinase suggests that phosphatases may play a crucial role in controlling cellular responses to external stimuli and determining the time course, threshold for activation, and efficiency of MAP kinase signaling. Although the PTPs have conserved catalytic domains and share a common mechanism of action (hydrolysis of Tyr(P)) (25Zhang Z.-Y. Prog. Nuc. Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 171-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the cellular processes in which they are involved can be both highly specialized and fundamentally important, in large part because of the distinct substrate specificity of individual PTPs. Thus, to fully understand the role of PTPs in signal transduction, it is necessary to have a detailed understanding of how they recognize their substrate. Recently, we carried out a rigorous kinetic analysis of ERK2/pTpY dephosphorylation by 11 protein phosphatases, many of which were previously implicated to be involved in ERK2 regulation (4Zhou B. Wang Z.-X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Only PP2A, MKP3, and HePTP were found to be likely ERK2 phosphatases. The kcat/Km value for the HePTP-catalyzed ERK2 dephosphorylation is 2.2 × 106m–1 s–1, which is similar to those of PP2A and MKP3, indicating that ERK2/pTpY is a highly efficient substrate for HePTP. In contrast, the kcat/Km of the prototypical PTPs, PTP1B and CD45, toward ERK2 is 2–3 orders of magnitudes lower than that of HePTP. These results provide biochemical evidence that PTPs display exquisite specificity in their substrate recognition. However, how HePTP achieves its substrate specificity at the molecular level is not well understood. To gain insight into this question, we studied the effects of altering amino acids unique to HePTP on ERK2 dephosphorylation catalyzed by HePTP. We have identified structural features in HePTP that mediate specific ERK2 recognition and inactivation as well as elements that prevent nonspecific Tyr(P) dephosphorylation by HePTP. Expression and Purification of HePTP and Its Mutants—The coding sequence for the full-length HePTP and the NH2-terminal truncated HePTP/Δ31 were produced by PCR using pGEX-3X-HePTP360 as a template (7Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the full-length HePTP, the oligonucleotides GCCCATATGACCCAGCCTCCGCCTGA (NdeI site underlined) and GCGGATCCTCAGGGGCTGGGTTCCT (BamHI site underlined) were used as the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. For HePTP/Δ31, the 5′ primer was GCCCATATGTCCCTGGGGGCCGTAGA (NdeI site underlined), and the 3′ primer was the same as that for the full-length HePTP. The PCR products containing the 5′ NdeI site and 3′ BamHI site were subcloned into pET28a vector (Novagen). All of the point mutants of HePTP were generated by PCR using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pET28a-HePTP as the template. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To produce the HePTP(1–71)-PTP1B(1–321) chimera, the plasmid pET28a-HePTP(1–71)-GT-PTP1B(1–321) was constructed by a QuikChange PCR using pET28a-HePTP as template and oligonucleotides CAGCGCCAGCCACCCGGTACCAAGCAACTGGAAG and CTTCCAGTTGCTTGGTACCGGGTGGCTGGCGCTG (KpnI site underlined, mutated nucleotide in bold) as primers, to create a KpnI site in HePTP coding sequence (nucleotide 214, 216, and 217 mutated). The resulting mutant pET28a-HePTP/S72G/P73T was subjected to KpnI/BamHI digestion, and the larger DNA fragment (∼5.5 kb) was recovered, resulting in the removal of the coding sequence for HePTP residues 73–339. For the second half of the chimera, PCR was performed to amplify the coding sequence for PTP1B residues 1–321, using pT7–7-PTP1B(1–321) (26Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13420-13425Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) as the template and oligonucleotides CCCCGGTACCATGGAGATGGAAAAGGAGTTCGAGC (KpnI site underlined) and GACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGCGCG (BamHI site underlined) as the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. The PCR product was subjected to KpnI/BamHI digestion and ligated with the HePTP DNA fragment mentioned above, yielding an expression vector for NH2-terminal His-tagged HePTP-PTP1B chimera HePTP(1–71)-Gly-Thr-PTP1B(1–321). Another chimera HePTP(1–35)-PTP1B(1–321) expression vector pET28a-HePTP(1–35)-Thr-PTP1B(1–321) was constructed in the same way as that of the plasmid pET28a-HePTP(1–71)-Gly-Thr-PTP1B(1–321). All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The NH2-terminal His6-tagged HePTP and its mutants as well as HePTP-PTP1B chimeras were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using the standard procedures of nickel chelate affinity chromatography. Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford dye binding assay (Advanced Protein Assay Reagent, Cytoskeleton Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PTP1B and its mutants were expressed and purified as previously described (26Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13420-13425Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The purified protein was made to 30% glycerol and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of ERK2/pTpY—The recombinant kinase inactive His6-ERK2/K52R was purified and phosphorylated by a constitutively active MEK1 (MEK1/G7B) (27Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuura J.E. Manning M.C. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as previously described (9Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) except that no radioactive ATP was used. After the dialysis against 50 mm NaCl in buffer A (20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4), the phosphorylated ERK2 was purified by a MonoQ HR5/5 column and was eluted by a NaCl gradient from 50 to 400 mm in buffer A. The fractions of peak 1 (form 120 to 150 mm NaCl) were pooled, concentrated, and stored at –80 °C. The stoichiometry of the bisphosphorylated ERK2/K52R/pTpY was assessed using procedures similar to those described previously (7Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Determination of Kinetic Parameters Using pNPP, Tyr(P)-containing Peptides, and ERK2/pTpY as Substrates—Kinetic parameters for the PTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP were determined at 30 °C in pH 7 buffer containing 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate, 1 mm EDTA with an ionic strength of 150 mm adjusted by addition of NaCl as described previously (4Zhou B. Wang Z.-X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of Tyr(P)-containing peptides catalyzed by PTP was measured using a continuous spectrophotometric or fluorimetric assay as previously described (28Zhang Z.-Y. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Maclean D. Roeske R. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). All of the assays were conducted at 30 °C and in the same assay buffer as the pNPP assay. For HePTP and its mutants other than D236A, 20–80 μm of the phosphotyrosine-containing peptides were used, which was much less than the Km values. When the enzyme concentration used was greatly less than substrate concentration, the reaction is first order with respect to substrate concentration, the kcat/Km value for the phosphatase was obtained by fitting the progress curve to Equation 1.[P]=[S]×[1−e−(kcat/Km)×[E]×t](Eq. 1) For PTP1B and HePTP-PTP1B chimeras, the Tyr(P)-containing peptide concentrations were from 50 to 100 μm, which was greatly larger than the Km values. When enzyme concentration used was greatly less than substrate concentration, the kcat and Km values for the enzyme were obtained by fitting the progress curves to Equation 2.t=p/kcatE+(Km/kcatE)ln[p∞/(p∞−p)](Eq. 2) Because the kcat and Km for HePTP/D236A are much lower than those of the wild-type enzyme, the kinetic parameters for the HePTP/D236A-catalyzed Tyr(P) peptide hydrolysis were determined using an enzyme-coupled continuous spectrophotometric assay (7Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The peptide concentration ranged from 0.2 to 5 Km. Because the enzyme concentration used was comparable with that of substrate concentration in this experiment, the kinetic parameters were obtained from a fit of the initial velocity versus substrate concentration data to Equation 3.v=0.5×kcat×{(Km+[E]+[S])−(km+[E]+[S])2−4×[E]×[S]]1/2}(Eq. 3) Kinetic parameters for the dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated ERK2 protein were determined using a continuous spectrophotometric assay described previously (4Zhou B.

A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). HePTP is a cytosolic enzyme of hematopoietic origin that is most similar to the brain-specific PTPs STEP and PTP-SL (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis suggests that the catalytic domains of HePTP, STEP, and PTP-SL possess all of the invariant residues characterizing the PTP family. Many of these invariant residues are important for either catalysis and/or structural integrity (25Zhang Z.-Y. Prog. Nuc. Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 171-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and they are unlikely to confer PTP substrate specificity. In addition, the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of PTP-SL encompassing residues 254–549, which correspond to residues 44–338 in HePTP, highly resembles those of other PTPs (30Szedlacsek S.E. Aricescu A.R. Fulga T.A. Renault L. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Given the overall structural similarities of the PTP-SL catalytic domain to other PTPs, it is uncertain what are the molecular determinants for specific ERK2 dephosphorylation by this group of PTPs. A unique property of the HePTP subfamily of PTPs is the existence of a kinase interaction motif (KIM, residues 17–30 in HePTP) NH2-terminal to the catalytic domain that is directly involved in ERK2 binding (17Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19Saxena M. Williams S. Brockdorff J. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol.

Aricescu A.R. Fulga T.A. Renault L. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it is unclear how KIM contributes to the specificity of HePTP toward ERK2. Finally, it is also not known how HePTP avoids nonspecific dephosphorylation of Tyr(P)-containing proteins other than ERK2. To begin to delineate the molecular determinants for HePTP substrate recognition, we decided to focus on amino acid residues that are unique to HePTP, STEP, and PTP-SL (Fig. 1). Specifically, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis of HePTP in the KIM sequence (residues 17–30), α0 helix (residues 48–55), α1-β1 loop (residues 85–112), the WPD loop (residues 232–243), α5 helix (residues 298–308), α5-α6 loop (residues 309–315), and α6 helix (residues 316–331). The KIM sequence is important for ERK2 binding (17Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19Saxena M. Williams S. Brockdorff J.

In addition, we also prepared chimeric molecules in which the NH2-terminal segment of HePTP including the KIM sequence was fused to the catalytic domain of PTP1B. Effect of Mutations in HePTP on pNPP Hydrolysis—Wild-type and mutant HePTPs were expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE. We first evaluated the effects of amino acid substitutions in HePTP using pNPP as a substrate. All of the kinetic measurements were conducted at 30 °C in pH 7.0, 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer, containing 1 mm EDTA with an ionic strength of 0.15 m. The kinetic parameters for the wild-type and mutant HePTP-catalyzed pNPP hydrolysis are listed in Table I. Although the kcat and kcat/Km values for HePTP are several fold lower than those of PTP1B, the most thoroughly characterized prototypical PTP, they are within the range observed for mammalian PTPs. With the exception of Y104A, D236A, H237A, H237F, and Q314A, no significant differences in the kinetic parameters for pNPP hydrolysis were observed between the wild-type and mutant HePTPs.Table IKinetic parameters of HePTP and its mutants with pNPP as a substrate at pH 7 and 30 °CHePTPMutationkcatKmkcat/Kms-1mmm-1 s-1Wild typeNone3.81 ± 0.217.44 ± 0.83(5.12 ± 0.58) × 102KIM (17-30)ΔN 314.20 ± 0.046.15 ± 0.30(6.83 ± 0.34) × 102L17A4.12 ± 0.168.13 ± 0.66(5.07 ± 0.32) × 102Q18A4.60 ± 0.2511.50 ± 1.49(4.00 ± 0.41) × 102E19A3.70 ± 0.119.51 ± 0.60(3.89 ± 0.25) × 102R20A4.55 ± 0.219.99 ± 1.18(4.55 ± 0.41) × 102R21A4.95 ± 0.2110.02 ± 1.03(4.94 ± 0.51) × 102R20A/R21A3.09 ± 0.086.50 ± 0.44(4.75 ± 0.33) × 102S23D6.78 ± 0.297.24 ± 0.69(9.36 ± 0.89) × 102N24A7.45 ± 0.337.52 ± 0.73(9.91 ± 0.96) × 102V25A2.39 ± 0.1812.21 ± 2.55(1.96 ± 0.41) × 102L27A5.74 ± 0.339.44 ± 1.11(6.08 ± 0.72) × 102M28A7.54 ± 0.3412.78 ± 1.42(5.90 ± 0.66) × 102L29A5.42 ± 0.309.98 ± 1.39(5.43 ± 0.76) × 102D30A5.53 ± 0.288.46 ± 0.94(6.55 ± 0.73) × 102α0 (48-55)T45E5.73 ± 0.212.78 ± 0.23(2.06 ± 0.17) × 103R47A6.00 ± 0.3311.23 ± 1.50(5.34 ± 0.54) × 102E48A4.56 ± 0.279.63 ± 0.99(4.74 ± 0.49) × 102L54A2.21 ± 0.1911.7 ± 1.94(1.89 ± 0.26) × 102α1-β1 loop (85-112)F87A2.78 ± 0.316.72 ± 0.81(4.14 ± 0.50) × 102D94A3.68 ± 0.406.20 ± 0.38(5.94 ± 0.53) × 102I95A2.97 ± 0.166.01 ± 0.61(4.94 ± 0.51) × 102Y104A0.162 ± 0.01912.63 ± 1.7012.8 ± 1.7K105A4.34 ± 0.249.66 ± 1.03(4.50 ± 0.49) × 102T106A4.25 ± 0.216.91 ± 0.35(6.15 ± 0.32) × 102T106D5.23 ± 0.4512.63 ± 1.89(4.14 ± 0.62) × 102T106N3.44 ± 0.177.99 ± 0.73(4.31 ± 0.40) × 102T106V2.09 ± 0.087.54 ± 0.55(2.77 ± 0.21) × 102T106S4.10 ± 0.126.42 ± 0.44(6.39 ± 0.44) × 102T106L2.12 ± 0.125.25 ± 0.74(5.56 ± 0.78) × 102N110A2.67 ± 0.139.57 ± 0.98(2.79 ± 0.29) × 102P111A2.71 ± 0.137.12 ± 0.33(3.81 ± 0.18) × 102WPD loop (232-243)D236A0.0103 ± 0.00040.586 ± 0.05517.6 ± 1.2H237A0.753 ± 0.0607.88 ± 1.26(9.56 ± 1.54) × 101H237F0.562 ± 0.0505.59 ± 1.12(1.01 ± 0.21) × 102H237Q1.88 ± 0.127.96 ± 1.03(2.36 ± 0.31) × 102Q238G3.08 ± 0.156.95 ± 0.71(4.43 ± 0.45) × 102α5 (298-308)Q304A3.84 ± 0.308.41 ± 0.97(4.54 ± 0.53) × 102α5-α6 loop (309-315)Q314A0.454 ± 0.0352.31 ± 0.51(1.97 ± 0.44) × 102α6 (316-331)Y329A1.37 ± 0.109.18 ± 1.35(1.49 ± 0.22) × 102 Open table in a new tab Tyr104 is invariant among the PTPs and is equivalent to Tyr46 in PTP1B, which defines the depth of the active site and is engaged in hydrophobic packing with Tyr(P) in the substrate (32Jia Z.

Asp236 is likely the general acid catalyst based on the sequence alignment and the crystal structure of PTP-SL. Removal of the carboxylic acid at position 236 caused a large drop in HePTP activity, which is in agreement with other general acid deficient PTPs (25Zhang Z.-Y. Prog. Nuc. Acid Res. Mol.

In many PTPs, the corresponding residue at position 237 is a Phe (Phe182 in PTP1B). Previous studies showed that residues adjacent to the general acid can influence its precise positioning (35Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Eur. J.

To understand the physiological role of LAT2-mediated L-DOPA handling, we used 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA duplexes (siRNA) to specifically suppress LAT2 expression in LLC-PK1 cells, a cell line that retains several properties of proximal tubular epithelial cells and takes up L-DOPA largely through Na+-independent transporters. After cloning the LLC-PK1 LAT2 gene, one target region of LAT2 mRNA (nt 97-117) was selected by scanning the length of the LAT2 gene for AA-dinucleotide sequences and downstream 19 nucleotides. Levels of LAT2 cDNA, determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, were markedly (P<0.05) reduced by LAT2 siRNA but not by the mismatch LAT2 siRNA. The LAT2 siRNA but not the mismatch LAT2 siRNA, reduced by 85% [14C]-L-DOPA accumulation, a time- and concentration-dependent effect. The efflux of intracellular [14C]-L-DOPA was markedly increased (P<0.05) by L-DOPA and L-leucine. The [14C]-L-DOPA outward transport was decreased 90% by LAT2 siRNA, but not by the mismatch LAT2 siRNA. However, treatment with the siRNA LAT2 did not affect the L-DOPA-induced fractional outflow of [14C]-L-DOPA. The Na+-independent and pH-sensitive L-DOPA transporter may include the hetero amino acid exchanger LAT2, whose activation results in trans-stimulation of L-DOPA outward transfer.-Soares-da-Silva, P., Serrão, M.

The distances between the tryptophan residues and the FAD calculated from the PRE agree well with those observed in the x-ray structure (with an error of <3 Å). Subsequently, a single-stranded DNA containing 13C-labeled CPD was prepared, and the FAD-induced PRE of the NMR resonances from the CPD lesion in complex with the CPD photolyase was investigated. The distance between the FAD and the CPD calculated from the PRE is 16 ± 3 Å. The FAD-induced PRE was also observed in the CPD photolyase-double-stranded DNA complex. Based on these results, a model of the CPD photolyase-DNA complex was constructed, and the roles of Arg-201, Lys-240, Trp-247, and Trp-353 in the CPD-repair reaction are discussed.

Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). CPD formation is closely linked to deleterious effects, including mutation, cell death, and skin cancer. Organisms have a variety of enzymes that recognize and repair DNA lesions. CPD photolyases repair CPDs using visible or near-UV light (3Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 4Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). CPD photolyases induce in vivo photoreactivation, which prevents the deleterious effects of far-UV light (200–300 nm) by the concurrent or subsequent exposure to near-UV-visible (300–500 nm) light. CPD photolyases contain FAD as a catalytic cofactor. CPD photolyases repair the CPD by an electron transfer from photoactivated FAD to the CPD. The high quantum yield of the reaction (φ = 0.5–1.0) shows that CPD photolyases utilize light energy quite efficiently (5Payne G. Sancar A.

Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7614) Google Scholar), the distance and the relative orientation between donors and acceptors determines the efficiency of electron transfer reactions. Therefore, a structural analysis of the catalytic site of the enzyme is important for understanding the mechanism of the high efficiency of the reaction. The crystal structures of the CPD photolyases from Escherichia coli, Anacystis nidulans, and Thermus thermophilus HB8 were recently solved (8Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J.

However, the structure of a CPD photolyase in complex with CPD-containing DNA has not yet been determined.

PRE would be useful for determining the distance between FAD and CPD in the CPD photolyase-DNA complex, because the FAD in CPD photolyase can assume the radical semiquinone form (4Sancar A. Chem.

NMR Measurements—Three kinds of buffers were used for the NMR measurements: buffer I, 50 mm NaPi, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5% ethylene glycol, 10% D2O, was used for 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments; buffer II, in which the pH of the buffer I was changed to 7.3, was used for 31P one-dimensional experiments; buffer III, 50 mm NaPi, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 10 mm dithiothreitol-2H10, 5% ethylene glycol-2H6, and 100% D2O was used for 1H-13C HSQC experiments. For measuring the radical semiquinone form spectra, sodium dithionite was added to the purified enzyme to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the buffer was exchanged to the NMR buffers. The solution was concentrated to 0.1–0.2 mm using a Centriprep YM-30 (Millipore) filter, and lyophilized DNA was added to the enzyme solution. The mixture was transferred to an NMR tube in a nitrogen atmosphere, in the dark. Sodium dithionite was added to the NMR samples to a final concentration of 20 mm, to keep the enzyme in the reduced form. All NMR experiments were performed at 37 °C on a Bruker DRX 400 or Avance 500 spectrometer. Distance Determination Using PRE—NMR spectra were processed and analyzed with the program XWIN-NMR version 3.1 (Bruker). The distances between the observed tryptophan atoms and FAD were measured from the crystal structure of T. thermophilus CPD photolyase in the substrate-free form (10Komori H. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The unpaired electron in FAD is distributed throughout the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (25Weber S. Mobius K. Richter G. Kay C.W.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3790-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the effective distance should be the averaged distance. However, the distance is averaged by a function of r-6, and the averaged distance is close to the shortest distance (18Johnson P.E. Brun E. MacKenzie L.F. Withers S.G. McIntosh L.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 609-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the distances between the heavy atoms of the observed amide groups and the nearest heavy atoms of the isoalloxazine ring. The observed FAD-induced intensity reduction and the distances between the observed atoms and FAD were fit to the following equations, which represent the PRE effects during the evolution of 1H magnetization in HSQC measurements (19Battiste J.L. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5355-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), with the program Kaleida-Graph (Synergy Software),Intensity reduction ratio=1−Irad/Ired=1−R2exp(−R2spt)/(R2+R2sp)(Eq. 1) R2sp=Kr−6(4τc+3τc/(1+ωh2τc2))(Eq. 2) where Ired and Irad are the peak heights of the resonances in the reduced and radical semiquinone forms, respectively, R2 and R2sp are the transverse relaxation rates for the spins in the reduced and radical semiquinone forms, respectively, t is the total insensitive nucleic enhanced by polarization transfer evolution time of the HSQC experiments (9 ms), r is the distance between the observed atoms and the unpaired electron of FAD, τc is the correlation time for the electron-nuclear interaction, ωh is the Larmor frequency of hydrogen atoms, and K is 1.23 × 10-32 cm6 s-2. The PRE effects are negligible during the evolution of 13C and 15N magnetizations in HSQC measurements, because the K values for 13C and 15N nuclei are ∼1/16 and 1/100 to that of 1H nucleus, respectively. Indeed, the effects cause less than 0.2-Å differences in the calculated distances. Thus, these equations were used for both 1H-13C HSQC and 1H-15N HSQC experiments. FAD-induced PRE of NMR Resonances from CPD Photolyase—Prior to the determination of the intermolecular FAD-CPD distance by FAD-induced PRE, we investigated the FAD-induced intramolecular PRE to evaluate the distance dependence of the PRE. We used the enzyme with tryptophan selective labeling for the following reasons: (i) tryptophan residues are widely distributed throughout the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, and the distance between the tryptophan NH groups and the FAD ranges from 4.3 to 32.1 Å; (ii) the enzyme has 15 tryptophan residues, and the number of resonances is adequate for observing them without signal overlapping; and (iii) no metabolic migration occurs in the amino acid (tryptophan)-selective labeling. We measured the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the CPD photolyase labeled with [α,ϵ-15N]tryptophan (Fig. 1A, inset), in complexes with CPD-containing ssDNA, in the reduced and radical semiquinone forms, respectively (Fig. 1). In the spectrum of the enzyme in the reduced form (Fig. 1A), 30 resonances derived from 15 tryptophan residues were separately observed. Assignments of the cross-peaks were established by site-directed mutagenesis. In the spectrum of the mutant W351F (Fig. 1B), two resonances were not observed, in comparison with the wild type spectra, and thus the resonances were assigned as Trp-351. The resonances from Nα and Nϵ were distinguished by measuring the spectra of the enzyme labeled with [α-15N]- and [ϵ-15N]tryptophans, respectively (data not shown). In a similar way, all of the resonances in Fig. 1A were assigned. In the spectrum of the enzyme in the radical semiquinone form, the main-chain HNα resonances of Trp-247, Trp-351, and Trp-353 and the side-chain HNϵ resonances of Trp-241, Trp-247, Trp-351, and Trp-353 had disappeared, and those from HNα of Trp-49, Trp-228, Trp-241, Trp-260, Trp-285, Trp-383, and Trp-387 and HNϵ of Trp-260, Trp-275, Trp-328, and Trp-383 were significantly reduced in intensity, as compared with the spectrum of the enzyme in the reduced form (Fig. 1, A and C, and Table I). Based upon the spectra, the intensity reduction ratios of each residue were calculated. Fig. 2 shows the correlation between the intensity reduction ratio and the distance between the observed atoms and FAD in the crystal structure of the enzyme. All of the atoms with resonances absent from the radical form spectrum were within 13 Å of FAD, and all of the atoms with resonances significantly reduced in intensity in the radical form spectrum were 13–21 Å away from FAD.Table ICorrelation between the FAD-induced intensity reduction and the distance between the observed atoms and FAD Residues with resonances reduced in intensity by more than 10% are shown.

(19Battiste J.L. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5355-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). For the conversion, the τc and R2 values should be determined. However, the direct determination of accurate τc and R2 values is difficult in large proteins. In the present study, these values were evaluated by fitting the experimental values of the intensity reduction ratios and the distances in the three-dimensional structure to the equations. The evaluated τc and R2 values were 13 ns and 1.5 × 104 s-1, respectively. The τc value was reasonable for the molecular mass of the enzyme (47.8 kDa), whereas the R2 value was much larger than what we expected. The extraordinarily large R2 value indicates that R2/(R2 + R2sp) can be approximated to 1, and the intensity reduction is mainly derived from relaxation during the insensitive nucleic enhanced by polarization transfer. Therefore, the equation was simplified and the intensity reduction ratio was correlated with the distance between the observed atoms and FAD by Equation 3.Intensity reduction ratio=1−Irad/Ired=1−exp(−5.67×106×r(Å)−6)(Eq. 3) Using Equation 3, we calculated the distance between the observed atoms and FAD from the observed intensity reduction ratio, and we compared the calculated distance with the distance in the crystal structure (Table I). The difference between the calculated distance and the distance in the crystal structure was less than 3 Å. FAD-induced PRE of NMR Resonances from CPD-containing ssDNA—We determined the intermolecular FAD-CPD distance from the FAD-induced PRE in the CPD resonances using Equation 3. We prepared a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) containing 13C-labeled CPD, d[AT(CPD)TAC], and measured the 1H-13C HSQC spectra in complexes with deuterated CPD photolyase for the reduced and radical semiquinone forms, respectively (Fig. 3). Comparing the two spectra, the intensities of the resonances of the base (methyl and 6H) and the 1′-position in CPD were significantly decreased in the spectrum of the radical form complex, whereas those of the other deoxyribose resonances were decreased by <10% (Table II). The intensity reduction ratio indicates that the FAD-CPD distance in the CPD photolyase-ssDNA complex is 16 ± 3 Å (Table II).Table IIThe distances between the CPD and FAD in the CPD photolyase-DNA complex calculated from FAD-induced PRE Residues with resonances reduced in intensity by more than 10% are shown.ΔintaIntensity reduction ratio (= 1 – Irad/Ired)rcalcbThe distances were calculated from the intensity reduction ratio, using Equation 3 in the textÅCH3 (5′ side)0.2716.2CH3 (3′ side)0.2516.46HcOf the two resonances, we did not determine which is from the 5′ or 3′ side0.26, 0.3116.3, 15.71′cOf the two resonances, we did not determine which is from the 5′ or 3′ side0.16, 0.2417.8, 16.5a Intensity reduction ratio (= 1 – Irad/Ired)b The distances were calculated from the intensity reduction ratio, using Equation 3 in the textc Of the two resonances, we did not determine which is from the 5′ or 3′ side Open table in a new tab FAD-induced PRE of NMR Resonances from CPD-containing dsDNA—We aimed to evaluate the FAD-CPD distance in the enzyme-dsDNA complex. In the 1H NMR spectrum of d(CGCAAT[CPD]TAAGCCG)/d(CGGCTTAATTGCG) complexed with deuterated CPD photolyase, two resonances were observed that had chemical shifts similar to those of the methyl protons of the CPD lesion in the ssDNA-photolyase complex (Fig. 4) (20Torizawa T.

The intensity of these resonances was reduced by 50% in the radical form complex. The present study using FAD-induced PRE shows that the distance between FAD and CPD in the T. thermophilus CPD photolyase-DNA complex is ∼16 Å. In this study, the correlation between the FAD-induced intensity reduction and the distances between the observed atoms and FAD was investigated by the resonances from tryptophan residues. The intensity reduction ratios and the distances fit well with the Solomon-Bloembergen equation (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the intensity reduction observed in the radical semiquinone form was derived predominantly from FAD-induced PRE. This analysis is based on the assumption that the oxidation states of FAD do not significantly affect the conformation of the CPD photolyase-DNA complex. We concluded that this assumption is valid for the CPD photolyase-DNA complex for the following reasons. First, in the 31P NMR analysis of the CPD photolyase-DNA complex, the chemical shifts of the phosphates of CPD-containing DNA were not affected by the oxidation state (Fig. 5). The chemical shift values of the 31P NMR resonances are dependent on the backbone conformation of the DNA (26McAteer K. Jing Y. Kao J. Taylor J.S. Kennedy M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 1013-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and thus the result shows that the backbone conformation of CPD-containing DNA in the complex is not perturbed by the oxidation state. Second, the chemical shifts of the tryptophan residues in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra were not significantly affected by the oxidation state (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that the overall conformation of the enzyme is not significantly influenced by the oxidation state. Third, the chemical shifts of the resonances from the CPD in the complex were not affected by the oxidation state (Fig. 3). In addition to the conformation of the CPD, the aromatic groups in the CPD-binding site affect the chemical shifts of the resonances from CPD (20Torizawa T. Ueda T. Kuramitsu S. Hitomi K. Todo T. Iwai S. Morikawa K. Shimada I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32950-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results suggest that the conformation of the CPD-binding site is not significantly perturbed by the oxidation state. Finally, previous studies demonstrated that the affinity to CPD-containing DNA was not influenced by the FAD oxidation state (6Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Walsh C. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15406-15411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sancar G.B. Smith F.W. Reid R. Payne G. Levy M. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 478-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FAD-CPD distance in the CPD photolyase-DNA complex has been predicted in previous studies. Several groups have proposed CPD photolyase-DNA complex models, based on molecular dynamics simulations (28Antony J. Medvedev D.M. Stuchebrukhov A.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1057-1065Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 29Hahn J. Michel-Beyerle M.E. Rosch N. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 2001-2007Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Sanders D.B. Wiest O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5127-5134Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the relative orientations of FAD and CPD in the models did not agree with each other. Studies of the CPD photolyase-DNA complex using electron paramagnetic resonance (31Weber S. Richter G. Schleicher E. Bacher A. Mobius K. Kay C.W.M. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1195-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (32MacFarlane A.W. Stanley R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15203-15214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and resonance Raman spectroscopy (33Schelvis J.P.M. Ramsey M. Sokolova O. Tavares C. Cecala C. Connell K. Wagner S. Gindt Y.M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 12352-12362Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were recently reported. The studies were based on observations of the FAD signals and comparisons between the signals in the substrate-free form and those in the complex form. The FAD signals are equally perturbed by both the direct enzyme-DNA interactions and the DNA-induced conformational change of the enzyme. On the other hand, the present study was based on the observations of DNA signals and the comparison between the signals in the radical semiquinone form and those in the reduced form. The magnetic moment of an electron is 657 times that of a proton, and thus the FAD-induced PRE is dominant in the FAD-induced resonance perturbation as described above. For further insight into the CPD-repair mechanism, we constructed a model of the photolyase-DNA complex based on the NMR analysis results, as follows: (i) the CPD base is 16 Å away from FAD; (ii) the CPD bases are closer to FAD than the deoxyribose; and (iii) the 5′ and 3′ sides of the DNA bind to clusters I and II of the enzyme, respectively (20Torizawa T. Ueda T. Kuramitsu S. Hitomi K. Todo T. Iwai S. Morikawa K. Shimada I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32950-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The model revealed two characteristics. First, the O4 of the 5′ side of CPD is close to Arg-201 and Lys-240 (Fig. 6A). During the CPD repair reaction, a CPD anion intermediate is formed after the electron transfer from FAD to CPD (34Kim S.T. Sancar A. Essenmacher C. Babcock G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8023-8027Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Kim S.T. Volk M. Rousseau G. Heelis P.F. Sancar A. Michel-Beyerle M.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 3115-3116Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The O4 of the 5′ side of the intermediate is supposed to be negatively charged (36Langenbacher T. Zhao X.D. Bieser G. Heelis P.F. Sancar A. Michel-Beyerle M.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 10532-10536Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, Arg-201 and/or Lys-240 might form electrostatic interactions with the CPD anion intermediate, thus prolonging the lifetime of the CPD anion. Second, several aromatic groups exist between FAD and the CPD: Trp-247, Trp-353, and the adenine base of FAD (Fig. 6B). An electron may transfer from FAD to CPD via these aromatic groups in the CPD-repair reaction. Sanders et al. (30Sanders D.B. Wiest O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5127-5134Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) proposed that a direct electron transfer from FAD to the CPD is not preferable, based on a computer model in which FAD and the CPD are separated by >10 Å. Spacers between electron donors and acceptors, like Trp-247 and Trp-353, separate the donors and acceptors, leading to a decrease in the back electron transfer rate (37Kavamos G.J. Fundamentals of Photoinduced Electron Transfer. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1993: 185-234Google Scholar). The prolonged lifetime of the CPD anion intermediate reduced the back electron transfer rates, leading to the high efficiency of the reactions (37Kavamos G.J. Fundamentals of Photoinduced Electron Transfer. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1993: 185-234Google Scholar). Thus, Arg-201, Lys-240, Trp-247, and Trp-353 may play important roles in the CPD-repair reaction. To examine the role of Arg-201, Lys-240, Trp-247, and Trp-353 in the CPD-repair reaction, the CPD-repair activities of the mutants of these residues were measured (Table III). In the previous study, it was confirmed that the global folds and the structures around the FAD for all mutants were not affected by the introduction of the mutations, by their 1H NMR spectra, and UV-visible absorption spectra, respectively, and all mutants except for W353A in Table III exhibited similar substrate-binding activities, and they were remarkably lower than that of the wild type (20Torizawa T.

The R201A, K240A, W247A, and W353A mutants all exhibited significantly less repair activity than the wild type, whereas the mutants of other residues within the DNA-binding region, R141A and R376A, retained activity equivalent to that of the wild type. These results suggest that Arg-201, Lys-240, Trp-247, and Trp-353 play an important role in both the substrate-binding and the CPD-repair reaction.Table IIICPD-repair activity of the CPD photolyase mutants of the putative catalytically important residuesϵφaPhotoreactivation cross-section (ϵφ) at 370 nm was determined as previously described (24).

If the CPD bases are located inside the DNA helix in the complex, then the CPD should be more than 20 Å away from the FAD, and FAD should not induce PRE. Thus, the FAD-induced PRE in the CPD photolyase-dsDNA complex (Fig. 4) supports the CPD-flipping recognition mechanism. dsDNA containing 13C-labeled CPD will provide more information on the orientations of FAD and the CPD lesion in the enzyme-dsDNA complex and further evidence of the CPD flipping. The studies of model compounds, in which the isoalloxazine ring is designed to be close to the CPD base, have been performed, aiming toward the development of artificial photolyase enzymes that repair CPD in vivo and bring relief to patients suffering from xeroderma pigmentosum or trichothiodystrophy (39Carell T. Butenandt J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1997; 36: 1461-1464Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 40Carell T. Epple R. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 7: 1245-1258Crossref Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of the model compounds was less than one-tenth of that of the CPD photolyase. This study has shown that CPD photolyase may improve the efficiency of the reaction by inhibition of back electron transfer and stabilization of the CPD-anion intermediate. Improvement of the model compounds based on these results may increase their catalytic efficiency. The PRE effect provides the distance information in various systems (12Lietzow M.A. Jamin M.

In the present study, we demonstrate that PRE is useful also for analyzing the interactions between FAD-binding proteins and their ligands. CPD photolyase has 20–30% sequence homology with (6–4) photolyases and cryptochromes. The (6–4) photolyase uses light to repair the (6–4) photoproduct, which is another UV-induced DNA lesion (4Sancar A. Chem.

In this study, we have compared the activation potential of the different HIV-1 clade and HIV-2 LTRs and assessed their interaction with NFAT and NF-κB. In T-cell lines and primary CD4+ T-cells, the results showed that the HIV-1 clade E LTR (with a single NF-κB-binding site) was the weakest LTR regardless of the tested activators, whereas the HIV-2 LTR was the most responsive LTR. The clade E enhancer region was also demonstrated to be the weakest enhancer region in transfection experiments with luciferase reporter-based vectors. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with extracts from activated CD4+ T-cells indicated that, although NF-κB and NFAT bound all enhancers, HIV-1 clade E and HIV-2 LTR enhancers were poor binding targets for these two factors. Weak NFAT binding to clade E enhancers was also confirmed using NFAT1-expressing 293T cells in competition experiments. We have also shown the absence of interaction of NF-κB or NFAT with the third NF-κB repeat present in clade C. However, the clade C enhancer bound NFAT more efficiently than all other enhancer regions tested. Our results hence demonstrate for the first time that differences in the binding of NF-κB and NFAT to the enhancer regions could be responsible for some of the observed variation in HIV-1 clade LTR activation, whereas HIV-2 LTR activation seems mostly independent of these interactions. The enhancer region in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 5′-long terminal repeat (LTR) is very important for viral transcription.

In T-cells, the replicative cycle of this virus is greatly dependent on the activation state of the infected cells. Hence, in a high activation state, higher replication can be detected, which is mainly consequential to a higher level of transcription. HIV-1 transcription is dependent on the 5′-long terminal repeat (LTR) region, which harbors the important enhancer sequence. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a cellular transcription factor that has been demonstrated to be an essential regulator in the activation of the HIV-1 LTR through its interaction with the enhancer region (1Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). However, a series of studies have suggested that NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) could also bind to the HIV-1 enhancer region (–104 to –81) of the LTR and modulate overall LTR-mediated gene expression (10Brown K.

The predominant form of NF-κB implicated in the process of HIV-1 LTR activation is a heterodimer composed of the 50-kDa (p50) and 65-kDa (p65 or RelA) subunits (2Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 3Urban M.B. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 4Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). Recent findings have suggested that the effect of NF-κB on HIV-1 expression might depend on an increase in both initiation and elongation of transcription (5West M.J. Lowe A.D. Karn J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8524-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The NF-κB complex is usually retained in the cytoplasm as an inactive factor associated with a repressor termed IκBα that masks the nuclear localization signal (6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 8Latimer M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The sudden activation of NF-κB by a range of activators induces the release and degradation of IκBα subsequent to its phosphorylation, thereby allowing NF-κB to move freely from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (10Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 11Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D.

Nuclear NF-κB can subsequently act on the targeted genes.The NFAT members are part of a family of Rel-related transcription factors that are activated early after T-cell activation. Several NFAT family members are present in human T-cells, such as NFAT1 (NFATp), NFAT2 (NFATc), NFAT3, and NFAT4 (NFATx) (15Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and NFAT5 (16Trama J. Lu Q. Hawley R.G. Ho S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4884-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Like NF-κB, NFAT factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm and translocated to the nucleus following an increase in the intracellular calcium content (17Negulescu P.A. Shastri N. Cahalan M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2873-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 18Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Modulation of intracellular calcium triggers conformational changes in calmodulin and increases its binding to the calcineurin serine/threonine phosphatase, leading to its activation. The ensuing NFAT dephosphorylation by calcineurin renders the nuclear localization sequence accessible, allowing nuclear translocation (19Ruff V.A. Leach K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22602-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The consensus binding sequence for NFAT is 5′-(T/A)GGAAA(A/N)(A/T/C)-3′ (20Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). This sequence has similarity to the antisense strand in the NF-κB-binding sites located in the enhancer region of the HIV-1 LTR, which have thus been suggested to represent potential NFAT-binding sites (21Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 22Kinoshita S. Chen B.K. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Cell. 1998; 95: 595-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A recent study has provided evidence that NFAT1 interacts as a dimer on the HIV-1 enhancer region through a unique conformation (23Giffin M.J. Stroud J.C. Bates D.L. von Koenig K.D. Hardin J. Chen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Although the mechanism of action of these factors on HIV-1 LTR activation is now well documented, their implication in the transcription process following activation has not been clearly assessed in a comparative fashion in the various existing HIV-1 isolates. The known heterogeneity in HIV-1 sequences has led to the classification of the isolates in different clades. Presently, at least 10 distinct genetic subtypes (clades A–J) of HIV-1 have been identified based on phylogenetic analyses of gag and env genes (24Naghavi M.H. Schwartz S. Sonnerborg A. Vahlne A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1999; 15: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The different subtypes are not distributed evenly throughout the world. For example, subtype B predominates in North America and Europe, subtype C in South Africa and India, and subtype E in Northern Thailand (25Jeeninga R.E. Hoogenkamp M. Armand-Ugon M. De Baar M. Verhoef K. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3740-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). When representative isolates of the different clades are compared within the LTR sequence, a substantial degree of variability is apparent and is preserved in general within each clade (26Montano M.A. Novitsky V.A. Blackard J.T. Cho N.L. Katzenstein D.A. Essex M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8657-8665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the number of NF-κB repeats has been observed to vary from one to three between the different clades: two NF-κB-binding sites are present in the enhancer regions of clades A, B, D, F, and G; three in clade C; and only one in clade E (24Naghavi M.H. Schwartz S. Sonnerborg A. Vahlne A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1999; 15: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Montano M.A. Novitsky V.A. Blackard J.T. Cho N.L. Katzenstein D.A. Essex M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8657-8665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the closely related HIV-2 virus has also been demonstrated to vary in terms of its LTR structure compared with the HIV-1 LTR (27Berry N. Ariyoshi K. Balfe P. Tedder R. Whittle H. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2001; 17: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Tong-Starksen S.E. Welsh T.M. Peterlin B.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4348-4354PubMed Google Scholar). First, the typical enhancer sequence harbors only one NF-κB repeat, but in addition, the LTR region bears DNA-binding sites upstream of this latter enhancer region, which are presumed to play a substantial role in LTR activation (29Arya S.K. New Biol. 1990; 2: 57-65PubMed Google Scholar, 30Markovitz D.M. Smith M.J. Hilfinger J. Hannibal M.C. Petryniak B. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5479-5484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hannibal M.C. Markovitz D.M. Nabel G.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1839-1846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we were interested in determining whether the variable configuration of the different HIV-1 clade LTRs and the HIV-2 LTR could lead to an altered response to various T-cell-activating agents paralleled by a difference in the implication of the NF-κB and NFAT transcription factors. In this study, we report for the first time a comparison of the LTR activation of the different clades with various activators and in relation to the binding of both NFAT and NF-κB. We show that the HIV-1 clade E LTR was the weakest induced promoter in response to stimulation by different tested T-cell-activating agents. Surprisingly, HIV-2 was the most potently activated LTR, except when cells were activated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Moreover, we demonstrate that NF-κB and NFAT transcription factor binding to the enhancer regions of HIV-1 clade E (one NF-κB-binding site) and HIV-2 was weaker than to all the other clades. On the other hand, the third extra NF-κB-binding site present exclusively in the clade C LTR had no affinity for each of these factors. Our results also suggest that the sequence flanking the consensus sequence of NFAT-binding sites in the enhancer region could alter the affinity of NFAT for this sequence.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—We used the human CD4+ T-cell lines Jurkat (clone E6-1) (32Weiss A. Imboden J. Shoback D. Stobo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4169-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and SupT1 (33Smith S.D. Shatsky M. Cohen P.S. Warnke R. Link M.P. Glader B.E. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5657-5660PubMed Google Scholar) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The human embryonic kidney 293T cell line (kindly provided by Dr. W. C. Greene, J. Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA) was grown in similarly supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. DT30 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were derived from the mastocytoma P815 cell line and stably express human B7.1 and the murine Fcγ receptor (34Azuma M. Cayabyab M. Buck D. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). DT30 cells were grown in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored frozen at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline before use. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and subsequently isolated by negative selection using the CD4+ T-cell isolation kit and the AutoMACS device (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were subsequently resuspended in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium and directly tested. All cell lines and primary CD4+ T-cells were maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 humid atmosphere.Plasmids and Antibodies—Constructs pGL3-LTR-LUC(A), pGL3-LTR-LUC(B), pGL3-LTR-LUC(C), pGL3-LTR-LUC(D), and pGL3-LTR-LUC(E) were generated from vectors containing sequences (–174 to +46) of different HIV-1 clade LTRs positioned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. These HIV-1 5′-LTR regions originated from clade A (UG5218, GenBank™/EBI accession number AF102220), clade B (SE5648, accession number AF102210; and SE5611, accession number AF102212), clade C (GM6439, accession number AF102202), clade D (UG6357, accession number AF102223), and clade E (GM6452, accession number AF102205) (24Naghavi M.H. Schwartz S. Sonnerborg A. Vahlne A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1999; 15: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). LTR sequences were excised by XhoI (blunted) and BamHI and inserted in the pGL3basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) digested by SmaI/BglII. The plasmids pBlue3′LTR-LUC(B), pBlue3′LTR-LUC(C), and pBlue3′LTR-LUC(E) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Rockville, MD). These constructs contain the 3′-LTRs (–147 to +63) of clades B, C, and E, respectively, positioned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in pBluescript. Similar pBluescript-based constructs containing different clade E LTRs (LTR-24-3, LTR-4-1, and 3′-LTR E) (25Jeeninga R.E. Hoogenkamp M. Armand-Ugon M. De Baar M. Verhoef K. Berkhout B. J.

Emerman M. Sonigo P. Clavel F. Montagnier L. Alizon M. Nature. 1987; 326: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) through excision of the 5′-LTR sequence by NaeI and NarI, which was then cloned in the SmaI site of the pGL3basic vector after blunting. The pGL2tata-LUC vector was constructed by subcloning a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide (produced from hybridized oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGCGGGTATATAATGGATCCA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGGATCCATTATATACCCG-3′) containing a TATA box and extremities compatible with NheI/HindIII-digested ends of the pGL2basic vector. Based on the enhancer sequences of the different HIV-1 clade (A–E) LTRs above (24Naghavi M.H. Schwartz S. Sonnerborg A. Vahlne A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1999; 15: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), synthesized oligonucleotides corresponding to the sense and antisense strands of each enhancer region (see Table I) were hybridized and cloned into the SmaI site of the pGL2tata-LUC vector, thereby generating pGL2tata-enh-LUC(A), pGL2tata-enh-LUC(B), pGL2tata-enh-LUC(C), pGL2tata-enh-LUC(D), and pGL2tata-enh-LUC(E). The β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVβ was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The NFAT1 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Tim Hoey (Tularik Inc., San Francisco, CA) (37Hoey T.

Open table in a new tab Hybridomas producing anti-CD3 antibody OKT3 (specific for the θ chain of the CD3 complex) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Antibodies from this hybridoma cell line were purified with mAbTrap protein G affinity columns (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Rabbit antisera raised against the p50 subunit of NF-κB and antibodies specific for NFAT1 (anti-NFATp antibody) and for all NFAT family members (anti-panNFAT antibody) were generously supplied by Dr. Nancy R. Rice (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD).Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—Jurkat cells (5 × 106) were transiently transfected using a previously described DEAE-dextran protocol (38Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G. Olivier M. Faure R. Posner B.I. Tremblay M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were first washed with 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm KCl, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.7 mm CaCl2 and then incubated with 15 μg of luciferase reporter constructs and 5 μg of pCMVβ in 0.5 ml of the same buffer containing 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran for 25 min at room temperature. Afterward, 5 ml of supplemented RPMI 1640 medium were added to the cells along with 100 μm chloroquine, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 5 ml of supplemented RPMI 1640 medium and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. SupT1 cells were transiently transfected by a modified version of a previously described electroporation protocol (39Melkonyan H. Sorg C. Klempt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4356-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 × 106 cells were transfected with 15 μg of luciferase reporter constructs and 5 μg of pCMVβ in 400 μl of medium containing DEAE-dextran (10 μg/ml) and Me2SO (1.25%). Electroporation was performed using Gene-Pulser I (950 microfarads, 250 V; Bio-Rad) at room temperature. Shortly after, 5 ml of supplemented RPMI 1640 medium were added to the cells along with Me2SO (1.25%), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Transient transfection of 293T cells was conducted with the calcium phosphate transfection protocol as described previously (40Fortin J-F. Barbeau B. Hedman H. Lundgren E. Tremblay M.J. Virology. 1999; 257: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Primary CD4+ T lymphocytes were transfected with the Nucleofector device (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, unstimulated primary CD4+ T-cells (5 × 106 cells) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in the human T-cell Nucleofector solution with the indicated plasmids. The cell/DNA mixture was added to a cuvette, inserted in the Nucleofector, and transfected. CD4+ T-cells were then activated.For stimulation, transiently transfected T-cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells/well (100 μl) in 96-well plates. In the form of triplicates, cells were either left untreated or treated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA; 3 μg/ml; Sigma), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 20 ng/ml; Sigma), ionomycin (Iono; 1 μm; Sigma), bpV(pic) (10 μm; Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA), or TNFα (20 ng/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in a final volume of 200 μl. Antibody OKT3 (40 μg/ml) was incubated with paraformaldehyde-fixed DT30 cells (2 × 106/ml), which were used to stimulate Jurkat cells at a ratio of one DT30 cell/10 Jurkat cells. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 8 or 16 h (for cell lines and primary CD4+ T-cells, respectively) and lysed with 1× lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate (pH 7.8), 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). Luciferase activity was determined as follow. After a freeze/thaw cycle, 20 μl of cell extract were transferred to a 96-well luminometer plate, and luciferase activity was monitored on a Dynex MLX microplate luminometer following the addition of 100 μl of luciferase buffer (20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm (MgCO3)4·Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 220 μm CoA, 4.7 μm d-luciferin potassium salt, 530 μm ATP, and 33.3 mm DTT). To assess transfection efficiency in the different transfected samples, the β-galactosidase activity was monitored in the form of triplicates on the luminometer with a Galacto-Light™ commercial kit (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Values from the luminometer are expressed as relative light units. Fold induction was calculated as the ratio of the mean values of the luciferase activity of treated and untreated samples.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts, Probe Labeling, and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to a previously described microscale preparation protocol (41Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3908) Google Scholar). Jurkat or transfected 293T cells were first washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), kept for 15 min on ice, and lysed with 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40. After brief vortexing and centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in hypertonic buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), followed by gentle agitation for 15 min. The solution was then centrifuged, and protein concentration was measured in the supernatant by BCA assay (Pierce) before storage at –85 °C. Radioactive labeling of the oligonucleotides was performed by adding 50 ng of one of the DNA strands in T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and incubating the mixture for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the aqueous phase was spun through a Sephadex G-50 column for further purification. The oligonucleotide was then allowed to hybridize overnight with 200 ng of the complementary strand in annealing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). The sequence of each labeled complete enhancer probe is presented in Table I. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were mixed with poly(dI-dC) (1 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (1 μg/ml), and the labeled oligonucleotide in binding buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 40% glycerol, 10% Ficoll, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, and 250 mm NaCl). This mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then run through a 4% or 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel for 2 h at 150 V. Competition experiments were performed with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the NFAT-binding site of the murine interleukin-2 promoter region (5′-TCGAGCCCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATG-3′). In some experiments, each NF-κB repeat of the clade C enhancer was used as either a probe or unlabeled competition oligonucleotide and identified as follows: repeat I, 5′-CCAGTGGGGCGGTCTAGGAGG-3′; repeat II, 5′-TCCGCTGGGACTTTCCACTGGG-3′; and repeat III, 5′-ACAGAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGG-3′). An additional typical sequence from the extra repeat of clade C was also used in EMSAs: 5′-CCACT-GGGGCGTTCCAGGAGG-3′. Finally, the distal and proximal NF-κB repeats from the NL4-3 clade B enhancer (i.e. 5′-CTACAAGGGACTT-TCCGCTGG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAG-3′, respectively) were also analyzed individually in bandshift experiments. Supershift assays were performed by preincubation of nuclear extracts with 1 μg of antibody in the presence of all the components of the binding reaction described above for 30 min on ice prior to the addition of the labeled probe. Gels were dried and exposed to a Eastman Kodak Biomax MR film at –85 °C.Certain competition experiments were also performed to evaluate band intensity of the specific complexes. Dried gels were thus placed for 16 h in a cassette containing a radioactive-detecting screen, which was then scanned by the Typhoon 9200 imager device. The intensities of the different bands were compared on the same gel using ImageQuant Version 5.2 software. The non-competed band was used as the 100% binding value, and the resulting band intensities for the competed signals were determined"

Histones play an important role in controlling gene expression, and the posttranslational modification of histones plays a role in regulation of intracellular signal transduction. In particular, the amino-terminal tail domain of histone H3 is sensitive to several posttranslational modifications, and acetylation of this domain changes its electrostatic environment and results in the loss of native folding. Therefore, we studied the modification of ϵ-amino groups on human histone H3 by deoxycholyl adenylate, which is an active intermediate in deoxycholyl thioester biosynthesis. After incubation of recombinant human histone H3 with a smaller amount of acyl adenylate, followed by enzymatic digestion, the peptide fragment mixtures were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. These data showed the formation of only one adduct fragment, which corresponded to amino acids 3–8 with a deoxycholate adduct, suggesting that the ϵ-amino group of Lys4 had the highest reactivity. This novel modification, formation of a bile acid adduct on the histone H3 amino-terminal tail domain through an active acyl adenylate, may relate to the carcinogenesis-promoting effects of secondary bile acids.

In eukaryotic cells, the chromatin complex manages diverse intracellular signals and functions as a biological relay point (1Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 2Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D.

Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7467) Google Scholar). The nucleosome, the repeating unit of the chromatin, is formed by ∼200 base pairs of DNA, a histone octamer, which consists of two molecules each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 and histone H1 as a linker (5Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The eight histones in the core are arranged into a (H3)2(H4)2 tetramer and a pair of H2A-H2B heterodimers. The tetramer, in cooperation with the two dimers, forms a left-handed superhelical structure with a diameter of 11 nm, around which ∼146 base pairs of DNA wrap in two turns (5Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Each nucleosome bead is linked with a variable length of linker DNA and a linker histone H1. All of these histones are very basic proteins, and 25% of the amino acid residues are arginine or lysine. In addition, each histone has an amino-terminal tail that extends outward from the core structure. These tails are flexible, contain a greater number of lysine and arginine residues than the core domain, and undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications (1Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 2Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D.

Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7467) Google Scholar). Histone amino-terminal modifications control interaction affinities for chromatin-associated proteins and thereby participate in the transformation of chromatin between transcriptionally active and silent states (4Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7467) Google Scholar). Considering the electrostatic requirements for folding the chromatin polymer, histone amino-terminal modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, can prevent the formation of chromatin fibers. The length of the amino-terminal tail domains varies from 16 to 44 amino acids, and, in particular, the H3 tail domain is necessary for stabilization of the three-dimensional structure of the nucleosomes (6Spencer V.A. Davie J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 240: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). During the S phase of the cell cycle, histones, which are synthesized in the cytoplasm (7Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 8Wiekowski M. Miranda M. Nothias J-Y. DePamphilis M.L. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1147-1158PubMed Google Scholar), must be imported into the nucleus to form nucleosomes on newly replicated DNA. The nuclear import of histones occurs via an active transport mechanism. The core histones are transported by several members of the importin β superfamily, and histone H1 is transported by a heterodimer consisting of importin β and importin 7 (9Baake M. Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Importin β1 has affinity for the nuclear localization sequences of H2A, H3, and H4 (10Johnson-Saliba M. Siddon N.A. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Jans D.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been reported that recognition of histone H3 and H4 by importin β1 differs depending on whether these histones are acetylated (10Johnson-Saliba M. Siddon N.A. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Jans D.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The acetylation of amino-terminal histone tail domains may function to inhibit the nuclear transport of acetylated core histones by masking the nuclear localization sequence, and this may suppress unnecessary signal transductions. Previously, we have reported that bile acid acyl adenylate (Fig. 1), which is formed during activation of the carboxyl group at the C-24 position into the acyl-CoA thioester (11Ikegawa S. Ishikawa H. Oiwa H. Nagata M. Goto J. Kozaki T. Gotowda M. Asakawa N. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), easily reacts with the amino groups on the side chains of lysine residues and at the amino termini of proteins and peptides. Such nonenzymatic reactions result in the production of protein-bile acid adducts (12Goto J. Nagata M. Mano N. Kobayashi N. Ikegawa S. Kiyonami R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Mano N. Nagaya Y. Saito S. Kobayashi N. Goto J. Bicohemistry. 2004; 43: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Bile acids are major cholesterol metabolites, assist in lipolysis and absorption of fats by forming mixed micelles in the intestinal lumen, and are localized in enterohepatic circulation because of their efficient hepatic uptake. During these processes, the epithelial cells lining the colon are exposed to a large quantity of unconjugated bile acids absorbed from the intestine. It has been reported that deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, which are secondary bile acids formed by the action of microbial flora in the colonic environment, may act as colon tumor promoters in high-risk populations (14Narisawa T. Magadia N.E. Weisburger J.H. Wynder E.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1974; 53: 1093-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 15Reddy B.S. Narisawa T. Weisburger J.H. Wynder E.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1976; 56: 441-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In conventional and germ-free rats, both secondary bile acids promote the formation of colonic adenocarcinoma. However, the mechanism of the tumor-promoting activity of secondary bile acids remains to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate the nonenzymatic modification of the histone H3 amino-terminal tail domain by acyl adenylate, a bile acid active intermediate. Reagents and Apparatus—Recombinant human histone H3 and endoproteinase Arg-C were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and Roche Diagnostics, respectively. A matrix for MALDI-TOF 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; DCA, deoxycholic acid; DCA-AMP, deoxycholyl adenylate. MS, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, was supplied by Aldrich. Affi-Gel-10 was purchased from Bio-Rad. Affinity gel immobilized anti-deoxycholate monoclonal antibody (16Kobayashi N. Katayama H. Nagata M. Goto J. Anal. Sci. 2000; 16: 1133-1138Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was prepared according to a previously reported method (13Mano N. Nagaya Y. Saito S. Kobayashi N. Goto J. Bicohemistry. 2004; 43: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A ZipTip C18 cartridge was purchased from Millipore (Milford, MA). Deoxycholyl adenylate (DCA-AMP) was synthesized in our laboratory (11Ikegawa S. Ishikawa H. Oiwa H. Nagata M. Goto J. Kozaki T. Gotowda M. Asakawa N. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Distilled and ion-exchanged water was prepared using a CPW-100 Ultra-pure Water System (Advantec Toyo Co., Tokyo, Japan), and other reagents and solvents were of high performance liquid chromatography grade. MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed using a Voyager DE-STR (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with an N2 laser (337 nm). Nano-electrospray ionization tandem MS analysis was performed using a QSTAR pulser i (Applied Biosystems) combined with a handmade nano-electrospray ionization probe using a metal nanosprayer (GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan). The peptide fragment mixture dissolved in water/methanol/formic acid (4:5:1, v/v/v) was analyzed under infusion mode at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The product ion scan was performed under the following conditions: declustering potential, 60.0 V; collision energy, 25.0–35.0 eV; collision gas, 3 units of N2. Formation of DCA-bound Histone H3 and Immunoaffinity Extraction—DCA-AMP (0.0516, 0.516, 5.16, and 51.6 nmol) was incubated with recombinant histone H3 (5.16 nmol) at 37 °C in 80 μl of 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). 5 m sodium hydroxide solution (1 μl) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to hydrolyze DCA-AMP. After adding 10 μl of water-trifluoroacetic acid (9:1, v/v) solution, the mixture was passed through a column of Sephadex G-25 gel (0.3 ml of gel) to remove salts and low molecular weight compounds such as DCA and DCA-AMP. The fraction (0.125–0.25 ml) containing histone H3 molecules was lyophilized and subjected to digestion with endoproteinase Arg-C (3 μg) in a 1:4 mixture of acetonitrile and 50 mm ammonium carbonate solution containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 8.5 mm CaCl2 (50 μl). The reaction mixture was gently mixed with the immunoaffinity gel immobilized anti-deoxycholate monoclonal antibody in 50 mm ammonium carbonate solution at 4 °C for 16 h. The supernatant was removed by centrifugation, the gel was washed three times with 1 ml of 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.0)-methanol (19:1, v/v) to rinse out nonspecifically adsorbed peptide fragments, and the peptide fragments bound to DCA were eluted with 2 ml of water-methanol (1:1, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After evaporation of the solvent, 10 μl of aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to dissolve the residue, and the mixture was concentrated with a ZipTip C18 cartridge and stored at –20 °C until MS analysis. The acyl adenylate is chemically active and readily soluble in physiological solutions (13Mano N. Nagaya Y. Saito S. Kobayashi N. Goto J. Bicohemistry. 2004; 43: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Recombinant histone H3, which contains 13 lysine residues, was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of DCA-AMP at 4 °C in 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). A peptide fragment mixture, which was obtained by digestion with endoproteinase Arg-C, was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 2A); the peptide fragments detected by MALDI-TOF MS are listed in Table I. Seventeen different peptide peaks were observed on the mass spectra. Furthermore, nine peptide fragments possessed a mass shift of 374, which corresponds to one DCA molecule. Such modified peptides included peptides corresponding not only to the amino-terminal tail domain but also to the core of the histone H3 molecule. Affinity extraction using the anti-deoxycholate monoclonal antibody was quite effective for purification of the peptide-DCA adducts, and all nine peptide fragments modified with DCA could be extracted from the reaction mixture as shown in Fig. 2B.Table IMasses observed in the MALDI-TOF mass spectra as shown in Figs. 2 and 3Fig. 2AFig. 2BFig. 3AFig. 3BBefore immunoaffinity extractionAfter immunoaffinity extractionBefore immunoaffinity extractionAfter immunoaffinity extractionKLPFQR (64-69)1a: 788.46631a′: 788.3878KQLATKAAR (18-26)2a′: 986.5083YRPGTVALR (41-49)3a: 1032.59673a′: 1032.4784TKQTAR (3-8) +DCA4a: 1078.68914b: 1078.63304a′: 1078.56174b′: 1078.8864PGTVALREIR (43-52)5a: 1111.66765a′: 1111.5312KLPFQR (64-69) +DCA6a: 1162.76806b: 1162.7139YQKSTELLIR (54-63)7a: 1250.73437a′: 1250.5771KSTGGKAPR (9-17) +DCA8a: 1275.82168b: 1275.7536EIAQDFKTDLR (73-83)9a: 1335.71539a′: 1335.5410KQLATKAAR (18-26) +DCA10a: 1360.919610b: 1360.8374VTIMPKDIQLAR (117-128)11a: 1384.828311a′: 1384.6396VTIMOXPKDIQLAR (117-128)12a: 1400.826812a′: 1400.6309YRPGTVALREIR (41-52)13a: 1430.853613a′: 1430.6574YQKSTELLIR (54-63) +DCA14a: 1625.031114b: 1624.9503LVREIAQDFKTDLR (70-83)15a′: 1703.7651EIAQDFKTDLR (73-83) +DCA16a: 1710.022716b: 1709.9050VTIMPKDIQLAR (117-128) +DCA17a: 1759.137117b: 1759.0059VTIMOXPKDIQLAR (117-128) +DCA18a: 1775.138118b: 1775.0014KSAPSTGGVKKPHR (27-40) +DCA19a: 1808.180419b: 1808.0507 Open table in a new tab When using equimolar amounts of DCA-AMP and histone H3, the adduct formation phenomenon was considerably different from the results mentioned above. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum obtained from this reaction mixture is illustrated in Fig. 3A. In this case, all but one of the peptides lacked the mass shift corresponding to the DCA molecule. After immunoaffinity extraction, only one peptide peak, which corresponded to a fragment of amino acids 3–8 bound to a DCA molecule, was observed on the mass spectra shown in Fig. 3B. In addition, similar results were obtained when one-tenth or one-hundredth the molar amount of DCA-AMP was incubated with recombinant histone H3 (data not shown). To determine the amino acid sequence of the peptide fragment covalently bound to DCA, it was subjected to nano-electrospray ionization tandem MS analysis using a hybrid quadrupole-time-of-flight mass analyzer. The nomenclature for the fragment ions is based on that proposed by Roepstorff and Fohlman (17Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar), as modified by Biemann (18Biemann K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Three product ion spectra of the DCA-bound amino-terminal tail peptides are shown in Fig. 4, and all tandem MS results are summarized in Table II. As shown in Fig. 4A, the product ion spectrum of doubly charged ions presented doubly charged ions corresponding to molecules that had eliminated either one or two water molecules at m/z 530.8 and 521.8, respectively. Because the same phenomenon was observed in our previous report (13Mano N. Nagaya Y. Saito S. Kobayashi N. Goto J. Bicohemistry. 2004; 43: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), these ions may be produced by elimination of the 3α- and 12α-hydroxyl groups on the steroid nucleus. We observed y5 ions with both a mass shift of 374, corresponding to one DCA molecule, and the elimination of one or two water molecules at m/z 959.6 and 941.6. Clear peaks representing unmodified y1 to y4 ions were also observed. In addition, b2 and b3 ions and their dehydrated ions with mass shifts of 374 were clearly observed at m/z 568.4, 586.4, 604.3, 696.4, and 714.4 as singly charged ions. These results indicate that one DCA molecule was conjugated to the ϵ-amino group of the lysine residue at position 4 of the peptide fragment of amino acids 3–8 (TKQTAR) of histone H3. The product ion spectrum of m/z 638.4 corresponding to the doubly charged ion of the fragment of amino acids 9–17 (KSTGGKAPR) is shown in Fig. 4B. The doubly charged ions corresponding to the dehydrated fragment ions were observed at m/z 620.4 and 629.4. Analysis based on the y ion series (y1, y2, y3, y4, y6, y6-H2O, y6-2H2O, y7, y7-H2O, y7-2H2O, y8, y8-H2O, and y8-2H2O) demonstrated that the modification was at Lys14 because of the mass shift of 502 between y3 and y4. The fragment ions at m/z 471 and 503, which may be produced as an unmodified KAPR and a b1 ion of DCA-bound amino-terminal lysine fragment, respectively, were not observed. This observation, hence, suggests that the lysine residue at the amino terminus was not modified with DCA. The fragment of amino acids 18–26 of histone H3 also had a modification site as shown in Fig. 4C.

The amino-terminal tail domain of histone H3 is sensitive to several posttranslational modifications (4Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7467) Google Scholar), and more than one-third of the amino acid residues in this portion of the protein are lysine or arginine. Modifications of this domain are closely involved in a number of biological events, including silencing, transcription, and mitosis (2Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar, 4Jenuwein T. Allis C.D.

The ϵ-amino groups of lysines 4, 9, 14, and 18, which are in the amino-terminal tail domain of histone H3, are modified by several types of histone acetyltransferase (3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar, 19Kimura A. Horikoshi M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Rice J.C. Allis C.D. Curr.

Cell. 2004; 117: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). N-terminal tail acetylation changes the electrostatic environment of the histone and loosens folding, which results in unstable chromatin structures and increased transcription (22Hansen J.C. Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although hyper-acetylation has caused apoptosis in cancer cells (23Milovic V. Teller I.C. Turchanowa L. Caspary W.F. Stein J. Int. J. Colorectal Dis. 2000; 15: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), such acetylations are reversible by the action of histone deacetylase and subsequent methylation (20Rice J.C. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Histone methyl transferase, which is present in the nucleus (24Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), acts on lysine residues deacetylated by histone deacetylase (20Rice J.C. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), and methylation of lysine 4 relates to activation of transcription (25Boggs B.A. Cheung P. Heard E. Spector D.L. Chinault A.C. Allis C.D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Bile acid acyl adenylate, which is an anhydrous mixed acid consisting of a carboxylic acid and a phosphoric acid, is very chemically active in a physiological environment (11Ikegawa S. Ishikawa H. Oiwa H. Nagata M. Goto J. Kozaki T. Gotowda M. Asakawa N. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and reacts easily with amino groups at the amino termini of protein molecules and on lysine side chains (12Goto J. Nagata M. Mano N. Kobayashi N. Ikegawa S. Kiyonami R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Mano N. Nagaya Y. Saito S. Kobayashi N. Goto J. Bicohemistry. 2004; 43: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the reactivity of the adenylate depends on the pH of the solution and that, in weakly alkaline solutions, the adenylate reacts rapidly with amino groups to produce the corresponding adducts (12Goto J. Nagata M. Mano N. Kobayashi N. Ikegawa S. Kiyonami R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Histone H3 is only slightly soluble in alkaline solution; therefore, the reaction has been carried out under neutral conditions (pH 6.8). When excess amounts of deoxycholyl adenylate were used, many peaks corresponding to peptide fragments bound to deoxycholic acid were observed on the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum. Peptide fragments corresponding to the core domain were detected as both adduct and nonadduct peaks in the mass spectrum obtained without immunoaffinity extraction. In contrast, amino-terminal peptide fragments were predominantly modified with deoxycholate. This may suggest that, because of their flexibility, the ϵ-amino groups in the amino-terminal domain are more exposed to acylation by electrophilic reagents than those in the core domain. The commercially available recombinant histone H3 used in this study was not modified, and its core domain was not wrapped with DNA. A theoretical three-dimensional structure of recombinant histone H3 was constructed using SWISS-MODEL Version 36.0003 (26Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar, 27Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9398) Google Scholar, 28Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which is available at www.expasy.org/swissmod/. This structure may be similar to that of the nucleosome bead as shown in Fig. 5, and the core domain may fold in an α-helical conformation, explaining the difference in reactivity between the core and the amino terminus. The exposure of histone H3 to lower amounts of deoxycholyl adenylate allowed us to clarify the differences in reactivity of each ϵ-amino group in the amino-terminal domain. With the use of equimolar amounts of deoxycholyl adenylate and histone H3 (which corresponds to one-thirteenth the molar amount of lysine residues in histone H3), we only detected one adduct peak on the mass spectrum, and the other fragments were unmodified. After immunoaffinity extraction, a peptide fragment peak corresponding to amino acids 3–8 with a mass shift of 374 was observed. These results suggest that the reactivity of the ϵ-amino group of Lys4 is much higher than the activity of other residues in the amino-terminal and core domains. Secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic and lithocholic acids, are more cytotoxic than the primary bile acids, cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, which are synthesized in hepatocytes. Low doses of primary bile acids increase the number of aberrant crypt foci in the colon (29Sutherland L.A. Bird R.P. Cancer Lett. 1994; 76: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); conversely, higher concentrations of deoxycholic acid induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells (30Martinez J.D. Stratagoules E.D. LaRue J.M. Powell A.A. Gause P.R. Craven M.T. Payne C.M. Powell M.B. Gerner E.W. Earnest D.L. Nutr. Cancer. 1998; 31: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Nair et al. (31Nair P.P. Solomon R. Bankoski J. Plapinger R. Lipids. 1978; 13: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have found a tissue-bound form of lithocholate with a free form in human liver, which can be hydrolytically released using clostridial cholanoylamino acid hydrolase. They have demonstrated a specific conjugation of the ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue to the carboxyl group of a bile acid and investigated the relationship to promotion of carcinogenesis (32Turjman N. Nair P.P. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 3761-3763PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, they have found tissue-bound lithocholate in various commercially available histones (33Nair P.P. Kessie G. Patnaik R. Guidry C. Steroids. 1994; 59: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Secondary bile acids are better substrates for phase II metabolism, including amino acid, sulfuric acid, and glucuronic acid conjugation. As mentioned above, acyl adenylate is an active intermediate in the metabolic reaction that converts carboxylic acid to the corresponding thioester. Rat liver bile acid CoA ligase has been cloned, and it shows affinity for deoxycholate binding (34Falany C.N. Xie X. Wheeler J.B. Wang J. Smith M. He D. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2062-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, acyl-CoA synthetase, also known as ACS-5, which can produce bile acid acyl adenylates as intermediates, has been purified from rat intestinal epithelial cells and proliferating preadipocytes (35Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M-J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, a more recent publication (36Gassler N. Schneider A. Kopitz J. Schnölzer M. Obermüller N. Kartenbeck J. Otto H.F. Autschbach F. Hum. Pathol. 2003; 34: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) has reported the expression of ACS-5 in human epithelial tumors of the small intestine. These findings suggest the possible synthesis of bile acid acyl adenylate in epithelial cells. The formation reaction of acyl adenylate is due to an ATP-dependent ping-pong mechanism (37Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 991-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and acyl adenylate usually does not become soluble in cells. However, when the amount of absorbed bile acids is greater than the amount of CoA, which is required for the transformation from acid adenylate to CoA thioester, it is possible that active acyl adenylates will be released into the periplasm and react with ϵ-amino groups in protein molecules. The addition of butyrate, a short chain fatty acid, inhibits histone deacetylase and results in subsequent histone hyperacetylation, induction of p21WAF overexpression, and apoptotic death in colon cancer cells (23Milovic V.

(40Fabrizi L. Taylor G.W. Cañas B. Boobis A.R. Edwards R.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have reported the adduction of phosgene, the major active metabolite of chloroform, to lysine residues of human histone H2B in their investigation of the mechanism of chloroform mutagenicity. The modification of the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues in the histone H3 amino-terminal domain observed herein may inhibit histone hyperacetylation and result in the promotion of carcinogenesis. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that bile acid acyl adenylate can react with ϵ-amino groups in the histone H3 amino-terminal tail domain under nonenzymatic conditions. These data suggest that the ϵ-amino groups of lysine residues in the amino-terminal domain of histone H3 display higher reactivity than the ϵ-amino groups of lysine residues in the core domain and, in particular, that the ϵ-amino group of Lys4 may have the highest reactivity of any lysine residue in histone H3. This novel modification, bile acid adduct formation on the amino-terminal tail domain of histone H3 through bile acid acyl adenylate as an active intermediate, may also relate to the action of secondary bile acids as colon tumor promoters."

Because they lead to understanding how the oxygen chemistry is coupled to the proton pumping, studies on the O2 reduction mechanism catalyzed by these oxidases have attracted considerable interests. Time-resolved spectroscopic studies have identified a number of intermediates in the reaction of the O2 reduction by bovine CcO (8Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem.

The resulting “oxy” (O) intermediate is rapidly transformed to the so-called “peroxy” (P) species, which has an oxidation state of the heme-copper moiety higher than the Fe3+/Cu2+ state by two oxidative equivalent. Although the peroxy intermediate had been expected to have an intact O-O bond (11Vygodina T.V. Konstantinov A.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The O-O bond scission in the O-to-P transition raised the question about the source of an additional oxidative equivalent. Cleavage of the iron-bound O-O bond requires four electrons. Three of them are provided by the binuclear center [FeII/CuI → FeIV/CuII], but the source of the fourth electron remains to be solved. Because of the formation of a porphyrin π-cation radical, oxidation of the heme macrocycle can provide one electron, as in horseradish peroxidase compound I. However, resonance Raman and optical absorption spectra eliminate this possibility (14Proshlyakov D.A. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T.

Tyr-288 (if not stated otherwise, we adopt here the residue numbering of cytochrome bo) is highly conserved in the SoxM-type oxidases and is a potential candidate for such protein-based electron donors at the distal side of heme a3 (or o). Tyr-288 is also involved in the uptake of protons through the K channel during the initial reduction of the binuclear center. Crystallographic (27Ostermeier C. Harrenga A. Ermler U. Michel H. Proc.

Consequently, Tyr-288 could provide hydrogen to the iron-bound O-O, which leads to rapid cleavage of the bond with the concomitant formation of a tyrosine neutral radical. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies on the reaction of H2O2 with the oxidized enzyme revealed an electron paramagnetic resonance signal with partially resolved hyperfine structure ascribable to a tyrosine radical (17Fabian M.

Recent attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared study on bovine CcO revealed strong negative bands at 1313 and 1547 cm-1 and a positive band at ∼1519 cm-1 in the PM intermediate (42Iwaki M. Puustinen A. Wikstrom M. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8809-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the cross-linked Tyr facilitates the cleavage of the O-O bond during P formation. To explore the role of the Tyr-His covalent bond, we prepared three stable isotope-labeled enzymes. We constructed a Tyr auxotrophic strain harboring an overexpression vector for cytochrome bo and grew it in a synthetic medium supplemented with l-d4-Tyr, l-1-[13C]Tyr, or l-4-[13C]Tyr as a sole l-Tyr source. Unexpectedly, the d4-Tyr-labeled enzyme showed a reduction in the ubiquinol-1 oxidase and CO binding activities. Optical absorption and resonance Raman (RR) spectra identified the defect in the distal side of the heme-copper binuclear center. Our results suggest that the substitution of ring hydrogens of Tyr-288 with deuteriums slows down the formation of the His-Tyr cross-link essential for dioxygen reduction at the binuclear center. A possible self-catalyzed mechanism for the formation of the His-Tyr bond is discussed. Materials—l-d4- and l-4-13C-labeled Tyr (98 and 99 atom%, respectively) were purchased from ICON Services Inc. (Summit, NJ), and l-1-[13C]Tyr (99 atom%) was from MassTrace Inc. (Woburn, MA). Bacterial Strains—E. coli strains GO103/pHN3795–1 (cyo+ Δcyd/cyo+), ST4533/pHN3795-H333A (Δcyo cyd+/cyo-) (43Mogi T. Hirano T. Nakamura H. Anraku Y. Orii Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and ST4676/pMFO9-Y288F (Δcyo cyd+/cyo-) (44Kawasaki M. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were used for isolation of the wild type cytochrome bo and H333A and Y288F mutant oxidases, respectively. The tyrosine auxotroph, GO103Y, was constructed as follows. The ΔtyrA16::Tn10 locus was transduced into GO103 by P1 phage grown on strain N3087 (CGSC 6662). A transductant was verified by Tetr and Tyr- phenotypes and transformed with pHN3795–1 to give GO103Y/pHN3795–1. Purification of Unlabeled Cytochrome bo—E. coli cells were grown in 1.5× minimal medium A (45Davis B.D. Mingioloi E.S. J. Bacteriol. 1959; 60: 17-28Crossref Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% Bacto tryptone, 0.5% Bacto casamino acid, 0.5% Bacto yeast extract, 1% glycerol, 100 μg/ml sodium ampicillin, 50 μg/ml l-Trp, 50 μg/ml FeSO4·7H2O, and 25 μg/ml CuSO4·4H2O (IM-metal-glycerol medium). Cytochrome bo was solubilized from isolated cytoplasmic membranes with sucrose monolaurate (Mitsubishi-Kagaku Foods Co., Tokyo) and purified by anion-exchange HPLC as described previously (46Tsubaki M. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Hori H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6065-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Purified enzymes were stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% sucrose monolaurate at -80 °C until use. The concentration of the enzymes was determined by the pyridine ferrohemochromogen method using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 20.7 for heme B, assuming that the enzyme has two hemes. Reduced forms were prepared by adding a slight excess of freshly prepared anaerobic dithionite solution under argon atmosphere into the degassed enzyme solution. CO-bound forms were prepared by introducing gaseous CO into the reduced samples. Isotopic Labeling of Wild Type Enzyme—To incorporate specifically isotope-labeled Tyr into cytochrome bo, GO103Y/pHN3795–1 was grown in a modified minimal medium A supplemented with 20 amino acids. The 10-liter medium contained1gof isotope-labeled l-Tyr and 19 unlabeled l-amino acids (5.6 g of Ala, 6.6 g of Arg, 1.4 g of Asn, 12 g of Asp, 5.2 g of Cys-HCl, 2.4 g of Gln, 40 g of Glu, 3.4 g of Gly, 5.4 g of His, 10.0 g of Ile, 17.8 g of Leu, 18.4 g of Lys-HCl, 5.4 g of Met, 9.0 g of Phe, 20.6 g of Pro, 10.0 g of Ser, 7.4 g of Thr, 4.0 g of Trp, 12.4 g of Val) (47Kainosho M. Tsuji T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6273-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), as well as 5.0 g of adenine, 2.0 g of cytosine, 6.5 g of guanosine, 2.0 g of thymine, 5.0 g of uracil, 15.0 g of sodium acetate, 15.0 g of sodium succinate, 104 g of K2HPO4,30gofKH2PO4, 7.5 g of sodium citrate, and 25.0 g of (NH4)2SO4. After autoclaving, the following solutions were added after filter sterilization: 400 ml of 50% glucose, 100 ml of vitamin mixture containing thiamine-HCl (0.50 g), niacin (0.50 g), biotin (0.01 g) (48Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 44-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and sodium ampicillin (1.0 g), 10 ml of metal mixture A containing FeCl3·6H2O (0.25 g) and CaCl2·2H2O (0.04 g), and 100 ml of metal mixture B containing MgSO4·7H2O (10 g), CuSO4·5H2O (0.125 g), ZnSO4·7H2O (0.04 g), and MnSO4·5H2O (0.04 g). During cell growth, 10 N NaOH was added to maintain the pH between 7.2 and 7.5. Isotopically labeled enzymes were purified by anion-exchange HPLC (46Tsubaki M. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Hori H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6065-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and their yields were ∼0.4 μmol from the 10-liter culture. Resonance Raman Measurements—RR spectra were obtained with a single polychromator (DG-1000; Ritsu Oyo Kogaku) equipped with a liquid N2-cooled CCD detector (CCD-1340/400-EB; Princeton Instruments). The excitation wavelength used was 413.1 nm from a Kr ion laser (BeamLok 2060; Spectra Physics) for the air-oxidized, reduced, and CO-bound forms. The laser power at the sample point was adjusted to 1.2 mW for the reduced form and to 0.05–0.1 mW for the air-oxidized and CO-bound forms to prevent photoreduction and photodissociation, respectively. Raman shifts were calibrated with indene, CCl4, and aqueous solution of ferrocyanide, and the accuracy of the peak positions of the well defined Raman bands was ± 1 cm-1. All measurements were performed at room temperature with a spinning cell. The enzyme concentration for RR experiments was 50 μm heme in the 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 0.1% sucrose monolaurate. To measure absorption and RR spectra of the fully oxidized Y288F, the air-oxidized form, where hemes are partly reduced (49Das T.K. Tomson F.L. Gennis R.B. Gordon M. Rousseau D.L. Biophys.

Metal Content Analysis—The purified oxidase solutions (0.2–1 mm) were diluted to 0.5–1 μm by Nanopure water (18.3 mΩ purity; Barnstead), and copper and iron contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy at Shimadzu Analysis Center. Each analysis was complemented by appropriate control experiments. Miscellaneous—Optical absorption spectra of purified oxidases (∼5 μm heme) were recorded on a Hitachi UV-3200 UV/Vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. The samples were sealed inside a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Heme contents of the oxidases were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC after extraction with acid acetone as described previously (51Saiki K. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Ubiquinol-1 oxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically with a millimolar extinction coefficient of 13.25 at 275 nm at 0.5 mm ubiquinol-1 (3Sato-Watanabe M. Mogi T. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. Miyoshi H. Iwamura H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28908-28912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of Isotope Labeling of Tyrosines on Quinol Oxidase Activity and Metal Contents—Three different isotope-labeled tyrosines were biosynthetically incorporated into the wild type cytochrome bo in the Tyr auxotroph: 1) l-1-[13C]Tyr with a 13C atom at the main chain carbonyl, 2) l-4-[13C]Tyr with a 13C atom bound to the phenolic oxygen, and 3) l-d4-Tyr where all ring hydrogens are deuterated (Fig. 1). In the enzymes, all tyrosines are isotopically labeled. Ubiquinol-1 oxidase activity and metal contents are summarized in Table I. Those of 1-[13C]Tyr and 4-[13C]Tyr-labeled wild type enzyme (1-[13C]Tyr-WT and 4-[13C]Tyr-WT, respectively) were comparable with those of unlabeled wild type enzyme (12C WT). The elimination of one of the three His ligands of CuB in the H333A mutant and removal of a phenolic hydroxyl group at position 288 in the Y288F and Y288L mutants resulted in a complete loss of oxidase activity (Table I) as reported previously (43Mogi T.

In Y288F, the loss of ubiquinol oxidase activity was accompanied by the replacement of heme o with heme b at the binuclear center and a partial loss of the CO binding activity (44Kawasaki M. Mogi T.

Labeling of cytochrome bo with l-d4-Tyr appears to affect the structural environment at the heme o-CuB binuclear center. Because d4-Tyr-WT normally contains all three redox metal centers as in [12C]Tyr-WT, 1-[13C]Tyr-WT, and 4-[13C]Tyr-WT (Table I), effects of the d4-Tyr labeling on the oxidase activity must be different from those of the Y288F and H333A mutations. Accordingly, effects of the d4-Tyr labeling on the binuclear center were examined by optical and resonance Raman spectroscopy. Effects of Isotope Labeling of Tyrosines on Optical Absorption Spectra of Cytochrome bo—Optical absorption maxima of 1-[13C] Tyr-WT and 4-[13C]Tyr-WT in the air-oxidized, dithionite-reduced, and reduced CO-bound states are summarized in Table II. They are similar to those of 12C WT with the Soret peak at 409, 428, and 418 nm, respectively. The Soret maxima of the CO-bound form of d4-Tyr-WT was shifted to 426 nm from 418 nm of 12C WT (Table II) because of significant contribution from the unbound form (428 nm), which results from the low CO binding activity of heme o (Table I) as found for the heme bb-type Y288F mutant. However, a peak (i.e. heme o2+-CO) and trough (heme o2+) in the Soret region of the reduced CO-bound minus reduced difference spectrum of d4-Tyr-WT are identical to those of [12C]Tyr-WT, 1-[13C]Tyr-WT, 4-[13C]Tyr-WT, and H333A as shown in Fig. 2. In contrast, peaks at 415.5, 532, and 567 nm and troughs at 430 and 551 nm of 12C WT are shifted to 419.5, 543, and 577 nm and 431.5 and 561 nm, respectively, for the Y288F mutant.Table IIAbsorption maxima of the absolute optical spectra at room temperature for unlabeled and Tyr isotope-labeled WTs and H333A and Y288F mutants of cytochrome boOxidasesAir-oxidizedReducedCO-bound12C WT409.5, 531428, 532, 562418, 532, 5641-[13C]Tyr-WT408, 529427.5, 531.5, 561.5418.5, 532, 5634-[13C]Tyr-WT408,532428, 531.5, 561418.5, 532, 563d4-Tyr-WT408, 532428, 531.5, 561.5426.5, 532, 562.5Y288F414, 532.5428, 531, 562426, 532, 562.5H333A409, 534428, 532, 561.5419, 532, 563 Open table in a new tab Effects of Isotope Labeling of Tyrosines on Resonance Raman Spectra in the High Frequency Region—To gain further insight into the molecular structure of the heme-copper binuclear center, we have employed RR spectroscopy. The 413.1-nm excited RR spectra of the air-oxidized, reduced, and CO-bound forms are shown in Fig. 3, A, B, and C, respectively. It is well known that bands in the high frequency region can be used as sensitive markers of the oxidation state (ν4) and spin and coordination states (ν2 and ν3) of the heme iron (56Spiro T.G. Li X.-Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. III. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 1-37Google Scholar). In the air-oxidized states, all the Tyr-labeled WT and H333A mutant enzymes showed almost similar RR spectra to that of the unlabeled 12C WT enzyme (Fig. 3A). The ν4 band of all the preparations was observed at 1371 cm-1 with a shoulder at 1361 cm-1. The shoulder intensity becomes relatively stronger upon increase of laser power and, therefore, is attributed to the photoreduced species (data not shown). Typically, 5-coordinate high spin, 6-coordinate high spin, and 6-coordinate low spin hemes give the ν3 band at 1490–1500, 1475–1485, and 1500–1510 cm-1, respectively (57Spiro T.G. Stong J.D. Stein P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2648-2655Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ν3 bands observed at 1477 and 1505 cm-1 for 12C WT, Tyr-labeled WT, and H333A mutant are assignable to high spin heme o and low spin heme b, respectively. d4-Tyr-WT exhibited no specific features compared with 12C WT. In the heme bb-type Y288F mutant, a high spin heme b at the binuclear center was partly photoreduced and gave the ν4 and ν3 bands at 1361 and 1492 cm-1 at the expense of the 1371- and 1477-cm-1 bands. For the dithionite-reduced 12C WT, Tyr-labeled WT, and H333A mutant, the ν3 bands observed at 1472 and 1492 cm-1 were assigned to 5-coordinate high spin heme o and 6-coordinate low spin heme b, respectively (Fig. 3B). Again, there are no specific features in d4-Tyr-WT. In the reduced Y288F mutant, the 1472-cm-1 band disappeared and only the 1492-cm-1 band was observed, which coincides with the conversion of heme bo-type to heme bb-type oxidase (Table I). When CO was added to the dithionite-reduced state, a new ν4 band appeared at 1371 cm-1 for [12C]Tyr-WT, 1-[13C]Tyr-WT, and 4-[13C]Tyr-WT enzymes, suggesting that CO binds to high spin heme o (Fig. 3C). The presence of the ν3 band at 1504 cm-1 supports this assignment. For d4-Tyr-WT, on the other hand, ν4 and ν3 appeared at 1361 and 1493 cm-1, respectively, which were distinct from 12C WT but close to the H333A mutant. This would suggest the formation of an amino acid-bound 6-coordinate low spin state in heme o similar to the heme b moiety. In the case of the Y288"

Here, we demonstrate that amlodipine (10(-6) to 10(-8) M) activates de novo synthesis of p21(Waf1/Cip1) in vitro. We show that amlodipine-dependent activation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) involves the action of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and C/EBP-alpha. The underlying pathway apparently involves the action of mitogen-activated protein kinase or protein kinase C, but not of extracellular signal-related kinase or changes of intracellular calcium. Amlodipine-induced p21(Waf1/Cip1) promoter activity and expression were abrogated by C/EBP-alpha antisense oligonucleotide or by the GR antagonist RU486. Amlodipine-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation was partially reversed by RU486 at 10(-8) M (58%+/-29%), antisense oligonucleotides targeting C/EBP-alpha (91%+/-26%), or antisense mRNAs targeting p21(Waf1/Cip1) (96%+/-32%, n=6); scrambled antisense oligonucleotides or those directed against C/EBP-beta were ineffective. The data suggest that the anti-proliferative action of amlodipine is achieved by induction of the p21 (Waf1/Cip1) gene, which may explain beneficial covert effects of this widely used cardiovascular therapeutic drug beyond a more limited role as a vascular relaxant."
https://openalex.org/W1982306279,"DNA displacement synthesis by reverse transcriptase during retroviral replication is required for the production of the linear precursor to integration. The sensitivity of unpaired thymines to KMnO4 oxidation was used to probe for the extent of DNA melting by human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase in front of the primer terminus in model oligonucleotide-based displacement constructs. Unpairing of the two base pairs downstream of the primer (+1 and +2 positions) requires the presence of the next correct dNTP, indicating that DNA melting only occurs after the formation of the ternary complex with the enzyme tightly clamped around the DNA. The amount or extent of DNA melting is not significantly affected by the length of the already-displaced strand or the base composition of the DNA beyond the +2 position. The F61W mutant form of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, which is partially impaired for displacement synthesis, exhibits a reduction in the amount of melting at the +1 and +2 positions. These results demonstrate the importance of the observed melting to displacement synthesis and suggest that the unpairing reaction is mediated by an intimate association between the fingers region of the enzyme and the DNA in the closed clamp conformation of the protein.

HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type. reverse transcriptase is a multifunctional enzyme with a polymerase domain that catalyzes both RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis and an RNase H domain that catalyzes degradation of RNA when it is hybridized to DNA (for reviews, see Refs. 1Varmus H.

Biol. 1998; 58: 339-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Viral reverse transcription is initiated from a specific tRNA primer that anneals near the 5′-end of the plus-sense RNA genome at the primer binding site. Extension of the tRNA primer followed by the first strand transfer allows the completion of the minus DNA strand and generates the substrate for the RNase H cleavage that creates the plus-strand primer at the polypurine tract. Removal of the tRNA allows a second strand transfer that occurs via complementary primer binding site regions at the 3′-ends of both plus and minus strands. Completion of both plus and minus strands to produce the long terminal repeat-flanked linear product required for integration is believed to occur through a circular intermediate in which reverse transcriptase must carry out strand displacement synthesis through a stretch of DNA ∼600 bp in length (3Gilboa E.

HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is a heterodimer, consisting of 66- and 51-kDa subunits that share the same N terminus. Proteolytic cleavage of the p66 subunit, which removes the C-terminal RNase H domain, produces the smaller p51 subunit. Both the p66/p51 heterodimer and the p66 homodimer are capable of carrying out displacement synthesis (5Huber H.E. McCoy J.M. Seehra J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

However, no crystal structure has yet been published of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase complexed with a primer/template/non-template strand that would reveal the relationship between the polymerase and the non-template strand during displacement synthesis. Structural studies have led to the development of models for primer/template binding involving both a template grip and a primer grip (15Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A.

Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses have supported the concept of an ordered polymerization mechanism with a conformational change accompanying primer/template binding, followed by an additional conformational change associated with dNTP binding that leads to a productive complex (21Patel P.H.

Biol. 1999; 292: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Importantly, this latter conformational change that results in the formation of the ternary complex involving the enzyme, primer/template, and dNTP shifts the fingers domain closer to the palm to more tightly wrap the enzyme around the DNA (20Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the structure of this ternary complex reveals that the three unpaired template residues ahead of the primer terminus are folded back away from the DNA axis and interact with the fingers domain. A cocrystal structure showing DNA bound to an N-terminal fragment of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase similarly implicates residues in the fingers sub-domain in template binding (26Najmudin S. Cote M.L. Sun D. Yohannan S. Montano S.P. Gu J. Georgiadis M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 613-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, amino acid changes at position 61 within the fingers domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase have revealed a role for this residue in both template binding and displacement synthesis (27Fisher T.S. Darden T. Prasad V.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 443-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whereas changing Phe61 to tyrosine or leucine increased the efficiency of displacement synthesis with some loss in processivity, a change to tryptophan at this position was shown to significantly reduce the displacement capability of the polymerase without affecting processivity. Model building based on the crystal structure of the enzyme with a bound dNTP (20Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) suggests that an interaction between Phe61 and the template base two nucleotides in front of the primer terminus (referred to as the +2 position) is involved in destabilizing the helix at this position and thereby promoting displacement synthesis. We have shown previously that reverse transcriptases are capable of DNA displacement synthesis through several hundred base pairs at a rate ∼4-fold slower than that of non-displacement synthesis (4Whiting S.H. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4747-4758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Whiting S.H. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Kelleher C.D. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9976-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, based on the similar effects of temperature on non-displacement and displacement synthesis, it seems likely that displacement synthesis occurs by an active mechanism as opposed to a strictly passive process dependent on breathing of the helix in advance of the primer terminus (6Whiting S.H. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, a strict helicase-like mechanism (28Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2269-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) would appear to be ruled out by the finding that the polymerase is unable to melt the DNA helix in the presence of either ATP or dNTPs under conditions where extension is prevented (4Whiting S.H. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4747-4758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, strand separation ahead of the advancing polymerase in the displacement mode could either be facilitated directly by protein-nucleic acid interactions and/or coupled to the translocation of the polymerase with each nucleotide added. Consistent with either of these possibilities is the observation based on DNase I footprinting results that the enzyme contacts the DNA 7 and 9 nucleotides downstream of the primer terminus in the template and non-template strands, respectively (29Wohrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Winshell J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Further support for an active mechanism involving direct contacts between the enzyme and the duplex region ahead of the primer terminus comes from our use of KMnO4 sensitivity to show that the two base pairs in front of the polymerase are unpaired in a temperature-independent fashion in model displacement constructs (30Winshell J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we describe additional studies using KMnO4 oxidation as a probe for unpaired thymine residues to investigate the nature of the protein-DNA interactions responsible for unpairing the duplex in front of the primer terminus during displacement synthesis. We show that the unpairing reaction requires the cognate dNTP, but is independent of the length of the already-displaced DNA flap. Furthermore, the length of the unpaired region is not influenced by the base composition of the DNA beyond the +2 position. Finally, we show that replacing Phe61 with tryptophan, which results in a diminished capacity to carry out displacement synthesis (27Fisher T.S. Darden T. Prasad V.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 443-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), results in a reduced melting of the DNA at the +1 and +2 positions.

T4 polynucleotide kinase (10,000 units/ml) and bovine serum albumin were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. Denaturing polyacrylamide gels (8.3 m urea) were made with Sequagel Sequencing System reagents purchased from National Diagnostics. The 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bis) were prepared in a high ionic strength buffer containing 0.16 m glycine, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5.

Escherichia coli strains containing plasmids coding for the WT and the F61W mutant forms of p66 and a His-tagged form of p51 were kindly provided by Dr. V. Prasad (27Fisher T.S. Darden T. Prasad V.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 443-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To purify the heterodimeric HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, bacteria expressing p66 or p51 were separately grown to mid-log phase, and after induction and further growth, the bacterial cell pellets were collected and mixed. After lysis of the cells, the mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C prior to purification of the heterodimeric proteins as described by Fisher et al. (27Fisher T.S. Darden T. Prasad V.R. J. Mol.

The specific activities of the purified WT and F61W reverse transcriptases were determined by the poly(rA):oligo(dT) assay as described previously (31Hou E.W. Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 34: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using WT HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (21.6 units/μg) as an activity standard. One unit of activity incorporates 1 nmol of labeled dTMP in 20 min at 37°C using poly(rA): oligo(dT) as the template primer. The specific activities of the purified WT and F61W reverse transcriptases were 9.1 and 5.2 units/μg, respectively. Oligonucleotides and Preparation of Displacement Constructs— Mlv13dideoxy was purchased from Sigma Genosys, and non-temp3moreTs and temp3moreTs were purchased from Operon. All other oligonucleotides (mlv13primer, non-temp3, temp3, non-temp4, temp4, non-temp3T2, temp3T2, non-temp3-gap2, non-temp3-gap1, non-temp3-OH1, non-temp3-OH3 and non-temp3-OH6) were purchased from Invitrogen. All oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing PAGE. The names, lengths, and sequences of the DNA oligonucleotides are as follows: mlv13 primer (30-mer, 5′-CAGGGGTCTCCCGATCCC-GGACGAGCCCCC-3′), mlv13dideoxy (30-mer, 5′-CAGGGGTCTCCCG-ATCCCGGACGAGCCCC(ddC)-3′), non-temp3 (41-mer, 5′-CCAGTAA-TGTGTACGTGAGTCGTGCTTGACTGGATCCCGAG-3′), temp3 (59-mer, 5′-CGGGATCCAGTCAAGCACGACTCACGTGGGGGCTCGTCC-GGGATCGGGAGACCCCTGGA-3′), non-temp4 (40-mer, 5′-CCAGTAA-TGTGTTGCACTCAGCACGAACTGACCTAGGCAG-3′), temp4 (58-mer, 5′-GCCTAGGTCAGTTCGTGCTGAGTGCAGGGGGCTCGTCCG-GGATCGGGAGACCCCTGGA-3′), non-temp3T2 (41-mer, 5′-CCAGTA-ATGTGTGTCAGAGTCGTGCTTGACTGGATCCCGAG-3′), temp3T2 (59-mer, 5′-CGGGATCCAGTCAAGCACGACTCTGACGGGGGCTCGT-CCGGGATCGGGAGACCCCTGGA-3′), non-temp3moreTs (41-mer, 5′-CCAGTAATGTGTACGTGTTTCGTGCTTGACTGGATCCCGAG-3′), temp3moreTs (59-mer, 5′-CGGGATCCAGTCAAGCACGAAACACGTG-GGGGCTCGTCCGGGATCGGGAGACCCCTGGA-3′), non-temp3-gap2 (27-mer, 5′-GTGAGTCGTGCTTGACTGGATCCCGAG-3′), non-temp3-gap1 (28-mer, 5′-CGTGAGTCGTGCTTGACTGGATCCCGAG-3′), non-temp3-OH1 (30-mer, 5′-TACGTGAGTCGTGCTTGACTGGATCCCGA-G-3′), non-temp3-OH3 (32-mer, 5′-TGTACGTGAGTCGTGCTTGACTG-GATCCCGAG-3′), and non-temp3-OH6 (35-mer, 5′-ATGTGTACGTGA-GTCGTGCTTGACTGGATCCCGAG-3′). Where indicated, 10 pmol of the oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with equimolar [γ-32P]ATP and 10 units of polynucleotide kinase for 45 min at 37 °C in the reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The reactions were terminated by chelating the Mg2+ with EDTA and heating the reaction to 65 °C for 10 min. DNA displacement constructs were prepared as follows: 5′-32P-end-labeled non-template/template/primer DNAs were annealed in a 1:2:3 molar ratio in 1.5× RT buffer using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermocycler programmed as follows: 1 min at 95 °C, 10 min ramp to 70 °C, hold 30 min at 70 °C, 10 min ramp to 33 °C, hold 30 min at 33 °C, cool and hold at 4 °C. DTT was then added to a final reaction concentration of 5 mm. Annealing for primer extension assays was performed as described above except that the molar ratio was 1:2:3 for the 5′-32P-end-labeled primer/template/non-template DNAs. To confirm that the labeled oligonucleotide was completely annealed and that no single-strands persisted that could contribute to the KMnO4 cleavage pattern, the complexes were routinely analyzed by electrophoresis through non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C, as described previously (30Winshell J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thermostability calculations employing the thermodynamic parameters of Sugimoto et al. (32Sugimoto N. Nakano S. Yoneyama M. Honda K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4501-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) indicated that the region of non-template strand downstream from the primer terminus would remain stably annealed at 37 °C even when the reverse transcriptase had extended to the 3′-most position required by the experiments. Use of KMnO4 as a Probe for Unpaired Nucleotides in Front of the Primer Terminus on Displacement Templates—Displacement reactions (final volume, 28 μl) containing 10 nm 5′-32P-end-labeled non-template strand annealed as described above were preincubated with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (40 nm final concentration) in 1× RT buffer containing 5 mm DTT at 37 °C for 1 min. Control reactions were incubated with enzyme in the absence of dNTPs. Displacement synthesis was initiated by the addition of dNTPs and/or ddNTPs (final concentration, 200 μm each) as indicated in figure legends. Constructs employing dideoxy-terminated primer were initiated in an identical manner. After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, a 10-μl portion of each reaction was removed and combined with 2.5 μl of 50% glycerol. These samples were held on ice for ∼10 min before being electrophoresed through a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C as previously described (30Winshell J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to confirm that all of the labeled DNA was bound to the enzyme (not shown). To the remaining 18 μl of each reaction was added 2 μl of freshly made 200 mm KMnO4 (final concentration, 20 mm) followed by an incubation at room temperature for 2.5 min. The oxidation reaction was quenched with 2 μl of 14.4 m 2-mercaptoethanol. 180 μl of HZ stop solution was added, and the samples were ethanol-precipitated twice, resuspended in 100 μl of 1 m piperidine and incubated at 90 °C for 30 min. To decrease background smearing in the gel caused by residual piperidine, samples were lyophilized to dryness after resuspension in 50 μl of H2O, three times. The final dried samples were resuspended in 10 μl of 98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA containing a trace amount of xylene cyanol. Before loading on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel, samples were heated at 65 °C for 1 min. Gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and analyzed using ImageQuant software. The same sensitivity and background parameters were used for an entire gel image. Each lane on a gel was analyzed separately, calculating the percentage of the total signal in the lane represented by each detectable band. Comparisons were made between lanes based on these calculations. Time Course Extension Assays with Non-displacement and Displacement Constructs—The procedures and DNA oligonucleotides for carrying out extension assays have been described previously (6Whiting S.H. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly a single-stranded template DNA from recombinant M13 phagemid pB-SMOLTR(+) DNA was isolated and linearized. For the displacement synthesis assays, oligonucleotide MLVU5I was annealed to the template and extended to the 5′-end of the template using Sequenase. For both non-displacement and displacement synthesis, extension was initiated from 5′-32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide MLVPBSII under standard reaction conditions (20-μl final volume) using 5 units of either WT or F61W reverse transcriptase. Control reactions with T4 DNA polymerase, which is capable of only very limited displacement synthesis, were used to verify the structure of the displacement template. Extension products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel alongside size markers prepared as described previously (6Whiting S.H. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Gels were analyzed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Displacement Constructs—The displacement constructs used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The basic displacement construct (I) is formed by annealing a 30-mer primer (mlv13primer), a 59-mer template strand (temp3), and a 41-mer non-template strand (non-temp3). The non-template strand contains a single-stranded flap (12 bases) at its 5′-end to simulate a displacement intermediate, but the sequence of the flap region is different from the sequence at the 3′-end of the primer to prevent branch migration. Each end of the construct has a two-base 3′ overhang to prevent recognition of the 3′-ends as primer termini by reverse transcriptase. This construct was designed so that incorporation of different chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides would arrest movement of reverse transcriptase and position the primer terminus at a fixed distance from thymine residues in the downstream non-template strand. Because unpaired thymine bases are sensitive to KMnO4 oxidation, this experimental design allowed us to test for DNA melting by the polymerase at positions downstream of the primer terminus. In control primer-extension experiments with 5′-end-labeled mlv13primer, synthesis was found to proceed to the end of the template in the presence of all four dNTPs, whereas extension reactions carried out in the presence of chain-terminating ddNTPs produced fragments with the predicted lengths (data not shown) (30Winshell J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Variations on this basic construct were designed to examine the influence of synthesis, flap length, and sequence context on melting of the non-template strand downstream from the primer terminus. The mlv13dideoxy oligonucleotide used in constructs II and III was synthesized with a 2′,3′-dideoxynucleotide at its 3′-end to prevent extension while allowing for the formation of a ternary complex (reverse transcriptase, primer/template/non-template, and dNTP) and was confirmed to be unextendable by a standard primer extension assay (data not shown). Construct IV was designed to examine the effects of sequence context on the extent of melting by including a stretch of three consecutive thymines in the region downstream from the primer terminus. Construct V (see Fig. 4) was identical to the basic displacement construct except for variations in the length of the single-stranded non-template strand flaps. Effect of Next Correct Nucleotide on DNA Melting at +1 and +2 Positions—KMnO4 oxidation of thymine residues in regions of single-stranded DNA, followed by alkaline cleavage of the modified residues generates 5′-phosphate-terminated oligonucleotide fragments (33Hayatsu H.

Koch T. Orum H. Schuster G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3940-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using model displacement constructs built from oligonucleotides containing thymine residues at various distances from the primer terminus in both the template and non-template strands, we previously used this property of unpaired thymines to show that the +1 and +2 base pairs are melted by reverse transcriptase (30Winshell J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, these assays were carried out in the presence of three dNTPs plus a ddNTP, so it is likely that the nucleotide binding pocket was occupied by the next correct dNTP in every case. Here we systematically investigate whether the next correct dNTP is required for the observed melting and by extension whether the melting is dependent on the protein conformational change that accompanies dNTP binding (20Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was incubated with displacement construct I containing a 5′-32P-end-labeled non-template strand under conditions of saturating enzyme (data not shown, see Ref. 30Winshell J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Incubation in the presence of ddGTP plus dATP and dCTP arrested synthesis at the point where thymine 16 in the non-template strand is at position +1, whereas extension in the presence of ddCTP and dATP placed the same thymine residue at position +2.
