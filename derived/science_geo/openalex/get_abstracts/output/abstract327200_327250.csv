https://openalex.org/W1977075282,"Very extensive bleaching of coral reef communities occurred after severe flood rains over eastern Jamaica. The loss of color was due to the mass expulsion of zooxanthellae from the tissues of Millepora, Scleractinia, Zoanthidea, and Actiniaria living in the shallow reef zones. The polyps of the bleached individuals continued to expand and feed in their normal fashion. It is believed that expulsion of the zooxanthellae was induced by contact with water of lowered osmotic pressure on the surface of the sea, rather than by sedimentation or fouling. Regeneration of the depleted zooxanthellar populations was very slow; many of the bleached colonies survived well despite the near total absence of zooxanthellae from their tissues for over 2 months."

In two cases, these correspond to the crossing of the optical major axis by spiral arms. A spur of emission extends southeast from the galaxy near the minor axis."
https://openalex.org/W2053295738,Heat of solution of silica in soil saturation pastes was calculated from silica solubilities and agreed with values for solid silicic acid. The immediate source of silica in soil solutions apparently is solid silicic acid. The solution of silica from soils exhibited three stages of constant silica solubility.

https://openalex.org/W2026534375,"Rotational streaming of cytoplasm occurs in the form of longicellular currents in immature and relatively mature fibers of bean stems. Plastids carried by these currents move continuously on their rotational course from one end of the cell to the other in relatively straight lines. A distance of approximately 2 millimeters, the average length of the fibers, is covered in about 3 minutes (3.6 cm per hour). The same type of streaming occurs in immature phloem fibers that develop within 24 hours after bean seeds are planted and before the plants appear above the soil surface. Rotational streaming also occurs in xylem fibers of bean stems and in cells which appear to be fibers in stems of young cucumber, tomato, sunflower, and flax."

https://openalex.org/W2064931570,"We agree with Caldeira that the
mechanism we proposed (1) to account for
large decreases in the C isotopic composition
of surface sea water during Neoproterozoic
and Permo-Triassic can work only if
the negative excursions lasted for less than
10^6 years. It is likely that the Permo-Triassic
boundary excursion persisted no longer
than the 10^5-year time scale permitted in
Kump's model (2). At the proposed Permo-
Triassic boundary stratotype at Meishan,
China, the stratigraphic interval containing
the excursion is 1 meter thick (3); an earlier
negative excursion described by Jin (4)
from a Capitanian-Wujiapingian boundary
section in southwestern China is confined to a comparably thin stratigraphic interval.
For the one Neoproterozoic negative excursion
closely constrained by radiometric
data, uranium-lead zircon dates on volcanic
rocks just below and just above the event
are the same to within the measurement
error of one million years (5)."
