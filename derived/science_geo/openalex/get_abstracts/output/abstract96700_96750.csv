https://openalex.org/W2088377273,"Intensive research in the last decade has revealed a wealth of detail on the mechanism of biosynthesis, molecular structure, and covalent cross-linking of collagen. Tissues of higher animals express a family of at least five genetically distinct types of collagen molecule, each apparently tailored for different construction work outside the cell. Within each genetic type of collagen, further chemical heterogeneity is also evident; the variations in hydroxylation, glycosylation, and cross-linking are dependent, for example, on tissue type, age, and hormonal status. The functional significance of collagen's molecular diversity and its control by different cells and tissues are not yet well understood but abnormalities of collagen in many human diseases keep this protein a focal molecule of medical research."
https://openalex.org/W2046807632,"The protozoan parasite Babesia bovis, a causative agent of bovine babesiosis, has been continuously cultivated in a settled layer of bovine erythrocytes. Lowered oxygen tension within the layer of host erythrocytes results in a darkening of infected cultures and provides a rapid means of evaluating parasite growth. Deprivation of carbon dioxide causes the merozoites to accumulate in the medium rather than involving new erythrocytes. When separated from the culture, these extraerythrocytic parasites retain their infectivity. Parasites produced in vitro are morphologically identical to parasites from the blood of infected cattle and are susceptible to antibabesial drugs."

Reducing the rate of acoustic change within syllables while keeping their phonemic characteristics constant significantly decreased the characteristic asymmetry in processing speech."
https://openalex.org/W2019597479,"The distribution of gray matter in the two cerebral hemispheres was determined by the xenon-133 inhalation method. There was more gray matter relative to white matter in the left hemisphere than in the right, particularly in the frontal and precentral regions. This finding suggests that the organization of the left hemisphere, relative to that of the right, emphasizes processing or transfer within regions, or both, rather than transfer across regions."
https://openalex.org/W1977595194,"Sex steroid hormones and catecholamines have physiological interactions in the brain. By the combined use of autoradiography and fluorescence histochemistry, steroid hormone target sites and catecholamine neurons were visualized simultaneously in the same tissue preparation. By this dual localization method, [3H]estradiol and [3H]dihydrotestosterone target sites were identified in nuclei of many catecholamine cell bodies in the brainstem, and catecholamine nerve terminals were observed near certain steroid hormone target neurons. These results suggest close anatomical interrelations between steroid hormone sites of action and catecholamine sites of production and action in the brain."

Sensitivity to these stimuli decreases during voluntary blinks. This indicates that the source of the deficit is neural rather than optical. Such a visual loss may help to explain the common experience that most blinks go unnoticed."
https://openalex.org/W2091900077,"Vomeronasal chemoreceptors segregated within the vomeronasal organ are important for male hamster sexual behavior. An autonomically controlled vascular pump, previously demonstrated in anesthetized animals, can transport stimuli to the receptors. Interruption of the efferent nerves controlling the pump results in behavioral deficits similar to those produced by interruption of the afferent nerves carrying information from the vomeronasal organ to the brain. Pump activation is thus a prerequisite for normal vomeronasal stimulation in behaving animals."

Adenocarcinoma of the colon occurs adjacent to the urine inlet. It is completely prevented by proximal diversion of the feces, implying that fecal carcinogens are activated locally by the urine or the urothelium."

https://openalex.org/W2150582811,"Aequorin signals in mammalian heart muscle cells reveal the existence of two temporally distinct processes that increase cytoplasmic calcium ions after membrane excitation. The differential dependence of these processes on the pattern of stimulation suggests that the first process is, or is closely related to, calcium entry through the surface membrane and that the second is calcium release from intracellular storage sites."
https://openalex.org/W2020752107,"The life-span in vitro and other proliferative characteristics of a strain of endothelial cells cloned from the aorta of a fetal calf were examined. Cultures of these cells had a replicative life-span of approximately 80 cumulative population doublings. Growth rates in the logarithmic phase and plateau densities decreased as the cumulative population-doubling level increased. After approximately 65 percent of the life-span of a culture was completed, the percentage of cells that incorporated [3H]thymidine during a 24-hour labeling period began to decrease rapidly. The cells expressed factor VIII antigen and their intercellular borders were stainable with silver nitrate throughout the life-span of each culture. Average cellular attachment size increased more than threefold between cumulative population-doubling levels 41 and 80. The facility with which cloned strains of endothelial cells can be isolated should encourage further exploitation of this important cell culture model."

https://openalex.org/W1968287366,"Fourteen rats with bilaterally implanted lateral hypothalamic electrodes were allowed to self-stimulate each side of the brain during daily test sessions. Rotation (circling behavior) during self-stimulation sessions was also recorded. All rats rotated in preferential direction regardless of the side of the brain stimulated, and, in each case, the direction was the same as that subsequently determined in response to d-amphetamine. All rats had asymmetries in self-stimulation thresholds related to the direction of rotation. Thresholds were lower on the side contralateral to the direction of rotation, and entire rate-intensity functions were displaced to the left on that side. The results, discussed in terms of lateralization of affect, suggest a model in which quantitative differences in neuronal firing can be translated into apparent qualitative specialization, with the two sides of the brain appearing to be specialized for high and low mood, respectively."

No dose-response was observed with respect to quantity or duration of use or the two combined. No evidence was found to suggest that artificial sweeteners or diet beverages promote the tumorigenic effect of tobacco smoking. Artificial sweetener and diet beverage use strongly reflected socioeconomic status among controls with various diagnoses."
https://openalex.org/W2104417442,"Regulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity of cultured human skin fibroblasts was studied by measuring 4 degrees C binding of 125I-LDL after cells were incubated at 37 degrees C with medium containing varying lipoprotein and serum compositions. When cells grown on medium containing 10% human whole serum were exposed to medium containing 10% human lipoprotein-deficient serum, LDL receptor activity increased within 4 h and then decreased between 12 and 24 h. This early, transient increase in binding was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that new protein synthesis was involved. Changing the medium also produced a drop in cell total cholesterol content within the first 4 h, suggesting that cholesterol efflux initiated the rapid increase in LDL receptor activity. Cells incubated for 4 h with medium designed to promote cholesterol flux into the cell (plus whole serum or LDL) or minimize efflux (no serum or lipoprotein-free medium) had lower LDL receptor activities than cells incubated for 4 h with medium that appeared to promote cholesterol efflux (plus lipoprotein-deficient serum or high density lipoproteins3). The promotion of cholesterol efflux and acute activation of the LDL receptor by lipoprotein-deficient serum appear to be saturable processes. The direct addition of fresh lipoprotein-deficient serum to the medium partially reversed the secondary decrease in LDL receptor activity that followed the initial acute increase. Frequent medium changes enhanced the long term rate of activation of the receptor, depleted the cell of cholesterol, and increased the rate of sterol synthesis. These results suggest that regulation of the LDL receptor activity is a potentially rapid process than can respond acutely to changes in the rate of cholesterol flux into or out of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1506172171,"The peroxidase associated with prostaglandin cyclooxygenase in ram seminal vesicle microsomes will utilize a wide variety of hydroperoxides and reducing substrates. One such reducing substrate, sulindac sulfide (cis-5-fluoro-2-methyl-1-[p-(methylthio)benzylidenyl]indene-3-acetic acid), inhibits the oxygenase, stimulates the peroxidase, and is oxidized to its analogous sulfoxide by the peroxidase. The peroxidase-catalyzed transfer of oxygen atoms from 15-hydroperoxyprostaglandin E2 (15-HPE2) to sulindac sulfide was examined using [18O]15-HPE2 which was prepared enzymatically and analyzed mass spectrometrically. The sulfoxide resulting from sulindac sulfide oxidation was also analyzed mass spectrometrically and found to possess an oxygen atom arising exclusively from the 15-HPE2. Since sulindac sulfide inhibits the oxygenase activity of this enzyme (ID50 approximately equal to 0.2 microM), it seemed possible that the oxygen atom was transferred while the sulfide was bound to this site. However, indomethacin, an inhibitor of the oxygenase with no effect on the peroxidase, did not alter the stoichiometry of sulindac sulfide oxidation, precluding this possibility. These findings are discussed in the context of identifying the nature of the actual oxidant and distinguishing between the oxidation mechanisms of various peroxidases and between sulindac sulfide and other reducing substrates for these enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2090639213,Intensity fluctuations in a laser beam scattered by nonbeating isolated rat cardiac muscle varied directly with the calcium concentrations in the bathing fluid. The steady-state level of these fluctuations varied directly with calcium-dependent force suggesting that the intensity fluctuations reflect an interaction of calcium ions with the myofilaments. The demonstration that both a portion of resting force and the frequency of intensity fluctuations vary directly with calcium even in quiescent conditions indicates that some contractile activation is present in the resting muscle.
https://openalex.org/W1518504934,"Apparent molecular sizes of D-glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B binding protein of human erythrocyte membranes are assessed by applying classical target theory to irradiation-inactivation data. Molecular weights of this protein as it occurs in untreated ghosts, EDTA-treated ghosts, and reconstituted vesicles of Triton extract of ghosts are 220,000, 180,000, and 220,000, respectively. These results, in conjunction with other findings in the literature, suggest that the native form of the glucose transport carrier of human erythrocytes is a tetrameric assembly of a 50,000-dalton monomer or is a dimer of 100,000 daltons."

https://openalex.org/W1489696392,"In order to study the in vivo methylation of ghost membrane proteins, human erythrocytes were incubated with L-[methyl-3H]methionine. The [3H]methyl incorporation into the membrane components was observed in freshly prepared erythrocytes. Upon treatment of the methylated membrane at pH 7.4, 100 degrees C for 5 min, a condition which is known to hydrolyze protein-carboxyl methyl ester, 80% of the incorporated [3H]methyl was recovered as methanol. Cycloleucine, an inhibitor for S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, inhibited 70% of the methylation. The analyses of the methylated proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two major methylated protein peaks which were tentatively identified as glycophorin A and band 4.5. This methylation pattern is similar to the in vitro methylation pattern when purified human ghosts were methylated with purified protein methylase II and S-adenosylmethionine (Galletti, P., Paik, W. K., and Kim, S. (1979) Eur. J. Biochem. 97, 221-227). It is concluded that carboxyl methylation of erythrocyte membrane proteins is the major methylation reaction in vivo in these membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1584713840,Abstract A comparison by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteins synthesized by antifolate-sensitive (DC-3F) and -resistant (DC-3F/A3 and DC-3F/MQ19) Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells has shown that an apparent molecular weight difference exists between the dihydrofolate reductases overproduced by the resistant sublines. Translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system of polysomal and cytoplasmic mRNAs from the three sublines has shown that the overproduction of dihydrofolate reductase by resistant cells is accompanied by increased levels of dihydrofolate reductase-specific mRNA and that the different molecular weight forms of dihydrofolate reductase are encoded by their respective mRNAs.
https://openalex.org/W1990979524,"Nuclear receptors for both estradiol and progesterone were present in twofold higher concentrations in implantation sites than in nonimplantation regions of the endometrium of 6-day pregnant rats. Decidualization in the absence of an embryo was not accompanied by a similar increase in the concentration of nuclear receptors. Moreover, this difference in receptor distribution between the implantation and nonimplantation areas persisted when a major part of the maternal supply of sex steroids was suppressed by ovariectomy on day 5 of pregnancy. These results support the hypothesis that steroids originating from the embryo affect the endometrial implantation site."
https://openalex.org/W1564410274,"A homogeneous pyruvate-requiring omega-amino acid transaminase from Pseudomonas species F-126 has been examined for its behavior with gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) as omega-amino acid substrate and for its susceptibility to the cyclic dihydroaromatic GABA analogue, gabaculine, a known suicide substrate for alpha-ketoglutarate-requiring GABA transaminases (Biochemistry 16, 4604-4610, 1977). One isomer of DL-gabaculine serves as a completely efficient titrant (no product molecules released) for this omega-amino acid transaminase by the anticipated mechanism of bound pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) derivitization. Stoichiometric titration with [2-3H]gabaculine reveals full inactivation at 0.45 labels/enzyme tetramer (see below), consistent with the subsequent demonstration that there is only 0.45 PLP molecule, bound as phenylhydrazine-titratable aldehyde form, per tetramer. Spectroscopic monitoring of inactivation also agrees with formation, on full inactivation, of 0.45 mol of m-anthranilyl-PNP adduct as the species quantitatively responsible for enzyme inactivation. Incubation of enzyme with excess PLP at 60 degrees C allows loading of enzyme with coenzyme to an average level of approximately 1 PLP/subunit, but even in this case activity is only increased up to 1.5-fold, and 1 to 1.5 molecules of gabaculine/tetramer cause complete inactivation. These data may indicate negative cooperativity between subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1555432182,"Antisera to eIF-2 and Co-eIF-2A have been prepared by immunizing two chickens separately with homogeneous preparations of either eIF-2 or Co-eIF-2A. Addition of anti-eIF-2 or anti-Co-eIF-2A to reticulocyte lysates strongly inhibits protein synthesis and, in each case, protein synthesis inhibition is reversed by the addition of the corresponding homogeneous factor. Protein synthesis inhibition by anti-Co-eIF-2A is not reversed by eIF-2 at any concentration tested indicating an absolute requirement for Co-eIF-2A in protein synthesis. Also, in partial peptide chain initiation reactions, the addition of anti-Co-eIF-2A inhibits Co-eIF-2A stimulation of ternary complex formation by eIF-2 and Co-eIF-2A protection of ternary complexes in the presence of aurintricarboxylic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1607391639,"Abstract The time course of 125I-insulin dissociation from receptors and deactivation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport was measured in rat adipocytes. When cells were incubated with a submaximally stimulating insulin concentration (1 ng/ml), insulin dissociated rapidly at 24 degrees C and 37 degrees C, with a t1/2 of 26 and 14 min, respectively. On the other hand, deactivation of 3-O-methylglucose transport proceeded at a much slower rate. The t1/2 of deactivation was 73 min at 24 degrees C and 43 min at 37 degrees C. Thus, the activated state of the glucose transport system persisted at a time when receptor occupancy had greatly decreased, and hormone dissociation was 3 times faster than deactivation; both processes were equally temperature-dependent. When glucose (1 mM) was omitted from the buffer, deactivation was essentially completely inhibited for at least 2 h despite the fact that the rate of insulin dissociation was unaffected. In conclusion: 1) termination of the insulin signal on glucose transport can be separated from dissociation of insulin receptor complexes; 2) transport deactivation proceeds much more slowly than insulin dissociation and is dependent on some aspect of ongoing cellular metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2143320666,"Mebendazole was highly effective against the helminth parasite Trichinella spiralis in mice subjected to a 3-day course of treatment during the invasive and encystment phases of experimental trichinellosis. When treatment began either 2 or 4 weeks after the mice were inoculated with parasites, the number of larvae developing in the host musculature was greatly reduced by twice-daily oral administration of 3.125, 6.25, or 12.5 milligrams of mebendazole per kilogram of body weight."
https://openalex.org/W1982705383,Extracts of fresh-frozen bovine neurohypophysis were purified by chromatographic techniques to isolate and characterize the components that produce natriuresis in nondiuretic dogs. Two compounds with natiuretic properties similar to those of synthetic arginine vasopressin accounted for most of the natriuretic activity and appeared to be the prevalent vasopressin-like molecules in the extract. These peptides were Ala-Gly-[Arg8]-vasopressin and Val-Asp-[Arg8]-vasopressin; the natriuretic potency of each appeared to be similar to synthetic arginine vasopressin and could be observed with doses in the range of 50 picomoles. In the dog the most conspicuous difference between synthetic arginine vasopressin and the new vasopressin peptides was the smaller pressor responses to natriuretic doses of the new compounds.
https://openalex.org/W2027957394,Fluorescent light induced a dose-dependent malignant transformation in mouse C3H10T½ cells. A plateau in the dose-response curve for transformation was correlated with that observed with ultraviolet light exposure. The similarity in the two dose-response patterns suggests that similar molecular processes may be involved in the induction of malignant transformation by the two types of radiation.
https://openalex.org/W1571808418,"Vitamin K-dependent carboxylation activity measured with pentapeptide substrate (Phe-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu) gradually decreases upon in vivo injection of vitamin K to vitamin K-deficient rats. A decrease in pentapeptide carboxylation can also be observed by the in vitro addition of antibodies against prothrombin and other vitamin K-dependent proteins to the soluble system derived from vitamin K-deficient rat liver microsomes. In both cases, adding back in vitro partially decarboxylated vitamin K-dependent proteins or purified hepatic prothrombin precursor restores the level of pentapeptide carboxylation. After warfarin treatment, a 3-fold increase in carboxylation results, which can be abolished by giving cycloheximide along with the warfarin. However, the resulting decreased activity is restored by the in vitro addition of partially decarboxylated vitamin K-dependent proteins. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that (after warfarin treatment) increased peptide carboxylation is primarily due to activation of the system by precursor proteins, rather than synthesis of an increased amount of enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1604761701,"A light-dependent in vitro protein-synthesizing system from isolated mesophyll chloroplasts of Sorghum vulgare was characterized. Preincubation of chloroplasts in light at 25 degrees C for 1 h depleted the endogenous templates completely; such preincubated chloroplasts translated exogenously added homologous, heterologous, and synthetic templates efficiently. The fidelity of the system in translating added templates was tested with specific templates. Substantive evidence for the fidelity of the system was obtained by immunological analysis of the specific products, e.g. chloroplast coupling Factor I obtained by the translation of S. vulgare leaf cellular and chloroplast RNAs. The efficiency of the system in translating the exogenous mRNA was also quite high. As the endogenous mRNA was totally depleted during preincubation, and as the system was nonspecific for the source of RNA for translation, these chloroplasts can serve as a simple alternative system for assaying the role of diverse template RNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1601307387,"Abstract The products of the reaction of D-[2-13C]ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate with molecular oxygen in the presence of D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase were analyzed, after dephosphorylation, as the trimethylsilyl derivatives of glycolate and glycerate by mass spectrometry. The extent of isotopic incorporation into [1-13C]glycolate from [1-13C]glycolate 2-phosphate produced in the oxidation reaction demonstrates that at least 95% of the glycolate 2-phosphate produced arises from carbon atoms 1 and 2 of D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. When D-[2-18O]ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate was used, a significant amount of [1-18O]glycolate 2-phosphate was formed, indicating that O-2 of D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is retained in the carboxyl oxygens of glycolate 2-phosphate. In addition, analyses of the products of the reaction between D-[2-13C]ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and [13C]O2 confirm and extend the conclusions of an earlier report (Mullhofer, G., and Rose, I. A. (1965) J. Biol. Chem. 240, 1341-1346) that cleavage of D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate occurs between carbon atoms 2 and 3 during its enzymatic carboxylation. The results eliminate possible mechanisms involving the obligatory loss of O-2 of D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate during its enzymatic oxidation and confirm the specificity of carbon--carbon bond cleavage in both the oxygenase and carboxylase reactions."

https://openalex.org/W1519342297,"In eukaryotes, the concentrations of specific tRNAs are closely correlated with the demands for their cognate amino acids in protein synthesis. To account for this phenomenon, we have proposed that the extent of aminoacylation of a given tRNA species in vivo controls the relative rate of synthesis or degradation of that species. Previously, we reported the Friend leukemia cells respond to deprivation of histidine, leucine, or tryptophan by specifically increasing the relative concentration of tRNAs cognate to the deprived amino acid (Weiser, K., and Litt, M. (1979) Eur. J. Biochem. 93, 295-300). In this paper, we show that this is also true for phenylalanine and we report studies of the relative rates of synthesis and degradation of tRNAPhe in phenylalanine-deprived and control cells. We find that deprivation of phenylalanine has no effect on the relative rate of synthesis of tRNAPhe, but does induce a decline in the relative rate of degradation of tRNAPhe which accounts quantitatively for the increase in its relative steady state concentration as measured by in vitro aminoacylation. We conclude that, in Friend leukemia cells, deacylated tRNA species are more stable than charged tRNA species."

https://openalex.org/W1533923612,"Poly(U/sub 3/G) and rabbit globin mRNA were modified with the active carcinogenic metabolite of benzo(a)pyrene, (+-)-7..beta..,8..cap alpha..-dihydroxy-9..cap alpha..,10..cap alpha..-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo(a)pyrene, and the effects of modification on translation in a cell-free protein synthesizing system were studied. High performance liquid chromatography of modified nucleosides from enzymatically hydrolyzed globin mRNA reveals that the active carcinogen formed two adducts with guanosine, four adducts with adenosine, and one adduct probably with cytidine residues. When globin mRNA with 0.4 carcinogen residues/molecule is used as a template, incorporation of amino acids into proteins is inhibited by 50%, and mRNA with 2.4 residues has only 10% of the template activity compared to unmodified molecules. On the other hand, modification of poly(U/sub 3/G) has no effect on its template activity. Since no significant formation of smaller peptides in the protein synthesizing system programmed with modified mRNA is detected, it is suggested that the carcinogen does not block the elongation step in mRNA translation. However, glycerol gradient centrifugation of initiation complexes reveals that modified globin mRNA does not form initiation complexes with ribosomes as effectively as does the unmodified globin mRNA. These results suggest that modification significantly reduces the ability of mRNA to be translated by affecting the initiation step inmore » protein synthesis.« less"
