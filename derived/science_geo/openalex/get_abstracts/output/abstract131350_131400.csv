https://openalex.org/W2163345314,"The origin of CD4+ T cells reappearing in the blood following antiretroviral therapy in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection is still controversial. Here we show, using mathematical modeling, that redistribution of T cells to the blood can explain the striking correlation between the initial CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell repopulation and the observation that 3 weeks after the start of treatment memory CD4+ T-cell numbers reach a plateau. The increase in CD4+ T cells following therapy most likely is a composite of initial redistribution, accompanied by a continuous slow repopulation with newly produced naive T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2085406842,"The generation of autoantibody and subsequent tissue deposition of immune complexes (IC) is thought to trigger the pathogenic consequences of systemic autoimmune disease. Modulation of the autoantibody response disrupts pathogenesis by preventing the formation of ICs; however, uncoupling IC formation from subsequent inflammatory responses seems unlikely because of the apparent complexity of the IC-triggered inflammatory cascade. However, the disruption of a single gene, which encodes the gamma chain of the Fc receptor, was found to achieve this uncoupling in a spontaneous model of lupus nephritis, the New Zealand Black/New Zealand White (NZB/NZW) mouse. Gamma chain-deficient NZB/NZW mice generated and deposited IC and activated complement, but were protected from severe nephritis, thus defining another potential pathway for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2097973787,"The spindle checkpoint regulates the cell division cycle by keeping cells with defective spindles from leaving mitosis. In the two-hybrid system, three proteins that are components of the checkpoint, Mad1, Mad2, and Mad3, were shown to interact with Cdc20, a protein required for exit from mitosis. Mad2 and Mad3 coprecipitated with Cdc20 at all stages of the cell cycle. The binding of Mad2 depended on Mad1 and that of Mad3 on Mad1 and Mad2. Overexpression of Cdc20 allowed cells with a depolymerized spindle or damaged DNA to leave mitosis but did not overcome the arrest caused by unreplicated DNA. Mutants in Cdc20 that were resistant to the spindle checkpoint no longer bound Mad proteins, suggesting that Cdc20 is the target of the spindle checkpoint."

https://openalex.org/W2068069656,"Skeletal Sr/Ca and 18 O/ 16 O ratios in corals from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, indicate that the tropical ocean surface ∼5350 years ago was 1°C warmer and enriched in 18 O by 0.5 per mil relative to modern seawater. The results suggest that the temperature increase enhanced the evaporative enrichment of 18 O in seawater. Transport of part of the additional atmospheric water vapor to extratropical latitudes may have sustained the 18 O/ 16 O anomaly. The reduced glacial-Holocene shift in seawater 18 O/ 16 O ratio produced by the mid-Holocene 18 O enrichment may help to reconcile the different temperature histories for the last deglaciation given by coral Sr/Ca thermometry and foraminiferal oxygen-isotope records."

https://openalex.org/W2122918559,The minor histocompatibility antigen (mHag) HA-1 is the only known mHag for which mismatching is correlated with the development of severe graft versus host disease (GvHD) after human leukocyte antigen-identical bone marrow transplantation. HA-1 was found to be a nonapeptide derived from an allele of the KIAA0223 gene. The HA-1-negative allelic counterpart encoded by KIAA0223 had one amino acid difference from HA-1. Family analysis with HA-1 allele-specific polymerase chain reaction showed an exact correlation between this allelic polymorphism and the HA-1 phenotype. HA-1 allele typing of donor and recipient should improve donor selection and allow the determination of bone marrow transplantation recipients with high risk for HA-1-induced GvHD development.
https://openalex.org/W1522775437,"FKBP12, a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that binds the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin, is ubiquitously expressed and interacts with proteins in several intracellular signal transduction systems. Although FKBP12 interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of type I receptors of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily in vitro, the function of FKBP12 in TGF-beta superfamily signalling is controversial. FKBP12 also physically interacts stoichiometrically with multiple intracellular calcium release channels including the tetrameric skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1). In contrast, the cardiac ryanodine receptor, RyR2, appears to bind selectively the FKBP12 homologue, FKBP12.6. To define the functions of FKBP12 in vivo, we generated mutant mice deficient in FKBP12 using embryonic stem (ES) cell technology. FKBP12-deficient mice have normal skeletal muscle but have severe dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular septal defects that mimic a human congenital heart disorder, noncompaction of left ventricular myocardium. About 9% of the mutants exhibit exencephaly secondary to a defect in neural tube closure. Physiological studies demonstrate that FKBP12 is dispensable for TGF-beta-mediated signalling, but modulates the calcium release activity of both skeletal and cardiac ryanodine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2018523508,"In eastern U.S. oak forests, defoliation by gypsy moths and the risk of Lyme disease are determined by interactions among acorns, white-footed mice, moths, deer, and ticks. Experimental removal of mice, which eat moth pupae, demonstrated that moth outbreaks are caused by reductions in mouse density that occur when there are no acorns. Experimental acorn addition increased mouse density. Acorn addition also increased densities of black-legged ticks, evidently by attracting deer, which are key tick hosts. Mice are primarily responsible for infecting ticks with the Lyme disease agent. The results have important implications for predicting and managing forest health and human health."

https://openalex.org/W2014866628,"Vascular tone control is essential in blood pressure regulation, shock, ischemia-reperfusion, inflammation, vessel injury/repair, wound healing, temperature regulation, digestion, exercise physiology, and metabolism. Here we show that a well-known growth factor, FGF2, long thought to be involved in many developmental and homeostatic processes, including growth of the tissue layers of vessel walls, functions in vascular tone control. Fgf2 knockout mice are morphologically normal and display decreased vascular smooth muscle contractility, low blood pressure and thrombocytosis. Following intra-arterial mechanical injury, FGF2-deficient vessels undergo a normal hyperplastic response. These results force us to reconsider the function of FGF2 in vascular development and homeostasis in terms of vascular tone control."
https://openalex.org/W2016019304,"Mad2 is a component of the spindle checkpoint, which delays the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are attached to the spindle. Mad2 formed a complex with Slp1, a WD (tryptophan–aspartic acid)–repeat protein essential for the onset of anaphase. When the physical interaction between the two proteins was disrupted, the spindle checkpoint was no longer functional. Post-anaphase events such as chromosome decondensation and the next round of DNA replication were not delayed even when the spindle assembly was incomplete. This relief of dependence appears to be a result of deregulation of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis mediated by the anaphase-promoting complex."
https://openalex.org/W2172262465,"Nitric oxide (NO) produced by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is important for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent neurotransmitter release, neurotoxicity, and cyclic GMP elevations. The coupling of NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx and nNOS activation is postulated to be due to a physical coupling of the receptor and the enzyme by an intermediary adaptor protein, PSD95, through a unique PDZ–PDZ domain interaction between PSD95 and nNOS. Here, we report the identification of a novel nNOS-associated protein, CAPON, which is highly enriched in brain and has numerous colocalizations with nNOS. CAPON interacts with the nNOS PDZ domain through its C terminus. CAPON competes with PSD95 for interaction with nNOS, and overexpression of CAPON results in a loss of PSD95/nNOS complexes in transfected cells. CAPON may influence nNOS by regulating its ability to associate with PSD95/NMDA receptor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2056455937,"GA-binding protein (GABP) is a transcriptional regulator composed of two structurally dissimilar subunits. The α subunit contains a DNA-binding domain that is a member of the ETS family, whereas the β subunit contains a series of ankyrin repeats. The crystal structure of a ternary complex containing a GABPα/β ETS domain–ankyrin repeat heterodimer bound to DNA was determined at 2.15 angstrom resolution. The structure shows how an ETS domain protein can recruit a partner protein using both the ETS domain and a carboxyl-terminal extension and provides a view of an extensive protein-protein interface formed by a set of ankyrin repeats. The structure also reveals how the GABPα ETS domain binds to its core GGA DNA-recognition motif."
https://openalex.org/W2039132353,"Ion channels and associated signal transduction cascades are clustered at excitatory synapses by PSD-95 and related PDZ-containing proteins. Mechanisms that target PSD-95 to synaptic membranes, however, are unknown. Here, PSD-95 is shown to partition as an integral membrane protein in brain homogenates. Metabolic labeling of brain slices or cultured cells demonstrates that PSD-95 is modified by thioester-linked palmitate, a long chain fatty acid that targets proteins to cell membranes. In fact, PSD-95 is a major palmitoylated protein in intact cells, and palmitoylated PSD-95 partitions exclusively with cell membranes. Mutagenesis indicates that palmitoylation of PSD-95 occurs on conserved N-terminal cysteines 3 and 5. Palmitoylation-deficient mutants of PSD-95 do not partition as integral membrane proteins and do not participate in PDZ–ion channel interactions in vivo. This work identifies palmitoylation as a critical regulatory mechanism for receptor interactions with PSD-95."

https://openalex.org/W2046338312,"The mechanisms by which Ebola virus evades detection and infects cells to cause hemorrhagic fever have not been defined, though its glycoprotein, synthesized in either a secreted or transmembrane form, is likely involved. Here the secreted glycoprotein was found to interact with neutrophils through CD16b, the neutrophil-specific form of the Fc gamma receptor III, whereas the transmembrane glycoprotein was found to interact with endothelial cells but not neutrophils. A murine retroviral vector pseudotyped with the transmembrane glycoprotein preferentially infected endothelial cells. Thus, the secreted glycoprotein inhibits early neutrophil activation, which likely affects the host response to infection, whereas binding of the transmembrane glycoprotein to endothelial cells may contribute to the hemorrhagic symptoms of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2170229972,"Hurricanes can inflict catastrophic property damage and loss of human life. Thus, it is important to determine how the character of these powerful storms could change in response to greenhouse gas-induced global warming. The impact of climate warming on hurricane intensities was investigated with a regional, high-resolution, hurricane prediction model. In a case study, 51 western Pacific storm cases under present-day climate conditions were compared with 51 storm cases under high-CO2 conditions. More idealized experiments were also performed. The large-scale initial conditions were derived from a global climate model. For a sea surface temperature warming of about 2.2 degrees C, the simulations yielded hurricanes that were more intense by 3 to 7 meters per second (5 to 12 percent) for wind speed and 7 to 20 millibars for central surface pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2084988484,"STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are a family of transcription factors that are specifically activated to regulate gene transcription when cells encounter cytokines and growth factors. The crystal structure of an NH 2 -terminal conserved domain (N-domain) comprising the first 123 residues of STAT-4 was determined at 1.45 angstroms. The domain consists of eight helices that are assembled into a hook-like structure. The N-domain has been implicated in several protein-protein interactions affecting transcription, and it enables dimerized STAT molecules to polymerize and to bind DNA cooperatively. The structure shows that N-domains can interact through an extensive interface formed by polar interactions across one face of the hook. Mutagenesis of an invariant tryptophan residue at the heart of this interface abolished cooperative DNA binding by the full-length protein in vitro and reduced the transcriptional response after cytokine stimulation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2110235974,"The Rad51 protein, a homolog of bacterial RecA, functions in DNA double-strand break repair and genetic recombination. Whereas Rad51 catalyzes ATP-dependent pairing and strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules, regulation of this function is unknown. The c-Abl tyrosine kinase is activated by ionizing radiation and certain other DNA-damaging agents. Here we demonstrate that c-Abl interacts constitutively with Rad51. We show that c-Abl phosphorylates Rad51 on Tyr-54 in vitro. The results also show that treatment of cells with ionizing radiation induces c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of Rad51. Phosphorylation of Rad51 by c-Abl inhibits the binding of Rad51 to DNA and the function of Rad51 in ATP-dependent DNA strand exchange reactions. These findings represent the first demonstration that Rad51 is regulated by phosphorylation and support a functional role for c-Abl in regulating Rad51-dependent recombination in the response to DNA damage.

After incorporation of 390 ng of double-strand φX 174 DNA (linearized with PstI; 1.2 nmol nucleotides) in 3 μl of 50 mm spermidine, the reaction mixture (37.5 μl) was incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were processed as described (34Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and analyzed in 0.8% agarose gels. A vector expressing His tag HsRad51 was prepared by cloning polymerase chain reaction-generatedHsRad51 into the pET-28a-c(+) vector (Novagen). The identity of the subcloned HsRad51 was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestions and DNA sequencing. His tag HsRad51 was expressed in E. coli and purified with His.Bind Resin (Novagen). Phosphorylated His tag HsRad51 was obtained by incubating the resin-conjugated HsRad51 with excess purified c-Abl in kinase buffer containing ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. After washing, the phosphorylated HsRad51 was incubated in the presence and absence of potato acid phosphatase (Sigma) and then eluted from the resin. The final products were dialyzed and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Kinase-active c-Abl (1 μg; 68.9 pmol) and/or Rad51 (6 μg; 0.14 nmol) were preincubated in buffer A for 5 min. φX 174 viral ssDNA (130 ng; 0.4 nmol) and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin were then added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 10 min. Samples were analyzed in 0.8% agarose gels. Whereas IR induces DNA double-strand breaks and activates c-Abl (1Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), we asked if c-Abl interacts with proteins, such as Rad51, that are involved in DNA double-strand break repair. Analysis of anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates with an anti-Rad51 antibody demonstrated reactivity with a 38-kDa protein (Fig.1 A). When anti-Rad51 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl in the reciprocal experiment, the results confirmed a constitutive association of c-Abl and human (Hs) Rad51 (Fig. 1 A). The interaction between c-Abl and HsRad51 was unaffected by irradiation of the cells (data not shown). Also, the finding that DNase has no effect on the coimmunoprecipitation of c-Abl and HsRad51 indicated that the association between these proteins is not dependent on DNA binding (data not shown). To assess the interaction of c-Abl and HsRad51in vitro, we incubated GST fusion proteins prepared from c-Abl with U-937 cell lysates. Analysis of the adsorbates with anti-Rad51 demonstrated binding between c-Abl and HsRad51 (Fig.1 B). Similar experiments with GST-Abl SH3 but not with a GST fusion protein derived from the N-terminal domain of Grb2, revealed binding to HsRad51 (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether the interaction between c-Abl and HsRad51 is direct, we incubated GST-Abl SH3 with purified HsRad51. Immunoblot analysis of the adsorbate with anti-Rad51 demonstrated direct binding of c-Abl and HsRad51 (Fig.1 B, last lane). The c-Abl SH3 domains binds to a consensus proline-rich PXXP sequence (32Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 35Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The presence of two PXXP sites in HsRad51 (amino acids 283–286 and 318–321) provides further support for a direct interaction between the c-Abl SH3 domain and the C-terminal region of HsRad51. To determine whether c-Abl phosphorylates Rad51, we incubated recombinant c-Abl with purified HsRad51 in the presence of [32P]ATP. Analysis of the products by autoradiography indicated that HsRad51 is a substrate for c-Abl (Fig.2 A, left) and not for c-Src (Fig. 2 A, right). Similar results were obtained with S. cerevisiae (Sc) Rad51 (data not shown). To assess whether Rad51 is phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo, we studied HeLa cells that stably express Flag-tagged HsRad51 (HeLa/Rad51) (Fig. 2 B, right). The HeLa/Rad51 cells were transfected to express the dominant negative c-Abl(K-R) mutant or wild-type c-Abl (Fig. 2 B). Analysis of anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of GST-Crk (1Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IR-induced activation of c-Abl is blocked in cells expressing c-Abl(K-R) (Fig. 2 C, left). To assess tyrosine phosphorylation of Rad51, anti-Flag immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P). Whereas there was little if any reactivity of Flag-tagged HsRad51 with anti-Tyr(P) in irradiated cells expressing c-Abl(K-R), IR exposure induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HsRad51 in the presence of wild-type c-Abl (Fig. 2 C, right). These findings provided support for IR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Rad51 by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism. To confirm the in vivo interaction between c-Abl and Rad51, 293 cells were transfected to transiently express both Flag-tagged HsRad51 and kinase-active c-Abl or kinase-inactive c-Abl(K-R) (15Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Whang Y. Sawyers C. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Nature. 1996; 382: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). Lysates from the transfectants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl and analysis of the precipitates with anti-Flag demonstrated binding of c-Abl to Flag-HsRad51 (Fig. 3 B). In the reciprocal experiment, analysis of anti-Flag immunoprecipitates with anti-c-Abl confirmed the interaction (Fig. 3 C). In addition, analysis of the anti-Flag immunoprecipitates with anti-Tyr(P) demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of Flag-HsRad51 in cotransfections with kinase-active, but not kinase-inactive, c-Abl (Fig. 3 C). Thein vivo tyrosine phosphorylated Flag-HsRad51 was purified and analyzed by mass spectroscopy to identify phosphotyrosine sites. The detection of peaks at 1959.4 and 2039.7 in the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated tryptic peptide 40–57, respectively, indicated that Tyr-54 is phosphorylated when Flag-HsRad51 is cotransfected with c-Abl. Importantly, mass spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that the same site is phosphorylated in vitro when recombinant c-Abl is incubated with purified HsRad51 in the presence of ATP. These findings demonstrate that c-Abl phosphorylates HsRad51 on Tyr-54 in vitro and in vivo. To further assess the functional significance of the interaction between c-Abl and Rad51, we asked whether c-Abl affects ScRad51 activity in strand exchange assays. ScRad51 was preincubated with heat-inactivated and kinase-active c-Abl in the presence of ATP before the addition of viral ssDNA. Linear duplex dsDNA was then added for homologous DNA pairing (36Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). ScRad51 mediated the conversion of dsDNA to joint molecules and nicked circular dsDNA in the presence of heat-inactivated c-Abl (Fig.4 A). By contrast, addition of kinase-active c-Abl to the reaction resulted in inhibition of ScRad51-mediated dsDNA conversion (Fig. 4 A). Rad51 binds ssDNA to form nucleoprotein filaments that undergo pairing with duplex DNA (23Ogawa T. Yu X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 37Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of c-Abl on binding of ScRad51 and HsRad51 to ssDNA, we assayed for Rad51-ssDNA complexes that exhibit reduced mobility through agarose gels. Whereas c-Abl alone had no apparent effect on mobility of the ssDNA, preincubation of ScRad51 with c-Abl inhibited binding of ScRad51 to ssDNA (Fig. 4 B, left). Similar results were obtained with HsRad51 (Fig.4 B, right). To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of HsRad51 by c-Abl inhibits binding of HsRad51 to ssDNA, we compared the effects of tyrosine-phosphorylated HsRad51 with that obtained after dephosphorylation with potato acid phosphatase (PAP). Immunoblot analysis with anti-Tyr(P) was used to confirm tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of HsRad51 (Fig.4 C). In binding assays with ssDNA, HsRad51 mock-phosphorylated with kinase-inactive c-Abl and then treated as a control with PAP reduced mobility of the ssDNA through agarose gels (Fig. 4 D). HsRad51 phosphorylated with kinase-active c-Abl (HsRad51-P) and not treated with PAP failed to retard ssDNA mobility (Fig. 4 D). By contrast, HsRad51 phosphorylated with c-Abl and then treated with PAP restored the retardation of ssDNA mobility by HsRad51 (Fig. 4 D). Whereas binding of Rad51 to ssDNA is essential for Rad51-mediated homologous pairing and strand exchange, these findings indicate that phosphorylation of HsRad51 by c-Abl inhibits binding of HsRad51 to ssDNA and thereby HsRad51 function. The present findings thus demonstrate that Rad51 directly associates with c-Abl and that IR induces c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of Rad51. The DNA-PK and the ATM gene product are effectors in the DNA damage response that contribute to the induction of c-Abl activity (9Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M.

In this context, HsRad51 forms a complex with c-Abl that includes ATM (data not shown). Therefore, the available evidence supports a model in which activation of c-Abl by DNA damage down-regulates Rad51 activity and thereby recombinational repair. c-Abl could also affect an essential function of Rad51 that involves interactions with other proteins such as p53 (38Stürzbecher H.-W. Donzelmann B. Henning W. Knippschild U. Buchhop S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1992-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) or BRCA1 (39Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Whereas cells deficient in c-Abl are resistant to the lethal effects of IR (14Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Also, the demonstration that yeast cells deficient in Rad51 are defective in DNA double-strand break repair (21Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) and that HsRad51 promotes DNA strand exchange in vitro (26Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) has supported a role for Rad51 in recombinatorial repair. These findings, together with the demonstration that c-Abl regulates Rad51, suggest that activation of c-Abl by IR (1Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) and thereby inhibition of Rad51 function could determine cell fate by controlling DNA repair and consequently cell survival.

https://openalex.org/W2050179527,"Activation of presynaptic inhibitory receptors or high-frequency synaptic stimulation normally inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission by reducing transmitter release. We have explored the interactions between these two pathways for reducing synaptic strength and found that for synapses stimulated at high rates, agonists of the GABAB receptor become excitatory and strengthen transmission. At an auditory glutamatergic synapse featuring strong synaptic depression, the GABAB agonist baclofen reduced by 90% postsynaptic currents elicited at low frequency. By contrast, synaptic currents elicited at high frequencies were 5-fold larger in baclofen and had a markedly increased likelihood of firing well-timed postsynaptic action potentials. Presynaptic GABAB receptors may thus regulate transmitter release to enable sustained transmission at higher stimulus frequencies, thereby extending the dynamic range of neural circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2022102563,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis desensitize in response to prolonged or repeated agonist exposure, and evidence suggests that this involves activation of protein kinase C (PKC). The present studies were undertaken to determine if cloned mGluR5 undergoes similar PKC-mediated desensitization and to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying PKC-induced desensitization. In Xenopus oocytes, both mGluR5a and mGluR5b showed pronounced desensitization in response to a brief activation by glutamate. Pharmacological studies clearly suggest that this desensitization requires PKC-mediated phosphorylation. Analysis of PKC consensus phosphorylation site mutants suggests that PKC phosphorylates mGluR5 at multiple sites to induce a relatively rapid form of desensitization. Because mGluRs play important roles in synaptic plasticity and in excitotoxicity, this desensitization may be involved in the dynamic regulation of these processes."

Activation of the β-adrenergic receptor or protein kinase A in rat heart cells transformed this Na + channel into one that is promiscuous with respect to ion selectivity, permitting calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) to permeate as readily as Na + . Similarly, nanomolar concentrations of cardiotonic steroids such as ouabain and digoxin switched the ion selectivity of the Na + channel to this state of promiscuous permeability called slip-mode conductance. Slip-mode conductance of the Na + channel can contribute significantly to local and global cardiac Ca 2+ signaling and may be a general signaling mechanism in excitable cells."

The improvement of some affected children following plasma exchange that removed circulating GluR3 antibodies (anti-GluR3) suggested that anti-GluR3 gained access to the central nervous system where it exerted deleterious effects. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of rabbits immunized with a GluR3 fusion protein develops a neurological disorder mimicking RE. Anti-GluR3 IgG isolated from serum of both ill and healthy GluR3-immunized animals promoted death of cultured cortical cells by a complement-dependent mechanism. IgG immunoreactivity decorated neurons and their processes in neocortex and hippocampus in ill but not in healthy rabbits. Moreover, both IgG and complement membrane attack complex (MAC) immunoreactivity was evident on neurons and their processes in the cortex of a subset of patients with RE.

https://openalex.org/W2162359461,"Rapid lithospheric thinning by mantle plumes has not been achieved in numerical experiments performed to date. Efficient thinning depends on small-scale instabilities that convectively remove lithospheric material. These instabilities are favored by hotter plumes or stronger temperature dependence of viscosity, and a simple scaling independent of rheology controls their onset. This scaling allows extrapolation of the results of numerical experiments to the Earth's mantle. Mantle plumes between 100 and 150 kelvins hotter than the background mantle should exhibit small-scale convective rolls aligned with the plate motion. The unusual variation in heat flow across the Hawaiian swell may be due to such instabilities. It was found that the spreading of the plume creates a downwelling curtain of material that isolates it from the rest of the mantle for distances of at least 1000 kilometers from the plume origin. This isolation has important consequences for the geochemical heterogeneity of the lithosphere and upper mantle."

They consist of the O-specific polysaccharide, the inner and outer core oligosaccharides, and the lipid A (1Holst O. Ulmer A.J. Brade H. Flad H.-D. Rietschel E.Th. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 16: 83-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smooth form bacteria synthesize LPSs that are built up of all three structural regions, while LPSs from rough type bacteria comprise only the lipid A and the core region, due to genetic defects in the rfb locus, which encodes O-specific polysaccharide biosynthesis. Furthermore, mutations in therfa locus encoding core biosynthesis may lead to truncated rough type LPSs (2Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Rietschel E.Th. Westphal O. Goodwin T.W.

Biochemistry (Moscow). 1994; 59: 1325-1383Google Scholar), to date only one core type (the Ra core) has been identified in LPSs from S. enterica. The current procedure for detecting Salmonella in food or other specimens involves the isolation and identification of the organisms using biochemical and serological methods that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and also expensive. The application of immunological methods for detecting Salmonella either directly in food or in selective media could help to circumvent these problems. The success of an immunological approach depends on the availability of a specific antibody, and the outer core region was thought to be common to the LPSs of all S. enterica serovars and was thus suggested to represent a genus-specific antigen against which such an antibody could be raised.

Naturforsch. 1952; 7b: 148-155Crossref Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), and from the R4 mutant, LPSs were extracted in addition with phenol/chloroform/light petroleum (12Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) for purposes of comparison, as were LPSs from S. enterica sv. Minnesota R60 (Ra chemotype). The two differently extracted LPSs from mutant R4 are in the following designated as R4a (from phenol/water extraction) and R4b (from phenol/chloroform/light petroleum extraction). The LPSs from the rough mutants of S. enterica sv. Arizonae (R4a, 125.9 mg; R4b, 73.6 mg; R5, 161.2 mg) were de-O-acylated by mild acid hydrolysis as described (13Haishima Y. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1129PubMed Google Scholar). After lyophilization (yields: R4a, 67.6 mg (53.7% of the LPS); R4b, 28.6 mg (38.9%); R5, 99.2 mg (61.5%)), dephosphorylation was carried out in 5 ml of 48% aqueous hydrogen fluoride (HF, 48 h, 4 °C) with constant stirring, followed by neutralization with 8 m potassium hydroxide (KOH) at −10 °C. The suspensions were dialyzed against water (10 liters, three times, 20 °C) and reduced with sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 1 h, 20 °C). Sodium was removed with an Amberlite IR 120H+ cation exchanger, followed by dialysis of the samples against water (10 l, 8 h, 20 °C). De-N-acylation of LPS was performed with 4 m KOH (20 mg of LPS ml−1) as described (14Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and samples were desalted using gel-permeation chromatography on Sephadex G50 (yields: R4a, 41.3 mg (32.8% of the LPS); R4b, 18.1 mg (24.6%); R5, 52.3 mg (32.4%)). The core oligosaccharides of the de-O-acylated and dephosphorylated LPS from mutant R5 (3 mg) were isolated after hydrolysis with 1% acetic acid (0.5 ml, 2 h, 100 °C), centrifugation (3000 × g, 30 min), and lyophilization of the supernatant. Smooth form LPSs (202.1 mg) were hydrolyzed with 1% acetic acid (100 min, 100 °C), and the polysaccharide fraction (105.8 mg, 52.4% of the LPS) was isolated after centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min) and lyophilization of the water phase and was separated using gel-permeation chromatography on Sephadex G50. The second fraction (15.0 mg, 7.4%) was further purified by semipreparative high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) at 4 ml min−1 as described (14Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Holst O. Bock K. Brade L. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with the modification that the column was eluted using a gradient program of water to 120 mm aqueous sodium acetate (pH 6.0) over 25 min, followed by isocratic elution at 120 mm sodium acetate over 35 min. The purity of the fractions obtained was analyzed by analytical HPAEC (15Holst O. Bock K. Brade L. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the second fraction (fraction SR) was desalted on Sephadex G50, lyophilized (2.7 mg, 1.3% of the LPS), and used for further analyses. Mild base treatment of 100 μg of the smooth form LPS was carried out for MS analysis in 250 μl of methanol and 250 μl of ammonium hydroxide solution (25% NH3 in water) overnight at ambient temperature followed by lyophilization. The LPSs from S. enterica sv. Minnesota R60 (100 mg) were first dephosphorylated with 48% aqueous HF (5 ml, 48 h, 4 °C), then reduced and de-O-acylated (13Haishima Y. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1129PubMed Google Scholar). The sample (50 mg, 50% of the LPS) was de-N-acylated (10 mg ml−1) with 4 m KOH and separated using gel-permeation chromatography on Sephadex G10. The fractions obtained were lyophilized, and their purity and composition were investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The third fraction comprising the complete carbohydrate chain of the core-lipid A region was used for NMR analyses (yield: 2.3 mg (2.3% of the LPS)). The conditions for gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gel-permeation chromatography, and determination of the absolute configurations of monosaccharide residues were as reported (16Vinogradov E.V. Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Broady K.W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), as well as the analytical methods for the determination of phosphates, GlcN, Kdo, and neutral monosaccharide residues (17Kaca W. de Jongh-Leuvenink J. Zähringer U. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 179: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Acetylation and methylation together with the remaining steps of linkage analysis (hydrolysis, reduction, and acetylation) were carried out as described (18López-Lara I.M. van den Berg J.D.J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Glushka J. Lugtenberg B.J.J. Spaink H.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For methylation analysis of the Kdo region (19Tacken A. Rietschel E.Th. Brade H. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 149: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the LPS from S. enterica sv. Arizonae mutant R5 was methylated according to Ref.20Hakomori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1964; 55: 205-208PubMed Google Scholar, followed by evaporation of methyl iodide and then dialysis. This procedure was repeated, followed by carboxyl reduction (NaBH4), dialysis, and a third methylation. The sample was hydrolyzed with 0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid (1 h, 100 °C), evaporated, carbonyl-reduced (NaB2H4), and divided into two halves. One half was acetylated and analyzed by GC-MS. The other half was methylated with C2H3I, then hydrolyzed with 1m trifluoroacetic acid (1 h, 120 °C), carbonyl-reduced (NaB2H4), acetylated, and analyzed by GC-MS. For methylation analysis of the complete core region, S-form LPS was dephosphorylated, then reduced, and de-O-acylated. Three mg of this sample were methylated according to (20Hakomori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1964; 55: 205-208PubMed Google Scholar), after which methyl iodide was evaporated and the sample was dialyzed, followed by repetition of this procedure. The sample was divided into two halves, one of which was successively hydrolyzed in 90% aqueous formic acid (1 ml, 3 h, 100 °C) and 0.25 N sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 1 ml, 16 h, 100 °C), and the other in 4 m trifluoroacetic acid (1 ml, 4 h, 100 °C). After neutralization, the samples wereN-acetylated (21Holst O. Broer W. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mamat U. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), reduced (NaB2H4), acetylated, and analyzed by GC-MS. For methylation analysis of the core region of mutant R5, its de-O-acylated LPS (4 mg) was methylated according to Ref. 20Hakomori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1964; 55: 205-208PubMed Google Scholar, followed by evaporation of methyl iodide and dialysis, and repetition of this procedure. The sample was hydrolyzed in 4 m trifluoroacetic acid (1 ml, 4 h, 100 °C), evaporated, reduced (NaB2H4), acetylated, and analyzed by GC-MS. Positive and negative ion mode fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was carried out using the first two sectors of a Jeol JMS-SX/SX102A tandem mass spectrometer operating at 7 kV (mass range m/z 200–3500), 8 kV (mass range m/z 200–3000), or 10 kV (mass range m/z200–2400) accelerating voltage. The FAB gun was operated at an emission current of 10 mA with xenon as the bombarding gas. Spectra were scanned at a speed of 30 s for the full mass range specified by the accelerating voltage used, and were recorded and processed on a Hewlett-Packard HP 9000 data system. Tandem mass spectra (FAB-MS-MS) were obtained following collision-induced dissociation (CID) in the third field free region using the same instrument under similar conditions with helium as collision gas at a pressure sufficient to reduce the parent ion to one half of its original intensity. In all experiments, the matrix used was thioglycerol (2–3 μl) acidified by adding 1 μl of concentrated trifluoroacetic acid in water (for underivatized samples) or 1 μl of methanolic hydrochloric acid (for derivatized samples). Underivatized samples were dissolved in water, and derivatized samples were dissolved in methanol. The probe was loaded with 1 μl of sample solution. GC-MS was performed on a Fisons MD 800 mass spectrometer fitted with an Interscience 8000 gas chromatograph using an on-column injector with helium as the carrier gas. The monosaccharide derivatives were separated on a DB-5MS column (0.25 mm × 30 m, J&W Scientific) using the following temperature program: 50 °C for 2 min, a gradient of 40 °C min−1 to 130 °C, 130 °C for 2 min, a gradient of 4 °C min−1 to 230 °C, and finally 230 °C for 2 min. Mass spectra were obtained under conditions of electron impact in the positive ion mode and were recorded by linear scanning of the mass range m/z 55–400 at an ionization potential of 70 eV. Fraction SR (2.7 mg) was dissolved in 2.7 ml of water so that a final concentration of about 1 μg μl−1 was obtained. Negative mode electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were obtained on a VG Platform II single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Aliquots of 5 μl of the sample were infused into a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v) and introduced into the electrospray source at a flow rate of 5 μl min−1. Spectra were scanned at a speed of 10 s for m/z 800–2200, with a cone voltage of −80 V or −60 V and recorded and processed using the MassLynx software, version 2.0. Mass calibration was performed by multiple-ion monitoring of horse-heart myoglobin signals. Structural assignments were made from sample solutions in 2H2O (about 3.8 mg ml−1) at p2H 7.1. Spectra were recorded in 5-mm tubes at 500.13 and 600.13 MHz for 1H and 125.77 or 150.90 MHz for 13C with a Varian Unity INOVA 500 or a Bruker AMX 600 spectrometer, and chemical shifts reported relative to internal acetone (2.23 ppm, 2HOH at 4.67 ppm at 37 °C). Coupling constants (±0.5 Hz) were determined on a first-order basis. The 13C resonances are reported relative to internal dioxane (67.4 ppm). A one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum was recorded on the Bruker AMX 600 spectrometer using 16,000 data points and a sweep width of 6250 Hz. The phase-sensitive correlated spectroscopy (COSY) experiments were performed using double-quantum filtering (22Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar, 23Piantini U. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1880) Google Scholar) with the Bruker COSYPHDQ microprogram. In the F2 dimension, 4000 data points were collected giving an acquisition time of 0.492 s. The data matrix was zero-filled in the F1 dimension to give a matrix of 4000 × 2000 points and was resolution-enhanced in both dimensions by a shifted sine-bell function before Fourier transformation. The total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) (24Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3095) Google Scholar) and the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) (25Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4809) Google Scholar) experiments were carried out in the phase-sensitive mode according to the method of States et al. (26States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). A decoupling in the presence of scalar interactions (27Rucker S.P. Shaka A.J. Mol. Phys. 1989; 68: 509-517Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar) spin lock pulse sequence was used in the TOCSY experiment with a mixing time of 125 ms and a spin lock power of 7300 Hz. The NOESY experiments were performed with a mixing time of 200 ms. The intensities of NOESY cross-peaks were classified as either strong, medium, or weak using cross-peaks from intra-ring proton-proton contacts for calibration. The 1H,13C correlation experiment was performed in the inverse mode, as a heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) experiment (28Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar). This uses the bilinear rotation decoupling (29Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 52: 330-334Google Scholar) pulse sequence to suppress protons attached to 12C with a pulse delay of 400 ms (30Lerner L. Bax A. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 166: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 13C couplings were decoupled during acquisition using the globally optimized alternating phase rectangular pulse sequence (31Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) with a transmitter power corresponding to a 90° pulse of 106 ms. The experiment was performed in the phase-sensitive mode by the States time-proportional phase incrementation phase-cycling method (32Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar) acquiring a total of 4000 points over a sweep width of 4545 Hz in F2 and 1000 in F1 over 13,500 Hz. Processing was performed using standard Bruker software after zero-filling to 2000 in F1. Broad band 1H-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were recorded at 101.25 Hz on a Bruker DRX 250 at ambient temperature. Spectra were acquired using a sweep width of 10,100 Hz and 8000 data points. Pulses of 90° were applied for 9 ms with a pulse repetition time of 0.4 s and a pre-acquisition delay of 2 s. Chemical shifts were given in ppm relative to an external reference of 85% phosphoric acid. A proton-detected one-dimensional1H,31P HMQC spectrum was recorded on the same instrument at ambient temperature with an evolution delay of 60 ms using a sweep width of 2000 Hz and 4000 data points. The two-dimensional 1H,31P HMQC experiment was carried out under the same conditions using a sweep width of 624 Hz. In the F2 dimension, 1000 data points were collected giving an acquisition time of 0.82 s. The data matrix was zero-filled twice in the F1 dimension to give a matrix of 1000 × 256 points using linear prediction. The COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and HMQC spectra were assigned using the computer program PRONTO (33Kjær M. Andersen K.V. Poulsen F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 289C: 288-307Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which allows the simultaneous display of different two-dimensional spectra and the individual labeling of cross-peaks. The HSEA/Monte Carlo calculation was performed as reported (34Duus J.Ø. Nifantév N. Shashkov A.S. Khatuntseva E.A. Bock K. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 228: 25-44Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar).

Monosaccharide and phosphate analyses of LPSs from S. enterica sv. Arizonae O62 rough mutants R4 and R5 (TableI) reveals the presence of Glc, Gal,l-glycero-d-manno-heptose (Hep), 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Kdo), GlcN, organic phosphate, and small amounts of Rha (indicating a smooth LPS fraction) in LPSs from the rough mutants. GC analysis of the acetylated (R)-butyl glycosides showed that Glc, Gal, and GlcN residues possess the d-configuration. Thel-configuration of Rha was determined by others (36Vinogradov E.V. Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Schlecht S. Mayer H. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 253: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The fatty acids identified in the LPS preparations are 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, and dodecanoic acid.Table IMonosaccharide and phosphate compositions of LPSs from strains R4 and R5 of S. enterica sv.

The values suggest that one of the three expected GlcN residues is absent; since the lipid A moiety should possess two N-acylated GlcN residues, we assume that the GlcNAc residue in the outer core region (compare Fig.1) is the one that is absent. In addition, the data indicate the presence of only one Glc residue. An additional quantification of Kdo after hydrolysis with 0.1m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.4, 100 °C, data not shown) (37Brade H. Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) revealed one terminal Kdo residue in each LPS. The success and fidelity of chemical manipulations were checked by monosaccharide analysis. These data (not shown) show no significant differences from those for the unmodified samples presented in TableI. Mass spectrometry was used to determine the details of the core structures present in the LPSs from mutants R4a, R4b, and R5. The dephosphorylated, reduced, and deacylated LPS preparations were desalted on Sephadex G50 and then examined using positive ion FAB-MS. Analysis of the early eluting G50 fraction obtained from the LPS from strain R5 (Fig.2) yields a spectrum containing a series of intense [M+H]+ pseudo-molecular ions in the regionm/z 1300–2050. The most intense ion at m/z 1845 corresponds to a species with a monosaccharide composition of Hex3Hep3Kdo2(HexNH2)2, representing a species having a monosaccharide composition similar to that of the Salmonella Ra core with the lipid A but lacking one HexNH2 and Hex residue. A related but very minor ion is present at m/z 2007, which would correspond to a species with the same composition as that giving rise to the ion atm/z 1845, but bearing an extra Hex residue. In addition, the ion at m/z 1683 corresponds to a species again related to the Ra core but this time lacking one HexNH2 and two Hex residues. The remaining ions in the spectrum correspond to species originating from smaller related components that, in addition to lacking one HexNH2 and one or two Hex residues, also lack one Kdo and/or a second HexNH2 residue. Partial cleavage of monosaccharide residues during the chemical modifications is assumed to account for this heterogeneity. The acid-labile Kdo glycosidic linkage is partially cleaved on HF treatment, giving rise to the ions atm/z 1625 and 1463, representing species containing only one Kdo residue. The ions at m/z 1684 and 1464 also arise as artifacts of HF treatment 2O. Holst, unpublished results.and represent species in which the reducing terminal HexNH2 of the lipid A is cleaved prior to reduction. These species thus possess only one lipid A HexNH2 residue and this became reduced. Similarly, the ions at m/z 1464 and 1302 correspond to species lacking both the Kdo and the lipid A HexNH2residue. The less intense ion observed at m/z 1359 probably arises by β-cleavage, and corresponds to a component with the monosaccharide composition Hep3Kdo2(HexNH2)2. Apart from small differences in relative ion intensities, the FAB-mass spectra of the two later eluting G50 fractions from R5, as well as those from the G50 fractions from R4a and R4b resemble that of the early eluting G50 fraction of R5. This indicates that the difference in extraction methods used to obtain R4a and R4b LPSs does not influence the types of LPS molecules isolated, but only their relative amounts. The de-O-acylated, dephosphorylated LPSs from strain R5 were further modified to reduce the heterogeneity of the preparation to obtain more detailed information on the arrangement of the hexoses in the outer core. Mild hydrolysis in 1% aqueous acetic acid was carried out to cleave the linkage between the inner core and lipid A, and to remove the remainin"

https://openalex.org/W2023144832,"Human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcribes its single-stranded RNA genome making a DNA copy. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA is simultaneously degraded to oligomers; one of these, the polypurine tract, primes synthesis of a plus strand DNA. The viral reverse transcriptase (RT) degrades all of the non-polypurine tract oligomers. We show that unlike other DNA polymerases the retroviral RT can bind either end of an annealed RNA primer, the 5′-end for degradation and the 3′-end for synthesis. The competition between the two binding modes at any primer determines whether it will be extended or degraded. The 5′-end binding can be suppressed in at least two ways. The sequence of the primer can be such that a region at the 5′-end is unannealed or a DNA primer can be annealed just adjacent to the 5′-end of the RNA primer. This promotes binding of RT to the RNA 3′-end, allowing a primer that would normally be degraded to be extended. Implications for human immunodeficiency virus replication and antiviral therapy are discussed. Human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcribes its single-stranded RNA genome making a DNA copy.

Reverse transcriptase (RT) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PPT, polypurine tract; cPPT, central polypurine tract; nt, nucleotide(s); wt, wild type. catalyzes the conversion of retroviral single-stranded genomic RNA to double-stranded DNA following entry of the virus into the cytoplasm of the host cell. RT is a multifunctional enzyme that displays DNA polymerase activity on both RNA and DNA templates, RNase H, strand displacement, and strand transfer functions, which are all essential steps in viral replication (1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 49-83Google Scholar). Minus strand DNA synthesis is initiated from a cellular tRNA primer packaged within the virion (for a review see Ref. 2Litvak S. Litvak S. Retroviral Reverse Transcriptase. Chapman and Hall, New York1996: 83-114Google Scholar). DNA synthesis is accompanied by the cleavage of genomic RNA by the RT-RNase H. A critical component of retroviral replication is the creation and extension of a polypurine-rich genomic RNA fragment, the polypurine tract (PPT), that primes plus strand DNA synthesis (3Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-117Google Scholar). According to the model of reverse transcription for viral replication, the proper utilization and precise removal of both minus strand and plus strand RNA primers are vital for the creation of the proper length terminal repeat ends required for proviral integration (4Gilboa G.M.

RNA fragments of size ranging from 13 to 45 nts are left behind uncleaved and remain annealed to the newly synthesized minus strand DNA. We have shown that these can be removed by a rebinding of the RT to each RNA segment (9Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

During this rebinding, positioning of the RT and subsequent cleavage is dictated by the 5′-end of the substrate RNA primer now recessed on the DNA template as shown in Fig. 1 B. Initial cleavage occurred between 14 and 20 nts from the RNA 5′-end, a distance reminiscent of the spatial separation between the polymerase and RNase H active sites (9Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M.

Only a PPT primer could be effectively extended. Furthermore, when a PPT sequence was present within a large segment of RNA, RT specifically degraded the adjoining segments and initiated nucleotide addition from the 3′-OH of the consensus PPT sequence (19Fuentes G.M.

In vivo, synthesis initiated from any RNA primers from regions downstream of the PPT-U3 junction could not generate ends required for retroviral integration and would be disruptive to viral replication. In HIV and other lentiviruses a second copy of the U3-PPT sequence, referred to as the central PPT (cPPT), is present 5′ to the U3-PPT within the integrase coding region of the pol gene (31Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hungnes O. Tjotta E. Grinde B. Virology. 1992; 190: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33Hungnes O. Tjotta E. Grinde B. Arch. Virol. 1991; 116: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Synthesis from the cPPT appears to improve viral replication kinetics. Although mutations within the cPPT result in significantly delayed replication kinetics, proviral DNA formation competent for replication can still be completed (31Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This contrasts with a mutation in U3-PPT that does not allow complete reverse transcription. Although there is evidence for multiple plus strand initiation sites in both avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (for a review see Refs. 34Boone L.R. Skalka A.M. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 119-133Google Scholar and 35Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and HIV (36Miller M.D. Wang B. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3938-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), extension of RNA oligomers downstream from the U3-PPT has not been reported. Sequence analysis of intermediates in HIV replication revealed that plus strand synthesis initiated from the two PPT sequences was vastly higher than synthesis from any other RNA sequences on the genome (37Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Daugherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, through mutational analysis, Powell and Levin (22Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a stretch of six G residues present at the 3′-end of the PPT is a critical requirement for primer function. The ability of the RT to identify most RNA primers for degradation and only PPT primers for elongation is an important part of the viral replication mechanism. The question remains, what are the features of RT-nucleic acid interactions that preclude the usage of non-PPT RNA segments but allow the usage of PPT RNA segments as potential primers for plus strand DNA synthesis? When a DNA primer is recessed on an RNA template, as would be the case during minus strand synthesis, the preferential association of RT to DNA 3′-ends places RT in a mode conducive for synthesis (Fig. 1, mode A) (9Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10DeStefano J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4330-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This is also true when a DNA primer is recessed on a DNA template, as occurs during plus strand synthesis. However, when RNA primers are recessed on a DNA template, as would be the case immediately following minus strand synthesis, RTs preferentially associate to the RNA 5′-ends (9Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10DeStefano J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4330-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This places the enzymes in a mode non-conducive for DNA synthesis but at the same time favorable for RNase H action resulting in destruction of these RNAs (Fig. 1, mode B). However, the situation with the PPT RNA primer hybridized to the template appears to be different. Here, the RT association to the RNA 3′-end is favored (Fig. 1, mode C). One probable reason for the ability of PPT RNA to support synthesis is the structural resemblance of the PPT RNA/DNA hybrid to the major groove configuration of DNA primers when annealed to template DNA (38Fedoroff O. Ge Y. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Primer utilization could depend on the ability of the RT to catalyze nucleotide addition to one type of primer structure versusanother. Alternatively, it could depend simply on the ability of the RT to bind the 3′-end. Here we present evidence that utilization of an RNA primer for synthesis depends on a binding competition of the RT for the 5′- versus 3′-ends. Results indicate that we can control the efficiency of an RNA primer for synthesis by creating conditions that block binding at the 5′-end, shifting the binding distribution to the 3′-end. Recombinant HIV-1 RT in its native heterodimeric form was purified to near homogeneity and supplied to us by Genetics Institute. The preparation of RT had a specific activity of 40,000 units/mg protein and was free of detectable nucleases. One unit is defined as an amount required to incorporate 1 nmol of dTTP into nucleic acid product in 10 min at 37 °C using poly(rA)-oligo(dT) as template-primer. An RNase H-deficient point mutant of HIV-1 RT (p66E478Q/p51) was a kind gift from Dr. Stuart LeGrice from Case Western Reserve University. An alteration of residue Glu-478 to Gln within the catalytic domain of the RNase H was previously demonstrated to result in an enzyme devoid of Mg2+-dependent RNase H function, and its preparation and purification is described elsewhere (39Schatz O. Cromme F.V. Gruninger-Leitch F. Le Grice S.F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 40Le Grice S.F. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). T4 polynucleotide kinase was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. DNase I, dNTPs, alkaline phosphatase, rNTPs, RNase inhibitor, T7 RNA polymerase, and quick spin gel filtration columns were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Radio nucleotides were from NEN Life Science Products. Plasmid pBS+ has been previously described and obtained from Stratagene. Non-PPT RNA primer 1 (21-mer) was generated by run-off transcription by T3 RNA polymerase from plasmid pBS+ following digestion by PstI. Non-PPT RNA primer 2 (41-mer) was prepared similarly from plasmid pBS+ following digestion by AccI and using T7 RNA polymerase. Subsequently the plasmid DNA was removed by DNase I digestion. Dephosphorylation of the RNA molecules was carried out using calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. A 19-nt PPT RNA (19Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28169-28176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10565-10573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was chemically synthesized and gel-purified by Midland Certified Reagent Co. When required, 5′-end labeling was carried out with [γ-32P]ATP(3000 Ci/mmol) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase. RNA samples were gel purified and quantitated by “shift-up” assays using labeled DNA primers of known concentrations as described previously (11DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4330-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For some experiments, an internally labeled 41-mer RNA primer was utilized by inclusion of labeled rNTPs in the run-off transcription mixture. Concentrations were determined according to Bradford (40Le Grice S.F. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Annealing of RNA and DNA was performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmEDTA, and 80 mm KCl. For annealing, the DNA and RNA components were added in equimolar amounts. Components were mixed, heated to 65 °C for 10 min, and slow cooled over a 90-min period. Final reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1.0 mm EDTA, 34 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 50 μm all four dNTPs, 4 nm substrate, and HIV-1 RT. Reactions were performed at an approximate ratio of active RT molecules to substrate molecules of 1:2, unless otherwise stated. In all cases the enzyme was allowed to prebind to the substrate for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by addition of dNTPs and MgCl2, allowed to incubate for 15 min, and then terminated with 12.5 μl of 2 × termination mixture. For time course analysis, a mixture of all components except dNTPs and MgCl2 was prepared and allowed to react with RT at 37 °C for 5 min. Subsequent to the initiation of the reaction by the addition of dNTPs and MgCl2, 12.5-μl aliquots were drawn at varying intervals, and the reaction was terminated by adding those aliquots to an equal volume of the 2 × termination mixture (90% formamide (v/v), 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1% each of xylene cyanole and bromphenol blue). Eight-μl samples were then subjected to denaturing electrophoresis to resolve reaction products. Unless otherwise specified, both extension products and cleavage products resulting from the action of RT were monitored by employing labeled primers. The gels were then vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography by employing standard protocols (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Exposures were carried out using Kodak XAR-5 or Biomax films unless otherwise specified. A base hydrolysis ladder was generated by treatment of 5′-labeled RNA with alkali according to standard procedures (9Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). MspI-digested fragments of plasmid pBR322 (Life Technologies, Inc.) that were labeled at the 5′-end were also run in each gel as additional size markers. The nucleotide sequences of templates and primers employed are as follows: RNA primer 1 (21-mer RNA), 5′-GGGAACAAAAGCUUGCAUGCC; DNA primer 1 (21-mer DNA), deoxynucleotide sequence of the above and “dT” in place of “U”; RNA primer 2 (41-mer RNA), 5′-GGGCGAAUUCGAGCUCGGUACCCGGGGAUCCUCUAGAGTCG; DNA primer 2 (41-mer DNA), deoxynucleotide sequence of the above and dT in place of U; RNA primer 3 (PPT RNA primer), 5′-UUUUAAAAGAAAGGGGGG; DNA primer 3 (PPT DNA primer), deoxynucleotide sequence of the above and dT in place of U; DNA template 1 (104 nts), 5′-TAGAGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTTTGTTCCCCGAGGGTGTGGGGCCGGTGGCGCCTGTTAGTTAATTCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGACGTGACTGG (the underlined region binds to 21-mer primer); DNA template 2 (58 nts), 5′- GCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCGCCCTATAGTG (the underlined region binds to 41-mer primer); DNA template 3 (80 nts), 5′-TTGTCTTCTTTGGGAGTGAATTAGCCCTTCCAGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGTGGCTAAGATCTACAGCTGCCTTGT (the underlined region binds to PPT RNA primer); DNA template 4 (77 nts), 5′-TGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCGCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACAAT (the underlined region binds to 41-mer RNA; the upstream blocking primers 1, 4, and 5 bind adjacent to this region); DNA template 5 (58 nts), 5′-GCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGCCATTAATTCACAACTTACATATAGTG (template allows the formation of a 20 nt 5′-unannealed region when the 41-mer RNA is bound); upstream blocking DNA primer 1 (forms a nick, upstream of 41-mer primer), 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATA; upstream blocking DNA primer 2 (forms a nick, upstream of 21-mer primer), 5′-CCACCGGCCCCACACCCTCG; upstream blocking DNA primer 3 (binds upstream of PPT with a nick), 5′-CAGCTGTAGATCTTAGCCACT; upstream blocking DNA primer 4 (forms a 1-nt gap, upstream of 41-mer primer), 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTAT; upstream blocking DNA primer 5 (forms a 4-nt gap, upstream of 41-mer primer), 5′-TTGTAATACGACTCAC. Substrate A1 was formed by annealing DNA template 1 with RNA primer 1 (21-mer non-PPT RNA). Substrate A2 was formed by annealing DNA template 1 with DNA primer 1 (21-mer DNA). Substrates B1 and B2 were formed by annealing DNA template 2 with RNA primer 2 (41-mer non-PPT RNA) or DNA primer 2 (41-mer DNA), respectively. Substrates C1 and C2 were formed by annealing DNA template 3 with RNA primer 3 (19-mer PPT RNA) or DNA primer 3 (19-mer PPT DNA), respectively. The only difference between substrates B1 and B3 was that the template sequence was altered in B3 to allow for the formation of 20-nt long unannealed region at the 5′-end of RNA. Substrate D1 was formed by annealing RNA primer 2 (41-mer RNA) to DNA template 4. Substrate D3 was the same as D1, except that it had a short DNA primer (upstream blocking primer 1), annealed immediately upstream of the 41-mer RNA primer. Likewise, substrates A3 and C3 have short upstream DNA primers (upstream blocking primers 2 or 3) annealed immediately 5′ of 21-mer RNA or PPT RNA, respectively. In substrates D4 and D5, the upstream blocking DNA primers (upstream blocking primers 4 or 5) are placed to form a 1- or 4-nt gap, respectively, 5′ to the 41-mer RNA. The efficiency with which HIV-RT can extend the 3′-end of an RNA primer could depend on the binding distribution of the RT at the 3′- versus 5′-ends. We propose that the preferential association of RT molecules to the 5′-end of non-PPT RNA primers is responsible for their inability to support RT-directed DNA synthesis (Fig. 1, mode B). Blocking this preferred association to the 5′-end would allow binding of RT to the RNA 3′-end in a mode favorable for synthesis (Fig. 1, mode C). Such 5′-blocked RNA primers would be efficiently extended by the RT. We examined the ability of PPT versusnon-PPT RNA primers to support plus strand synthesis by HIV-1 RT. Substrates A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, and C2 were employed to monitor DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT. In these substrates either a 5′-labeled RNA primer 1 (non-PPT 21-mer), RNA primer 2 (non-PPT 41-mer), PPT RNA primer (19-mer) or, respectively, corresponding DNA primers of identical sequence (DNA primer 1, 2, and PPT DNA primer) were annealed to templates as indicated under “Methods.” The profiles of the reaction products on denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels are shown in Fig. 2. Priming efficiency was calculated from band intensities determined by densitometry measurements. The proportion of extension product to the total band intensity per each reaction was calculated. DNA synthesis products are either absent or present at a very low level (<0.1% efficiency) in reactions containing substrates A1 and B1 incubated with wt HIV-1 RT. This demonstrates the inability of the two non-PPT RNA primers to support synthesis by wt RT. Instead, the majority of observed products derive from cleavage dictated by RT positioning at the RNA 5′-end as shown by our model in Fig. 1 B (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 1 of each). An initial cleavage about 18 nts from the 5′-end followed by subsequent digestion toward the 5′-end of the RNA result in a final product 9 nt long. In contrast, there is RT-mediated synthesis on substrate C1, PPT RNA (Fig. 2 C, lane 1), as expected. As a control we have employed SequenaseTM (modified T7 DNA polymerase), an enzyme proficient in utilizing RNA primers of various sequence composition for DNA synthesis. Sequenase-mediated DNA synthesis is observed with substrates A1, B1, or C1 (Fig. 2, A–C, lane 3 of each). The priming efficiency obtained using Sequenase was about 40% or more for each of the RNA primers tested. This verifies the capacity of all of the substrates to undergo DNA synthesis. It illustrates that the absence of synthesis seen with wt HIV RT on substrates A1 and B1, with non-PPT RNA primers, is a result of the nature of RT interaction with these primer-templates. The existence of an intact RNA/DNA hybrid was further confirmed by the thorough susceptibility of the RNA segment of the duplex to cleavage by Escherichia coli RNase H (Fig. 2, A–C, lane 4 of each). Furthermore, in substrates having a DNA rather than RNA primer (substrates A2, B2, and C2) HIV-RT carries out efficient DNA synthesis, making a similar amount of synthetic product as that observed in reactions containing Sequenase (Fig. 2, D–F, compare respective lanes). Although a low enzyme to substrate ratio seems to have caused a significant amount of pausing, priming efficiencies on DNA primers for RT and Sequenase-mediated synthesis were about equivalent. The values were found to be >80% for 41- and 21-mer non-PPT DNA primers and about 50% for the PPT DNA primer for all three enzyme preparations. This indicates that all tested DNA primers, of identical base composition to RNA primers employed here, support efficient RT-mediated plus strand DNA synthesis. Experiments with DNA primers also serve as controls to demonstrate that the specific activities of the different enzyme preparations are similar. This further demonstrates that differences in priming efficiencies seen on RNA primers are consequences of the properties of RT-nucleic acid interaction. We considered an alternate possibility that non-PPT primers fail to prime because they are simply not available for synthesis since they undergo destruction by RT-RNase H. Another possibility is that wt RT did perform synthesis from RNA primers but returned to remove the RNA portion following extension. Calculation of priming efficiency in experiments involving labeled RNA primers using wt RT imposes a complication by the inherent ability of RT to return after synthesis to cleave the RNA segment. In the case of PPT RNA, extension followed by precise cleavage at the RNA/DNA junction would return the RNA primer to its original location on the gel. One way to resolve these issues is by using an RT mutant deficient in RNase H function. Plus strand priming by an RNase H-defective RT point mutant was tested on all substrates. The RT-RNase H mutant behaved similarly to the wt RT with regard to priming on all substrates employed (Fig. 2, A–F, lane 2 in each). As with the wt HIV RT, the RNase H (−) RT did not support synthesis from both non-PPT RNA primers (21- and 41-mer RNA),"

We found that p53 function was not essential for staurosporine-induced G<sub>1</sub> arrest. In contrast, MEFs from mice lacking Rb genes showed approximately a 70% reduced capacity to arrest in the G<sub>1</sub> phase following staurosporine treatment. In support of a role for Rb in staurosporine-induced G<sub>1</sub> arrest, rat embryonic fibroblasts stably overexpressing cyclin D1/Cdk4<sup>R24C</sup> exhibited approximately a 50% reduced G<sub>1</sub> arrest response to staurosporine. The role of Rb in determining the degree of staurosporine-induced G<sub>1</sub> arrest did not depend on the function of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16 or p21 because MEFs lacking either of these genes were still capable of undergoing G<sub>1</sub> arrest following staurosporine exposure. Our studies provide evidence of an important role for the Rb protein in determining the degree of staurosporine-induced G<sub>1</sub> arrest in the first cell cycle."
