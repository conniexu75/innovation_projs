https://openalex.org/W2115809399,"For 10,000 years pigs and humans have shared a close and complex relationship. From domestication to modern breeding practices, humans have shaped the genomes of domestic pigs. Here we present the assembly and analysis of the genome sequence of a female domestic Duroc pig (Sus scrofa) and a comparison with the genomes of wild and domestic pigs from Europe and Asia. Wild pigs emerged in South East Asia and subsequently spread across Eurasia. Our results reveal a deep phylogenetic split between European and Asian wild boars ∼1 million years ago, and a selective sweep analysis indicates selection on genes involved in RNA processing and regulation. Genes associated with immune response and olfaction exhibit fast evolution. Pigs have the largest repertoire of functional olfactory receptor genes, reflecting the importance of smell in this scavenging animal. The pig genome sequence provides an important resource for further improvements of this important livestock species, and our identification of many putative disease-causing variants extends the potential of the pig as a biomedical model."

Here we report an HIV-1 gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER)-specific antibody, named 10E8, which neutralizes ∼98% of tested viruses. An analysis of sera from 78 healthy HIV-1-infected donors demonstrated that 27% contained MPER-specific antibodies and 8% contained 10E8-like specificities. In contrast to other neutralizing MPER antibodies, 10E8 did not bind phospholipids, was not autoreactive, and bound cell-surface envelope. The structure of 10E8 in complex with the complete MPER revealed a site of vulnerability comprising a narrow stretch of highly conserved gp41-hydrophobic residues and a critical arginine or lysine just before the transmembrane region. Analysis of resistant HIV-1 variants confirmed the importance of these residues for neutralization. The highly conserved MPER is a target of potent, non-self-reactive neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that HIV-1 vaccines should aim to induce antibodies to this region of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. A novel neutralizing antibody from a healthy HIV-1-infected donor that is specific for the membrane proximal region of gp41 is reported; the antibody has high potency and breadth, is not autoreactive and does not bind phospholipids. Jinghe Huang et al. report a novel neutralizing antibody from a healthy HIV-1-infected donor that is specific for the membrane-proximal region of gp41. The antibody has high potency and breadth, is not autoreactive and does not bind phospholipids. This work demonstrates a conserved site of gp41 vulnerability that is an important target antigen for HIV neutralization, with implications for efforts to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies with vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W2055800694,"The daily solar cycle allows organisms to synchronize their circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles to the correct temporal niche. Changes in day-length, shift-work, and transmeridian travel lead to mood alterations and cognitive function deficits. Sleep deprivation and circadian disruption underlie mood and cognitive disorders associated with irregular light schedules. Whether irregular light schedules directly affect mood and cognitive functions in the context of normal sleep and circadian rhythms remains unclear. Here we show, using an aberrant light cycle that neither changes the amount and architecture of sleep nor causes changes in the circadian timing system, that light directly regulates mood-related behaviours and cognitive functions in mice. Animals exposed to the aberrant light cycle maintain daily corticosterone rhythms, but the overall levels of corticosterone are increased. Despite normal circadian and sleep structures, these animals show increased depression-like behaviours and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation and learning. Administration of the antidepressant drugs fluoxetine or desipramine restores learning in mice exposed to the aberrant light cycle, suggesting that the mood deficit precedes the learning impairments. To determine the retinal circuits underlying this impairment of mood and learning, we examined the behavioural consequences of this light cycle in animals that lack intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. In these animals, the aberrant light cycle does not impair mood and learning, despite the presence of the conventional retinal ganglion cells and the ability of these animals to detect light for image formation. These findings demonstrate the ability of light to influence cognitive and mood functions directly through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells."

Recently, Parkin was found to play an important role in the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria via autophagy in neurons. Although Parkin is expressed in the heart, its functional role in this tissue is largely unexplored. In this study, we have investigated the role of Parkin in the myocardium under normal physiological conditions and in response to myocardial infarction. We found that Parkin-deficient (Parkin(-/-)) mice had normal cardiac function for up to 12 months of age as determined by echocardiographic analysis. Although ultrastructural analysis revealed that Parkin-deficient hearts had disorganized mitochondrial networks and significantly smaller mitochondria, mitochondrial function was unaffected. However, Parkin(-/-) mice were much more sensitive to myocardial infarction when compared with wild type mice. Parkin(-/-) mice had reduced survival and developed larger infarcts when compared with wild type mice after the infarction. Interestingly, Parkin protein levels and mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) were rapidly increased in the border zone of the infarct in wild type mice. In contrast, Parkin(-/-) myocytes had reduced mitophagy and accumulated swollen, dysfunctional mitochondria after the infarction. Overexpression of Parkin in isolated cardiac myocytes also protected against hypoxia-mediated cell death, whereas nonfunctional Parkinson disease-associated mutants ParkinR42P and ParkinG430D had no effect. Our results suggest that Parkin plays a critical role in adapting to stress in the myocardium by promoting removal of damaged mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W2040091043,"Modelling shows that the misaligned orbits of ‘hot Jupiters’ can follow naturally from disk migration in binary systems whose orbital plane is uncorrelated with the spin axes of the individual stars. Recent planetary transit observations have shown that many 'hot Jupiter' exoplanets in close-in orbits are grossly misaligned with respect to the rotation axes of their host stars. This fact has cast doubt on a previously widely accepted model of disk-driven migration as the primary mechanism responsible for moving planetrs from an outer to an inner orbit. In this paper Konstantin Batygin demonstrates that disk-driven migration is not only capable of producing misaligned planets, it will produce them preferentially. The argument rests on the observation that most stars are born as binaries, and that the gravitational perturbations of the stellar companions act to twist the orbital planes of proto-planetary disks out of alignment with the rotation axes of their host stars. The existence of gaseous giant planets whose orbits lie close to their host stars (‘hot Jupiters’) can largely be accounted for by planetary migration associated with viscous evolution of proto-planetary nebulae1. Recently, observations of the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect2 during planetary transits have revealed that a considerable fraction of hot Jupiters are on orbits that are misaligned with respect to the spin axes of their host stars3. This observation has cast doubt on the importance of disk-driven migration as a mechanism for producing hot Jupiters. Here I show that misaligned orbits can be a natural consequence of disk migration in binary systems whose orbital plane is uncorrelated with the spin axes of the individual stars4,5,6. The gravitational torques arising from the dynamical evolution of idealized proto-planetary disks under perturbations from massive distant bodies act to misalign the orbital planes of the disks relative to the spin poles of their host stars. As a result, I suggest that in the absence of strong coupling between the angular momentum of the disk and that of the host star, or of sufficient dissipation that acts to realign the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbits, the fraction of planetary systems (including systems of ‘hot Neptunes’ and ‘super-Earths’) whose angular momentum vectors are misaligned with respect to their host stars will be commensurate with the rate of primordial stellar multiplicity."

https://openalex.org/W2126235341,"A loss-of-function approach in mice is used to show that the methylcytosine dioxygenase Tet1 has a role in regulating meiosis and meiotic gene activation in female germ cells; Tet1 deficiency does not greatly affect genome-wide demethylation but has a more specific effect on the expression of a subset of meiotic genes. DNA methylation on cytosine is an important epigenetic modification, and the mechanisms controlling 5-methylcytosine (5mC) dynamics constitute an active area of research. The Tet family of dioxygenases can catalyse oxidation of 5mC to produce derivatives such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), but little is known about the biological function of Tet proteins. Here, a loss-of-function approach in mice is used to show that Tet1 has a role in meiosis and meiotic gene activation in female germ cells. Tet1 deficiency does not greatly impact genome-wide demethylation, but has a more specific effect on the expression of a subset of meiotic genes. Meiosis is a germ-cell-specific cell division process through which haploid gametes are produced for sexual reproduction1. Before the initiation of meiosis, mouse primordial germ cells undergo a series of epigenetic reprogramming steps2,3, including the global erasure of DNA methylation at the 5-position of cytosine (5mC) in CpG-rich DNA4,5. Although several epigenetic regulators, such as Dnmt3l and the histone methyltransferases G9a and Prdm9, have been reported to be crucial for meiosis6, little is known about how the expression of meiotic genes is regulated and how their expression contributes to normal meiosis. Using a loss-of-function approach in mice, here we show that the 5mC-specific dioxygenase Tet1 has an important role in regulating meiosis in mouse oocytes. Tet1 deficiency significantly reduces female germ-cell numbers and fertility. Univalent chromosomes and unresolved DNA double-strand breaks are also observed in Tet1-deficient oocytes. Tet1 deficiency does not greatly affect the genome-wide demethylation that takes place in primordial germ cells, but leads to defective DNA demethylation and decreased expression of a subset of meiotic genes. Our study thus establishes a function for Tet1 in meiosis and meiotic gene activation in female germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2027235936,"Heavy metal pollution is becoming a serious issue in developing countries such as China, and the public is increasingly aware of its adverse health impacts in recent years. We assessed the potential health risks in a lead-zinc mining area and attempted to identify the key exposure pathways. We evaluated the spatial distributions of personal exposure using indigenous exposure factors and field monitoring results of water, soil, food, and indoor and outdoor air samples. The risks posed by 10 metals and the contribution of inhalation, ingestion and dermal contact pathways to these risks were estimated. Human hair samples were also analyzed to indicate the exposure level in the human body. Our results show that heavy metal pollution may pose high potential health risks to local residents, especially in the village closest to the mine (V1), mainly due to Pb, Cd and Hg. Correspondingly, the residents in V1 had higher Pb (8.14 mg/kg) levels in hair than those in the other two villages. Most of the estimated risks came from soil, the intake of self-produced vegetables and indoor air inhalation. This study highlights the importance of site-specific multipathway health risk assessments in studying heavy-metal exposures in China."
https://openalex.org/W2033244846,"The general transcription factor (TF) IIB is required for RNA polymerase (Pol) II initiation and extends with its B-reader element into the Pol II active centre cleft. Low-resolution structures of the Pol II-TFIIB complex indicated how TFIIB functions in DNA recruitment, but they lacked nucleic acids and half of the B-reader, leaving other TFIIB functions enigmatic. Here we report crystal structures of the Pol II-TFIIB complex from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 3.4 Å resolution and of an initially transcribing complex that additionally contains the DNA template and a 6-nucleotide RNA product. The structures reveal the entire B-reader and protein-nucleic acid interactions, and together with functional data lead to a more complete understanding of transcription initiation. TFIIB partially closes the polymerase cleft to position DNA and assist in its opening. The B-reader does not reach the active site but binds the DNA template strand upstream to assist in the recognition of the initiator sequence and in positioning the transcription start site. TFIIB rearranges active-site residues, induces binding of the catalytic metal ion B, and stimulates initial RNA synthesis allosterically. TFIIB then prevents the emerging DNA-RNA hybrid duplex from tilting, which would impair RNA synthesis. When the RNA grows beyond 6 nucleotides, it is separated from DNA and is directed to its exit tunnel by the B-reader loop. Once the RNA grows to 12-13 nucleotides, it clashes with TFIIB, triggering TFIIB displacement and elongation complex formation. Similar mechanisms may underlie all cellular transcription because all eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerases use TFIIB-like factors, and the bacterial initiation factor sigma has TFIIB-like topology and contains the loop region 3.2 that resembles the B-reader loop in location, charge and function. TFIIB and its counterparts may thus account for the two fundamental properties that distinguish RNA from DNA polymerases: primer-independent chain initiation and product separation from the template."
https://openalex.org/W1984282335,"A general method of cooling polyatomic molecules to ultracold temperatures is reported; the optoelectrical cooling technique removes kinetic energy via a Sisyphus effect, effectively causing the molecules to continually ‘climb’ a hill of potential energy. Ultracold polar molecules are of interest for various fundamental studies, including quantum-information science, ultracold chemistry and physics beyond the standard model. However, a general method for cooling polyatomic molecules to ultracold temperatures has been lacking. This paper demonstrates an optoelectrical cooling technique that can reduce the temperature of about a million methyl fluoride (CH3F) molecules by a factor of more than ten. The scheme removes kinetic energy by means of a 'Sisyphus effect' that causes the molecules to continually 'climb' a hill of potential energy. In contrast to other cooling mechanisms, it proceeds in a trap, cools in all three dimensions and should work for a large variety of polar molecules. The chip-like trap and guide architecture used in this work are well suited to use in quantum-information processing with cold and ultracold molecules. Polar molecules have a rich internal structure and long-range dipole–dipole interactions, making them useful for quantum-controlled applications and fundamental investigations. Their potential fully unfolds at ultracold temperatures, where various effects are predicted in many-body physics1,2, quantum information science3,4, ultracold chemistry5,6 and physics beyond the standard model7,8. Whereas a wide range of methods to produce cold molecular ensembles have been developed9,10,11,12,13, the cooling of polyatomic molecules (that is, with three or more atoms) to ultracold temperatures has seemed intractable. Here we report the experimental realization of optoelectrical cooling14, a recently proposed cooling and accumulation method for polar molecules. Its key attribute is the removal of a large fraction of a molecule’s kinetic energy in each cycle of the cooling sequence via a Sisyphus effect, allowing cooling with only a few repetitions of the dissipative decay process. We demonstrate the potential of optoelectrical cooling by reducing the temperature of about one million CH3F molecules by a factor of 13.5, with the phase-space density increased by a factor of 29 (or a factor of 70 discounting trap losses). In contrast to other cooling mechanisms, our scheme proceeds in a trap, cools in all three dimensions and should work for a large variety of polar molecules. With no fundamental temperature limit anticipated down to the photon-recoil temperature in the nanokelvin range, we expect our method to be able to produce ultracold polyatomic molecules. The low temperatures, large molecule numbers and long trapping times of up to 27 seconds should allow an interaction-dominated regime to be attained, enabling collision studies and investigation of evaporative cooling towards a Bose–Einstein condensate of polyatomic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2018905452,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical event that occurs in embryonic development, tissue repair control, organ fibrosis, and carcinoma invasion and metastasis. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular regulation of EMT, little is known about how chromatin is modified in EMT. Chromatin modifications through histone acetylation and methylation determine the precise control of gene expression. Recently, histone demethylases were found to play important roles in gene expression through demethylating mono-, di-, or trimethylated lysines. KDM6B (also known as JMJD3) is a histone demethylase that might activate gene expression by removing repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation marks from chromatin. Here we report that KDM6B played a permissive role in TGF-β-induced EMT in mammary epithelial cells by stimulating SNAI1 expression. KDM6B was induced by TGF-β, and the knockdown of KDM6B inhibited EMT induced by TGF-β. Conversely, overexpression of KDM6B induced the expression of mesenchymal genes and promoted EMT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that KDM6B promoted SNAI1 expression by removing histone H3 lysine trimethylation marks. Consistently, our analysis of the Oncomine database found that KDM6B expression was significantly increased in invasive breast carcinoma compared with normal breast tissues. The knockdown of KDM6B significantly inhibited breast cancer cell invasion. Collectively, our study uncovers a novel epigenetic mechanism regulating EMT and tumor cell invasion, and has important implication in targeting cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1993160425,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) guide the degradation of cognate RNAs, but also promote heterochromatin assembly at repetitive DNA elements such as centromeric repeats. However, the full extent of RNAi functions and its endogenous targets have not been explored. Here we show that, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, RNAi and heterochromatin factors cooperate to silence diverse loci, including sexual differentiation genes, genes encoding transmembrane proteins, and retrotransposons that are also targeted by the exosome RNA degradation machinery. In the absence of the exosome, transcripts are processed preferentially by the RNAi machinery, revealing siRNA clusters and a corresponding increase in heterochromatin modifications across large domains containing genes and retrotransposons. We show that the generation of siRNAs and heterochromatin assembly by RNAi is triggered by a mechanism involving the canonical poly(A) polymerase Pla1 and an associated RNA surveillance factor Red1, which also activate the exosome. Notably, siRNA production and heterochromatin modifications at these target loci are regulated by environmental growth conditions, and by developmental signals that induce gene expression during sexual differentiation. Our analyses uncover an interaction between RNAi and the exosome that is conserved in Drosophila, and show that differentiation signals modulate RNAi silencing to regulate developmental genes."
https://openalex.org/W1997147102,"Background In recent years, neuroimaging has been increasingly used as an objective method for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Most previous studies were based on invasive imaging modalities or on a single modality which was not an ideal diagnostic tool. In this study, we developed a non-invasive technology intended for use in the diagnosis of early PD by integrating the advantages of various modals. Materials and Methods Nineteen early PD patients and twenty-seven normal volunteers participated in this study. For each subject, we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and structural images. For the rsfMRI images, we extracted the characteristics at three different levels: ALFF (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations), ReHo (regional homogeneity) and RFCS (regional functional connectivity strength). For the structural images, we extracted the volume characteristics from the gray matter (GM), the white matter (WM) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A two-sample t-test was used for the feature selection, and then the remaining features were fused for classification. Finally a classifier for early PD patients and normal control subjects was identified from support vector machine training. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Results Using the proposed methods to classify the data set, good results (accuracy = 86.96%, sensitivity = 78.95%, specificity = 92.59%) were obtained. Conclusions This method demonstrates a promising diagnosis performance by the integration of information from a variety of imaging modalities, and it shows potential for improving the clinical diagnosis and treatment of PD."

Here, we show that C1q protects immature and mature primary neurons against fAβ toxicity, and we report for the first time that C1q prevents toxicity induced by oligomeric forms of amyloid-β (Aβ). Gene expression analysis reveals C1q-activated phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein and AP-1, two transcription factors associated with neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth, and increased LRP1B and G protein-coupled receptor 6(GPR6) expression in fAβ-injured neurons. Silencing of cAMP-response element-binding protein, LRP1B or GPR6 expression inhibited C1q-mediated neuroprotection from fAβ-induced injury. In addition, C1q altered the association of oligomeric Aβ and fAβ with neurons. In vivo, increased hippocampal expression of C1q, LRP1B, and GPR6 is observed as early as 2 months of age in the 3×Tg mouse model of AD, whereas no such induction of LRP1B and GPR6 was seen in C1q-deficient AD mice. In contrast, expression of C1r and C1s, proteases required to activate the classical complement pathway, and C3 showed a significant age-dependent increase only after 10–13 months of age when Aβ plaques start to accumulate in this AD model. Thus, our results identify pathways by which C1q, up-regulated in vivo early in response to injury without the coordinate induction of other complement components, can induce a program of gene expression that promotes neuroprotection and thus may provide protection against Aβ in preclinical stages of AD and other neurodegenerative processes.

https://openalex.org/W2030958512,"High-throughput sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping can be used to infer complex population structures. Fine-scale population structure analysis tracing individual ancestry remains one of the major challenges. Based on network theory and recent advances in SNP chip technology, we investigated an unsupervised network clustering method called Super Paramagnetic Clustering (Spc). When applied to whole-genome marker data it identifies the natural divisions of groups of individuals into population clusters without use of prior ancestry information. Furthermore, we optimised an analysis pipeline called NetView, a high-definition network visualization, starting with computation of genetic distance, followed clustering using Spc and finally visualization of clusters with Cytoscape. We compared NetView against commonly used methodologies including Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and a model-based algorithm, Admixture, on whole-genome-wide SNP data derived from three previously described data sets: simulated (2.5 million SNPs, 5 populations), human (1.4 million SNPs, 11 populations) and cattle (32,653 SNPs, 19 populations). We demonstrate that individuals can be effectively allocated to their correct population whilst simultaneously revealing fine-scale structure within the populations. Analyzing the human HapMap populations, we identified unexpected genetic relatedness among individuals, and population stratification within the Indian, African and Mexican samples. In the cattle data set, we correctly assigned all individuals to their respective breeds and detected fine-scale population sub-structures reflecting different sample origins and phenotypes. The NetView pipeline is computationally extremely efficient and can be easily applied on large-scale genome-wide data sets to assign individuals to particular populations and to reproduce fine-scale population structures without prior knowledge of individual ancestry. NetView can be used on any data from which a genetic relationship/distance between individuals can be calculated."
https://openalex.org/W2058562137,"Proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3-only protein Bim plays an important role in Bax/Bak-mediated cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Here, we provide evidence for a novel prosurvival function of Bim in cancer cells. Bim was constitutively overexpressed in multiple prostate and breast cancer cells as well as in primary tumor cells. Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed that Bim was transcriptionally up-regulated. We have identified eight endogenous E2F1-binding sites on the Bim promoter using in silico analysis. Luciferase assay demonstrated that Bim expression was E2F1-dependent as mutation of the E2F1-binding sites on the Bim promoter inhibited luciferase activities. In support, E2F1 silencing led to the loss of Bim expression in cancer cells. Bim primarily localized to mitochondrial and cytoskeleton-associated fractions. Bim silencing or microinjection of anti-Bim antibodies into the cell cytoplasm resulted in cell rounding, detachment, and subsequent apoptosis. We observed up-regulation of prosurvival proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, which sequester Bim in cancer cells. In addition, a phosphorylated form of Bim was also elevated in cancer cells. These findings suggest that the constitutively overexpressed Bim may function as a prosurvival molecule in epithelial cancer cells, and phosphorylation and association with Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 block its proapoptotic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2008544755,"Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a widely recognised complication of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but there are still limited data from resource-limited settings. Our objective was to characterize the incidence, clinical spectrum, risk factors and contribution to mortality of IRIS in two urban ART clinics in South Africa.498 adults initiating ART in Durban, South Africa were followed prospectively for 24 weeks. IRIS diagnosis was based on consensus expert opinion, and classified by mode of presentation (paradoxical worsening of known opportunistic infection [OI] or unmasking of subclinical disease). 114 patients (22.9%) developed IRIS (36% paradoxical, 64% unmasking). Mucocutaneous conditions accounted for 68% of IRIS events, mainly folliculitis, warts, genital ulcers and herpes zoster. Tuberculosis (TB) accounted for 25% of IRIS events. 18/135 (13.3%) patients with major pre-ART OIs (e.g. TB, cryptococcosis) developed paradoxical IRIS related to the same OI. Risk factors for this type of IRIS were baseline viral load >5.5 vs. <4.5 log(10) (adjusted hazard ratio 7.23; 95% confidence interval 1.35-38.76) and ≤30 vs. >30 days of OI treatment prior to ART (2.66; 1.16-6.09). Unmasking IRIS related to major OIs occurred in 25/498 patients (5.0%), and risk factors for this type of IRIS were baseline C-reactive protein ≥25 vs. <25 mg/L (2.77; 1.31-5.85), haemoglobin <10 vs. >12 g/dL (3.36; 1.32-8.52), ≥10% vs. <10% weight loss prior to ART (2.31; 1.05-5.11) and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on pre-ART chest x-ray (9.15; 4.10-20.42). IRIS accounted for 6/25 (24%) deaths, 13/65 (20%) hospitalizations and 10/35 (29%) ART interruptions or discontinuations.IRIS occurred in almost one quarter of patients initiating ART, and accounted for one quarter of deaths in the first 6 months. Priority strategies to reduce IRIS-associated morbidity and mortality in ART programmes include earlier ART initiation before onset of advanced immunodeficiency, improved pre-ART screening for TB and cryptococcal infection, optimization of OI therapy prior to ART initiation, more intensive clinical monitoring in initial weeks of ART, and education of health care workers and patients about IRIS."
https://openalex.org/W2033814156,"The circadian clock is a core molecular mechanism that allows organisms to anticipate daily environmental changes and adapt the timing of behaviors to maximize efficiency. In social insects, the ability to maintain the appropriate temporal order is thought to improve colony efficiency and fitness. We used the newly sequenced fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) genome to characterize the first ant circadian clock. Our results reveal that the fire ant clock is similar to the clock of the honeybee, a social insect with an independent evolutionary origin of sociality. Gene trees for the eight core clock genes, period, cycle, clock, cryptochrome-m, timeout, vrille, par domain protein 1 & clockwork orange, show ant species grouping closely with honeybees and Nasonia wasps as an outgroup to the social Hymenoptera. Expression patterns for these genes suggest that the ant clock functions similar to the honeybee clock, with period and cry-m mRNA levels increasing during the night and cycle and clockwork orange mRNAs cycling approximately anti-phase to period. Gene models for five of these genes also parallel honeybee models. In particular, the single ant cryptochrome is an ortholog of the mammalian-type (cry-m), rather than Drosophila-like protein (cry-d). Additionally, we find a conserved VPIFAL C-tail region in clockwork orange shared by insects but absent in vertebrates. Overall, our characterization of the ant clock demonstrates that two social insect lineages, ants and bees, share a similar, mammalian-like circadian clock. This study represents the first characterization of clock genes in an ant and is a key step towards understanding socially-regulated plasticity in circadian rhythms by facilitating comparative studies on the organization of circadian clockwork."
https://openalex.org/W2035143588,"Sumoylation affects many cellular processes by regulating the interactions of modified targets with downstream effectors. Here we identified the cytosolic dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) as a SUMO1 interacting protein. Surprisingly, DPP9 binds to SUMO1 independent of the well known SUMO interacting motif, but instead interacts with a loop involving Glu(67) of SUMO1. Intriguingly, DPP9 selectively associates with SUMO1 and not SUMO2, due to a more positive charge in the SUMO1-loop. We mapped the SUMO-binding site of DPP9 to an extended arm structure, predicted to directly flank the substrate entry site. Importantly, whereas mutants in the SUMO1-binding arm are less active compared with wild-type DPP9, SUMO1 stimulates DPP9 activity. Consistent with this, silencing of SUMO1 leads to a reduced cytosolic prolyl-peptidase activity. Taken together, these results suggest that SUMO1, or more likely, a sumoylated protein, acts as an allosteric regulator of DPP9."
https://openalex.org/W2035697582,"Chromatin structure is an important factor in the functional coupling between transcription and mRNA processing, not only by regulating alternative splicing events, but also by contributing to exon recognition during constitutive splicing. We observed that depolarization of neuroblastoma cell membrane potential, which triggers general histone acetylation and regulates alternative splicing, causes a concentration of SR proteins in nuclear speckles. This prompted us to analyze the effect of chromatin structure on splicing factor distribution and dynamics. Here, we show that induction of histone hyper-acetylation results in the accumulation in speckles of multiple splicing factors in different cell types. In addition, a similar effect is observed after depletion of the heterochromatic protein HP1α, associated with repressive chromatin. We used advanced imaging approaches to analyze in detail both the structural organization of the speckle compartment and nuclear distribution of splicing factors, as well as studying direct interactions between splicing factors and their association with chromatin in vivo. The results support a model where perturbation of normal chromatin structure decreases the recruitment efficiency of splicing factors to nascent RNAs, thus causing their accumulation in speckles, which buffer the amount of free molecules in the nucleoplasm. To test this, we analyzed the recruitment of the general splicing factor U2AF65 to nascent RNAs by iCLIP technique, as a way to monitor early spliceosome assembly. We demonstrate that indeed histone hyper-acetylation decreases recruitment of U2AF65 to bulk 3' splice sites, coincident with the change in its localization. In addition, prior to the maximum accumulation in speckles, ∼20% of genes already show a tendency to decreased binding, while U2AF65 seems to increase its binding to the speckle-located ncRNA MALAT1.

Although advanced glycation end products (AGEs) derived from both foods and endogenous nonenzymatic glycation and AGE-associated signaling pathways are known to play a key role in aging and its related diseases, the role of AGEs in adipose aging remains elusive. We show a novel pro-adipogenic function of AGEs in replicative senescent preadipocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, as well as primary preadipocytes isolated from aged mice. Using glycated bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein of AGEs, we found that glycated BSA restores the impaired adipogenic potential of senescent preadipocytes in vitro and ex vivo. However, glycated BSA showed no effect on adipogenesis in nonsenescent preadipocytes. The AGE-induced receptor for AGE (RAGE) expression is required for the pro-adipogenic function of AGEs in senescent preadipocytes. RAGE is required for impairment of p53 expression and p53 function in regulating p21 expression in senescent preadipocytes. We also observed a direct binding between RAGE and p53 in senescent preadipocytes. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel pro-adipogenic function of the AGE-RAGE axis in p53-regulated adipogenesis of senescent preadipocytes, providing new insights into aging-dependent adiposity by diet-driven and/or endogenous glycated proteins.

Although exogenous AGEs are mainly generated during tobacco smoking and the Maillard reaction (a nonenzymatic browning reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars mostly in heat-processed foods), endogenous AGEs are formed through the interaction between proteins and glucose derivatives, such as methylglyoxal and glyoxal in circulation. Endogenous AGEs are virtually formed in all tissues, particularly during hyperglycemic conditions (8.Luevano-Contreras C. Chapman-Novakofski K. Dietary advanced glycation end products and aging.Nutrients. 2010; 2: 1247-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Excess AGE intake and chronic accumulation of AGE-related glycated proteins in tissues are suggested to further potentiate the aging process resulting in impaired mitochondrial function and decreased life span in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice (9.Morcos M.

Glycated proteins are largely known to interact with an AGE-interacting pattern recognition receptor known as RAGE. An AGE-RAGE axis contributes to aging-associated inflammation, oxidative stress, and the development of some of the chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis (12.Basta G. Schmidt A.M. De Caterina R.

However, the precise role of the AGE-RAGE axis in adipose tissue development during aging is unknown. Here, we found that exogenous AGEs were able to restore the adipogenic potential of replicative senescent preadipocytes, whereas AGEs showed no effect on adipogenesis of young preadipocytes. This is through AGE-induced RAGE expression and its interaction with p53, thereby abrogating senescence-associated p53 function in preadipocytes. These results reveal a novel pro-adipogenic function of AGEs in adipose aging in which the AGE-RAGE axis modulates the function of senescence-induced p53, resulting in restoring the impaired adipogenic potential of aged adipose tissue.

Insulin, dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, propidium iodide, and RNase A were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from PAA (Dartmouth, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), penicillin/streptomycin, and sodium pyruvate were from VWR (Radnor, PA). TRIzol® reagent and SuperScriptII were purchased from Invitrogen. A protein assay kit was obtained from Bio-Rad. Twenty mg/ml of BSA dissolved in 0.2% (w/v) Na3N containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was incubated with 100 mm MG or 100 mm GA at 37 °C for 6 days to generate MG-BSA or GA-BSA, respectively. The glycated BSA (i.e. MG-GSA and GA-BSA) was then filtered through a filter with a pore size of 0.22 μm followed by dialysis at 4 °C against water to remove any free form of MG or GA. The glycated BSA was then aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured and differentiated as described previously (22.Kim C.Y. Le T.T. Chen C. Cheng J.X. Kim K.H. Curcumin inhibits adipocyte differentiation through modulation of mitotic clonal expansion.J. Nutr. Biochem. 2011; 22: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Replicative senescence of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was introduced by performing a serial passaging of 70–80% confluent cells. To determine the effect of BSA or glycated BSA on adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells, BSA, MG-, or GA-BSA was either added during the course of adipogenesis or at day −2 to day 0 prior to the initiation of adipogenesis. In a RAGE neutralization study, 10 μg/ml anti-RAGE antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the differentiating 3T3-L1 cells from day 0 to day 2. To examine the effect of inhibition of p53 function on adipogenesis of senescent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of pifithrin-α (Calbiochem) and BSA or glycated BSA at day −3 to day −2 and day −2 to day 0, respectively, prior to the initiation of adipogenesis. The lipids accumulated in differentiated preadipocytes at day 8 were stained with Oil Red O (ORO) as described previously (22.Kim C.Y. Le T.T. Chen C. Cheng J.X. Kim K.H.

Inguinal and epididymal adipose tissues were dissected from 6-week-old and 1-year-old chow diet-fed male C57BL/6N mice for the study in Fig. 1H and 14-week-old chow diet-fed or high fat diet (60% calories from fat)-fed mice for the studies in Fig. 1I. Twelve-week-old and 1-year-old chow diet-fed male C57BL/6N mice were used for the studies in Fig. 3, C and D. All procedures were approved by Purdue University Animal Care and Use Committee. Primary adipose tissues isolated from these mice were digested with collagenase to isolate the SV fraction as described previously (25.Liu W. Liu Y. Lai X. Kuang S. Intramuscular adipose is derived from a non-Pax3 lineage and required for efficient regeneration of skeletal muscles.Dev. Biol. 2012; 361: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The SV fraction containing primary preadipocytes was cultured in 10% FBS/DMEM, and subjected to adipogenesis in 10% FBS/DMEM containing 1 μg/ml insulin, 5 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 2.5 μg/ml rosiglitazone for 3 days, followed by incubation in 10% FBS/DMEM supplemented with 1 μg/ml insulin for 5 days.FIGURE 3Pretreatment of glycated BSA leads to an induction of adipogenesis in senescent HP 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, MEF, and inguinal SV cells.

Levels of intracellular ROS in LP and HP preadipocytes were measured by loading the cells with 40 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCHF-DA) (Cayman Chemical) for 30 min at 37 °C. Intracellular DCHF-DA oxidized to fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein was monitored by the fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems). For quantification of the intracellular 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein, cells grown in a 96-well plate incubated with DCHF-DA for 30 min were subjected to a fluorescence microplate reader (SpectraMax Gemini EM, Molecular Devices) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission of 535 nm. 3T3-L1 cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (22.Kim C.Y.

Primary antibodies used in the study include phospho-Akt (Ser(P)-473) and total Akt (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA), carboxymethyl lysine (CML) (R&D system, Minneapolis, MN), p21 (Genscript, Scotch Plains, NJ), phospho-p53 (Ser-15) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), RAGE, p53, β-actin, and α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and secondary HRP-conjugated mouse and rabbit antibodies (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Protein bands were detected with Pierce ECL Plus Western blotting reagents by autoradiography. Film was scanned and processed using the ImageJ software, version 1.45S, from National Institutes of Health, for quantification of protein band intensity by normalization to the band intensity of β-actin or α-tubulin. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were seeded on coverslips overnight and then treated with or without glycated BSA for 24 h. The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton-contained PBS for 20 min. One percent BSA-contained PBST solution (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) was used for blocking, and the cells were incubated with RAGE antibody (1:50). Primary antibody binding was detected using a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 4′-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Calbiochem) was used for nuclear staining. RAGE and DAPI signals from the cells were visualized by LSM 710 confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). To examine the interaction between RAGE and p53, 3T3-L1 cells treated with BSA or glycated BSA were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. RAGE and p53 in cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-RAGE and anti-p53 antibody, respectively, or control IgG at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by immunoprecipitation with protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with cold PBS four times and boiled with the sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1 m dithiothreitol) for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. ChIP was performed as described previously (27.Cui M. Zhao Y. Hance K.W. Shao A. Wood R.J. Fleet J.C.

The nuclei extracted from these cells were subjected to sonication to produce the chromatin fragments from 200 to 1,000 bp 5× with 20-s bursts using the sonifier W-150 type (G. Heinemann, Germany). For chromatin preparation, the isolated nuclei were precleared with 20 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. 2% of the chromatin solution was used as “input” in Fig. 5, and the remainder was incubated with p53 antibody (2 μg) or a control IgG overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were then recovered by incubating with 40 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The complexes were then subjected to 1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3, and 200 mm NaCl overnight at 67 °C to reverse cross-linking. DNA was then purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and was subjected to reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis to amplify mouse p21 promoter sequences (−2927 to −2595) using a primer set as follows: forward, 5′-CGG AGA CCA GCA GCA AAA TCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGA CAC ATA CAC ACC CC AGG CAC-3′ (28.Ho J.S.

A lentivirus-based shRNA transfer plasmid (pLKO.1) was a gift from Dr. Xiaoqi Liu (Purdue University). All the procedures were described previously (29.Liu X. Lei M. Erikson R.L. Normal cells, but not cancer cells, survive severe Plk1 depletion.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2093-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The targeting sequence of mouse RAGE (GenBankTM accession number NM_07425) is GGG AAG GAG GTC AAG TCC AAC. To generate lentivirus, 293T cells were co-incubated with 4 μg of pLKO.1-RAGE, 4 μg of pHR′-CMV-R8.20vpr, and 2 μg of pHR′-CMV-VSV-G using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Invitrogen). 24 h post-transfection, viruses were then harvested every 12 h until 72 h. The harvested media containing virus particles were filtered though a 0.45-μm pore size filter and centrifuged at 170,000 rpm for 90 min. 3T3-L1 cells were infected with the viral pellets in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene. After 24 h of viral transduction, cells were selected with 1 mg/ml puromycin for at least 3 days. All data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.0 software. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine significance of treatment effect and interactions. Significant differences between group means were assessed by Dunnett's multiple comparison. p < 0.05 was considered significant.

Histamine is released in the allergic response to NSAIDs and is responsible for some of the clinical symptoms. The aim of this study is to analyze clinical association of functional polymorphisms in the genes coding for enzymes involved in histamine homeostasis with hypersensitivity response to NSAIDs. We studied a cohort of 442 unrelated Caucasian patients with hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. Patients who experienced three or more episodes with two or more different NSAIDs were included. If this requirement was not met diagnosis was established by challenge. A total of 414 healthy unrelated controls ethnically matched with patients and from the same geographic area were recruited. Analyses of the SNPs rs17740607, rs2073440, rs1801105, rs2052129, rs10156191, rs1049742 and rs1049793 in the HDC, HNMT and DAO genes were carried out by means of TaqMan assays. The detrimental DAO 16 Met allele (rs10156191), which causes decreased metabolic capacity, is overrepresented among patients with crossed-hypersensitivity to NSAIDs with an OR = 1.7 (95% CI = 1.3–2.1; Pc = 0.0003) with a gene-dose effect (P = 0.0001). The association was replicated in two populations from different geographic areas (Pc = 0.008 and Pc = 0.004, respectively). Conclusions and implications The DAO polymorphism rs10156191 which causes impaired metabolism of circulating histamine is associated with the clinical response in crossed-hypersensitivity to NSAIDs and could be used as a biomarker of response."

In the current study, culture of epithelial ovarian cancer cells on three-dimensional collagen I gels led to a dramatic down-regulation of the Wnt signaling inhibitor dickkopf-1 with a concomitant increase in nuclear β-catenin and enhanced β-catenin/Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity. Increased three-dimensional collagen gel invasion was accompanied by transcriptional up-regulation of the membrane-tethered collagenase membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, and an inverse relationship between dickkopf-1 and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase was observed in human epithelial ovarian cancer specimens. Similar results were obtained in other tissue-invasive cells such as vascular endothelial cells, suggesting a novel mechanism for functional coupling of matrix adhesion with Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2067380846,"Protein polymerization consists in the aggregation of single monomers into polymers that may fragment. Fibrils assembly is a key process in amyloid diseases. Up to now, protein aggregation was commonly mathematically simulated by a polymer size-structured ordinary differential equations (ODE) system, which is infinite by definition and therefore leads to high computational costs. Moreover, this Ordinary Differential Equation-based modeling approach implies biological assumptions that may be difficult to justify in the general case. For example, whereas several ordinary differential equation models use the assumption that polymerization would occur at a constant rate independently of polymer size, it cannot be applied to certain protein aggregation mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel and efficient analytical method, capable of modelling and simulating amyloid aggregation processes. This alternative approach consists of an integro-Partial Differential Equation (PDE) model of coalescence-fragmentation type that was mathematically derived from the infinite differential system by asymptotic analysis. To illustrate the efficiency of our approach, we applied it to aggregation experiments on polyglutamine polymers that are involved in Huntington’s disease. Our model demonstrates the existence of a monomeric structural intermediate acting as a nucleus and deriving from a non polymerizing monomer (). Furthermore, we compared our model to previously published works carried out in different contexts and proved its accuracy to describe other amyloid aggregation processes."

We used NMR spectroscopy to perform a per residue level characterization of the molecular interactions between the unfolded domains 2 and 3 of NS5A (NS5A-D2 and NS5A-D3), CypA, and NS5BΔ21. We show that three regions of NS5A-D2 (residues 250–262 (region A), 274–287 (region B), and 306–333 (region C)) interact with NS5BΔ21, whereas NS5A-D3 does not.

Avian mortality through collision with moving rotor blades is well-known as one of the main adverse impacts of wind farms. In Spain, the griffon vulture incurs the highest mortality rates in wind farms. Methodology/Principal Findings As far as we know, this study is the first attempt to predict flight trajectories of birds in order to foresee potentially dangerous areas for wind farm development. We analyse topography and wind flows in relation to flight paths of griffon vultures, using a scaled model of the wind farm area in an aerodynamic wind tunnel, and test the difference between the observed flight paths of griffon vultures and the predominant wind flows. Different wind currents for each wind direction in the aerodynamic model were observed. Simulations of wind flows in a wind tunnel were compared with observed flight paths of griffon vultures. No statistical differences were detected between the observed flight trajectories of griffon vultures and the wind passages observed in our wind tunnel model. A significant correlation was found between dead vultures predicted proportion of vultures crossing those cells according to the aerodynamic model. Conclusions Griffon vulture flight routes matched the predominant wind flows in the area (i.e. they followed the routes where less flight effort was needed). We suggest using these kinds of simulations to predict flight paths over complex terrains can inform the location of wind turbines and thereby reduce soaring bird mortality."

We examined the efficacy of the semaphorin 3A inhibitor, SM-345431, in promoting regeneration of peripheral nerves in a mouse corneal transplantation model.P0-Cre/Floxed-EGFP mice which express EGFP in peripheral nerves cells were used as recipients of corneal transplantation with syngeneic wild-type mouse cornea donors. SM-345431 was administered subconjunctivally every 2 days while control mice received vehicle only. Mice were followed for 3 weeks and the length of regenerating nerves was measured by EGFP fluorescence and immunohistochemistry against βIII tubulin. Cornea sensitivity was also measured by the Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer. CD31 staining was used to determine corneal neovascularization as a possible side effect of SM-345431. Regeneration of βIII tubulin positive peripheral nerves was significantly higher in SM-345431 treated mice compared to control. Furthermore, corneal sensitivity significantly improved in the SM-345431 group by 3 weeks after transplantation. Neovascularization was limited to the peripheral cornea with no difference between SM-345431 group and control.Subconjunctival injections of SM-345431 promoted a robust network of regenerating nerves as well as functional recovery of corneal sensation in a mouse keratoplasty model, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for treating neurotrophic corneal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2170420143,"Theoretical studies and robotic experiments have shown that asymptotically stable periodic walking may emerge from nonlinear limit-cycle oscillators in the neuro-mechanical periphery. We recently reported entrainment of human gait to periodic mechanical perturbations with two essential features: 1) entrainment occurred only when the perturbation period was close to the original (preferred) walking period, and 2) entrainment was always accompanied by phase locking so that the perturbation occurred at the end of the double-stance phase. In this study, we show that a highly-simplified state-determined walking model can reproduce several salient nonlinear limit-cycle behaviors of human walking: 1) periodic gait that is 2) asymptotically stable; 3) entrainment to periodic mechanical perturbations only when the perturbation period is close to the model's unperturbed period; and 4) phase-locking to locate the perturbation at the end of double stance. Importantly, this model requires neither supra-spinal control nor an intrinsic self-sustaining neural oscillator such as a rhythmic central pattern generator. Our results suggest that several prominent limit-cycle features of human walking may stem from simple afferent feedback processes without significant involvement of supra-spinal control or a self-sustaining oscillatory neural network."

These six SENPs have substrate specificity and different cellular localization and tissue distribution (22.Yeh E.T. SUMOylation and De-SUMOylation: wrestling with life's processes.J. Biol.

SUMOylation attenuates the function of PGC-1α.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26184-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, it has been unknown whether SUMOylation could affect the function of PGC-1α in mitochondrial biogenesis. In this study, we identified SENP1's role as a specific SUMO protease in regulating the SUMOylation status of PGC-1α. By analyzing Senp1−/− cells, we found that SUMOylation greatly reduced the activation of PGC-1α in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Thus, we revealed the essential role of SENP1 in PGC-1α transcriptional activity and also in mitochondrial biogenesis. Flag-PGC-1α and Gal4-PGC-1α were purchased from Addgene. Gal4-PGC-1αK183R mutant and Flag-PGC-1αK183R mutant were generated by using standard cloning procedures and PCR-based mutagenesis. His-SUMO1 and Flag-SENP1 were previously described. We used antibodies against His (Qiagen) and PGC-1α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The generation of Senp1+/+ and −/− MEF cells were previously described (26.Cheng J. Kang X. Zhang S. Yeh E.T. SUMO-specific protease 1 is essential for stabilization of HIF1α during hypoxia.Cell. 2007; 131: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). MEF and 293 T cells were cultured in DMEM (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin). 293T cells in a 24-well plate were transiently transfected with expression plasmids by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated for 24 h before luciferase was assayed using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Renilla luciferase activity was used as an internal control. AAV-SENP1 and AAV-SENP1m were produced using plasmids pAOV-CMV-SENP1-EGFP or pAOV-CMV-SENP1m-EGFP by NeuronBiotech (Shanghai, P.R. China). C2C12 cells were plated in 6-well plate at about 75% confluence and infected with AAV9-SENP1 or AAV-SENP1m at a MOI of 5. The His-tagged SUMO-1-conjugated proteins were precipitated with TALON resin. Cells were lysed with guanidine-HCl denaturing buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 6 m guanidine-HCl, 300 mm NaCl at pH 7.8). The cell lysate was sheared with a 29-gauge needle to break DNA and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 15 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with TALON resin for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl at pH 8.0) and subsequently twice with PBS. The pelleted beads were resuspended in SDS loading buffer, incubated at 55 °C for 30 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol kit (Invitrogen). RNA was treated with DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). Complementary DNA was synthesized using the cDNA synthesis kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence real-time RT-PCR was performed with the double-stranded DNA dye SYBR Green PCR Core Reagents (PE Biosystems, Warrington, UK) using the ABI PRISM 7300 system (Perkin-Elmer, Torrance, CA). PCR was done in triplicate and standard deviations representing experimental errors were calculated. All data were analyzed by ABI PRISM SDS 2.0 software (Perkin-Elmer). Pairs of PCR primers used to amplification of the target genes were as follows: Coxvb, forward-5′-CTATGCCAGGAACCCATCTC-3′, reverse-5′-GAAGGCGACCATCAAACAGA-3′; Cycs, forward-5′-CCCTGATGGAGTATTTGGAG-3′, reverse-5′-GCTATTAGGTCTGCCCTTTCT-3′; Atp5g1, forward-5′-CTGGATCAGGAGCTGGCATTG-3′, reverse-5′-AGGCGACCATCAAACAGAAG-3′; Ucp2, forward-5′-GCTGGTGGTGGTCGGAGATA-3′, reverse-5′-ATTACGGGCAACATTGGGAG-3′; mtTFA, forward-5′-CCCTCGTCTATCAGTCTTGT-3′, reverse-5′-ATTACGGGCAACATTGGGAG-3′; Idh3a, forward-5′-GCTGCCAAAGCACCTATTCA-3′, reverse-5′-AGCCCATCTTGTTCTTATCC-3′; Mfn-2, forward-5′-CCTGTACGTCTATGAGCGACTG-3′, reverse-5′-AATTCCTGCTGGACTTGGTG-3′; Drp-1, forward-5′-TAAATGTCTTAGCTGCTCGGTAT-3′, reverse-5′-TGCGGTTCCTTCAATCGTGT-3′; NRF1, forward-5′-AGCAAGTCCAGCAGGTCCAT-3′, reverse-5′-GTCCGAGTCATCATAAGAAGTGTC-3′; NRF2b, forward-5′-TGGGAACTTCTCCACTTCATCT-3′, reverse-5′-TCCACTTTGGTCCTGGCATCTC-3′; ERRα, forward-5′-CATCACCTACCGTTACACCT-3′, reverse-5′-AAATTGCTTCCGTCCACAAA-3′; PPARα, forward-5′-ATTTGCCAAGGCTATCCCA-3′, reverse-5′-GCATCCCGTCTTTGTTCAT-3′; PPARδ, forward-5′-CCTCAATGACCAGGTGACCCTC-3′, reverse-5′-GACTTCGCAAGAACTCGTGGGT-3′. Results are expressed as relative abundance of mRNA normalized to the internal control 18S, forward-5′-AGGCCCTGTAATTGGAATGAGTC-3′, reverse-5′-GCTCCCAAGATCCAACTACGAG-3′. Mito-Tracker Green FM (Molecular Probes) staining was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. mDNA/nDNA ratio was determined by quantitative real-time PCR on total DNA template isolated from MEF cells. Pairs of PCR primers used to amplify the target genes were as follows: COXI (for mitochondrial DNA), forward-5′-ATGACAAATCCGGTCCGATGGCTGT-3′, reverse-5′-CTTCACATAGCTTTTCGTCTCCTT-3′ and SENP1 (for nuclear DNA), forward-5′-GCACATTCCCTGTCATCTGGT-3′, reverse-5′-GTGTATTTGATGCTGGTAAGCTATT-3′. The cell oxygen consumption was determined by using XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) according to manufacturer's instructions. ATP levels were measured by using ATP assay kit (Roche). For intracellular ROS production assay, the cells were stained by dichloro dihydro fluorescein diacetate (1 mm, Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 15 min. Stained cells were analyzed immediately in a FACS (Becton Dickinson). Results were presented as means ± S.E. The Student's t test was used to compare the difference between two different groups. Rytinki and Palvimo reported PGC-1α as a SUMOylated protein(29.Rytinki M.M. Palvimo J.J. SUMOylation attenuates the function of PGC-1α.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26184-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although they showed that overexpression of both SENP1 or SENP2 can de-conjugate SUMOylated PGC-1(29.Rytinki M.M. Palvimo J.J. SUMOylation attenuates the function of PGC-1α.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26184-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is still important to determine which SENP really regulates the SUMOylation status of endogenous PGC-1α in physiological condition. To do so, we performed an assay by detecting whether SUMOylated PGC-1α proteins were accumulated when SENP was mutated. As it was not available for a good anti-PGC-1α antibody to IP endogenous mouse PGC-1α, we used an approach to purify SUMO1-conjugated endogenous PGC-1α by Talon beads under denaturing conditions. His-SUMO-conjugated proteins were pulled down by Talon beads from His-tagged SUMO1-transfected Senp1+/+ or Senp1−/− MEF cells, and SUMOylated PGC-1α was detected by using anti-PGC-1α antibody. As shown is Fig. 1A, SUMOylated PGC-1α proteins in Senp1−/− MEF cells were significantly more than those in Senp1+/+ cells. The accumulation of SUMOylated PGC-1α in Senp1−/− MEF cells suggests SENP1 action as a specific protease to de-conjugate SUMOylated PGC-1α. We further observed that overexpression of SENP1, not SENP1 mutant, could de-conjugate SUMOylated PGC-1α (Fig. 1B). As SUMOylation attenuates the transcription activity of PGC-1α, we speculated that SENP1 would enhance PGC-1α activity through de-SUMOylation. To test it, we determined the role of SENP1 on transcription activity of PGC-1α by using Gal4-luciferase (G4-luc) reporter system. As expected, the titrated SENP1 expression was able to increase wild type PGC-1α activity, but could not promote any more activity of PGC-1α K183R mutant(29.Rytinki M.M. Palvimo J.J. SUMOylation attenuates the function of PGC-1α.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26184-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C and D). This suggests that the mutation of SUMOylation site can saturate PGC-1α activity. All these results reveal that SENP1 is the specific de-SUMOylation protease, which promotes PGC-1α activity by regulating the SUMOylation status of PGC-1α. PGC-1α is a master regulator for mitochondrial biogenesis and function (5.Lin J.D. Minireview: the PGC-1 coactivator networks: chromatin-remodeling and mitochondrial energy metabolism.Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12.Feige J.N. Auwerx J. Transcriptional coregulators in the control of energy homeostasis.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 292-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PGC-1α is not only a co-activator for transcriptional factors NRF, ERR, and PPAR, which control the transcription of nuclear mitochondrial genes, but also a transcription factor to regulate the expression of these transcription factors such as NRF and ERR (5.Lin J.D. Minireview: the PGC-1 coactivator networks: chromatin-remodeling and mitochondrial energy metabolism.Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12.Feige J.N. Auwerx J. Transcriptional coregulators in the control of energy homeostasis.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 292-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that SENP1 would be a regulator for the expressions of these genes through targeting PGC-1α. We first measured the mRNA level of some nuclear mitochondrial genes in Senp1+/+ and Senp1−/− MEF cells by using real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, mutation of SENP1 remarkably reduced the mRNA levels of these tested genes. We also observed the reduction of NRF and ERRα'not PPAR, in Senp1−/− MEF cells in comparison with that in Senp1+/+ cells (Fig. 2B), which would contribute to the down-regulation of mitochondrial genes. To test whether the mutation of SENP1 is responsible for the reduction of the expression of these genes, we transfected wild type SENP1 plasmid into Senp1−/− MEF cells to determine whether SENP1 could rescue the phenotypes in Senp1−/− MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, the expression of SENP1 in Senp1−/− MEF cells almost restored the mRNA expressions of mitochondrial genes to the level of wild type cells. More interestingly, the catalytic domain mutant of SENP1 did not show effects in the same system, suggesting that SENP1 and its de-SUMOylation activity are essential for the expressions of mitochondrial genes. We further investigated whether SENP1-controlled expression of mitochondrial genes was dependent on PGC-1α SUMOylation. To test that, PGC-1α wild type or PGC-1α SUMOylation mutant (29.Rytinki M.M. Palvimo J.J. SUMOylation attenuates the function of PGC-1α.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26184-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) plasmids was transfected into Senp1−/− MEF cells. This resulted in an increase of mitochondrial genes in Senp1−/− cells. More interestingly, PGC-1α mutant showed greater ability to recover the expression of mitochondrial genes than PGC-1α wild type did in Senp1−/− cells (Fig. 2D). We also observed there was no reduction of PGC-1α expression in Senp1−/− cells (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that SENP1 regulates the expression of mitochondrial genes mostly through de-SUMOylation of PGC-1α. To further determine SENP1 as a positive regulator in the expression of mitochondrial genes, we expressed exogenous SENP1 into C2C12 cells by infection of AAV-SENP1. As shown in Fig. 3, the expression of exogenous SENP1 significantly increased the expression of mitochondrial genes. However, the SENP1 mutant had no effects on the expression of these genes. These results suggest that SENP1 can promote the expression of mitochondrial genes through de-SUMOylation. The above results revealed the crucial role of SENP1 in the expression of nuclear mitochondrial genes that encode mitochondrial proteins. Thus we speculated that SENP1 would regulate the mitochondrial biogenesis. To test it, we first compared the mitochondria mass in Senp1−/− with that in Senp1+/+ MEF cells by using Mito-Tracker staining. As shown in Fig. 4A, Senp1−/− MEF cell had much less mitochondria than Senp1+/+ cells. This observation was confirmed by further analysis of mtDNA copies. It showed that the ratio of mtDNA/nDNA in Senp1−/− cells was lower than that in Senp1+/+ cells (Fig. 4B). Morphological analysis by electron microscopy further demonstrated smaller mitochondria and less cristae inside mitochondria in Senp1−/− MEF cells in comparison with that of Senp1+/+ cells (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that mutation of SENP1, like the mutation of PGC-1α, can cause defects in mitochondrial biogenesis. Since SENP1 plays an important role in mitochondrial biogenesis, we should expect that SENP1 would be essential for mitochondrial function too. To prove it, oxygen consumption, a mitochondrial respiration marker, was analyzed in Senp1+/+ and Senp1−/− MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, intact Senp1+/+ MEF cells showed normal response to Oligomycin (an inhibitor of ATP synthase), FCCP (a mitochondrial protonophore), or Rotenone (a mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase inhibitor) treatment associated with the decrease or increase of mitochondrial oxygen consumption. On the other hand, in Senp1−/− MEF cells, not only the responses to these treatments were very mild, but also the basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption and FCCP-induced mitochondrial oxidative capacity remarkably decreased in Senp1−/− cells, indicating there was mitochondrial dysfunction in Senp1−/− cells. In the meantime, a lower levels of ATP (Fig. 5B) and ROS production (Fig. 5C) were observed in Senp1−/− MEF cells in normoxia in comparison with the wild type as the result of decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and oxidative phosphorylation. To test whether SENP1-controlled mitochondrial function was dependent on PGC-1α SUMOylation, we transfected PGC-1α wild type or PGC-1α SUMOylation site mutant (29.Rytinki M.M. Palvimo J.J. SUMOylation attenuates the function of PGC-1α.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26184-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) plasmids into Senp1−/− MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 5D, PGC-1α SUMOylation site mutant could recover the ATP production more than PGC-1α wild type did in Senp1−/− MEF cells. We also determined the ATP production in exogenous SENP1-expressed C2C12 cells and showed that overexpression of SENP1 increased more ATP production than control or SENP1 mutant-expressed cells (Fig. 5E). These data reveal the crucial role of SENP1 in mitochondrial function. In summary, we have identified SENP1 as a regulator of PGC-1α activity through de-SUMOylation. By testing in Senp1−/− MEF cells and SENP1 overexpressed C2C12 cells, we have found that SENP1 is essential for the expression of nuclear mitochondrial genes through the de-SUMOylation of PGC-1α. More importantly, we have also demonstrated that SENP1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and its function. Our results reveal that PGC-1α is a major target regulated by SENP1 in regulation of the expression of mitochondrial genes (Fig. 2D). However, we still could not exclude other SENP1 targets involved in this process. For example, we detected the reduction of expression of PGC-1β, a high homologous and related protein of PGC-1α, in addition to the accumulation of SUMOylated PGC-1α in Senp1−/− MEF cells. PGC-1β is shown to be capable of activating the expression of mitochondrial genes (30.Lai L. Leone T.C. Zechner C. Schaeffer P.J. Kelly S.M. Flanagan D.P. Medeiros D.M. Kovacs A. Kelly D.P.

Thus PGC-1β may also contribute to the regulation of SENP1 in mitochondrial biogenesis, although we do not know how SENP1 regulates PGC-1β expression. Zunino et al. have shown that SENP5 can also modulate mitochondrial morphology and function (34.Zunino R. Schauss A. Rippstein P. Andrade-Navarro M. McBride H.M.

Different from SENP1, SENP5 is located in the cytosolic pool and it modulates mitochondria fission during mitosis through de-SUMOylating the dynamin-related fission GTPase DRP1(34.Zunino R.

Since the change in mitochondrial mass is crucial for cell adaptation under various conditions, and that the altered mitochondrial biogenesis leads to dysfunction and development of pathologies, to decipher regulation signaling during mitochondrial biogenesis will not only help us to better understand the development of such pathologies but also help us to discover potential targets for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1480236339,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) is produced by the consecutive cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) first by β-secretase, generating C99, and then by γ-secretase. APP is also cleaved by α-secretase. It is hypothesized that reducing the production of Aβ in the brain may slow the progression of Alzheimer disease. Therefore, different γ-secretase inhibitors have been developed to reduce Aβ production. Paradoxically, it has been shown that low to moderate inhibitor concentrations cause a rise in Aβ production in different cell lines, in different animal models, and also in humans. A mechanistic understanding of the Aβ rise remains elusive. Here, a minimal mathematical model has been developed that quantitatively describes the Aβ dynamics in cell lines that exhibit the rise as well as in cell lines that do not. The model includes steps of APP processing through both the so-called amyloidogenic pathway and the so-called non-amyloidogenic pathway. It is shown that the cross-talk between these two pathways accounts for the increase in Aβ production in response to inhibitor, i.e. an increase in C99 will inhibit the non-amyloidogenic pathway, redirecting APP to be cleaved by β-secretase, leading to an additional increase in C99 that overcomes the loss in γ-secretase activity. With a minor extension, the model also describes plasma Aβ profiles observed in humans upon dosing with a γ-secretase inhibitor. In conclusion, this mechanistic model rationalizes a series of experimental results that spans from in vitro to in vivo and to humans. This has important implications for the development of drugs targeting Aβ production in Alzheimer disease."

https://openalex.org/W2011459847,"The peripheral dopaminergic system plays a crucial role in blood pressure regulation through its actions on renal hemodynamics and epithelial ion transport. The dopamine D5 receptor (D(5)R) interacts with sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), a protein involved in receptor retrieval from the trans-Golgi network. In this report, we elucidated the spatial, temporal, and functional significance of this interaction in human renal proximal tubule cells and HEK293 cells stably expressing human D(5)R and in mice. Silencing of SNX1 expression via RNAi resulted in the failure of D(5)R to internalize and bind GTP, blunting of the agonist-induced increase in cAMP production and decrease in sodium transport, and up-regulation of angiotensin II receptor expression, of which expression was previously shown to be negatively regulated by D(5)R. Moreover, siRNA-mediated depletion of renal SNX1 in C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice resulted in increased blood pressure and blunted natriuretic response to agonist in salt-loaded BALB/cJ mice. These data demonstrate a crucial role for SNX1 in D(5)R trafficking and that SNX1 depletion results in D(5)R dysfunction and thus may represent a novel mechanism for the pathogenesis of essential hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2072745964,"The Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (GSSA) and its variants are cornerstone techniques to simulate reaction kinetics in situations where the concentration of the reactant is too low to allow deterministic techniques such as differential equations. The inherent limitations of the GSSA include the time required for executing a single run and the need for multiple runs for parameter sweep exercises due to the stochastic nature of the simulation. Even very efficient variants of GSSA are prohibitively expensive to compute and perform parameter sweeps. Here we present a novel variant of the exact GSSA that is amenable to acceleration by using graphics processing units (GPUs). We parallelize the execution of a single realization across threads in a warp (fine-grained parallelism). A warp is a collection of threads that are executed synchronously on a single multi-processor. Warps executing in parallel on different multi-processors (coarse-grained parallelism) simultaneously generate multiple trajectories. Novel data-structures and algorithms reduce memory traffic, which is the bottleneck in computing the GSSA. Our benchmarks show an 8×−120× performance gain over various state-of-the-art serial algorithms when simulating different types of models."
https://openalex.org/W2065063734,"Studies exploring the ecological interactions between avian influenza viruses (AIV), natural hosts and the environment are scarce. Most work has focused on viral survival and transmission under laboratory conditions and through mathematical modelling. However, more integrated studies performed under field conditions are required to validate these results. In this study, we combined information on bird community, environmental factors and viral epidemiology to assess the contribution of biotic and abiotic factors in the occurrence of low pathogenic AIV in Spanish wetlands. For that purpose, seven locations in five different wetlands were studied during two years (2007-2009), including seven sampling visits by location. In each survey, fresh faeces (n = 4578) of wild birds and water samples were collected for viral detection. Also, the vegetation structure, water physical properties of wetlands, climatic conditions and wild bird community composition were determined. An overall AIV prevalence of 1.7%±0.4 was detected in faecal samples with important fluctuations among seasons and locations. Twenty-six AIV were isolated from the 78 RRT-PCR positive samples and eight different haemagglutinines and five neuraminidases were identified, being the combination H3N8 the most frequent. Variation partitioning procedures identified the combination of space and time variables as the most important pure factor - independently to other factors - explaining the variation in AIV prevalence (36.8%), followed by meteorological factor (21.5%) and wild bird community composition/vegetation structure (21.1%). These results contribute to the understanding of AIV ecological drivers in Spanish ecosystems and provide useful guidelines for AIV risk assessment identifying potential hotspots of AIV activity."
https://openalex.org/W1964623655,"Predators may affect prey population growth and community diversity through density mediated lethal and trait mediated non-lethal effects that influence phenotypic traits of prey. We tested experimentally the roles of thinning the density of prey (lethality) in the absence of predator cues and density and trait mediated effects (lethality + intimidation) of predatory midge Corethrella appendiculata on competing native and invasive mosquito prey. Predator-mediated reductions in prey and density reductions in the absence of C. appendiculata resulted in lower percent survivorship to adulthood and estimates of the finite rate of increase (λ') for invasive mosquito Aedes albopictus relative to that of controls. In most instances, thinning the density of prey in the absence, but not in the presence, of C. appendiculata cues resulted in lower survivorship to adulthood and λ' for native mosquito Aedes triseriatus relative to that of controls. Together, these results suggested trait mediated effects of C. appendiculata specific to each species of mosquito prey. Release from intraspecific competition attributable to density reductions in the absence, but not in the presence, of C. appendiculata enhanced growth and lengthened adult lifespan relative to that of controls for A. albopictus but not A. triseriatus. These results show the importance of predator-mediated density and trait mediated effects on phenotypic traits and populations of invasive and native mosquitoes. Species-specific differences in the phenotypic responses of prey may be due, in part, to longer evolutionary history of C. appendiculata with A. triseriatus than A. albopictus."
https://openalex.org/W1998907630,"BST-2/CD317/tetherin is a host factor that inhibits HIV-1 release and is counteracted by HIV-1 Vpu. Structural studies indicate that the BST-2 ectodomain assumes a coiled-coil conformation. Here we studied the role of the BST-2 ectodomain for tethering function. First, we addressed the importance of the length and structure of the ectodomain by adding or substituting heterologous coiled-coil or non-coiled-coil sequences. We found that extending or replacing the BST-2 ectodomain using non-coiled-coil sequences resulted in loss of BST-2 function. Doubling the size of the BST-2 ectodomain by insertion of a heterologous coiled-coil motif or substituting the BST-2 coiled-coil domain with a heterologous coiled-coil motif maintained tethering function. Reductions in the size of the BST-2 coiled-coil domain were tolerated as well. In fact, deletion of the C-terminal half of the BST-2 ectodomain, including a series of seven consecutive heptad motifs did not abolish tethering function. However, slight changes in the positioning of deletions affecting the relative placing of charged or hydrophobic residues on the helix severely impacted the functional properties of BST-2. Overall, we conclude that the size of the BST-2 ectodomain is highly flexible and can be reduced or extended as long as the positioning of residues important for the stability of the dimer interface is maintained. BST-2/CD317/tetherin is a host factor that inhibits HIV-1 release and is counteracted by HIV-1 Vpu. Structural studies indicate that the BST-2 ectodomain assumes a coiled-coil conformation. Here we studied the role of the BST-2 ectodomain for tethering function. First, we addressed the importance of the length and structure of the ectodomain by adding or substituting heterologous coiled-coil or non-coiled-coil sequences. We found that extending or replacing the BST-2 ectodomain using non-coiled-coil sequences resulted in loss of BST-2 function.

BST-2 can be neutralized by three different lentiviral proteins: HIV-1 employs Vpu, HIV-2 uses its Env glycoprotein, and SIV uses Nef.

A current model suggests that BST-2 tethers mature virions to the cell surface by means of its N-terminal TM region and C-terminal domain.

Curiously, the distance between these structures frequently exceeded the 17-nm limit imposed by the BST-2 ectodomain, a phenomenon that has remained unexplained. Interestingly, Perez-Caballero et al. (30.Perez-Caballero D. Zang T. Ebrahimi A. McNatt M.W. Gregory D.A. Johnson M.C. Bieniasz P.D. Tetherin inhibits HIV-1 release by directly tethering virions to cells.Cell. 2009; 139: 499-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) demonstrated that an artificial tetherin consisting of the N-terminal TM region of transferrin receptor, a coiled-coil ectodomain of the cytoplasmic dimeric protein dystrophia myotonica protein kinase, and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor signal derived from urokinase plasminogen activator receptor is capable of inhibiting the release of HIV-1 virions tethered to the cell surface. This suggests that the secondary structure rather than the primary amino acid sequence of BST-2 is important for tethering function. This conclusion is confirmed by a recent study demonstrating that replacement of four consecutive residues by alanines is well tolerated across much of the BST-2 ectodomain (39.Hammonds J. Ding L. Chu H. Geller K. Robbins A. Wang J.J. Yi H. Spearman P. The tetherin/BST-2 coiled-coil ectodomain mediates plasma membrane microdomain localization and restriction of particle release.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 2259-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The goal of the current study was to gain additional insights into the role of the BST-2 ectodomain for tethering function. Our approach was two-pronged. First, we assessed the importance of the length and structure of the ectodomain by adding or substituting heterologous coiled-coil or non-coiled-coil sequences in the BST-2 ectodomain. Second, we introduced in-frame deletions at various positions and of various sizes to identify the minimum size of the BST-2 ectodomain. Results from our first approach revealed that extending or substituting the BST-2 ectodomain using non-coiled-coil sequences derived from the CD4 ectodomain inhibited BST-2 function. In contrast, substituting the BST-2 coiled-coil domain with a heterologous coiled-coil motif derived from vimentin maintained the tethering function, consistent with previous results involving artificial tetherin. Interestingly, addition of the vimentin coiled-coil to the existing BST-2 structure, which almost doubled the size of the BST-2 ectodomain, remained functional. These results suggest that there is significant tolerance with respect to increasing the length of the ectodomain. Results from our second approach revealed that much of the BST-2 ectodomain can be deleted without loss of function. Indeed, we found that approximately half of the ectodomain, including a series of seven consecutive heptad motifs, could be deleted without losing tethering function. Interestingly, the positioning of the deletions within the ectodomain was critical for BST-2 function. Utilizing molecular modeling, we found that the orientation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues along the dimer interface in the C-terminal part of BST-2 was critical for function. Overall, we conclude that the size of the BST-2 ectodomain can be reduced or enlarged with heterologous coiled-coil sequences, revealing a significant flexibility in the overall size of the protein, whereas changes to the heptad motifs or the register of the coil had variable effects depending on the positioning of the deletion.

HA-tagged BST-2 encoding a triple HA epitope tag in the ectodomain following BST-2 residue 148 (BST-2I) was constructed using PCR-based methodologies as described (24.Andrew A.J. Kao S. Strebel K.

In pcDNA-BST-2-rCD4 residues, Lys106-Ile148 of BST-2I were removed and replaced by domain 3 of the ectodomain of human CD4 (residues Phe204-Met317). In pcDNA-BST-2-rCC1 and pcDNA-BST-2-rCC2, residues Lys106-Ile148 of BST-2I were replaced by vimentin residues Glu300-Asn388 or Arg122-Ser299, respectively, which were predicted to form coiled-coils using COILS predictor software (42.Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Predicting coiled coils from protein sequences.Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Insertions were made after residue Ile148 with the same portions of either CD4 (iCD4) or vimentin (iCC1 and iCC2). Deletions within BST-2I include Δ51–80 (residues Glu51-Gly80), Δ51–88 (residues Glu51-Ala88), Δ96–116 (residues Met96-Leu116), Δ96–127 (residues Met96-Leu127), Δ131–148 (residues Ser131-Ile148), Δ97–147 (residues Ala97-Arg147), Δ96–118 (residues Met96-Gly118), Δ55–87 (residues Asp55-Gln87), Δ81–94 (residues Phe81-Thr94), and Δ95–146 (residues Val95-Val146).

HA-specific mouse monoclonal antibody was from Roche Diagnostics. HeLa and 293T cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HeLa TZM-bl cells were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH (donated by Dr. John C. Kappes, Dr. Xiaoyun Wu, and Tranzyme Inc.) and propagated in DMEM. For transfection, cells were grown in 25-cm2 flasks to about 80% confluence. Cells were transfected using TransIT®-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI) or Lipofectamine PLUSTM (Invitrogen Corp.) following the manufacturer's recommendations. A total of 5 μg of plasmid DNA per 25-cm2 flask was used. Total amounts of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding empty vector DNA as appropriate. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. Virus stocks were prepared by transfection of 293T cells with the indicated plasmid DNAs. Virus-containing supernatants were harvested 24 h after transfection. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (3 min, 1,500 × g) and clarified supernatants were filtered (0.45 μm) to remove residual cellular debris. 100 μl of viral stock was used to infect 5 × 104 TZM-bl cells in a 24-well plate in a total volume of 1.1 ml. Infection was allowed for 48 h at 37 °C. Media was removed and cells were lysed in 300 μl of Promega 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and frozen at −80 °C for a minimum of 30 min. To determine the luciferase activity in the lysates, 5 μl of each lysate were combined with 20 μl of luciferase substrate (Steady-Glo; Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and light emission was measured using a Modulus ii microplate reader (Turner Biosystems Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).

https://openalex.org/W2080890436,"In this paper, we propose a depth propagation scheme based on optical flow field rectification towards more accurate depth reconstruction. In depth reconstruction, the occlusions and low-textural regions easily result in optical flow field errors, which lead ambiguous depth value or holes without depth in the obtained depth map. In this work, a scheme is proposed to improve the precision of depth propagation and the quality of depth reconstruction for dynamic scene. The proposed scheme first adaptively detects the occlusive or low-textural regions, and the obtained vectors in optical flow field are rectified properly. Subsequently, we process the occluded and ambiguous vectors for more precise depth propagation. We further leverage the boundary enhancement filters as a post-processing to sharpen the object boundaries in obtained depth maps for better quality. Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed scheme can reconstruct depth map with higher accuracy and better quality compared with the state-of-the-art methods."

So far, no structures have been reported for the Psu protein or its homologues.

Each monomer of Psu attains a novel fold around a tight coiled-coil motif. CD spectroscopy and the structure of an engineered disulfide-bridged Psu derivative reveal that the protein folds reversibly and reassembles by itself into the knotted dimeric conformation without the requirement of any chaperone.

This structure would help to explain the functional properties of the protein and can be used as a template to design a minimal peptide fragment that can be used as a drug against Rho-dependent transcription termination in bacteria. Factor-dependent transcription termination in bacteria is mediated by a hexameric RNA-dependent ATPase protein, Rho (1.Richardson J.P. Greenblatt J. Control of RNA chain elongation and termination.in: Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C1996: 822-848Google Scholar). This mode of transcription termination causes polarity in gene expression pattern. Psu, a polarity suppression protein, is the first reported antiterminator of Rho-specific transcription termination in bacteria, which also acts as a capsid decoration protein in bacteriophage P4 (2.Linderoth N.A. Calendar R. The Psu protein from bacteriophage P4 is an antitermination factor for rho-dependent transcription termination.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6722-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Isaksen M.L. Rishovd S.T. Calendar R. Lindqvist B.H. The polarity suppression factor of bacteriophage P4 is also a decoration protein of the P4 capsid.Virology. 1992; 188: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Protein moonlighting is a phenomenon in which a protein can perform more than one function. So, Psu can be categorized as a moonlighting protein due to its dual activities. Upon binding to the Rho hexamer, Psu reduces the ATPase activity of Rho without affecting its primary RNA binding activities (4.Pani B. Banerjee S. Chalissery J. Muralimohan A. Abishek M. Loganathan R.M. Suganthan R.B. Sen R. Mechanism of inhibition of Rho-dependent transcription termination by bacteriophage P4 protein Psu.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26491-26500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Psu interacts with P4 phage capsid protein and stabilizes P4 against heat treatment (5.Dokland T. Isaksen M.L. Fuller S.D. Lindqvist B.H. Capsid localization of the bacteriophage P4 Psu protein.Virology. 1993; 194: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the relation between the heat stabilization by Psu and its polarity suppression, if any, is yet to be established. Circular dichroism studies demonstrate that Psu is predominantly an α-helical protein and size exclusion chromatography along with in vitro cross-linking experiments reveal that Psu exists as a dimer in solution (4.Pani B. Banerjee S. Chalissery J. Muralimohan A. Abishek M. Loganathan R.M. Suganthan R.B. Sen R. Mechanism of inhibition of Rho-dependent transcription termination by bacteriophage P4 protein Psu.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26491-26500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Extensive mutational and cross-linking studies suggests that the interaction of Psu with Rho is direct and specific, mediated by the C-terminal tail of Psu, whereas the N-terminal domain of Psu maintains the conformational integrity of the C-terminal tail (6.Pani B. Ranjan A. Sen R. Interaction surface of bacteriophage P4 protein Psu required for the complex formation with the transcription terminator Rho.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the atomic structure of Psu, its domain organization and assembly remains unknown. Here, we report the first structure of Psu (21 kDa) consisting of a symmetric “V”-shaped homodimer. The striking feature of the dimeric interface is that it incorporates a significant portion of the polypeptide chain in a knotted conformation, which is extensive and exclusively hydrophobic in nature. Each monomer of Psu attains a novel protein fold with a long N-terminal coiled-coil motif wrapped by the C-terminal helices, whereas the central region self assembles into the knot with another monomer to form the dimer. We have validated the existence of this knotted dimeric conformation of Psu in solution by solving the structure of T123C mutant on no-Cys construct of Psu (T123C-ΔCys-Psu). 4The abbreviations used are:T123C-ΔCys-PsuT123C mutant on no-Cys variant of PsuGdmClguanidine hydrochloride. In this mutant structure, Cys-123 from each monomer faces each other at the dimeric interface and forms a disulfide bridge under oxidizing condition. We have also demonstrated that the denatured Psu can self assemble into the knot spontaneously in solution. Furthermore, the knotted V-shaped architecture of the Psu dimer, with its inherent tensile properties makes Psu suitable to interact with the hexameric capsomere on phage capsid to block DNA leakage. T123C mutant on no-Cys variant of Psu guanidine hydrochloride. The wild type Psu protein was expressed and purified by a three-step process involving a 25% ammonium sulfate precipitation in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol followed by purification through Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and CM Sepharose columns (GE Healthcare). Psu was eluted between 50 and 150 mm NaCl, and the eluted fractions were stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl. This procedure yielded ∼95% pure protein. For the preparation of the T123C-ΔCys-Psu mutant, a zero-Cys Psu (ΔCys-Psu) was prepared by mutating all the cysteines (Cys-13 and Cys-117) to serine. The T123C change was made by site-directed mutagenesis on the ΔCys-Psu and was purified in a similar way as WT. The crystallization trials of Psu was carried out at 277 and 293 K. Typically, 3 ml of protein solution (5 mg/ml) was mixed with 2 ml of reservoir solution containing 7.5%(w/v) PEG 6000, 5%(v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, and 300 mm NaCl in 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, at 277 K. Cube-shaped crystals appeared after 7 days. For phasing, the crystals of Psu were soaked in 2 mm HgI2 in the reservoir solution for 2 h. X-ray data were collected in-house at 100 K using a MAR Research image-plate detector of diameter 345 mm and Cu,K α radiation (1.54 Å) generated by a Bruker-Nonius FR591 rotating-anode generator equipped with Osmic MaxFlux confocal optics and running at 50 kV and 90 mA. A total of 129 frames were collected with a crystal-to-detector distance of 210 mm. The exposure time for each image was 4 min, and the oscillation range was maintained at 1 degree. The data were integrated with imosflm (7.Battye T.G. Kontogiannis L. Johnson O. Powell H.R.

The density was modified after defining the protein region of the density maps as the regions with the highest local root mean square deviations with Resolve in Phenix Autosol, which produced a readily interpretable map.

For crystallization of Psu T123C, the protein was dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH. 8.0), 300 mm NaCl. The crystallization trials of Psu was carried out at 277 and 293 K.

Cube-shaped crystals appeared within a couple of days. Data were collected up to 3 Å in conditions similar to the WT Psu.

The oligomeric state of the protein was analyzed using the PISA web server (15.Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol.

NOMAD-Ref: visualization, deformation and refinement of macromolecular structures based on all-atom normal mode analysis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W52-W56Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) using the elastic network model and default settings for the other parameters. Briefly, all atoms were taken for the analysis of total 16 modes with a cut-off value of 10 Å for mode calculation and 5 Å as elastic constant. Far-UV CD spectra were acquired for protein concentrations of 1 mg/ml (0.047 mm) in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) at 25 °C using a BioLogic Science Instruments (France) spectropolarimeter and cuvettes of 1-mm path length. For denaturation studies, the protein was incubated in varying concentrations of guanidine chloride (GdmCl; 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 m) at 25 °C. The protein was initially standardized for the minimum GdmCl concentration at which denaturation reaches saturation. Initial denaturation with 6, 5, 4, and 3 m gave the same CD profiles. So, maximum of 3 m GdmCl was used for performing the denaturation experiments to minimize the noise in the 200–210 nm range. The far-UV CD spectrum of each sample was acquired after 20 min of incubation. Each spectrum was recorded as an average of eight scans. In all experiments, contributions of the buffer to the spectra were subtracted, and mean residue ellipticities were determined before plotting the spectra. For renaturation studies of Psu WT and Psu T123C, the proteins at a concentration of 2 mg/ml (0.095 mm) and 1.7 mg/ml (0.08 mm), respectively, were first denatured in a reaction mixture containing 3 m GdmCl and then subsequently dialyzed against buffer without GdmCl. Steady state fluorescence studies were performed using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer for protein concentrations of 1 mg/ml (0.047) in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) at 25 °C and cuvettes of 4-mm path length. For denaturation studies, the protein was incubated in varying concentrations of GdmCl (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 m) at 25 °C for 20 min each. Fluorescence emission from Psu tryptophans were measured using an excitation at 295 nm, and the emitted intensity was recorded at 340 nm. In all experiments, contributions of the buffer to the spectra were subtracted before plotting the spectra. For the cross-linking experiments, T123C-ΔCys-Psu was incubated with the copper phenanthroline (18.Belogurov G.A. Vassylyeva M.N. Svetlov V. Klyuyev S. Grishin N.V. Vassylyev D.G. Artsimovitch I. Structural basis for converting a general transcription factor into an operon-specific virulence regulator.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) before crystallization to induce disulfide bond between the two cysteines. The disulfide bridge can be formed in the presence of copper phenanthroline only if they are quite close to each other (∼6 Å) in the tertiary/quaternary structure and are correctly oriented. The concentrations of the cross-linker and T123C-ΔCys-Psu were 5 mm and 80 μm, respectively. T123C-ΔCys-Psu and copper phenanthroline were mixed in phosphate buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) devoid of any reducing agents, and incubation was continued for 30 min at 25 °C. Non-reducing SDS sample buffer was added to the cross-linking reactions, which were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide gel). The structure of Psu was solved by mercury single wavelength anomalous dispersion method at 2.04 Å (Table 1). Psu crystallizes as a dimer where each asymmetric unit accommodates one Psu monomer. The refined model of Psu includes 187 of 190 residues with unambiguous electron density (data not shown) and excellent stereochemistry (Table 1). Psu monomer adopts a “golf stick” like structure and is characterized by seven helices (α1–α7) (Fig. 1a). The N-terminal motif consists of two long antiparallel helices (“CC stem” having α1 and α2), followed by two helices involved in the dimerization (“DR knot;” α3 and α4), and finally a flexible C-terminal tail comprising three helices (“CT belt;” α5–α7), which folds back and interacts with the N-terminal helices. The polypeptide chain (135–147) that connects the helix α4 and the CT belt is oriented in a fashion such that it leaves a hole in the monomeric structure (Fig. 1a). A search of the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server (19.Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar) and PDBeFold (20.Krissinel E. Henrick K. Secondary-structure matching (PDBeFold), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3160) Google Scholar) did not produce any significant match with the Psu structure designating it to be a new fold. The CC stem is composed of two long antiparallel helices, α1 (residues 3–39) and α2 (residues 45–91) connected by an inverse γ turn (residues 43–45) (Fig. 1a). Helices α1 and α2 form a two stranded antiparallel coiled-coil motif with five consecutive heptad repeats of amino acid residues, with the heptad positions “abcdefg” (Fig. 1b) bearing the signature of coiled-coil motifs (hxxhcxc; where “h” designates hydrophobic residues and “c” charged residues). Heptad repeat of hydrophobic residues at position “a,” hallmark of a coiled-coil motif, are observed at Leu-6, Cys-13, Trp-20, Leu-27, Tyr-34 positions of the helix α1 and at Leu-48, Ile-55, Val-62, Tyr-69, Val-76 positions of the helix α2 (Fig. 1, b and c). At the interface of the two helices, hydrophobic residues at position a of one helix lines up with the residues at position d of the other helix to form a hydrophobic core that stabilizes the coiled-coil structure (Fig. 1, b and c). Some variations are observed with respect to the proper positioning of the hydrophobic amino acids at a or d and the polar amino acids at e or g. Interestingly, these variations are used to further stabilize the coiled-coil either through formation of polar contacts or formation of salt bridge interactions. Polar/charged residues at a or d packs their hydrophobic portion in the core of the coiled-coil (Fig. 1d). For example, polar side chain of Asn-16 (d) forms hydrogen bond with Ser-72 (d) (Fig. 1d) at one end of the coiled-coil. At the middle of the motif, two positively charged residues, Arg-23 (d) and Arg-58 (d) come close to each other, and this destabilization is converted to a favorable one through salt bridge interactions by Glu-26 (e) and Gln-61 (e) (Fig. 1d). Near the inverse γ turn connector between α1 and α2, Arg-47 (e) and Arg-36 (c) make strong salt bridge interactions with Glu-33 (e) (Fig. 1d). Apart from these, there are additional violations in amino acid type, and these are engaged to make specific interactions with the CT belt residues during wrapping the coiled-coil (Fig. 1, e and f). The C-terminal helices α5, α6, and α7 wraps the CC stem similar to a belt (Fig. 1a). During wrapping, amino acids from the CT belt makes several ionic and “knob/hole” type hydrophobic interactions with the amino acids from CC-stem. Asp-146 of helix α5 strongly interacts with Arg-84 and Ser-80 of α2, whereas residues Ile-149, Thr-152, and Ile-153 make a hydrophobic hole to pack Phe-10 (e) of α1 (Fig. 1e). Leu-150 and Ile-153 of α5 form a proper hole to accommodate the side chain of Val-76. Pro-157 is nicely packed with the amino acids from both helix α1 (Cys-13) and helix α2 (Val-76, Ile-70, and Tyr-69) (Fig. 1e). Asp-164 of α6 makes strong interactions with Lys-24 and Trp-20 of α1 (Fig. 1e). Phe-177 and Phe-169 of α7 produce an environment suitable to pack Trp-60 (f) of α2 (Fig. 1f), whereas N174 of α7 forms H-bonds with Trp-60 and Gln-64 (Fig. 1f). Leu-184 fits properly between Ile-54 (e), Leu-57 (c), and Arg-58 (d) (Fig. 1f). Arg-187 near the end of helix α7 makes a salt bridge with Glu-50 (c) of α2 (Fig. 1f). All of these interactions therefore not only reinforce the C-terminal belt in the stabilization of the coiled-coil domain but also clamp the CT belt tightly with the CC stem. Crystal structure of Psu demonstrates a symmetric V-shaped homodimer, which is depicted in three different orientations (Fig. 2, a–c). The striking feature of this dimer is that the two monomers are knotted, which is shown schematically in Fig. 2d. This knotted dimeric self-assembly recruits part of α2, helices α3–α4, and the long loop connecting α4 to α5 from both monomers, which are related by a 2-fold at the dimeric interface. As mentioned earlier, there is a hole in the monomeric Psu structure (Figs. 1a and 2f), and during dimerization, α3 of one monomer passes through the hole of the other (Fig. 2f). In fact, the helix α2 needs to take a sharp turn of ∼80° at Gly-93 to project the short helix α3, ending at Pro-102, through the hole. At this turning point, Gly-93 faces the bulky side chain of the conserved Trp-133 of its knotting partner. Interestingly, α3 bears a stretch of highly conserved residues GXXLAAALAP in Psu homologues (Fig. 3). The region beyond Pro-102 is a short loop followed by helix α4, which is disposed in an antiparallel fashion to the α4 of the other monomer at an intersecting angle of ∼45°. The loop connecting α4 to α5 encompasses α3 of the knotting partner, and finally the CT belt wraps its own CC stem (Fig. 2f). During this process, a dimeric knot is formed that incorporates ∼25% of the polypeptide chain from each monomer. The knotted interface is devoid of any water molecule and harbors exclusively hydrophobic environment with several residues from α2, α3, and α4 (Fig. 4a). At the interface, Thr-123 lies in close proximity to the Thr-123 of its knotting partner with the 2-fold symmetry axis present in between (Fig. 2f). Presence of this 2-fold symmetry is also evident from Fig. 4a. There are only two hydrogen bonds from each monomer within this huge interface. The dimeric self assembly of Psu is also supported by PISA (15.Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6818) Google Scholar), whereupon dimer formation, each monomer buries ∼5500 Å2 surface area with a ΔGdiss value of 39 Kcal/mol. Average B-factors and normal mode analysis for the residues indicates that the knotted region is more stable than the CT belt (Fig. 4, b and c).FIGURE 3Sequence alignment of Psu with its homologues.

Thr-123 is located at a concave surface of Psu and just by simple association of the monomers, two Thr-123 residues cannot come in close proximity. But at the knotted dimeric interface, Thr-123 of one monomer lies in close proximity to Thr-123 of the other monomer and their side chains face each other (Fig. 2f). We reasoned that if the same dimer is formed in solution for T123C-ΔCys-Psu, then Cys-123 of the two monomers would come close in the quaternary structure and facilitate the formation of a disulfide bond. His-89 also comes close to its knotted counterpart, but His→Cys mutation may disrupt other interactions at the dimeric interface, which might be important for the dimer stability. The crystal structure of copper phenanthroline treated T23C-ΔCys-Psu showed that Cys-123 adopts two conformations of equal population, and one is able to form the disulfide bridge, validating the formation of the dimer in solution (Fig. 4d). Copper phenanthroline-treated T123C-ΔCys-Psu shows the same distribution (50% each) of the disulfide-bonded and reduced form in solution (Fig. 4d, lane 2). T123C-ΔCys-Psu dimer superposes with the Psu dimer with a root mean square deviation of 0.2 Å, implying that engineering a disulfide bond at the knotted interface does not require significant structural changes. A 45 Å electron micrograph reconstruction of the P4 phage capsid demonstrated that 12 pentameric and 30 hexameric capsomeres are arranged on a T = 4 lattice (Fig. 4e, top) (3.Isaksen M.L.

Nearly six thousands respiratory specimens were collected from patients with influenza-like illness within the framework of the Italian Influenza Surveillance Network, and the A(H1N1)pdm09 hemagglutinin (HA) gene was amplified and directly sequenced from 227 of these. Phylodynamic and phylogeographical analyses were made using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, and codon-specific positive selection acting on the HA coding sequence was evaluated. The global and local phylogenetic analyses showed that all of the Italian sequences sampled in the post-pandemic (2010/2011) season grouped into at least four highly significant Italian clades, whereas those of the pandemic season (2009/2010) were interspersed with isolates from other countries at the tree root. The time of the most recent common ancestor of the strains circulating in the pandemic season in Italy was estimated to be between the spring and summer of 2009, whereas the Italian clades of the post-pandemic season originated in the spring of 2010 and showed radiation in the summer/autumn of the same year; this was confirmed by a Bayesian skyline plot showing the biphasic growth of the effective number of infections. The local phylogeography analysis showed that the first season of infection originated in Northern Italian localities with high density populations, whereas the second involved less densely populated localities, in line with a gravity-like model of geographical dispersion. Two HA sites, codons 97 and 222, were under positive selection. In conclusion, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was introduced into Italy in the spring of 2009 by means of multiple importations. This was followed by repeated founder effects in the post-pandemic period that originated specific Italian clades."

Although multiple regulators at different layers of the receptor-effectors axis have been identified, the mechanisms of homeostatic BMP signaling remain vague. Herein we demonstrated that myotubularin-related protein 4 (MTMR4), a FYVE domain-containing dual-specificity protein phosphatase (DUSP), preferentially associated with and dephosphorylated the activated R-Smads in cytoplasm, which is a critical checkpoint in BMP signal transduction. Therefore, transcriptional activation by BMPs was tightly controlled by the expression level and the intrinsic phosphatase activity of MTMR4. More profoundly, ectopic expression of MTMR4 or its Drosophila homolog CG3632 genetically interacted with BMP/Dpp signaling axis in regulation of the vein development of Drosophila wings. By doing so, MTMR4 could interact with and dephosphorylate Mothers against Decapentaplegic (Mad), the sole R-Smad in Drosophila BMP pathway, and hence affected the target genes expression of Mad.

After binding to BMPs, the serine-threonine kinase transmembrane receptors activate a signal cascade through intracellular regulatory Smad proteins (R-Smads). Phosphorylated R-Smads form a ternary complex with the common partner Smad (Co-Smad) and translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription of a spectrum of effector genes (8Miyazono K. Maeda S. Imamura T. BMP receptor signaling: transcriptional targets, regulation of signals, and signaling cross-talk.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). There are two members of BMPs in Drosophila. Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is the homolog of BMP2/4 (9Padgett R.W. St Johnston R.D. Gelbart W.M.

Dpp receptors are autonomously required for cell proliferation in the entire developing Drosophila wing.Development. 1996; 122: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and are required for the vein formation (12Sturtevant M.A. Bier E.

However, the existence and roles of cytoplasmic phosphatases have remained elusive; it has been recently revealed by us that a new endosomal phosphatase, myotubularin-related protein 4 (MTMR4), can specifically temper TGFβ signaling (22Yu J.

MTMR4 belongs to myotubularin family and contains tyrosine/dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) activity (23Laporte J. Bedez F. Bolino A. Mandel J.L.

MTMR4 specifically interacts with and dephosphorylates the activated R-Smads to keep TGFβ signaling in homeostasis (22Yu J. Pan L. Qin X. Chen H. Xu Y. Chen Y. Tang H.

It therefore would be highly interesting to determine whether MTMR4 is also critically involved in BMP signaling. In this study, we managed to demonstrate that MTMR4 is also an essential negative regulator of BMP signaling pathway. MTMR4 directly bound to and dephosphorylated the activated Smad1 via the DUSP enzymatic domain. Thus, overexpression of MTMR4 inhibited BMP-induced gene expression by accelerating Smad1 dephosphorylation, whereas knockdown of MTMR4 by siRNA enhanced BMP signaling with sustained Smad1 phosphorylation. We further demonstrated in vivo that MTMR4 and its Drosophila homologous gene CG3632 critically modulated the vein formation of Drosophila wings, by specifically targeting Mad activation. Therefore, MTMR4 may possess a conserved attenuator activity on R-Smads activation that is required for homeostatic BMP/Dpp signaling. Expression of plasmids for YFP-tagged MTMR4 and its truncations/point mutation (MTMR4C407S) has been previously described (22Yu J. Pan L. Qin X. Chen H. Xu Y. Chen Y. Tang H.

Different plasmid constructs were injected into w1118 embryos to generate transgenic lines. To determine whether a moderate reduction of BMP signaling and overexpression of MTMR4 has any effect on Drosophila wing patterning, the vg-gal4 virgins were crossed with UAS-tkvRNAi (II), UAS-tkv RNAi (III), UAS-CG3632, UAS-MTMR4, UAS- MTMR4C407S, and w1118 males. To investigate how gbb overexpression affects wing pattern formation, the vg-gal4 virgins were crossed with UAS-gbb males. To test whether MTMR4, MTMR4-C407S could interfere with BMP signaling, the vg-gal4 virgins were crossed with UAS-CG3632/Cyo;UAS-tkvRNAi(III)/TM6, UAS-MTMR4/Cyo;UAS-tkvRNAi(III)/TM6, UAS-MTMR4C407S/Cyo;UAS-tkvRNAi(III)/TM6, UAS-gbb/FM7;UAS-CG3632/Cyo, UAS-gbb/FM7;UAS-MTMR4/Cyo, UAS-gbb/FM7;UAS-MTMR4C407S/Cyo males. All wings demonstrated here are from adult females and were mounted in Hoyer's medium. Because BMP and TGFβ both belong to TGFβ superfamily, that MTMR4 attenuates R-Smads activation in TGFβ pathway (22Yu J. Pan L. Qin X. Chen H. Xu Y. Chen Y. Tang H. MTMR4 attenuates transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling by dephosphorylating R-Smads in endosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 8454-8462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) prompted us to test whether the conserved DUSP activity of MTMR4 would also play a role in BMP signaling. To test this hypothesis, first we transiently transfected two BMP-responsive luciferase reporters in HeLa cells, namely BRE-lux and GCCG-lux which contained multiple BMP-specific R-Smads binding elements GCCG (25Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Characterization of a bone morphogenetic protein-responsive Smad-binding element.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 29Monteiro R.M. de Sousa Lopes S.M. Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. Mummery C.L. Spatio-temporal activation of Smad1 and Smad5 in vivo: monitoring transcriptional activity of Smad proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4653-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The R-Smad responsive reporter activities increased by ∼2.5-fold post-BMP2 treatment for 16 h, which was effectively suppressed by co-expressed MTMR4 (Fig. 1, A and B; supplemental Fig. S1A for expression levels of MTMR4 in transfectants). This result thus suggested that MTMR4 plays an inhibitory role in BMP signaling. Moreover, when we knocked down the endogenous MTMR4 gene expression by siRNA (supplemental Fig. S1B for the knockdown efficiency), as expected, cells became more responsive to BMP2, as demonstrated by much higher BRE/GCCG reporter activities than those treated with scrambled RNAi (Fig. 1, C and D). Therefore, MTMR4 would be required to attenuate BMP signaling. To substantiate this notion, we went on to further test whether MTMR4 affects the expression of BMP target genes. For this purpose, we examine the transcriptional levels of Id-1, a regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation (26Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. Identification and functional characterization of distinct critically important bone morphogenetic protein-specific response elements in the Id1 promoter.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 30Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. Id: a target of BMP signaling.Sci STKE. 2002; 2002: pe40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and p21, a cell cycle inhibitor (31Pardali K. Kowanetz M. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Smad pathway-specific transcriptional regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(WAF1/Cip1).J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 204: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), both of which are well-known target genes of BMP/R-Smads signaling. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of Id1 and p21 was effectively suppressed by overexpressed MTMR4 (Fig. 1, E and F) and enhanced by knockdown of endogenous MTMR4 (Fig. 1, G and H) after BMP2 stimulation. Taken together, these results suggested that MTMR4 could attenuate BMP signaling, possibly via directly interrogating R-Smad activation. To validate the aforementioned hypothesis, we set out to examine whether MTMR4 interacts with those R-Smads of BMP pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that YFP-MTMR4 transiently expressed in 293T cells readily associated with Flag-Smad1 (Fig. 2A) or HA-Smad5 (Fig. 2B), two of R-Smads in BMP signaling pathway. Such intermolecular interactions also occurred under physiological conditions since the endogenous MTMR4 and Smad1 associated with each other, and interestingly enough, only after BMP2 stimulation (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the amount of MTMR4 associated with Smad1 reduced proportionally to the phosphorylation levels of Smad1, suggesting that MTMR4 might preferentially interact with the activated Smad1 (Fig. 2C). To map the regions of contact between MTMR4 and Smad1, we further performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an array of truncational mutants of MTMR4 and Smad1 that transiently co-expressed in 293T cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B for the scheme of different mutants). The results showed that MTMR4 utilized its N-terminal region (MTMR4ΔFYVE, amino acids 1–591), which contains the conserved DUSP phosphatase domain, to contact Smad1 (Fig. 2D). Reciprocally, the MH2 domain, but not MH1 domain or linker region, of Smad1 was involved in contact with MTMR4 (Fig. 2E). These results suggested that the phosphorylated MH2 domain of Smad1 might serve as a physiological substrate of MTMR4. The aforementioned physical interaction between MTMR4 and the activated Smad1 suggested that BMP signaling could be modulated by MTMR4 via targeting Smad1 phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, HeLa cells were co-transfected with MTMR4 and Smad1, and the phosphorylation status of Smad1 was measured by a phosphor-SXS antibody specific to phosphorylated S463/S465 residues in the MH2 domain of Smad1, which are essential for Smad1 activation (6Shi Y. Massagué J. Mechanisms of TGF-β signaling from cell membrane to the nucleus.Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4800) Google Scholar). In the absence of MTMR4, Smad1 was phosphorylated rapidly, and it reached a peak around 30 min post-BMP2 treatment. Then the phosphorylation levels of Smad1 gradually decayed up to 4 h. Overexpression of MTMR4 did not alter the onset of Smad1 phosphorylation, however, it accelerated Smad1 dephosphorylation just after the peak time (30 min) of BMP2 treatment (Fig. 3A). This enhanced dephosphorylation of Smad1 was not due to its proteasomal degradation, because the levels of Smad1 protein remained the same in the presence or absence of overexpressed MTMR4 (Fig. 3A). Moreover, siRNA knockdown of the endogenous Mtmr4 gene in HeLa cells significantly attenuated Smad1 dephosphorylation when compared with the scrambled siRNA control (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the action of MTMR4 after phosphorylation of Smad1, overexpressed MTMR4 affected little BMP-target gene expression in the early time points and became more inhibitive in the later phase (supplemental Fig. S3). Therefore, these results suggested that MTMR4 control the velocity of Smad1 dephosphorylation, which could serve as a necessary mechanism to keep BMP activation signaling in homeostasis. To further detect the function of MTMR4 in dephosphorylation of Smad1, we then transiently expressed the “phosphatase dead” mutant (MTMR4-C407S) or the mutant defective in early endosome localization (MTMR4ΔFYVE) of MTMR4 (supplemental Fig. S2, A and C for the scheme of different mutants). Measurement of phosphorylation levels of Smad1 upon BMP2 stimulation indicated that neither the onset nor the decay of Smad1 phosphorylation was affected by MTMR4-C407S or MTMR4ΔFYVE (Fig. 3C). Indeed, both BRE and GCCG reporter assays showed that overexpressed MTMR4-C407S or MTMR4ΔFYVE (Fig. 3, D and E) could no longer suppress BMP activation as compared with wild type MTMR4 (Fig. 1, A and B). These results therefore suggested that Smad1 dephosphorylation would require an endosome-localized phosphatase activity of MTMR4. The regulatory specificity of BMP signaling can be conveniently scored by visual phenotypes of vein formation in Drosophila wings (13Blair S.S. Wing vein patterning in Drosophila and the analysis of intercellular signaling.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 293-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, to emphasize the biological significance of MTMR4 in the control of BMP signaling in vivo, we then assessed whether ectopically expressed MTMR4 might affect BMP signaling in the development of Drosophila wings. First we tissue-specifically knocked down BMP type I receptor tkv expression in wings by UAS-tkvRNAi driven by vg-gal4 (32Simmonds A.J. Brook W.J. Cohen S.M. Bell J.B. Distinguishable functions for engrailed and invected in anterior-posterior patterning in the Drosophila wing.Nature. 1995; 376: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Roughly 63% (n = 189) of vg-gal4/+;UAS-tkvRNAi(III)/+ wings (Fig. 4B) showed branches at posterior crossvein (PCV) compared with normal wings of vg-gal4/+ (Fig. 4A) or UAS-tkvRNAi(III)/+ (supplemental Fig. S4A) controls (Fig. 4J for statistical analysis). The same branching phenotype was obtained in another independent strain, UAS-tkvRNAi(II)/vg-gal4 (81% (n = 200), supplemental Fig. S4B, F for representative phenotype). These results would represent the first line of evidence that tkv was required for vein development in wings. We then generated three lines of transgenic flies, UAS-MTMR4, UAS-MTMR4-C407S, and UAS-CG3632, respectively. CG3632 is a Drosophila homologue of MTMR4 that shares all the conserved functional domains including the phosphatase domain (supplemental Fig. S2C) typified for the catalytic subgroup of MTM super family (23Laporte J. Bedez F. Bolino A. Mandel J.L. Myotubularins, a large disease-associated family of cooperating catalytically active and inactive phosphoinositides phosphatases.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R285-R292Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Interestingly, wings containing overexpressed mtmr4 (UAS-MTMR4/vg-gal4) or cg3632 (UAS-CG3632/vg-gal4) also developed the similar branched PCV as to those in tkv knockdown lines, albeit at slightly lower rates (20.6% (n = 126) for UAS-CG3632/vg-gal4 and 24.2% (n = 120) for UAS-MTMR4/vg-gal4, respectively) (Fig. 4, C, D, and J). In contrast, the wings developed normally in the UAS-MTMR4-C407S/vg-gal4 line (Fig. 4E, J, n = 150). The phenotypic similarity in PCV development would suggest that MTMR4 might play a role in tkv signaling, and more importantly, by tempering Dpp activation signaling when MTMR4 was overexpressed. To substantiate this notion, we went on to assess whether overexpression of MTMR4 or CG3632 could synergize wing patterning deficiency in the background of the reduced tkv expression. As expected, vg-gal4-driven simultaneous expression of CG3632 and tkvRNAi(III) in wings (UAS-CG3632/vg-gal4; UAS-tkvRNAi(III)/+) caused 51.8% branched veins in PCV (n = 110, supplemental Fig. S5A). More profoundly, 14% showed intense deformity (classified as “enhanced” phenotype) with partial duplications and gaps (Fig. 4, F, J, and supplemental Fig. S5B). Similarly, UAS-MTMR4/vg-gal4; UAS-tkvRNAi (III)/+ wings not only had the branched PCV (55.2%, n = 105, supplemental Fig. S5C) and enhanced phenotype (18.1%, n = 105, Fig. 4, G and J and supplemental Fig. S5D), but also displayed more severe deformation (4.8%, n = 105) with longer branch"
https://openalex.org/W1997894407,"In 1999, Ontario implemented a policy to offer HIV counseling and testing to all pregnant women and undertook measures to increase HIV testing. We evaluated the effectiveness of the new policy by examining HIV test uptake, the number of HIV-infected women identified and, in 2002, the HIV rate in women not tested during prenatal care. We analyzed test uptake among women receiving prenatal care from 1999 to 2010. We examined HIV test uptake and HIV rate by year, age and health region. In an anonymous, unlinked study, we determined the HIV rate in pregnant women not tested. Prenatal HIV test uptake in Ontario increased dramatically, from 33% in the first quarter of 1999 to 96% in 2010. Test uptake was highest in younger women but increased in all age groups. All health regions improved and experienced similar test uptake in recent years. The HIV rate among pregnant women tested in 2010 was 0.13/1,000; in Toronto, the rate was 0.28 per 1,000. In the 2002 unlinked study, the HIV rate was 0.62/1,000 among women not tested in pregnancy compared to 0.31/1,000 among tested women. HIV incidence among women who tested more than once was 0.05/1,000 person-years. In response to the new policy in Ontario, prenatal HIV testing uptake improved dramatically among women in all age groups and health regions. A reminder to physicians who had not ordered a prenatal HIV test appeared to be very effective. In 2002, the HIV rate in women who were not tested was twice that of tested women: though 77% of pregnant women had been tested, only 63% of HIV-infected women were tested. HIV testing uptake was estimated at 98% in 2010."

A total of 52 diploid sequence types (DSTs) were generated by the MLST, all of which were new to the central database. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) dendrograms were constructed, which showed that the 58 isolates were distributed robustly and 6 main groups were clustered regardless of the specimen source and medical department. The minimum spanning tree (MST) of the 58 isolates (52 DSTs) and all 401 isolates (268 DSTs) in the C. tropicalis central database (http://pubmlst.org/ctropicalis/) indicated that the isolates in this study clustered in three relative pure clonal complexes, and 2 clustered with isolates from Taiwan, Belgium, Brazil, and the US. This study presents the first MLST analysis of C. tropicalis isolates from Mainland China, which may be useful for further studies on the similarity, genetic relationship, and molecular epidemiology of C. tropicalis strains worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W1965446609,"TG-interacting factor (TGIF) in Drosophila consists of two tandemly-repeated genes, achintya (Dmachi) and vismay (Dmvis), which act as transcriptional activators in Drosophila spermatogenesis. In contrast, TGIF in humans is a transcriptional repressor that binds directly to DNA or interacts with corepressors to repress the transcription of target genes. In this study, we investigated the characteristics and functions of BmTGIF, a Bombyx mori homolog of DmTGIF. Like DmTGIF, BmTGIF is predominantly expressed in the testes and ovaries. Four alternatively spliced isoforms could be isolated from testes, and two isoforms from ovaries. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated BmTGIF was abundantly expressed in the testis of 3rd instar larvae, when the testis is almost full of primary spermatocytes. The results of luciferase assays indicated that BmTGIF contains two adjacent acidic domains that activate the transcription of reporter genes. Immunofluorescence assay in BmN cells showed that the BmTGIF protein was located mainly in the nucleus, and paraffin sections of testis showed BmTGIF was grossly expressed in primary spermatocytes and mature sperms. Consistent with the role of DmVis in Drosophila development, BmTGIF significantly affected spermatid differentiation, as indicated by hematoxylin-eosin staining of paraffin sections of testis from BmTGIF-small interfering RNA (siRNA)-injected male silkworms. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that BmTGIF interacted with BmAly, and that they may recruit other factors to form a complex to regulate the genes required for meiotic divisions and spermatid differentiation. The results of this analysis of BmTGIF will improve our understanding of the mechanism of spermatid differentiation in B. mori, with potential applications for pest control."
https://openalex.org/W2073269352,"Data indicated that dyslexic individuals exhibited difficulties on tasks involving Working Memory (WM). Previous studies have suggested that these deficits stem from impaired processing in the Phonological Loop (PL). The PL impairment was connected to poor phonological processing. However, recent data has pointed to the Central Executive (CE) system as another source of WM deficit in dyslexic readers. This opened a debate whether the WM deficit stems solely from PL or can also be seen as an outcome of poor CE processing. In an attempt to verify this question, the current study compared adult skilled and compensated dyslexic readers with no impairment of phonological skills. The participants' PL and CE processing were tested by using the fNIR device attached to the frontal lobe and measured the changes in brain oxygen values when performing N-back task. As it was previously suggested, the N = 0 represented PL and N = 1 to 3 represent CE processing. It was hypothesized that dyslexic readers who show non-impaired phonological skills will exhibit deficits mainly in the CE subsystem and to a lesser extent in the PL. Results indicated that the two reading level groups did not differ in their accuracy and reaction times in any of the N-Back conditions. However, the dyslexic readers demonstrated significant lower maximum oxyHb values in the upper left frontal lobe, mainly caused due to a significant lower activity under the N = 1 condition. Significant task effects were found in the medial left hemisphere, and the high medial right hemisphere. In addition, significant correlations between fNIR-features, reading performance and speed of processing were found. The higher oxyHb values, the better reading and speed of processing performance obtained. The results of the current study support the hypothesis that at least for the group of dyslexics with non-impaired PL, WM deficit stems from poor CE activity."

https://openalex.org/W2022791310,"The incidence of heart failure in type 2 diabetes is high and it has poorer prognosis when compared with patients without diabetes. Access to echocardiography is limited and alternative methods to identify early heart failure such as the measurement of natriuretic peptides levels have been proposed. However, their wide biological variation could limit their clinical utility. Our aim was to determine if the intrinsic biological variation of one of these peptides, N-terminal proBNP, is as wide in type 2 diabetes as it is in health and to calculate the critical difference values that could be utilised in clinical practice to ensure changes observed between two samples are due to intervention rather than to its biological variability.12 postmenopausal women with diet controlled type 2 diabetes and without heart failure were compared with 11 control postmenopausal women without diabetes. N-terminal proBNP levels were measured on 10 occasions. The biological variation was calculated according to Fraser's methods. The mean NT-proBNP level was similar in both groups (mean ± standard deviation; type 2 diabetes, 10.7 pmol/L± 8.5 versus 8.49±6.0 pmol/L, p = 0.42). The biological variation was also similarly wide. The critical difference in patients with type 2 diabetes was between -70% and ±236%.Type 2 diabetes does not appear to significantly influence the marked biological variation of N-terminal proBNP in postmenopausal women. The critical difference values reported in this study could be used to titrate therapy or monitor response to interventions although the change required in between samples is wide and this might limit its utility."
