https://openalex.org/W3042091277,"In January 2020, a novel betacoronavirus (family Coronaviridae), named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the etiological agent of a cluster of pneumonia cases occurring in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China1,2. The disease arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), subsequently spread rapidly causing a worldwide pandemic. Here we examine the added value of near real-time genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in a subpopulation of infected patients during the first 10 weeks of COVID-19 containment in Australia and compare findings from genomic surveillance with predictions of a computational agent-based model (ABM). Using the Australian census data, the ABM generates over 24 million software agents representing the population of Australia, each with demographic attributes of an anonymous individual. It then simulates transmission of the disease over time, spreading from specific infection sources, using contact rates of individuals within different social contexts. We report that the prospective sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 clarified the probable source of infection in cases where epidemiological links could not be determined, significantly decreased the proportion of COVID-19 cases with contentious links, documented genomically similar cases associated with concurrent transmission in several institutions and identified previously unsuspected links. Only a quarter of sequenced cases appeared to be locally acquired and were concordant with predictions from the ABM. These high-resolution genomic data are crucial to track cases with locally acquired COVID-19 and for timely recognition of independent importations once border restrictions are lifted and trade and travel resume. The combination of nearly real-time genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients during the first 10 weeks of COVID-19 containment in Australia and epidemiological modeling is helping in understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially guiding public health decisions."

In response, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency on 7th April in seven prefectures. The study conducted an immediate survey on 8th April to record the response of the general public to the first emergency status due to epidemics. The study hypothesized that personality traits, moral foundation, and political ideology can influence people’s mentality, cognition, and behavior toward COVID-19. Based on a nationwide dataset of 1856 respondents (male = 56.3%, Mage = 46.7, emergency regions = 49.9%), the study found that personality, morality, and ideology altered mental health status and motivated behaviors toward COVID-19. Neuroticism and avoiding harm involved cognition and behavior through various means. The study also found significant differences among demographic groups. Results are informative and contributive to the governance and management of, and aid for, individual responses to the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3042042036,"Mutations of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex occur in 20% of all human cancers, including ovarian cancer. Approximately half of ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCC) carry mutations in the SWI/SNF subunit ARID1A, while small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) presents with inactivating mutations of the SWI/SNF ATPase SMARCA4 alongside epigenetic silencing of the ATPase SMARCA2. Loss of these ATPases disrupts SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling activity and may also interfere with the function of other histone-modifying enzymes that associate with or are dependent on SWI/SNF activity. One such enzyme is lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A), which regulates the chromatin landscape and gene expression by demethylating proteins such as histone H3. Cross-cancer analysis of the TCGA database shows that LSD1 is highly expressed in SWI/SNF-mutated tumors. SCCOHT and OCCC cell lines have shown sensitivity to the reversible LSD1 inhibitor SP-2577 (Seclidemstat), suggesting that SWI/SNF-deficient ovarian cancers are dependent on LSD1 activity. Moreover, it has been shown that inhibition of LSD1 stimulates interferon (IFN)-dependent anti-tumor immunity through induction of endogenous retroviral elements and may thereby overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade. In this study, we investigated the ability of SP-2577 to promote anti-tumor immunity and T-cell infiltration in SCCOHT and OCCC cell lines. We found that SP-2577 stimulated IFN-dependent anti-tumor immunity in SCCOHT and promoted the expression of PD-L1 in both SCCOHT and OCCC. Together, these findings suggest that the combination therapy of SP-2577 with checkpoint inhibitors may induce or augment immunogenic responses of SWI/SNF-mutated ovarian cancers and warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3041749610,"The main aim of the present study was to develop, validate and test an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that contributes to the overall understanding of students' intention to use digital tools in a blended learning context of higher education. The external bidimensional factor of familiarity with digital tools, which is not usually explained by the TAM, was included, and evaluated. Following a four-stage scale development technique, a seven-dimensional 25-item survey was developed, which includes two external correlated variables: familiarity with high-tech digital tools and familiarity with traditional digital tools, two mediator variables-computer anxiety, and perceived barriers, and three response variables, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and intention to use. The initial version of the survey was administered on 250 undergraduate students. Next, for another sample of 206 students, latent dimensions of the survey were tested using exploratory factor analysis. The structure of the survey was validated in two other subsequent stages with one sample of 262 responses of undergraduates and one of 310 responses of master's students from two different universities. All students who agreed to participate in research attended blended learning. The validity, reliability and invariance of the instrument were established by psychometric analyses. Collected data indicated that the survey has an adequate multifactorial structure that is reliable and invariant across degree levels. The scale is recommended for use in higher education studies targeting the promotion of blended learning and reduction of negative attitudes of learners toward digital instruments, supporting university professors to select their own efficient way to teach."
https://openalex.org/W3041903257,"Apple cultivation is one of the most important sources of livelihood in Indian side of the Himalayas. The present study focuses on the apple orchards of Himachal Pradesh, a state within the Himalayan Mountains, a major apple producers of India. In the study, it is found that the optimum apple growing conditions in the region have been consistently shifting and farmers are shifting their orchards to the higher altitudes. For example, orchards have shifted to 1500-2500 meters in the 2000s compared to the cultivated elevation of 1200-1500 meters during 1980s. As of 2014, apples are being cultivated at an elevation of more than 3500 meters, for example, the newly developed orchards of Leo village in upper Kinnaur and Keylong area of Lahul and Spiti districts. Chilling hours for different districts are calculated. The trend of temperature during the growth period, winter session and annual rainfall have been analysed using Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope test. Data catalogued from different time periods indicates that the northward shift (towards higher altitude) is due to changes in chilling hours, total annual rainfall and mean surface temperature during the apple growing season. The mean surface temperature in all the districts has increased by almost 0.5°C during last 2000-2014. These changes are directly related to global warming. While the changing climate is reducing the apple production in low altitudinal regions of the state, it is creating new opportunities for apple cultivation in higher altitudes as conditions are getting more favourable for apple growth in those higher regions. The associated socio-economic changes are posing new societal issues for the local farmers."
https://openalex.org/W3041625478,"The purpose of the article is to analyze the interaction effect between social network and extension service in farmers’ agricultural technology adoption efficiency (TAE). The empirical analysis refers to samples of farmers’ water-saving irrigation technology (WSIT) adoption from Minqin, China. The result indicates that social network and extension service can improve farmers’ TAE, but they are found to be competitive from the perspective of overall social network. While from the perspective of four dimensions of social network, interaction and trust have positive effects on farmers’ TAE, and learning and trust are found to be competitive with extension service. The policy implication describes as follows. First, government should pay attention to farmers’ social learning and demonstration effect. And series of measures should be taken to cultivate farmers’ social network. Second, extension service should be improved to satisfy farmers’ multiple demand on agricultural technology. Third, government should combine the effects of social network and extension service, and make different promotion strategies for different regions. In addition, other influential factors cannot be ignored."
https://openalex.org/W3041766377,"Background and objectives Globally, studies have shown associations between maternal stimulation and early child development. Yet, little is known about the prevalence of paternal and other caregivers’ stimulation practices, particularly in low- and- middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods Data from the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS) and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) were combined across 62 LMICs (2010–2018). The sample included 205,150 mothers of children aged 3 and 4 years. High levels of stimulation were defined as caregiver engagement in at least 4 out of 6 possible activities with the child. The proportion of mothers, fathers, and other caregivers providing high levels of stimulation was calculated by country, region, and for the whole sample. Socioeconomic disparities within and between countries were estimated. Results On average, 39.8% (95% CI 37.4 to 42.2) of mothers, 11.9% (95% CI 10.1 to 13.8) of fathers, and 20.7% (95% CI 18.4 to 23.0) of other adult caregivers provided high levels of stimulation. Stimulation varied by region, country income group, and Human Development Index (HDI), with higher levels of maternal and paternal–but not other caregivers’–stimulation in high-income and high-HDI countries. Within countries, stimulation levels were, on average, lower in the poorest relative to the richest households, and some but not all countries exhibited differences by child sex (i.e., boys vs. girls) or area (i.e., urban vs. rural). Conclusions Results suggest a need for intervention efforts that focus on increasing caregiver stimulation in LMICs, particularly for fathers and in low-income contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3042190919,"Burnout causes personal suffering and adverse professional consequences. It is prevalent among medical students, although the relationship between burnout and lifestyle factors are understudied in Chinese medical students. Thus, this study aims to (i) estimate the prevalence of burnout among medical students in Hong Kong (HK) and (ii) delineate the relationship between burnout and various lifestyle factors.1,341 students were invited to complete a questionnaire from September to December 2017. Burnout was measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Lifestyle factors including drinking habit, sleep habit and quality, and exercise level were assessed by validated instruments, including Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT-C), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity (GSLTPA), respectively. Smoking status and use of self-medications were also inquired into, while demographic data was self-reported. Prevalence of burnout with confidence intervals was calculated. Difference in lifestyle and demographic data in students with or without burnout, were compared by t-test and Chi-square/Fisher's exact test. From this, all associations with significant p-value at p<0.1 were entered into the multiple logistic regression model.731 students (55.6%) responded to the questionnaire. Prevalence of burnout was 27.9% (95%CI: 24.6%-31.5%). Only 3 students in the whole sample smoked; and 6.6% of students drank weekly but rarely drank more than 2 drinks per week. 6.3% and 2.3% self-medicated themselves with medications to improve their sleep and concentration, respectively. Using a multiple logistic regression model, only sleep quality and exercise level were significantly associated with the presence of burnout.Around a quarter of medical students in HK suffered from burnout. Burnout was found to be significantly associated with sleep quality and physical exercise. The study also highlighted that HK medical students lived very different lifestyles from those from other countries. More research is needed to design and establish the effectiveness of lifestyle interventional programs that enhance exercise level and sleep quality."
https://openalex.org/W3040777364,"Abstract High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is a fatal gynecologic malignancy in the U.S. with limited treatment options. New therapeutic strategies include targeting of the cell cycle checkpoints, e.g., ATR and CHK1. We recently reported a promising clinical activity of the CHK1 inhibitor (CHK1i) prexasertib monotherapy in BRCA wild-type (BRCAwt) HGSOC patients. In this study, biopsies of treated patients and cell line models were used to investigate possible mechanisms of resistance to CHK1i. We report that BRCAwt HGSOC develops resistance to prexasertib monotherapy via a prolonged G2 delay induced by lower CDK1/CyclinB1 activity, thus preventing cells from mitotic catastrophe and cell death. On the other hand, we noted CHK1’s regulation on RAD51-mediated homologous recombination (HR) repair was not altered in CHK1i-resistant cells. Therefore, CHK1i sensitizes CHK1i-resistant cells to DNA damaging agents such as gemcitabine or hydroxyurea by inhibition of HR. In summary, our results demonstrate new mechanistic insights of functionally distinct CHK1 activities and highlight a potential combination treatment approach to overcome CHK1i resistance in BRCAwt HGSOC."
https://openalex.org/W3042203520,"Rice cultivar ""Weiyou916"" (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Indica) were cultured with control (10 mM NO3-) and nitrate deficient solution (0 mM NO3-) for four weeks. Nitrogen (N) deficiency significantly decreased the content of N and P, dry weight (DW) of the shoots and roots, but increased the ratio of root to shoot in O. sativa. N deficiency decreased the photosynthesis rate and the maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry (Fv/Fm), however, increased the intercellular CO2 concentration and primary fluorescence (Fo). N deficiency significantly increased the production of H2O2 and membrane lipid peroxidation revealed as increased MDA content in O. sativa leaves. N deficiency significantly increased the contents of starch, sucrose, fructose, and malate, but did not change that of glucose and total soluble protein in O. sativa leaves. The accumulated carbohydrates and H2O2 might further accelerate biosynthesis of lignin in O. sativa leaves under N limitation. A total of 1635 genes showed differential expression in response to N deficiency revealed by Illumina sequencing. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that 195 DEGs were found to highly enrich in nine GO terms. Most of DEGs involved in photosynthesis, biosynthesis of ethylene and gibberellins were downregulated, whereas most of DEGs involved in cellular transport, lignin biosynthesis and flavonoid metabolism were upregulated by N deficiency in O. sativa leaves. Results of real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) further verified the RNA-Seq data. For the first time, DEGs involved oxygen-evolving complex, phosphorus response and lignin biosynthesis were identified in rice leaves. Our RNA-Seq data provided a global view of transcriptomic profile of principal processes implicated in the adaptation of N deficiency in O. sativa and shed light on the candidate direction in rice breeding for green and sustainable agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W3042114534,"Introduction Given the social, economic, and health consequences of early parenthood, unintended pregnancy, and the risks of HIV infection and subsequent transmission, there is an urgent need to understand how adolescents make sexual and reproductive decisions regarding contraceptive use. This study sought to assess the association between female adolescents’ reproductive health decision-making capacity and their contraceptive usage. Materials and methods Data was obtained from pooled current Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 32 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The unit of analysis for this study was adolescents in sexual unions [n = 15,858]. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted using Pearson chi-square tests and binary logistic regression respectively. All analyses were performed using STATA version 14.2. Results were presented using Odds Ratios [OR] and adjusted Odds Ratios [AOR]. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results The results showed that 68.66% of adolescents in SSA had the capacity to make reproductive health decisions. The overall prevalence of contraceptive use was 18.87%, ranging from 1.84% in Chad to 45.75% in Zimbabwe. Adolescents who had the capacity to take reproductive health decisions had higher odds of using contraceptives [AOR = 1.47; CI = 1.31–1.65, p < 0.001]. The odds of contraceptive use among female adolescents increased with age, with those aged 19 years having the highest likelihood of using contraceptives [AOR = 3.12; CI = 2.27–34.29, p < 0.001]. Further, the higher the level of education, the more likely female adolescents will use contraceptives, and this was more predominant among those with secondary/higher education [AOR = 2.50; CI = 2.11–2.96, p < 0.001]. Female adolescents who were cohabiting had higher odds of using contraceptives, compared to those who were married [AOR = 1.69; CI = 1.47–1.95, p < 0.001]. The odds of contraceptive use was highest among female adolescents from the richest wealth quintile, compared to those from the poorest wealth quintile [AOR = 1.65; CI = 1.35–2.01, p<0.001]. Conversely, female adolescents in rural areas were less likely to use contraceptives, compared to those in urban areas [AOR = 0.78; CI = 0.69–0.89, p < 0.001]. Conclusion The use of general and modern contraceptives among adolescents in SSA remains low. Therefore, there is a need to strengthen existing efforts on contraceptives usage among adolescents in SSA. This goal can be achieved by empowering these young females, particularly those in the rural areas where the level of literacy is very low to take positive reproductive health decisions to prevent unintended teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDs and other sexually transmitted infections. This approach would help reduce maternal mortality and early childbirth in studied SSA countries."

We investigated if the tear volume in DE patients affects the results of MMP-9 immunoassay in clinical and in vitro settings. This cross-sectional study enrolled 188 eyes of 188 DE patients. The clinical symptoms and signs of DE were assessed using the Ocular Surface Disease Index and visual analog scale, strip meniscometry, tear break-up time, and tear meniscus height (TMH), area (TMA), and depth (TMD) using swept-source optical coherence tomography and corneal and conjunctival staining scores. For quantitative evaluation, the bands produced by the InflammaDry test were analyzed with ImageJ. DE subjects were grouped according to MMP-9 positivity and TMH. The InflammaDry-positive group showed greater TMH, TMA, and TMD than the MMP-9-negative group (p < 0.05). InflammaDry test band density in the high TMH group was significantly greater than that in the low and normal TMH groups (p < 0.05). InflammaDry test band density correlated positively with TMH, TMA, and TMD (all p < 0.05). InflammaDry test results were influenced by tear volume. Low tear volume in aqueous tear-deficient DE may induce false-negative results, and reflex tearing during the test may induce false-positive results."
https://openalex.org/W3041723269,"In contrast to most rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors, the glycoprotein hormone receptors (GPHR) have a large extracellular N-terminus for hormone binding. The hormones do not directly activate the transmembrane domain but mediate their action via a, thus, far only partially known Tethered Agonistic LIgand (TALI). The existence of such an intramolecular agonist was initially indicated by site-directed mutation studies and activating peptides derived from the extracellular hinge region. It is still unknown precisely how TALI is involved in intramolecular signal transmission. We combined systematic mutagenesis studies at the luteinizing hormone receptor and the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), stimulation with a drug-like agonist (E2) of the TSHR, and structural homology modeling to unravel the functional and structural properties defining the TALI region. Here, we report that TALI (a) is predisposed to constitutively activate GPHR, (b) can by itself rearrange GPHR into a fully active conformation, (c) stabilizes active GPHR conformation, and (d) is not involved in activation of the TSHR by E2. In the active state conformation, TALI forms specific interactions between the N-terminus and the transmembrane domain. We show that stabilization of an active state is dependent on TALI, including activation by hormones and constitutively activating mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3041532002,"Gouty arthritis is the one of the most painful arthritis and is caused by an inflammatory reaction. This study investigated whether astaxanthin (AXT), which has documented anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, exhibits protective effects against monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced inflammation. Cell viability of J774A.1 murine macrophages was assessed by AXT dose-dependent incubation by MTT assays, and expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 proteins as well as secretion of IL-1β were also analyzed under MSU crystals stimulation with or without AXT treatment. The production of inflammatory mediators was found to significantly decrease with AXT treatment, and the formation of the inflammasome complex was also attenuated when cells were co-stimulated with MSU crystals and AXT. Furthermore, we found that expression of the MAPK pathway was downregulated in J774A.1 cells. AXT also inhibited the induction of COX-2 and IL-6 in human chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts by western blots. Finally, an MSU crystal intra-articular injection rat model for gouty arthritis was utilized in which treatment groups received 5-daily intraperitoneal injections of AXT prior to MSU crystal stimulation, or once intra-articular injections of AXT following MSU crystal stimulation for 6 hours. Results of synovitis score analysis revealed that inflammation was significantly attenuated in the group which received intraperitoneal AXT injection prior to MSU crystal stimulation compared to the group which received MSU only. These results indicate that AXT attenuates the effects of MSU crystal-induced inflammation by suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Our findings that the anti-inflammatory activities of AXT may be beneficial in the treatment of MSU crystal-induced arthritis."

Since previous studies explored the association between tooth loss and handgrip strength showed incongruous results, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between tooth loss and handgrip strength in Tianjin, China. Cross-sectional data in the present study used baseline data of Tianjin Chronic Low-grade Systemic Inflammation and Health (TCLSIH) Cohort Study during 2013-2016. Eligible adults (n = 26275) were classified into four groups depending on the number of missing teeth (excluding third molars): 0, 1-2, 3-5 and ≥6. Handgrip strength was measured using a handheld type dynamometer. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the relationships between tooth loss and handgrip strength and handgrip strength per body weight according to gender. After adjustment for potential confounders, the relationships existed between increasing categories of tooth loss and handgrip strength, as well as handgrip strength per weight. The data of stratified analysis showed that there was a trending association between decreased handgrip strength and fewer retained teeth both in males and females less than 60 years of age (P for trend <0.01); whereas no significant association 60 years of age or older. Moreover, loss of more than 3 teeth was significantly associated with reduced muscle strength (P <0.01). Tooth loss is independently associated with handgrip strength in Chinese adults less than 60 years of age."
https://openalex.org/W3041715102,"Perennial vegetables are a neglected and underutilized class of crops with potential to address 21st century challenges. They represent 33-56% of cultivated vegetable species, and occupy 6% of world vegetable cropland. Despite their distinct relevance to climate change mitigation and nutritional security, perennial vegetables receive little attention in the scientific literature. Compared to widely grown and marketed vegetable crops, many perennial vegetables show higher levels of key nutrients needed to address deficiencies. Trees with edible leaves are the group of vegetables with the highest levels of these key nutrients. Individual ""multi-nutrient"" species are identified with very high levels of multiple nutrients for addressing deficiencies. This paper reports on the synthesis and meta-analysis of a heretofore fragmented global literature on 613 cultivated perennial vegetables, representing 107 botanical families from every inhabited continent, in order to characterize the extent and potential of this class of crops. Carbon sequestration potential from new adoption of perennial vegetables is estimated at 22.7-280.6 MMT CO2-eq/yr on 4.6-26.4 Mha by 2050."
https://openalex.org/W3041876489,"The potential risk of internet use on adolescents’ self-harm is a major concern. Vulnerable adolescents who are susceptible to bullying are also susceptible to the negative influence of the internet. In this study, the pathway associations were investigated between the risk factors of deliberate self-harm, experience of being bullied, internet use, and protective factors of maternal monitoring on perceived happiness of 12- and 13-year-old adolescents in the Taiwan Birth Cohort Pilot Study dataset (n = 1,457). The Chinese Oxford Happiness Questionnaire was used to measure the adolescents’ self-perceived levels of happiness, in two dimensions of social adaptation status and psychological well-being. Our results show that 354 (24.3%) of the 12-year-olds reported having been bullied, and 289 (19.8%) of the 13-year-olds reported this. Seventy-nine (5.4%) of 13-year-olds reported deliberate self-harm in the past year. Results of a structural equation model showed that those who had been bullied at age 12 years were at greater risk of deliberate self-harm at age 13 years. A negative association was found between duration of internet use and perceived level of happiness. Adolescents who spent >5 h online during days off school were at higher risk of deliberate self-harm, and perceived a lower level of happiness. Therefore, spending >5 h online during days off school could be used as an indicator in future preventive action programs to screen out those at a high risk of excessive internet use, deliberate self-harm, and psychological well-being and social adjustment issues."

On Day 3 of the estrous cycle, either E.coli suspension (E.coli group) or saline (SAL group) were administered into uterine horns. In the control gilts (CON group), only laparotomy was carried out. Eight days later, E.coli treatment evoked severe acute endometritis, significantly reduced Y1Rs mRNA and protein expression and increased Y2Rs protein expression in myometrium in relation to the CON and SAL groups. Compared to period before NPY application, NPY (10−7 M) significantly reduced amplitude in myometrium and endometrium/myometrium and frequency in myometrium of the CON and SAL groups and amplitude in endometrium/myometrium and frequency in strips of the E.coli group. In this group, after using NPY (10−7 M), the amplitude rose significantly in both kinds of strips, while frequency fell in endometrium/myometrium in relation to the SAL group. In the CON and SAL groups, NPY (10−7 M) with Y1Rs antagonist significantly increased the amplitude in endometrium/myometrium, while with Y2Rs antagonist caused a rise in myometrium. In the E.coli group after using Y1Rs or Y2Rs antagonist and NPY (10−7 M) amplitude did not significantly change in endometrium/myometrium, and this parameter was significantly lower after using the NPY and Y1Rs antagonist than in other groups. Y1Rs antagonist and NPY (10−8, 10−7 M) significantly increased frequency in endometrium/myometrium of the CON and SAL groups. In the E.coli group, Y1Rs or Y2Rs antagonists and NPY (10−7 M) significantly increased frequency in myometrium and it was significantly higher than in the CON group. Inflammation changes Y1Rs and Y2Rs expression in myometrium of the inflamed pig uterus and NPY reduces this organ contractility by Y1Rs and Y2Rs."
https://openalex.org/W3040742359,"NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multiprotein complex which forms within cells in response to various microbial and self-derived triggers. Mutations in the gene encoding NLRP3 cause rare cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and growing evidence links NLRP3 inflammasome to common diseases such as Alzheimer´s disease. In order to modulate different stages of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly nine peptides whose sequences correspond to segments of inflammasome components NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) were selected. Five peptides inhibited IL-1β release, caspase-1 activation and ASC oligomerization in response to soluble and particulate NLRP3 triggers. Modulatory peptides also attenuated IL-1β maturation induced by constitutive CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants. Peptide corresponding to H2-H3 segment of ASC pyrin domain selectively inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to NLRP3 pyrin domain in the micromolar range. The peptide had no effect on AIM2 and NLRC4 inflammasomes as well as NF-κB pathway. The peptide effectively dampened neutrophil infiltration in the silica-induced peritonitis and when equipped with Antennapedia or Angiopep-2 motifs crossed the blood-brain barrier in a mouse model. Our study demonstrates that peptides represent an important tool for targeting multiprotein inflammatory complexes and can serve as the basis for the development of novel anti-inflammatory strategies for neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3040854731,"Recent discoveries of at least two heart fields and dynamic nature of cardiac development as well as controversies regarding the participation of heart fields in development of different heart structures led us to investigate the dynamics of incorporation of the first and second heart fields and prospective fate of the straight heart tube by labeling chicken embryos in vivo with the fluorescent lipophilic dye DiI. The cephalic and caudal limits of the anterior and posterior segments of the straight heart tube were labeled in two groups of embryos. Labels were tracked along the ""C,"" ""S,"" and ""U"" loops up to the tetracavitary or mature heart (n = 30 embryos/group; torsion and looping stage). To determine whether the atria and atrioventricular canal are derived from the first heart field the straight heart tube was cultured in vitro and immunodetection of Sox-9 and troponin I was performed to identify the mesenchymal and myocardial lineages respectively. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunodetection was used to determine the involvement of cell proliferation in heart tube development during torsion and looping. Embryological constitution of the straight heart tube and heart looping (C, S, and U) were not consistent with current descriptions. In fact, right ventricle precursors were absent in the straight heart tube derived from the first heart field. During torsion and looping, the cephalic segment of the straight heart tube gradually shifted into the heart tube until it was located at the myocardial interventricular septum in the tetracavitary heart. In contrast, the caudal segment of the straight heart tube was elongated and remodeled to become the first heart field derived left ventricle and the proximal part of the ventricular inlets. The ventricular outflows, right ventricle, distal part of the ventricular inlets, and atria developed from the second heart field."

Substantive innovation and strategic innovation in one region could affect innovation in another region. In addition, the direct effect and spatial spillover effect of innovation policy could significantly affect innovation; however, they exert a higher impact on substantive innovation. Considering different policy tools, we found that government subsidies exert a significant positive impact on substantive innovation and strategic innovation, whereas financial institution loans exert a significant negative impact on substantive innovation and strategic innovation. And for the impact range, the government subsidies are higher than that of financial institution loans. Furthermore, this study reveals the leading environmental factors affecting regional innovation and provide a policy basis to promote the construction of an innovation-oriented country."

Objective The aim of this study was to identify the frequency of antibiotic prescription for treating dental infections in children among dentists in teaching institutions of Karachi, Pakistan and whether they are adhering to the prescribed international guidelines. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in three private and two public colleges of Karachi. After taking written informed consent and checking the inclusion criteria, a total of 380 participants were interviewed using a pre-designed validated questionnaire which included demographic profile and clinical case scenarios. Data were entered and analyzed on SPSS version 20. Inferential analysis was performed using chi-square test. The significance level was set at 0.05. Results Of the 380 subjects, a majority (71.3%) treated 15 or less children per month (n = 271) while 28.7% of dentists (n = 109) treated more than 15 children per month. Overall adherence to American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry guidelines was low from 26.1% to 44.2%. The difference between adherence of dentists with low and high volume of pediatric patients was significantly different for case scenarios 1, 3, 4 and 5 (p<0.001 for all) where dentists who treated 15 or less children per month were more likely to be adherent to standard antibiotic prescription guidelines than those who treated more than 15 children per month. Conclusions This study shows that majority of dentists, particularly dentists with high volume of pediatric patients lacked adherence to professional guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for treating dental infection in children. There seem to be a lack of harmony between the recommended professional guidelines and the antibiotic prescribing pattern of dentists. Regular updates and continuing medical education for the health professionals regarding comprehensible and specific professional guidelines may lead to improved adherence of antibiotics prescription amongst dentists."
https://openalex.org/W3041778989,"Anxiety disorders (AD) are the most common mental conditions affecting an estimated 40 million adults in the United States. Amiloride, a diuretic agent, has shown efficacy in reducing anxious responses in preclinical models by inhibiting the acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC). By delivering amiloride via nasal route, rapid onset of action can be achieved due to direct ""nose-to-brain"" access. Therefore, this study reports the formulation, physical, chemical, and microbiological stability of an extemporaneously prepared amiloride 2 mg/mL nasal spray. The amiloride nasal spray was prepared by adding 100 mg of amiloride hydrochloride to 50 mL of sterile water for injection in a sterile reagent bottle. A stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed and validated. Forced-degradation studies were performed to confirm the ability of the HPLC method to identify the degradation products from amiloride distinctively. The physical stability of the amiloride nasal spray was assessed by pH, clarity, and viscosity assessments. For chemical stability studies, samples of nasal sprays stored at room temperature were collected at time-points 0, 3 hr., 24 hr., and 7 days and were assayed in triplicate using the stability-indicating HPLC method. Microbiological stability of the nasal spray solution was evaluated for up to 7 days based on the sterility test outlined in United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) chapter 71. The stability-indicating HPLC method identified the degradation products of amiloride without interference from amiloride. All tested solutions retained over 90% of the initial amiloride concentration for the 7-day study period. There were no changes in color, pH, and viscosity in any sample. The nasal spray solutions were sterile for up to 7 days in all samples tested. An extemporaneously prepared nasal spray solution of amiloride hydrochloride (2 mg/mL) was physically, chemically, and microbiologically stable for 7 days when stored at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W3041201008,"Purpose Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is characterized by a 2-layered myocardium composed of a noncompacted (NC) and a compacted (C) layer. The echocardiographic NC:C ratio is difficult to assess in many patients. The aim of the study was to assess the value of cardiac computed tomography (CCT) for the diagnosis of LVNC. Methods In this prospective controlled study, segmental analysis of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and prospective ECG-triggered CCT was performed in 17 patients with LVNC and 19 healthy controls. In TTE maximal NC and C thickness was measured at enddiastole and endsystole in the segment with most prominent trabeculation in short axis views. In CCT, maximal segmental NC and C thickness was measured during diastole, and NC:C ratio was determined. Spearman’s correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated. Results The median [IQR] radiation dose was 1.3[1.2–1.5]mSv. The CCT thickness of the C layer was significantly lower in patients with LVNC as compared to controls in the inferolateral, midventricular, lateral-, inferior-, and septal-apical segments. The CCT NC:C ratio differed significantly between LVNC and controls in the inferior-midventricular and all the apical segments. NC:C ratio correlated significantly between TTE and CCT at enddiastole (σ = 0.8) and endsystole (σ = 0.9). Using a CCT NC:C ratio ≥1.8, all LVNC patients could be identified. Conclusion LVNC can be diagnosed with ECG-triggered low-dose CCT and discriminated from normal individuals using a NC:C ratio of ≥1.8 in diastole. There is a very good correlation of NC:C ratio in TTE and CCT."
https://openalex.org/W3041558764,"Although various previous studies have reported that the experimentally induced refractive errors interfered with postural control, few studies have demonstrated the optical correction effect of wearing glasses. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether wearing full corrected glasses to correct myopia and hyperopia can have a positive effect on postural stability. To this end, a total of 34 subjects (19 males and 15 females) of an average age of 22.38 ± 2.41-years-old participated in this study. After measuring the full corrected powers of refractive errors of subjects through subjective refraction, updated glasses were provided to 17 myopic subjects and first time glasses were provided to 17 hyperopic subjects as full corrected glasses, respectively. Postural evaluation was carried out using the TETRAX biofeedback system, after which we compared and analyzed the postural instability index and sway power index before and after wearing full corrected glasses. When updated and old glasses for correcting myopia were worn, the postural instability index was significantly reduced, and the sway power index was statistically decreased only in the mid-high frequency region associated with the somatic system, compared to the no glasses state, respectively. However, after wearing first time glasses for hyperopia correction, no significant difference was found in the postural instability index or sway power index. We suggest that providing optimal visual information through the optical correction of myopic refractive error is a useful approach that can lead to synergistic effects of somatic functions involved in postural control. Consequently, we demonstrated that wearing glasses to fully correct the refractive errors has a positive effect on increasing postural control in static posture. Our results may have important clinical implications in the field of optometry and balance evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3042118802,"Cholera remains a major global public health threat and continuous emergence of new Vibrio cholerae strains is of major concern. We conducted a molecular epidemiological study to detect virulence markers and antimicrobial resistance patterns of V. cholerae isolates obtained from the 2012-2015 cholera outbreaks in Ghana. Archived clinical isolates obtained from the 2012, 2014 and 2015 cholera outbreaks in Ghana were revived by culture and subjected to microscopy, biochemical identification, serotyping, antibiotic susceptibility testing, molecular detection of distinct virulence factors and Multi-Locus Variable-Number of Tandem-Repeat Analysis (MLVA). Of 277 isolates analysed, 168 (60.6%) were confirmed to be V. cholerae and 109 (39.4%) isolates constituted other bacteria (Escherichia coli, Aeromonas sobria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococci faecalis). Serotyping the V. cholerae isolates identified 151 (89.9%) as Ogawa, 3 (1.8%) as Inaba and 14 (8.3%) as non-O1/O139 serogroup. The O1 serogroup isolates (154/168, 91.7%) carried the cholera toxin ctxB gene as detected by PCR. Additional virulence genes detected include zot, tcpA, ace, rtxC, toxR, rtxA, tcpP, hlyA and tagA. The most common and rare virulence factors detected among the isolates were rtxC (165 isolates) and tcpP (50 isolates) respectively. All isolates from 2014 and 2015 were multidrug resistant against the selected antibiotics. MLVA differentiated the isolates into 2 large unique clones A and B, with each predominating in a particular year. Spatial analysis showed clustering of most isolates at Ablekuma sub-district. Identification of several virulence genes among the two different genotypes of V. cholerae isolates and resistance to first- and second-line antibiotics, calls for scaleup of preventive strategies to reduce transmission, and strengthening of public health laboratories for rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide accurate treatment. Our findings support the current WHO licensed cholera vaccines which include both O1 Inaba and Ogawa serotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3042169933,"Introduction Inflammation plays a major role in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) is a major receptor for lipopolysaccharides (endotoxin) and other ligands involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation. We determined whether endotoxin levels and the presence of TLR4 polymorphisms are associated with markers of inflammation and atherosclerosis among South African CKD patients. Materials and methods Endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), serum CD14 (sCD14), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) were measured in 160 participants (120 CKD patients and 40 controls). Associations between endotoxins and CIMT in the presence of sCD14, IL-8 and MCP-1, were assessed using odds ratios. Participants were screened for the presence of Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile TLR4 polymorphisms, and CIMT and inflammatory markers were compared between subjects with and without TLR4 polymorphisms. Results Endotoxin levels correlated with sCD14 (r = 0.441, p<0.001) and MCP-1 (r = 0.388, p<0.001) levels while increased CIMT was associated with MCP-1 (r = 0.448, p<0.001), sCD14 levels (r = 0.476, p<0.001), LBP (r = 0.340, p<0.001), and IL-8 (r = 0.395, p<0.001). Atherosclerosis was associated with endotoxin levels (odds ratio: 4.95; 95% confidence interval: 2.52–9.73; p<0.001), and was predicted by higher serum levels of inflammatory markers. Analysis of patients with TLR4 polymorphisms showed reduced serum levels of inflammatory markers and CIMT values compared with the patients carrying the wild type TLR4 alleles. Conclusion The study demonstrated associations between circulating endotoxaemia, systemic inflammation and accelerated atherosclerosis among South African CKD patients, and showed that the atherogenic predictive power of endotoxaemia was significantly increased by the presence of elevated levels of inflammatory markers. Additional findings, which must be confirmed, suggest that TLR4 polymorphisms are associated with low levels of inflammatory markers and CIMT values."
https://openalex.org/W3040954430,"A critical component of textbooks is fair representation of the material they cover. Within conservation biology, fair coverage is particularly important given Earth’s breadth of species and diversity of ecosystems. However, research on species tends to be biased towards certain taxonomic groups and geographic areas and their associated ecosystems, so it is possible that textbooks may exhibit similar biases. Considering the possibility of bias, our goal was to evaluate contemporary conservation biology textbooks to determine if they are representative of Earth’s biodiversity. We found that textbooks did not accurately reflect Earth’s biodiversity. Species, ecosystems, and continents were unevenly represented, few examples mentioned genetic diversity, and examples of negative human influence on the environment outweighed positive examples. However, in terms of aquatic versus terrestrial representation, textbooks presented a representative sample. Our findings suggest that modern conservation biology textbooks are biased in their coverage, which could have important consequences for educating our next generation of scientists and practitioners."
https://openalex.org/W3041743285,"The objective of this study was to identify the videogame-related experiences expressed by regular adolescent gamers and to explore the socio-family factors related to these experiences. A cross-sectional observational and descriptive study was carried out with a convenience sample of regular Spanish videogamers between 16 and 18 years old. To measure the use of videogames for evasion and its negative consequences, the Questionnaire of Videogame-Related Experiences (Cuestionario de Experiencias Relacionadas con Videojuegos, CERV) was used and socio-family variables collected, evaluating their relationship with the results of the CERV. A total of 206 adolescents participated, 89.3% men [84.3–93.2] and 17.9% [12.9–23.9] allocating more than 35 hours a week to videogames. The CERV subscale related to the evasive use of videogames (max. = 24 points) obtained a mean value of 11.71 (SD = 3.52) and the mean value for the subscale related to the negative consequences (max. = 27 points) was 7.14 (SD = 3.33). A higher frequency of high values of evasive use (p = .038) and higher scores of this subscale (p = .02) were found in gamers without brothers or sisters. Higher scores and larger numbers of negative consequences were found in gamers who play more than 21 hours a week (p = .032). In conclusion, frequent use of videogames does not seem to be carried out with an evasive purpose, except in the case of absence of siblings. Frequent videogame use has only proven to carry a higher level of negative consequences when playing more than 21 hours a week. No other socio-family variables related to these subscales of the CERV have been identified."
https://openalex.org/W3040861639,"Fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) allows for real -time analysis of phasic neurotransmitter levels. Tryptophan (TRP) is an aromatic amino acid responsible for facilitating electron transfer kinetics in oxidoreductase enzymes. Previous work with TRP-modified electrodes showed increased sensitivity for cyclic voltammetry detection of dopamine (DA) when used with slower scan rates (0.05 V/s). Here, we outline an in vitro proof of concept for TRP-modified electrodes in FSCV detection of DA, and decreased sensitivity for ascorbic acid (AA). TRP-modified electrodes had a limit of detection (LOD) for DA of 2.480 ± 0.343 nM compared to 8.348 ± 0.405 nM for an uncoated electrode. Selectivity for DA/ascorbic acid (AA) was 1.107 ± 0.3643 for uncoated and 15.57 ± 4.184 for TRP-modified electrodes. Additionally, these TRP-modified electrodes demonstrated reproducibility when exposed to extended cycling. TRP-modified electrodes will provide an effective modification to increase sensitivity for DA."
https://openalex.org/W3041653533,"Background In the literature, no studies describe the use of laparoscopic techniques for inguinal hernia repair in canine clinical patients. The surgical technique—Percutaneous Internal Ring Suturing (PIRS) presented in this article is the world's first minimally invasive laparoscopic surgical technique for inguinal canal closure in dogs. Aim The aim of the presented study is to evaluate the possibility of employment of the laparoscopic PIRS technique in clinical practice as well as to technically evaluate its usefulness in the treatment of the inguinal hernia in dogs. The presented study describes the procedure and the results of laparoscopic treatment of 11 inguinal hernias in nine dogs (two bilateral). Methods The whole procedure is performed under camera control introduced through one umbilical trocar. The very closure of the inner inguinal ring is done with the injection needle by a small puncture over the inguinal canal with the help of which the suture material is inserted, and the canal of the operated inguinal hernia is closed. Each operated dog underwent a thorough clinical examination before surgery which was combined with ultrasound examination of the inguinal canals before, immediately after and three months after surgery. Results There was no hernia recurrence in the study period in the operated dogs and all individuals returned to full mobility immediately after recovery from anesthesia. Conclusions Due to the low invasiveness and simplicity of performance, the PIRS technique described in the study should be taken into account when choosing a treatment method for non-traumatic inguinal hernia in dogs. At the same time, the possibility of using the described technique in other types of inguinal hernia in dogs requires further research."

As a routinely tested virus in Chinese blood bank systems, rare molecular epidemiology research in blood donors is reported. Our purpose is to investigate the HCV GT/subtypes distribution, phylogenetic analysis and population genetics in Chinese blood donors. Anti-HCV screen positive samples and donor demographics were collected. HCV Core and E1 gene fragments were amplified by RT-PCR, followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to determine HCV GTs/subtypes using MEGA 7.0. The population genetics were performed using Arlequin v3.0 and Beast v1.10.4. SPSS Statistics 17.0 software was used to analyze the correlation between HCV GTs/subtypes distribution and demographic characteristics. 419 and 293 samples based on Core and E1 gene respectively were successfully amplified. HCV la, lb, 2a, 3a, 3b, 6a, 6e and 6n were found, and the corresponding proportions were 0.66% (3/455), 58.68% (267/455), 17.80% (81/455) and 5.05% (23/455), 3.52% (16/455), 12.31% (56/455), 0.88% (4/455) and 0.66% (3/455). Samples from Guangxi showed the most abundant genetic diversity with 8 subtypes were found. The number of haplotypes in HCV-1b is higher than 2a and 6a. The negative Tajima's D and Fu's Fs values of HCV-1b, 2a and 6a suggested the population expansion of those HCV subtypes. The distribution of HCV GT showed significant statistical difference by age and ethnicity. Conclusion: An abundance of HCV genetic diversity was found in Chinese blood donors with mainly 1b and then 2a subtype. There were significant geographical and demographic differences in HCV GTs/subtypes among Chinese blood donors. HCV subtype 1b has stronger viability and HCV subtype 6a has experienced significant expansion."
https://openalex.org/W3041875690,"With the global problem of aging, it has become more difficult to improve the prognosis of older dialysis patients. Extended-hours hemodialysis offers longer treatment time compared to conventional hemodialysis regimen and provides favorable metabolic status, hemodynamic stability, and increased dietary intake. Despite prior studies reporting that in-center extended-hours hemodialysis can reduce the mortality rate, the treatment impact on elderly patients remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the association between extended-hours hemodialysis compared to conventional hemodialysis and all-cause mortality. Survival analyses using Cox proportional hazard model with multivariable adjustments and propensity-score based method were performed to compare mortality risk between 198 consecutive patients who started in-center extended-hours hemodialysis (Extended-HD) and 1407 consecutive patients who initiated conventional hemodialysis. The median age was 67.1 years in the Extended-HD group and 70.7 years in the conventional hemodialysis group. Extended-HD was associated with lower all-cause mortality in overall patients and the subgroup >70 years (adjusted hazard ratios of 0.60 [95% CI, 0.39–0.91] and 0.35 [95% CI, 0.18–0.69], respectively). There was a significant interaction between age >70 years and Extended-HD. In conclusion, extended-hours hemodialysis was associated with a lower mortality rate, especially in elderly patients."
https://openalex.org/W3041240531,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is the most economically important infectious disease of pigs worldwide. Our previous study revealed that Tongcheng (TC) pigs display higher resistance to PRRS than Largewhite (LW) pigs, but the genetic mechanism remains unknown. Here, we first confirmed that CXCL14 was downregulated in lungs and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) responding to PRRS virus (PRRSV) infection, but the decline in LW pigs was more obvious than that in TC pigs. Then, we found that the overexpression of CXCL14 activated type-I interferon (IFN-I) signaling by upregulating interferon beta (IFNB), which plays a major role in the antiviral effect. To further decipher the mechanism underlying its differential expression, we characterized the core promoter of CXCL14 as being located from −145 to 276 bp of the transcription start site (TSS) and identified two main haplotypes that displayed significant differential transcriptional activities. We further identified two coupled point mutations that altered the binding status of CEBPB and were responsible for the differential expression in TC and LW pigs. The regulatory effect of CEBPB on CXCL14 was further confirmed by RNA interference (RNAi) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), providing crucial clues for deciphering the mechanism of CXCL14 downregulation in unusual conditions. The present study revealed the potential antiviral effect of CXCL14, occurring via activation of interferon signaling, and suggested that CXCL14 contributes to the PRRS resistance of TC pigs."
https://openalex.org/W3041571460,"Freshwater wetlands of the temperate north are exposed to a range of pollutants that may alter their function, including nitrogen (N)-rich agricultural and urban runoff, seawater intrusion, and road salt contamination, though it is largely unknown how these drivers of change interact with the vegetation to affect wetland carbon (C) fluxes and microbial communities. We implemented a full factorial mesocosm (378.5 L tanks) experiment investigating C-related responses to three common wetland plants of eastern North America (Phragmites australis, Spartina pectinata, Typha latifolia), and four water quality treatments (fresh water control, N, road salt, sea salt). During the 2017 growing season, we quantified carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes, above- and below-ground biomass, root porosity, light penetration, pore water chemistry (NH4+, NO3-, SO4-2, Cl-, DOC), soil C mineralization, as well as sediment microbial communities via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Relative to freshwater controls, N enrichment stimulated plant biomass, which in turn increased CO2 uptake and reduced light penetration, especially in Spartina stands. Root porosity was not affected by water quality, but was positively correlated with CH4 emissions, suggesting that plants can be important conduits for CH4 from anoxic sediment to the atmosphere. Sediment microbial composition was largely unaffected by N addition, whereas salt amendments induced structural shifts, reduced sediment community diversity, and reduced C mineralization rates, presumably due to osmotic stress. Methane emissions were suppressed by sea salt, but not road salt, providing evidence for the additional chemical control (SO4-2 availability) on this microbial-mediated process. Thus, N may have stimulated plant activity while salting treatments preferentially enriched specific microbial populations. Together our findings underpin the utility of combining plant and microbial responses, and highlight the need for more integrative studies to predict the consequences of a changing environment on freshwater wetlands."

This study investigated the practice patterns of PTNB of the lung and assessed the incidence and risk factors of PTNB-related severe pneumothorax in Korea.We used a national-level health insurance database between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2015. Patients who underwent PTNB of the lung were identified using procedure codes for organ biopsy, fluoroscopy, computed tomography, chest radiography, and lung-related diagnosis codes. The annual age-/sex-standardized rate of PTNB and the incidence of PTNB-related severe pneumothorax were calculated. We defined severe pneumothorax as the pneumothorax requiring intervention. The odds ratios of risk factors were assessed by a generalized estimating equation model with exchangeable working correlation matrix to address clustering effect within institution.A total of 66,754 patients were identified between 2007 and 2015. The annual age-/sex-standardized rate of PTNB per 100,000 population was 19.6 in 2007 and 22.4 in 2015, and it showed an increasing trend. The incidence of severe pneumothorax was 2.4% overall: 2.5% in men and 1.2% in women, and 2.6%, 2.7%, 2.1%, 2.1%, 1.9%, 2.4%, and 2.4% from 2009 to 2015. Older age (≥60), male sex, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, receiving treatment in an urban or rural area versus a metropolitan area, and receiving treatment at a general hospital were significantly associated with the risk of severe pneumothorax.Considering the increasing trend of PTNB, more attention needs to be paid to patients with risk factors for severe pneumothorax."

Efficacy was assessed 1 month later. Best-corrected far/near visual acuity (BCFVA/BCNVA), MNREAD parameters (reading acuity [RA], maximum reading speed [MRS], critical print size [CPS]), CGS (CS/GS), and central macular thickness (CMT) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) before and after treatment were evaluated. The area (superior/inferior) affected by BRVO was determined by fluorescein angiography.All parameters improved significantly following treatment (p < 0.05), and all MNREAD and CGS parameters were significantly correlated with BCVA in the treated eye before and after treatment (p < 0.01). The changes in BCFVA, BCNVA, MRS, and CS were significantly correlated with the amount of change in CMT (p < 0.007; r = 0.415, 0.528, -0.465, and -0.508, respectively). MRS exhibited a percentage change that was significantly correlated with that in CMT (p < 0.007; r = -0.511). Additionally, MRS exhibited the lowest threshold CMT (397 μm) at which the most significant change in improvement was observed. CMT was less likely to improve if BRVO occurred at a superior site than if it occurred at an inferior site (0.05 < p = 0.07 < 0.1).MNREAD and CGS testing were useful for evaluating BRVO treatment efficacy. MRS might be a valuable index for evaluating treatment success and making treatment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3041825088,"Nephrotoxicity severely limits the chemotherapeutic efficacy of cisplatin (CDDP). Oxidative stress is associated with CDDP-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Methylglyoxal (MG) forms advanced glycation end products that elevate oxidative stress. We aimed to explore the role of MG and its metabolite D-lactate and identify the proteins involved in CDDP-induced AKI. Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally administered CDDP (5 mg/kg/day) for 3 or 5 days. Blood urea nitrogen (42.6 ± 7.4 vs. 18.3 ± 2.5; p < 0.05) and urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide (NAG; 4.89 ± 0.61 vs. 2.43 ± 0.31 U/L; p < 0.05) were significantly elevated in the CDDP 5-day group compared to control mice. Histological analysis confirmed AKI was successfully induced. Confocal microscopy revealed TNF-α was significantly increased in the CDDP 5-day group. Fluorogenic derivatized liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (FD-LC-MS/MS) showed the kidney MG (36.25 ± 1.68 vs. 18.95 ± 2.24 mg/g protein, p < 0.05) and D-lactate (1.78 ± 0.29 vs. 1.12 ± 0.06 mol/g protein, p < 0.05) contents were significantly higher in the CDDP 5-day group than control group.

They were run at normal or real-time priority processing in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Internet Explorer on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Timing accuracies were compared with that of Psychtoolbox which was chosen as gold standard. It was found that rAF with real-time priority had the best timing accuracy compared to the other web technologies and had a similar timing accuracy as Psychtoolbox in traditional experiments in most cases. However, rAF exhibited poor timing accuracy on Linux. Therefore, rAF can be used as technical basis for accuracy of millisecond timing sequences in online experiments, thereby benefiting the psychology field."

Surprisingly, reports have indicated that there is increasing number of women resuming menstruation within six weeks of childbirth (puerperal menstruation). To the best of knowledge, there is no prior study on predictors of puerperal menstruation.To determine frequency and predictors of puerperal menstruation.This was a single tertiary health institution cross-sectional study at ESUT Teaching Hospital, Parklane, Enugu, Nigeria that included data from May 2015 to December 2018. Women were interviewed at the end of the first six weeks of their childbirth. Women with HIV positive or had uterine rupture or peripartum hysterectomy were excluded. Bivariate analysis was performed by the chi-squared test and conditional logistic regression analysis was used to determine variables associated with puerperal menstruation. Statistical significance was accepted when P- value is <0.05.A total of 371 women met the inclusion criteria. The return of menses within 6 weeks was present in 118(31.8%) women versus 253 (68.2%) women without puerperal menstruation, given a ratio of 1:3. Of the 371 women, 249 (67.1%) were on exclusive breastfeeding. The significant associated risk factors were age (p = 0.009), parity (p<0.001), early use of family planning (p = 0.001), socio-economic status (p<0.001) and manual removal of placenta (p = 0.007). At conditional logistic regression analysis, early use of family planning (p = 0.001), exclusive breastfeeding (p = 0.027) and manual removal of placenta (p = 0.012) were independently associated with puerperal menstruation. Induction/augmentation of labor, postpartum misoprostol use and mode of delivery were not statistically significant (p>0.05, for all).One in 3 women resumes menstruation within 6 weeks of childbirth. The major predictor was early initiation of family planning, and exclusive breastfeeding with manual removal of placenta a major protective factor. These interesting issues require further investigation to better understand the mechanism of puerperal menstruation."
https://openalex.org/W3040885253,"Recent debates on insect decline require sound assessments on the relative drivers that may negatively impact insect populations. Often, baseline data rely on insect monitorings that integrate catches over long time periods. If, however, effects of time-critical environmental factors (e.g., light pollution) are of interest, higher temporal resolution of insect data is required during very specific time intervals (e.g., between dusk and dawn). Conventional time-critical insect trapping is labour-intensive (manual activation/deactivation) and temporally inaccurate as not all traps can be serviced synchronically at different sites. Also, temporal shifts of environmental conditions (e.g., sunset/sunrise) are not accounted for. We present a battery-driven automated insect flight-interception trap which samples insects during seven user-defined time intervals. A commercially available flight-interception trap is fitted to a turntable containing eight positions, seven of them holding cups and one consisting of a pass-through hole. While the cups sample insects during period of interest, the pass-through hole avoids unwanted sampling during time-intervals not of interest. Comparisons between two manual and two automated traps during 71 nights in 2018 showed no difference in caught insects. A study using 20 automated traps during 104 nights in 2019 proved that the automated flight-interception traps are reliable. The automated trap opens new research and application possibilities as arbitrary insect-sampling intervals can be defined. The trap proves efficient, saving manpower and associated costs as activation/deactivation is required only every seven sampling intervals. In addition, the timing of the traps is accurate, as all traps sample at exactly the same intervals and ensure comparability. The automated trap is low maintenance and robust due to straightforward technical design. It can be controlled manually or via smartphone through a Bluetooth connection. Full construction details are given in Appendices."

Since a specification that is poorly aligned with the inventive claims can render an invention unpatentable and can invalidate an already issued patent, an effective measure of alignment is necessary. We define a novel measure of drafting alignment using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The measure is defined for each patent document by first identifying the latent topics underlying the claims and the specification, and then using the Hellinger distance to find the proximity between the topical coverages. We demonstrate the use of the novel measure for data processing patent documents related to cybersecurity. The properties of the proposed measure are further investigated using exploratory data analysis, and it is shown that generally alignment is positively associated with the prior patenting efforts as well as the tendency to include figures in a document."
https://openalex.org/W3041282473,"The genetic diversity of North American soybean cultivars has been largely influenced by a small number of ancestors. High yielding breeding lines that possess exotic pedigrees have been developed, but identifying beneficial exotic alleles has been difficult as a result of complex interactions of yield alleles with genetic backgrounds and environments as well as the highly quantitative nature of yield. PI 416937 has been utilized in the development of many high yielding lines that have been entered into the USDA Southern States Uniform Tests over the past ~20 years. The primary goal of this research was to identify genomic regions under breeding selection from PI 416937 and introduce a methodology for identifying and potentially utilizing beneficial diversity from lines prevalent in the ancestry of elite cultivars. Utilizing SoySNP50K Infinium BeadChips, 52 high yielding PI 416937-derived lines as well as their parents were genotyped to identify PI 416937 alleles under breeding selection. Nine genomic regions across three chromosomes and 17 genomic regions across seven chromosomes were identified where PI 416937 alleles were under positive or negative selection. Minimal significant associations between PI 416937 alleles and yield were observed in replicated yield trials of five RIL populations, highlighting the difficulty of consistently detecting yield associations."

However, the latest methods perform poorly in areas with dense textures. To better recover the areas with dense textures in video frames and improve the visual perception quality and coherence in videos, this paper proposes a multiresolution mixture generative adversarial network for video super-resolution (MRMVSR). We propose a multiresolution mixture network (MRMNet) as the generative network that can simultaneously generate multiresolution feature maps. In MRMNet, the high-resolution (HR) feature maps can continuously extract information from low-resolution (LR) feature maps to supplement information. In addition, we propose a residual fluctuation loss function for video super-resolution. The residual fluctuation loss function is used to reduce the overall residual fluctuation on SR and HR video frames to avoid a scenario where local differences are too large. Experimental results on the public benchmark dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for the majority of the test sets."
https://openalex.org/W3041907796,"The mosquito Culex erythrothorax Dyar is a West Nile virus (WNV) vector that breeds in wetlands with emergent vegetation. Urbanization and recreational activities near wetlands place humans, birds and mosquitoes in close proximity, increasing the risk of WNV transmission. Adult Cx. erythrothorax abundance peaked in a wetland bordering the San Francisco Bay of California (USA) during the first 3 hours after sunset (5527 ± 4070 mosquitoes / trap night) while peak adult Culex tarsalis Coquillett abundance occurred during the subsequent 3 h period (83 ± 30 Cx. tarsalis). When insecticide resistance was assessed using bottle bioassay, Cx. erythrothorax was highly sensitive to permethrin, naled, and etofenprox insecticides compared to a strain of Culex pipiens that is susceptible to insecticides (LC50 = 0.35, 0.71, and 4.1 μg/bottle, respectively). The Cx. erythrothorax were 2.8-fold more resistant to resmethrin, however, the LC50 value was low (0.68 μg/bottle). Piperonyl butoxide increased the toxicity of permethrin (0.5 μg/bottle) and reduced knock down time, but a higher permethrin concentration (2.0 μg/bottle) did not have similar effects. Bulk mixed-function oxidase, alpha-esterase, or beta-esterase activities in mosquito homogenates were higher in Cx. erythrothorax relative to the Cx. pipiens susceptible strain. There was no difference in the activity of glutathione S-transferase between the two mosquito species and insensitive acetylcholine esterase was not detected. Larvicides that were applied to the site had limited impact on reducing mosquito abundance. Subsequent removal of emergent vegetation in concert with larvicide applications and reduced daily environmental temperature substantially reduced mosquito abundance. To control Cx. erythrothorax in wetlands, land managers should consider vegetation removal so that larvicide can efficiently enter the water. Vector control agencies may more successfully control adult viremic Cx. erythrothorax that enter nearby neighborhoods by applying adulticides during the 3 h that follow sunset."
