To explore this difference, we comprehensively identified each area's monosynaptic inputs using the rabies virus. We show that dopamine neurons in both areas integrate inputs from a more diverse collection of areas than previously thought, including autonomic, motor, and somatosensory areas. SNc and VTA dopamine neurons receive contrasting excitatory inputs: the former from the somatosensory/motor cortex and subthalamic nucleus, which may explain their short-latency responses to salient events; and the latter from the lateral hypothalamus, which may explain their involvement in value coding. We demonstrate that neurons in the striatum that project directly to dopamine neurons form patches in both the dorsal and ventral striatum, whereas those projecting to GABAergic neurons are distributed in the matrix compartment. Neuron-type-specific connectivity lays a foundation for studying how dopamine neurons compute outputs.

Tracing direct inputs to midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons using rabies virus DA neurons receive direct inputs from autonomic, motor and somatosensory areas Direct cortical and subthalamic inputs may explain short-latency excitation of SNc The largest numbers of direct inputs come from dorsal and ventral striatum patches A central goal of neuroscience is to understand brain function in terms of interactions among a network of diverse types of neurons. A critical step is to understand the inputs and outputs of a given type of neuron in an intact network. Electrophysiological and optical imaging techniques have advanced our understanding of outputs, but our progress in understanding the nature of inputs has been slow. Establishing methods to efficiently identify inputs to a given type of neuron will facilitate our understanding of how neurons communicate. Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) play pivotal roles in various brain functions including motivation, reinforcement learning, and motor control (Cohen et al., 2012Cohen J.Y.

Neurosci. 2004; 5: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies have shown that dopamine neurons are activated phasically (100–500 ms) by unpredicted reward or sensory cues that predict reward (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010Bromberg-Martin E.S. Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O.

Dayan P. Montague P.R. A neural substrate of prediction and reward.Science. 1997; 275: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5893) Google Scholar). In contrast, they do not respond to fully predicted reward, and their activity is transiently suppressed by negative outcomes (e.g., when a predicted reward is omitted or the animal expects or receives negative outcomes). Thus, dopamine neurons appear to calculate the difference between the expected and actual reward (i.e., reward prediction errors). Reward prediction error may not be the only function of dopamine neurons, however. For example, several studies have suggested that dopamine neurons are activated by noxious stimuli (Brischoux et al., 2009Brischoux F. Chakraborty S. Brierley D.I.

Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Indeed, a recent study in nonhuman primates found at least two types of dopamine neurons, saliency coding and value coding, that are activated and inhibited, respectively, by aversive events (Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O. Two types of dopamine neuron distinctly convey positive and negative motivational signals.Nature. 2009; 459: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Importantly, saliency-coding dopamine neurons were found preferentially in the dorsolateral part of the midbrain dopamine nuclei (i.e., mainly SNc) while reward-value-coding dopamine neurons were found in the more ventromedial part (i.e., mainly VTA). Furthermore, responses in SNc were generally earlier than those in VTA. These findings raise the possibility that inputs encoding noxious stimuli or saliency specifically innervate SNc dopamine neurons. Although efforts have been made to identify the sources of such inputs, they remain unidentified (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010Bromberg-Martin E.S. Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O.

More generally, although the aforementioned findings indicate that dopamine neurons integrate diverse kinds of information, the mechanisms by which the firing of dopamine neurons is regulated in a behavioral context remain largely unknown (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010Bromberg-Martin E.S.

Cortico-basal ganglia reward network: microcircuitry.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2010; 35: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). A critical step toward understanding the aforementioned questions is to know what kinds of inputs dopamine neurons in the VTA and SNc receive. Circuit-tracing experiments have been performed to address this question (Geisler et al., 2007Geisler S. Derst C. Veh R.W. Zahm D.S.

Neurol. 2011; 519: 3159-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but limitations of conventional tracing methods have hampered a full understanding of inputs to dopamine neurons. For example, conventional tracing cannot distinguish between dopaminergic and nondopaminergic cells (e.g., GABAergic neurons). Furthermore, SNc dopamine neurons form a thin layer and are heavily interconnected with the neighboring substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and conventional tracing might label inputs to SNr in addition to SNc. Finally, there are many axons of passage through or near these structures, which may take up tracers nonspecifically. Thus, it is unclear whether neurons in a given area project to VTA or SNc and whether they actually make synaptic contacts with dopamine neurons. Electron microscopy can resolve several of these issues (e.g., Bolam and Smith, 1990Bolam J.P. Smith Y.

Another approach is to combine anatomical methods with electrophysiological or optogenetic techniques (Chuhma et al., 2011Chuhma N. Tanaka K.F. Hen R. Rayport S.

To resolve these methodological issues, we combined the Cre/loxP gene expression system (Gong et al., 2007Gong S. Doughty M. Harbaugh C.R. Cummins A. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. Gerfen C.R. Targeting Cre recombinase to specific neuron populations with bacterial artificial chromosome constructs.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9817-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) with rabies-virus-based transsynaptic retrograde tracing (Wickersham et al., 2007bWickersham I.R. Lyon D.C. Barnard R.J. Mori T. Finke S. Conzelmann K.K. Young J.A. Callaway E.M.

Cetin A. De La Parra M. Callaway E.M. Monosynaptic circuit tracing in vivo through Cre-dependent targeting and complementation of modified rabies virus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 21848-21853Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This technique allowed us to identify the sources of monosynaptic inputs to VTA and SNc dopamine neurons in the entire brain. We then asked whether we can identify different sources of candidate excitatory inputs that may account for rapid activation of SNc dopamine neurons by salient events, in contrast to activation of VTA dopamine neurons by reward values, and whether there are indeed direct projections from the striatum to dopamine neurons. We show that SNc dopamine neurons receive relatively strong excitatory inputs from the somatosensory and motor cortices, as well as subthalamic nucleus (STh), whereas VTA dopamine neurons receive strong inputs from the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Furthermore, we show that neurons in the striatum project directly to VTA and SNc dopamine neurons, forming “patch” compartments in both the ventral striatum (VS) and dorsal striatum (DS). We used the modified rabies virus SADΔG-GFP(EnvA), which has two key modifications that determine the specificity of its initial infection and transsynaptic spread (Wickersham et al., 2007bWickersham I.R. Lyon D.C. Barnard R.J. Mori T. Finke S. Conzelmann K.K. Young J.A. Callaway E.M. Monosynaptic restriction of transsynaptic tracing from single, genetically targeted neurons.Neuron. 2007; 53: 639-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). First, this virus is pseudotyped with an avian virus envelope protein (EnvA) and therefore cannot infect mammalian cells. In mammalian brains, the initial infection thus occurs only when a host neuron is engineered to express a cognate receptor (e.g., TVA). Second, the gene for the rabies virus envelope glycoprotein (RG), which is required for transsynaptic spread, is replaced by the gene for a fluorescent marker (enhanced green fluorescent protein; EGFP). Transsynaptic transfer thus occurs only from neurons that exogenously express RG. Our strategy was to express TVA and RG only in a genetically defined cell population (Haubensak et al., 2010Haubensak W. Kunwar P.S. Cai H. Ciocchi S. Wall N.R. Ponnusamy R. Biag J. Dong H.W.

USA. 2010; 107: 21848-21853Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, we generated adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) that express either TVA or RG (AAV5-FLEX-TVA-mCherry and AAV8-FLEX-RG, respectively). We used the transmembrane type of the TVA receptor protein (TVA950) to generate a fusion protein with a red fluorescent protein (mCherry). TVA and RG proteins were expressed under the control of a high-specificity Cre/loxP recombination system (a modified Flex switch) and different promoters (EF-1α and CAG, respectively) (Figure 1A). To visualize monosynaptic inputs to dopamine neurons, we injected AAV5-FLEX-TVA-mCherry and AAV8-FLEX-RG stereotaxically into VTA or SNc of transgenic mice that express Cre in dopamine neurons (dopamine transporter-Cre or DAT-Cre) (Bäckman et al., 2006Bäckman C.M. Malik N. Zhang Y. Shan L. Grinberg A. Hoffer B.J. Westphal H. Tomac A.C. Characterization of a mouse strain expressing Cre recombinase from the 3′ untranslated region of the dopamine transporter locus.Genesis. 2006; 44: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). After 14 days, SADΔG-GFP(EnvA) was injected into the same area and the brain was analyzed after 7 days (Figure 1B). The whole brain was sectioned at 100 μm, and every third section was processed for further analysis. The starter cells were identified based on the coexpression of TVA-mCherry and EGFP (Figures 1C and 1H; Figure S1 available online). Coexpressing neurons were found only in the injected area, while EGFP-positive neurons outside the injected area did not express TVA-mCherry, indicating that they are transsynaptically labeled neurons. We found a large number of these transsynaptically labeled neurons (Figure 1D;6.1 × 103 ± 4.2 × 103 neurons; mean ± SD, n = 12 mice), although the number of labeled neurons varied across animals, in part due to different injection volumes (Figures 1E and 1F). Nevertheless, the numbers of transsynaptically labeled neurons were roughly proportional to the numbers of starter neurons (Figure 1G). To examine the specificity of tracing, we first repeated the aforementioned procedure in mice with no Cre expression (Figure 1D, right). This resulted in much smaller numbers of EGFP-labeled neurons both outside and near the injection site (87 ± 61 neurons outside VTA or SNc and 31 ± 21 neurons in VTA or SNc; mean ± SD) compared to the aforementioned result. This small degree of labeling was likely due to inevitable contamination of the unpseudotyped rabies virus that occurred during the viral preparation. Note that these numbers should be regarded as the upper bounds of nonspecific labeling, as some of the labeled neurons are likely dopamine neurons and their inputs. Next, to examine the specificity of the initial infection and to verify that the transsynaptic spread is under the tight control of RG expression, we repeated the experiment without AAV8-FLEX-RG in DAT-Cre mice. A larger number of labeled neurons were found at the injection site, and 97% of the labeled neurons coexpressed tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for dopamine neurons. Furthermore, very few neurons were found outside the injection site. This result confirms that the TVA proteins were expressed specifically in Cre-expressing neurons and that transsynaptic spread did not occur without RG protein. Together, these results suggest that labeled neurons outside the injection site represent monosynaptic inputs to dopamine neurons, while the injection site contains a small number of nonspecifically labeled neurons that contributed very little labeling outside the injection site (∼1.3%). In the following analysis, we will focus on labeled neurons outside the injection site. Figure 2 shows the sections obtained from two mice that were administered the selective injections into VTA and SNc (v001 and s003; see Figure 1H). Using custom software, we identified anatomical areas based on a standard mouse atlas (Franklin and Paxinos, 2008Franklin B.J. Paxinos G. The mouse brain in stereotaxic coordinates. Compact third eddition. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2008Google Scholar) using fluorescent Nissl staining; the location of each neuron was registered on the anatomical coordinate. We then counted the number of neurons in each area. To correct for the variability in the total number of neurons, the numbers were normalized by the total number of input neurons (Figure 3, left; Figure S2). We further computed the density of labeled neurons in each area by dividing the number by the area (mm2) on each section (Figure 3, right). For each group, four animals that had preferential injections into VTA or SNc were used to generate Figure 3 (v009, v001, v010, and v004 for VTA; and s001, s004, s003, and s006 for SNc; note that v008 and v007 were not included because these mice had a small number of labeled neurons). Consistent results were obtained even when we restricted our analysis to three animals with higher specificity for each group. Furthermore, we have verified that the patterns of labeling are similar at 5 days (n = 3 mice, VTA) and 9 days (n = 2 mice, VTA) after the injection of SADΔG-GFP(EnvA) compared to the main data set obtained at 7 days after injection (Pearson correlations for the mean numbers of labeled neurons across areas were r = 0.82 and 0.95 between 5 versus 7 days and 7 versus 9 days, respectively; p < 10−7 for both). This suggests that the results we report here are temporally stable and not affected by gross cell death over time.Figure 3Comparison of Input Areas between VTA and SNc Dopamine NeuronsShow full caption(Left) Number of input neurons in each area.

Across the whole brain, the most abundant labeling was found in the basal ganglia (striatum and pallidum) (Figure 3). In these areas, labeled neurons are predominantly found ipsilateral to the injection site (e.g., Figure 1D). Both for VTA- and SNc-targeted animals, labeled neurons formed continuous bands that ran from the striatum to specific hypothalamic areas (Figure 2). The densely labeled bands for VTA and SNc dopamine neurons showed rough segregation such that the areas projecting to SNc dopamine neurons were found in the more dorsal and lateral parts in this continuum, relative to those projecting to VTA dopamine neurons (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). These bands often did not reflect the boundaries of anatomically identified areas (Franklin and Paxinos, 2008Franklin B.J. Paxinos G. The mouse brain in stereotaxic coordinates. Compact third eddition. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2008Google Scholar), but the densely labeled regions included various areas in the striatum and pallidum and, more posteriorly, the basal forebrain and hypothalamus (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). In terms of numbers, the most prominent labeling was observed in the striatum partly due to its large volume, with greater emphasis on the ventral portion (nucleus accumbens [Acb] and olfactory tubercle [Tu]) in VTA-targeted mice and on the DS in SNc-targeted mice. In the amygdala, the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce; in particular, the lateral central nucleus of amygdala [CeL]) was found to project to both VTA and SNc dopamine neurons (e.g., Figures 4D and 4E) while other amygdala regions, including the cortical amygdala, did not project much to dopamine neurons in either area. In pallidal areas, more ventral and medial structures such as the ventral pallidum (VP) and sublenticular extended amygdala (EA) project predominantly to VTA dopamine neurons, whereas more dorsal and lateral structures such as the globus pallidus (GP) and entopeduncular nucleus (EP) project predominantly to SNc dopamine neurons (Figures 4A–4C). The bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST; in particular, its dorsal lateral division [STLD]) projects to both VTA and SNc (Figure S6A). From the basal forebrain and hypothalamic areas, VTA dopamine neurons receive the greatest input from the LH (including the peduncular part of the lateral hypothalamus [PLH]). VTA dopamine neurons also receive inputs from scattered neurons in the diagonal band of Broca (DB) and medial and lateral preoptic areas (MPA and LPO) (Figures 3, 4A, 4D, and S3C). In these areas, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (Pa) is unique in that it contains densely labeled neurons, for both VTA- and SNc-targeted cases (Figure S6B). In contrast, in SNc-targeted cases, fewer neurons were labeled in hypothalamic areas except Pa, while the STh contained a dense collection of neurons that project preferentially to SNc dopamine neurons (Figures 4D–4F). Para-STh (PSTh) and zona incerta project both to VTA and SNc dopamine neurons with a slight bias to VTA. Together, these results show that VTA and SNc dopamine"

They show that BAP1 binds to HCF-1 and suppresses cell proliferation, and they find that BAP1 loss is associated with high tumor grade. The molecular pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is poorly understood. Whole-genome and exome sequencing followed by innovative tumorgraft analyses (to accurately determine mutant allele ratios) identified several putative two-hit tumor suppressor genes, including BAP1. The BAP1 protein, a nuclear deubiquitinase, is inactivated in 15% of clear cell RCCs. BAP1 cofractionates with and binds to HCF-1 in tumorgrafts. Mutations disrupting the HCF-1 binding motif impair BAP1-mediated suppression of cell proliferation but not deubiquitination of monoubiquitinated histone 2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1). BAP1 loss sensitizes RCC cells in vitro to genotoxic stress. Notably, mutations in BAP1 and PBRM1 anticorrelate in tumors (P = 3 × 10−5), and combined loss of BAP1 and PBRM1 in a few RCCs was associated with rhabdoid features (q = 0.0007). BAP1 and PBRM1 regulate seemingly different gene expression programs, and BAP1 loss was associated with high tumor grade (q = 0.0005). Our results establish the foundation for an integrated pathological and molecular genetic classification of RCC, paving the way for subtype-specific treatments exploiting genetic vulnerabilities."

It is incompletely understood how the Axin1 complex exerts its Wnt-regulated function. Here, we examine the mechanism of Wnt signaling under endogenous levels of the Axin1 complex. Our results demonstrate that β-catenin is not only phosphorylated inside the Axin1 complex, but also ubiquinated and degraded via the proteasome, all within an intact Axin1 complex. In disagreement with current views, we find neither a disassembly of the complex nor an inhibition of phosphorylation of Axin1-bound β-catenin upon Wnt signaling. Similar observations are made in primary intestinal epithelium and in colorectal cancer cell lines carrying activating Wnt pathway mutations. Wnt signaling suppresses β-catenin ubiquitination normally occurring within the complex, leading to complex saturation by accumulated phospho-β-catenin. Subsequently, newly synthesized β-catenin can accumulate in a free cytosolic form and engage nuclear TCF transcription factors.

Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in development and disease.Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4491) Google Scholar). Deregulation of this pathway occurs in cancer and underlies multiple hereditary syndromes (Clevers, 2006Clevers H.

Wnt/beta-catenin signaling: components, mechanisms, and diseases.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 9-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). The key regulatory step involves the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation of its downstream effector protein, β-catenin, by a dedicated cytoplasmic destruction complex. This complex consists of the central scaffold protein Axin and three other core components, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and the kinases glycogen synthase kinase-3 alpha/beta (GSK-3) and casein kinase-1 (CKI). Mutations in components of the β-catenin destruction complex (APC, AXIN, or β-catenin) result in cancer (Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1996Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

In resting cells, despite the gene being continuously transcribed, vanishingly low levels of free β-catenin protein are present in the cytosol. This pool of β-catenin is efficiently captured by the destruction complex and phosphorylated by CKI at Ser45, which in turn primes GSK3 phosphorylation of β-catenin on the more N-terminal Thr41, Ser37, and Ser33 residues (Liu et al., 2002Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X.

Phosphorylated β-catenin is ubiquitinated by the F-box-containing protein β-TrCP ubiquitin E3 ligase to be degraded by the proteasome (Aberle et al., 1997Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A.

Axin1 is the rate-limiting factor of the destruction complex (Lee et al., 2003Lee E. Salic A. Kruger R. Heinrich R. Kirschner M.W. The roles of APC and Axin derived from experimental and theoretical analysis of the Wnt pathway.PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E10Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Axin1 directly interacts with all other core components of the destruction complex (β-catenin, APC, CKα, and GSK3), thus being the central scaffold of the complex (Ikeda et al., 1998Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A.

USA. 1998; 95: 3020-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). As the least abundant component, Axin1 can regulate its rapid assembly and disassembly. For this reason, it has been proposed that degradation of Axin1 in Wnt-activated cells may be the immediate cause of β-catenin stabilization (Mao et al., 2001Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr III, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D. Li L. Wu D. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 binds to Axin and regulates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.Mol.

Although multiple roles have been proposed for the genetically essential APC protein, there is no consensus as to its key activity. Wnt ligands bind to the frizzled (FZD) and low-density-lipoprotein-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) coreceptor complex to activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Through an incompletely resolved mechanism that involves Dishevelled, the activated receptor complex disrupts or functionally inactivates the destruction complex, leading to the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. In the nucleus, β-catenin engages TCF/LEF transcription factors to activate the Wnt transcriptional program (Molenaar et al., 1996Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J. Godsave S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destrée O. Clevers H.

Several models describe the events following Wnt receptor activation that lead to stabilization of β-catenin. Sequestration of Axin1 by binding LRP5/6 reduces the availability of cytoplasmic destruction complexes, thereby causing β-catenin accumulation. Membrane translocation of Axin1 may also mediate its Wnt-induced dephosphorylation and destabilization (Mao et al., 2001Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr III, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S.

Also, the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzyme tankyrase can mediate Axin1 degradation (Huang et al., 2009Huang S.M. Mishina Y.M. Liu S. Cheung A. Stegmeier F. Michaud G.A. Charlat O. Wiellette E. Zhang Y. Wiessner S. et al.Tankyrase inhibition stabilizes axin and antagonizes Wnt signalling.Nature. 2009; 461: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). By contrast, SUMOylation of Axin1 was reported to protect it from polyubiquitination and increase its stability (Kim et al., 2008Kim M.J. Chia I.V. Costantini F. SUMOylation target sites at the C terminus protect Axin from ubiquitination and confer protein stability.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3785-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An endocytic adaptor protein Dab2 prevents Axin1 membrane translocation, thereby leading to Axin1 stabilization (Jiang et al., 2009Jiang Y. Luo W. Howe P.H.

Dishevelled, which binds Axin1 directly, may disrupt the destruction complex upon Wnt activation (Liu et al., 2005Liu X. Rubin J.S. Kimmel A.R.

Biol. 2006; 72: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Frat/GBP family members may compete with Axin1 for GSK3 binding, thus disrupting the destruction complex (van Amerongen and Berns, 2005van Amerongen R. Berns A.

CKI and GSK3 can phosphorylate Axin1 and APC, enhancing their binding affinity for GSK3 and β-catenin. Wnt stimulation results in dephosphorylation of both Axin1 and APC. The catalytic subunits of the phosphatases PP1 and PP2A directly bind and dephosphorylate Axin1, promoting the disassembly of the destruction complex (Luo et al., 2007Luo W. Peterson A.

In vitro phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3 is inhibited by PPPSPxS motif peptides or by phosphorylated LRP6 cytoplasmic domain (Cselenyi et al., 2008Cselenyi C.S. Jernigan K.K. Tahinci E.

In addition, suppression of GSK3 kinase activity by protein kinase B (PKB) directly or through Dishevelled may mediate Wnt signal transduction (Desbois-Mouthon et al., 2001Desbois-Mouthon C.

Cell. 2008; 32: 652-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Taelman et al. propose that sequestration of GSK3 from the cytosol into multivesicular bodies inhibits GSK3 activity during Wnt signal transduction (Taelman et al., 2010Taelman V.F. Dobrowolski R. Plouhinec J.L. Fuentealba L.C. Vorwald P.P. Gumper I. Sabatini D.D. De Robertis E.M.

Roberts et al. suggest that disassembly of the destruction complex by APC through transferring phosphorylated β-catenin to the E3 ligase recycles the destruction complex for renewed β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation (Roberts et al., 2011Roberts D.M. Pronobis M.I. Poulton J.S. Waldmann J.D. Stephenson E.M. Hanna S. Peifer M. Deconstructing the ßcatenin destruction complex: mechanistic roles for the tumor suppressor APC in regulating Wnt signaling.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 1845-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, all previously proposed models (MacDonald et al., 2009MacDonald B.T. Tamai K. He X. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling: components, mechanisms, and diseases.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 9-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar) either assume a physical dissociation of the β-catenin destruction complex or propose an interference with β-catenin phosphorylation, leading to stabilization of β-catenin. All studies cited above, however, utilize overexpression strategies. Studies on the endogenous complex are hampered by the fact that Axin1 is expressed at vanishingly low levels, whereas APC, CK1, and GSK3, as well as β-catenin, occur abundantly outside of the destruction complex. Here, we study the endogenous destruction complex during Wnt signaling. HEK293T cells carry an intact Wnt signaling cascade. We previously generated high-affinity immunoprecipitating (IP)/western blotting monoclonal antibodies against Axin1 (Ng et al., 2009Ng S.S. Mahmoudi T. Danenberg E. Bejaoui I. de Lau W. Korswagen H.C. Schutte M. Clevers H. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling does not activate the wnt cascade.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35308-35313Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Pooled HEK293T cells from two 15 cm culture dishes allow visualization of endogenous Axin1 in a single lane by western blotting after immunoprecipitation (Ng et al., 2009Ng S.S. Mahmoudi T. Danenberg E. Bejaoui I. de Lau W. Korswagen H.C. Schutte M. Clevers H. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling does not activate the wnt cascade.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35308-35313Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This strategy allowed us to probe the composition of the destruction complex in Wnt-active versus nonactive HEK293T cells. Axin1 protein is degraded upon Wnt stimulation (Jiang et al., 2009Jiang Y. Luo W. Howe P.H.

Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). We stimulated HEK293T cells with Wnt3A-conditioned medium or control medium and monitored Axin1 protein and cytosolic β-catenin by western blot analysis (Figure S1A available online and Figure 1A ). Of note, the overwhelming amount of β-catenin resides in the membrane-bound E-cadherin complex, a highly stable pool that is irrelevant to Wnt signaling (van de Wetering et al., 2001van de Wetering M. Barker N. Harkes I.C. van der Heyden M. Dijk N.J. Hollestelle A. Klijn J.G. Clevers H. Schutte M. Mutant E-cadherin breast cancer cells do not display constitutive Wnt signaling.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 278-284PubMed Google Scholar). To increase detection sensitivity, we performed Axin1 immunoprecipitation on whole-cell lysates prior to western blot analysis (Figures 1B and 1C). Though cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin was detectable as early as 30 min following Wnt treatment (Figure 1A), we first observed a significant decrease in endogenous Axin1 protein at 4 hr post-Wnt stimulation (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1A), implying that degradation of Axin1 protein is not causal to the initial activation of the Wnt pathway.Figure 1Wnt-Induced Stabilization of β-Catenin Occurs prior to and Independently of Axin1 DegradationShow full captionHEK293T cells were stimulated with Wnt according to the indicated time points.(A) Cytosolic β-catenin protein levels begin to accumulate 30 min after Wnt stimulation, peaking at ∼2 hr.

Significant mRNA increases were detected from 0.5–2 hr post-Wnt stimulation (Figure 1D), when Axin1 protein levels were still unchanged. We then asked how the interaction between Axin1 and other components of the Wnt cascade is influenced by Wnt stimulation. We immunoprecipitated the Axin1 complex from HEK293T cells before and during Wnt treatment, followed by western blotting (Figure 2A ). In the absence of Wnt, Axin1 interacted with GSK3 (last panel) and APC (second panel), but not LRP6 (fourth panel). Phosphorylated LRP6 was only detected in the Axin1 complex after Wnt stimulation (third panel) (Mao et al., 2001Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr III, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D.

This observation was inconsistent with models in which dissociation of the destruction complex or modulation of Axin1 binding to GSK3β or APC mediate functional inactivation of the destruction complex. β-catenin coimmunoprecipitating with Axin1 was hardly detectable in the absence of Wnt stimulation, highlighting the dynamic nature of the β-catenin/Axin1 interaction (Figure 2, eighth panel). Surprisingly, we found a significant Wnt-induced increase in β-catenin immunoprecipitating with Axin1. We further analyzed this β-catenin pool using antibodies that specifically recognize P-Ser45 β-catenin or P-Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 β-catenin (Figure 2, sixth and seventh panel). Counter to prediction, we found an increase in phosphorylated β-catenin in the Wnt-stimulated Axin1 complex (Figure S2A ). This finding was consistent with a previous report noting phosphorylated β-catenin in high-molecular-weight complexes, whereas non-phospho-β-catenin accumulated in a monomeric form upon Wnt signaling (Maher et al., 2010Maher M.T. Mo R. Flozak A.S. Peled O.N. Gottardi C.J.

Thus, the critical kinases CK1 and GSK3β remain present and active within the destruction complex upon Wnt signaling. We also combined Axin1 immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry (MS) to obtain a global picture of the Axin1 complex in HEK293T. Consistent with our IP results, we readily detected the core components of the destruction complex (APC, GSK3β, CK1, and β-catenin) in both Wnt-inactive and -activated cells (Table S1). Quantitative MS using a label-free approach with extracted ion chromatograms further confirmed a significant increase of β-catenin detected within the Axin complex after Wnt stimulation. Other components (e.g., APC, GSK3β, and CK1) remained unchanged (Figures S2C, S2D, and Table S2). Similar observations were reported recently (Hilger and Mann, 2012Hilger M. Mann M.

https://openalex.org/W2104014368,"Cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence are widely accepted as the major mechanisms by which p53 inhibits tumor formation. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether they are the rate-limiting steps in tumor suppression. Here, we have generated mice bearing lysine to arginine mutations at one (p53(K117R)) or three (p53(3KR); K117R+K161R+K162R) of p53 acetylation sites. Although p53(K117R/K117R) cells are competent for p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest and senescence, but not apoptosis, all three of these processes are ablated in p53(3KR/3KR) cells. Surprisingly, unlike p53 null mice, which rapidly succumb to spontaneous thymic lymphomas, early-onset tumor formation does not occur in either p53(K117R/K117R) or p53(3KR/3KR) animals. Notably, p53(3KR) retains the ability to regulate energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species production. These findings underscore the crucial role of acetylation in differentially modulating p53 responses and suggest that unconventional activities of p53, such as metabolic regulation and antioxidant function, are critical for suppression of early-onset spontaneous tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2055929468,"The H19 large intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) is one of the most highly abundant and conserved transcripts in mammalian development, being expressed in both embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lineages, yet its physiological function is unknown. Here we show that miR-675, a microRNA (miRNA) embedded in H19's first exon, is expressed exclusively in the placenta from the gestational time point when placental growth normally ceases, and placentas that lack H19 continue to grow. Overexpression of miR-675 in a range of embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lines results in their reduced proliferation; targets of the miRNA are upregulated in the H19 null placenta, including the growth-promoting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r) gene. Moreover, the excision of miR-675 from H19 is dynamically regulated by the stress-response RNA-binding protein HuR. These results suggest that H19's main physiological role is in limiting growth of the placenta before birth, by regulated processing of miR-675. The controlled release of miR-675 from H19 may also allow rapid inhibition of cell proliferation in response to cellular stress or oncogenic signals."
https://openalex.org/W1970831058,"Chromatin loops juxtapose distal enhancers with active promoters, but their molecular architecture and relationship with transcription remain unclear. In erythroid cells, the locus control region (LCR) and β-globin promoter form a chromatin loop that requires transcription factor GATA1 and the associated molecule Ldb1. We employed artificial zinc fingers (ZF) to tether Ldb1 to the β-globin promoter in GATA1 null erythroblasts, in which the β-globin locus is relaxed and inactive. Remarkably, targeting Ldb1 or only its self-association domain to the β-globin promoter substantially activated β-globin transcription in the absence of GATA1. Promoter-tethered Ldb1 interacted with endogenous Ldb1 complexes at the LCR to form a chromatin loop, causing recruitment and phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. ZF-Ldb1 proteins were inactive at alleles lacking the LCR, demonstrating that their activities depend on long-range interactions. Our findings establish Ldb1 as a critical effector of GATA1-mediated loop formation and indicate that chromatin looping causally underlies gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2139115320,"Argonaute proteins lie at the heart of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), wherein they use small RNA guides to recognize targets. Initial insight into the architecture of Argonautes came from studies of prokaryotic proteins, revealing a crescent-shaped base made up of the amino-terminal, PAZ, middle, and PIWI domains. The recently reported crystal structure of human Argonaute-2 (hAgo2), the ""slicer"" in RNA interference, in complex with a mixed population of RNAs derived from insect cells provides insight into the architecture of a eukaryotic Argonaute protein with defined biochemical and biological functions. Here, we report the structure of human Ago2 bound to a physiologically relevant microRNA, microRNA-20a, at 2.2 Å resolution. The miRNA is anchored at both ends by the Mid and PAZ domains and makes several kinks and turns along the binding groove. Interestingly, miRNA binding confers remarkable stability on hAgo2, locking this otherwise flexible enzyme into a stable conformation."

However, clinical applications must consider the risk of tumor formation by iPSCs and the inability of iNCs to self-renew in culture. Here we report the generation of induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) from mouse and human fibroblasts by direct reprogramming with a single factor, Sox2. iNSCs express NSC markers and resemble wild-type NSCs in their morphology, self-renewal, ability to form neurospheres, and gene expression profiles. Cloned iNSCs differentiate into several types of mature neurons, as well as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, indicating multipotency. Implanted iNSCs can survive and integrate in mouse brains and, unlike iPSC-derived NSCs, do not generate tumors. Thus, self-renewable and multipotent iNSCs without tumorigenic potential can be generated directly from fibroblasts by reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2052985891,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is linked to neuron death in the hippocampus. Now David Henshall and colleagues show that miR-134 is upregulated in humans with TLE and in an experimental epilepsy model in mice. Decreasing miR-134 before induction of epilepsy in mice reduces neuron death and the generation of spontaneous seizures. Temporal lobe epilepsy is a common, chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional expression of protein-coding mRNAs, which may have key roles in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. In experimental models of prolonged, injurious seizures (status epilepticus) and in human epilepsy, we found upregulation of miR-134, a brain-specific, activity-regulated miRNA that has been implicated in the control of dendritic spine morphology. Silencing of miR-134 expression in vivo using antagomirs reduced hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neuron dendrite spine density by 21% and rendered mice refractory to seizures and hippocampal injury caused by status epilepticus. Depletion of miR-134 after status epilepticus in mice reduced the later occurrence of spontaneous seizures by over 90% and mitigated the attendant pathological features of temporal lobe epilepsy. Thus, silencing miR-134 exerts prolonged seizure-suppressant and neuroprotective actions; determining whether these are anticonvulsant effects or are truly antiepileptogenic effects requires additional experimentation."
https://openalex.org/W2093514926,"Cortical synapses have structural, molecular and functional heterogeneity; our knowledge regarding the relationship between their ultrastructural and functional parameters is still fragmented. Here we asked how the neurotransmitter release probability and presynaptic [Ca(2+)] transients relate to the ultrastructure of rat hippocampal glutamatergic axon terminals. Two-photon Ca(2+) imaging-derived optical quantal analysis and correlated electron microscopic reconstructions revealed a tight correlation between the release probability and the active-zone area. Peak amplitude of [Ca(2+)] transients in single boutons also positively correlated with the active-zone area. Freeze-fracture immunogold labeling revealed that the voltage-gated calcium channel subunit Cav2.1 and the presynaptic protein Rim1/2 are confined to the active zone and their numbers scale linearly with the active-zone area. Gold particles labeling Cav2.1 were nonrandomly distributed in the active zones. Our results demonstrate that the numbers of several active-zone proteins, including presynaptic calcium channels, as well as the number of docked vesicles and the release probability, scale linearly with the active-zone area."

https://openalex.org/W2094325380,"Many lipid-tethered proteins and glycolipids exist as monomers and nanoclusters on the surface of living cells. The spatial distribution and dynamics of formation and breakup of nanoclusters does not reflect thermal and chemical equilibrium and is controlled by active remodeling of the underlying cortical actin. We propose a model for nanoclustering based on active hydrodynamics, wherein cell surface molecules bound to dynamic actin are actively driven to form transient clusters. This consistently explains all of our experimental observations. Using FCS and TIRF microscopy, we provide evidence for the existence of short, dynamic, polymerizing actin filaments at the cortex, a key assumption of the theoretical framework. Our theory predicts that lipid-anchored proteins that interact with dynamic actin must exhibit anomalous concentration fluctuations, and a cell membrane protein capable of binding directly to actin can form nanoclusters. These we confirm experimentally, providing an active mechanism for molecular organization and its spatiotemporal regulation on the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2053453206,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in human cancers. It has been reported that lncRNA highly up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC) is dramatically up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) contributes importantly to the development of HCC. However, the function of HULC in HCC mediated by HBx remains unclear. Here, we report that HULC is involved in HBx-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis. We found that the expression levels of HULC were positively correlated with those of HBx in clinical HCC tissues. Moreover, we revealed that HBx up-regulated HULC in human immortalized normal liver L-O2 cells and hepatoma HepG2 cells. Luciferase reporter gene assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that HBx activated the HULC promoter via cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. We further demonstrated that HULC promoted cell proliferation by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, colony formation assay, and tumorigenicity assay. Next, we hypothesized that HULC might function through regulating a tumor suppressor gene p18 located near HULC in the same chromosome. We found that the mRNA levels of p18 were inversely correlated with those of HULC in the above clinical HCC specimens. Then, we validated that HULC down-regulated p18, which was involved in the HULC-enhanced cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we observed that knockdown of HULC could abolish the HBx-enhanced cell proliferation through up-regulating p18. Thus, we conclude that the up-regulated HULC by HBx promotes proliferation of hepatoma cells through suppressing p18. This finding provides new insight into the roles of lncRNAs in HBx-related hepatocarcinogenesis."

They identify two loci that are newly associated with migraine without aura. Migraine without aura is the most common form of migraine, characterized by recurrent disabling headache and associated autonomic symptoms. To identify common genetic variants associated with this migraine type, we analyzed genome-wide association data of 2,326 clinic-based German and Dutch individuals with migraine without aura and 4,580 population-matched controls. We selected SNPs from 12 loci with 2 or more SNPs associated with P values of <1 × 10−5 for replication testing in 2,508 individuals with migraine without aura and 2,652 controls. SNPs at two of these loci showed convincing replication: at 1q22 (in MEF2D; replication P = 4.9 × 10−4; combined P = 7.06 × 10−11) and at 3p24 (near TGFBR2; replication P = 1.0 × 10−4; combined P = 1.17 × 10−9). In addition, SNPs at the PHACTR1 and ASTN2 loci showed suggestive evidence of replication (P = 0.01; combined P = 3.20 × 10−8 and P = 0.02; combined P = 3.86 × 10−8, respectively). We also replicated associations at two previously reported migraine loci in or near TRPM8 and LRP1. This study identifies the first susceptibility loci for migraine without aura, thereby expanding our knowledge of this debilitating neurological disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1998984090,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited DNA repair deficiency syndrome. FA patients undergo progressive bone marrow failure (BMF) during childhood, which frequently requires allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The pathogenesis of this BMF has been elusive to date. Here we found that FA patients exhibit a profound defect in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that is present before the onset of clinical BMF. In response to replicative stress and unresolved DNA damage, p53 is hyperactivated in FA cells and triggers a late p21(Cdkn1a)-dependent G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest. Knockdown of p53 rescued the HSPC defects observed in several in vitro and in vivo models, including human FA or FA-like cells. Taken together, our results identify an exacerbated p53/p21 ""physiological"" response to cellular stress and DNA damage accumulation as a central mechanism for progressive HSPC elimination in FA patients, and have implications for clinical care."

https://openalex.org/W2160766576,"Wnt signaling plays critical roles in development of various organs and pathogenesis of many diseases, and augmented Wnt signaling has recently been implicated in mammalian aging and aging-related phenotypes. We here report that complement C1q activates canonical Wnt signaling and promotes aging-associated decline in tissue regeneration. Serum C1q concentration is increased with aging, and Wnt signaling activity is augmented during aging in the serum and in multiple tissues of wild-type mice, but not in those of C1qa-deficient mice. C1q activates canonical Wnt signaling by binding to Frizzled receptors and subsequently inducing C1s-dependent cleavage of the ectodomain of Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6. Skeletal muscle regeneration in young mice is inhibited by exogenous C1q treatment, whereas aging-associated impairment of muscle regeneration is restored by C1s inhibition or C1qa gene disruption. Our findings therefore suggest the unexpected role of complement C1q in Wnt signal transduction and modulation of mammalian aging."

Their novel products include 20-hydroxyvitamin D(3) [20(OH)D3], 22(OH)D3, 20,23(OH)(2)D3, 20,22(OH)(2)D3, 1,20(OH)(2)D3, 1,20,23(OH)(3)D3, and 17,20,23(OH)(3)D3 and were produced by placenta, adrenal glands, and epidermal keratinocytes. We detected the predominant metabolite [20(OH)D3] in human serum with a relative concentration ∼20 times lower than 25(OH)D3. Use of inhibitors and studies performed with isolated mitochondria and purified enzymes demonstrated involvement of the steroidogenic enzyme cytochrome P450scc (CYP11A1) as well as CYP27B1 (1α-hydroxylase). In placenta and adrenal glands with high CYP11A1 expression, the predominant pathway was D3 → 20(OH)D3 → 20,23(OH)(2)D3 → 17,20,23(OH)(3)D3 with further 1α-hydroxylation, and minor pathways were D3 → 25(OH)D3 → 1,25(OH)(2)D3 and D3 → 22(OH)D3 → 20,22(OH)(2)D3. In epidermal keratinocytes, we observed higher proportions of 22(OH)D3 and 20,22(OH)(2)D3. We also detected endogenous production of 20(OH)D3, 22(OH) D3, 20,23(OH)(2)D3, 20,22(OH)(2)D3, and 17,20,23(OH)(3)D3 by immortalized human keratinocytes. Thus, we provide in vivo evidence for novel pathways of D3 metabolism initiated by CYP11A1, with the product profile showing organ/cell type specificity and being modified by CYP27B1 activity. These findings define the pathway intermediates as natural products/endogenous bioregulators and break the current dogma that vitamin D is solely activated through the sequence D3 → 25(OH)D3 → 1,25(OH)(2)D3."
https://openalex.org/W2063432148,"By digital profiling of residual breast tumors after neoadjuvant therapy, the authors identify gene expression patterns that correspond with a higher risk of metastasis and recurrence. Activation of the Ras-ERK pathway through loss of DUSP4 confers therapy resistance that can be overcome by combined treatment with MEK inhibitors. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) induces a pathological complete response (pCR) in ∼30% of patients with breast cancer. However, many patients have residual cancer after chemotherapy, which correlates with a higher risk of metastatic recurrence and poorer outcome than those who achieve a pCR. We hypothesized that molecular profiling of tumors after NAC would identify genes associated with drug resistance. Digital transcript counting was used to profile surgically resected breast cancers after NAC. Low concentrations of dual specificity protein phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), an ERK phosphatase, correlated with high post-NAC tumor cell proliferation and with basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) status. BLBC had higher DUSP4 promoter methylation and gene expression patterns of Ras-ERK pathway activation relative to other breast cancer subtypes. DUSP4 overexpression increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, whereas DUSP4 depletion dampened the response to chemotherapy. Reduced DUSP4 expression in primary tumors after NAC was associated with treatment-refractory high Ki-67 scores and shorter recurrence-free survival. Finally, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) synergized with docetaxel treatment in BLBC xenografts. Thus, DUSP4 downregulation activates the Ras-ERK pathway in BLBC, resulting in an attenuated response to anti-cancer chemotherapy."

Previous research suggests that chunking involves two processes: concatenation, aimed at the formation of motor-motor associations between elements or sets of elements, and segmentation, aimed at the parsing of multiple contiguous elements into shorter action sets. We used fMRI to measure the trial-wise recruitment of brain regions associated with these chunking processes as healthy subjects performed a cued-sequence production task. A dynamic network analysis identified chunking structure for a set of motor sequences acquired during fMRI and collected over 3 days of training. Activity in the bilateral sensorimotor putamen positively correlated with chunk concatenation, whereas a left-hemisphere frontoparietal network was correlated with chunk segmentation. Across subjects, there was an aggregate increase in chunk strength (concatenation) with training, suggesting that subcortical circuits play a direct role in the creation of fluid transitions across chunks."
https://openalex.org/W2127002994,"It is currently unclear whether tissue changes surrounding multifocal epithelial tumors are a cause or consequence of cancer. Here, we provide evidence that loss of mesenchymal Notch/CSL signaling causes tissue alterations, including stromal atrophy and inflammation, which precede and are potent triggers for epithelial tumors. Mice carrying a mesenchymal-specific deletion of CSL/RBP-Jκ, a key Notch effector, exhibit spontaneous multifocal keratinocyte tumors that develop after dermal atrophy and inflammation. CSL-deficient dermal fibroblasts promote increased tumor cell proliferation through upregulation of c-Jun and c-Fos expression and consequently higher levels of diffusible growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and matrix-remodeling enzymes. In human skin samples, stromal fields adjacent to multifocal premalignant actinic keratosis lesions exhibit decreased Notch/CSL signaling and associated molecular changes.

https://openalex.org/W2141756194,"Thrombospondin (Thbs) proteins are induced in sites of tissue damage or active remodeling. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is also prominently induced with disease where it regulates protein production and resolution of misfolded proteins. Here we describe a function for Thbs as ER-resident effectors of an adaptive ER stress response. Thbs4 cardiac-specific transgenic mice were protected from myocardial injury, whereas Thbs4(-/-) mice were sensitized to cardiac maladaptation. Thbs induction produced a unique profile of adaptive ER stress response factors and expansion of the ER and downstream vesicles. Thbs bind the ER lumenal domain of activating transcription factor 6α (Atf6α) to promote its nuclear shuttling. Thbs4(-/-) mice showed blunted activation of Atf6α and other ER stress-response factors with injury, and Thbs4-mediated protection was lost upon Atf6α deletion. Hence, Thbs can function inside the cell during disease remodeling to augment ER function and protect through a mechanism involving regulation of Atf6α."
https://openalex.org/W2081077839,"Ron Wevers, Saskia Wortmann and colleagues show that mutations in SERAC1 cause a recessive syndrome characterized by deafness, encephalopathy, progressive spasticity and dystonia. Their findings suggest a role for SERAC1 in phosphatidylglycerol remodeling and intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Using exome sequencing, we identify SERAC1 mutations as the cause of MEGDEL syndrome, a recessive disorder of dystonia and deafness with Leigh-like syndrome, impaired oxidative phosphorylation and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. We localized SERAC1 at the interface between the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum in the mitochondria-associated membrane fraction that is essential for phospholipid exchange. A phospholipid analysis in patient fibroblasts showed elevated concentrations of phosphatidylglycerol-34:1 (where the species nomenclature denotes the number of carbon atoms in the two acyl chains:number of double bonds in the two acyl groups) and decreased concentrations of phosphatidylglycerol-36:1 species, resulting in an altered cardiolipin subspecies composition. We also detected low concentrations of bis(monoacyl-glycerol)-phosphate, leading to the accumulation of free cholesterol, as shown by abnormal filipin staining. Complementation of patient fibroblasts with wild-type human SERAC1 by lentiviral infection led to a decrease and partial normalization of the mean ratio of phosphatidylglycerol-34:1 to phosphatidylglycerol-36:1. Our data identify SERAC1 as a key player in the phosphatidylglycerol remodeling that is essential for both mitochondrial function and intracellular cholesterol trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2089471687,"Although the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has improved substantially in the past three decades, more than half of all patients develop disease that is refractory to intensive chemotherapy. Functional genomics approaches offer a means to discover specific molecules mediating the aberrant growth and survival of cancer cells. Thus, using a loss-of-function RNA interference genomic screen, we identified the aberrant expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a crucial element in AML pathogenesis. We found HGF expression leading to autocrine activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase, MET, in nearly half of the AML cell lines and clinical samples we studied. Genetic depletion of HGF or MET potently inhibited the growth and survival of HGF-expressing AML cells. However, leukemic cells treated with the specific MET kinase inhibitor crizotinib developed resistance resulting from compensatory upregulation of HGF expression, leading to the restoration of MET signaling. In cases of AML where MET is coactivated with other tyrosine kinases, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), concomitant inhibition of FGFR1 and MET blocked this compensatory HGF upregulation, resulting in sustained logarithmic cell killing both in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Our results show a widespread dependence of AML cells on autocrine activation of MET, as well as the key role of compensatory upregulation of HGF expression in maintaining leukemogenic signaling by this receptor. We anticipate that these findings will lead to the design of additional strategies to block adaptive cellular responses that drive compensatory ligand expression as an essential component of the targeted inhibition of oncogenic receptors in human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4236794815,"Hypothalamic neurons expressing Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) are critical for initiating food intake, but druggable biochemical pathways that control this response remain elusive. Thus, genetic ablation of insulin or leptin signaling in AgRP neurons is predicted to reduce satiety but fails to do so. FoxO1 is a shared mediator of both pathways, and its inhibition is required to induce satiety. Accordingly, FoxO1 ablation in AgRP neurons of mice results in reduced food intake, leanness, improved glucose homeostasis, and increased sensitivity to insulin and leptin. Expression profiling of flow-sorted FoxO1-deficient AgRP neurons identifies G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr17 as a FoxO1 target whose expression is regulated by nutritional status. Intracerebroventricular injection of Gpr17 agonists induces food intake, whereas Gpr17 antagonist cangrelor curtails it. These effects are absent in Agrp-Foxo1 knockouts, suggesting that pharmacological modulation of this pathway has therapeutic potential to treat obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1981560232,"Neuronal discharges in the primate temporal lobe, but not in the striate and extrastriate cortex, reliably reflect stimulus awareness. However, it is not clear whether visual consciousness should be uniquely localized in the temporal association cortex. Here we used binocular flash suppression to investigate whether visual awareness is also explicitly reflected in feature-selective neural activity of the macaque lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), a cortical area reciprocally connected to the temporal lobe. We show that neuronal discharges in the majority of single units and recording sites in the LPFC follow the phenomenal perception of a preferred stimulus. Furthermore, visual awareness is reliably reflected in the power modulation of high-frequency (>50 Hz) local field potentials in sites where spiking activity is found to be perceptually modulated. Our results suggest that the activity of neuronal populations in at least two association cortical areas represents the content of conscious visual perception."

S phase checkpoint deficiency causes reversal of stalled replication forks Dna2 prevents fork reversal S phase checkpoint targets Dna2 to prevent fork reversal Dna2 nuclease activity is essential for stabilizing stalled replication forks The accurate completion of chromosomal DNA replication is essential to maintain genomic integrity. During DNA synthesis the progression of replication forks is frequently challenged and arrested by DNA lesions, resulting either from endogenous or exogenous DNA damage, and by intrinsic pause sites on chromosomes. Such intrinsic replication fork barriers (RFBs) are associated with highly transcribed regions, chromosome architecture and DNA secondary structure (Cha and Kleckner, 2002Cha R.S. Kleckner N. ATR homolog Mec1 promotes fork progression, thus averting breaks in replication slow zones.Science. 2002; 297: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, Mirkin and Mirkin, 2007Mirkin E.V.

Maintenance of fork integrity at damaged DNA and natural pause sites.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 900-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is critical to maintain an arrested replication fork in an appropriate configuration such that it can efficiently resume DNA synthesis once the impediment is resolved. We define this as a “stalled” replication fork. Failure to maintain an arrested fork in a stalled configuration results in fork “collapse,” a situation where resumption is impaired and pathways such as homologous recombination (HR) must act to restart replication. The intra-S phase checkpoint plays essential roles both in the stable stalling of arrested replication forks and in preventing fork reversal. Fork reversal is thought to be one form of fork collapse and results from the annealing of the two nascent strands behind the fork to generate pathological “chicken foot” structures. These resemble Holliday junctions and are thus prone to cleavage (Lambert et al., 2005Lambert S. Watson A. Sheedy D.M. Martin B. Carr A.M.

In budding yeast, when cells deficient in the intra-S phase checkpoint (i.e., rad53chk2 mutants) are treated with hydroxyurea (HU), the majority of forks collapse. Some 8.3%–11.2% of these events manifest as reversed forks (Sogo et al., 2002Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M.

Mechanistically, it remains unclear how the intra-S phase checkpoint stably stalls arrested replication forks, both at the level of maintaining the replication proteins at the site of DNA incorporation and in preventing inappropriate DNA transactions. We are specifically interested to understand how the intra-S phase checkpoint prevents fork reversal. The key questions include: what is the downstream target(s), what is the relevant biochemical function, and how is this regulated (Figure 1A )? Here we report the identification of fission yeast Dna2, an endonuclease known to function at replication forks to process Okazaki fragments, as a target of Cds1Chk2 and demonstrate that Dna2 nuclease activity is directly responsible for preventing stalled replication forks from collapsing through fork reversal. Cds1Chk2 phosphorylates Dna2-S220 and this phosphorylation is required both in vivo and in vitro for Dna2 association with chromatin-containing stalled replication forks. Consistent with this a dna2S220A strain is sensitive to HU treatment, epistasis analysis demonstrates that Cds1Chk2 and Dna2 operate in the same pathway, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Dna2 can efficiently cleave regressed leading or lagging strands—obligate intermediates of fork reversal—in the context of model replication forks. We conclude that Rad3ATR-Cds1Chk2-mediated intra-S phase checkpoint targets Dna2 to prevent arrested replication forks from reversing, thus contributing to the maintenance of genome integrity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, fork reversal has been demonstrated in response to fork arrest in intra-S phase checkpoint deficient cells. To establish whether this is also the case for S. pombe, wild-type (WT) and checkpoint defective (Tanaka and Russell, 2001Tanaka K. Russell P. Mrc1 channels the DNA replication arrest signal to checkpoint kinase Cds1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) cds1− cells were treated with HU, and DNA was prepared for analysis by electron microscopy (Liberi et al., 2006Liberi G. Cotta-Ramusino C. Lopes M. Sogo J. Conti C. Bensimon A. Foiani M. Methods to study replication fork collapse in budding yeast.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 442-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Sogo et al., 2002Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M.

Thoma F. Electron microscopy of chromatin.Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 142-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We observed that ∼8.1% of arrested forks were reversed in HU-treated cds1− cells, compared to ∼1.3% of reversed forks in HU-treated wild-type or untreated cds1− cells (Figure 1B). (Note that in S. cerevisiae, ∼1% fork reversal is observed in HU-treated WT cells or untreated rad53− cells (Sogo et al., 2002Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Fork reversal and ssDNA accumulation at stalled replication forks owing to checkpoint defects.Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar)). Therefore, this function of the intra-S phase checkpoint in maintaining fork integrity is conserved between the budding and fission yeasts, suggesting a similar function in higher eukaryotes. In contrast, lack of Chk1 (G2/M checkpoint kinase) did not increase the level of fork reversal (Figure 1B). We hypothesized that Cds1 directly phosphorylates one or more proteins to prevent fork reversal (“protein X,” Figure 1A). To identify such targets we used two approaches: For the first approach we used mass spectroscopy to screen for proteins that were present in chromatin fractions and phosphorylated in a Cds1-dependent manner when replication forks were stalled by the presence of HU. For the second approach we used in vitro DNA affinity chromatography against an artificial replication fork structure to enrich proteins present in chromatin extracts prepared from HU treated cds1+ cells, but which was missing from equivalent purifications from cds1− cells. One protein, Dna2, presented in both screens. The first screen showed that Dna2 was phosphorylated on S220 and S135 only when prepared from HU treated cds1+ cells (Figure S1A available online). S220-phosphorylated peptide abundance was ∼8-fold more than the S135-phosphorylated peptide. Cds1-mediated phosphorylation of Dna2-S220 was later confirmed in vitro by using purified Cds1 and Dna2 proteins (see Figure 4B and Figure S7). The second screen also identified Dna2, this time as a model fork binding protein that was present only in the chromatin extracts derived from HU-arrested cds1+ cells but not in the chromatin extracts derived from HU-arrested cds1− cells (Figure S1B). We later observed that Dna2 phosphorylation by Cds1 is necessary for Dna2 association with chromatin in HU treated cells (see Figure 3). This indicates we did not observe Dna2 binding to model forks when chromatin was prepared from cds1− cells because it was not present in the chromatin preparation. The first step of fork reversal must be the dissociation of a nascent strand (leading or lagging) from its template DNA strand at the arrested fork (Figure 1A). Subsequent pairing of the dissociated nascent strand with the second nascent strand then results in fork reversal, creating a chicken foot structure. Fork reversal can thus be prevented if the initial nascent strand is cleaved by a nuclease following its dissociation. Thus, as shown in Figure 1A, cleavage of the initial flap-like structure will prevent fork reversal. Dna2, along with Fen1, is located at replication forks, and both possess flap endonuclease activity for processing Okazaki fragments in vivo (Ayyagari et al., 2003Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A.

Chem. 2009; 284: 8283-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the role of Dna2 and Fen1 in preventing fork reversal. In a Fen1-deficient strain (rad2 in S. pombe; not essential for growth [Murray et al., 1994Murray J.M. Tavassoli M. al-Harithy R. Sheldrick K.S. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. Watts F.Z. Structural and functional conservation of the human homolog of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe rad2 gene, which is required for chromosome segregation and recovery from DNA damage.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4878-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar]) treated with HU, the rate of fork reversal remained at the basal level (∼1.2%), suggesting that Fen1 does not play an important role in preventing fork reversal. dna2 is an essential gene (Budd et al., 1995Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. DNA2 encodes a DNA helicase essential for replication of eukaryotic chromosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Kang et al., 2000Kang H.Y. Choi E. Bae S.H. Lee K.H. Gim B.S. Kim H.D. Park C. MacNeill S.A. Seo Y.S. Genetic analyses of Schizosaccharomyces pombe dna2(+) reveal that dna2 plays an essential role in Okazaki fragment metabolism.Genetics. 2000; 155: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so we constructed a diploid strain with one dna2 gene replaced with ura4. After sporulation of the diploid, the mixed population of dna2− and dna2+ haploid spores were incubated in medium lacking uracil, allowing only dna2− spores to germinate. Germinating dna2− spores started to synthesize DNA at ∼6 hr after incubation, resulting in a significant population of cells containing a 2C DNA at ∼18 hr (Figure S2A ). These exhibited an elongated cell phenotype, a characteristic of cell-division-cycle mutants (Figure S2B). dna2+ (ura4−) spores could not synthesize DNA in medium lacking uracil and thus remained with a 1C DNA content. To analyze the structure of arrested forks in Dna2-defective cells, spores were first germinated for 6 hr and then HU or MMS were added to cultures for 4–9 hr before harvesting. Approximately 1% of forks reversed in untreated germinated dna2− spores, similar to levels in either HU- or MMS-treated germinated dna2+ spores or untreated dna2+ germinated spores. In contrast, ∼8.7% and ∼8.1% of replication forks reversed to form chicken foot structures in the germinated dna2− spores treated with either HU or MMS for 6 hr (Figure 1B). Similar rates of fork reversal (∼8%) were seen with increasing time of HU treatment (4, 6, and 9 hr; Figure S3A ). These data indicate that Dna2 is required for preventing fork reversal in otherwise S phase checkpoint-proficient cells. Electron micrographs of reversed forks obtained from germinated dna2− spores are shown in Figures 1C–1G (HU-stalled forks) and Figures 1H–1K (MMS-stalled forks). The arrow in Figures 1C–1E shows a regressed single-strand DNA (ssDNA) chain, probably the intermediate in the process leading to reversed forks. The two empty triangles in Figure 1H indicate the broken ends of one reversed ssDNA. Consistent with observation from S. cerevisiae rad53− cells (Sogo et al., 2002Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Fork reversal and ssDNA accumulation at stalled replication forks owing to checkpoint defects.Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), ssDNA regions of HU-stalled forks from both cds1− and dna2− cells were also detected (Figures 1L and 1M): ∼40% of forks contained a ssDNA region on one side with an average length of 400–500 nucleotides (nt). Approximately 20% of forks contained ∼250 nt ssDNA on both sides. The remaining forks show undetectable, or at least very short, ssDNA regions. In contrast, the average length of ssDNA regions in HU-arrested forks from wild-type cells was ∼250 nt. The observed frequency of HU-arrested fork reversal was equivalent for both cds1− and dna2− cells (Figure 1B), consistent with Cds1 and Dna2 acting in the same biological pathway. To examine this, we used a temperature-sensitive (ts) dna2-L1097S mutant (Kang et al., 2000Kang H.Y. Choi E. Bae S.H. Lee K.H. Gim B.S. Kim H.D. Park C. MacNeill S.A. Seo Y.S. Genetic analyses of Schizosaccharomyces pombe dna2(+) reveal that dna2 plays an essential role in Okazaki fragment metabolism.Genetics. 2000; 155: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HU-treated dna2ts cells grown at 26°C or 36°C exhibited ∼0.9% and ∼5.6% of reversed forks, respectively (Figure 2A ). Importantly, equal levels of fork reversal (∼8.4% versus 8.3%) were obtained when cds1− and cds1−-dna2ts double-mutant cells were treated with HU at the restrictive temperature of 36°C. We conclude that Cds1 and Dna2 likely act in the same pathway to prevent fork reversal. As an alternative method to examine fork reversal, we performed 2D gel analysis (Lopes et al., 2001Lopes M. Cotta-Ramusino C. Pellicioli A. Liberi G. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Newlon C.S. Foiani M. The DNA replication checkpoint response stabilizes stalled replication forks.Nature. 2001; 412: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), where a “X-spike” signal represents the reversed forks (Bell and Byers, 1983Bell L.

Holliday junctions accumulate in replication mutants via a RecA homolog-independent mechanism.Cell. 1997; 90: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The X-spike signal, which is present as expected in DNA from HU-treated wild-type cells (∼0.83%), was increased in dna2ts cells (∼1.8%) and further increased in cds1− cells (∼6.3%). Consistent with our epistasis analysis using electron microscopy (EM), the X-spike signal was similar for cds1− and cds1−-dna2ts double-mutant cells (∼6.3% versus ∼5.4%). Although the 2D-gel analysis can be argued to have a relatively lower accuracy for quantifying fork reversal when compared to EM analysis absolute values, the fact of wild-type < dna2ts < cds1− ∼cds1−-dna2ts in both assays is consistent with a single Cds1 and Dna2-dependent pathway. We propose that Dna2 is a downstream target of Cds1Chk2. However, Dna2 could indirectly influence Cds1Chk2 activity by functioning upstream. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined intra-S checkpoint activation by monitoring Cds1Chk2 phosphorylation at T11 following HU-treatment of germinated dna2− spores or dna2ts cells shifted to the restrictive temperature of 36°C (Tanaka and Russell, 2004Tanaka K. Russell P. Cds1 phosphorylation by Rad3-Rad26 kinase is mediated by forkhead-associated domain interaction with Mrc1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32079-32086Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As expected, Cds1Chk2 was phosphorylated after HU treatment of wild-type cells. In untreated dna2ts cells at 36°C, Cds1 was moderately phosphorylated (most likely due to unligated Okazaki fragments), and this became more prevalent following HU treatment (Figure 3A ). Importantly, for germinated dna2+ or dna2− spores treated with HU, Cds1 was equivalently phosphorylated at T11 (Figure 3A, see legend). These data indicate that the reversal of HU-arrested forks in dna2ts and dna2− cells results directly from loss of Dna2 activity, rather than indirectly through loss or reduction of the Cds1-dependent checkpoint. In unperturbed replication, Dna2 processes Okazaki fragments (Kang et al., 2000Kang H.Y. Choi E. Bae S.H. Lee K.H. Gim B.S. Kim H.D. Park C. MacNeill S.A. Seo Y.S. Genetic analyses of Schizosaccharomyces pombe dna2(+) reveal that dna2 plays an essential role in Okazaki fragment metabolism.Genetics. 2000; 155: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we propose that in response to replication arrest, it has a role in preventing fork reversal. In both instances, Dna2 would be expected to colocate with the replication fork. We therefore used Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to examine whether Dna2 and DNA polymerase α colocated in HU-arrested wild-type cells. Consistent with Dna2 being fork associated, the ARS3001 origin was enriched ∼4- to 5-fold by antibodies against Polα or Dna2 (Figure S4A ). We next examined the general chromatin association of Dna2 in cds1− and cds1+ cells, either in the presence or absence of HU treatment. In unperturbed cds1− and cds1+ cells in S phase, both the total amount and the chromatin association of Dna2 were equivalent (Figure 3B). However, following HU treatment Dna2 chromatin association was reduced ∼5-fold in cds1− cells when compared with cds1+ cells, whereas the total Dna2 amount remained similar (Figure 3C). Consistent with Cds1Chk2 being required to maintain Dna2 at arrested forks, ChIP analysis showed that, although Polα remained enriched at ARS3001 in HU-treated cds1− cells, Dna2 enrichment was significantly reduced (Figure S4B). The general fate of replication proteins when forks stall or collapse is unknown. To establish whether HU-induced chromosome dissociation in the absence of Cds1Chk2 activity is a common feature, we also examined Cdc45 and Sld5. Both resembled Polα and showed no changes in chromatin association. Thus, the majority of replication proteins likely remain associated with stalled forks, and Dna2 is an exception. We also determined that in dna2ts cells at 26°C or 36°C (Figure 3D) the three proteins remained chromatin associated during HU treatment. Dna2 was phosphorylated at S220 and S135 in vivo (Figure S1A). To establish whether Cds1 directly phosphorylates Dna2, overexpressed Cds1 was purified to apparent homogeneity from HU-treated S. pombe cells (Figure 4A ) and used to phosphorylate purified S. pombe Dna2 (Figure 4B). Mass spectroscopy determined that S220 was strongly phosphorylated (Figure S7). In addition, we observed T79 phosphorylation at ∼13-fold lower abundance, based on the levels of trypsin-digested phosphor-peptides. These in vitro data indicated that Cds1 directly phosphorylated Dna2-S220. Dna2-S135 phosphorylation, which was detected in vivo in three independent experiments, was not detected in two independent in vitro experiments. T79, S135, and S220 each lie within a Cds1Chk2-consensus motif (I/LxR/KxxS/T) (O'Neill et al., 2002O'Neill T. Giarratani L. Chen P. Iyer L. Lee C.H. Bobiak M. Kanai F. Zhou B.B. Chung J.H.

Determination of substrate specificity and putative substrates of Chk2 kinase.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We conclude that the Dna2-S220 is the major Cds1Chk2 phosphorylation site and that T79 and S135 are potential minor sites. Dna2 dissociates from chromatin in HU-arrested cds1− cells, but not in cds1+ cells, implicating Cds1Chk2-mediated phosphorylation in Dna2 association with HU-arrested replication forks. To establish a direct role of phosphorylation in chromatin association, we isolated chromatin from HU-arrested cds1− cells, which contains HU-arrested replication forks but is free from endogenous Dna2, and determined whether Dna2 could associate with this material when it was phosphorylated by Cds1Chk2 (Figure 4C). Mixing Dna2 with Cds1Chk2 in the absence of ATP was insufficient to drive association, whereas the addition of ATP resulted in Dna2 chromatin association. Thus, Cds1Chk2 did not promote Dna2 association with chromatin-containing stalled forks directly but provided this activity via phosphorylation (Figure 4C). To examine the role of Cds1Chk2-mediated Dna2 phosphorylation in vivo, we constructed five mutant strains (Figure 5A ): dna2T79A, dna2S135A, dna2S220A, dna2S220D, and dna2S220A,T79A,S135A. The dna2T79A and dna2S135A strains were not HU sensitive (data not shown) and were not explored further. The fact that dna2S220A cells grew with similar kinetics to dna2+ cells in medium without HU (Figure 5B) indicates that normal replicative functions are unaffected by the S220A mutation. dna2S220A cells were significantly more sensitive to HU than the dna2+ controls (Figures 5C and 5D), whereas the phosphomimic dna2S220D mutant was not HU sensitive (Figures 5A and 5C). Further mutation of T79A and S135A alongside S220A (dna2S220A,T79A,S135A) did not result in further HU sensitivity (data not shown). When the cds1− mutation was combined with the phosphomimic mutant, dna2S220D, the resulting cds1−-dna2S220D strain could apparently rescue the HU sensitivity of cds1− cells (Figure 5E). Considering that the Dna2S220D may not fully mimic the phosphorylation of Dna2 on S220 site, the actual rescuing extent from the phosphorylated Dna2 on S220 site may be higher than the observed value from the assay of the phosphomimic dna2S220D strain. This is consistent with the suggestion that Dna2 is a target of Cds1Chk2 during intra-S phase checkpoint activation and that Dna2-S220 phosphorylation plays a role in stabilizing stalled replication forks. It also indicates that Cds1Chk2 has other targets that are important for stabilizing stalled forks because the phosphomimic Dna2S220D did not completely rescue the HU sensitivity of cds1− cells. Cds1Chk2-dependent phosphorylation is required for in vitro Dna2 association with chromatin isolated from cds1− cells treated with HU (Figure 4C). To establish the dependence of Dna2 chromatin association on S220 phosphorylation in vivo, Dna2S220A associati"
https://openalex.org/W2044450732,"How neurons develop their morphology is an important question in neurobiology. Here we describe a new pathway that specifically affects the formation of basal dendrites and axonal projections in cortical pyramidal neurons. We report that thousand-and-one-amino acid 2 kinase (TAOK2), also known as TAO2, is essential for dendrite morphogenesis. TAOK2 downregulation impairs basal dendrite formation in vivo without affecting apical dendrites. Moreover, TAOK2 interacts with Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1), a receptor protein that binds the secreted guidance cue Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A). TAOK2 overexpression restores dendrite formation in cultured cortical neurons from Nrp1(Sema-) mice, which express Nrp1 receptors incapable of binding Sema3A. TAOK2 overexpression also ameliorates the basal dendrite impairment resulting from Nrp1 downregulation in vivo. Finally, Sema3A and TAOK2 modulate the formation of basal dendrites through the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results delineate a pathway whereby Sema3A and Nrp1 transduce signals through TAOK2 and JNK to regulate basal dendrite development in cortical neurons."

By comparing interaction maps for fission and budding yeast, we confirmed widespread conservation of genetic relationships within and between complexes and pathways. However, we identified an important subset of orthologous complexes that have undergone functional ""repurposing"": the evolution of divergent functions and partnerships. We validated three functional repurposing events in S. pombe and mammalian cells and discovered that (1) two lumenal sensors of misfolded ER proteins, the kinase/nuclease Ire1 and the glucosyltransferase Gpt1, act together to mount an ER stress response; (2) ESCRT factors regulate spindle-pole-body duplication; and (3) a membrane-protein phosphatase and kinase complex, the STRIPAK complex, bridges the cis-Golgi, the centrosome, and the outer nuclear membrane to direct mitotic progression.

https://openalex.org/W2064319583,"The role that frontal-striatal circuits play in normal behavior remains unclear. Two of the leading hypotheses suggest that these circuits are important for action selection or reinforcement learning. To examine these hypotheses, we carried out an experiment in which monkeys had to select actions in two different task conditions. In the first (random) condition, actions were selected on the basis of perceptual inference. In the second (fixed) condition, the animals used reinforcement from previous trials to select actions. Examination of neural activity showed that the representation of the selected action was stronger in lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC), and occurred earlier in the lPFC than it did in the dorsal striatum (dSTR). In contrast to this, the representation of action values, in both the random and fixed conditions, was stronger in the dSTR. Thus, the dSTR contains an enriched representation of action value, but it followed frontal cortex in action selection."

https://openalex.org/W1983681582,"This study uses single-channel current measurements, synaptic vesicle fusion–induced capacitance changes and structural modeling of the calyx of Held terminals to show that voltage-dependent calcium channel density at the active zone is a major determinant for the properties of neurotransmitter release and short-term synaptic plasticity. How synaptic-vesicle release is controlled at the basic release structure, the active zone, is poorly understood. By performing cell-attached current and capacitance recordings predominantly at single active zones in rat calyces, we found that single active zones contained 5−218 (mean, 42) calcium channels and 1−10 (mean, 5) readily releasable vesicles (RRVs) and released 0−5 vesicles during a 2-ms depolarization. Large variation in the number of calcium channels caused wide variation in release strength (measured during a 2-ms depolarization) by regulating the RRV release probability (PRRV) and the RRV number. Consequently, an action potential opened ∼1–35 (mean, ∼7) channels, resulting in different release probabilities at different active zones. As the number of calcium-channels determined PRRV, it critically influenced whether subsequent release would be facilitated or depressed. Regulating calcium channel density at active zones may thus be a major mechanism to yield synapses with different release properties and plasticity. These findings may explain large differences reported at synapses regarding release strength (release of 0, 1 or multiple vesicles), PRRV, short-term plasticity, calcium transients and the requisite calcium-channel number for triggering release."

However, while dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been shown to modulate working memory-related neural activity, their role in the cellular basis of learning is unknown. We recorded activity from multiple electrodes while injecting the D1R antagonist SCH23390 in the lateral PFC as monkeys learned visuomotor associations. Blocking D1Rs impaired learning of novel associations and decreased cognitive flexibility but spared performance of already familiar associations. This suggests a greater role for prefrontal D1Rs in learning new, rather than performing familiar, associations. There was a corresponding greater decrease in neural selectivity and increase in alpha and beta oscillations in local field potentials for novel than for familiar associations.

Dopamine neurons fire and release dopamine into the PFC to sensory cues that predict reward (Schultz et al., 1993Schultz W. Apicella P. Ljungberg T.

Biologically based computational models of high-level cognition.Science. 2006; 314: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition, a subset of dopamine neurons is activated by aversive events. Because these events are nonrewarded, some dopamine neurons may encode the stimulus salience rather than its positive value (Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O.

Thus, dopamine signals in the PFC could play a role in adapting cognitive function to different arousal states (e.g., stress or fatigue) (Arnsten et al., 2010Arnsten A.F.T. Paspalas C.D. Gamo N.J.

However, despite the central role dopamine is thought to play in learning, its involvement in modulating neural correlates of learning in the PFC is largely unknown. In addition to understanding D1R function at the single neuron level, additional insight can be gained from the next level up: interactions between networks of neurons. This is often studied by examining oscillations in the local field potentials (LFPs) and coherence in neural activity, which are thought to reflect communication and interactions between neuron populations. In the cortex, oscillations at alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies have been associated with attention and memory (Engel et al., 2001Engel A.K. Fries P. Singer W.

To address these issues, we trained two monkeys in a delayed associative learning task and blocked D1Rs pharmacologically while recording populations of neurons and neural oscillations in the lateral PFC. We have previously shown that during associative learning, neurons in the monkey lateral PFC build up neural information reflecting the acquisition between visual cues and saccades (Asaad et al., 1998Asaad W.F.

In this study, we report that learning of new associations and its neural correlates, but not familiar associations, are impaired by D1R blockade. Two monkeys learned associations between visual cues presented at the center of gaze and saccades to the right or left by trial and error (Figure 1A). Cue and saccade were separated by a short (1,000 ms) memory delay. To compare new learning with well-learned associations, we blocked trials with pairs of novel cues on 80% of the trials (learning trials) and pairs of highly familiar cues on 20% of the trials (familiar trials). Once a pair of new associations was learned (at least 80% correct for each novel cue; see Experimental Procedures), two new cues replaced the previously novel cues and a new block started. Familiar cues remained unchanged for the entire session. Monkeys completed 8–12 blocks per session during training. In each session, monkeys first completed several preinjection (baseline) blocks (Figure 1B). Then, 3 μl of either saline or the D1R antagonist SCH23390 (30 μg) were pressure injected into the dorsolateral or ventrolateral PFC (dlPFC and vlPFC, respectively) through a metal cannula at 0.3 μl/min (see Experimental Procedures). Injections started at the beginning of a block (injection block), and different numbers of baseline blocks were used in different sessions (Figure 1B) to avoid any confounds related to systematic changes in monkeys' behavior with block. The animals never stopped working during the session. We first determined whether the monkeys' performance showed any postinjection learning deficit. A distribution of monkeys' error rates during learning trials was generated by fitting a sigmoid curve to the trial-by-trial performance (Williams and Eskandar, 2006Williams Z.M. Eskandar E.N. Selective enhancement of associative learning by microstimulation of the anterior caudate.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures). The average distribution across the baseline blocks was compared to the distribution from each block after the injection using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. In saline sessions (n = 20), we did not observe any postinjection deficit (p > 0.05; first 60 trials/block, the minimum block length). In 21 of the 30 sessions in which SCH23390 was injected, there were significantly worse learning performances on the injection block and/or the next block relative to baseline blocks (KS, p < 0.05). In fact, for all affected sessions, learning was impaired only on the first two postinjection blocks, even though an affected session was defined as an effect on any postinjection block. Representative examples are shown in Figure 2A. Learning rate was defined as the slope of the sigmoid curve fitted to the trial-by-trial performance, high rates indicating rapid learning. Figure 2B shows the average learning curves and learning rates across saline and affected SCH23390 sessions. The learning rates of the first two blocks after SCH23390 in significantly affected sessions were smaller than the baseline learning rates (logistic regression of the first 60 trials/block in 50 baseline blocks, mean slope = 0.05 ± 0.008 versus 38 postinjection blocks, mean slope = 0.017 ± 0.007; mean ± SEM; Wilcoxon test, p = 0.005). These postinjection learning rates were also smaller than that of the first two blocks after saline injections (40 postsaline injection blocks, mean = 0.06 ± 0.007; p = 1 × 10−4) and smaller than the learning rates of the first two blocks after SCH23390 in unaffected sessions (18 postinjection blocks, mean = 0.12 ± 0.04; p = 3 × 10−5). On average, the impairment lasted 1 hr (59 ± 5 min), during which monkeys completed fewer numbers of blocks because they needed more correct trials to learn the associations (Figure 2C). There was an anatomical dissociation between affected and unaffected sites: most (18 of 21) sessions with a learning deficit followed vlPFC injections, whereas the sites unaffected by SCH23390 were mainly in the dlPFC (Figure 2D, proportion of vlPFC versus dlPFC affected sites; chi-square, p = 9 × 10−5). We did not observe any anterior versus posterior trend for the location of affected sites. Performance for each of the two novel cues was similarly impaired in both animals (see Figure S1 available online). The learning impairment was not due to altered eye movements. We did not observe any major changes in the trajectories or accuracy of the saccades after the injection of SCH23390. The vast majority of saccades during error trials ended within the target window around the incorrect target (<4.0°). In fact, if anything, saccade accuracy somewhat improved after SCH23390: there was an increase in error trial saccades ending within the incorrect target window (88% ± 4% to 95% ± 5% of error trials; t test, p = 0.02). The average eye movement velocities (deg/s) also increased after injection of SCH23390 (from 401 ± 3 deg/s to 422 ± 5 deg/s; p = 4 × 10−4), perhaps due to frustration from the learning impairment and reduction in reward. Errors were not caused by increased impulsivity, a premature saccade toward the correct target before the “go” cue (baseline, 7.4% ± 0.5% of trials; SCH23390, 7.7% ± 0.6%; Wilcoxon test, p = 0.62 versus baseline, p = 0.75 versus saline). But there was a modest increase in perseveration (the average number of consecutive repeats of an error), from 1.6% ± 0.2% of trials during baseline to 4.3% ± 0.6% during the first hour postinjection in affected sites (Wilcoxon test, p = 4 × 10−5), but not after saline (mean = 1.5%, p = 2 × 10−5 versus affected sites) or SCH23390 in unaffected sites (mean = 1%, p = 4 × 10−5 versus affected sites; Figure 2E). In contrast to new learning, performance of familiar associations was unimpaired in all sessions (Figures 2F and S1), and the proportion of perseverative errors was not different from baseline (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.59). Reaction times were shorter for familiar associations than for novel associations during the baseline blocks (122 ± 5 ms versus 133 ± 1 ms, Wilcoxon test, p = 0.003), an effect also observed after the injection of SCH23390 in behaviorally sensitive sites (121 ± 4 ms versus 137 ± 1 ms, p = 6 × 10−4; Figure 2G). We recorded the activity of individual prefrontal neurons from 7–15 electrodes located 1 or 2 mm away from the injection site. Typically, 15–30 isolated neurons could be recorded in each session. Only neurons that were well isolated before and after the injections were included in the analyses (see Experimental Procedures). The injections of saline and SCH23390 induced a small, slow, and steady increase in neuronal activity. The firing rate across all recorded neurons in saline sessions increased from 2.36 ± 0.2 to 2.57 ± 0.21 spikes/s from baseline to postinjection epochs (omitting the first 20 min after the injections; n = 286 neurons; t test, p = 0.07). During SCH23390 sessions, there was an increase from 2.06 ± 0.13 to 2.56 ± 0.2 spikes/s from baseline to postinjection epochs (n = 279 neurons; p = 0.002), which was not different from that during postsaline injection epochs (saline: 2.57 ± 0.21 versus SCH23390: 2.56 ± 0.2 spikes/s, p = 0.96). The small increases in firing rate are often seen and probably due to a mechanical stimulation of the neural tissue. All effects reported below are above and beyond these modest increases in firing rate. With learning, the monkeys were increasingly able to predict which saccade would be required at the end of the trial as soon as the cue appeared early in the trial. As in previous studies, there was a corresponding increase in early trial saccade-predicting activity, especially during cue presentation. By the end of the baseline blocks (last 20 correct trials), almost 30% of randomly selected neurons showed a significant difference in firing rate between the preferred and nonpreferred associated directions during the cue presentation and/or the memory delay (Figures 3A and 3B , top panels; saline, 81 of 286 neurons [28.3%]; SCH23390, 78 of 279 neurons [28%]; analysis of variance [ANOVA] during cue and/or memory delay, p < 0.05; Pasupathy and Miller, 2005Pasupathy A. Miller E.K. Different time courses of learning-related activity in the prefrontal cortex and striatum.Nature. 2005; 433: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The analyses below will focus on this early trial activity. During baseline blocks, a higher proportion of neurons showing such selectivity was observed near sites behaviorally sensitive to SCH23390 than insensitive sites (28.6% versus 9.4%, chi-square, p = 8 × 10−7), suggesting that SCH23390 was most impairing at sites more involved in the task. As the analyses below will show, after SCH23390, but not saline, this neural selectivity was reduced (Figure 3B; see an example neuron in Figure S2). We quantified the neural information about saccade direction on correctly performed trials for each neuron using the percent explained variance (PEV) statistic (Siegel et al., 2009Siegel M. Warden M.R. Miller E.K. Phase-dependent neuronal coding of objects in short-term memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 21341-21346Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar; Buschman et al., 2011Buschman T.J. Siegel M. Roy J.E. Miller E.K. Neural substrates of cognitive capacity limitations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 11252-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). PEV reflects the amount of variance in each neuron's trial-by-trial firing rate that is explained by saccade direction. Higher PEV indicates more selectivity for the predicted saccade (the one associated with the current cue). It was calculated over an eight-correct-trial window stepped by one trial (see Experimental Procedures; Pasupathy and Miller, 2005Pasupathy A. Miller E.K.

https://openalex.org/W2095940963,"NMDA receptor (NMDAR) channels allow Ca2+ influx only during correlated activation of both pre- and postsynaptic cells; a Mg2+ block mechanism suppresses NMDAR activity when the postsynaptic cell is inactive. Although the importance of NMDARs in associative learning and long-term memory (LTM) formation has been demonstrated, the role of Mg2+ block in these processes remains unclear. Using transgenic flies expressing NMDARs defective for Mg2+ block, we found that Mg2+ block mutants are defective for LTM formation but not associative learning. We demonstrate that LTM-dependent increases in expression of synaptic genes, including homer, staufen, and activin, are abolished in flies expressing Mg2+ block defective NMDARs. Furthermore, we show that genetic and pharmacological reduction of Mg2+ block significantly increases expression of a CREB repressor isoform. Our results suggest that Mg2+ block of NMDARs functions to suppress basal expression of a CREB repressor, thus permitting CREB-dependent gene expression upon LTM induction."

However, the mechanism whereby fru establishes the sexual fate of neurons remains enigmatic. Here, we show that Fru forms a complex with the transcriptional cofactor Bonus (Bon), which, in turn, recruits either of two chromatin regulators, Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), which masculinizes individual sexually dimorphic neurons, or Heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a), which demasculinizes them. Manipulations of HDAC1 or HP1a expression change the proportion of male-typical neurons and female-typical neurons rather than producing neurons with intersexual characteristics, indicating that on a single neuron level, this sexual switch operates in an all-or-none manner."
https://openalex.org/W2047113059,"In the absence of sensory stimuli, spontaneous activity in the brain has been shown to exhibit organization at multiple spatiotemporal scales. In the macaque auditory cortex, responses to acoustic stimuli are tonotopically organized within multiple, adjacent frequency maps aligned in a caudorostral direction on the supratemporal plane (STP) of the lateral sulcus. Here, we used chronic microelectrocorticography to investigate the correspondence between sensory maps and spontaneous neural fluctuations in the auditory cortex. We first mapped tonotopic organization across 96 electrodes spanning approximately two centimeters along the primary and higher auditory cortex. In separate sessions, we then observed that spontaneous activity at the same sites exhibited spatial covariation that reflected the tonotopic map of the STP. This observation demonstrates a close relationship between functional organization and spontaneous neural activity in the sensory cortex of the awake monkey."
https://openalex.org/W2011153931,"Acidosis arises in solid and lymphoid malignancies secondary to altered nutrient supply and utilization. Tumor acidosis correlates with therapeutic resistance, although the mechanism behind this effect is not fully understood. Here we show that incubation of lymphoma cell lines in acidic conditions (pH 6.5) blocks apoptosis induced by multiple cytotoxic metabolic stresses, including deprivation of glucose or glutamine and treatment with dexamethasone. We sought to examine the role of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators in this process. Interestingly, we found that acidic culture causes elevation of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, while also attenuating glutamine starvation-induced elevation of p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and Bim. We confirmed with knockdown studies that these shifts direct survival decisions during starvation and acidosis. Importantly, the promotion of a high anti- to pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member ratio by acidosis renders cells exquisitely sensitive to the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist ABT-737, suggesting that acidosis causes Bcl-2 family dependence. This dependence appears to be mediated, in part, by the acid-sensing G protein-coupled receptor, GPR65, via a MEK/ERK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1990631728,"Contrast invariant orientation tuning in simple cells of the visual cortex depends critically on contrast dependent trial-to-trial variability in their membrane potential responses. This observation raises the question of whether this variability originates from within the cortical circuit or the feedforward inputs from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). To distinguish between these two sources of variability, we first measured membrane potential responses while inactivating the surrounding cortex, and found that response variability was nearly unaffected. We then studied variability in the LGN, including contrast dependence, and the trial-to-trial correlation in responses between nearby neurons. Variability decreased significantly with contrast, whereas correlation changed little. When these experimentally measured parameters of variability were applied to a feedforward model of simple cells that included realistic mechanisms of synaptic integration, contrast-dependent, orientation independent variability emerged in the membrane potential responses. Analogous mechanisms might contribute to the stimulus dependence and propagation of variability throughout the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2026081128,"Antipsychotic drugs are effective for the treatment of schizophrenia. However, the functional consequences and subcellular sites of their accumulation in nervous tissue have remained elusive. Here, we investigated the role of the weak-base antipsychotics haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine, and risperidone in synaptic vesicle recycling. Using multiple live-cell microscopic approaches and electron microscopy of rat hippocampal neurons as well as in vivo microdialysis experiments in chronically treated rats, we demonstrate the accumulation of the antipsychotic drugs in synaptic vesicles and their release upon neuronal activity, leading to a significant increase in extracellular drug concentrations. The secreted drugs exerted an autoinhibitory effect on vesicular exocytosis, which was promoted by the inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels and depended on the stimulation intensity. Taken together, these results indicate that accumulated antipsychotic drugs recycle with synaptic vesicles and have a use-dependent, autoinhibitory effect on synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1982586050,"The kinetics of ligand gated ion channels are tuned to permit diverse roles in cellular signaling. To follow high-frequency excitatory synaptic input, postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors must recover rapidly from desensitization. Chimeras between AMPA and the related kainate receptors demonstrate that the ligand binding domains alone control the lifetime of the desensitized state. Mutation of nonconserved amino acids in the lower lobe (domain 2) of the ligand binding domain conferred slow recovery from desensitization on AMPA receptors, and fast recovery on kainate receptors. Single-channel recordings and a correlation between the rate of deactivation and the rate of recovery across panels of mutant receptors revealed that domain 2 also controls ion channel gating.

The AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid) subtype of glutamate receptors can follow synaptic activity in the kilohertz range (Taschenberger and von Gersdorff, 2000Taschenberger H. von Gersdorff H. Fine-tuning an auditory synapse for speed and fidelity: developmental changes in presynaptic waveform, EPSC kinetics, and synaptic plasticity.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9162-9173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because they allow glutamate to unbind rapidly and can recover from desensitization quickly (Colquhoun et al., 1992Colquhoun D. Jonas P. Sakmann B. Action of brief pulses of glutamate on AMPA/kainate receptors in patches from different neurones of rat hippocampal slices.J. Physiol. 1992; 458: 261-287PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, both recombinant and native kainate receptors recover from desensitization about 100-fold more slowly (Bowie and Lange, 2002Bowie D. Lange G.D.

Lerma J. Activation and desensitization properties of native and recombinant kainate receptors.Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Desensitization occurs at synapses even during a single postsynaptic response (Otis et al., 1996Otis T. Zhang S. Trussell L.O. Direct measurement of AMPA receptor desensitization induced by glutamatergic synaptic transmission.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7496-7504PubMed Google Scholar), although this may be masked by fast recovery and lateral mobility of receptors (Frischknecht et al., 2009Frischknecht R. Heine M. Perrais D.

Neurosci. 2009; 12: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Short-term depression due to desensitization facilitates neuronal computation (Rothman et al., 2009Rothman J.S. Cathala L. Steuber V. Silver R.A. Synaptic depression enables neuronal gain control.Nature. 2009; 457: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and normal desensitization of AMPA receptors also appears critical for brain development (Christie et al., 2010Christie L.A. Russell T.A. Xu J. Wood L. Shepherd G.M. Contractor A. AMPA receptor desensitization mutation results in severe developmental phenotypes and early postnatal lethality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 9412-9417Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). AMPA and kainate receptors have the same overall structure (Sobolevsky et al., 2009Sobolevsky A.I. Rosconi M.P. Gouaux E.

A global axis of 2-fold symmetry, perpendicular to the membrane plane, defines dimers of ligand binding domains (LBDs). AMPA and kainate receptors desensitize when this dimer relaxes (Chaudhry et al., 2009aChaudhry C. Plested A.J. Schuck P. Mayer M.L.

Each ligand binding domain is a clamshell which closes upon glutamate binding. Some hydrogen bonds that form between the jaws of the binding domain in GluK2 following glutamate binding are absent in AMPA receptors (Weston et al., 2006bWeston M.C. Gertler C. Mayer M.L. Rosenmund C. Interdomain interactions in AMPA and kainate receptors regulate affinity for glutamate.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7650-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, mutant kainate receptors that lack these interactions still recover slowly from desensitization. Introducing similar interactions to AMPA receptors slows deactivation and decreases glutamate potency sharply, but does not slow recovery profoundly. Hence, interactions distinct from those at the jaws of the ligand binding domain must control the rate of recovery from the desensitized state. Studies of chimeric glutamate receptors have elucidated glutamate receptor gating (Gielen et al., 2009Gielen M. Siegler Retchless B. Mony L. Johnson J.W. Paoletti P.

Chem. 2005; 280: 15053-15060Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In a landmark study, chimeras between GluA3 and GluK2 defined the ligand binding domain (Stern-Bach et al., 1994Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F.

We constructed fully functional reciprocal chimeras of AMPA and kainate receptors, examined their biophysical properties for the first time and employed kinetic modeling to understand their behavior. Subsequently, we identified residues that determine the lifetime of the desensitized state in AMPA and kainate receptors. Our mutant screens reveal a surprising coregulation of channel gating behavior by distributed sites within the lower jaw of the LBD. The pore domains of AMPA and kainate receptors are similar, and removing the amino terminal domain (ATD) does not alter recovery (Pasternack et al., 2002Pasternack A. Coleman S.K. Jouppila A.

For these reasons, and because the LBDs rotate upon entry to desensitization (Armstrong et al., 2006Armstrong N. Jasti J. Beich-Frandsen M. Gouaux E. Measurement of conformational changes accompanying desensitization in an ionotropic glutamate receptor.Cell. 2006; 127: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that interactions determining the rate of recovery from desensitization were localized in the ligand binding domains. We began our search for elements that control recovery from desensitization by constructing chimeric receptors in which we swapped the ligand binding cores between GluA2 (AMPA) and GluK2 (Kainate) receptors (Figure 1A ). These subtypes are present in many native receptor complexes (Sans et al., 2003Sans N. Vissel B. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Chang K. Royle G.A. Wang C.Y. O'Gorman S. Heinemann S.F. Wenthold R.J.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10093-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and form recombinant homomeric receptors that differ about 100-fold in recovery rate. We called the chimeras B2P6, for the LBD from GluA2 with the pore and ATD of GluK2 (GluR6) and B6P2, for the LBD from GluK2 (GluR6) with the pore and ATD of GluA2. Startlingly, in the B2P6 chimera, the presence of the GluA2 LBD conferred extremely fast recovery from desensitization, with a recovery rate of 63 ± 6 s−1 (Figures 1B and 1C, Hodgkin-Huxley-type-fit slope = 2, n = 7), even faster than that of wild-type GluA2 (47 ± 6 s−1, n = 10). This rate of recovery is more than 100-fold quicker than that of GluK2 (0.47 ± 0.03 s−1, monoexponential fit, n = 14). The inverse chimera, B6P2, including the GluK2 LBD, recovered slowly from desensitization (krec = 0.39 ± 0.01 s−1, monoexponential fit, n = 10 patches), also 100-fold slower than wild-type GluA2. To compare fairly between recovery relations with different slopes, we also calculated the time of 50% recovery (t50) for chimeric and wild-type receptors (Figure 1E), which also indicated a complete exchange of the lifetime of the desensitized state with the ligand binding domain. These results show that no part of the kainate receptor outside the binding site contributes to the very slow recovery from desensitization observed in heterologously expressed wild-type GluK2 channels, and in native kainate receptors (Bowie and Lange, 2002Bowie D. Lange G.D. Functional stoichiometry of glutamate receptor desensitization.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, DeVries and Schwartz, 1999DeVries S.H. Schwartz E.A.

Likewise, the fast recovery of recombinant and native AMPA receptors (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang W. Robert A. Vogensen S.B. Howe J.R.

Action of brief pulses of glutamate on AMPA/kainate receptors in patches from different neurones of rat hippocampal slices.J. Physiol. 1992; 458: 261-287PubMed Google Scholar) must be explained entirely by determinants within the LBD. The isolated LBDs of AMPA and kainate receptors are autonomous modules that recapitulate the properties of LBDs in full-length receptors (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000Armstrong N. Gouaux E.

When activated by 10 mM glutamate, both the B2P6 and B6P2 chimeras exhibited fast activation and desensitization similar to wild-type receptors (Figure S1A available online), although the B2P6 chimera desensitized more slowly and less profoundly than wild-type GluA2 (Table 1). However, transplanting the binding domains might produce receptors with strongly shifted affinities for glutamate, which would be expected to alter the lifetime of the desensitized state in wild-type and mutant GluRs (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang W.

To check this, we determined concentration response relations for peak currents following fast application of glutamate (Figure S1B). Wild-type GluA2 had glutamate EC50 of 1,100 ± 140 μM (n = 6 patches). Glutamate was about 9-fold more potent at activating wild-type GluK2 receptors (EC50 = 130 ± 30 μM; n = 4, p = 1.6% versus WT A2; Student's t test). For the B2P6 chimera, the glutamate EC50 was 470 ± 80 μM (n = 6; p = 30% versus WT K2 and 15% versus WT A2) and for the B6P2 chimera, it was 800 ± 150 μM (n = 4; p = 20% versus WT A2 and 8.8% versus WT K2). Thus glutamate activated both chimeras with a similar potency to the wild-type donors, consistent with limited differences in affinity for nondesensitized states.Table 1Kinetic Properties of Wild-Type and Mutant AMPA and Kainate Receptorskrec (s−1)Slopet50 (ms)kdes (s−1)Iss / Ipeakkdeact (s−1)WT A247 ± 6 (10)226 ± 398 ± 5 (25)2.8 ± 0.4%1,300 ± 130 (9)WT K20.47 ± 0.03 (14)11,500 ± 100150 ± 10 (15)0.9 ± 0.3%330 ± 20 (17)B2P663 ± 6 (7)220 ± 281 ± 4 (15)21 ± 1%350 ± 40 (8)B6P20.39 ± 0.01 (10)11,800 ± 50293 ± 15 (18)0.16 ± 0.03%580 ± 140 (3)A2 R675S81 ± 12 (5)215 ± 2108 ± 9 (5)3.9 ± 2.5%1,200 ± 200 (5)A2 M708T68 ± 9 (5)218 ± 2138 ± 15 (5)2.8 ± 1.4%1,400 ± 250 (5)A2 E713T16 ± 3 (6)275 ± 13128 ± 12 (6)1.6 ± 0.6%510 ± 30 (5)A2 K761M72 ± 9 (9)217 ± 2133 ± 10 (9)2.6 ± 0.5%2,100 ± 300 (9)A2 Y768R15 ± 1 (10)147 ± 589 ± 7 (10)8.6 ± 2.3%470 ± 50 (6)A2 K770N27 ± 3 (6)246 ± 5110 ± 20 (6)4.3 ± 1.2%700 ± 200 (6)A2 TR (E713T Y768R)1.1 ± 0.2 (10)1640 ± 110129 ± 8 (14)1.7 ± 0.5%189 ± 17 (7)A2 S652D TR0.4 ± 0.1 (6)12,900 ± 200110 ± 30 (7)3.9 ± 3.3%197 ± 3 (2)K2 E650A0.7 ± 0.1 (5)11,000 ± 100240 ± 20 (5)0.2 ± 0.1%430 ± 50 (5)K2 S679R1.3 ± 0.1 (4)1500 ± 100207 ± 9 (3)0.5 ± 0.3%400 ± 60 (5)K2 M706L2.7 ± 0.3 (9)1250 ± 30200 ± 30 (14)0.8 ± 0.1%2,200 ± 200 (12)K2 T715E0.54 ± 0.06 (7)11,300 ± 100156 ± 10 (5)0.9 ± 0.5%500 ± 100 (5)K2 R769Y0.41 ± 0.06 (5)11,700 ± 200150 ± 10 (6)0.7 ± 0.4%290 ± 30 (6)K2 ---EY0.24 ± 0.01 (6)12,900 ± 100160 ± 20 (6)1.0 ± 0.3%240 ± 30 (3)K2 --LE-3.5 ± 0.5 (6)1200 ± 30180 ± 20 (10)1.1 ± 0.2%1,300 ± 150 (9)K2 --L-Y2.9 ± 0.5 (4)1200 ± 0200 ± 20 (6)0.8 ± 0.1%800 ± 300 (5)K2 --LEY1.60 ± 0.1 (5)1430 ± 20210 ± 10 (6)1.8 ± 0.6%1,200 ± 200 (5)K2 -RLE-4.6 ± 0.4 (11)1150 ± 10180 ± 20 (10)2.6 ± 0.5%1,500 ± 100 (15)K2 ARLE-8.6 ± 0.7 (6)180 ± 10190 ± 40 (6)2.6 ± 0.6%1,500 ± 200 (6)All recovery data were fitted with Hodgkin-Huxley-type relations with the slope fixed to either 1 or 2, as indicated.

The five individual GluK2 point mutants listed here were combined to give double, triple, and quadruple mutants as indicated (in sequential order; dashes represent wild-type residues). AMPA is barely active at homomeric kainate receptors (Egebjerg et al., 1991Egebjerg J. Bettler B. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Heinemann S. Cloning of a cDNA for a glutamate receptor subunit activated by kainate but not AMPA.Nature. 1991; 351: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), because it is sterically excluded from the GluK2 binding site (Mayer, 2005Mayer M.L. Crystal structures of the GluR5 and GluR6 ligand binding cores: molecular mechanisms underlying kainate receptor selectivity.Neuron. 2005; 45: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, and previously published radioligand binding studies (Stern-Bach et al., 1994Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Agonist selectivity of glutamate receptors is specified by two domains structurally related to bacterial amino acid-binding proteins.Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), AMPA (1 mM) activated the B2P6 chimera (61% ± 7% of response to 10 mM glutamate in the same patch, n = 7 patches) and wild-type GluA2, but failed to evoke a response in the B6P2 chimera (Figure S1C). Kainate only partially closes the LBD of GluA2 upon binding (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Mechanisms for activation and antagonism of an AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptor: crystal structures of the GluR2 ligand binding core.Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) and is a very weak partial agonist of the GluA2 channel (Plested and Mayer, 2009Plested A.J. Mayer M.L. AMPA receptor ligand binding domain mobility revealed by functional cross linking.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11912-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but activates kainate receptors efficaciously. Kainate (1 mM) activated a rapidly desensitizing response in the B6P2 chimera that was about one-third the amplitude of that generated by 10 mM glutamate (kdes = 240 ± 70 s−1, peak 28% ± 11%, n = 5 patches), similar to the response of GluK2 wild-type receptors. The response of the B2P6 chimera to 1 mM kainate was small (4% ± 1% of the glutamate peak current, n = 4 patches). Such closely matching preferences for glutamatergic ligands strongly argues that the LBDs were transferred intact. We used selective allosteric modulators to check the integrity of the active dimer interface in the chimeric receptors. Cyclothiazide (CTZ; 100 μM) increased the steady state current in the presence of 10 mM glutamate about 4-fold, to 82% ± 2% of the peak (n = 5 patches) for the B2P6 chimera (Figure S1D). Cyclothiazide blocks desensitization in wild-type GluA2 by 96% (Sun et al., 2002Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), but a point mutation in the CTZ binding site abolishes modulation (Partin et al., 1995Partin K.M. Bowie D. Mayer M.L. Structural determinants of allosteric regulation in alternatively spliced AMPA receptors.Neuron. 1995; 14: 833-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), so this inhibition of desensitization is consistent with an intact dimer-interface binding site for CTZ. Monovalent ions control the kinetics of GluK2 but do not affect GluA2 (Plested et al., 2008Plested A.J.R. Vijayan R. Biggin P.C. Mayer M.L. Molecular basis of kainate receptor modulation by sodium.Neuron. 2008; 58: 720-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ion sensitivity was also swapped according to the donor of the binding domain (Figure S1E). The B6P2 chimera was strongly inhibited upon substitution of cations (CsCl peak current 0.3% ± 0.2% of that in NaCl, n = 5 patches), and anions (NaNO3 peak current 36% ± 15%, n = 4 patches), similar to GluK2 wild-type channels (CsCl, 7%; NO3, 75%; Plested and Mayer, 2007Plested A.J.R. Mayer M.L. Structure and mechanism of kainate receptor modulation by anions.Neuron. 2007; 53: 829-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Small disruptions of the ion binding sites generally invert sensitivity, so the active dimer arrangement in B6P2 channels must be similar to that in GluK2. The B2P6 chimera was completely insensitive to ion exchanges (peak currents, relative to NaCl: 94% ± 1% for CsCl; 95% ± 5%, NaNO3, n = 3, not shown). Glutamate (10 mM) activated a large steady state current at the B2P6 chimera (21% ± 1% of peak, n = 15 patches), reminiscent of the Willardiine series of partial agonists (Jin et al., 2003Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Structural basis for partial agonist action at ionotropic glutamate receptors.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To check that glutamate remains a full agonist at the B2P6 chimera, we estimated open probability using noise analysis (Figures S2A–S2D). Wild-type GluA2 receptors have a high peak open probability (77% ± 7%, n = 5 patches), and the peak open probability of the B2P6 chimera was not significantly different (65 ± 5%, n = 5 patches; p > 0.05, randomization test). Weighted single-channel conductance was also similar (WT A2: 18 ± 3 pS; B2P6: 16 ± 1 pS). Additionally, we checked if quisqualate, which activates a larger current than glutamate in GluA2 mutants where domain closure is hindered (Robert et al., 2005Robert A. Armstrong N. Gouaux J.E. Howe J.R. AMPA receptor binding cleft mutations that alter affinity, efficacy, and recovery from desensitization.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), could activate bigger responses than glutamate at the B2P6 construct (Figures S2E and S2F). Currents activated by quisqualate (2 mM) and glutamate (10 mM) were similar in amplitude (Quis. peak current: 92% ± 8% of that evoked by 10 mM glutamate, n = 5 patches), suggesting that domain closure in the B2P6 channel is normal. These results exclude spurious partial agonism as an explanation for fast recovery, and suggest that the large steady state current in the B2P6 chimera is due to recovery that is even faster than wild-type GluA2. Our recordings of the B2P6 and B6P2 chimeras displayed striking features that we reasoned could constrain parameters in simulations of receptor kinetics and thereby provide insight to the molecular mechanisms determining recovery from desensitization. Our aim was to identify if individual kinetic transitions could explain the observed behavior and, by comparing with existing biophysical studies (Robert et al., 2005Robert A. Armstrong N. Gouaux J.E. Howe J.R. AMPA receptor binding cleft mutations that alter affinity, efficacy, and recovery from desensitization.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2008Zhang W. Cho Y. Lolis E. Howe J.R. Structural and single-channel results indicate that the rates of ligand binding domain closing and opening directly impact AMPA receptor gating.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 932-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), pinpoint the region of the LBD most likely to control recovery. Using a simplified model of GluR activation (see Figure 2A and Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we tried three scenarios to account for changes in recovery rate. First, we varied the lifetime of a deep desensitized state (AD2), from which agonist dissociation was very slow. Second, alterations in the bound lifetime of glutamate might change recovery, and we simulated this on two backgrounds, with initially slow and fast recovery, respectively. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that the equilibrium between resting (AR) and desensitized states (AD) differs between AMPA and kainate receptors. The rate of recovery from desensitization was sensitive to rate changes in each case. Strikingly, changing the rate of exit from the state AD2 (d2–) caused a uniform shift in the recovery rate (krec) over 3 orders of magnitude, comfortably covering the range between GluA2 and GluK2, and our chimeric receptors (Figure 2B). The variation in d2– was the only modification that accounted well for all our observations, including the development of a large steady state current in the presence of 10 mM glutamate for fast recovering channels (B2P6; compare Figure 2C and Figure 1C). Similarly to our observations for chimeric receptors, the peak current-concentration relation was not changed by variation in the exit rate from AD2 (Figure 2D). In contrast, reducing bound lifetime on the background of slow recovery (by changing the rates k– and kd–) could not produce the fast recovery of wild-type GluA2 and B2P6. Although slower recovery is possible by slowing dissociation on a fast recovering background, this is accompanied by major shifts and distortions of the concentration response relation (Figure 2F). This scenario reproduced well the findings of previous reports where mutations at the jaws of the LBDs alter the stability or lifetime of all glutamate bound states (Robert et al., 2005Robert A. Armstrong N. Gouaux J.E. Howe J.R. AMPA receptor binding cleft mutations that alter affinity, efficacy, and recovery from desensitization.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Weston et al., 2006bWeston M.C. Gertler C. Mayer M.L. Rosenmund C. Interdomain interactions in AMPA and kainate receptors regulate affinity for glutamate.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7650-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, apparent affinity was altered little in our chimeras, ruling out changes in resting state affinity as the sole explanation for the physiological difference between AMPA and kainate receptors, and between our chimeras. The similar rate of entry to desensitization for AMPA and kainate receptors, and similar peak open probability, rules out significant changes in the transition AR – AD, but variation in the reverse transition (d1–) could conceivably produce different recovery rates – perhaps corresponding to different re-association kinetics of the active LBD dimers. We repeated the simulations, varying the rate of exit from the AD state, again on two backgrounds, slow and fast exit from the AD2 state (Figure 2G). These simulations failed to give a wide range of recovery rates. Rather, the simulated currents strongly resembled the results of manipulations that stabilize the D1 dimer interface (data not shown). The variation in exit from AD on a background of fast recovery resembled the effect of the L483Y mutant or allosteric modulators such as cyclothiazide (Sun et al., 2002Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).

Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins play a crucial role in inhibiting cytokine signaling and inflammatory gene expression in various cell types, including glial cells. However, mechanisms by which SOCS genes could be up-regulated are poorly understood. This study underlines the importance of gemfibrozil, a Food and Drug Administration-approved lipid-lowering drug, in up-regulating the expression of SOCS3 in glial cells. Gemfibrozil increased the expression of Socs3 mRNA and protein in mouse astroglia and microglia in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, gemfibrozil induced the activation of type IA phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and AKT. Accordingly, inhibition of PI 3-kinase and AKT by chemical inhibitors abrogated gemfibrozil-mediated up-regulation of SOCS3. Furthermore, we demonstrated that gemfibrozil induced the activation of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) via the PI 3-kinase-AKT pathway and that siRNA knockdown of KLF4 abrogated gemfibrozil-mediated up-regulation of SOCS3. Gemfibrozil also induced the recruitment of KLF4 to the distal, but not proximal, KLF4-binding site of the Socs3 promoter. This study delineates a novel property of gemfibrozil in up-regulating SOCS3 in glial cells via PI 3-kinase-AKT-mediated activation of KLF4 and suggests that gemfibrozil may find therapeutic application in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders.

Neuropathological studies indicate that neuroinflammatory responses, including elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, may begin prior to significant loss of neuronal populations in the progression of these diseases (2Frank-Cannon T.C.

The dynamic immune and inflammatory response evoked in the CNS has been attributed mostly to the activation of microglia, CNS-resident macrophage and sensor cells that function as the principal immune effector cell of the CNS responding to any pathological event like infections, trauma, stroke, toxins, and other stimuli (6Hanisch U.K. Kettenmann H. Microglia. Active sensor and versatile effector cells in the normal and pathologic brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). Upon activation, microglia express various proinflammatory cytokines, proinflammatory enzymes, proinflammatory adhesion molecules, etc. The excessive production of these proinflammatory molecules trigger nitrosative and oxidative stress (in case of acute inflammation) and may result in prolonged microglial activation with the sustained production of these molecules (in case of chronic inflammation), which results in perpetuated inflammatory cycle, activating additional microglia, promoting their proliferation, and resulting in further release of inflammatory factors. Thus, the cytokine-mediated inflammatory response plays an important role in initiating and/or enhancing the degenerative process in the inflamed CNS (7Jana M. Palencia C.A. Pahan K.

There are eight SOCS proteins, SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, SOCS4, SOCS5, SOCS6, SOCS7, and the cytokine-induced SRC homology 2 (SH2) protein CIS. Each of the SOCS proteins contains a central SH2 domain, an amino-terminal domain with variable length and sequence, and a carboxyl-terminal 40-amino acid region termed as the SOCS box. In addition, SOCS1 and SOCS3 have a kinase inhibitory region in their amino-terminal domain. The SOCS proteins can be induced by a number of stimuli and inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway using a classic inhibitory feedback loop (8Alexander W.S.

SOCS3-deficient (in hemopoietic and endothelial cell) mice also exhibit IL-1-dependent arthritis, which could be suppressed by forced expression of SOCS3. Again, intracellular administration of cell-penetrating SOCS3 could inhibit the cytokine-mediated acute inflammatory response (15Wong P.K. Egan P.J. Croker B.A. O'Donnell K. Sims N.A. Drake S. Kiu H.

SOCS3 can also inhibit chemokine-mediated chemotaxis in T-cells by binding to the chemokine receptor that attenuates the chemotaxis (16Qin H. Niyongere S.A. Lee S.J. Baker B.J. Benveniste E.N.

All this evidence reinforces the fact that SOCS3 is one of the primary regulators of cytokine-induced inflammatory signaling.

However, a number of recent studies reveal that apart from its lipid-lowering effects, gemfibrozil can also regulate many other signaling pathways responsible for inflammation, switching of T-helper cells, cell-to-cell contact, migration, and oxidative stress (20Roy A.

We examined the efficacy of gemfibrozil, a Food and Drug Administration-approved lipid-lowering drug, in up-regulation of the expression of SOCS3. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that gemfibrozil is capable of increasing the expression of SOCS3 in glial cells via type IA phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-AKT-mediated activation of KLF4. DMEM/F-12 50:50 1×, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and 0.05% trypsin were purchased from Mediatech (Washington, D. C.). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Atlas Biologicals (Fort Collins, CO). Antibiotic-antimycotic, gemfibrozil, and Akt inhibitor (AKT-I) were obtained from Sigma. Wortmannin and LY294002 were obtained from Calbiochem. Microglial cells were isolated from mixed glial cultures as described earlier by us (23Jana M. Jana A. Pal U. Pahan K.

Characterization of amoeboid microglia isolated from developing mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Animal maintenance and experimental protocols were approved by the Rush University Animal Care Committee. Briefly, mixed glial cells were prepared from 7-to 9-day-old mouse pups. On day 9, the mixed glial cultures were washed three times with DMEM/F-12 and subjected to shaking at 240 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C on a rotary shaker. The floating cells were washed and seeded onto plastic tissue culture flasks and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The attached cells were removed by trypsinization and seeded onto new plates for further studies. To monitor purity, cells were immunostained with Abs (Pharmingen) against Mac-1 surface Ag, a marker for microglia/macrophages. 90–95% of this preparation was found to be positive for Mac-1. Mouse BV-2 microglial cells (a gift from V. Bocchini, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy) were also maintained as indicated above. All treatments (with gemfibrozil and PI3K/AKT inhibitors) were done in serum-free DMEM/F-12. Total RNA was isolated from BV-2 and mouse primary astrocytes using RNA-Easy Qiagen (Valencia, CA) kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out as described earlier (25Jana M. Pahan K.

The resulting cDNA was appropriately amplified using Promega Master Mix (Madison, WI) and the following primers (Invitrogen) for murine genes: Socs1 sense, 5′-GGCAGCCGACAATGCGATCT-3′, and antisense, 5′-GATCTGGAAGGGGAAGGAAC-3′; Socs2 sense, 5′-GTTGCCGGAGGAACAGTCCC-3′, and antisense, 5′-ATGCTGCAGAGTGGGTGCTG-3′; Socs3 sense, 5′-CGCCTCAAGACCTTCAGCTC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTGATCCAGGAACTCCCGAA-3′; Klf4 sense, 5′-CCCGGCGGGAAGGGAGAAGA-3′, and antisense, 5′- AACTTGCCCATCAGCCCGCC-3′; Gapdh sense, 5′-GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT CAA CG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTG AAG ACG CCA GTG GAC TC-3′. Amplified products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose (Invitrogen) gels and visualized by ethidium bromide (Invitrogen) staining. Response of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) gene was used as a loading control to ascertain that an equivalent amount of cDNA was synthesized from each sample. The mRNA quantification was performed using the ABI-Prism7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using iTaqTM Fast Supermix With ROX (Bio-Rad) and the following 6-FAM/ZEN/IBFQ-labeled primers for murine genes as follows: Socs3, Klf4, and Gapdh (Integrated DNA Technologies Coralville, IA). The mRNA expression of the targeted genes was normalized to the level of Gapdh mRNA, and data were processed by the ABI Sequence Detection System 1.6 software. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described earlier (26Saha R.N. Jana M. Pahan K. MAPK p38 regulates transcriptional activity of NF-κB in primary human astrocytes via acetylation of p65.J.

Briefly, 8-well chamber slides containing BV-2 or mouse primary microglia or astrocytes cultured to 70–80% confluence were fixed with chilled methanol (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) overnight, followed by two brief rinses with filtered PBS. Samples were blocked with 2% BSA (Fisher Scientific) in PBS containing Tween 20 (Sigma) and Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 30 min and incubated at room temperature under shaking conditions for 2 h in PBS containing the following anti-mouse primary antibodies: SOCS3 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), p-AKT (1:600; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), total AKT (1:600; Cell Signaling), GFAP (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD11b (1:500; Cedarlane Laboratories, Burlington, NC), and MAP-2 (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After four 15-min washes in filtered PBS, slides were further incubated with Cy2-, Cy3-, or Cy5-labeled secondary antibodies (all 1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h under similar shaking conditions. Following four 15-min washes with filtered PBS, cells were incubated for 4–5 min with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:10,000; Sigma). The samples were run in an EtOH and xylene (Fisher) gradient, mounted, and observed under a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES confocal laser-scanning microscope (27Dasgupta S. Jana M. Zhou Y. Fung Y.K. Ghosh S.

Briefly, BV-2 or astrocytes cultured in 12-well plates were transfected with 0.5–1.0 μg/well of control or KLF4 siRNA (Dharmacon RNAi Technologies) complexed with RNAiMax reagent in serum-free DMEM/F containing l-glutamine (Invitrogen) for 5 h. After 5 h, 20% FBS was added at a volume of 1:1 with the transfection media, and cells were further incubated for 36 h. Western blotting was conducted as described earlier (28Saha R.N. Liu X.

Briefly, cells were scraped in double-distilled H2O and SDS and electrophoresed on NuPAGE® Novex® 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen), and proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using the Thermo-Pierce Fast Semi-Dry Blotter. The membrane was then washed for 15 min in TBS plus Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked for 1 h in TBST containing BSA. Next, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C under shaking conditions with the following 1° antibodies: SOCS3 (1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AKT, p-AKT (1:600; Cell Signaling), β-actin (1:800; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), p110α, p110β, and p110γ (all 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and KLF4 (1:500, Abcam). The next day, membranes were washed in TBST for 1 h, incubated in 2° antibodies against 1° antibody hosts (all 1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature, washed for 1 more h, and visualized under the Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System (Li-COR, Lincoln, NE). Protein blots were analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda), and bands were normalized to their respective β-actin loading controls. Data are representative of the average fold change with respect to control for three independent experiments. Neuronal membranes were isolated to determine the recruitment of various membrane-associated proteins to the membrane. Cells were washed with PBS and scraped in phenol red-free Hanks' balanced salt solution to 5-ml ultracentrifuge tubes. The solution was then diluted with 100 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 11.5, and spun in an ultracentrifuge at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant liquid was aspirated, and the pellet was immersed in double-distilled H2O and SDS and stored at −80 °C overnight. The following day, the pellet was resuspended by repeated grinding and boiling. DNA binding activity of KLF4 was analyzed by nonradioactive electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). After treatment, cells were washed with PBS, scraped into 1.5-ml tubes, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 500 rpm. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in a membrane lysis buffer composed of HEPES, pH 8.0, MgCl2, KCl, dithiothreitol (DTT), and protease/phosphatase inhibitors, vortexed, and centrifuged at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm for 3 min. Again, the supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in a high salt nuclear envelope lysis buffer composed of HEPES, pH 8.0, MgCl2, glycerol, NaCl, EDTA, DTT, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors, rotated vigorously at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The resultant nuclear extract pellet was frozen at −80 °C overnight, resuspended in a mixture of binding buffer, 10× Orange Loading Dye (Li-Cor Biosciences), a custom-designed fluorescent KLF4-specific probe (Li-Cor Biosciences), and salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed on custom-cast 6% polyacrylamide gels. The shift was visualized under the Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor). BV-2 cells were treated with 50 μm gemfibrozil for different time points, and cell extracts were first precleared with 25 μl of protein A-agarose (50%, v/v). The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-phosphoserine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose-antigen-antibody complexes were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 60 s at 4 °C. The pellets were washed five times with 1 ml of IPH buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min each time at 4 °C. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with the anti-KLF4. ChIP assays were performed using a kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 2 × 106 microglial cells preincubated with gemfibrozil for 2 h were stimulated with LPS. After 3 h of stimulation, cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde (1% final concentration), and cross-linked adducts were resuspended and sonicated, resulting in an average chromatin fragment size of 400 bp. ChIP was performed on the cell lysate by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 2 μg of Abs against KLF4 (and normal IgG as negative control) followed by incubation with protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. The beads were washed and incubated with elution buffer. To reverse the cross-linking and purify the DNA, precipitates were incubated in a 65 °C incubator overnight and digested with proteinase K. DNA samples were then purified and precipitated, and precipitates were washed with 75% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer. The following primers were used to amplify fragments flanking proximal KLF4-binding elements in the mouse Socs3 promoter: Set1 sense, 5′-GGT TGG CAC GGG ATG CTT GGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGT TCT AGG AGG CCA GCC GGG-3′; Set2 sense, 5′-ACG TCC CTT TTG GTT GGC ACG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCC AGC CGG GAG AGG CT-3′. The following primers were used to amplify fragments flanking distal KLF4-binding elements in the mouse Socs3 promoter: Set1 sense, 5′-CTCCCATCGCGACGCCCC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CGCGGCGCCAGCCTT-3′; Set2 sense, 5′-CCCCGCCTCTGCCAGAAACC-3′, and antisense 5′-CAGCCTTGGCCGAGCGTTCC-3′. The PCRs were repeated by using varying cycle numbers and different amounts of templates to ensure that results were in the linear range of PCR. Values are expressed as means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses for differences were performed via Student's t test. This criterion for statistical significance was p < 0.05. The up-regulation of SOCS proteins could be immensely useful in inhibiting the cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses in the CNS (10Baker B.J. Akhtar L.N. Benveniste E.N. SOCS1 and SOCS3 in the control of CNS immunity.Trends Immunol. 2009; 30: 392-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We examined if gemfibrozil could up-regulate the expression of SOCS proteins in mouse BV-2 microglial cells and primary microglia. We found that gemfibrozil indeed up-regulated the mRNA expression of Socs1, Socs2, and Socs3 within 1 h of treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). This induction was dose-dependent, and the maximum increase in Socs3 mRNA (almost 13-fold) was observed at 50 μm gemfibrozil (Fig. 1B). Time course study showed that induction of SOCS genes started from as early as 15 min and peaked at 60 min (∼12-fold) (Fig. 1, C and D). We further checked the SOCS3 protein levels in BV-2 cells. We observed an ∼3–5-fold increase in the protein levels of SOCS3 in BV-2 cells when treated with gemfibrozil in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which is consistent with our mRNA findings. The SOCS3 protein levels were normalized to β-actin, and densitometric analysis showed a maximum increase with 50 μm gemfibrozil (>3-fold), and the time course study revealed steady increase of SOCS3 over time (4–6-fold) (Fig. 1, E and F). Next, we examined if gemfibrozil could up-regulate the expression of SOCS3 in primary microglia. Therefore, we treated mouse primary microglia with gemfibrozil for several minutes and conducted double label immunofluorescence. Similar to that observed in BV-2 microglial cells, gemfibrozil markedly increased the expression of SOCS3 protein in primary microglia at different times of stimulation (Fig. 1G). To further extend our findings in microglia, we took mouse primary astrocytes and conducted both mRNA and protein expression analyses for SOCS3. The quantitative RT-PCR on astrocytes treated with gemfibrozil in a dose- and time-dependent manner showed similar patterns of mRNA expression as observed in microglia. The maximum increase in Socs3 mRNA levels was with 50 μm gemfibrozil (>12-fold), and a significant increase was found as early as 15 min (∼5-fold) and a maximum was at 60 min (∼9-fold) post-treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). In the protein study, we also observed an almost 3-fold increase in the SOCS3 protein levels by gemfibrozil in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). The protein levels were normalized to β-actin, and the densitometry analysis confirmed that the maximum increase (∼3-fold) was at 50 μm gemfibrozil. We also performed a time course for SOCS3 and observed an almost 8-fold increase at 90 min of stimulation (Fig. 2D). To confirm our findings further, we performed immunofluorescence in mouse primary astrocytes. It is evident from Fig. 2E, gemfibrozil up-regulated the expression of SOCS3 protein in primary astrocytes in a time-dependent manner. A number of cytokines and other biomolecules have been reported to induce SOCS3 (9Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Rothman P.

However, there are a few pharmacological compounds that are capable of up-regulating SOCS3, and the mechanism of drug-induced up-regulation of SOCS3 is also poorly understood.

Hagan and colleagues now reveal a further role for the SIN kinase Sid2 that is independent of other known SIN components, in the control of entry into mitosis through phosphorylation of the NIMA kinase Fin1. Mitotic exit integrates the reversal of the phosphorylation events initiated by mitotic kinases with a controlled cytokinesis event that cleaves the cell in two. The mitotic exit network (MEN) of budding yeast regulates both processes, whereas the fission yeast equivalent, the septum initiation network (SIN), controls only the execution of cytokinesis. The components and architecture of the SIN and MEN are highly conserved1. At present, it is assumed that the functions of the core SIN–MEN components are restricted to their characterized roles at the end of mitosis. We now show that the NDR (nuclear Dbf2-related) kinase component of the fission yeast SIN, Sid2–Mob1, acts independently of the other known SIN components in G2 phase of the cell cycle to control the timing of mitotic commitment. Sid2–Mob1 promotes mitotic commitment by directly activating the NIMA (Never In Mitosis)-related kinase Fin1. Fin1’s activation promotes its own destruction, thereby making Fin1 activation a transient feature of G2 phase. This spike of Fin1 activation modulates the activity of the Pom1/Cdr1/Cdr2 geometry network towards Wee1."

The R444L missense mutation in the human V-ATPase a3 subunit (TCIRG1) is one of several known mutations in a3 and other proteins that can cause this disease. The autosomal recessive R444L mutation results in a particularly malignant form of infantile osteopetrosis that is lethal in infancy, or early childhood. We have studied this mutation using the pMSCV retroviral vector system to integrate the cDNA construct for green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused a3R445L mutant protein into the RAW 264.7 mouse osteoclast differentiation model. In comparison with wild-type a3, the mutant glycoprotein localized to the ER instead of lysosomes and its oligosaccharide moiety was misprocessed, suggesting inability of the core-glycosylated glycoprotein to traffic to the Golgi. Reduced steady-state expression of the mutant protein, in comparison with wild type, suggested that the former was being degraded, likely through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. In differentiated osteoclasts, a3R445L was found to degrade at an increased rate over the course of osteoclastogenesis. Limited proteolysis studies suggested that the R445L mutation alters mouse a3 protein conformation. Together, these data suggest that Arg-445 plays a role in protein folding, or stability, and that infantile malignant osteopetrosis caused by the R444L mutation in the human V-ATPase a3 subunit is another member of the growing class of protein folding diseases.

Apart from this, when applied at high doses, rhEpo crosses the blood-brain barrier, triggering protective neuronal effects. Here we show a fundamental new role by which the presence of Epo in the brain augments exercise performance without altering red blood cell production. Two different animal models, the transgenic mouse line Tg21, which constitutively overexpresses human Epo exclusively in the brain without affecting erythropoiesis, and wild-type mice treated with a single high dose of rhEpo, demonstrate an unexpected improvement in maximal exercise performance independent of changes in total hemoglobin mass, as well as in whole blood volume and cardiovascular parameters. This novel finding builds a more complete understanding regarding the central effects of endogenously produced and exogenously applied Epo on exercise performance.—Schuler, B., Vogel, J., Grenacher, B., Jacobs, R.

https://openalex.org/W2045072282,"Legionella is a pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium that can multiply inside of eukaryotic cells. It translocates numerous bacterial effector proteins into target cells to transform host phagocytes into a niche for replication. One effector of Legionella pneumophila is the glucosyltransferase Lgt1, which modifies serine 53 in mammalian elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death. Here, we demonstrate that similar to mammalian cells, Lgt1 was severely toxic when produced in yeast and effectively inhibited in vitro protein synthesis. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, which were deleted of endogenous eEF1A but harbored a mutant eEF1A not glucosylated by Lgt1, were resistant toward the bacterial effector. In contrast, deletion of Hbs1, which is also an in vitro substrate of the glucosyltransferase, did not influence the toxic effects of Lgt1. Serial mutagenesis in yeast showed that Phe(54), Tyr(56) and Trp(58), located immediately downstream of serine 53 of eEF1A, are essential for the function of the elongation factor. Replacement of serine 53 by glutamic acid, mimicking phosphorylation, produced a non-functional eEF1A, which failed to support growth of S. cerevisiae. Our data indicate that Lgt1-induced lethal effect in yeast depends solely on eEF1A. The region of eEF1A encompassing serine 53 plays a critical role in functioning of the elongation factor."
https://openalex.org/W2124269839,"One of the key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the accumulation of the APP-derived amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in the brain. Altered copper homeostasis has also been reported in AD patients and is thought to increase oxidative stress and to contribute to toxic Aβ accumulation and regulate APP metabolism. The potential involvement of the N-terminal APP copper binding domain (CuBD) in these events has not been investigated. Based on the tertiary structure of the APP CuBD, we examined the histidine residues of the copper binding site (His(147), His(149), and His(151)). We report that histidines 149 and 151 are crucial for CuBD stability and APP metabolism. Co-mutation of the APP CuBD His(149) and His(151) to asparagine decreased APP proteolytic processing, impaired APP endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking, and promoted aberrant APP oligomerization in HEK293 cells. Expression of the triple H147N/H149N/H151N-APP mutant led to up-regulation of the unfolded protein response. Using recombinant protein encompassing the APP CuBD, we found that insertion of asparagines at positions 149 and 151 altered the secondary structure of the domain. This study identifies two APP CuBD residues that are crucial for APP metabolism and suggests an additional role of this domain in APP folding and stability besides its previously identified copper binding activity. These findings are of major significance for the design of novel AD therapeutic drugs targeting this APP domain."
https://openalex.org/W2158627775,"Organ size control is a long-standing question in biology. In mammals, using conditional cell ablation, two mutually exclusive mechanisms involving either intrinsic or extrinsic programs have been described to control organ size. The mammary gland is an ideal model for such studies, since it undergoes size and morphological changes during puberty and pregnancy. The role of stem cells in controlling mammary epithelial tree size is unclear, although mammary stem cells are able to reconstitute a functional organ on transplantation. Here, we show that mammary gland cellularity was strictly dependent on mammary stem cell number, even following a 20-fold expansion of the mammary stem cell pool at puberty and transient 3-fold expansions with each pregnancy. In addition, the expansion of the mammary stem cell pool was hormone dependent, as demonstrated by female bilateral ovariectomies during puberty and transplants of male-derived cells into female recipients. In these transplants, apart from a mammary stem cell expansion, we also observed the donor cells reconstituting functional mammary glands, developing alveolar structures, and secreting milk after the recipient's parturition. Taken together, these data suggest that in the mammary gland, there is a third organ size control mechanism, combining intrinsic cues throughout the organism's lifetime, with extrinsic hormone signals at particular developmental windows (puberty, pregnancy), where an expansion of the mammary stem cell pool occurs. This mechanism might have strong implications for the understanding of mammary tumorigenesis, since the expansion of the mammary stem cell pool precedes the generation of breast tumors.—Diaz-Guerra, E., Lillo, M.
