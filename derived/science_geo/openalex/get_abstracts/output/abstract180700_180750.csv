In this study, we analyzed globular domain adiponectin (gAd) transgenic (Tg) mice crossed with leptin-deficient ob/ob or apoE-deficient mice. Interestingly, despite an unexpected similar body weight, gAd Tg ob/ob mice showed amelioration of insulin resistance and β-cell degranulation as well as diabetes, indicating that globular adiponectin and leptin appeared to have both distinct and overlapping functions. Amelioration of diabetes and insulin resistance was associated with increased expression of molecules involved in fatty acid oxidation such as acyl-CoA oxidase, and molecules involved in energy dissipation such as uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 and increased fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle of gAd Tg ob/ob mice. Moreover, despite similar plasma glucose and lipid levels on an apoE-deficient background, gAd Tg apoE-deficient mice showed amelioration of atherosclerosis, which was associated with decreased expression of class A scavenger receptor and tumor necrosis factor α. This is the first demonstration that globular adiponectin can protect against atherosclerosis in vivo. In conclusion, replenishment of globular adiponectin may provide a novel treatment modality for both type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis.

However, the molecular basis for that association remains to be elucidated. The adipose tissue itself serves as the site of triglyceride (TG)1 storage and free fatty acid (FFA)/glycerol release in response to changing energy demands (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S.

Dr. Lodish and co-workers (19Fruebis J. Tsao T.S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D. Erickson M.R. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) have reported that a globular Acrp30 increases fatty acid oxidation in muscle and causes weight loss in mice. We have also shown that treatment with recombinant adiponectin increased fatty acid oxidation in muscle, thereby ameliorating insulin resistance in obese mice (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that insulin resistance in lipoatrophic mice was completely reversed by the combination of physiological doses of adiponectin and leptin, but only partially by either adiponectin or leptin alone (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that leptin and adiponectin may be two major insulin-sensitizing hormones secreted from adipose tissue; however, it has not yet been clarified whether leptin and adiponectin have distinct or overlapping functions in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. Moreover, in relation to regulation of body weight, leptin has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of body weight, whereas the role of adiponectin in this process has been controversial (19Fruebis J. Tsao T.S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D. Erickson M.R. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 20Yamauchi T.

Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar). Most recently, adiponectin-deficient mice were reported to display insulin resistance, glucose intolerance (21Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Yamauchi T. Kubota T. Moroi M. Matsui J. Eto K. Yamashita T.

However, it remains to be determined whether overexpression of adiponectin could indeed ameliorate diabetes and atherosclerosisin vivo. To examine whether overexpression of adiponectin is protective against diabetes and atherosclerosis in vivo, we analyzed globular adiponectin (gAd) transgenic (Tg) mice crossed with leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (7Friedman J.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) or with a well established animal model of atherosclerosis, apoE-deficient mice (23Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Cell. 1992; 81: 343-353Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1848) Google Scholar, 24Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar), since treatment with gAd for 2 weeks had been previously shown to ameliorate insulin resistance more potently than full-length (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar). gAd Tg ob/ob mice showed amelioration of diabetes and insulin resistance. Moreover, gAd Tg ob/ob mice showed increased plasma insulin levels in response to glucose despite amelioration of insulin resistance, which appeared to be due to the amelioration of β-cell degranulation. Amelioration of diabetes and insulin resistance was associated with increased expression of molecules involved in fatty acid oxidation such as acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) and molecules involved in energy dissipation such as uncoupling protein (UCP) 2 and 3, and increased fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle of gAd Tg ob/ob mice. Unexpectedly, they did not show amelioration of obesity presumably due to compensatory increase in food intake for increased energy expenditure. Furthermore, despite similar plasma glucose and lipid levels on an apoE-deficient background, we showed that gAd Tg apoE-deficient mice showed amelioration of atherosclerosis, which was associated with decreased expression of class A scavenger receptor and TNFα. Thus, adiponectin could compensate for leptin deficiency at least in part in insulin resistance and β-cell degranulation, but not in obesity, indicating that adiponectin and leptin appeared to have both distinct and overlapping functions. Moreover, we showed that gAd may stimulate fatty acid oxidation directly only in skeletal muscle but not in the liver. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that adiponectin has anti-atherogenic properties in vivoindependent of conventional atherogenic risk factors. A fusion gene was designed, comprising the human serum amyloid P component (SAP) promoter (25Ogawa Y. Masuzaki H. Hosoda K. Aizawa-Abe M. Suga J. Suda M. Ebihara K. Iwai H. Matsuoka N. Satoh N.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1822-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and mouse globular adiponectin cDNA coding sequences (Fig. 1 A), so that the hormone expression be targeted to the liver (Fig. 1 C), since there is the possibility that overexpression of a hormone such as leptin can induce complete disappearance of its original site of production, the adipose tissue (25Ogawa Y. Masuzaki H. Hosoda K. Aizawa-Abe M. Suga J. Suda M. Ebihara K. Iwai H. Matsuoka N. Satoh N. Odaka H. Kasuga H. Fujisawa Y. Inoue G. Nishimura H. Yoshimasa Y. Nakao K.

The purified HindIII-XhoI fragment was microinjected into the pronucleus of fertilized C57BL6 mice (Nippon CREA, Tokyo, Japan) eggs. Transgenic founder mice were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNAs using the cDNA probe to the BglII/HincII site in globular adiponectin. Transgenic mice were used as heterozygotes. The gAd Tg, ob/ob (7Friedman J.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) and apoE-deficient mice (23Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A.

Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar) used in this study were all on a B6 background. To generate gAd Tg ob/+ or apoE+/−mice, conceptuses that were obtained by in vitro fertilization of ova from ob/+ or apoE−/−female mice and sperm from gAd Tg male mice were implanted into pseudopregnant foster mothers, as previously described (26Yamauchi T. Oike Y. Kamon J. Waki H. Komeda K. Tsuchida A. Date Y., Li, M.X. Miki H. Akanuma Y. Nagai R. Kimura S. Saheki T. Nakazato M. Naitoh T. Yamamura K. Kadowaki T. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). No significant differences in the body weight, glucose and lipid metabolism, and atherosclerosis were observed between wild-type mice and ob/+ or apoE+/− mice (data not shown). Then, to generate gAd Tg ob/ob or apoE−/−mice, conceptuses that were obtained by in vitro fertilization of ova from ob/+ or apoE+/− female mice and sperm from the resultant gAd Tg ob/+ or apoE+/−male mice were implanted into pseudopregnant foster mothers. All the experiments in this study were performed using male mice unless otherwise stated. Male mice 8 weeks of age were fed an indicated powdered diet for indicated time periods according to previously described methods (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar). For example, our high fat diet contains oil, 1152 g (from Benibana, Japan; safflower oil (high oleic type) contained 46% oleic acid (18:1n-9) and 45% linoleic acid (18:2n-6) from total fatty acids); casein, 1191.6 g (from Oriental Yeast, No. 19); sucrose, 633.6 g (from Oriental Yeast, No. 13); vitamin mixture, 50.4 g (from Oriental Yeast, No. 20 (AIN76); mineral mixture, 352.8 g (from Oriental Yeast, No. 25 (AIN76); cellulose powder, 201.6 g (from Oriental Yeast, No. 19);dl-methionine, 18 g (from Wako Pure Chemicals); water, 360 ml; Total, 3600 g. Cumulative food intake was measured using transgenic and nontransgenic littermates daily over a 2-week period. For some experiments, the same amounts of food were given to the pair-fed group of gAd Tg ob/ob mice as to nontransgenic ob/ob littermates. The Tokyo University Graduate School of Medicine Committee on Animal Research approved all experimental procedures. The glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were carried out according to previously described methods (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar). Plasma glucose, serum FFA, TChol, and TG levels were determined by the glucose B-test, NEFA C-test, TChol E-type, and TG L-type (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), respectively. For analysis of lipoprotein distribution, pooled serum samples from five mice per group were subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (SRL). Plasma insulin was measured by an insulin immunoassay (Morinaga Institute of Biological Science, Yokohama, Japan) (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar). Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were determined by a Quintikine M kit (R & D Systems Inc.) and mouse adiponectin radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit (LINCO Research Inc.), respectively (21Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Yamauchi T. Kubota T. Moroi M. Matsui J. Eto K. Yamashita T. Kamon J. Satoh H. Yano W. Froguel P. Nagai R. Kimura S. Kadowaki T. Noda T. J. Biol.

Hashimoto) or mouse UCP2 (Dr. K. Motojima), or mouse UCP3 or adiponectin cDNA (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O.

Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in each band was quantified as described (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar), and the fold change in each mRNA was calculated after correction for loading differences by measuring the amount of 28 S rRNA. Plasma adiponectin levels were determined by immunoblotting as described (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat.

Representative data from one of more than three independent experiments are shown. 20 sections of islets were evaluated for morphometry. The isolated pancreas was immersion-fixed in Bouin's solution at 4 °C overnight. Tissues were routinely processed for paraffin-embedding, and 4-μm sections were cut and mounted on silanized slides. Pancreatic sections were double-stained with anti-insulin (brown) and cocktails of anti-glucagon, anti-somatostatin, and anti-pancreatic polypeptide antibodies (red). The amounts of β-cells and non-β-cells were calculated as the proportions of the area of β-cells or non-β-cells, assessed by immunostaining, to the area of the whole pancreas. More than 50 islets were analyzed per mouse in each group. Isolation of islets from mice was carried out as described previously (27Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Suzuki R. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Lesniak M. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Akanuma Y. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In brief, after clamping the common bile duct at a point close to the duodenum outlet, 2.5 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (27Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Suzuki R. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Lesniak M. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Akanuma Y. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) containing 10 mg of collagenase (Sigma) was injected into the duct. The swollen pancreas was taken out and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. The pancreas was dispersed by pipetting and washed twice with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer. Islets were collected by manual picking. Single cells were isolated with trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) as previously described (27Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Suzuki R. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Lesniak M. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Akanuma Y. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) with some modification. Isolated islets were extracted in acid ethanol at −20 °C, and their insulin content was measured by RIA. Measurements of [14C]CO2production from [1-14C]palmitic acid were performed using liver and muscle slices, as described (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T.

Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar). Liver and muscle homogenates were extracted, and their TG content was determined as described previously (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed murine globular adiponectin (gAd) were purified as previously described (20Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar). gAd produced in a mammalian expression system were isolated and purified from NIH-3T3 cells that were stably expressing gAd, as previously described (17Berg A.H. Combs T.P., Du, X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar). ActiClean Etox affinity columns (Sterogene Bioseparations) were used to remove potential endotoxin contaminations. No significant differences in the PPARα ligands activities in C2C12 myocytes and isolated hepatocytes were observed between the bacterially expressed gAd and the gAd produced by the mammalian expression system (data not shown). Differentiated C2C12 myocytes (19Fruebis J. Tsao T.S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D. Erickson M.R. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PPARα ligands activities were quantitatively determined using a (UAS)x4-tk-LUC reporter plasmid, a GAL4-rat PPARα ligand-binding domain expression plasmid, and a β-galactosidase expression plasmid as the internal control as described previously (26Yamauchi T. Oike Y. Kamon J. Waki H. Komeda K. Tsuchida A. Date Y., Li, M.X. Miki H. Akanuma Y. Nagai R. Kimura S. Saheki T. Nakazato M. Naitoh T. Yamamura K. Kadowaki T. Nat.

En face Sudan IV staining of the excised aortas from the arch to the common iliac levels was performed after fixation in phosphate-buffered 10% formaldehyde (28Imai Y. Shindo T. Maemura K. Sata M. Saito Y. Kurihara Y. Akishita M. Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Tobe K. Morita H. Oh-hashi Y. Suzuki T. Maekawa H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Kurihara H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1310-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Percentages of en face Sudan IV-positive areas to total aortic areas were calculated. Quantitative analyses were performed by computer-assisted planimetry using NIH Image software. Atherosclerotic lesions were quantified in the aortic valve of each mouse as described previously (29Sakamoto H. Aikawa M. Hill C.C. Weiss D. Taylor W.R. Libby P. Lee R.T. Circulation. 2001; 104: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, the OCT-embedded, frozen aortic valves were sectioned serially at 10-μm thickness for a total of 300 μm beginning at the base of the aortic valve, where all three leaflets are first visible. Every fourth section for a total of five sections from each animal was stained with Oil-Red O to identify the lipid-rich lesions. The mouse aortic valve lesions were analyzed immunohistochemically with the following antibodies: anti-mouse macrophage Mac-3 (PharMingen) and anti-mouse SRA 2F8 (Serotec). To determine the proportion of SRA-positive macrophages for each animal, the total number of cells positive for Mac-3 or SRA in atherosclerotic plaques of the aorta was counted for each section. To avoid bias, two investigators who were unaware of the type of staining or assignment of group were asked to determine the proportion of SRA-positive macrophages. To elucidate the metabolic consequences of increased effects of adiponectin on a long-term basis in vivo, we produced transgenic mice with elevated plasma concentrations of globular adiponectin (gAd). A fusion gene was designed, comprising the human SAP promoter (25Ogawa Y. Masuzaki H. Hosoda K. Aizawa-Abe M. Suga J. Suda M. Ebihara K. Iwai H. Matsuoka N. Satoh N. Odaka H. Kasuga H. Fujisawa Y.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1822-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and mouse globular adiponectin cDNA coding sequences, so that the hormone expression might be targeted to the liver (Fig. 1 A). Several transgenic lines on a C57BL6 background (B6) with different copy numbers of the transgene were obtained (Fig. 1 B). The 4.5-kb band corresponded to the endogenous gene and the 0.5-kb band to the gAd transgene (Fig. 1 B). Northern blot analysis identified a single mRNA species found in the liver from gAd (Fig. 1 C), but not in other tissues we studied (data not shown). Plasma gAd concentrations were elevated significantly in transgenic mice in proportion to the transgene copy number (Fig. 1 D). In transgenic mice carrying 10 copies of the gAd transgene (Fig. 1 B), plasma gAd levels in transgenic mice were approximately one-tenth of plasma full-length adiponectin levels in nontransgenic littermates (data not shown). Transgenic mice overexpressing gAd were viable throughout adulthood with no appreciable complications. During postnatal development, no significant differences in body weight (wild-type: 20.8 ± 1.4 g; gAd Tg: 20.1 ± 1.1 g, male mice 8 weeks of age), linear growth and histology (data not shown) were observed between nontransgenic control B6 and gAd Tg mice. The plasma adiponectin (wild-type: 11.4 ± 1.7 μg/ml; gAd Tg: 12.8 ± 1.2 μg/ml) and leptin levels (wild-type: 4.5 ± 0.7 ng/ml; gAd Tg: 4.1 ± 0.9 ng/ml) were not significantly different. To elucidate the long term effects of globular adiponectin on glucose metabolism, we measured plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in transgenic mice overexpressing globular adiponectin. No significant differences in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were noted between gAd Tg mice and nontransgenic littermates on a high carbohydrate (HC) diet (data not shown). Even on an HF diet, there were no significant differences in body weight between gAd Tg mice and nontransgenic littermates (data not shown). Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed using gAd Tg and nontransgenic littermates on the HF diet. After intraperitoneal glucose injection, plasma glucose and insulin levels were significantly lower in gAd Tg mice than those in nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 1,E and F). When mice were injected with insulin, the hypoglycemic response was signific"

The upstream regulators of this pathway are unknown. We now demonstrate that 17β-estradiol rapidly activates eNOS through Src kinase in human endothelial cells. The Src family kinase specific-inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) abrogates 17β-estradiol- but not ionomycin-stimulated NO release. Consistent with these results, PP2 blocked 17β-estradiol-induced Akt phosphorylation but did not inhibit NO release from cells transduced with a constitutively active Akt. PP2 abrogated 17β-estradiol-induced activation of PI3-kinase, indicating that the PP2-inhibitable kinase is upstream of PI3-kinase and Akt. A 17β-estradiol-induced estrogen receptor/c-Src association correlated with rapid c-Src phosphorylation. Moreover, transfection of kinase-dead c-Src inhibited 17β-estradiol-induced Akt phosphorylation, whereas constitutively active c-Src increased basal Akt phosphorylation. Estrogen stimulation of murine embryonic fibroblasts with homozygous deletions of the c-src, fyn, and yes genes failed to induce Akt phosphorylation, whereas cells maintaining c-Src expression demonstrated estrogen-induced Akt activation. Estrogen rapidly activated c-Src inducing an estrogen receptor, c-Src, and P85 (regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase) complex formation. This complex formation results in the successive activation of PI3-kinase, Akt, and eNOS with consequent enhanced NO release, implicating c-Src as a critical upstream regulator of the estrogen-stimulated PI3-kinase/Akt/eNOS pathway. 17β-Estradiol activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), enhancing nitric oxide (NO) release from endothelial cells via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt pathway.

Garcia-Cardena G. Sarrel P. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Many factors regulate eNOS enzyme activity, including fatty acid modification, subcellular localization, and binding to numerous proteins and cofactors, including calmodulin, caveolin-1, the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90), and tetrahydrobiopterin (see Ref. 6Fulton D. Gratton J.P. Sessa W.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 818-824PubMed Google Scholar for review). eNOS is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme, the activity of which is also regulated by phosphorylation. Specific phosphorylation of eNOS by the serine/threonine kinase Akt renders the enzyme more active at much lower Ca2+ concentrations (7McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that the ER-dependent activation of eNOS occurs at resting Ca2+ concentrations and requires activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt pathway (9Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase, P85, acts to stabilize and inhibit the catalytic activity of PI3-kinase. Recently, ER was shown to specifically bind to P85 in vitro (10Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). The E2-induced association correlated with increases in PI3-kinase activity in EC. However, the specific mechanism for E2 activation of PI3-kinase is not known. Evidence is emerging that membrane forms of steroid hormone receptors exist and participate in signaling pathways (11Pappas T.C. Gametchu B. Watson C.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 12Russell K. Haynes M. Sinha D. Clerisme E. Bender J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The activity of E2 at the cell membrane has been shown in EC, neurons, and breast cancer cell lines. We previously determined that rapid E2 activation of eNOS and MAP kinase occurs through a membrane-associated ER (9Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 12Russell K. Haynes M. Sinha D. Clerisme E. Bender J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5930-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The EC line EAhy.926 used in these experiments exhibits rapid E2-induced signaling but is unable to stimulate ER-dependent gene transactivation. Additionally, EAhy.926 cells do not express the traditional 66-kDa ERα or ERβ but express a 46-kDa protein immunoreactive with C-terminal ER antibodies. Recently, a protein of similar size reactive with E2 and anti-ER antibodies was found to be associated with the plasma membrane in MCF-7 cells (13Marquez D.C. Pietras R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5420-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Mineo C. Liu P. German Z. Sherman T.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Anderson R.G. Shaul P.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E44-E52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, a 46-kDa putative ER, reactive with anti-ER antibodies, was found in wild-type and in the initial ERα knockout mice. This form of the receptor was thought to be responsible for E2 enhancement of basal NO production in the initial ERα knockout mice, because this E2 effect was lost in the complete ERα knockout mouse (15Pendaries C. Darblade B. Rochaix P. Krust A. Chambon P. Korach K.S. Bayard F. Arnal J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2205-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In human ECs expressing both the 66- and the 46-kDa receptor, both rapid signaling to MAP kinase and gene transactivation of estrogen-responsive element-luciferase reporter was stimulated with E2 treatment (12Russell K. Haynes M. Sinha D. Clerisme E. Bender J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5930-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). As previously indicated, the specific mechanism of membrane-associated ER coupling to P85 is unknown. E2-mediated actions are sensitive to serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase inhibition. Previously, the activation of the tyrosine kinase c-Src was associated with rapid E2 effects in breast cancer cells (16Migliaccio A., Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 17Migliaccio A. Pagano M. Auricchio F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2183-2191PubMed Google Scholar). Src activation induces MAP kinase through a Shc/Grb2/Ras signaling cascade. In addition to MAP kinase, Ras-GTP has been shown to bind and activate PI3-kinase. Because E2 rapidly activates both EC MAP kinase and PI3-kinase, we investigated the ability of E2 to activate Src kinase in human EC and whether the consequences of this activation include activation of PI3-kinase, Akt, eNOS, and MAP kinase. Here, we present evidence that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src, is rapidly activated in EC upon stimulation by E2. This activation leads to formation of a functional signaling complex composed of ER, c-Src, and P85. E2 and ionomycin were purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions were prepared in ethanol with final ethanol concentrations less than 0.1%.

Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were isolated and maintained as described previously (5Caulin-Glaser T. Garcia-Cardena G. Sarrel P. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ.

Murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from embryos deficient in c-Src, yes, and fyn (SYF−/−) or fibroblasts derived from control animals lacking both yes and fyn but maintaining normal levels of c-Src (YF−/−S+/+), described previously (19Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), were maintained in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum. Before E2 stimulation, cells were cultured in E2-free medium consisting of phenol red-free DMEM and 10% gelding horse serum and were subsequently serum-starved in phenol red-free DMEM containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. EC monolayer NO release was quantified by NO-specific chemiluminescence using potassium iodide and acetic acid reflux, as described previously (8Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y.

Cells were stimulated with E2 and ionomycin for 30 min at 37 °C, and supernatants were collected for NO analysis. The Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, or vehicle was added 30 min before agonist stimulation and NO collection. Cell monolayers were stimulated as described in the figure legends. Cells were either lysed directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer or in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaPiPO4, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were either directly subjected to SDS-PAGE or first incubated with the appropriate primary antibody, immunoprecipitated with protein A/G agarose (Santa Cruz) subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoblots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled species-specific secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. The PI3-kinase assay was performed essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, monolayers of EAhy.926 cells were E2-deprived for 48 h and serum-starved in 0.25% bovine serum albumin overnight before E2-stimulation. Some plates were additionally preincubated with inhibitors or vehicle control before stimulation. Cells were washed and lysed in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm NaF. The supernatant was collected and precleared by irrelevant mouse IgG. Approximately 500 μg of soluble proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-P85 or anti-ERα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were harvested by protein A/G agarose, washed, and incubated with 15 μg of phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc) for 10 min at room temperature.

The reaction was terminated by 6N HCl, after which the lipids were extracted by chloroform/methanol (1:1) and fractionated by thin layer chromatography in chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (129:114:21:5). The thin layer chromatography plate was then air-dried and subjected to autoradiography. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing β-galactosidase (β-gal), or the membrane-targeted, myristoylated Akt (myr-Akt), described previously (8Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar), were obtained from K. Walsh (St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, Boston, MA). Monolayers were incubated with the recombinant adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for β-gal and myr-Akt. After infection, E2-free medium was added for the cell recovery period followed by serum starvation in phenol red-free DMEM plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Adenovirally infected cells were stimulated as described in the figure legends. Cell monolayers were incubated with empty vector (pcDNA3), kinase dead Src kinase (Src K295M), or constitutively active Src kinase (Src Y527F) and Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a 1:6 DNA-to-lipid ratio according to the manufacturer's directions in E2-free medium. After transfection, cells were serum-starved in phenol red-free DMEM and 0.1% bovine serum albumin before stimulation with E2. We demonstrated previously that induced NO release occurs through activation of E2-stimulated PI3-kinase and Akt activation, resulting in phosphorylation and enhanced activation of eNOS (9Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Once Akt is targeted to the membrane via a PI3-kinase-dependent mechanism, it can be phosphorylated on at least two residues, Ser473 and Thr308. Phosphorylation of Thr308 is thought to be largely constitutive, whereas Ser473 phosphorylation is highly inducible. Thus “activation” of Akt is almost exclusively measured by Ser473 phosphorylation (20Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Recently, in addition to phosphorylation of Ser473 and Thr308, Akt has been shown to be phosphorylated on Tyr315 and Tyr326 by Src kinase (21Chen R. Kim O. Yang J. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J. Chen H. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31858-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This tyrosine phosphorylation is thought to be important for full activation of Akt but is independent of serine/threonine phosphorylation. These authors demonstrated that the activity of a constitutively active Akt (myr-Akt) was further augmented by transfection of a constitutively active Src kinase (Src527F). Therefore, we attempted to determine whether Src kinase was a primary upstream mediator of the signal transduction pathway leading to E2-mediated NO release. EC were pretreated with PP2, a pharmacological inhibitor specific for Src family tyrosine kinases (22Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28371-28378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), or vehicle for 30 min before agonist stimulation and NO collection. As in our prior work, the EAhy.926 EC line was used, largely because the cells are phenotypically homogeneous, contain good levels of eNOS, and display rapid signaling responses to estrogen (9Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar,12Russell K. Haynes M. Sinha D. Clerisme E. Bender J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5930-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). PP2 completely abrogated E2-induced NO release but had no effect on ionomycin-stimulated NO release (Fig. 1). This demonstrates that a member of the Src kinase family is involved in E2- but not calcium ionophore-enhanced eNOS activation. To begin dissecting the level at which Src kinase transduces the aforementioned E2-stimulated responses, EAhy.926 cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding either β-gal as a control or a membrane targeted and thus constitutively active myr-Akt. After infection, the cells were pretreated with PP2, followed by E2 or vehicle stimulation for 30 min, and the NO release was quantified. PP2 has no effect on NO release induced by constitutively active Akt (Fig. 2), indicating that Akt itself is not a critical substrate for Src kinase. That is, Src kinase-mediated Akt tyrosine phosphorylation is not a required step in Akt-dependent eNOS activation. This demonstrates that a Src kinase is playing a role upstream of Akt-mediated eNOS phosphorylation. Because PP2 was unable to prevent NO release induced by constitutively active Akt, it was important to determine where in the pathway Src kinase was involved. PP2 abrogates E2-induced phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473 in immortalized EAhy.926 EC (Fig. 3 A) and in HUVEC (Fig. 3 B), indicating Src kinase involvement in the primary activation of Akt (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation of a downstream target of E2-activated Akt, eNOS Ser1177, was inhibited by pretreatment of HUVEC with PP2 (Fig. 3 C), correlating with PP2 inhibition of E2-stimulated NO release (Fig. 1). These data also indicate that the E2-induced signaling responses seen in the immortalized EAhy.926 cells are functionally identical to that seen in primary HUVEC.Figure 3Effect of PP2 on induced Akt and eNOS phosphorylation. EC (EAhy.926 (A) and HUVEC (B)) were pretreated with PP2 (10 μm) or vehicle for 20 min, followed by E2 (10 ng/ml) activation for 15 min.

Biochem. 1999; 76: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In these cells, Src kinase activation results in the induction of the Shc/Ras/Erk signal transduction pathway. We have previously demonstrated rapid EC Erk1/2 activation in response to E2 (12Russell K. Haynes M. Sinha D. Clerisme E. Bender J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5930-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Human EC, including EAhy.926 cells, contain easily detectable levels of c-Src. Therefore, E2-induced c-Src activation was evaluated. c-Src activation kinase requires carboxy-terminal Tyr530 dephosphorylation and subsequent kinase domain Tyr416 autophosphorylation (27Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A demonstrates induced c-Src Tyr416 phosphorylation within 2 min of E2 stimulation. As with all other E2-stimulated rapid signaling responses we have observed in human EC (5Caulin-Glaser T. Garcia-Cardena G. Sarrel P. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ.

PP2 also abrogates E2-induced c-Src phosphorylation, consistent with the requirement for autophosphorylation. However, E2-induced c-Src phosphorylation was not inhibited by the specific PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, indicating E2 activation of Src kinase occurs before activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. Although c-Src phosphorylation/activation is clearly E2-induced in EC (Fig. 4 A) and in osteoclasts (16Migliaccio A., Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F.

In osteoclasts, an interaction between ligand-activated steroid receptors and c-Src seems required for kinase activity (16Migliaccio A., Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E.

Western blots performed on coimmunoprecipitates from E2-stimulated EAhy.926 cells demonstrated a rapidly induced c-Src/ER association (Fig. 4 B). The anti-ER antibody used is a monoclonal antibody directed at the carboxyl terminus of ERα. In human EC, including EAhy.926, the antibody blots/immunoprecipitates a 46-kDa protein that we believe to be the predominate membrane-associated ER in these cells (Ref. 12Russell K. Haynes M. Sinha D. Clerisme E. Bender J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5930-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, and below). Thus, E2 stimulation promotes the formation of a putative signaling complex between the 46-kDa, signal-transducing ER and c-Src. As might be expected from our previous results, PP2 also inhibited E2- but not ionomycin-stimulated Erk1/2 activation (data not shown). These data support the idea that E2-induced c-Src activation results in parallel activation of the MAP kinase (Erk1/2) and Akt pathways, the latter of which results in eNOS phosphorylation and augmented NO release. We have previously demonstrated that E2-activated NO release can be completely inhibited by the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (9Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), indicating an absolute requirement for PI3-kinase. It was recently demonstrated that ERα can associate with the regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase, P85, and that this association correlates with increased production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphates (10Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ligand-induced ER/P85 association activates PI3-kinase remains to be determined. In EAhy.926 cells, which do not express the full-length ER, we thus evaluated whether this alternative form of ER could associate with P85. E2-treated cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ERα antibodies and Western blotted for the presence of P85. E2 rapidly stimulated ER/P85 association in EAhy.926 cells (Fig. 5 A). This association was blocked by the ER antagonist, ICI 182,780 and PP2, indicating a role for Src kinase in this complex formation (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, c-Src was inducibly associated with P85 in response to E2 (Fig. 5 C), an effect that was also inhibited by ICI 182,780 and PP2. Because PP2 treatment inhibited the apparent upstream ER/P85 association, as well as downstream Akt and eNOS activation, it was important to determine the effect of Src kinase inhibition on E2-induced PI3-kinase activity. EAhy.926 cells were pretreated with ICI 182,780, LY294002, PP2, or vehicle control for 30 min before E2 stimulation, after which PI3-kinase was immunoprecipitated from stimulated cells with anti-P85 (Fig. 6) or anti-ERα antibodies. The production of PI3-kinase generated D3-phosphoinositides (PIP) was determined by an in vitro kinase assay. Fig. 6 demonstrates that in P85 immunoprecipitates, E2 stimulation rapidly increased the production of PIP, with maximum levels achieved in 10 min. These increases in PIP were completely abrogated by ER antagonist ICI 182,780, LY294002, and PP2. Identical results were obtained when E2-induced PI3-kinase activity was immunoprecipitated with anti-ERα antibodies. E2-stimulated increased production of PIP in ER immunoprecipitates was also inhibited by pretreatment with ICI 182,780, LY294002 and PP2 (data not shown). This indicates that Src kinase is required for the E2-mediated increase in PI3-kinase activity and that Src is a component of the activated ER/PI3-kinase signaling complex. Notably, PI3-kinase inhibition with LY294002 did not inhibit E2 activation of Src kinase (Fig. 4 A), suggesting a sequential activation cascade in which ER/c-Src association induces Src kinase activity and the activated ER/c-Src complex consequently associates with P85, effecting increased PI3-kinase ac"

In the central nervous system, DAT mediates the re-uptake of released dopamine (DA) from the synaptic cleft back into the nerve terminal for subsequent storage and release. Pharmacological and genetic studies highlight the DAT-mediated re-uptake process as the main mechanism for the termination of dopamine neurotransmission (1Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). In addition, DAT represents the main target site for commonly abused drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine as well as some therapeutic agents used in the management of affective disorders (2Amara S.G. Sonders M.S. Drug Alcohol Depend. 1998; 51: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of their deduced amino acid sequence reveals that Na+/Cl−-dependent plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters are proteins containing twelve transmembrane domains (TMs) with both the amino and the carboxyl termini located on the intracellular side of the membrane. This topological arrangement has been confirmed for several members of the family, including DAT (3Hersch S.M., Yi, H. Heilman C.J. Edwards R.H. Levey A.I. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 388: 211-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Since the molecular cloning of this transporter gene family, a great deal of information has been accumulated concerning the relationship between the structure and function of this class of proteins (4Chen N. Reith M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 405: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Studies using mutagenesis and heterologous expression systems have identified several amino acid residues and domains involved in substrate and inhibitor binding. Moreover, there is growing evidence suggesting that the subcellular distribution of monoamine transporters is regulated by second messenger systems (5Zahniser N.R. Doole S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 21-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Activation of protein kinase C in cells expressing DAT, SERT, or NET results in decreased transporter activity (6Huff R.A. Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 7Apparsundaram S. Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Hartzell H.C. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This effect is believed to result from a rapid redistribution of transporter proteins from the cell surface to intracellular compartments (9Melikian H.E. Buckley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7699-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In the case of DAT, there is also evidence indicating that substrates and inhibitors appear to regulate the cellular distribution of this transporter (11Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merril G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6850-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 12Little K.Y. Elmer L.W. Zhong H. Scheys J.O. Zhang L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Despite the increasing numbers of studies reporting DAT function and regulation, much less information is available regarding the mechanisms involved in the cellular processing of this transporter. Recent biochemical evidence suggests that neurotransmitter transporters exist as oligomeric complexes in cells, but the relevance of this process to transporter function as well as the molecular determinants involved in transporter assembly are unclear. Oligomers of SERT have been detected by co-immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged monomers (13Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis has also provided evidence for the oligomerization of GABA transporters (14Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, electrophysiological and freeze fracture electron microscopic studies revealed a pentameric structure for the unrelated neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3 in the plasma membrane ofXenopus oocytes (15Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8641-8646Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). More recently, Hastrup et al. (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) in an elegant series of experiments, demonstrated that the human DAT could be cross-linked as a homodimer at the plasma membrane of HEK-293 cells and provided evidence for a role of TM6 as an oligomerization domain (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The only exception to the transporter oligomerization rule so far appears to be the glycine transporter (GlyT), another member of the Na+/Cl−-dependent transporter family. Biochemical analysis of the size of GlyT expressed inXenopus oocytes is not consistent with an oligomeric structure for this transporter protein (17Horiuchi M. Nicke A. Gomeza J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This seemingly contradictory finding suggest that oligomerization might not be a common feature in transporter biology, or alternatively it is possible that biochemical approaches used to study oligomerization might disrupt the protein-protein interactions required to maintain oligomeric complexes. In any case, these results point out to the need for functional approaches to establish the oligomeric nature of a given transporter complex and its functional relevance. Given the importance of DAT in normal and abnormal brain function, it becomes important to understand how these proteins are regulated at the cellular level. In this report, we used mutational analysis combined with biochemical, immunological, and functional approaches to examine the assembly and trafficking properties of the human DAT expressed in mammalian cells. [3H]DA (31.6 Ci/mmol) was supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Taq polymerase was from Fisher Scientific, restriction enzymes were from Takara Biomedicals, and DNA purification kits were from Qiagen. The rat anti-DAT and rabbit anti-DAT antibodies were from Chemicon, anti-HA antibody was from Roche, and the anti-His antibody was from Sigma. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP, FITC, or Texas Red were from Jackson Immunoresearch. Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and ultralink avidin beads were from Pierce. The full-length cDNA encoding the human DAT was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). PCR-based mutagenesis (36 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min) was used to incorporate the His6 (HHHHHH) or the HA (YPYDVPDYA) epitopes into the amino terminus of DAT. Mutations in the coding region of DAT including Y335A, D79G, and the substitution of leucine residues from TM2 or TM9 to alanine residues were performed by site-directed mutagenesis combined with overlapping PCR. Amino-terminal deletions of DAT were generated by introducing initiator methionine residues at amino acid positions 11, 20, 48, and 60. Carboxyl-terminal transporter truncations were created by introducing stop codons in the coding region of DAT at amino acid positions 611, 601, 591, 582, 293, and 141. Asparagine residues from N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences were replaced by glutamine residues by site-directed mutagenesis. After PCR mutagenesis, restriction fragments containing mutated sequences were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, subcloned into pcDNA3.1 and verified by automated sequencing. HEK-293 cells were grown to 60–80% confluency in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and transiently transfected using the Ca2PO4 precipitation method with 5 μg of total DNA. Cells were incubated with the Ca2PO4-DNA mixture at 37 °C for 16 h, followed by 48 h recovery in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 units/ml of gentamycin. Subsequent experiments were performed 48–72 h after transfections. The conditions for dopamine uptake in HEK-293 cells have been adopted from Giros et al. (18Giros B. el Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 48–72 h after transfections, medium was removed, and uptake was measured following incubation of cells for 5 min with 250 μl of uptake buffer (in mm: 5 Tris base, 7.5 HEPES, 120 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 1 ascorbic acid, and 5 glucose, pH 7.4) containing 20 nm[3H]DA (31.6 Ci/mmol) and increasing concentrations of cold DA ranging from 100 nm to 30 μm. After rinsing with 1 ml of NaCl-free uptake buffer, cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1% SDS, and the radioactivity incorporated into the cells was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 2 μm mazindol or 10 μm cocaine. The protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. For assessment of whole cell DAT levels, transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were grown in 150-mm dishes. The medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were lysed at 4 °C for 20 min with 2 mm HEPES and 1 mmEDTA buffer and then scraped and centrifuged at 31,000 ×g for 20 min. The resultant pellet was homogenized in binding buffer (0.25 m sucrose and 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) using a polytron homogenizer. For saturation experiments, ∼100 μg of protein aliquots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 4 nm[3H]CFT (83.9 Ci/mmol) and increasing concentrations of cocaine ranging from 1 nm to 100 μm. The reaction was terminated by filtering the samples through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters with a Brandel cell harvester. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 2 μm mazindol. The protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Data are presented as means ± S.E. For immunostaining experiments, transiently transfected HEK-293 cells grown on glass coverslips were placed in 6-well dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well, followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. After three washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and incubated in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 5% goat serum in PBS) for 1 h. Cells were incubated with rat anti-DAT (1:1000) or a rabbit anti-DAT (1:1000) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with Texas red-conjugated anti-rat or FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Cells were then washed three times in PBS, and the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescent images were generated using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope at 585 nm for Texas Red and 488 nm for FITC. Transiently transfected monolayers of HEK-293 cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with gentle agitation for 30 min at 4 °C with 1 ml of 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin prepared in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8. The reaction was quenched by incubating the cells for an additional 10 min with 50 mm glycine in PBS. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA) (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 1 h. Each sample was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used for isolation of biotinylated proteins with ultralink-immobilized neutravidin beads. The second aliquot was used to determine total DAT levels. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting with the rat anti-DAT antibody and an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. HEK-293 cells expressing His6-DAT with or without HA-DAT were lysed in PBS containing 1% digitonin for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were run through a nickel column (Qiagen), fractionated on 10% acrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was performed using anti-HA or anti-His antibodies, secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP, and immunoreactive bands were detected with the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences). As a first step to understand the cellular regulation of the human DAT, we investigated whether DAT proteins could form oligomeric complexes in intact cells. DAT proteins were differentially tagged with either the His6 (His6-DAT) or the HA (HA-DAT) epitopes and assayed for protein-protein interaction by a nickel-based purification assay in transfected HEK-293 cells. To ensure that these epitope-tagged transporter molecules retained their structural and functional integrity, uptake assays were first performed in HEK-293 cells transfected with the individual constructs. As seen in Fig. 1 A the tagged transporters were functional and displayed kinetic and pharmacological properties similar to the wild-type transporter. Purification of His6-DAT on nickel columns under non-denaturing conditions allowed the detection of HA-DAT when both proteins are expressed simultaneously in the same cell, demonstrating that DAT proteins form tight complexes in living cells (Fig. 1 B, third lane). No interaction was detected when lysates from cells expressing individual constructs were mixed prior to purification on nickel columns (Fig. 1 B, second lane) indicating that the interaction occurs only when both tagged proteins are co-expressed in the same cell and is not promoted during protein solubilization. A physical interaction between DAT proteins strongly suggest the formation of an oligomeric complex. To provide direct functional evidence for DAT oligomerization, we reasoned that mutant transporter molecules devoid of uptake activity might still associate with the wild-type DAT and confer a dominant-negative effect on wild-type transporter function when co-expressed in cells. In searching for critical amino acids involved in transporter function and expression, we identified several residues that when mutated produced transporter proteins that exhibited little or no uptake activity. One of these residues, a tyrosine at amino acid position 335 located on the third intracellular loop between TMs 6 and 7, is conserved in all members of the Na+/Cl− transporter family and forms part of a putative consensus sequence for tyrosine-based internalization motif (19Collawn J.F. Lai A. Domingo D. Fitch M. Hatton S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21686-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We replaced this residue to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis and examined transporter activity in HEK-293 cells. When expressed in cells, the DATY335A mutant does not exhibit detectable uptake activity (Fig. 2 A), despite the fact that the protein is properly targeted to the cell membrane as evidenced by cell surface biotinylation experiments (Fig. 2 B) and confocal microscopy images of immunostained transfected cells (Fig. 2 C). Recently, Loland et al. (20Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have also shown that the Y335A mutation in DAT results in a transporter protein exhibiting less than 1% of uptake activity. In addition, these authors provide evidence suggesting that this tyrosine is critical in mediating conformational changes in DAT during activation-inactivation steps. To test the possibility that this non-functional mutant might exhibit a dominant-negative effect, mutant and wild-type transporters were co-expressed in cells, and uptake activity was assayed. Co-expression of DATY335A with wild-type DAT results in a significant reduction of [3H]DA uptake as compared with that observed in cells expressing wild-type DAT alone (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, no decrease in uptake activity of the wild-type DAT was observed when co-expressed either with an empty vector or with the unrelated β2-adrenegic receptor protein (Fig. 3 C). The reduction of wild-type DAT activity upon DATY335A co-expression was not due to a decrease in the total expression levels of the wild-type DAT or the amount of the wild-type transporter expressed at the cell membrane as revealed by biotinylation of cell surface proteins using the HA-tagged transporter (Fig. 3 B). Kinetic analysis revealed an approximate 60% decrease in V maxwith a small alteration in K m (2.2 μmin cells expressing wild-type DAT versus 3.6 μm in cells co-expressing wild-type DAT and Y335A). Thus, these findings provide evidence for the formation of an oligomeric complex between wild-type DAT and mutant Y335A transporter proteins at the cell membrane. In the second mutant examined, an aspartate residue at position 79 in the first TM of DAT was replaced with glycine (D79G). This residue is conserved only in monoamine transporters, whereas in the rest of the members of the Na+/Cl−-dependent transporter family, this position is occupied by a glycine residue. When expressed in HEK-293 cells, the D79G mutant did not exhibit detectable uptake activity (Fig. 4 A). Preliminary studies suggest that Asp-79 in DAT is critical in determining substrate selectivity. 2G. Torres, unpublished results. Cell surface biotinylation and immunostaining revealed that the mutant protein was efficiently delivered to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 A,inset). Thus, as in the case of the Y335A mutant, D79G lacks intrinsic transport activity. We then explored the possibility that the D79G mutant might exhibit dominant-negative effect when co-expressed with the wild-type transporter. As shown in Fig. 4 B, at a constant level of wild-type DAT, co-expression of D79G caused a significant reduction of [3H]DA uptake. The dominant-negative effect exhibited by the mutated transporter occurs when both wild-type and mutated DAT are co-expressed at the cell membrane. Thus, these results provide another example of a transporter complex at the cell membrane formed by a functional and a non-functional transporter. Next, we sought to determine which domains are involved in transporter oligomerization. We first turned our attention to the intracellular carboxyl-terminal of DAT. This domain has been shown to interact with intracellular proteins such as PICK1 and synuclein (21Lee F.J. Liu F. Pristupa Z.B. Niznik H.B. Faseb J. 2001; 15: 916-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar,22Torres G.E. Yao W.D. Mohn A.R. Quan H. Kim K.M. Levey A.I. Staudinger J. Caron M.G. Neuron. 2001; 30: 121-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and thus represent a candidate domain for monomer-monomer interaction. We made a series of deletions in the carboxyl-terminus of DAT at amino acid positions 611, 601, 591, and 582 (designated S582* through Q611*, Fig. 5 A) by introducing stop codons at the respective positions. All carboxyl-terminal-truncated proteins expressed well in HEK-293 cells and gave proteins of the appropriate molecular size (data not shown). Uptake experiments from HEK-293 cells expressing each of these mutants revealed that progressive deletions of the carboxyl terminus of DAT (Q611*, R601*, and L591*) produced a progressive decrease in transport activity (Fig. 5 B). L591* exhibited less than 1% of wild-type uptake function. A further deletion in the tail of DAT (S582*) completely abolished transporter function (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that S582* lacks transport activity and/or is not expressed at the plasma membrane. Confocal microscopy analysis of transfected cells stained with the anti-DAT antibody demonstrate that the lack of function of S582* is due to the impaired targeting of this mutant to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 C). To examine the possibility that the S582* mutant might inhibit the function of the wild-type DAT, we expressed both constructs simultaneously in HEK-293 cells and measured uptake activity. No detectable uptake activity was observed in cells expressing the S582* mutant (Fig. 6 A). However, the uptake activity of DAT is decreased in the presence of the S582* mutant as compared with that of DAT alone. Under conditions in which the whole cell levels of wild-type DAT remains constant, there is a dramatic decrease in the amount of cell surface wild-type DAT when co-expressed with S582* (Fig. 6 B, inset). Thus, the decreased uptake of the wild-type DAT when co-expressed with the deletion mutant was apparently due to a physical trapping of the wild-type and mutant DAT proteins in the cytoplasm. We further explored this possibility by examining the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutant transporters when expressed individually or in combination in HEK-293 cells. The wild-type transporter was tagged with GFP at the amino terminus whereas the deletion mutant was tagged with the HA epitope also at the amino terminus. This strategy allows for the differential visualization of wild-type and mutant proteins when co-expressed in the same cell. When expressed alone, the HA-tagged truncated transporter showed an intracellular staining pattern contrasting the clear plasma membrane distribution observed in cells expressing the wild-type GFP-tagged transporter (Fig. 6 C, upper panels). When wild-type and mutant transporters were co-expressed, the distribution of the wild-type transporter changed dramatically. Immunofluorescent experiments demonstrate that wild-type DAT colocalizes with the mutant transporter intracellularly (Fig. 6 C, middle panels). As a control, we co-transfected the GFP-tagged α1B-adrenergic receptor along with the S582* mutant transporter. As shown in Fig. 6 C (lower panels) the membrane localization of the receptor is not altered in the presence of the deletion mutant demonstrating that the mutant transporter does not cause a general nonspecific effect on protein processing. Taken together, our results indicate that the intracellular tail of the transporter is essential for the trafficking of this protein to the plasma membrane, and the inhibitory effect of the truncated transporter on wild-type DAT function results from the formation of oligomeric complexes unable to undergo normal processing to the cell surface. Because the truncated mutant is still able to associate with the wild-type transporter, these findings also suggest that the intracellular tail of DAT does not appear to be essential for DAT oligomerization. Amino-terminal deletions of DAT were generated to examine the role of this domain in the functional expression of the transporter. We created DAT deletion mutants lacking the first 10, 20, 48, and 60 amino acids (designated Δ10, Δ20, Δ48, and Δ60, respectively). In each case an initial methionine was engineered into the truncated sequence to ensure correct translation. When expressed in HEK-293 cells Δ10, Δ20, and Δ48 displayed transport activity similar to the wild-type transporter. In all cases onlyV max was reduced whereas K mvalues were not significantly altered (K m values in μm; wild-type DAT, 2.6 ± 0.7; Δ10, 2.8 ± 0.6; Δ20, 2.1 ± 0.5; and Δ48, 1.91 ± 0.6,n = 4). In contrast, cells expressing the Δ60 transporter mutant did not show any detectable uptake activity (Fig. 7 A). Immunofluorescent analysis with an anti-DAT antibody against the second extracellular loop of DAT, revealed an intracellular distribution of the Δ60 deletion mutant in transfected HEK-293 cells when compared with cells expressing the wild-type DAT (Fig. 7 B). These results demonstrate that the lack of transport displayed by the Δ60 mutant is due to the improper processing and/or sorting of this protein leading to the absence of transporter molecules on the plasma membrane. Next, we examined the ability of the amino-terminal deletion Δ60 mutant to co-associate with the full-length transporter by testing for dominant-negative effect when co-expressed in HEK-293 cells. Similar to the dominant-negative effect showed by the S582* mutant, the Δ60 mutant caused a significant reduction of wild-type transport activity (Fig. 7 C). Immunostaining of cells transfected with the GFP-DAT in the presence of the Δ60 mutant revealed an increase in the intracellular distribution of the full-length transporter when compared with cells expressing the GFP-tagged DAT alone (Fig. 7 D). Hence, the dominant-negative effect of Δ60 on the wild-type transporter results as a consequence of the association of mutant and wild-type transporters inside the cells. These results also rule out the involvement of the amino terminus of DAT as an essential domain in oligomerization. We next investigated the role of two leucine zipper-like motifs present within the second and the ninth TMs of DAT. This class of motif, which consists of four leucine residues periodically spaced by six amino acids and arranged in an α helix-like structure, was originally described in DNA-binding proteins and believed to mediate protein-protein interactions (23Albert T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we replaced the three leucine residues and one methionine from TM2 at amino acid positions 99, 106, 113, and 120 by alanine residues (TM24LA). Cells expressing this mutant transporter did not exhibit detectable uptake activity (Fig. 8 A) despite the fact that the protein was synthesized at similar levels compared with the wild-type transporter (Fig. 8 B). Interestingly, the size of this mutated transporter was much smaller than the size of the"

Although this type of regulation is considered the paradigm for NF-κB activation, other regulatory profiles are known to exist. By far the most common of these is chronic or persistent activation of NF-κB. In comparison, regulation of NF-κB in a biphasic manner represents a profile that is scarcely documented and whose biological significance remains poorly understood. Here we show using differentiated skeletal muscle cells, that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces NF-κB activation in a biphasic manner. Unlike the first transient phase, which is terminated within 1 h of cytokine addition, the second phase persists for an additional 24–36 h. Biphasic activation is mediated at both the levels of NF-κB DNA binding and transactivation function, and both phases are dependent on the IKK/26 S proteasome pathway. We find that regulation of the first transient phase is mediated by the degradation and subsequent resynthesis of IκBα, as well as by a TNF-induced expression of A20. Second phase activity correlates with persistent down-regulation of both IκBα and IκBβ proteins, derived from a continuous TNF signal. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of NF-κB prior to initiation of the second phase of activity inhibits cytokine-mediated loss of muscle proteins. We propose that the biphasic activation of NF-κB in response to TNF may play a key regulatory role in skeletal muscle wasting associated with cachexia.

In mammalian cells this family consist of RelA/p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50 (p105 precursor) and p52 (p100 precursor). These proteins are distinguished by a REL homology domain contained in the amino terminus, which specify protein dimerization, DNA binding, and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) (1Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Imm. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). This family can be further subdivided into proteins that contain a transactivation domain at their carboxyl terminus (p65, c-Rel, and RelB) and those that do not (p50 and p52). Although in vitro, each of these proteins possesses the ability to homo- or heterodimerize, the prototypic form of NF-κB consists of the p50/p65 heterodimer. In most cells, the majority of NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm, bound to the IκB inhibitory protein family, which include IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, Bcl-3, p100, and p105. These proteins function as inhibitors through ankyrin repeats, which bind to the REL domain of NF-κB and mask the NLS site thus preventing NF-κB nuclear translocation (1Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Imm. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar).Activation of NF-κB is mediated through the IκB kinase complex (IKK), which functions to phosphorylate two serine residues on IκB proteins (4Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immun. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4045) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these residues causes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκB proteins by the 26 S proteasome complex (4Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immun. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4045) Google Scholar). Upon loss of IκB, NF-κB is free to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to its cognate DNA sequence and interacts with the basal transcription machinery and transcriptional co-activators to stimulate gene expression (5Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Parekh B. Yie J. Maniatis T. Thanos D. Cell. 2000; 103: 667-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). One of the numerous genes induced by NF-κB is its own inhibitor, IκBα (6Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 7Scott M.L. Fujita T. Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D.

A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Once resynthesized, usually within 1 h of NF-κB activation depending on the activating signal and cell type, IκBα is transported to the nucleus where it binds and inhibits NF-κB DNA binding (9Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. & Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB is sequestered back to the cytoplasm through a nuclear export signal located in the amino terminus of IκBα (10Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In this fashion, the rapid resynthesis of IκBα ensures the equally rapid turnover of NF-κB activity.NF-κB activation is stimulated by a wide variety of both intra- and extracellular stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines, viral and bacterial products, growth factors, and pro-oncogenic signals (12Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Among the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is one of the most potent activators of NF-κB in cell types possessing TNF receptors (13Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). TNF is produced primarily from macrophages and functions in the early phases of infection by activating and recruiting other immune cells through the production of chemokines and other proinflammatory cytokines (14Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. of Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Overproduction of TNF is also thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of several diseases including septic shock, cancer, AIDS, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis (14Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. of Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In cancer and AIDS, chronic production of TNF has been further linked to the degeneration of skeletal muscle associated with tissue wasting or cachexia (15Argiles J.M. Lopez-Soriano F.J. Med. Res. Rev. 1999; 19: 223-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Tisdale M.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar).Skeletal muscle wasting involves the proteolytic degradation of myofibrillar proteins as well as the inability to synthesize new muscle gene products (15Argiles J.M. Lopez-Soriano F.J. Med. Res. Rev. 1999; 19: 223-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Tisdale M.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In vitro, TNF has been shown to function as a potent inhibitor of skeletal myogenesis (17Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 18Langen R.C. Schols A.M. Kelders M.C. Wouters E.F. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Faseb J. 2001; 15: 1169-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This activity is mediated through NF-κB (17Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), which promotes the down-regulation of the myogenic bHLH transcription factor, MyoD (19Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Absence of MyoD is known to impair skeletal myogenesis (20Cornelison D.D. Olwin B.B. Rudnicki M.A. Wold B.J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 122-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and compromise the efficiency of muscle regeneration in response to injury (21Megeney L.A. Kablar B. Garrett K. Anderson J.E. Rudnicki M.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In contrast, TNF activity alone is not sufficient to cause full degradation of mature muscle (22Moldawer L.L. Svaninger G. Gelin J. Lundholm K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C766-C773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has prompted the notion that TNF functions in concert with other proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon γ (IFNγ) to induce wasting (16Tisdale M.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 23Spiegelman B.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 625-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Consistent with this thinking, recent evidence showed that the combined treatment of skeletal muscle with TNF and IFNγ induced strong down-regulation of muscle-specific gene products (17Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Importantly, cytokine-mediated muscle loss was prevented in myotubes lacking NF-κB activity, suggesting that this transcription factor may function as a critical regulator of skeletal muscle integrity.To gain greater insight on the role of NF-κB in cytokine-induced muscle wasting, the present study was undertaken to elucidate the regulation of NF-κB in response to TNF and IFNγ signaling in differentiated skeletal muscle. Since IFNγ has not been demonstrated on its own to activate NF-κB, our initial goal was to determine whether IFNγ signaling could synergize with TNF to activate NF-κB to a threshold level required for muscle decay. Utilizing differentiated C2C12 muscle cultures, results showed that IFNγ did not potentiate TNF-induced activation of NF-κB, suggesting that the synergistic action of TNF and IFNγ to induce muscle loss functions downstream from the initial point of NF-κB activation. However, in the course of this analysis, we observed that treatment of C2C12 myotubes with TNF alone caused a clear and pronounced biphasic activity of NF-κB. In contrast to the first phase, which was potent but transient, the activity of the second phase was equally potent but persisted, lasting an additional 24–36 h following TNF treatment. This type of NF-κB activity profile is unlike the classical scheme represented by a single transient phase. It also differs from the more commonly described chronic or persistent activity of NF-κB. Thus, in this study differentiated skeletal muscle cells were utilized to characterize the biphasic activation pattern of NF-κB in response to TNF, and to determine its biological significance with respect to cytokine-induced muscle wasting.DISCUSSIONThe basis of this study was founded on previous results showing that skeletal muscle protein loss depended on the combined signaling activities of inflammatory cytokines TNF and IFNγ (17Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Results also demonstrated that NF-κB activity was required for cytokines to induce muscle damage (17Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.-Y. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into how NF-κB potentially functions in cytokine-induced muscle wasting, we sought to first examine how these cytokines signal to NF-κB in differentiated muscle. Unlike the earlier described synergistic actions of TNF and IFNγ on NF-κB signaling in endothelial and neuronal cell types (28Cheshire J.L. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our current results demonstrate that addition of IFNγ does not potentiate TNF-induced activity of NF-κB. However, in the course of this analysis we discovered that in skeletal muscle, NF-κB activity was regulated in a biphasic manner by TNF. In contrast to the first phase of NF-κB activity, which was potent but transient, the second identified phase was nearly as potent, and it persisted out to nearly 2 days following initial TNF treatment. Importantly, two other known inducers of NF-κB, IL-1 or LPS, did not induce this biphasic activity, suggesting that this regulation on NF-κB may be specific to certain NF-κB inducing signals.Biochemical and genetic analyses have soundly established that NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor, where the majority is maintained as an inactive complex through the cytoplasmic retention by IκB inhibitors (1Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Imm. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 36Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwartz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells by a wide variety of signals leads to proteolytic degradation of IκB proteins, and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB. It has also been well accepted that activation of NF-κB, by most physiological inducing signals, is a transient response, reaching its peak usually within 30 min followed by a return to basal levels within 1–4 h. The transient nature of NF-κB activity is in part due to the resynthesis of IκBα (6Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 7Scott M.L. Fujita T. Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), which binds and exports NF-κB from the nucleus back to the cytoplasm (10Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Depending on the inducer and/or cell type, however, other activation profiles of NF-κB have been described. By far the most common of these profiles is the described persistent or constitutive activity of NF-κB that occurs when NF-κB activity does not return back to its basal state following its initial induction phase. Ghosh and co-workers (37Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had earlier described such a phenomenon in B cells treated with LPS. In these cells, the persistent activity of NF-κB was derived from its binding to a hypophosphorylated form of IκBβ, which protects NF-κB from IκBα binding and inactivation, thereby facilitating NF-κB nuclear import. A similar mechanism of protection by IκBβ was attributed to the persistent activity of NF-κB observed in myeloid cells infected with the HIV virus (38DeLuca C. Petropoulos L. Zmeureanu D. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13010-13016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms have been presented to account for such a persistent activity. For example, the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 protein, Tax, has been shown to bind and stimulate the IKK complex resulting in chronic NF-κB activity (39Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34060-34067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,40Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24445-24458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In mature B cells, evidence suggests that a calcium-mediated signaling pathway accounts for the chronic degradation of IκBα, leading to constitutively high levels of c-Rel activity (41Fields E.R. Seufzer B.J. Oltz E.M. Miyamoto S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4762-4767Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, continual loss of IκBβ has been attributed to the prolonged activation state of NF-κB in glial cells treated with IL-1 (42Bourke E. Kennedy E.J. Moynagh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39996-40002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, persistent activity of NF-κB is often associated with pathophysiological states such as cancer (12Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar).In contrast to these types of activation profiles, biphasic activity of NF-κB, as described in this report, is a type of regulatory profile less well described, and whose regulatory mechanisms and biological relevance remain poorly understood. With respect to TNF signaling, Han and Brasier (43Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) described such a phenomenon in cultured hepatocytes, in which the duration of the second phase of NF-κB activity was measured for 6 h correlating with the loss of IκBβ. Kemler and Fontana (44Kemler I. Fontana A. Glia. 1999; 26: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) also detected biphasic activity of NF-κB in glial and neuroblastoma cell lines for up to 4 h post-TNF treatment, and in this case activation was shown to result from the combined losses of both IκBα and IκBβ proteins. Similar biphasic activity has been described in response to other stimuli including viral infection (45Yurochko A.D. Kowalik T.F. Huong S.M. Huang E.S. J. Virology. 1995; 69: 5391-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and most recently, LPS signaling (46Han S.J., Ko, H.M. Choi J.H. Seo K.H. Lee H.S. Choi E.K. Choi I.W. Lee H.K. Im S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44715-44721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Given these results, in conjunction with our current data acquired in skeletal muscle, it would appear that the ability of NF-κB to undergo biphasic activation is not cell type- or stimuli-specific, nor is it restricted to a single regulatory mechanism. In addition, the recent citing that NF-κB undergoes biphasic activation in rat skeletal muscle in response to ischemia/reperfusion, suggest that biphasic regulation of NF-κB is relevant in this tissue in vivo (47Lille S.T. Lefler S.R. Mowlavi A. Suchy H. Boyle E.M., Jr. Farr A.L., Su, C.Y. Frank N. Mulligan D.C. Muscle Nerve. 2001; 24: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Unclear to this point however is the significance of this regulatory profile. Are the changes in NF-κB DNA binding activity reflected in its transcriptional activity, and what is the biological relevance of the second phase? At least in skeletal muscle, we have revealed that NF-κB is transcriptionally competent in both phases of its DNA binding activation profile. This was demonstrated by a reporter-based assay and also confirmed by analyzing the gene expression profiles of NF-κB responsive genes, IκBα and TNFα (Fig. 5 and data not shown, respectively). In regard to the biological relevance of the second phase, our data demonstrate that this may be associated with the strength and duration of activation. In skeletal muscle, the strength of activity of this second phase was seen to nearly match that of the first, and in sharp contrast to other cell types (43Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 44Kemler I. Fontana A. Glia. 1999; 26: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), remained active for nearly 48 h following cytokine treatment. Interestingly, this time coincides with the same period at which significant decreases of muscle specific proteins were detected in cytokine treated myotubes (Fig. 1). Data showing that the inhibition of NF-κB activity during this second phase blocked cytokine-mediated decreases in both MyoD and MHC would suggest that NF-κB biphasic activity is required for skeletal muscle decay. Although it has not yet been elucidated, it is likely that the second phase of NF-κB activity will be found to regulate multiple biological functions in various cell types.Use of the differentiated skeletal muscle cell system has revealed much regarding this biphasic activity of NF-κB in response to TNF signaling. Our results demonstrate that both activation phases are derived from independent nuclear translocation events, which contain NF-κB complexes that, as stated above, are transcriptionally competent. The results obtained in both C2C12 and primary skeletal myotubes also reveal that the subunit composition of NF-κB is seemingly identical during each activation phase. This indicates that following the termination of the first phase, where the p65 subunit is exported from the nucleus, a similar transcription factor complex is poised once again to be activated and undergo a second round of nuclear translocation. The data also argue that both activation phases were induced through the IKK/26 S proteasome signaling pathway. Collectively, these results portray a profile of NF-κB activity, which would appear to be defined by two identical regulatory mechanisms.Despite these similarities, our results revealed distinguishing features between each activation phase. The most obvious is the duration of NF-κB activity during each phase. While the first phase resembled a typical transient activation profile, where NF-κB activity is quickly terminated, the second phase persisted for nearly an additional 48 h. Our results using the IκBα-SR showed that the induction of the first phase is dependent on the rapid degradation of IκBα. The additional use of IκBα-null muscle cultures demonstrated that the termination of this first phase is also dependent on the resynthesis of IκBα within the first hour of TNF treatment. Although a similar analysis was not conducted with A20-null myotubes, our results support the notion that the observed rapid induction of A20 in response to TNF treatment functions in conjunction with IκBα to terminate the first phase of NF-κB. Termination of this phase most likely occurs both through the nuclear export of NF-κB by IκBα, as well as through the inhibition of TNF receptor signaling and IKK activation by A20. Results further demonstrated that induction of the first phase is a prerequisite for the second more persistent phase of NF-κB. In the presence of TNF, both IκBα and IκBβ proteins are persistently down-regulated. In addition, removal of TNF from myotube cultures (as shown in Fig. 8) caused the termination of this second phase and correlatively restored levels of IκB proteins. These results support the conclusion that regulation of both IκBα and IκBβ proteins define the duration of the second phase of NF-κB activity. However, results also indicated that down-regulation of IκBβ occurred even in the absence of the second phase of NF-κB activity (Fig. 7), bringing into question the essentialness of β degradation during this regulatory process. The development of an NF-κB transdominant inhibitor form of IκBβ (analogous to IκBα-SR) will be required to formally address the role of this IκB protein in the first and second phases of NF-κB. Another contributing factor regulating the second activation phase may be related to the expression of A20. Interestingly, in contrast to the biphasic expression pattern observed with an NF-κB responsive reporter and the IκBα gene, A20 expression was not found to be biphasic. In light of previous findings that absence of A20 in fibroblasts leads to chronic down-regulation of IκBα and persistent activity of NF-κB (48Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A. Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the persistent second phase of NF-κB activity results from the absence of A20 resynthesis.Despite these current findings, it remains unknown at this point how inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNF signal in skeletal myotubes to promote muscle loss. With respect to TNF signal transduction, we have elucidated that the biphasic activation of NF-κB is required in order for both TNF and IFNγ to mediate the loss of muscle specific gene products. Importantly, biphasic activation of NF-κB required that myotube cultures be continuously treated with exogenous TNF (Fig. 8). Elevated levels of TNF are often associated with chronic inflammatory conditions (14Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. of Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). This suggest that the biphasic regulation of NF-κB is likely to reflect a pathophysiological condition where TNF levels remain high in the circulation, as is often the case in cancer cachexia (15Argiles J.M. Lopez-Soriano F.J. Med. Res. Rev. 1999; 19: 223-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Our results also showed that IFNγ did not potentiate the ability of TNF to activate NF-κB (Fig. 2). This would imply that the synergism exhibited by these cytokines occurs as a result of independent activation of their respective downstream effectors such as NF-κB for TNF and STATs/IRFs for IFNγ (49Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). As seen in other instances (50Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5235-5244PubMed Google Scholar), these signaling molecules may converge further downstream, possibly on a common promoter to regulate the expression of a yet unidentified gene that may potentially be a critical regulator of skeletal muscle wasting associated in cancer-induced cachexia. Rel/NF-κB (NF-κB)1 is a dynamic transcription factor family involved in the regulation of innate immune response, cellular proliferation and differentiation, and cell survival (1Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Imm. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells this family consist of RelA/p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50 (p105 precursor) and p52 (p100 precursor). These proteins are distinguished by a REL homology domain contained in the amino terminus, which specify protein dimerization, DNA binding, and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) (1Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Imm. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). This family can be further subdivided into proteins that contain a transactivation domain at their carboxyl terminus (p65, c-Rel, and RelB) and those that do not (p50 and p52). Although in vitro, each of these proteins possesses the ability to homo- or heterodimerize, the prototypic form of NF-κB consists of the p50/p65 heterodimer. In most cells, the majority of NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm, bound to the IκB inhibitory protein fa"
https://openalex.org/W2006307429,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are crucial for visual and olfactory transductions1,2,3,4. These channels are tetramers and in their native forms are composed of A and B subunits5, with a stoichiometry thought to be 2A:2B (refs 6, 7). Here we report the identification of a leucine-zipper8-homology domain named CLZ (for carboxy-terminal leucine zipper). This domain is present in the distal C terminus of CNG channel A subunits but is absent from B subunits, and mediates an inter-subunit interaction. With cross-linking, non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and analytical centrifugation, this CLZ domain was found to mediate a trimeric interaction. In addition, a mutant cone CNG channel A subunit with its CLZ domain replaced by a generic trimeric leucine zipper produced channels that behaved much like the wild type, but less so if replaced by a dimeric or tetrameric leucine zipper. This A-subunit-only, trimeric interaction suggests that heteromeric CNG channels actually adopt a 3A:1B stoichiometry. Biochemical analysis of the purified bovine rod CNG channel confirmed this conclusion. This revised stoichiometry provides a new foundation for understanding the structure and function of the CNG channel family."

Here we report that the E3 ligase activity of the N-terminal 110 amino acid residues of BRCA1, which encodes a stable domain containing the RING finger, as well as that of the full-length BRCA1, was significantly enhanced by the BARD1 protein (residues 8–142), whose RING finger domain itself lacked Ub ligase activity in vitro.

Here we report that BARD1 can significantly enhance BRCA1 E3 Ub ligase activity by directly binding BRCA1, although BARD1 itself does not exhibit E3 ligase activity in vitro. BARD1 and BRCA1 form heterodimers in living cells and mutually control each other's abundance and stability. The enhancement of BRCA1 autoubiquitylation by BARD1 mostly results in poly-Ub chains linked through Lys63, which could be involved in pathways related to DNA damage response and repair rather than signaling BRCA1 degradation.

Based on the plasmid B230AE/pGEX, which contains WT GST-tagged N-terminal 8–142 aa of BARD1 (a gift from Dr. Richard Baer), plasmids pYN124 (C83G), pYN128 (C50G), pYN129 (R58A), pYN130 (I69A), pYN132 (H68A), pYN141 (H68A/C83G), pYN142 (C50G/H68A), pYN143 (C50G/C83G), pYN156 (L44R), and pYN158 (I105D) were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A DNA fragment containing the N-terminal 8–142 aa of BARD1 was PCR-amplified from B230AE/pGEX using primers (5′-GCCCACTAGTCCTCGAGGCCACGAAG-3′) and (5′-GAAATGCGGCCGCTCACGATGAATTCTTCTTG-3′) and cloned usingSpeI and NotI into pFLAG to generate pYN125. DNA fragment containing full-length BARD1 was PCR-amplified from BARD1-m1/pSP6 using primers (5′-GAAATGCGGCCGCTCAGCTGTCAAGAGGAAGC-3′) and (5′-GCCCACTAGTATGCCGGATAATCGGC-3′) and cloned usingSpeI and NotI into pFLAG to generate pYN147. Based on pYN147, pYN148 (C50G), pYN149 (R58A), pYN150 (H68A), pYN151 (I69A), pYN152 (C83G), pYN153 (C50G/C83G), pYN154 (C50G/H68A), pYN155 (H68A/C83G), pYN159 (L44R), and pYN161 (I105D) were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The plasmid expressing GST-BRCA1-(1–78) has been described previously (21Ruffner H. Joazeiro C.A. Hemmati D. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5134-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The plasmid pHIV CSC was constructed by introducing the cytomegalovirus promoter from pEGFP-C1 (Invitrogen) into the pHIV CS vector (36Miyoshi H. Blomer U. Takahashi M. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8150-8157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the full-length BRCA1 cDNA was introduced into the pHIV CSC vector from pBluescript 73.1, giving rise to pHIV CSC BRCA1. The baculovirus plasmid expressing full-length BRCA1 was generated by inserting BRCA1 cDNA into pAcSG2 (Pharmingen) with FLAG sequence tagged at the N terminus of BRCA1. GST-tagged and His-tagged proteins were expressed and purified as described by Leverson et al. (37Leverson J.D. Joazeiro C.A. Page A.M. Huang H. Hieter P. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2315-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). GST-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) by induction with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for about 3 h at 30 °C. The cell pellets were then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors). Proteins bound to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 20 mmglutathione (pH 7.1–7.5) and dialyzed against 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (38Leverson J.D. Ness S.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of WT or mutant GST-BARD1-(8–142) were mixed together with His-BRCA1-(1–110) on ice for 30 min, in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. The mixtures were then incubated with glutathione-agarose for another 30 min with rolling at 4 °C, and the beads were washed extensively with the same buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 20 mm glutathione (pH 7.1–7.5). His-tagged proteins were expressed as described above and purified by using Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech). Cells were lysed in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 μmZnSO4, and 1 mm imidazole) and bound to a 1-ml bed volume of Talon resin. After washing with 10 bed volumes of binding buffer plus 10 mm imidazole, the bound proteins were eluted with binding buffer plus 100 mm imidazole. Baculovirus FLAG-tagged full-length BRCA1 was generated and purified essentially as described (39Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified BRCA1 was ∼0.1 mg/ml and judged to be 95% pure as evidenced by a single Coomassie-stained band after resolution by Tris acetate 3–8% SDS-PAGE (Novex/Invitrogen). In vitroubiquitylation assays were carried out as previously described (40Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar), using purified bacterially expressed His-E1 and His-Ubc4. About 1 μg of purified GST-BRCA1-(1–110) was incubated with 50–500 nm His-E1, 0.5–5 μm His-Ubc4, 10 μm bovine ubiquitin or GST-Ub (WT or mutant), and 2 mm ATP in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). Purified GST-BARD1-(8–142) (WT or mutant) was added to the reactions as indicated. After a 90-min incubation at room temperature, reactions were stopped with 2 × SDS buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Ub monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-His5 monoclonal antibody (Qiagen), or affinity-purified anti-BRCA1 (A) polyclonal antibodies (41Ruffner H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Immunoblots to detect histone ubiquitylation were performed with a monoclonal anti-Ub antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and rabbit polyclonal anti-H2A, anti-H2B, anti-H3, and anti-H4 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology). 3 μg of Drosophilacore histones (a gift from Joaquin Espinosa and Beverly Emerson, Regulatory Biology Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies) and 0.25 μg of full-length FLAG-BRCA1 were added to each reaction in the absence or presence of 0.5 μg of GST-BARD1-(8–142). 293T human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. DNA transfections were carried out by a standard calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. In all of the transfections, the total amount of DNA was equalized. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were collected and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (6 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Trasylol, 50 mm NaF, and 100 μmNa3VO4), and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To examine the relative stability of BRCA1 and BARD1 proteins, fresh media containing cycloheximide (150 μg/ml final concentration) were added 48 h after transfection. The cells were collected at the times indicated, and cell lysates were subjected to ECL immunoblot analysis. The membranes were probed with anti-FLAG (Sigma) and anti-GST-Nck-α polyclonal antiserum from rabbit 5547. Transfection of full-length BRCA1 into 293T cells was carried out by the calcium phosphate BBS transfection method (42Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). After lysis, the samples were separated using Novex/Invitrogen 3–8% Tris-acetate SDS-PAGE gels and blotted according to the manufacturer's recommendation except for transfer times, which were extended to 90 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBST at a 1:1000 dilution for the anti-BRCA1 MS110 (Ab-1; Oncogene Science) and 1:5000 for anti-β-galactosidase (Novus Biologicals, Inc.) antibodies. The BRCA1 central RING motif, which encompasses residues 23–76 (15Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), is part of a larger proteolysis-resistant structural domain containing the first 110 residues of BRCA1 (43Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A plasmid expressing GST-BRCA1-(1–110) was constructed, and bacterially expressed protein was purified using glutathione beads. Purified GST-BRCA1-(1–110) was assayed for its ability to mediate the transfer of Ub and stimulate the synthesis of stable Ub conjugates in anin vitro ubiquitylation assay, using blotting with an anti-Ub monoclonal antibody to detect ubiquitylated products. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the BRCA1 RING domain exhibited E3 Ub ligase activity in an E1- and E2-dependent manner, consistent with previously published results (21Ruffner H. Joazeiro C.A. Hemmati D. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5134-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The polyubiquitylated conjugates include ubiquitylated BRCA1 and His-E1/E2 (data not shown). Purified His-BRCA1-(1–110) had E3 ligase activity similar to that obtained with GST-BRCA1-(1–110) (data not shown). Histone H2A could also be monoubiquitylated by GST-BRCA1-(1–110) (data not shown) and by full-length BRCA1 (Fig. 1 C, lane 7). The band was identified as monoubiquitylated H2A, based on its reactivity with both anti-H2A and anti-Ub antibodies. When the same membrane was probed with anti-H2B, anti-H3, and anti-H4 antibodies, no extra slower migrating bands were observed (data not shown), indicating that H2A is specifically monoubiquitylated by BRCA1 in vitro. To examine whether BARD1, which is itself a RING protein, might affect BRCA1 E3 Ub ligase activity, increasing amounts of purified GST-BARD1-(8–142) containing the RING domain (residues 49–100) were incubated together with GST-BRCA1-(1–110), His-E1, His-E2 (Ubc4), and GST-Ub. BARD1 significantly enhanced GST-BRCA1 E3 Ub ligase activity (Fig. 1 B), as had previously been reported in analogous studies by Hashizume et al. (22Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and Chen et al.(33Chen A. Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Ouchi T. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22085-22092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). His-BRCA1-(1–110) E3 ligase activity was also greatly stimulated by BARD1 (data not shown). The GST-BARD1-(8–142) protein lacked E3 ligase activity in vitro, even when present in the assay at much greater levels than BRCA1 (Fig. 1 D, lanes 6–10). As shown in Fig. 1 C, the monoubiquitylation of histone H2A by full-length BRCA1 was also much stronger in the presence of BARD1 (lanes 7 and9), consistent with the result from Pan's group (33Chen A. Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Ouchi T. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22085-22092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the presence of BARD1, several slowly migrating bands appeared when the membrane was probed with anti-Ub antibody, which could be polyubiquitylated products. However, when the same membrane was probed with anti-H2A antibodies, only one weak extra band migrating slower than monoubiquitylated H2A was observed (Fig. 1 C,lane 9). Therefore, we conclude that histone H2A was predominantly monoubiquitylated by BRCA1 in vitro in the presence of BARD1. To determine whether the enhancement of BRCA1 E3 Ub ligase activity by BARD1 depends on the integrity of the BARD1 RING domain and the interaction between the two proteins, the RING consensus residues Cys50, Cys83, and His68, in the BARD1 RING domain were mutated to Gly or Ala; the nonconserved Arg58 and Ile69 were also mutated to Ala (Fig. 2 A). The conserved Cys and His residues are necessary for the integrity of the BARD1 RING domain, which is in turn required for the proper orientation of the N- and C-terminal helices that form the four-helix bundle, and therefore these mutations might be expected to affect the interaction between BRCA1 and BARD1. The mutant GST-BARD1-(8–142) proteins were then purified and examined for their ability to bind BRCA1. GST protein and WT GST-BARD1-(8–142) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 B, WT GST-BARD1-(8–142) bound strongly to His-BRCA1-(1–110), whereas GST itself did not. The R58A and I69A mutant proteins bound equally well to BRCA1 when compared with WT BARD1. The C50G, H68A, and C83G single mutant proteins still bound to BRCA1 weakly, whereas the C50G/H68A, C50G/C83G, and H68A/C83G double mutant proteins only exhibited extremely low binding activity in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 2 B). To test the importance of the hydrophobic interactions in the four-helix bundle that stabilize the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer, we also constructed two BARD1 mutants with mutations in critical hydrophobic residues in the N- or C-terminal α-helix, L44R (N-terminal α-helix) and I105D (C-terminal α-helix), which contain an intact RING domain but fail to bind BRCA1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (15Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 44Morris J.R. Keep N.H. Solomon E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9382-9386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consistently, the L44R mutant protein showed no detectable binding, and the I105D mutant protein showed only extremely weak binding to BRCA1 in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 2 C). Next, equal amounts of purified WT or mutant BARD1 proteins were tested for their effects on BRCA1 E3 Ub ligase activity using GST-Ub, and ubiquitylated products were detected by blotting with anti-GST monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, WT GST-BARD1-(8–142) and the R58A and I69A mutant proteins significantly enhanced BRCA1 E3 Ub ligase activity (lanes 4, 6, and 8). The C50G, H68A, and C83G mutant proteins also enhanced BRCA1 E3 ligase activity, although relatively weakly (lanes 5, 7, and9). The I105D, C50G/H68A, and C50G/C83G mutant proteins had only very small stimulatory effects (lanes 12–14), and the L44R mutant protein had almost no detectable effect on BRCA1 E3 Ub ligase activity (Fig. 3,lane 11). In addition, the same amount of purified GST-BARD1-(8–142) had only an extremely weak stimulatory effect on the E3 ligase activity of GST-BRCA1-(1–78) (Fig. 3,lanes 15 and 16), which lacks the C-terminal α-helix (residues 81–96) flanking the central RING motif (15Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), consistent with the previous report that BARD1 does not interact stably with the N-terminal 71 residues of BRCA1 (23Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and the fact that this helix is critical for the four-helix bundle (15Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). These results indicate that a direct stable interaction between BARD1 and BRCA1 is required for BARD1 to enhance BRCA1 E3 Ub ligase activity and that the integrity of the BARD1 RING domain is not so important. To further investigate the molecular basis of BRCA1 and BARD1 cooperation, expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged human BRCA1 (full-length or N-terminal 308 amino acids) and FLAG-tagged WT or mutant human BARD1 (full-length or aa 8–142) were co-transfected into human 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the levels of FLAG-BRCA1-(1–308) protein were dramatically increased in the presence of increasing amounts of FLAG-tagged WT BARD1 (full-length or aa 8–142). To test the effect of BARD1 on full-length BRCA1, pHIV CSC BRCA1, which expresses full-length human BRCA1 in the third generation lentiviral vector, was co-transfected with FLAG-tagged BARD1 (full-length) expression plasmid or pBluescript II (KS+) (Stratagene) control plasmid. pCMX LacZ (45Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) and pEGFP C-2 (Clontech) were also co-transfected as controls for transfection efficiency. The level of transfected full-length BRCA1 protein was significantly elevated when full-length FLAG-BARD1 was co-expressed (Fig. 4 B). The endogenous BRCA1 protein level was also increased by transfected BARD1 (data not shown). Next, the effects of mutant BARD1 proteins on BRCA1 abundance were assessed. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the levels of FLAG-BRCA1-(1–308) protein were dramatically increased when full-length WT BARD1 or the R58A mutant was co-expressed (lanes 2, 4, and 13). In contrast, the C50G, H68A, and C83G single mutant proteins caused a relatively small increase in BRCA1 levels (lanes 3, 5, and 6), whereas the C50G/H68A, C50G/C83G, and H68A/C83G double mutant and L44R and I105D mutant proteins only had an extremely small stimulatory effect on BRCA1 abundance (Fig. 4 C, lanes 7–9,11, and 12).

Blocking of K+ channels inhibits the proliferation of many cell types, although the mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. There is speculation that K+channels differentially regulate the electrical potential of the plasma membrane (V m) during proliferation. We have demonstrated that in tumor cells the value of V m is clamped to rather depolarized values by K+ channels belonging to the HERG family. We report here that tumor cell lines preferentially express the herg1 gene and a truncated,N-deleted form that corresponds to herg1b. This alternative transcript is also expressed in human primary acute myeloid leukemias. Both HERG1 and HERG1B proteins are expressed on the plasma membrane of tumor cells and can form heterotetramers. The expression of HERG protein isoforms is strongly cell cycle-dependent, accounting for variations in HERG currents along the mitotic cycle. Moreover, the blocking of HERG channels dramatically impairs cell growth of HERG-bearing tumor cells. These results suggest that modulated expression of different K+ channels is the molecular basis of a novel mechanism regulating neoplastic cell proliferation.

Besides the regulation of excitability in nerve and muscle cells, and the linkage between plasma membrane and metabolic activity, there is now evidence that K+ channels are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation (1Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 91-107Google Scholar). The cellular mechanisms linking K+channel activity and cell proliferation remain unclear, although a possibility is that activation of K+ channels might be required for the passage of cells through a specific phase of the mitotic cycle (1Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 91-107Google Scholar, 2Wang S. Melkoumian Z. Woodfork K.A. Cather C. Davidson A.G. Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 456-464Google Scholar). K+ channel blockage has been shown to be antiproliferative for numerous non-excitable as well as excitable cells (3Xu B. Wilson B.A. Lu L. Am. J.

Physiol. 1998; 177: 402-410Google Scholar); however, the link between K+ channel activity and cell cycle progression remains elusive. One hypothesis is that K+ channels might regulate cell volume, as well as the concentration of intracellular solutes critical for cell metabolism; alternatively, K+ channel activity might serve to maintain permissive membrane potentials at critical cell cycle checkpoints (1Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 91-107Google Scholar). Furthermore, terminally differentiated G0 cells display a hyperpolarized value of their membrane potential (V m), whereas cycling and in particular tumor cells are quite depolarized (10Binggeli R. Weinstein R.C. J. Theor. Biol. 1986; 123: 377-401Google Scholar).We have shown previously (11Bianchi L. Wible B. Arcangeli A. Taglialatela M. Morra F. Castaldo P. Crociani O. Rosati B. Faravelli L. Olivotto M. Wanke E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 815-822Google Scholar) that the depolarized state of many tumor cell lines can be explained by the lack of classical inward rectifier K+ channel-type inward rectifier K+ currents accompanied by the expression of peculiar voltage-dependent K+ channels, belonging to the HERG1 family (12Arcangeli A.

Theherg (human eag-related) gene belongs to an evolutionarily conserved multigenic family of voltage-activated K+ channels, the eag (ether a-gò-gò) family (15Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl.

The functional properties of HERG channels are complex, and their contribution to the repolarization of the cardiac action potential well understood (16Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Google Scholar). For our purposes, however, it is sufficient to recall that the HERG activation and inactivation curves are such that their crossover produces maximal channel open probability between −30 and −50 mV in resting conditions (12Arcangeli A.

Olivotto M. Wanke E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 489: 455-471Google Scholar, 13Faravelli L. Arcangeli A. Olivotto M. Wanke E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 496: 13-23Google Scholar). In some neurons, the HERG role appears to be the regulation of the action potential firing frequency (17Chiesa N. Rosati B. Arcangeli A. Olivotto M. Wanke E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 313-318Google Scholar). Recent studies (18Arcangeli A. Rosati B. Cherubini A. Crociani O. Fontana L. Ziller C. Wanke E. Olivotto M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2596-2604Google Scholar) indicate that in various normal tissues other than heart and brain, IHERG and the erg gene are expressed only at very early stages of embryo development and are subsequently replaced by inward rectifier K+ channel currents.The molecular basis of IHERG is being uncovered. HERG channels are tetramers, with each subunit consisting of six transmembrane domains, and both N and C termini are located intracellularly. The HERG proteins compose the α subunit of the channel, whereas a β subunit associating with HERG is represented, at least in parts of the heart, by the MIRP1 protein (19Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Google Scholar). Three different ERG proteins have been cloned in mammals: ERG1, ERG2, and ERG3 (HERG1, HERG2, and HERG3 in humans), with the latter being specific to the nervous tissues (20Shi W. Wymore R.S. Wang H.S. Pan Z. Cohen I.S. McKinnon D. Dixon J.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9423-9432Google Scholar). The recently characterized genomic structure of the herg gene encoding the HERG1 protein (herg1gene) consists of 15 exons, spanning about 19 kb on chromosome 7 (21Curran M.K. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.K. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Google Scholar,22Itoh T. Tanaka T. Nagai R. Kamiya T. Sawayama T. Nakayama T. Tomoike H. Sakurada H. Yazaki Y. Nakamura Y. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 435-439Google Scholar). Most of the exons code for the N and C termini, which therefore appear to be putative sites for alternative splicing. The HERG1 C terminus contains the cyclic nucleotide binding domain (15Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Google Scholar), and an alternatively spliced product of this region (named HERGUSO) has been identified in the heart (23Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27231-27235Google Scholar), which cannot be expressed on the plasma membrane by itself but could modify the biophysical properties of IHERG. Conversely, the N terminus is made up of two domains, the “eag” domain, comprising the first 135 amino acids of the HERG1 sequence, and the “proximal” domain, which extends from position 135 to about position 366. The former domain, a eukaryotic PAS domain, is involved in the regulation of channel gating (24Wang J. Trudeau M.C. Zappia A.M. Robertson G.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 637-647Google Scholar, 25Cabral J.H.M. Lee A. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T., Li, M. McKinnon R. Cell. 1998; 95: 649-655Google Scholar, 26Viloria C.G. Barros F. Giraldez T. Gomez-Varela D. De La Pena P. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 231-246Google Scholar), particularly with regard to deactivation rates, whereas the latter is apparently involved in regulating channel activation. An alternative transcript of the herg1 gene, displaying a short N terminus, has been identified in mouse and human hearts, merg1b and herg1b, respectively (27London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Google Scholar, 28Lees-Miller J.P. Kondo C. Wang L. Duff H.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 719-726Google Scholar). Compared with merg1, merg1b has a different first exon (designated 1b) located between exons 5 and 6 of theMerg1 genomic sequence. Because the region upstream from exon 1b may contain an alternate transcription initiation site, it is possible that merg1b represents an alternate transcript more than a splicing variant (27London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Google Scholar, 28Lees-Miller J.P. Kondo C. Wang L. Duff H.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 719-726Google Scholar). However, recent evidence (29Pond A.L. Scheve B.K. Benedict A.T. Petrecca K. Van Wagoner D.R. Shrier A.S. Nerbonne J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5997-6006Google Scholar) seems to exclude the expression of this transcript at the protein level in the hearts of various species.We thus investigated the molecular structure of herg genes and HERG proteins in tumor cell lines. In particular, because IHERG biophysical features (rapid deactivation kinetics and strong dependence of the activation gate on depolarized values of theV m) as well as herg biomolecular characteristics (presence of multiple RNA bands ranging from 4.4 to 1.9 kDa as revealed in Northern blot experiments) in tumor cells are quite different from those displayed by the channel in the heart and inherg1-transfected cells (11Bianchi L. Wible B. Arcangeli A. Taglialatela M. Morra F. Castaldo P. Crociani O. Rosati B. Faravelli L. Olivotto M. Wanke E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 815-822Google Scholar, 30Schönnher R. Rosati B. Hehl S. Rao V.G. Arcangeli A. Olivotto M. Heinemann S. Wanke E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 753-760Google Scholar), the expression of different herg genes, as well as of alternate transcripts in tumor cells, was investigated.We report here that tumor cell lines, as well as primary human tumors, preferentially express the herg1 gene, along withherg1b. Both the full-length HERG1 and HERG1B proteins are coexpressed and can form heterotetramers on the plasma membrane of tumor cells. The expression of the two HERG protein isoforms turned out to be strongly cell cycle-dependent, suggesting a possible explanation for the variations in IHERG along the mitotic cycle previously demonstrated in neuroblastoma cells (12Arcangeli A. Bianchi L. Becchetti A. Faravelli L. Coronnello M. Mini E. Olivotto M. Wanke E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 489: 455-471Google Scholar). Moreover, the block of HERG channels dramatically impaired cell growth of HERG-bearing neuroblastoma cells.On the whole, these results contribute to an understanding of the molecular basis of a novel mechanism regulating neoplastic cell proliferation, i.e. HERG K+ channels.RESULTSExperiments performed were aimed at determining the molecular basis of HERG currents in tumor cells. The first point to be explored was whether cancer cells expressed different herg genes, namely herg1, herg2, or herg3. For this purpose, RPA experiments were performed using appropriately clonedherg1, -2, and -3 probes on tumor cell lines of different histogenesis: human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD12), human colon carcinoma (H630), human mammary carcinoma (SkBr3), and human monoblastic leukemia (FLG 29.1). The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1 A, all of the tumor cell lines tested express the herg1 gene, although at different intensities (see also the densitometric analysis reported in Fig. 3 a). In particular, both SH-SY5Y and FLG 29.1 cells appear to overexpress the herg1 gene, as suggested previously (11Bianchi L. Wible B. Arcangeli A. Taglialatela M. Morra F. Castaldo P. Crociani O. Rosati B. Faravelli L. Olivotto M. Wanke E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 815-822Google Scholar). On the other hand, no human tumor cell line expresses the herg2 gene (Fig. 1 B), except for the human retinoblastoma cell line Y-79. This expression, which represents the positive control in our experiments, is in keeping with the well known expression of erg2 gene in the retina, at least in rat (20Shi W. Wymore R.S. Wang H.S. Pan Z. Cohen I.S. McKinnon D. Dixon J.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9423-9432Google Scholar). As for herg3 expression (Fig. 1 C), only SkBr3 cells express the gene at good levels, as compared with human brain. Therefore, these cells express both herg3 andherg1, with the latter expressed at relatively low intensity.Figure 3Expression of the herg1N-terminal domain in tumor cell lines. The RNA samples were probed with the herg1 probe encompassing the first 135 amino acids of the N-terminal domain (herg1 N135) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Human cyclophilin (hcyc) (Ambion) was used as an internal control and yeast tRNA as a negative control to test for the presence of the probe self-protection bands. Exposure was 1 day. herg1- andhcyc-protected bands are indicated by an arrow. a, densitometric analysis of the herg1expression, relative to Fig. 1 A; b, densitometric analysis of the herg1 N135 expression reported in this figure.

Bruggemann A. Camacho J. Stuhmer W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 767-775Google Scholar, 38Cahalan M.D. Wulff H. Chandy K.G. J. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 21: 235-252Google Scholar), we tested whether the above-mentioned genes were overexpressed in the tumor cell lines under study. Fig. 2 shows the expression ofeag and Kv 1.3 genes in SH-SY5Y, FLG 29.1, H630, RD12, and SkBr3 cells, as detected by RT-PCR. It is evident that, despite the good quality of all the cDNAs tested (seegapdh expression in the lower panel of Fig. 2), only SH-SY5Y, as reported previously (39Meyer R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 49-56Google Scholar), and RD12 cells, as expected (40Occhiodoro T. Bernheim L. Liu J.H. Bijlenga P. Sinnreich M. Bader C.R. Fischer-Lougheed J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 177-182Google Scholar), express the eag gene. Kv 1.3 is not expressed in any of the tumor cell lines examined, although it is present in human peripheral resting lymphocytes as reported previously (33Smith G.A.M. Tsui H.-W. Newell E.W. Jiang X. Zhu X.-P. Tsui F, W.L. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18528-18534Google Scholar).Figure 2Expression of eag andKv 1.3 transcripts in tumor cell lines. RNA was extracted from SH-SY5Y, RD12, H630, FLG 29.1, and SKBr3 tumor cell lines, as well as from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). cDNA was retrotranscribed and amplified using specific primers for the eag and Kv 1.3K+ channel genes as reported under “Materials and Methods.” For each cell line used, lane 1 represents amplification of the Kv 1.3 gene, and lane 2represents amplification of the eag gene. Lymphocyte cDNA was amplified for the Kv 1.3 gene and was used as the positive control. Lower panel, RT-PCR of the control gene gapdh in the various tumor cell lines as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)On the whole, data presented in Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate that cancer cell lines preferentially express the herg1 gene. Neitherherg2 nor -3 nor the other Kv encoding genes that have been proposed to play a role in the control of cell proliferation (i.e. eag and Kv 1.3) are expressed at the RNA level, irrespective of the histological origin of the cancer cell lines tested. This result rules out the possibility that theherg RNA profile (11Bianchi L. Wible B. Arcangeli A. Taglialatela M. Morra F. Castaldo P. Crociani O. Rosati B. Faravelli L. Olivotto M. Wanke E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 815-822Google Scholar) as well as the HERG biophysical features specific of the different tumor cell lines that we have tested are due to coexpression of different proportions of the products of the three herg genes. The possibility of deletions as well as alternative splicing products of the herg1 gene in tumor cells was then investigated. Because tumor IHERG was demonstrated previously (30Schönnher R. Rosati B. Hehl S. Rao V.G. Arcangeli A. Olivotto M. Heinemann S. Wanke E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 753-760Google Scholar) to display fast deactivation kinetics, a feature associated with a deletion in the N-terminal domain, we first looked for the existence of herg1 deletions and/or splicing modifications at this level.A probe was constructed (N(135) herg1 terminus) for RPA experiments, comprising the first 135 amino acids of the HERG1 sequence, i.e. the eag domain. The results of this experiment are reported in Fig. 3. The eag domain is present in the herg1 transcript of all the tumor cell lines tested; however, when comparing the densitometric analysis of the results obtained with theherg1 probe, encompassing a conserved region of the gene (Fig. 1), with the densitometric analysis of the experiments performed with the N(135) herg1 terminus probe (see Fig. 3, a and b), it is evident that theeag domain is expressed at a lower level, especially in SH-SY5Y and FLG 29.1 cells. A possible explanation of these data is that tumor cells express both a full-length herg1 mRNA, and a truncated form of the latter, lacking part or the entire N terminus.The possibility that such N-truncated RNA could belong to the already identified herg1 alternative transcript namedherg1b was then tested. First, the expression ofherg1b was studied in two different tumor cell lines (SH-SY5Y and FLG 29.1 cells) by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4 A, herg1b mRNA is indeed expressed in both the cell lines tested. The possibility of the simultaneous expression of herg1 and herg1bin tumor cell lines was then investigated by constructing probes for RPA experiments comprising first the entire herg1b exon and part of exon 6, which is shared by herg1 andherg1b genes (27London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Google Scholar, 28Lees-Miller J.P. Kondo C. Wang L. Duff H.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 719-726Google Scholar). If both herg1 andherg1b are expressed in tumor cells, two RPA bands would be expected with molecular weights 258 and 363 bp, respectively. This result indeed occurred (see Fig. 4 B) both in SH-SY5Y and FLG 29.1 cells and in the heart. Note that this is not common to all tissues expressing herg1, as only a lower RPA band was detectable in brain RNA, corresponding to the herg1 gene. Moreover, observing the two bands present in FLG 29.1 cells, it is evident that the upper band (attributable to herg1b) has a higher intensity compared with the lower band corresponding toherg1. As tumor cell lines are deregulated in terms of their RNA expression, we analyzed whether herg1b mRNA could be detected in primary human tumors. We demonstrated recently (41Pillozzi S. Brizzi M.F. Balzi M. Crociani O. Cherubini A. Guasti L. Bartolozzi B. Becchetti A. Wanke E. Bernabei P.A. Olivotto M. Pegoraro L. Arcangeli A. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 1791-1798Google Scholar) that the herg1 gene is expressed in human myeloid leukemias; hence, we chose these cells as samples because they are not contaminated by other cell types, such as stromal or smooth muscle cells, that could express the herg1b transcript (27London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Google Scholar, 28Lees-Miller J.P. Kondo C. Wang L. Duff H.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 719-726Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C, all of the primary myeloid leukemias we tested expressed the herg1b exon, ruling out the possibility that such expression is exclusively an artifact related to the altered gene expression occurring in established tumor cell lines.Figure 4herg1bexpression in tumor cell lines. A, RT-PCR. RNA extracted from FLG 29.1 and SH-SY5Y (seeupper labels) was retrotranscribed and amplified using primers specific for herg1b (see “Materials and Methods”).

St,32P-UTP-labeled molecular weight marker (Ambion). The results were obtained after 8 days of exposure and show a specificherg1b-protected band in all the samples tested except for the brain. Human cyclophilin (Ambion) was used as an internal control and yeast tRNA as a negative control to test for the presence of the probe self-protection bands. C, RT-PCR on primary acute myeloid leukemias. RNA was extracted from various primary acute myeloid leukemias of different FAB phenotypes (M0 to M7, see upper labels) and processed as described in the legend to A.RNA from FLG 29.1 human monoblastic cell line was used as positive control. Lane labeled as noRNA-noDNA represents the negative control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The nature of the transcript containing the herg1b exon in tumor cells was then investigated by cloning the entire transcript from tumor cells. Clones obtained by RT-PCR and 3′-RACE PCR (see “Materials and Methods”) were sequenced demonstrating that tumors cells do express the entire herg1b alternative transcript (GenBankTM accession number AJ512214). Theherg1b transcript cloned from tumor cells was identical to that identified in human heart (27London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Google Scholar, 28Lees-Miller J.P. Kondo C. Wang L. Duff H.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 719-726Google Scholar), except for two polymorphisms (in position 689 and 953 of the submitted sequence), and identical to that reported for the herg1 sequence cloned from neuroblastoma cells (11Bianchi L. Wible B. Arcangeli A. Taglialatela M. Morra F. Castaldo P. Crociani O. Rosati B. Faravelli L. Olivotto M. Wanke E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 815-822Google Scholar). It is worth noting here that, as stated in the Introduction and reported under “Materials and Methods,” the sequence of the herg1b exon was confirmed on the genomic sequence of chromosome 7, suggesting the possibility thatherg1b represents an alternate transcript more than a splice variant.Furthermore, because data gathered from our RPA experiments showed that, in FLG 29.1 cells, herg1b represented the greatest amount of the total HERG mRNA, the next step was to determine whether the encoded protein HERG1B was expressed on the plasma membrane. Western blot experiments were, therefore, performed on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and FLG 29.1 leukemia cells, using anti-HERG antibodies, specific for both the C and N termini (see “Materials and Methods”).When experiments were performed with an anti-C terminus antibody (Fig. 5 A), two main bands were detectable in herg1-transfected cells, weighing 135 and about 155 kDa, respectively, as expected (29Pond A.L. Scheve B.K. Benedict A.T. Petrecca K. Van Wagoner D.R. Shrier A.S. Nerbonne J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5997-6006Google Scholar, 42Zhou Z. Gong Q., Ye, B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Google Scholar). On the other hand, in SH-SY5Y and FLG 29.1 cells, two main groups of bands could be seen: an upper group ranging from 135 to ∼155 kDa, and a lower group ranging from 85 to ∼100 kDa. It is worth noting that the upper group of bands is more evident in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas they are barely detectable in FLG 29.1 cells. The possibility that both the two groups represented HERG proteins expressed on the plasma membrane was then tested by performing experiments on cells treated with specific enzymes used to evaluate the glycosylation state (N-glycosidase F) as well as the plasma membrane expression (proteinase K) of HERG proteins. As shown in Fig. 5 B, when membrane extracts from both SH-SY5Y and FLG 29.1 cells were treated withN-glycosidase F (lanes 1), both the bands of ∼155 and those ∼100 kDa shifted to lower molecular weights. Furthermore, when cells were treated with proteinase K (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3) both the bands of ∼155 and those of ∼100 kDa disappeared, and only the bands of ∼135 and ∼85 kDa could be seen. The results were similar in both cell lines tested; the only difference was that all the bands of lower molecular weight were preferentially expressed in FLG 29.1 cells, whereas those of higher molecular weight were observed only after longer exposure of the autoradiographic film (see Fig. 5 B, inset).Figure 5HERG protein expression inherg1-transfected cells and in tumor cell lines.Membrane proteins were extracted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the anti-HERG C-terminal antibody (Alomone Labs) as reported under “Materials and Methods.” A, HERG protein expression in HEK 293 MOCK-transfected cells (293 MOCK), in HEK 293 transfected with the herg1 clone (293 HERG1), in SH-SY5Y cells, and in FLG 29.1 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2148019980,"NFκB is a critical transcription factor involved in modulating cellular responses to environmental injuries. Tyrosine 42 phosphorylation of IκBα has been shown to mediate NFκB activation following hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) or pervanadate treatment. This pathway differs from the canonical proinflammatory pathways, which mediate NFκB activation through serine phosphorylation of IκBα by the IKK complex. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of c-Src in the redox activation of NFκB following H/R or pervanadate treatment. Our results demonstrate that pervanadate or H/R treatment leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and NFκB transcriptional activation independent of the IKK pathway. In contrast, inhibition of c-Src by pp2 treatment or in c-Src (−/−) knockout cell lines, demonstrated a significant reduction in IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation and NFκB activation following pervanadate or H/R treatment. Overexpression of glutathione peroxidase-1 or catalase, but not Mn-SOD or Cu,Zn-SOD, significantly reduced both NFκB activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. In vitro kinase assays further demonstrated that immunoprecipitated c-Src has the capacity to directly phosphorylate GST-IκBα and that this IκBα kinase activity is significantly reduced by Gpx-1 overexpression. These results suggest that c-Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and subsequent activation of NFκB is controlled by intracellular H2O2 and defines an important redox-regulated pathway for NFκB activation following H/R injury that is independent of the IKK complex.

Three major sources of intracellular ROS include the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system, receptor-coupled NADPH oxidase at the cellular membrane, and the mitochondrial electron transport system (1Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 1999; 1: 5-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2Saugstad O.D. Pediatrics. 1996; 98: 103-107PubMed Google Scholar). ROS have been increasingly recognized as critical components in disease and stress-induced cellular injuries such as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), UV irradiation, and inflammation. These ROS can lead to direct cellular damage and can also act as intracellular second messengers to modulate signal transduction pathways. One such redox-regulated transcription factor is NFκB (3Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). NFκB family members include p50, p52, p65, and c-RelB, which form homodimeric and heterodimeric transcriptional complexes (4Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). The activation of NFκB is controlled by a family of IκB repressor proteins (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε) that sequester NFκB in the cytoplasm (4Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of IκB proteins leads to the mobilization of NFκB to the nucleus where it can act as a transcription factor. These phosphorylation pathways have been most extensively studied for IκBα and include two distinct mechanisms involving either serine or tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. The most comprehensively studied pathway regulating IκBα includes phosphorylation on two serine (32 and 36) residues by the IκB kinase complex (IKK) (5Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation leads to ubiquitination of IκBα at nearby lysine residues and degradation by the proteasome. An alternative, less characterized pathway of NFκB activation acts through tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα at residue 42 (6). In contrast to IKK-mediated serine phosphorylation of IκBα, tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα is capable of activating NFκB in the absence of ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκBα. However, it is presently unclear if IKK and/or the IκBα protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) interactions with IκBα are functionally modulated by prior tyrosine or serine phosphorylation of IκBα, respectively. Experimental evidence appears to suggest that prior tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα on Tyr-42 may prevent interactions with the IKK complex and inhibit serine phosphorylation on Ser-32/Ser-36 (7Singh S. Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31049-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Hence, the existence of reciprocal interactions between IKK- and PTK-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα and the net effect on NFκB transcriptional activation remains an open question. Although the exact identity of the IκB tyrosine kinase has not yet been demonstrated using in vitro reconstitution assays, both PI 3-kinase and c-Src have been demonstrated to associate with tyrosine phosphorylated IκBα in T-cells following pervanadate treatment (8Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) following TNFα stimulus (9Abu-Amer Y.

In addition to pervanadate, H/R has also been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα in T-cells in vitro (6Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C.

Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase p56lck is required for IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation and NFκB activation in T-lymphocytes following pervanadate treatment (6Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Loss of tyrosine kinases p56lck and ZAP-70 in two Jurkat mutants abolished NFκB activation and partially suppressed and delayed phosphorylation of Tyr-42 on IκBα in response to pervanadate treatment (11Livolsi A. Busuttil V. Imbert V. Abraham R.T. Peyron J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, this study in T-cells also demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα was not sufficient to activate NFκB and suggests that both tyrosine and serine kinases act at multiple levels to dissociate the IκBα/NFκB complex. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα is observed in BMMs following TNFα treatment, and this phosphorylation requires c-Src activity (9Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. McHugh K.P. Livolsi A. Peyron J.F. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Given the historical dependence of TNFα-mediated activation of NFκB on the IKK complex and serine phosphorylation of IκBα, the functional involvement of IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TNFα appears to be quite unique to BMMs. Furthermore, the vast majority of studies evaluating the importance of IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation to date have been performed in hematopoetically derived T-cells or BMMs. Thus, the functional relevance of these systems to epithelial models of ischemia/reperfusion remains an open question. Since c-Src can be directly activated by H2O2 (12Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), pervanadate (13Shi S. Garcia J.G. Roy S. Parinandi N.L. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L441-L451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), hypoxia (14Koong A.C. Chen E.Y. Mivechi N.F. Denko N.C. Stambrook P. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5273-5279PubMed Google Scholar), or hypoxia/reoxygenation (15Seko Y. Tobe K. Takahashi N. Kaburagi Y. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), its central involvement in ROS-mediated IKK and PTK activation of NFκB appears reasonable. It is also recognized that H2O2 is capable of activating both IKK- and PTK-dependent pathways of IκBα phosphorylation and NFκB activation in T-cells (11Livolsi A. Busuttil V. Imbert V. Abraham R.T. Peyron J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to investigate the involvement of c-Src in the redox-mediated activation of NFκB activation following H/R or pervanadate treatments in an epithelial cell line (HeLa cells). Since both IKK-dependent and independent pathways of NFκB activation have been associated with c-Src activation, we used a number of adenoviral vectors expressing dominant mutants of IKKα, IKKβ, and IκBα to selectively test for serine or tyrosine IκBα phosphorylation-dependent transcriptional activation of NFκB. In contrast to previous studies, we have utilized an NFκB-responsive luciferase reporter gene to directly assess changes in the transcriptional activation of NFκB. Since the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα with PI 3-kinase has been suggested in proposed models to alter the transcriptional properties of NFκB dimers (8Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 11Livolsi A. Busuttil V. Imbert V. Abraham R.T. Peyron J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1508-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), direct functional assessment of activation may be more informative than assessing DNA binding. Triple knockout cell lines (c-Src−/−, Fyn−/−, Yes−/−) with and without c-Src were also used to confirm the dependence of IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation on c-Src. Furthermore, recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing various ROS scavengers were used to test whether activation of these pathways contained redox-sensitive components. Results from these studies indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and NFκB activation is mediated through redox activation of c-Src. Several E1-deleted recombinant adenoviral vectors were used to modulate the NFκB pathway and assay for transcriptional induction of NFκB. Previously described vectors included the dominant negative mutants Ad.IKKα(KM) (16Sanlioglu S. Williams C.M. Samavati L. Butler N.S. Wang G. McCray P.B., Jr. Ritchie T.C. Hunninghake G.W. Zandi E.

Yang J. Engelhardt J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4843-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All adenoviral vectors, except for Ad.NFκBluc, used the CMV enhancer/promoter to express the transgene. Recombinant adenovirus was purified by two rounds of CsCl centrifugation and desalted prior to use as described (19Davis A.R. Wilson J.M. Dracopoli N.C. Haines J.L. Korf B.R. Morton C.C. Seidman C.E.

HeLa, SYF, and SYF+c-Src cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. For the tyrosine phosphorylation assays, HeLa cells were transduced with Ad.IKKα(KM), Ad.IKKβ(KA), Ad.IκBα(S32A/S36A), Ad.IκBα(Y42F), or Ad.BglII at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) equal to 1000 particles/cell. For the NFκB luciferase reporter assay, HeLa cells were co-infected with Ad.NFκBLuc at an MOI = 500 particles/cell and Ad.IKKα(KM), Ad.IKKβ(KA), Ad.IκBα(S32A/S36A), or Ad.IκBα(Y42F) at an MOI = 1000 particles/cell. Luciferase reporter assays in SYF and SYF+c-Src cells were performed following infection with Ad.NFκBLuc alone at an MOI = 500 particles/cell. Adenoviral infections were performed for 2 h in DMEM without FBS followed by the addition of an equal volume of 20% FBS, DMEM and continued incubation for 22 h. Virus-containing media was replaced at 24 h post-infection with 10% FBS/DMEM. Typically, experiments were initiated at 24 h post-transduction. Experimental methods used to induce NFκB were performed according to the following protocols. Sodium orthovanadate was prepared fresh in water at a concentration of 500 mm. 40 μl of sodium orthovanadate and 5 μl of 30% (w/w) H2O2 was then added to 455 μl phosphate-buffered saline. This mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature prior to the addition of catalase (200 μg/ml) to remove the excess H2O2. The pervanadate solution (final concentration 40 mm) was further incubated for 5 min at room temperature, immediately diluted in DMEM and applied to cells. Cells were harvested at 6 h post-pervanadate treatments for NFκB activation using luciferase assays or as indicated. Control cells were fed with identical fresh medium that was devoid of pervanadate. DMEM (devoid of glucose or FBS) (Invitrogen) equilibrated in 95% N2, 5% CO2 or 95% O2, 5% CO2 was used as hypoxia and reoxygenation medium, respectively. Cells were covered with minimal hypoxia medium and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h in an airtight chamber equilibrated with 5% CO2 and 95% N2. The medium was then replaced with a minimal amount of reoxygenation medium and incubated further at 37 °C in a chamber flushed with 5% CO2 and 95% O2. Cells were harvested 6 h after reoxygenation for NFκB activation luciferase assays. Control cells were fed with fresh medium at identical times as the hypoxia/reoxygenation samples, but were exposed to 5% CO2 in atmospheric oxygen. Mouse recombinant TNFα (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) was diluted in fresh DMEM medium (10 ng/ml final concentration) and applied to cells at the time of treatment. Cells remained exposed to TNFα until they were harvested at 6 h post-stimulation for NFκB activation luciferase assays. Control cells were fed at the time of treatment with fresh DMEM medium without TNFα. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mmTris pH 7.2, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), and the protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 5 μg of cell lysate was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using previously described protocols (18Fan C. Yang J. Engelhardt J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4843-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). IκBα protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-IκBα monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). To evaluate IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation, 200 μg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of IκBα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by Western blot analysis using antiphosphotyrosine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and standard protocols (10Zwacka R.M. Zhang Y. Zhou W. Halldorson J. Engelhardt J.F. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated forms of c-Src or total c-Src were detected using anti-c-SrcPY416, anti-c-SrcPY139, and anti-c-Src antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). NFκB transcriptional activity was evaluated using an Ad.NFκBLuc reporter vector as previously described (16Sanlioglu S. Williams C.M. Samavati L. Butler N.S. Wang G. McCray P.B., Jr. Ritchie T.C. Hunninghake G.W. Zandi E. Engelhardt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30188-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were infected with Ad.NFκBLuc at an MOI of 500 particles/cell 24 h prior to TNF-α, pervanadate, or H/R treatment. 5 μg of total protein from each sample was assayed for luciferase activity using manufacturer's protocols (Promega, Madison, WI) in a luminometer as previously reported (16Sanlioglu S. Williams C.M. Samavati L. Butler N.S. Wang G. McCray P.B., Jr. Ritchie T.C. Hunninghake G.W. Zandi E. Engelhardt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30188-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was assessed as relative light units and used as an indicator for the transcription induction of NFκB. To assess potential global changes in transcription induced by each type of environmental stimuli, that were not dependent on NFκB, several experiments were performed normalizing changes in Ad.NFκBLuc expression to that seen with a control Ad.CMVLacZ vector (20Engelhardt J.F. Yang Y. Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Allen E.D. Kozarsky K. Perricaudet M. Yankaskas J.R. Wilson J.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In these studies both Ad.NFκBLuc and Ad.CMVLacZ were co-infected into cells for each of the conditions examined (MOI = 500 particles/cell for each vector) 24 h prior to TNF-α, pervanadate, or H/R treatment. Luciferase activity was then assessed using 5 μg of lysate as described above, and β-galactosidase activity was quantified with 5 μg of lysate using a previously described protocol (21Duan D. Yue Y. Yan Z. Engelhardt J.F. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was then normalized for β-galactosidase expression in reference to the Ad.BglII infected (no injury) control. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays for NFκB DNA binding were performed as previously described using a 32P-labeled NFκB oligonucleotide probe (18Fan C. Yang J. Engelhardt J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4843-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Two types of in vitrokinase assays (radioactive and non-radioactive) were used to evaluate the ability of immunoprecipitated c-Src or IKKβ to phosphorylate GST-IκBα in vitro following different environmental stimuli. For radioactive in vitro kinase assays, HeLa, SYF, or SYF+c-Src cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was then determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 500 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Src or anti-IKKβ antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-agarose beads. 1 μg of GST-IkBα protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then added to washed protein A pellets in the presence of 10 μl of kinase buffer (40 mm Hepes, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmnitrophenolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm cold ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of protein-loading buffer (with SDS) and boiled at 98 °C for 5 min. Samples were then centrifuged to remove the agarose beads, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (which reduces the background of free [γ-32P]ATP) and exposed to x-ray film. Non-radioactivein vitro kinase assays were performed to directly evaluate the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-IκBα by immunoprecipitated c-Src or IKKβ. These in vitro kinase assays were performed identical to the protocol described above except for the omission of [γ-32P]ATP. In vitrolabeled GST-IκBα samples were then evaluated by Western blotting for the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation using antiphosphotyrosine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). NFκB activation can occur through at least two mechanisms that control IκBα phosphorylation on either tyrosine 42 or serine 32/36. Proinflammatory stimuli such as TNFα are well suited to activate NFκB through the IκB kinase complex (IKK) that mediates serine phosphorylation of IκBα and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκBα. In contrast, NFκB activation in the liver following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (10Zwacka R.M. Zhang Y. Zhou W. Halldorson J. Engelhardt J.F. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and in T-cells following H/R (6Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), occurs in the absence of IκBα degradation and is associated with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. To better define the mechanisms involved in NFκB activation following I/R injury, we developed an in vitro epithelial cell line model system capable of modulating NFκB activity through tyrosine or serine phosphorylation of IκBα following H/R, pervanadate, or TNFα treatments. To establish that NFκB activation following H/R occurs through a selective pathway involving tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα that is independent of the IKK complex, we utilized several dominant negative mutants to modulate IKK activation and IκBα phosphorylation. NFκB transcriptional activity was evaluated using a recombinant adenoviral reporter vector (Ad.NFκBLuc) expressing the NFκB-inducible luciferase gene. As expected and previously reported in epithelial cell lines, the transcriptional induction of NFκB following TNFα treatment was significantly inhibited (p < 0.001) by expression of Ad.IKKβ(KA), Ad.IKKα(KM), or Ad.IκBα(S32A/S36A) in comparison to Ad.BglII (empty vector control)-transduced cells (Fig. 1 A). No inhibition in TNFα-induced NFκB activation was seen following expression of Ad.IκBαY42F. These results confirm the functionality of our vectors to inhibit IKK-mediated TNFα activation of NFκB and demonstrate a lack of functional involvement of IκBα Y42 phosphorylation under these conditions. In contrast to findings with TNFα, IκΒα(Y42F) expression significantly inhibited NFκΒ transcriptional activation following pervanadate (p < 0.001) or H/R (p < 0.001) treatments (Fig. 1,A and B). No significant alterations in pervanadate or H/R-mediated activation of NFκB was seen following infection with Ad.IKKβ(KA), Ad.IKKα(KM), or Ad.IκΒα(S32A/S36A) mutant vectors. Furthermore, when the induction of NFκB-mediated luciferase expression was normalized to changes in expression of an irrelevant internal control LacZ transgene under the control of the CMV promoter, the patterns and changes for each of the environmental stimuli and dominant mutants tested were not significantly altered (Fig. 1, A–C). These data demonstrate that global changes in the overall transcriptional state of cells cannot account for the specific alterations induced by the various dominant mutants for a given stimulus. To confirm that changes in transcriptional activation of NFκΒ mirrored those seen in DNA binding, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed for each of the various stimuli. These results shown in Fig. 1 D confirm that NFκB transcriptional activation is accompanied by increased DNA binding in nuclear extracts. Cumulatively, our results evaluating IKK and IκBα mutants suggest that IKK-mediated serine 32/36 phosphorylation of IκBα does not play a significant role in regulating NFκB following pervanadate or H/R stimuli in our HeLa cell line model. To directly evaluate whether TNF-α imparts selective activation of the IKK complex not observed following H/R or pervanadate treatments, we performed in vitro kinase assays with immunoprecipitated IKKβ to directly evaluate IKK activation and ability to phosphorylate GST-IκBα following each of these stimuli. Results from this analysis are shown in Fig. 1 E and demonstrate that TNF-α treatment stimulates higher levels of IKK activity as compared with H/R and pervanadate treatments. However, activation of IKK was also observed at lower levels following both H/R and pervanadate treatments, suggesting that some overlap in signaling may exist. This apparent overlap may be due to pervanadate and H/R activation of cytokines, which restimulate cells through the IKK pathway. These findings substantiate the small non-significant, but observed, partial inhibition of NFκB transcriptional activation by IKK mutants seen following H/R and pervanadate treatments. Our results in the HeLa cell model have established that NFκB activation following H/R or pervanadate treatment is independent of IKK and serine phosphorylation of IκBα. We next sought to evaluate candidate upstream factors capable of mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and subsequent NFκB activation. Src family kinases are widely recognized for their importance in regulating stress response genes in response to redox-regulated stimuli such as H/R (15Seko Y. Tobe K. Takahashi N. Kaburagi Y. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Bolli R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 972-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that c-Src activity was necessary for TNFα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα in BMMs (9Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. McHugh K.P. Livolsi A. Peyron J.F. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Given the lack of a functional requirement for IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation in the transcriptional induction of NFκB following TNFα in our epithelial cell line model, we investigated whether c-Src might also play a role in NFκB activation following H/R or pervanadate treatment. Consistent with the activation of c-Src following H/R or pervanadate treatment, we observed an increase in both Tyr-416- and Tyr-139-phosphorylated forms of activated c-Src (Fig. 2). H/R treatment demonstrated a greater increase in both phosphorylated forms while pervanadate treatment more selectively increased the Tyr-416-phosphorylated form of c-Src. These findings suggest that indeed c-Src is activated by both pervanadate or H/R treatment and is consistent with the previously reported redox-mediated involvement in the activation of c-Src (15Seko Y. Tobe K. Takahashi N. Kaburagi Y. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To assign functional importance to c-Src in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and subsequent activation of NFκB, we next evaluated the effect of the pp2 c-Src inhibitor.

https://openalex.org/W2015081015,"There are recent reports of weak ferromagnetism in graphite and synthetic carbon materials such as rhombohedral C(60) (ref. 4), as well as a theoretical prediction of a ferromagnetic instability in graphene sheets. With very small ferromagnetic signals, it is difficult to be certain that the origin is intrinsic, rather than due to minute concentrations of iron-rich impurities. Here we take a different experimental approach to study ferromagnetism in graphitic materials, by making use of meteoritic graphite, which is strongly ferromagnetic at room temperature. We examined ten samples of extraterrestrial graphite from a nodule in the Canyon Diablo meteorite. Graphite is the major phase in every sample, but there are minor amounts of magnetite, kamacite, akaganéite, and other phases. By analysing the phase composition of a series of samples, we find that these iron-rich minerals can only account for about two-thirds of the observed magnetization. The remainder is somehow associated with graphite, corresponding to an average magnetization of 0.05 Bohr magnetons per carbon atom. The magnetic ordering temperature is near 570 K. We suggest that the ferromagnetism is a magnetic proximity effect induced at the interface with magnetite or kamacite inclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2035701756,"Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its association with the tyrosine kinase, c-Src, is correlated with increased cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. Previous studies have shown that EGFR and c-Src co-overexpression and association leads to the c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine 845 of the EGFR and that mutation of Tyr845 ablates epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis. Here, we investigate the contribution of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT5b) in the signaling pathways regulated by EGFR and c-Src overexpression in human breast tumor cell lines as well as in a mouse fibroblast model (C3H10T1/2). We demonstrate that 1) activation of STAT5b by EGF requires overexpression of the EGFR, 2) co-overexpression of c-Src alone does not result in EGF-induced activation of STAT5b but enhances that seen in EGFR-overexpressing cells, and 3) EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b requires Tyr845 of the EGFR. Furthermore, the stable overexpression of a kinase-defective c-Src in the context of EGFR overexpression results in a decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b in response to EGF and a more dramatic decrease in EGF-induced transcriptional activation of STAT5b, suggesting an integral role for c-Src in the physiological actions of STAT5b. Using a dominant negative STAT5b, we provide evidence that one such physiological action is to mediate EGF-induced DNA-synthesis. Finally, the use of site-specific tyrosine mutants demonstrates that EGF-induced phosphorylation of STAT5b involves not only tyrosine 699 of STAT5b, which is required for its transcriptional activation, but also three previously identified tyrosines in the C terminus of STAT5b (Tyr725/Tyr740/Tyr743). Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its association with the tyrosine kinase, c-Src, is correlated with increased cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. Previous studies have shown that EGFR and c-Src co-overexpression and association leads to the c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine 845 of the EGFR and that mutation of Tyr845 ablates epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis. Here, we investigate the contribution of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT5b) in the signaling pathways regulated by EGFR and c-Src overexpression in human breast tumor cell lines as well as in a mouse fibroblast model (C3H10T1/2).

Examples of such proteins include the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)1 family and cellular c-Src tyrosine kinase (1Biscardi J.S. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Adv.

It has been estimated that overexpression of HER family members (HER1/EGFR, HER2/neu, HER3, and HER4) occurs in ∼67% of human breast cancers (3Sainsbury J. Farndon J. Needham G. Malcolm A. Harris A.

Elevated levels of the EGFR are associated with the loss of estrogen-dependent growth of tumors and are found predominantly in metastatic sites rather than in primary tumors, suggesting a role for the EGFR in later stages of tumor progression (3Sainsbury J.

Overexpression of c-Src is found in greater than 70% of breast cancers and thus frequently accompanies EGFR overexpression (2Ottenhoff-Kalff A.E. Rijksen G. van Beurden E.A. Hennipman A. Michels A.A.

Not only has c-Src been shown to be involved in the normal process of EGF-induced mitogenesis (9Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Roche S. Koegl M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell.

Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 61-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Biscardi J.S. Ishizawar R.C. Silva C.M. Parsons S.J.

A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Model cell lines have been instrumental in characterizing the role of EGFR and c-Src co-overexpression and association in the process of tumor formation. In the mouse fibroblast cell model (C3H10T1/2), overexpression of both the EGF receptor and c-Src leads to synergistic increases in mitogenesis, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenesis in nude mice as compared with overexpression of the EGFR or c-Src alone (14Maa M.-C. Leu T.-H. McCarley D. Schatzman R. Parsons S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This increased tumorigenesis correlates with the EGF-induced physical association of the EGF receptor with c-Src, tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor at two novel sites, and an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of two EGF receptor substrates: the Src homology 2-containing adapter protein (Shc) and phospholipase Cγ. These studies provide evidence for the cooperativity between c-Src and EGF receptor in the process of tumor formation. Importantly, this association between EGF receptor and c-Src has also been described in a number of human breast cancer cell lines (13Biscardi J.S. Belsches A.P. Parsons S.J. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 21: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A panel of 14 human breast tumor cell lines was characterized with regard to the presence or absence of the estrogen receptor, the levels of EGFR and c-Src, and the presence or absence of EGFR/c-Src complexes. Five of the 14 cell lines were found to overexpress both the EGF receptor and c-Src, and such co-overexpression correlated with an association between these two proteins and phosphorylation of the EGFR on the same two novel sites as was found in the mouse fibroblast system. These findings suggested a mechanistic cooperation between the two tyrosine kinases. In fact, as compared with breast tumor cell lines expressing normal levels of either protein, the EGFR/c-Src double overexpressors generally exhibited increased EGF-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and formation of aggressive tumors in nude mice. The mechanisms responsible for the cooperativity between the EGFR and c-Src tyrosine kinases that lead to tumorigenesis are beginning to be elucidated. The two novel tyrosine phosphorylations on the EGFR that are dependent upon c-Src have been identified as Tyr845 and Tyr1101 (15Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Tyr1101 on the EGFR, which itself is not an autophosphorylation site, is located in the C-terminal tail of the EGFR among the known autophosphorylation sites. The function of Tyr1101 is unknown. Tyr845 is located on the activation loop of the catalytic domain. In other tyrosine kinase receptors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, colony-stimulating factor, insulin, hepatocyte growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor, the homologous site is an autophosphorylation site required for full activity of the enzyme (12Biscardi J.S. Ishizawar R.C. Silva C.M. Parsons S.J. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Tyr845 is dependent on the kinase activity of c-Src (16Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the kinase activity of c-Src is required for the biological synergy between c-Src and the EGFR that results in increased mitogenesis, growth in soft agar, and tumor formation. Most importantly, mutation of Tyr845 to phenylalanine ablates EGF-induced increases in DNA synthesis. This ablation occurs despite the presence of intact EGFR kinase activity, increases in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (15Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 16Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that other, as yet unidentified, biochemical signaling pathways that are activated by the c-Src mediated phosphorylation of Tyr845of the EGFR must be operative in triggering cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), originally identified in interferon signaling, can be activated by a number of cytokines and growth factors, including EGF (17Ihle J. Witthuhn B. Quelle F. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 18Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Activation of STATs involves phosphorylation of a single tyrosine at the C terminus, hetero- or homodimerization, and translocation to the nucleus, where STATs bind to consensus elements in the promoter of genes that are regulated (19Leaman D.W. Leung S., Li, X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 20Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). STAT proteins are normally involved in a variety of cellular processes including mitogenesis, differentiation, and apoptosis (21Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar), but accumulating evidence supports a role for STAT proteins in oncogenesis. STAT1, -3, and -5 are all activated in cells transformed by the v-Src oncogene (22Garcia R., Yu, C.-L. Hudnall R. Catlett K. Nelson T. Fujita D.J. Ethier S.P. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1267-1276PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sartor C.I. Dziubinski M.L., Yu, C.L. Jove R. Ethier S.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 978-987PubMed Google Scholar, 24Watson C.J. Miller W.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and studies have demonstrated that STAT3 is required for v-Src-induced transformation (25Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that the stable overexpression of the EGFR in 293HEK cells leads to the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation of STAT5b (27Kloth M.T. Catling A.D. Silva C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8693-8701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Given the precedence for the role of STAT proteins in oncogenesis, we have investigated the potential role of these transcription factors in the signaling pathways activated by EGFR and c-Src co-overexpression in the C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblast model and in human breast tumor cell lines. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the EGFR, the kinase activities of the EGFR and c-Src, and the c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr845 of the EGFR are required for EGF-induced STAT5b activation in breast cancer cell models. Finally, evidence is provided that STAT5b is required for EGF-induced DNA synthesis. Together, these studies support the potentially important role of STAT5b in the process of tumorigenesis. C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblast cell lines, engineered to stably overexpress the human EGFR, wild type c-Src (K+), or kinase-inactive (A430V) c-Src (K−), have been described previously (14Maa M.-C.

These cells were grown under selection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 400 μg/ml G418. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from STAT5a/5b knockout mice were kindly provided by Dr. J. Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) (28Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E.

These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB468, MDA-MB231, MCF-7, SK-BR-3, BT-20, and BT-549) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were passaged twice per week and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Recombinant human growth hormone was from Genentech (San Francisco, CA); recombinant human EGF was from Invitrogen; and the c-Src inhibitor, PP2, was from Calbiochem. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (sc-7020) and polyclonal anti-EGFR (sc-03) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-STAT5A/B (Tyr694/Tyr699) is a mouse monoclonal from Upstate biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-HA antibody (16B12) was purchased from Babco (Richmond, CA). Polyclonal STAT5a- and STAT5b-specific antibodies were developed in our laboratory (29Silva C.M. Kloth M.T. Kawecki M.A. Catling A.D. Proceedings of the 80th Annual Endocrine Society Meeting, June 24–27, New Orleans, LA. The Endocrine Society, Bethesda, MD1998: 1-119Google Scholar). Construction of the tyrosine mutants of human STAT5b has been described previously (27Kloth M.T. Catling A.D. Silva C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8693-8701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Prestained molecular weight standards as well as all tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Except where noted, other reagents were either reagent or molecular biological grade from Sigma. Cells were preincubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin overnight. In some experiments, cells were pretreated for 15 min at 37 °C with 10 μm PP2. After preincubation, cells were treated either with medium alone (control), 200 ng/ml recombinant human growth hormone, or 100 ng/ml rhEGF at 37 °C for 15 min. At the end of this incubation, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate (PBS-VO4), scraped into 2 ml of PBS-VO4, and then pelleted by centrifugation. Cell pellets were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). All lysis buffers contained protease and phosphatase inhibitors (25 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.071 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm vanadate, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were stored at −70 °C until use. Upon thawing, lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation (82,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and resulting supernatants were analyzed as described below. The protein amount was determined using the BCA™ protein assay from Pierce. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of protein lysate was incubated with antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose or protein G-Plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Agarose pellets were washed three times in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and bound proteins were removed by heating to 100 °C in 1× Laemmli buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For direct analysis of extracts, detergent lysates, prepared as described above, were mixed 1:1 with 2× Laemmli buffer. Both total lysates and immunoprecipitates were fractionated through a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted as described previously (31Silva C.M., Lu, H. Weber M.J. Thorner M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27532-27539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blocking buffers contained TBS-T (0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and either 3% bovine serum albumin for the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or 5% nonfat dry milk for all other antibodies. Donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used as secondary antibodies and detected by ECL™ (Amersham Biosciences). In some cases, blots were reprobed after stripping in buffer (2% SDS, 0.1m 2-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) at 70 °C for 80 min. C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts were transfected according to the manufacturer's protocol with Effectene Reagent™ from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and a reporter plasmid containing the lactogenic hormone response region linked to firefly luciferase (LHRR-luciferase) as well as a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter commercially available from Promega Biotech and kindly provided by Dr. Theodorescu (Department of Urology, University of Virginia). The LHRR contains two copies of the STAT5 consensus sequence from the bovine β-casein gene (AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAAATC) as described (32Silva C., Lu, H. Day R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Renillaluciferase expression was used as a normalization control for transfection. Transfected cells (5 × 104/well) were plated in 96-well plates and treated for 24 h with control (serum free) medium or 100 ng/ml rhEGF. Lysates were prepared by means of a Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system from Promega (Madison, WI), and firefly and Renilla luciferases were measured sequentially from each sample using a Packard Topcount. Firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase values in each cell sample. The pcDNA3 expression vectors (Invitrogen) for wild type (WT) and the mutant Y845F EGFR have been described previously (15Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol.

Beguinot (Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy). A vector containing a cytomegalovirus promoter and the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope upstream of a unique NotI site was used to construct the HA-tagged STAT5b expression vector as previously described (29Silva C.M. Kloth M.T. Kawecki M.A. Catling A.D. Proceedings of the 80th Annual Endocrine Society Meeting, June 24–27, New Orleans, LA. The Endocrine Society, Bethesda, MD1998: 1-119Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) and either WT, Y845F, or K721A EGFR expression plasmid plus the expression vector for HA-tagged STAT5b. After 36 h in serum-free medium, cells were treated for 15 min with either medium alone or 100 ng/ml rhEGF. Lysates were prepared, and anti-HA immunoprecipitates were analyzed as described above. Alternatively, MCF-7 cells were transfected with EGFR expression plasmids plus the LHRR-luciferase reporter plasmid (described above). After overnight incubation in serum-containing medium, cells were treated for 24 h in serum-free media without or with 100 ng/ml EGF. Cells were lysed (as above), and luciferase activity was determined using a Berthold single tube luminometer. Replicates of three were done for each treatment group, and values were normalized per microgram of protein. MEFs from STAT5a/5b knockout mice were also transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (as above). Plasmids encoding WT EGFR, STAT5b constructs, and, in some experiments, kinase active (K+) or kinase defective (K−) c-Src were transiently transfected into MEF cells. After 48 h, cells were treated for 15 min with medium alone (control) or 100 ng/ml EGF. Detergent lysates were prepared as described above. Exogeneously expressed STAT5b protein was immunoprecipitated from the lysates using our anti-STAT5b antibody. Dominant negative HA-tagged STAT5b was engineered by inserting a stop codon at amino acid 748 of the WT STAT5b expression plasmid, resulting in a 39-amino acid C-terminal truncation in the transactivation domain of STAT5b (29Silva C.M. Kloth M.T. Kawecki M.A. Catling A.D. Proceedings of the 80th Annual Endocrine Society Meeting, June 24–27, New Orleans, LA. The Endocrine Society, Bethesda, MD1998: 1-119Google Scholar). C-terminally truncated forms of STAT5b have been shown to inhibit transcriptional activation by WT STAT5b (29Silva C.M. Kloth M.T. Kawecki M.A. Catling A.D.

HA-tagged forms of WT STAT5b or dominant negative STAT5b were transfected into K+c-Src cells using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or into SKBR3 cells using FUGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were incubated in a humidified, 37 °C, 5% CO2 plus 95% air environment for 24 h and then serum-starved for 30 h prior to the addition of 100 μm 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and 100 ng/ml EGF treatment for an additional 18–20 h. Following fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were incubated with the hemagglutinin-specific antibody (16B12) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch). Cells were then treated with 2n HCl for 1 h at 37 °C and incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody directed against BrdUrd (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Alternatively, fluorescein-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and anti-BrdUrd-Alexa fluoro 594 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were used for detection in the experiments with the SKBR3 cell line. Expression of the HA-tagged STAT5b and BrdUrd incorporation into DNA were visualized and scored using a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV inverted fluorescence microscope. Six human breast cancer cell lines that were characterized previously for expression level and the association between the EGFR and c-Src tyrosine kinases were analyzed for EGF-induced STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1 A, all six of the cell lines overexpress c-Src tyrosine kinase at levels between 3- and 19-fold above that found in nontumorigenic human mammary cell lines. Furthermore, all lines except the MCF-7 express detectable levels of the EGFR (Fig. 1 A). MDA-MB468, SK-BR-3, and BT-20 cells express high levels of the EGFR, whereas MDA-MB231 and BT-549 cells express slightly less. However, in all five of these lines, an EGF-induced association between the EGFR and c-Src has been demonstrated (13Biscardi J.S. Belsches A.P. Parsons S.J. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 21: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To investigate EGF-induced STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells, STAT5b immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-STAT5b antibodies (Fig. 1 B). In the five cell lines in which the EGFR is overexpressed, EGF treatment resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b. Even in BT-20 cells where STAT5b protein was barely detectable by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel), EGF-induced STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation was readily observed (Fig. 1 B, top panel). In contrast, although STAT5b protein was clearly detectable in MCF-7 cells, it was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to EGF. These results indicate that, as in other cellular models, EGF activates STAT5b in EGFR-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of c-Src in the absence of EGFR overexpression (as in MCF-7 cells) is not sufficient for EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b. In Fig. 1 C, Western blot analysis with the commercially available anti-phospho-STAT5a/5b(Tyr694/Tyr699) confirms the results seen in Fig. 1 B and demonstrates that EGF induces the phosphorylation of STAT5b at Tyr699 in this panel of cell lines. Studies in other cell systems have shown that the activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 by EGF requires the kinase activity of the EGF receptor (19Leaman D.W. Leung S., Li, X. Stark G.R.

Thus, we investigated the role of the kinase activity and Tyr845 of the EGFR in the EGF-induced activation of STAT5b in the breast tumor model. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged STAT5b and either wild type EGFR, a K721A mutation that renders the EGFR kinase inactive, or an Y845F mutant of the EGFR. Transfection of empty vector (pcDNA3.1) does not result in an EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b (Fig. 2 A), supporting the results of Fig. 1 (MCF-7 cells). However, the exogenous expression of the WT EGFR in MCF-7 cells results in an EGF-induced increase in STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, cells expressing the K721A EGFR were incapable of EGF-induced STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation. Both forms of the EGFR were expressed similarly (Fig. 2 A,inset), although K721A had a significantly decreased level of tyrosine phosphorylation (that remaining was probably due to heterodimerization with endogenous EGFR). The results shown in Fig. 2 A demonstrate that overexpression of the EGFR as well as its kinase activity is required for EGF-induced activation of STAT5b in MCF-"

It mediates the uptake of vitellogenin (Vtg) in oocyte development of oviparous animals. In this study, we cloned and characterized two forms ofOreochromis aureus VtgR. Northern analysis showed that VtgR was specifically expressed in ovarian tissues.

This major yolk precursor protein binds to vitellogenin receptor (VtgR) on the surface of oocytes and is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis (1Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4109-4115Google Scholar). A large amount of Vtg accumulates in the oocytes within a relatively short time. Once in the oocytes, Vtg is cleaved into yolk proteins, namely, lipovitellin (LV) and phosvitin, which are stored as nutrients for the developing embryo (2Deeley R.G. Mullinix D.P. Wetekam W. Kronenberg H.M. Meyers M. Eldridge J.D. Goldberger R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9060-9066Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that the amino-terminal 700 amino acids of Vtg and apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 are homologous, although the similarity is limited (3Baker M.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 1057-1060Google Scholar). Coincidentally, Vtg also binds lipids and transports them into the oocytes. The sequence and functional relationship of these two proteins support the idea that they have a common ancestor. VtgR belongs to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family (4Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Google Scholar). The members of this family bind to various ligands and are involved in lipid metabolism in both vertebrates and invertebrates. These receptors have common structural features (5Willnow T.E. Nykjaer A. Herz J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E157-E162Google Scholar, 6Herz J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 476-478Google Scholar) including (i) cysteine-rich ligand-binding repeats (LBRs), (ii) cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor precursor (EGFP)-like repeats spaced by cysteine-poor spacer regions, (iii) a single transmembrane domain, and (iv) a short carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. In addition, a short region highly enriched in serine and threonine residues may exist in some receptors. The number of LBRs varies among different receptors. LDLR contains seven LBRs, whereas very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and VtgR in vertebrates have eight LBRs. Larger receptors such as LDLR-related protein and megalin have more than 30 LBRs in several clusters (7Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Google Scholar, 8Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K.C. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Google Scholar). Each LBR consists of about 40 amino acids including 6 cysteine residues, participating in the formation of three disulfide bonds, which are crucial for its proper folding (9Koduri V. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12801-12807Google Scholar). At the carboxyl terminus of each LBR, there is a consensus acidic tripeptide, Ser-Asp-Glu (SDE). Recent structural study by NMR and x-ray diffraction analysis of LBRs 1, 2, 5, and 6 from LDLR have revealed that the side chains of many of the aspartate and glutamate residues in the consensus peptides are involved in coordinating the calcium ion into a folded calcium cage (10Bieri S. Atkins A.R. Lee H.t. Winzor D.J. Smith R. Kroon P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10994-11002Google Scholar, 11Daly N.L. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 118-122Google Scholar). The binding sites of Vtg for VtgR were presumed to be located on the lipovitellin I domain, LV1 (16Stifani S. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 882-888Google Scholar). Residue modification studies showed that lysine and arginine residues were important for binding with the acidic clusters in LBR of VtgR through ionic interactions (17Roehrkasten A. Ferenz H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1133: 160-166Google Scholar). However, new structural studies of LBR (10Bieri S. Atkins A.R. Lee H.t. Winzor D.J. Smith R. Kroon P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10994-11002Google Scholar, 11Daly N.L. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14474-14481Google Scholar, 12North C.L. Blacklow S.C.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 118-122Google Scholar) indicate that those acidic residues might not be accessible to Vtg. This necessitates a reassessment of current models for the binding of VtgR to Vtg. Because the sequences of LBRs in different receptors are highly homologous, their backbone structures are very likely to be identical (9Koduri V. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12801-12807Google Scholar). The distinct affinity to different ligands may result from differential participation of individual LBRs, for example, repeat 5 is essential for binding of apoE, and repeats 2–7 cooperatively bind apoB (18Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Google Scholar). Thus, Vtg binding may require the involvement of different LBRs of VtgR. Given the relationship among VtgR, LDLR, and VLDLR and the relationship between Vtg and apoB, the understanding of Vtg-VtgR recognition would contribute insights into the mechanism of interaction between LDLR gene family members and their ligands. Many Vtg and VtgR genes have been cloned and characterized in recent years (19Schneider W.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 166: 103-137Google Scholar). However, knowledge on Vtg-VtgR interaction remains limited. In our study, we have cloned full-length and different domains of Vtg and VtgR from tilapia and examined their interactions. Using yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays, we found that the minimal binding domain of VtgR was the first three LBRs and that there might be more than one binding site. The receptor recognizes the 84-amino acid fragment in the amino-terminal of Vtg. Site-directed mutagenesis study indicates that lysine 185 in Vtg is particularly important for electrostatic interaction with VtgR. mRNA was purified from previtellogenic ovaries of Oreochromis aureus using Oligotex Direct mRNA kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed with oligo(dT) using the Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). Two primers (A1, 5′-GTITGCAAGGCIGTIGG-3′; A2, 5′-TCCAIIAIACICGATCCTC-3′; I = inosine) designed from the consensus sequence of VtgR/VLDLR in other species such as human, mouse, rabbit, rat chicken, andXenopus were used for PCR using platinum Taqpolymerase (Invitrogen) to obtain fragment A in the EGFP-like domain. Two other fragments, fragments B and C, adjacent to and overlapping the 5′ and 3′ ends of fragment A, were obtained by PCR amplification using B1 (5′-GAGCAGTGIGGICGICAGCC-3′) and B2 (5′-GCGTTTCTCTGCTGCTCC-3′) and C1 (5′-GTGCTCCAGTCTTCAGAG-3′) and C2 (5′-ATTGCIGGITAIGTGTG-3′), respectively, as primers. The 5′- and 3′-RACE system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to obtain full-length VtgR cDNA. The primer for 3′-RACE was C1. The primers for 5′-RACE were D (5′-GCCAGTAGCAAGACGGGTAGTATG-3′) and E (5′-GCAGTTCCCATCGTCACATTTG-3′). All PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced (Fig. 1). Full-length VtgR cDNA was obtained by PCR using high-fidelity platinum Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). The total RNAs from ovary, liver, muscle, brain, spleen, and intestine were purified using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Aliquots of 20 μg of total RNAs were resolved in 1% agarose formaldehyde gel. The separated RNAs were transferred onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreenPlus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using capillary transfer. The membrane was UV-cross-linked, prehybridized in DIG Easy Hyb (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 4 h at 50 °C, and hybridized overnight at 50 °C in Easy Hyb with DIG-labeled PCR fragment B as probe. After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each at room temperature and twice in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each at 65 °C. The membrane was incubated for 1 h in blocking solution followed by a 30-min incubation in anti-DIG-AP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:10,000 in blocking solution. After incubation, the membrane was washed twice in washing buffer (100 mmmaleic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20, pH 7.5), and the hybridized band was detected by chemiluminescence (CSPD reagent; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The β-actin cDNA from zebrafish was also labeled with DIG and used as a normalization control. Approximately 500 ng each of mRNA from ovary, liver, muscle, brain, spleen, and intestine, isolated using the Oligotex Direct mRNA kit, was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) and Thermoscript reverse transcriptase. The cDNAs were amplified by PCR using 0.2 μm concentrations of C1 (5′-GTGCTCCAGTCTTCAGAG-3′) and G (5′-ATCGCGGGGTACGTGTG-3′) primers that are specific for VtgR, in a final volume of 50 μl, containing 2 units of platinum Taq DNA polymerase, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, and 1.7 mmMgCl2. The PCR reaction was carried out by incubating the samples at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Unless otherwise stated, the Vtg and VtgR insert cDNAs were generated by linker PCR using platinum Pfx polymerase. The Vtg and VtgR cDNAs were then cloned in-frame into pGADT7 and pGBKT7 yeast two-hybrid vectors (Clontech), respectively. The template cDNAs used for VtgR constructs were reverse transcription products of ovary mRNA. The cDNAs for Vtg constructs were derived from pOAVtg1 (20Lim E.H. Teo B.Y. Lam T.J. Ding J.L. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 277: 175-186Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA of VtgR flanked byNdeI-XmaI was cloned into pGBKT7 to obtain pGBK-VtgR. All sequential LBR deletion constructs were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGBKT7 to obtain the respective pGBK-LBR constructs. The VtgRs lacking the LBR domain were PCR-amplified and inserted into pGBKT7 NdeI-XmaI sites to obtain pGBK-NLBR. The full-length Vtg insert was PCR-amplified and cloned intoNdeI sites of pGADT7. The LV1 of Vtg was cloned intoNdeI-XmaI sites of pGADT7. The deletion constructs of Vtg were obtained by digesting pGADVtg with the corresponding enzymes and religating the plasmids. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the inserts. The yeast strain Y187 (Clontech) was cotransformed by the lithium acetate method with pGAD and pGBK plasmids encoding the DNA binding domain and activator fusion protein, respectively. As controls, the pGAD constructs and pGBK constructs were also cotransformed with either pGBKT7 or pGADT7 vector. The transformed yeast cells were plated on SD minimal medium (Clontech) agar plates supplemented with -Trp-Leu DO supplement (Clontech). The cultures were grown for 4 days at 30 °C, until colonies reached 1–2 mm in diameter. Three individual colonies were inoculated into SD liquid cultures for β-galactosidase assays. The β-galactosidase activities were quantified using β-galactosidase assay kits (Pierce). The absorbance of the cultures at 600 nm was recorded. Aliquots of 350 μl of each mid-log phase liquid culture were mixed with 350 μl of Y-PER reagent (Pierce), followed by 300 μl of a 1 mNa2CO3 stop solution when the yellow color appeared. As a control, 350 μl of SD medium was assayed as blank. The absorbance of each sample at 420 nm was recorded against the blank. The ligand-binding domain of VtgR was amplified by PCR and cloned into the Escherichia coliexpression vector, pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences), in-frame with GST. The cDNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 162–246 of Vtg was amplified using PCR and cloned in-frame into theNdeI-EcoRI site of expression vector pET22-b (Novagen). To facilitate cloning, these restriction sites were added to the primers in both cases. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21. The bacterial culture was grown at 25 °C to A 600 nm = 0.6–0.8 and then induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells harvested from 10 ml of culture were resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated. Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 30 min. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST or GST-LBR lysate, either with or without 2 mm DDT. The beads were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 1% Triton X-100 and then incubated with the second lysate of pET22-b or pET22b-Vtg construct. The beads were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 1% Triton X-100, and the eluates were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE. Before using cell lysates in binding assays, aliquots of each protein sample were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue to estimate protein concentrations, and sample volumes were adjusted to equalize the amounts of fusion proteins used in each assay. The QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate 3 residues in Vtg and 1 residue in VtgR. These are sites that were anticipated to contribute crucially to their interaction. The primers were designed according to the manual. The mutation reaction was carried out by incubating samples at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 18 cycles of 94 °C for 50 s, 60 °C for 50 s, and 68 °C for 28 min. After PCR, the sample was incubated with 1 μl of DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h to digest the template DNA. Five μl of reaction was used to transform the XL10-Gold competent cells. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The mutated constructs were used to transform the yeast, and the resulting interaction was analyzed by β-galactosidase assay. To clone VtgR cDNA, RT-PCR was performed based on primers designed to obtain a 688-bp fragment A in the EGFP-like domain (Fig. 1). The sequence information was used to design another two pairs of primers. By PCR, two fragments (fragments B and C) overlapping fragment A were cloned and sequenced. Fragment B was 734 bp, encompassing LBRs 5–8. Two forms of fragment C, of 580 and 520 bp, were observed in the PCR product. The corresponding amino acid sequence shows that the 580-bp cDNA has the O-linked sugar domain, which is a threonine- and serine-rich region. The 520-bp fragment lacks this region. The primers for 5′- and 3′-RACE were used to obtain the full-length cDNA sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AF514281). The analysis of cDNA sequences revealed two open reading frames of 2500 and 2560 bp, encoding 800 and 820 residues, respectively. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of VtgR to the VLDLR and VtgR from other species showed high homology. To examine the transcription of the VtgR gene, RT-PCR was carried out with C1 and G primers flanking the O-linked sugar domain. All the tissues consistently exhibited two forms of VtgR mRNA of 420 and 360 nucleotides (Fig. 2 A). The size difference between these two forms was probably attributable to the differential splicing of a short region, as observed in the comparison of the sequences of these two PCR products. By aligning with VtgR and VLDLR genes of other species, this region was found to be located in the O-linked sugar domain. Interestingly, when Northern analysis was performed using fragment B (containing LBRs 5–8) as the probe, only the ovary exhibited one transcript of VtgR mRNA of 3.3-kb nucleotides (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that the VtgR gene was transcribed in both ovarian and nonovarian tissues. However, only the ovarian VtgR mRNA is sufficiently abundant to be detectable by Northern analysis. In our study, all the RT-PCR products from different tissues share the same sequence. This result excludes the possibility that the RT-PCR amplified the LDLR that is homologous to VtgR. When fragment C was obtained from ovarian mRNA by RT-PCR, the dominant product was the one lacking the O-linked sugar domain. Additionally, in 3′-RACE, the same product was obtained (data not shown). These data indicate that the major form of VtgR in the ovary lacks the O-linked sugar domain. In chicken, the VtgR was reported to function as VLDLR/VtgR in different tissues (4Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Google Scholar). The existence of VtgR mRNA in nonovarian tissues suggests that this receptor may function as VLDLR or VtgR in different piscine tissues. In an effort to locate the important interactive domains between VtgR and Vtg, we first examined the interactions between full-length Vtg and different domains of VtgR using yeast two-hybrid assays to confirm that the yeast two-hybrid assay is suitable for the study of interaction between Vtg and VtgR. Although two forms of VtgR were identified in the ovary, the results indicate that the major form lacks the O-linked sugar domain. Therefore, the VtgR constructs used in the interaction studies were from the VtgR lacking O-linked sugar domain. Three constructs of VtgR, full-length VtgR, the extracellular part of VtgR, and the LBR of VtgR, were tested for binding to Vtg. The quantitative β-galactosidase assay confirms the binding of the ligand-binding domain of VtgR or extracellular part of VtgR to full-length Vtg in vivo (Fig. 3). However, full-length VtgR did not show binding with full-length Vtg. This may be due to hindrance by the transmembrane domain on the transportation of VtgR fusion protein into the nucleus, where the interaction-dependent activation of reporter gene transcription occurs in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Although some earlier studies have indicated that the EGFP-like domain might be required for ligand binding (21van der Westhuyzen D.R. Stein M.L. Henderson H.E. Marais A.D. Fourie A.M. Coetzee G.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 677-682Google Scholar, 22Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Nature. 1987; 326: 760-765Google Scholar), our results clearly confirm that deletion of other parts of VtgR did not disrupt the binding between LBRs and Vtg. The controls showed that the interactions were not within the fusion proteins and the activation domain or DNA-binding domain encoded by the pGADT7 or pGBKT7 vector. These data suggest that the LBR itself is sufficient for binding Vtg. The EGFP homology domain is not necessary for the receptor-ligand interaction. Therefore, further studies on the receptor focused on the LBD. To determine which subdomains of the receptor are important to Vtg binding, 25 different fragments of the VtgR ligand-binding domain were cloned into pGBKT7. The interaction between the pGBKT7-VtgR deletion constructs and pGADVtg was tested by the yeast two-hybrid assay. All the conditions used in the transformation of yeast and the enzymatic assays for all the constructs were the same. This made the yeast two-hybrid assay semiquantitative. The difference in the β-galactosidase activities most probably arose from the difference in the interaction. Five carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs of LBD, including LBR1–7, LBR1–6, LBR1–5, LBR1–4, and LBR1–3, did not disrupt the binding to Vtg. The two carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs of LBD, namely, LBR1–2 and LBR1, lost binding to Vtg (Fig. 4). When the first LBR was deleted in constructs LBR2–8, LBR 2–7, LBR 2–6, and LBR2–3, dramatic drops in the β-galactosidase activities were observed. LBR2 alone did not show significant binding to Vtg. When both the first and second LBRs were deleted, all 11 constructs lost binding of Vtg. It is therefore clear that the first three LBRs are most important for binding Vtg. Without LBR3, the construct LBR1–2 exhibited weaker interaction with Vtg. On the other hand, constructs containing only LBR3 did not bind Vtg. Similarly, the deletion of LBR1 from various combinations of LBD (viz., constructs LBR2–8, LBR2–7, LBR2–6, LBR2–4, and LBR2–3) attenuated but did not abolish the interaction with Vtg. These data indicate that the interaction between LBD and Vtg utilizes more than one LBR in the LBD. There may be individual binding sites in the first three LBRs. However, LBRs 1–3 are not mutually exclusive in their interaction with Vtg. It is possible that one single binding site is insufficient to stabilize the interaction. Thus, the minimum ligand-binding region is a combination between either LBR1 and LBR2 or LBR2 and LBR3 or LBR1 and LBR3. Thus, the region required for maximal binding of Vtg is LBRs 1, 2, and 3. To define the actual binding sites in Vtg for VtgR, seven 3′ deletion constructs of Vtg together with full-length Vtg were tested for interaction with the VtgR LBRs (Fig. 5). The LBRs interacted with full-length Vtg and interacted to different extents with the following deletion constructs: pGADVtg-ClaI (1584 amino acids), pGADVtg-XmaI (1505 amino acids), pGADLV1 (1089 amino acids), pGADVtg-BamHI (286 amino acids), and pGADVtg-EcoRI (246 amino acids). No interaction was observed with pGADVtg-SacI (162 amino acids) and pGADVtg-XhoI (52 amino acids). Deletion of Vtg upstream of 246 amino acids completely abolished its binding to VtgR. Thus, the Vtg binding site is either between amino acids 162 and 246 or between amino acids 1 and 162. The deletion from 162 to the carboxyl terminus may cause a drastic change in the conformation of the upstream region that is necessary for binding with VtgR. Therefore, to delineate the actual binding site, the amino-terminal 84-amino acid fragment (flanked by SacI and EcoRI), VtgSE, containing amino acids 162–246 was subcloned into the pGAD vector to examine its interaction with LBR. The β-galactosidase assay shows that this VtgSE fragment has a binding capacity similar to that of full-length Vtg (Fig. 6 A), thus indicating that this region contains the crucial binding site for VtgR and that deletion of other parts of Vtg does not seem to affect its binding to receptor.Figure 6Direct binding between VtgSE and VtgR is confirmed by GST pull-down assay. A, yeast two-hybrid assay of the interaction between VtgSE and the LBD of VtgR. VtgSE was fused with the activation domain (AD) and tested for interaction with the LBD of VtgR. As the positive control, the interaction between full-length Vtg and the LBD of VtgR was also assayed. B, in vitro direct binding between VtgSE and LBD shown by GST pull-down. GST-LBD was expressed in E. coli and coupled to glutathione beads with or without 2 mm dithiothreitol. After washing, the expressed VtgSE was incubated with the beads. The unbound proteins were washed away, and the bound proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Interaction between GST (without LBD) and pET22-b vector backbone was used as a negative control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether the interaction between LBD and the short fragment VtgSE is direct and to confirm the results of the yeast two-hybrid assay, the LBD and VtgSE were tested by in vitro pull-down assay. LBR and VtgSE were expressed as GST fusion protein and His fusion protein, respectively, in E. coli. The GST and GST-LBR proteins were immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with VtgSE cell lysate. After extensive washing, the elution of GST-LBR contained VtgSE, whereas the elution of GST did not (Fig. 6 B). Thus, it is clear that the LBR and VtgSE interact directly in vitro. In the presence of DDT, the GST-LBR did not bind VtgSE. This suggests that the interaction was dependent not only on the charged residues in LBRs but also on the integrity of the disulfide bonds, which are crucial for the three-dimensional structure to confer the functional LBD. By aligning the sequence of the binding site in Vtg with the apoB major binding site and the apoE binding site for LDLR (23Hospattankar A.V. Law S.W. Lackner K. Brewer H.B. Jr. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 1078-1085Google Scholar, 24Innerarity T.L. Friedlander E.J. Rall S.C., Jr. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Google Scholar), a short motif in Vtg with basic residues was observed (Fig. 7 A). This suggests that vitellogenin may utilize the same mechanism as apoB and apoE to bind the VtgR. To test this hypothesis, we mutated the positively charged amino acids at His182, Lys185, and Lys187 in VtgSE into alanine. These residues are correspondingly important in apoB and apoE for binding to their respective receptors. We examined the effect on binding of VtgR by yeast two-hybrid assay. The mutation constructs VtgSE(H182A) and VtgSE(K187A) showed similar binding of LBD and LBR1–3. However, the binding between the mutation construct VtgSE(K185A) and either LBD or LBR1–3 is attenuated (Fig. 8). This result highlights the importance of the residue Lys185 in the interaction between Vtg and VtgR.Figure 8The effect of mutation in Vtg on its interaction with VtgR. Different mutation constructs were fused with the activation domain (AD), and the interactions between the mutation constructs and LBD containing LBR1–8 or LBR1–3 were examined. The mutation K185A attenuated the interaction. This indicates that the positively charged Lys185 is important for the Vtg-VtgR interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When the sequences of different VtgR LBRs were aligned (Fig. 7 C), the signature sequences of the LDLR superfamily emerged as well conserved.

On the other hand, increased Ca2+ release from the ER in mutant PS1 neurons, as induced by thapsigargin, was clearly dependent on the presence of APP and its processing by PS1,i.e. on the generation of the amyloid peptides and the APP C99 fragments. This observation was corroborated by the thapsigargin-induced increase in cytosolic [Ca2+]i in PS1 deficient neurons, which accumulate C99 fragments due to deficient γ-secretase activity. Moreover, co-expression of mutant APP[V717I] in PS1-deficient neurons further increased the apparent size of the ER calcium stores in parallel with increasing levels of the APP processing products. We conclude that mutant PS1 deregulates neuronal calcium homeostasis by two different actions: (i) direct attenuation of CCE at the cell-surface independent of APP; and (ii) indirect increase of ER-calcium stores via processing of APP and generation of amyloid peptides and C99 fragments.

Most familial forms of AD are caused by a mutation in presenilin-1 (PS1) (for review, see 3). Mutant PS1 increases the production of amyloid peptides by γ-secretase cleavage of APP, an activity for which PS1 is essential (4De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G.

The mechanisms by which mutant PS1 deregulates neuronal calcium homeostasis are not known, but the relation of a perturbed flux of calcium ions to the alteration in APP processing, or vice versa, is debated or questioned as an essential element in the pathogenic processes (5, 6, 7 and references therein).Here, we have analyzed cellular mechanisms in neurons that were derived from six different types of single and multiple transgenic or gene-ablated mice. We analyzed, for the first time, neurons that express a mutant PS1 on a wild-type and an APP-deficient background, and in addition we analyzed the effect of a mutant APP expressed in wild-type and in PS1-deficient neurons. First and foremost, we demonstrate here that CCE is normal in the absence of APP, whereas APP deficiency did not correct the attenuated CCE provoked by mutant PS1. These findings implicate PS1 directly in CCE, independent of its activity as γ-secretase on APP. We further measured and compared the thapsigargin-induced increase in [Ca2+]i as a measure of ER calcium stores in neurons from the six different transgenic mouse strains, including mice with a neuronal deficiency in PS1, i.e. PS1 (n−/−) crossed with APP[V717I] mice (9Dewachter I.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that the increase in ER calcium stores in neurons is due to increased processing of APP into amyloid peptides and C99 fragments.DISCUSSIONAlthough the normal physiological functions of both APP and PS1 and their intricate relationship are still unclear and heavily debated, the evidence that mutant presenilins generate more hydrophobic amyloid peptides is accepted (for reviews, see Refs. 22Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 23Selkoe D.J. Neurol.

The final step in the processing of APP and the generation of the amyloid peptides is γ-secretase cleavage, for which PS1 is essential (4De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). The primary pathogenic changes in AD have been attributed to the amyloid peptides, and different mechanisms have been proposed to explain their effect on neurons and their role in neurodegeneration and dementia.Disturbed neuronal calcium ion homeostasis could play a subordinate but also an essential role in the neurodegeneration that causes AD (for reviews, see Refs. 2Mattson M.P.

We have now addressed these questions directly by comparatively analyzing neurons derived from six different transgenic mouse strains expressing either mutant PS1 or mutant APP on APP- or PS1-deficient backgrounds (Table I).First, we present experimental evidence that APP is not directly involved in CCE or ER-based calcium ion storage, a finding with major implications for the physiological function of APP. In contradiction to results obtained in fibroblasts derived from APP−/− mice (27Leissring M.A. Murphy M.P. Mead T.R. Akbari Y. Sugarman M.C. Jannatipour M. Anliker B. Müler U. Saftig P., De Strooper B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), we did not observe any alterations in cultured hippocampal neurons from APP−/− mice in response to thapsigargin or bradykinin. By analyzing CCE in double transgenic mice that express the mutant PS1 on an APP−/− background, we observed that the attenuation of CCE by mutant PS1 is not dependent on the expression of APP (Table I). The attenuation of CCE by mutant PS1 must then be due to a direct interference with the mechanism of CCE that is independent of APP and APP-cleavage and hence independent of the γ-secretase activity of PS1. The conclusion that a normal physiological function of PS1 is to be sought in the regulation of CCE and the refilling of the ER-calcium stores could be structurally explained if PS1 participates in the formation of a channel within the plasma and/or ER-membrane that mediates calcium ion movements. This proposition finds strong support in the fact that PS1 is present at the cell surface (28Dewji N.N. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which was most recently and convincingly confirmed and functionally extended to other partners, i.e. nicastrin (29Kaether C. Lammich S. Edbauer D. Ertl M. Rietdorf J. Capell A. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The implication of a close and intricate structural relationship of the plasma and ER membranes in neurons to the function of neuronal signaling and calcium homeostasis as well as in terms of the possible contribution to the molecular basis of memory and neurodegeneration was proposed and discussed extensively (Refs. 8Blaustein M.P. Golovina V.A. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 602-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Alkon D. Neslon T.J. Zhao W. Cavallero S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar, and references therein). There is clearly a need for the experimental demonstration that PS1 takes part in a novel structural entity linking the plasma and the ER membranes to establish the molecular identity of the proposed structures now diversely known as “plasmerosomes” or “store-operated channels” (Refs. 8Blaustein M.P. Golovina V.A. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 602-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Alkon D. Neslon T.J. Zhao W. Cavallero S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar, and references therein). Evidently in this respect as in many others, neurons are structurally and functionally much more complex and differently organized than fibroblasts or other simple cell types. This may explain the divergent results we obtained here in APP−/− neurons relative to APP−/− fibroblasts (27Leissring M.A. Murphy M.P. Mead T.R. Akbari Y. Sugarman M.C. Jannatipour M. Anliker B. Müler U. Saftig P., De Strooper B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).In contrast to the direct attenuation of CCE by mutant PS1, we present robust evidence that the increase of ER-based calcium stores by mutant PS1 indeed requires the expression of APP. In the double transgenic mice that express mutant PS1 on the APP−/− background, the deficit in ER calcium signaling was restored to normal values. This result evidently excludes the possibility that APP-dependent alterations in ER calcium signaling are responsible for the depression of CCE by mutant PS1, as proposed (5Leissring M.A. Akbari Y. Fanger C.M. Cahalan M.D. Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The argument that higher levels of ER calcium ions in PS1 mutant cells would impair CCE by preventing the agonists from depleting the intracellular calcium stores beyond a threshold required to activate CCE (5Leissring M.A. Akbari Y. Fanger C.M. Cahalan M.D. Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) is contradicted by our finding that CCE is still attenuated by mutant PS1 in the APP−/− double transgenic mice, whereas the filling of ER-calcium stores is not altered in the absence of APP (Table I).It is clear that the thapsigargin-sensitive calcium ion movements in mutant PS1 neurons are dependent on the presence of APP, leading to the conclusion that this involves the γ-secretase activity of PS1 and therefore the proteolytical fragments of APP, i.e. amyloid peptides and their obligatory precursors, the C99 fragments. The analysis of PS1-deficient neurons yielded, to our surprise, similar alterations in ER calcium storage as observed in mutant PS1 neurons. Because amyloid peptide production is very low in PS1−/− neurons (4De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K.

The relative changes in the size of the ER-calcium ion stores sensitive to thapsigargin correlate very well with the relative changes in the level of the amyloid and C99 fragments in the brains of the mice analyzed (Table I, right panel) (9Dewachter I.

Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 26Kim H.S. Park C.H. Cha S.H. Lee J.H. Lee S. Kim Y. Rah J.C. Jeong S.J. Suh Y.H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein). Most recently, we have obtained the first indications for the same effect in vivoin adult mice that lack neuronal PS1 (9Dewachter I. Reversé D. Caluwaerts N. Ris L. Kuipéri C. Van den Haute C. Spittaels K. Umans L. Serneels L. Thiry E. Moechars D. Mercken M. Godaux E. Van Leuven F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, how the amyloid and C99 fragments disturb the ER-based calcium ion stores. In transfected cells, the C57 fragment of APP appeared to induce similar alterations in ER calcium stores as the C99 fragment (27Leissring M.A. Murphy M.P. Mead T.R. Akbari Y. Sugarman M.C. Jannatipour M. Anliker B. Müler U. Saftig P., De Strooper B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the C57 fragments interact with the nuclear adaptor protein Fe65, which, in turn, interacts with transcription factors (31Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar,32Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30853-30866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This would mean that alterations in ER calcium storage in PS1 transgenic mice are due to transcriptional effects of the C57 intracellular cleavage product of APP, i.e. the APP intracellular domain (AICD), in complete analogy to the modes of generation and action of the intracellular cleavage product of Notch (NICD) (31Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Although AICD was below detection limits in the brains of the transgenic mice studied here (results not shown), we can evidently not rule them out. Conversely, we observed increased ER calcium ion storage in PS1−/− neurons in which the generation of AICD is strongly inhibited. This contradicts results obtained by others in fibroblasts (27Leissring M.A. Murphy M.P. Mead T.R. Akbari Y. Sugarman M.C. Jannatipour M. Anliker B. Müler U. Saftig P., De Strooper B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and primary neurons derived from conventional PS1-knockout mice (6Yoo A.S. Cheng I. Chung S. Grenfell T.Z. Lee H. Pack-chung E. Handler M. Shen J. Xia W. Tesco G. Saunders A.J. Ding K. Frosch M.P. Tanzi R.E. Kim T.W. Neuron. 2000; 27: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Possible factors contributing to this discrepancy include the fact that the latter PS1−/− neurons were derived from embryonic tissues from total PS1 knockout mice, whereas we derived primary neuronal cultures from postnatal conditional PS1 knockout mice in which the floxed PS1 gene is inactivated by coexpressed Cre recombinase driven by the thy1 gene promoter (9Dewachter I. Reversé D. Caluwaerts N. Ris L. Kuipéri C. Van den Haute C. Spittaels K. Umans L. Serneels L. Thiry E. Moechars D. Mercken M. Godaux E. Van Leuven F. J.

However, here we also analyzed the response to thapsigargin in a different experimental setting,i.e. in hippocampal slices derived from adult PS1(n−/−) mice and demonstrated a very similar effect as in the postnatal primary cultured neurons.The most direct explanation of the similar results we obtained in neurons that either express mutant PS1 or are deficient in PS1 would be that the gain of function of mutant PS1 leads to increased levels of the AICD or C57 fragments, whereas the loss of function of PS1 increases the C99 fragments. But then we must accept that the C99 and the C57 fragments act similarly with respect to calcium homeostasis, which could be at the transcriptional level. This requires additional experimental definition of the mechanisms involved in both types of genetically modified neurons.The problem of whether and how alterations in neuronal calcium homeostasis relate to loss of synaptic functions and eventually to nerve cell loss in Alzheimer's disease has been speculated upon before (for a review, see Ref. 2Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Based on results from experiments performed with fibroblasts (33Gibson G.E. Vestling M. Zhang H. Szolosi S. Alkon D. Lannfelt L. Gandy S. Cowburn R.F. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and lymphocytes (34Eckert A. Forstl H. Zerfass R. Hennerici M. Muller W.E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) from AD patients carrying a mutant PS1 gene, it was proposed that neurons in these patients might suffer from alterations in ER calcium ion homeostasis well before the patients develop the mental disorder. Alterations in intracellular free calcium concentration have also been implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases, i.e. prion disease (35Johnston A.R. Fraser J.R. Jeffrey M. MacLeod N. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 151: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (36Vanselow B.K. Keller B.U. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) as well as normal aging (37Thibault O. Hadley R. Landfield P.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9744-9756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In conclusion, we analyzed neurons derived from the six most relevant single and combined transgenic and gene-deficient mouse strains to demonstrate that altered neuronal calcium dynamics caused by mutant PS1 are dual in nature. First, the hypothesis that mutant PS1 attenuates CCE directly, independent of APP as proposed (6Yoo A.S. Cheng I. Chung S. Grenfell T.Z. Lee H. Pack-chung E. Handler M. Shen J. Xia W. Tesco G. Saunders A.J. Ding K. Frosch M.P. Tanzi R.E. Kim T.W. Neuron. 2000; 27: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), is now proven by the data presented here. Secondly, as opposed to CCE, the increase of ER-calcium stores by mutant PS1 is found to be dependent on APP and is correlated closely with the combination of changes in the levels of the amyloid peptides and the C99 fragments of APP. How these fragments alter ER-calcium stores is a matter of debate. The C99 fragments might act either directly and similarly to the amyloid peptides, or they might be further degraded and act like the APP intracellular domain AICD (27Leissring M.A. Murphy M.P. Mead T.R. Akbari Y. Sugarman M.C. Jannatipour M. Anliker B. Müler U. Saftig P., De Strooper B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Our observations do not lead to a complete understanding of the normal physiological roles of APP and PS1, which are clearly much more complex and diverse than anticipated from the pathological consequences of their malfunction. Conceivably, the pathogenic consequences of perturbed calcium homeostasis also offer possibilities for therapeutic approaches. Conversely, the possible benefits of using γ-secretase inhibitors for the treatment of AD are seriously challenged by the current and previous results, as these inhibitors will disturb neuronal calcium homeostasis by increasing the levels of the N-terminal fragments of APP (9Dewachter I.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of amyloid peptides (Aβ40/42) by proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)1 is proposed to be central to the pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (1Kang J. Lemaire H. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Müller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). The amyloid peptides are neurotoxic and alter calcium ion homeostasis (for review, see Ref. 2Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Most familial forms of AD are caused by a mutation in presenilin-1 (PS1) (for review, see 3). Mutant PS1 increases the production of amyloid peptides by γ-secretase cleavage of APP, an activity for which PS1 is essential (4De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). In addition, however, mutant PS1 deregulates intracellular calcium homeostasis by increasing the apparent intracellular pools of Ca2+ and decreasing capacitative calcium entry (CCE) (Refs. 5Leissring M.A. Akbari Y.

CCE is a refill mechanism allowing entry of extracellular calcium ions through plasma membrane channels that are tightly regulated by and even physically linked to intracellular stores (for review, see Ref. 8Blaustein M.P.

The mechanisms by which mutant PS1 deregulates neuronal calcium homeostasis are not known, but the relation of a perturbed flux of calcium ions to the alteration in APP processing, or vice versa, is debated or questioned as an essential element in the pathogenic processes (5, 6, 7 and references therein). Here, we have analyzed cellular mechanisms in neurons that were derived from six different types of single and multiple transgenic or gene-ablated mice. We analyzed, for the first time, neurons that express a mutant PS1 on a wild-type and an APP-deficient background, and in addition we analyzed the effect of a mutant APP expressed in wild-type and in PS1-deficient neurons. First and foremost, we demonstrate here that CCE is normal in the absence of APP, whereas APP deficiency did not correct the attenuated CCE provoked by mutant PS1. These findings implicate PS1 directly in CCE, independent of its activity as γ-secretase on A"

The TCDD·AhR complex mediates a wide range of biological responses in rodents, such as a wasting syndrome, hepatotoxicity, teratogenesis, and tumor promotion. The unliganded AhR exists in cytosolic extracts as a core tetrameric complex, composed of a ligand binding subunit (AhR), a dimer of hsp90, and the immunophilin homolog XAP2 (4Perdew G.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Chen H.S. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27554-27558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Meyer B.K. Pray-Grant M.G. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Perdew G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Upon binding ligand, the AhR translocates to the nucleus where it forms a heterodimer with ARNT, concurrent with the loss of hsp90 from the complex (7McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The AhR·ARNT heterodimer is capable of regulating transcription of a number of genes, such as CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase, upon binding to DREs in their enhancer regions. The ability of XAP2 to interact with the AhR was originally established independently by three laboratories (6Meyer B.K. Pray-Grant M.G. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Perdew G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 8Ma Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. J. Biol.

XAP2, also referred to as AIP (for AhR-interacting protein), or ARA9 (for AhR-associated protein 9), is a tetratricopeptide repeat motif domain containing immunophilin homolog that has significant sequence homology with FKBP52. The immunophilin FKBP52 is found bound to hsp90 and also exists in larger complexes with certain steroid receptors, including the glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors (10Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have established that XAP2 is able to stabilize and enhance cellular levels of the mAhR (11Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8907-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which may occur through protection from proteolysis (12Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, FKBP52 was unable to modulate AhR levels (13Meyer B.K. Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transient expression of XAP2 also leads to sequestration of the mAhR in the cytoplasm (12Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Petrulis J.R. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. J. Biol.

Regulation of intracellular movement of the AhR both in the presence and absence of ligand is a potentially important aspect of Ah receptor function that warrants further investigation. For many proteins larger than 40 kDa, import or export across the nuclear envelope is controlled by the presence of nuclear localization sequences (NLS) and leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES). An NLS is usually a short cluster of basic amino acids, such as those found in SV40 large T antigen, or it can be two clusters of basic amino acids separated by 10–12 amino acids, known as a bipartite NLS (16Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The NLS is recognized by importin α, and this complex is then recognized by importin β, which mediates docking of the ternary complex to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex. However, importin β is capable of binding directly to arginine-rich NLS of a number of proteins and mediate nuclear import (17Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 76-83Crossref Google Scholar, 18Brownawell A.M. Kops G.J. Macara I.G. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3534-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The NES are short, hydrophobic, leucine-rich amino acid sequences (XLXXLXXLXLX) and are found in a variety of proteins (e.g. p53, IκBα, and glucocorticoid receptor). In the nucleus chromosomal region maintenance protein 1 (CRM-1) binds to the NES, followed by cooperative binding of RanGTP, which results in a complex competent for export (17Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 76-83Crossref Google Scholar). Proteins that carry both an NLS and NES often dynamically shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus by a process termed nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In these cases, the relative localization seen is the result of the relative rate of import and export combined. Shuttling provides a rapid and reversible means to regulate protein localization through protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, or other post-translational modifications, in the microenvironment of the cytoplasm or nucleus. An example is the regulation of FKHRL1, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors, which is retained in the cytoplasm after Akt phosphorylation and subsequent 14-3-3 protein binding (18Brownawell A.M. Kops G.J. Macara I.G. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3534-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A bipartite NLS between amino acid residues 13 and 39 of the human AhR (hAhR) has been identified using a GFP fusion protein expression system (19Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, a NES has been identified between residues 55 and 75 in helix 2 of the helix-loop-helix domain of the hAhR and has been shown to interact with CRM-1 (20Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Watanabe J. Yoshida M. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Considering that the AhR has both a NLS and a NES, it is not surprising that it can undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling; indeed, this has been demonstrated through the use of the nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin, and microinjection techniques (20Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Watanabe J. Yoshida M. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Richter C.A. Tillitt D.E. Hannink M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 389: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Kazlauskas A. Sundstrom S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The primary objective of the studies presented here was to examine the mechanism of cytoplasmic retention of the mAhR in the presence of XAP2. The initial observation in this study indicated that XAP2 effectively blocks ligand-independent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. There are a number of hypothetical mechanisms that could explain the ability of XAP2 to retain the mAhR in the cytoplasm. The most likely hypotheses are that XAP2 blocks importin access to the NLS, XAP2 locks the bipartite NLS of AhR into an unfavorable conformation for importin binding, XAP2 sequesters the mAhR in the cytoplasm by binding to cytoskeletal matrix proteins, or XAP2 may enhance nuclear export, leading to apparent cytoplasmic localization. The results outlined in this report demonstrate that XAP2·mAhR complexes are not sequestered in the cytoplasm through docking on tubulin or actin filaments. In addition, any other type of anchoring seems unlikely, as XAP2 did not promote sequestration of mAhR-YFP-Nuc, which contains a NLS distinct from the one present in the native receptor. Interestingly, XAP2 prevented active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the mAhR, which would suggest that XAP2 may block the NLS or alter the conformation of the bipartite NLS. Antibodies directed against the NLS were capable of binding to mAhR·XAP2 complexes, indicating that the NLS of mAhR is not blocked by the presence of XAP2. However, XAP2 does reduce importin β binding to the mAhR·hsp90 complex in vitro. These studies taken together would suggest that XAP2 alters the ability of importin β to recognize the bipartite NLS sequence of the mAhR, and this appears to be the primary mechanism of XAP2-mediated redistribution of the mAhR to the cytoplasm. Another hypothesis that we wanted to test is whether blocking of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling could lead to a repression of AhR transcriptional activity. Transient transfection experiments indicated that XAP2 is capable of repressing AhR activity. In summary, these studies would suggest that XAP2 cause a functionally significant alteration in the conformation of the mAhR. The vector pcDNA3-βmAhR provided by Oliver Hankinson (University of California, Los Angeles, CA) was used for mammalian expression of the mouse AhR (23Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3743-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As a control for importin binding experiments, amino acid residues 13–15 of the mAhR were mutated to alanine residues using pcDNA3-βmAhR and a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The vector was designed as pcDNA3- βmAhR/M-NLS. The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the amino acids 31–44 of the mAhR/FLAG was deleted using a site-directed mutagenesis approach. Two alanine residues were inserted between amino acids 30 and 45, and this construct was designated as pcDNA3- βmAhR/FLAG/ΔNLS. The plasmids pEYFP-N1, pEYFP-actin, pEYFP-tubulin, pEYFP-Nuc, and pECFP-Nuc were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The pCI-XAP2, pCI-XAP2-FLAG, and pCI-XAP2-G272D-FLAG vectors were previously prepared in our laboratory (11Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The pEYFP-mAhR and pEYFP-mAhR-K13A were constructed as previously described (14Petrulis J.R. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37448-37453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The pEYFP-mAhR-YFP-Nuc and pEYFP-mAhR-K13A-YFP-Nuc were constructed by excising mAhR-YFP and mAhR-K13A-YFP from the vectors described above with NheI andBsrGI and inserted directly into theNheI/BsrGI sites of pEYFP-Nuc. The DRE-driven reporter vector pGudLuc 6.1 was obtained from Mike Denison (University of California, Davis, CA). Human importin β-myc-pET30a and GST-importin β and α constructs were obtained from Stephen Adam (Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL). Cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. Fluorescence micrographs were obtained directly from cells grown in six-well microplates that were transfected with 1.5 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE with PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Approximately 18 h following transfection, fluorescence was visualized with a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope with TE-FM epifluorescence attachment using a Nikon Pan Fluor 60X objective and a SPOT RT Color model 2.2.0 cooled CCD camera. For examination of cytoskeletal disruption, cells grown on glass cover slips in six-well culture dishes were transfected with 2 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Approximately 18 h after transfection, cells were treated with either 5 μm colchicine or 10 μmcytochalasin B (Sigma) for 1 h. Before visualization, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4% formaldehyde/PBS at room temperature, and rinsed twice with PBS, and inverted coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence micrographs were obtained with a SPOT SP100 cooled CCD camera fitted to a Nikon Optiphot-2 upright microscope with EFD-3 episcopic fluorescence attachment using a Nikon Pan Fluor 100× oil immersion objective. All cells in micrographs are representative of >80% of the transfected cell population. A 15-residue peptide corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the bipartite NLS of the AhR (amino acids 31–44) (19Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) was synthesized with an N-terminal cysteine residue (H2N-CKSNPSKRHRDRLNT-COOH) by New England Peptide (Fitchburg, MA). The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits using standard techniques at New England Peptide. The AhR-NLS peptide (1 mg) was conjugated to 3 ml of Sulfolink resin (Pierce) following the instructions from the manufacturer. A 3-ml column was washed and stored at 4 °C in M/N buffer (20 mm MOPS, 0.02% sodium azide) until use. Affinity purification was carried out entirely at 4 °C. Before use, the column was washed with three volumes of ice-cold M/N buffer. Rabbit serum (6 ml) was applied to the column by gravity flow, collected, and reapplied. The column was then washed as follows: 10 volumes of M/N, 5 volumes of M/N + 500 mm NaCl, and 2 volumes of M/N. The antibody was eluted with two volumes of 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, and 1-ml fractions were collected into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 100 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Protein content of fractions was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). The specificity of this peptide antibody was assessed by in vitro translating pcDNA3- βmAhR/FLAG and pcDNA3-βmAhR/FLAG/ΔNLS in the presence of [35S]methionine, which were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane. The presence of the AhR was visualized using either mAb RPT 1 or anti-AhR-NLS peptide antibody and goat anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate. The ability of the anti-AhR-NLS polyclonal antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose to immunoprecipitatein vitro translated mAhR/FLAG or mAhR/FLAG/ΔNLS was assessed using standard techniques. Transfected COS-1 cells grown in 100-mm plates were harvested by trypsinization, rinsed with PBS, and mechanically homogenized with 30 strokes of a stainless steel Dounce homogenizer. Immunoprecipitations were carried out for 1 h at 4 °C in IP buffer (MENG (25 mm MOPS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4) with 20 mm sodium molybdate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mg/ml ovalbumin), using rabbit polyclonal anti-AhR-NLS antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates were rinsed three times with IP buffer, twice with wash buffer (MENG with 20 mm sodium molybdate, 50 mm NaCl), resolved by Tricine SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as previously described (13Meyer B.K. Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The AhR and XAP2 were visualized by Western blot analysis using RPT1 mAb (24Perdew G.H. Abbott B. Stanker L.H. Hybridoma. 1995; 14: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and anti-ARA9 mAb (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), respectively. Primary antibodies were detected with either125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or125I-labeled donkey anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG (AmershamBiosciences), visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated with a phosphorimager. COS-1 cells in three 100-mm dishes were transfected with pcDNA3-βmAhR/FLAG, with pcDNA3- βmAhR/FLAG and pCI-XAP2, or with pcDNA3-βmAhR/FLAG-M-NLS (as a importin specificity control) using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM transfection method as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After 24 h cells were trypsinized and washed three times with PBS. Cells from each set of three plates were lysed in 1 ml of MENG containing 20 mmNaMoO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm DTT for 15 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate (∼350 μl) was treated with TCDD to a final concentration of 10 nm or Me2SO for 30 min at ambient temperature followed by 10 min on ice. To the TCDD- or Me2SO-treated lysate 350 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (MENG containing 20 mm NaMoO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mg/ml ovalbumin, 1 mm DTT) was added and then transferred to 25 μl of pre-washed anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). The immunoprecipitations were incubated with agitation for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with MENG containing 100 mm NaCl and 20 mmNaMoO4. The FLAG-tagged proteins were displaced by incubating with 200 μg of FLAG peptide (Sigma) in 125 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min at ambient temperature. The displacement was repeated once more, and supernatants were pooled. Each of the displaced FLAG-tagged proteins (200 μl) was transferred into 200 μl of importin-binding buffer (PBS containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mg/ml ovalbumin, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT), and 22 μg of GST-importin β was added. The mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice, transferred to 25 μl of pre-washed glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), incubated with agitation for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed three times with 1 ml of PBS. GST-importin β was displaced from the resin by incubating with 80 μl of 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 1 mm DTT for 5 min at ambient temperature. The displacement was repeated once more, and the pooled supernatant was subjected to Tricine SDS-PAGE. Protein was transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as previously described. The mAhR, XAP2, and GST-importin β were visualized by protein blot analysis using mAb RPT1, mAb anti-ARA9 (Novus Biologicals), and mAb B-14 anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Primary antibodies were detected with125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated with a phosphorimager and/or a γ counter. COS-1 cells (100-mm dishes) were transfected with pcDNA3, pcDNA3-βmAhR/FLAG, or pcDNA-βmAhR/FLAG and pCI-XAP2 using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM transfection method as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After 24 h cells were harvested and lysed in MENG + 20 mm sodium molybdate + 1% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were transferred to three tubes, each containing 50 μl of M2-agarose (Sigma), and incubated with agitation for 90 min. The immunoprecipitations were washed twice with MENG + 20 mmsodium molybdate, followed by two additional washes with 20 mm MOPS, 50 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4 (binding buffer). The human importin β-myc-pET30a construct was transcribed and translated in a TnT coupled translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. To the immunoprecipitates 5 μl of in vitro translated importin β and 45 μl of binding buffer was added. Each sample incubated for 20 min at 30 °C and gently mixed every 5 min, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 45 min. The immunoprecipitates were washed quickly three times and incubated with 50 μl of FLAG peptide (5 mg/ml), and these mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation the FLAG peptide-displaced AhR-FLAG present in the supernatant was collected. This displacement was repeated once more and the pooled supernatants subjected to Tricine SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane, and the presence of [35S]methionine-labeled importin β was visualized and quantitated by phosphorimaging. The presence of XAP2 and AhR was detected using the monoclonal antibodies described above and peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. The presence of peroxidase was visualized with a Vector VIP peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). COS-1 cells in 100-mm plates were co-transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM (Invitrogen) with 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-βmAhR, 100 ng of luciferase reporter construct pGudLuc 6.1, 30 ng of pCMV-βGalactosidase, either 2 or 4 μg of pCI-XAP2, and pCI was added for a total of 8 μg of DNA. Transfected cells after 9 h were transferred to 12-well plates; 13 h later cells were treated with iodoflavone. Cells were lysed after an 8-h exposure to ligand, and reporter activity was assayed using a Turner TD-20e luminometer and a luciferase assay system (Promega). COS-1 cells were utilized in this study because of their ability to be transfected with greater than 50% transfection efficiency; additionally, they have low levels of endogenous AhR, and our previous studies examining regulation of mAhR localization were performed in this cell line (14Petrulis J.R. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37448-37453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pEYFP-mAhR, pEYFP-mAhR + XAP2, or pEYFP-mAhR-K13A (containing a single point mutation that renders the NLS nonfunctional) and treated with either vehicle (MeOH) or 10 nm leptomycin B (Fig. 1). As previously reported (14Petrulis J.R. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37448-37453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), control-treated cells expressing mAhR-YFP showed localization of the receptor throughout cells, with a higher level in cell nuclei than in the cytoplasm. Co-expression of XAP2 resulted in redistribution of the wild-type receptor to the cytoplasm, whereas mAhR-K13A-YFP is cytoplasmic with or with out co-expression of XAP2 (19Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Treatment with leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of CRM-1-mediated nuclear export, resulted in enhanced nuclear accumulation of mAhR-YFP, suggesting that the unliganded receptor is capable of undergoing nucleocytoplasmic shuttling as has previously been suggested using N-terminal fragments of the human AhR fused to glutathione S-transferase and GFP (20Ikuta T. Tachibana T. Watanabe J. Yoshida M. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling was eliminated by mutation of the NLS of the AhR, but quite unexpectedly, co-expression of XAP2 with mAhR-YFP also resulted in inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. When XAP2 was co-expressed with mAhR-YFP and cells treated with leptomycin B, nuclear accumulation was not observed after 1 h (Fig. 1), and little or no increase in nuclear accumulation was seen at the longest observed time point of 6 h (data not shown). Inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the mAhR by XAP2 suggests that the observed effect of XAP2 on mediating cytoplasmic retention of mAhR-YFP is not caused by either an enhanced rate of nuclear export or an inhibition of nuclear retention. This information has allowed us to narrow down the possible hypotheses to explain XAP2-mediated sequestration of the mAhR; these hypotheses are schematically represented in Fig. 2 A.Figure 2Possible mechanisms by which XAP2 may mediate cytoplasmic localization of the mAhR. A, (i) XAP2 may physically anchor the mAhR to actin/tubulin-based components of the cytoskeleton; (ii) XAP2 may physically anchor the mAhR to some unknown cytoplasmic component; (iii) XAP2 may block access to the NLS of the mAhR; (iv) XAP2 may stabilize a conformation of the receptor in which the bipartite NLS is incapable of recognition by importin molecules.B, schematic representation of mAhR constructs used to examine the role of XAP2 in mediating cytoplasmic localization of the AhR complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We hypothesized that XAP2 may sequester the mAhR in the cytoplasm through interaction with components of the cytoskeleton. To examine this possibility, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with either pEYFP-actin and pECFP-Nuc or pEYFP-tubulin and pECFP-Nuc, followed by treatment with either 10 μmcytochalasin B or 5 μm colchicine (Fig. 3 A). Initial experiments were conducted to (a) demonstrate specific disruption of the cytoskeleton by each agent, and (b) demonstrate that the integrity of the nuclear membrane was maintained following each treatment. The actin cytoskeleton was disrupted by 10 μmcytochalasin B, but was unaffected by 5 μm colchicine, whereas the tubulin cytoskeleton was disrupted by 5 μmcolchicine, but was unaffected by 10 μm cytochalasin B. In each case, nuclear retention of CFP-Nuc (nuclear localized cyan fluorescent protein) was preserved. COS-1 cells were next co-transfected with pEYFP-mAhR and pCI-XAP2 and subjected to treatment with cytoskeletal disruption agents in the presence and absence of TCDD (Fig. 3 B). Control cells showed mAhR-YFP localization to cell cytoplasm, whereas 1-h treatment with 10 nm TCDD resulted in nuclear uptake of the receptor. Treatment of cells with cytochalasin B or colchicine did not result in altered subcellular localization of the unliganded receptor and di"

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1 is a central component of this pathway. We found in human MDA-468 breast cancer cells that EGF up-regulates p21WAF1 mRNA and protein, through a combination of increased mRNA stability and transcription. The decay rate of a hybrid luciferase reporter full-length p21WAF13′-untranslated region (UTR) mRNA was significantly faster than that of a control mRNA. Transfections with a variety of p21WAF1 3′-UTR constructs identified multiplecis-acting elements capable of reducing basal reporter activity. Short wavelength ultraviolet light induced reporter activity in constructs containing the 5′ region of the p21WAF1 3′-UTR, whereas EGF induced reporter activity in constructs containing sequences 3′ of the UVC-responsive region. Thesecis-elements bound multiple proteins from MDA-468 cells, including HuR and poly(C)-binding protein 1 (CP1). Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that HuR and CP1 associate with p21WAF1mRNA in MDA-468 cells. Over- and underexpression of HuR in MDA-468 cells did not affect EGF-induced p21WAF1 protein expression or growth inhibition. However, binding of HuR to its target 3′-UTRcis-element was regulated by UVC but not by EGF, suggesting that these stimuli modulate the stability of p21WAF1mRNA via different mechanisms. We conclude that EGF-induced p21WAF1 protein expression is mediated largely by stabilization of p21WAF1 mRNA elicited via multiple 3′-UTR cis-elements. Although HuR binds at least one of these elements, it does not appear to be a major modulator of p21WAF1 expression or growth inhibition in this system.

Schneider C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 177-185Google Scholar), which encodes a protein of M r 21,000 (p21), also known as cyclin-dependent kinase-interacting protein 1. p21WAF1 inhibits cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase activity, preventing phosphorylation of critical cyclin-dependent kinase substrates, blocking transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (3Hengst L. Dulic V. Slingerland J.M. Lees E. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5291-5295Google Scholar), as well as inducing apoptosis (4Sheikh M.S. Rochefort H. Garcia M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1899-1905Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that factors other than p53, such as EGF1(16Johannessen L.E. Knardal S.L. Madshus I.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 337 (, (Pt 3)): 599-606Google Scholar), can induce p21WAF1 expression in various cell types (p53-independent pathways). Because most human tumors lack p53 function (5Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M. Hostetter R. Cleary K. Bigner S.H. Davidson N. Baylin S. Devilee P. et al.Nature. 1989; 342: 705-708Google Scholar), investigation of the mechanisms that regulate p21WAF1 expression through alternative growth factor-induced pathways has become an important focus in cancer research. In particular, a major goal is to devise approaches that would increase expression of p21WAF1 in tumors to reduce proliferation and tumor growth. Although EGF is typically growth-proliferative in breast cancer cells (6Davidson N.E. Gelmann E.P. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 216-223Google Scholar), some cancer cells are growth-inhibited by EGF (e.g.MDA-468 breast (7Filmus J. Pollak M.N. Cailleau R. Buick R.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EGF-induced growth inhibition of these cells is associated with EGF receptor (EGFR) overexpression (11Daly J.M. Olayioye M.A. Wong A.M. Neve R. Lane H.A. Maurer F.G. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3440-3451Google Scholar) and appears to be mediated by induction of p21WAF1 mRNA and protein (8Xie W., Su, K. Wang D. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 2627-2633Google Scholar). Multiple reports show conclusively that the regulation of p21WAF1 expression by growth factors and other ligands occurs predominantly at the level of mRNA stability (12Akashi M. Osawa Y. Koeffler H.P. Hachiya M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 607-616Google Scholar, 13Shiohara M. Akashi M. Gombart A.F. Yang R. Koeffler H.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 568-576Google Scholar, 14Li X.S.

Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Google Scholar). However, there is little understanding of the specific RNA-protein interactions involved in this process, particularly in breast cancer cells. Thus, the EGF-induced up-regulation of p21WAF1 mRNA provides an ideal system to investigate the mechanisms governing p21WAF1 mRNA decay. The regulation of mRNA decay is a critical mechanism in the control of gene expression (reviewed in Hollams et al. (18Hollams E.H. Giles K.M. Thomson A.M. Leedman P.J. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 957-980Google Scholar)) that involves interactions between cis-acting sequences that confer instability to mRNA and the trans-acting protein factors that bind them. Many cis-acting sequences consist of AU-rich elements (AREs), most often located in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of labile mRNAs. However, cis-acting elements are also found within the coding regions and 5′-UTRs of various mRNAs (e.g. c-fos, c-myc) (19Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Google Scholar). AREs often contain single or multiple repeats of pentamer (AUUUA) sequences, and inclusion of the AUUUA pentamer motif often targets the mRNA for rapid cytoplasmic degradation (20Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Google Scholar). One well characterizedcis-acting element is the AU-rich sequence found within the 3′-UTR of granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor mRNA, which is able to reduce the half-life of β-globin mRNA from many hours to less than 30 min (20Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Google Scholar). Other studies have shown the UUAUUUA(A/)U(A/U) nonamer sequence to be more predictive of rapid mRNA decay than the AUUUA pentamer motif (21Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Google Scholar, 22Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Google Scholar). Several other RNA binding motifs have been identified, including the C-rich motif that is the target for the poly(C)-binding proteins (CPs) (23Makeyev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 265-278Google Scholar). To date, the cis-activity of the 3′-UTR of p21WAF1has not been characterized extensively. Multiple proteins have been identified that can bind to AU- and U-rich regions (reviewed in Hollams et al. (18Hollams E.H. Giles K.M. Thomson A.M. Leedman P.J. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 957-980Google Scholar)). These include AUBF (24Gillis P. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3172-3177Google Scholar), AUF1 (hnRNP D) (25Brewer G. Mol. Cell.

Neumann M. Pavlakis G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2307-2311Google Scholar). Of the AU- and U-rich-binding proteins, only a few have been shown to definitively regulate mRNA stability: AUF1, HuR, and other Hu/ELAV proteins and tristetraprolin and its family members. HuR, a ubiquitously expressed member of the Hu/ELAV family, is involved in the shuttling of transcripts from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (33Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Google Scholar, 34Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Google Scholar, 35Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Google Scholar), as well as in the regulation of mRNA stability (17Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2130-2139Google Scholar). In RKO colorectal carcinoma cells, HuR mediates UVC-induced stabilization of p21WAF1 mRNA (17Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Google Scholar), and of interest, HuD, a neuron-specific member of the Hu/ELAV family (30Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Google Scholar), has been shown to bind to a 42-nt sequence within the 3′-UTR of p21WAF1 mRNA (39Joseph B. Orlian M. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20511-20516Google Scholar). It seemed possible, therefore, that HuR would play an important role in the regulation of p21WAF1 mRNA stability in breast cancer cells. Here, we show that the 3′-UTR of p21WAF1 mRNA contains multiple cis-acting regions that reduce basal reporter activity and confer EGF- and UVC-induced changes to reporter constructs in a region-specific manner. These 3′-UTR elements are the target for a number of RNA-binding proteins, including HuR and CP1, from MDA-468 breast cancer cells. Despite its role in the mediation of p21WAF1 mRNA stabilization and p21WAF1expression by UVC in other cell systems, HuR does not appear to have a major role in EGF-induced p21WAF1 expression in MDA-468 breast cancer cells (EGFR overexpressed, mutant p53). The MDA-468 (HTB 132) human breast cancer cell line was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). BING cells (40Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cell lines were cultured in the presence of penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Cells were utilized within 12 passages of the original stock received from ATCC for all experiments. For cell cycle analysis, EGF-treated (25 ng/ml, 4 nm) and control MDA-468 cells were harvested by trypsinization and then permeabilized and stained for DNA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 100 μg/ml RNase A. Flow cytometry was performed on a Coulter EPICS XL-MCL (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL), and cell cycle analysis was performed with MultiPlus AV MultiParameter data analysis software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). The p21WAF1 plasmid cDNA (pCEP-WAF1) (from Dr. B. Vogelstein) contained the 5′-UTR, coding region, and 3′-UTR of p21WAF1 (see Fig. 1 A; nucleotide sequence is in the GenBankTM data base under accession numberU03106) (1El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Google Scholar) and was digested with EcoRI and NotI to liberate a 1-kb cDNA fragment, which for Northern analysis, was random prime-labeled using [32P]dCTP (∼3000 Ci/mmol;Amersham Biosciences). A 1.1-kb 18 S rRNA cDNA probe was used as a loading control. Plasmids WAF1–1/7, WAF1–2/7, WAF1–6/7, WAF1–879, WAF1–1512, and WAF1–1/6 (Fig. 1 A) were constructed by cloning PCR-amplified sequences from the 3′-UTR of the p21WAF1 cDNA into either the XbaI site of pGL3-control luciferase reporter vector (Promega) for transfection experiments or into the BamHI/HindIII-digested pBluescript II KS+ vector (Stratagene) for the generation of labeled riboprobes. The plasmid containing the HuD binding site (WAF1-HuD) were constructed by subcloning annealed 42-mer sense (nt 657–698, 5′-UCU UAA UUA UUA UUU GTG UUU UAA UUU AAA CAC CUC CUC AUG-3′) (39Joseph B. Orlian M. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20511-20516Google Scholar) and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to this region of p21WAF1 3′-UTR (see Fig. 1, A and B) into the BamHI/HindIII sites of the pBluescript vector. The c-fos AU-rich element that generates an unstable mRNA was also cloned into the XbaI site of pGL3-control and used in transfection assays (22Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Google Scholar). pRL-SV40 (Promega) was utilized as a control for transfection efficiency in reporter assays. Some plasmids contained three AU-rich sequences (shown in Fig. 1,A and B) and are denoted A (nt 742–758, 5′-AAU UAU UUA AAC AAA AA-3′), B (nt 797–809, 5′-AUU UUU AUU UUA U-3′), and C (nt 811–824, 5′-AAA UAC UAU UUA AA-3′). For some RNA gel shifts (RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays) the plasmid c-fos-HuD (5′-AUA UUU AUA UUU UUA UUU UAU UUU UUU-3′) (29Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar) was also used (Fig. 1 B). All pBluescript plasmid clones were linearized with HindIII for transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in reactions containing [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), as described (41Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Walker C.E. Staton J.M. Leedman P.J. Biotechniques. 1999; 27: 1032-1042Google Scholar), to produce riboprobes with a specific activity of ∼2 × 109 cpm/μg RNA that included 66 nt of pBluescript, in addition to the corresponding portion of the p21WAF1 3′-UTR. Unlabeled RNA transcripts were synthesized as above except with 2.5 mm rNTPs, quantified by spectrophotometry and verified by PAGE. pGEX-2T-HuR (from Dr. H. Furneaux) generated a fusion protein (GST-HuR) that contained amino acids 2–326 of human HuR (29Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar). pGEX-6P-αCP1 (from Dr. M. Kiledjian) generated a fusion protein (GST-CP1) that contained amino acids 13–347 of human CP1 (60Kiledjian M. Day N. Trifillis P. Methods. 1999; 17: 84-91Google Scholar). For HuR over-/underexpression studies, the retroviral vector pBabe puro (42Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Google Scholar) was used. The sequence of all plasmid constructs was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. MDA-468 cells were solubilized in 4 m guanidinium isothiocyanate, and total RNA was isolated using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (43Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). RNA (10–15 μg per sample) was size-fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). RNA was UV cross-linked to the membrane, which was prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 0.75 m NaCl, 0.075 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and then hybridized in the same buffer overnight at 42 °C with32P-labeled p21WAF1 cDNA probe at 106 cpm/ml. The membrane was washed sequentially in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 20 min at 22 °C, 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 20 min at 22 °C, and finally in 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 5 min. Membranes were imaged with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In all experiments an 18 S rRNA cDNA probe was used for normalization. MDA-468 cells (70–80% confluent) were treated with EGF (25 ng/ml) (Promega) or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 2 h followed by the addition of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (ActD) at 7.5 μg/ml (Sigma). Total RNA was isolated from the cells at 0-, 2-, 4-, and 8-h time intervals after addition of ActD and subjected to Northern analysis as described earlier. p21WAF1 mRNA half-life was determined using linear regression analysis. MDA-468 cells (70–80% confluent) were treated with EGF (25 ng/ml) for 2 h. Nuclei were isolated as described previously (44Bjorge J.D. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4021-4027Google Scholar), rapidly frozen, and stored at −85 °C. The transcription assay was performed as described previously (45Yeap B.B. Krueger R.G. Leedman P.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3282-3291Google Scholar). Briefly, the nuclei were thawed on ice, resuspended in 100 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, and 100 μCi of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol;Amersham Biosciences)), and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Labeled RNA was isolated and hybridized to nitrocellulose filters onto which 5 μg of p21WAF1 and 18 S rRNA cDNAs had been blotted. Filters were washed and then analyzed by PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Control and EGF (25 ng/ml)-treated MDA-468 cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), containing freshly added protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). After 10 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 750 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was recovered and stored at −85 °C. Total protein concentrations of lysates were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and 10 μg of proteins were separated on 10% BisTris acrylamide gels (Invitrogen) in 1× MES SDS running buffer, pH 7.3 (Invitrogen), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Osmonics) in 1× NuPAGE transfer buffer, pH 7.2, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were blocked with 10% skim milk in TBS-T (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at 22 °C for 1 h, prior to addition of either anti-p21WAF1monoclonal antibody (1:1000) (15091A; BD Biosciences), anti-HuR monoclonal antibody 19F12 (1:2000) (from Henry Furneaux), or anti-actin monoclonal antibody (1:2000) (I-19, sc-1616; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), diluted in 10% skim milk/TBS-T, for 1 h at 22 °C. Membranes were then washed in 10% skim milk/TBS-T, incubated for 1 h in appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10000; Amersham Biosciences), and washed again with TBS-T, prior to detection with ECL Plus detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) on ECL-Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were quantified using an Eastman Kodak Co. digital DCS-420C camera and ImageQuant software. MDA-468 cells (50% confluent) were transiently transfected with 8 μg of pGL3-control, pGL3-WAF1–1/7, or pGL3-c-fos ARE using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were passaged, and 38 h after transfection they were treated with ActD (7.5 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 0–4 h. Total MDA-468 RNA was harvested using TRIzol (Invitrogen). To generate cDNA, 2 μl of RNA (denatured at 70 °C for 10 min) was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction containing 5 mmMgCl2, 1× avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase buffer, 1 mm dNTPs, 20 units of RNasin, 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and 250 ng of oligo(dT)15 primer at 42 °C for 30 min. PCR was then performed for both luciferase and β-actin cDNA (luciferase sense, 5′-TAC TGG GAC GAA GAC GAA CAC-3′; luciferase antisense, 5′-GTT CAC CGG CGT CAT CGT CG-3′; β-actin sense, 5′-GCC AAC ACA GTG CTG TCT GG-3′; β-actin antisense, 5′-TAC TCC TGC TTG CTG ATC CA-3′) using a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Data were normalized using results obtained for β-actin and the ratio of luciferase mRNA remaining for pGL3-WAF1–1/7 and pGL3-c-fos-ARE expressed relative to pGL3-control as a function of time after ActD treatment. MDA-468 cells (50% confluent) were transiently transfected with 8 μg of pGL3 ± various p21WAF1 3′-UTR regions (see Fig. 1 A) and 100 ng of pRL-SV40 as a control, using FuGENE 6 as above. Some cells were cultured following treatment with EGF (25 ng/ml) or UVC (254 nm, 20 J/m2), for 8 or 6 h respectively, prior to lysate extraction. Cells were washed in PBS, harvested by trypsinization, and lysed, and supernatant luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) and a Wallac Victor 1420 multilabel counter (Wallac Oy; Turku, Finland), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase (pGL3) activity was normalized against Renilla luciferase (pRL-SV40) activity to yield the relative luciferase activity. MDA-468 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 10-cm culture dishes. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (41Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Walker C.E. Staton J.M. Leedman P.J. Biotechniques. 1999; 27: 1032-1042Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped from the culture dishes in chilled PBS, centrifuged at 450 × g for 4 min at 4 °C, washed again with PBS, and then incubated for 20 min with cold cytoplasmic extract buffer (CEB; 10 mm HEPES, 3 μm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT), containing freshly added protease inhibitors (0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,100 × g, and the supernatant was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. MDA-468 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 10-cm culture dishes. Medium was removed, the cell monolayer was washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of chilled lysis buffer (containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm NaVO4, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm Na2MoO4·2H2O) on ice for 10 min. Cells were scraped and transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,100 × g and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Binding reactions were performed as described previously (41Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Walker C.E. Staton J.M. Leedman P.J. Biotechniques. 1999; 27: 1032-1042Google Scholar) with 5 μg of cytoplasmic extract or 200 ng of recombinant protein and 105 cpm of 32P-labeled RNA (∼2–5 pg). Briefly, binding reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 30 min, after which 0.3 units of RNase T1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added for 10 min, followed by the addition of heparin (final concentration 5 mg/ml) (Sigma) for 10 min. Complexes were separated by 4% PAGE, visualized by PhosphorImager, and analyzed by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In competition assays, extracts were incubated with an unlabeled competitor RNA (∼100-fold excess) for 30 min prior to addition of the 32P riboprobe. For supershift assays with the HuR antibody, the method used was as described previously (46Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Google Scholar). RNA-protein binding reactions were carried out as described above, using 20 μg of whole cell extract or 100–500 ng of recombinant protein, 1.5 × 105 cpm (10–15 pg) of32P riboprobe (41Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Walker C.E. Staton J.M. Leedman P.J. Biotechniques. 1999; 27: 1032-1042Google Scholar), and 2–5 μg of tRNA. Following the addition of heparin, samples were placed on ice in a microtiter tray and UV-irradiated 1 cm below the Stratalinker UV light source (240 nm UV-bulb; Stratagene) for 10 min. After UVXL, samples were incubated with RNase A (final concentration 100 μg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 15 min. The samples were boiled for 3 min in SDS sample buffer (50% glycerol, 0.25 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to SDS-PAGE (gels ranging from 8.5% to 12%), and RNA-protein complexes were detected by PhosphorImager. In some competition experiments, recombinant proteins were incubated with ribohomopolymers (poly(C), poly(A)) for 20 min, prior to addition of riboprobe. For UVXL immunoprecipitation assays, UVXL was performed as described above, and the reactions were then incubated for 1 h with HuR or GST antibody at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A and G beads (Sigma) for 45 min at 4 °C. After washing, RNA-protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE (gels ranging from 8.5 to 12%) and detected by PhosphorImager. In all UVXL experiments, 14C Rainbow molecular mass markers (AmershamBiosciences) were used. GST fusion proteins were prepared essentially as described (47Yeap B.B. Voon D.C. Vivian J.P. McCulloch R.K. Thomson A.M. Giles K.M. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furneaux H. Wilce M.C. Wilce J.A. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27183-27192Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-liter cultures of DH5α Escherichia coli expressing GST, GST-HuR, or GST-CP1 fusion constructs (described above) were induced atA 600 of 0.6 with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) at 30 °C for 2 h. GST fusion protein was purified from bacterial pellets, lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm glucose, 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.13% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, using glutathione beads (Sigma). GST protein was eluted in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 mm glutathione. To cleave HuR from the GST-HuR fusion protein, 0.1 units/μl of thrombin (AmershamBiosciences) was incubated with the GST-HuR on glutathione beads overnight at 4 °C, the sample was centrifuged at 12,100 ×g at 4 °C for 2 min, and the supernatant was collected. CP1 was cleaved from GST-CP1 with PreScission protease (AmershamBiosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins were quantified by B"

In cells, PrPc is modified post-translationally and transported along the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane, where it is attached to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. In surface biotinylation assays we observed that deletions within the unstructured N terminus of murine PrPc led to a significant reduction of internalization of PrP after transfection of murine neuroblastoma cells. Truncation of the entire N terminus most significantly inhibited internalization of PrPc. The same deletions caused a significant prolongation of cellular half-life of PrPc and a delay in the transport through the secretory pathway to the cell surface. There was no difference in the glycosylation kinetics, indicating that all PrP constructs equally passed endoplasmic reticulum-based cellular quality control. Addition of the N terminus of the Xenopus laevis PrP, which does not encode a copper-binding repeat element, to N-terminally truncated mouse PrP restored the wild type phenotype. These results provide deeper insight into the life cycle of the PrPc, raising the novel possibility of a targeting function of its N-proximal part by interacting with the secretory and the endocytic machinery.

These neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the accumulation of a conformationally altered isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPc),1 denoted PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

During biogenesis, PrPc is directed cotranslationally into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum by a 22-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide. This is then removed together with a 23-amino acid C-terminal signal sequence promoting attachment of a GPI anchor. The protein undergoes further post-translational modifications with the addition of twoN-linked carbohydrate chains. Properly folded PrPc transits through the Golgi compartment and the secretory pathway and is attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by its GPI anchor (4Borchelt D.R. Scott M.

Conversion of PrPc into PrPSc has been reported to occur close to the plasma membrane along the endocytic pathway, probably in caveolae-like domains or in rafts, membranous domains or invaginations of the plasma membrane rich in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (7Taraboulos A.

Here also the first steps in PrPcdegradation occur (8Kaneko K. Vey M. Scott M. Pilkuhn S. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell surface localization of PrPc is thought to be essential for subsequent conversion into PrPSc(4Borchelt D.R. Scott M. Taraboulos A. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5167) Google Scholar). The cellular function of the prion protein is still unknown, although binding of copper to the octapeptide repeat sequence located at its N terminus suggests a role of PrPc related to this phenomenon (10Hornshaw M.P.

Studies performed on the subcellular trafficking of GPI- anchored proteins have revealed that their sorting is not a simple default process because specific signals are required for transport from the Golgi to the cell surface and for endocytosis. These targeting signals are still poorly characterized. Although sorting and endocytosis of most transmembrane proteins require recognition of specific motifs in their cytoplasmic domains by multimeric adaptor protein complexes, other targeting elements are obviously necessary for the trafficking of GPI proteins which lack such cytoplasmic extensions. Several elements have been shown to influence PrPc trafficking. Studies done with PrP constructs lacking the GPI anchor revealed slower transport through the secretory pathway compared with wild type PrPc(wtPrPc) (14Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although conversion of these constructs into PrPSc was previously not found to be compromised significantly (15Rogers M. Yehiely F. Scott M. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Prevention of glycosylation affected the transport to the cell surface and changed the biochemical properties of PrPc (16Taraboulos A. Rogers M. Borchelt D.R. McKinley M.P. Scott M. Serban D.

In this report we were interested in devising a physiological function for the N-terminal part of PrPc in subcellular trafficking. We therefore performed various metabolic labeling and surface biotinylation assays to follow the intracellular trafficking and turnover of the PrP. We expressed specific N-terminal PrP deletion constructs and one chimeric Xenopus laevis-mouse construct in murine neuroblastoma cells and compared their internalization from the exofacial plasma membrane, their transport along the secretory pathway, and half-life with those of transfected wtPrPc. Our results showed significant differences in the behavior of these proteins, although all constructs effectively passed the cellular quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi. On the other hand, the chimeric protein consisting of the short N-terminal segment of Xenopus (amino acids 23–69) fused to the truncated mouse PrP nearly restored wild type secretory and endocytic kinetics. These data indicate that the N-proximal domain of the PrP functions as a putative targeting element and is essential for both transport to the plasma membrane and modulation of endocytosis. These targeting functions of the N terminus are also highly conserved in evolution. Monoclonal PrP-specific antibody 3F4 (Signet Pathology) recognizes the sequence encompassing amino acids 109 and 112 in hamster and human PrP and has been described before. Polyclonal anti-PrP-specific antibody A7 was obtained in our laboratories after immunization of rabbits with recombinant dimeric mouse PrP. Cell culture media and trypsin-EDTA were obtained from Invitrogen. [35S]Met/Cys (Promix; 1,000 Ci/mmol) for labeling of proteins, protein A-Sepharose, and an enhanced chemoluminescence blotting kit were from Amersham Biosciences. Endoglycosidase H (Endo-H), PNGase F, and Pefabloc proteinase inhibitor were all obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Biotin sulfo-NHS and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin were obtained from Pierce, and trypsin inhibitor was from Sigma. Transient and stable transfections were carried out using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or Effectene (Qiagen) transfection reagents. The mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2a (ATCC CCL 131) has been described (18Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The medium was changed every 48 h. wtPrPc and PrP chimeric constructs were all cloned into the pcDNA3.1/Zeo expression vector (Invitrogen). Substitution of amino acids 109 and 112 (numbering referring to human PrP according to Ref.19Wopfner F. Weidenhofer G. Schneider R. von Brunn A. Gilch S. Schwarz T.F. Werner T. Schatzl H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1163-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) in murine wtPrP with methionine using site-directed mutagenesis allows recognition of transfected mouse PrP by the monoclonal antibody 3F4 and discrimination from endogenous PrP because the antibody does not recognize murine wtPrPc. Construction of PrP chimeric constructs was done by PCR-based standard techniques using 3F4-tagged mouse PrP as a template. Insertion of appropriate restriction sites allowed cloning of PCR fragments into the multiple cloning site of the vector pcDNA3.1 using standard cloning techniques. Briefly, PrPΔ(23–90) was obtained by deleting amino acids 23–90 of full-length PrP (numbering referring to human PrP); in PrPΔ(48–93) residues 48–93 were deleted; in PrPΔ(23–51) and PrPΔ(68–91) amino acids 23–51 and 68–91 were absent, respectively. For cloning of PrPXen(23–69) a PCR fragment encompassing residues 23–69 of X. laevis was generated from an Image cDNA clone using primers allowing insertion of the fragment between amino acids 22 and 92 of murine PrP. Constructs were always confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing. Plasmid pEGFP (Clontech) was used as a control for specificity of results. All cloned constructs were transiently transfected into N2a cells by lipofection according to manufacturer's directions, and cells were lysed for experiments 72 h post-transfection. For selected constructs, stable transfections were performed in addition, using Zeocin as a selection marker. Confluent transfected cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate). Postnuclear cell lysates were supplemented with 0.5 mmPefabloc protease inhibitor and N-lauryl sarcosine to 1% and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge. Soluble fractions (supernatants) were precipitated with ethanol. Insoluble fractions (pellets) were resuspended in 50 μl of TNE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). Ethanol-precipitated samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 2,500 × g, and the pellets were redissolved in TNE buffer with the addition of gel loading buffer. Samples were then boiled for 10 min, and an aliquot was analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotranferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. This was blocked with non-fat dry milk (5%) in TBST (0.05% Tween 20, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8), incubated overnight with antibody 3F4 at 4 °C, and stained using an enhanced chemoluminescence blotting kit from Amersham Biosciences. Aliquots of postnuclear lysates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml PK; the digestion was stopped by the addition of Pefabloc. Samples were precipitated with ethanol and analyzed in an immunoblot assay. Confluent transfected N2a cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and starved for 1 h in RPMI medium without methionine/cysteine containing 1% fetal calf serum. Labeling was carried out by adding 400 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys to the medium for 5 min or, for half-life studies, for 1 h. After incubation, cells were washed twice in cold PBS and harvested with lysis buffer on ice for 10 min or incubated at 37 °C for different lengths of time in complete culture medium to allow transport to the cell surface. After appropriate chase times, cells were washed with PBS and either harvested directly or 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA was added on the dishes for 10 min on ice. Trypsinized cells were transferred to polypropylene tubes, and the reaction was stopped by centrifugation of the cells twice at 900 × g in PBS containing 20% fetal calf serum and 100 μl of trypsin inhibitor. Cells were then lysed in cold lysis buffer and cell debris removed by centrifugation for 40 s at 18,000 × g. After addition of 1%N-lauryl sarcosine postnuclear lysates were boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were placed on ice, and Pefabloc protease inhibitor was added; lysates were incubated with antibody A7 or 3F4, as indicated, overnight at 4 °C (dilution 1:300). Protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the protein-antibody complexes for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 1 min and washed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate in PBS) supplemented with 1% SDS at 4 °C. All samples were treated with 0.1 unit/μl PNGase F at 37 °C overnight to remove N-linked oligosaccharides and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were exposed to an x-ray film (Kodak), or the autoradiographic signals were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis of the gel (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of total or intracellular (after surface trypsin digestion) PrP present at each time point after the chase was expressed as a percentage of nascent PrP rescued from the cell lysate directly at the end of the labeling period. Endocytosis of wtPrPc and PrP mutants located on the cell surface was assessed by surface biotinylation. Briefly, confluent transfected N2a cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated on ice for 15 min with 1 ml of PBS containing 250 μg of biotin sulfo-NHS. Cells were washed again three times with cold PBS to remove unbound biotin and were either harvested directly with cold lysis buffer on ice for 10 min, or culture medium was added for appropriate chase times as indicated in the respective experiments at 37 °C to allow internalization. Cells were washed with PBS and either lysed directly or treated with 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA on ice for 10 min before lysis and immunoprecipitated as described above, using monoclonal antibody 3F4 for detection of transfected constructs. Immunoadsorbed proteins were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (AmershamBiosciences). Blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and visualized with enhanced chemoluminescence. Films were digitized using an APB Image Scanner and images quantified using Image Master 1D software (both from AmershamBiosciences). For Endo-H digestion, aliquots of protein lysates were incubated after immunoprecipitation with 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% SDS and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g, supernatants were supplemented with Endo-H buffer (0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.5% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 6 milliunits of Endo-H) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. All samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. PNGase F treatment was carried out by mixing 100 μl of postnuclear lysate or immunoprecipitated proteins with 20 μl of mercaptoethanol and 0.5% SDS and heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Supernatants from immunoprecipitation were incubated with lysis buffer, and all samples were supplemented with protease inhibitor and 0.1 unit/μl PNGase F overnight at 37 °C before analysis on SDS-PAGE. To assess the relevance of the N-terminal part of PrPc in its intracellular trafficking, we transiently transfected murine neuroblastoma cells with a series of PrP constructs in which amino acids within the N terminus had been progressively deleted (Fig. 1 A). All experiments were performed in parallel with and compared with transfected wtPrPc, to rule out possible effects on the kinetics caused by overexpression or metabolic stress upon transfection. The constructs were first characterized biochemically in a solubility assay. Postnuclear lysates were ultracentrifuged in a buffer containing 1% sarcosyl for separation of soluble from insoluble proteins. Aliquots of the lysates were subjected to a mild proteolytic treatment with PK or to PNGase F digestion. All samples were then run on a polyacrylamide gel and examined by Western blot analysis. The PrP deletion constructs were detected in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation and were therefore soluble (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2,5, 8, 11, and 14). They were also completely degraded by PK (lanes 3, 6,9, 12, and 15) and, upon PNGase F digestion, migrated as single unglycosylated bands (Fig. 1 C). Taken together these results indicate that deletions within the N-terminal parts do not alter the biochemical features of PrPc. We next focused on the endocytic arm of the PrPc life cycle and evaluated the kinetics of PrPc internalization. We labeled proteins expressed at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by adding membrane-impermeable biotin sulfo-NHS to the culture medium for 15 min on ice and either lysed the cells immediately or incubated them at 37 °C for different time periods to allow internalization. Subsequent digestion with trypsin on ice allowed separation of internalized proteins from those still present on the plasma membrane. Cells were then lysed and the wild type and mutant PrPs immunoprecipitated with the antibody 3F4, which allows discrimination of transfected constructs (all containing a 3F4 epitope) from endogenous PrP and to visualize endocytosis. We first compared the internalization of wtPrPc with that of mutant PrPs presenting deletions of different length in their N-terminal part: PrPΔ(23–51) lacked the 29 amino acids between the signal peptide and the octapeptide repeats, in PrPΔ(48–93) a segment of 44 residues encompassing the octapeptides was deleted, and in PrPΔ(23–90) the complete N terminus (67 residues after the signal peptide, therefore comprising octapeptide repeats and the region preceding them) were missing. Immediately after the label, all constructs were expressed on the cell surface because they could all be biotin-labeled (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1,8, 14, and 18) and could not be detected after treatment with trypsin, which only digests surface-located proteins (lanes 2, 9,15, and 19). Lane 7 shows lysate from cells transfected with the plasmid pEGFP, as a control, and precipitated with antibody 3F4, to show specificity of our results. Trypsinization of the wtPrPc and of PrPΔ(23–51) revealed that after 45 min of chase, only wtPrPc had been internalized efficiently (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and11). On the other hand, after 60 min both constructs had entered the cells although in different amounts: quantification of the blots revealed that ∼72% of wtPrPc had been endocytosed whereas PrPΔ(23–51) only measured ∼32% (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, neither PrPΔ(48–93) nor PrPΔ(23–90) could be detected intracellularly (lanes 17 and 21). To evaluate the kinetics of internalization for PrPΔ(48–93) and PrPΔ(23–90) in more detail, we prolonged the chase times using an analogous biotinylation assay (Fig. 3). This experiment revealed an extremely impaired endocytosis for both constructs: only small amounts of PrPΔ(48–93) were detectable inside the cell after 6 h of chase, rising to 65% after 10 h (lane 16). On the contrary, the level of intracellular PrPΔ(23–90) remained extremely low throughout the chase (lanes 4, 6, and 8) and only reached ∼7% of total amount of PrP after 10 h. Fig. 3 B shows a quantitative evaluation of two experiments. Because an altered endocytosis was observed in all PrP mutants analyzed, the stronger impairment clearly caused by the longer deletions, our results argue for a correlation between the length of the N-terminal truncation and the efficacy of PrP internalization.Figure 2Comparison of internalization of wtPrPc and deletion mutants after 45 and 60 min of chase.

In pulse-chase experiments we compared the half-lives of wtPrPc, PrPΔ(23–90), and PrPΔ(48–93). N2a cells expressing these constructs were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1 h and either harvested directly or chased for different intervals of time in 35S-free culture medium before lysis. PrP present in the lysates was immunopurified with the anti-PrP antibody A7, deglycosylated with PNGase F, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A). The use of the polyclonal antibody A7 in this and in the following experiments did not alter the results due to cross-reaction with endogenous PrPc because differences in molecular mass allowed discrimination between deletion mutants and endogenous wtPrPc. The autoradiogram was evaluated by densitometric analysis and the specific bands quantified as fractions of the signal observed in the absence of chase. Time points of 2, 3, 6, 8, and 22 h show that for all constructs the signal declined as a function of the chase. Curves in Fig. 4 B show the mean values from three independent experiments: wtPrPc revealed a half-life of ∼2.6 h. On the other hand, the turnover of our PrP mutants proved to be significantly prolonged. Our measurements indicated a half-life of ∼4.8 h for PrPΔ(23–90) and ∼4.2 for PrPΔ(48–93), both values almost twice as long as for wtPrPc. These data corroborate the idea that prolonged accumulation of N-terminal deleted mutants on the plasma membrane indeed affects the turnover of these proteins. Having found that the N-terminal part of PrPc plays an essential role in modulation of endocytosis and stability, we next focused on the secretory pathway and on the transport of PrP to the cell surface to identify a possible function of the N-proximal segment in this arm of the PrP life cycle. Using pulse-chase experiments we evaluated the time required by wtPrPc and PrP deletion constructs to reach the plasma membrane. After transfection, N2a cells were metabolically labeled with a short pulse of 5 min, to have a more homogeneous population, and then harvested immediately or incubated in [35S]Met-free medium at 37 °C for different time periods to allow transport to the cell surface. Molecules that had reached the plasma membrane were separated from those still undergoing synthesis or transport to the cell surface by trypsin treatment on ice for 10 min and were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-PrP antibody. All samples were deglycosylated with PNGase F for simplifying quantitative comparison of the constructs. Immediately after the pulse, wtPrPc and the PrP constructs were still protected from extracellular trypsin digestion (Fig. 5, lanes 2,8, and 14), consistent with their presence in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus. Our assay revealed that most of the wtPrPc molecules reach the cell surface within 1 h after synthesis (Fig. 5 A). In Fig. 5 Bthe mean data from three independent experiments show that although after 45 min 50% of total wtPrP can still be detected after trypsin treatment, the amount rapidly decreases to ∼25% after 60 min. The transport of PrPΔ(23–90) and PrPΔ(48–93) to the cell surface showed important differences compared with wtPrP. Even after 60 min of chase, both constructs were still detectable intracellularly in considerable amounts (Fig. 5 A); PrPΔ(48–93) was still clearly detectable after 75 min of chase. Quantification of the signals verified that 50% of labeled proteins were not susceptible to trypsin treatment after 65 and 75 min, respectively, for PrPΔ(23–90) and PrPΔ(48–93). This analysis corroborated the idea that deletion of N-terminal sequences negatively affects transport of PrPceven along the secretory pathway. For further analysis of the domains involved in trafficking of PrPc, we compared the transport of PrPΔ(23–51) with that of another construct where three of the five repeats (residues 68–91) had been removed, in a pulse-chase assay combined with trypsin treatment of transfected cells using the"
https://openalex.org/W1997266942,"The contribution of raft domains to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 entry was assessed. In particular, we asked whether the CD4 and CCR5 HIV-1 receptors need to associate with sphingolipid-enriched, detergent-resistant membrane domains (rafts) to allow viral entry into primary and T-cell lines. Based on Triton X-100 solubilization and confocal microscopy, CD4 was shown to distribute partially to rafts. In contrast, CCR5 did not associate with rafts and localized in nonraft plasma membrane domains. HIV-1-receptor partitioning remained unchanged upon viral adsorption, suggesting that viral entry probably takes place outside rafts. To directly investigate this possibility, we targeted CD4 to nonraft domains of the membrane by preventing CD4 palmitoylation and interaction with p56 lck . Directed mutagenesis of both targeting signals significantly prevented association of CD4 with rafts, but did not suppress the HIV-1 receptor function of CD4. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that the presence of HIV-1 receptors in rafts is not required for viral infection. We show, however, that depleting plasma membrane cholesterol inhibits HIV-1 entry. We therefore propose that cholesterol modulates the HIV-1 entry process independently of its ability to promote raft formation.

Sheets E.D. Simson R. Science. 1995; 268: 1441-1442Google Scholar). Domains composed of cholesterol and saturated lipids, e.g. sphingolipids, or rafts have recently been shown to support a wide range of cellular events, including signal transduction, sorting, and cellular trafficking of proteins and lipids, as well as pathogen entry into cells (2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Google Scholar). Nonionic detergent insolubility of these domains at 4 °C was found to result from tight packing of cholesterol and sphingolipids in a liquid-ordered state (3Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Google Scholar). This property allows recovery of rafts as low-density, floating membranes by gradient centrifugation and makes it possible to characterize raft lipids and proteins (4Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Google Scholar). Entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 into host cells relies primarily upon interaction of the viral glycoprotein envelope (Env) gp120 subunit with cell surface CD4 (5Dalgleish A.G. Beverley P.C. Clapham P.R. Crawford D.H. Greaves M.F. Weiss R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 763-767Google Scholar). Conformational changes of gp120 upon CD4 binding trigger interactions of the Env with HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 (6Moore J.P. Science. 1997; 276: 51-52Google Scholar). Subsequently, this binding to coreceptors exposes the Env gp41 transmembrane subunit and promotes fusion of viral and cellular membranes (7Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Google Scholar). It has been proposed that oligomeric assembly of Env proteins (8Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Google Scholar, 9Staropoli I. Chanel C. Girard M. Altmeyer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35137-35145Google Scholar) facilitates the recruitment of viral receptor (CD4 and coreceptors) molecules and ultimately HIV-1 entry (10Dimitrov D.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 697-702Google Scholar). Because a correlation between the cell surface density of HIV-1 receptors and efficiency of infection has been emphasized (10Dimitrov D.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 697-702Google Scholar), the clustering of CD4 and the coreceptor in delimited plasma membrane domains would be expected to favor HIV-1 entry. The CD4 antigen is among the few membrane-spanning proteins found to partition into raft domains enriched in sphingolipids (e.g.the GM1 ganglioside, a prototypic marker of these domains) (11Cinek T. Hilgert I. Horejsi V. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 110-116Google Scholar, 12Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Google Scholar, 13Millan J. Cerny J. Horejsi V.

The inhibition of HIV-1 infection was shown in both instances and believed to result from disruption of raft integrity. However, considering that inhibition of glycosphingolipids synthesis is not detrimental to raft domain formation (19Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

In the present work, a requirement for an association of CCR5 and CD4 with rafts to support HIV-1 entry was specifically addressed. A large body of evidence points to fatty acylation (specially, post-translational palmitoylation of cysteine residues) as a critical signal for targeting several inner leaflet signaling proteins to rafts (23Liang X. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Bornmann W. Tempst P. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30987-30994Google Scholar) and for a few raft-seeking transmembrane proteins (24Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Google Scholar, 25Arcaro A. Gregoire C. Boucheron N. Stotz S. Palmer E. Malissen B. Luescher I.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2068-2076Google Scholar, 26Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Google Scholar). It is conceivable that C-terminal palmitoylation of CD4 (27Crise B. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13593-13597Google Scholar) might account for localization of this protein to rafts. This prompted us to investigate whether interference with CD4 palmitoylation would alter the distribution of the CD4 receptor to rafts. Such a noninvasive approach led us to further investigate if CD4 maintains its HIV-1 receptor function when localized outside rafts. Here we show that palmitoylation of CD4 and its interaction with the tyrosine kinase p56 lck are important for the distribution of CD4 to rafts. In contrast to CD4, we present evidence that the CCR5 coreceptor preferentially partitions to nonraft domains, despite its palmitoylation on three C-terminal cysteine residues (28Blanpain C. Wittamer V. Vanderwinden J.M. Boom A. Renneboog B. Lee B., Le Poul E., El Asmar L. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31936-31944Google Scholar), both in T-cell lines and primary T-cells. Importantly, when predominantly redistributed to nonraft domains, CD4 still displays full receptor function for monocytotropic (R5)-HIV-1 strains. Together, our results indicate that CCR5-dependent HIV-1 infection does not depend upon the presence of CD4 and CCR5 receptors in rafts. Furthermore, we show that depleting plasma membrane cholesterol in target cells inhibits viral entry, suggesting that cholesterol-dependent membrane properties other than raft formation come into play to promote efficient HIV-1 infection. T-cell lines were grown in RPMI medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (growth medium). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T), baby hamster kidney cells (BHK), and human HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's growth medium with the same additives. A3.01, a CD4 hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine-sensitive variant of the CEM T-cell line (30Folks T. Benn S. Rabson A. Theodore T. Hoggan M.D. Martin M. Lightfoote M. Sell K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4539-4543Google Scholar) and its derivatives, CD4− (A2.01) and CCR5+ (A2.01R5, A3.01R5) cells, were obtained from H-T He (Centre d'Immunologie INSERM/CNRS de Marseille-Luminy, France). Stable ectopic CCR5 expression was maintained by culturing CCR5+T-cell lines in RPMI growth medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml geneticin (G418) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Both A3.01 and A2.01 T-cell lines have a defect in cholesterol biosynthesis and accumulate lanosterol, a cholesterol precursor, in FCS-depleted growth medium (31Buttke T.M. Folks T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8819-8826Google Scholar). However, we confirmed others' data (31Buttke T.M. Folks T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8819-8826Google Scholar) that in 10% FCS growth medium, the sterol contained in plasma membranes of these cells is mainly cholesterol, as assessed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (data not shown). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy donors using Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences AB) density gradient centrifugation. For lymphocyte experiments, freshly prepared peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 2–3 × 106 cells per ml were cultured in growth medium containing phytohemagglutinin (Sigma) at 1 mg/ml for 3 days and afterward growth medium was supplemented with recombinant interleukin 2 at 150 units/ml (Chiron) for 2 weeks. Cells were mostly CD14 negative and more than 70% CD4 positive, as assessed by FACscan analysis (results not shown). In cholesterol extraction experiments, 30 × 106 cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min with (cholesterol-depleted cells) or without (untreated cells) 5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD, Sigma) in 25 ml of RPMI medium supplemented with 1% FCS. Experiments were carried out at 37 °C under continuous, gentle stirring. Cells were washed twice with a Hepes-based saline buffer (Hepes 20 mm, NaCl 150 mm). To restore the cholesterol content of cholesterol-depleted cells, cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes were first prepared by adding small aliquots of a 180 mm propanol-2 solution of cholesterol to an aqueous solution of MBCD (1 g/10 ml). This was performed at 50–80 °C under continuous shaking up to a 1/10 MBCD to cholesterol final molar ratio. This cholesterol-MBCD stock solution was further diluted in RMPI medium supplemented with 1% FCS to yield a 2.6 mm MBCD solution, stirred for 40 min at 40 °C, then filtered through a Millipore filter (0.22 μm) prior to use. Loading of cholesterol was achieved following incubation of cholesterol-depleted cells for 30 min in a 25-ml final volume of the latter filtered solution. This procedure was performed at 37 °C under continuous gentle stirring. Cells were then rinsed twice (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl). The amount of cholesterol in treated cells was normalized to both their protein and phospholipid contents estimated in the whole cell extracts and in some cases in plasma membranes extracted according to Refs. 31Buttke T.M. Folks T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8819-8826Google Scholarand 32Maeda T. Balakrishnan K. Mehdi S.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 731: 115-120Google Scholar. Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The amount of phospholipid was estimated by a phosphate assay after total digestion in the presence of perchloric acid (34McClare C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 39: 527-530Google Scholar). Cholesterol was quantified using a colorimetric method based on the oxidation of the hydroxyl group at the carbon atom 3 in the β-position (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HIV-1 particles were produced and their concentration estimated by measuring both the HIV-1 Gagp24 antigen (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)) and the β-galactosidase activity in infected HeLa CD4LTRLacZ indicator cells, as previously described (29Percherancier Y. Planchenault T. Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31936-31944Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected either with the WT R5-HIV-1YU2 proviral DNA or the R5-HIV-1JR-CSF- luc , which carries the firefly luciferase (luc) reporter gene instead of nef (a gift from Dr. V. Planelles, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT), or were co-transfected with an HIV-1pNL4–3- luc envelope-deficient (env(−)), proviral DNA containing luc instead of nef and the R5-HIV-1-Ba-L Env-expressing vector. Luciferase activity was measured at the times indicated in the figure legends using a luminometer as described (29Percherancier Y. Planchenault T. Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31936-31944Google Scholar). Infection of T-cells with the indicated HIV-1 Gagp24 quantities is detailed in the figure legends. Genomic and HIV-1 reverse-transcribed DNAs were extracted 4 h post-infection after extensive cell washes, using a DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's indications (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HIV-1 primers and probe were designed to detect reverse-transcribed HIV-1 DNA by real-time quantitative PCR using the Taq-Man procedure. These were chosen according to Zack et al. (35Zack J.A. Arrigo S.J. Weitsman S.R., Go, A.S. Haislip A. Chen I.S. Cell. 1990; 61: 213-222Google Scholar) to detect either all HIV-1 reverse-transcribed DNA (R/U5 region of the long terminal repeat) or the full-length DNA (long terminal repeat/gag) and modified according to the Primer ExpressedTM program (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The forward primer was the same for the both sets: 5′-GCTAGCTAGGGAACCCACTGCT-3′. Reverse primers were 5′-CACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGAC-3′ and [5′-GTCCTGCGTCGAGAGATCTCCT-3′ mapping to the R/U5 and R/gag regions, respectively. The probe 5′-FAM-CCTCAATAAAGCTTGCCTTGAGTGCTTCA-TAMRA-3′ carried the 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) fluorescent dye and the 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) quencher at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Quantification of HIV-1 DNA was normalized according to the amount of genomic DNA by measuring the α-l-iduronidase cellular gene with 5′-ACTTGGACCTTCTCAGGGAGAAC-3′ and 5′-CACCTGCTTGTCCTCAAAGTCA-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively, and the probe 5′-FAM-CAGCGCCTCGGGCCACTTCA-TAMRA-3′ (a gift from Dr. J-M. Heard, Unité des Rétrovirus et Transfert Génétique, Institut Pasteur, Paris). Amplification was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 2 μl of DNA solution, 1 μm probe, 50 nm of each primer, and 25 μl of Taq-Man Universal PCR Mastermix Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Amplification and fluorescence detection were conducted in a 5700 Sequence Detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a program including first, 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C then 40 cycles, each one consisting of 15 s at 95 °C followed by 1 min at 60 °C. Intensity was related to the initial number of DNA copies. Standards, consisting of HIV-1YU2 and human α-l-iduronidase cDNA-containing plasmids (seven dilutions from 4 to 4 × 105 and 38 to 6 × 105 copies, respectively), and an HIV-1 minus template control (four dilutions of noninfected cells DNA, in ng: 100, 20, 2, and 0.2) were included in each assay, which were performed in duplicate. Copy numbers of α-l-iduronidase gene and HIV-1 genomes were determined for the four dilutions of DNA samples and by reporting the Ct (the minimum cycle number at which fluorescence was detected) for each assay on the respective standard curves. Mean quantities and standard deviation over the four dilutions of DNA samples were then determined. DRMs were obtained by sucrose floatation after Triton X-100 cell lysis according to Ref. 36Ilangumaran S. Briol A. Hoessli D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1328: 227-236Google Scholar. Briefly, 30 or 60 × 106 cells were washed twice in ice-cold TKM buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) containing a mixture of phosphatase (5 mm NAF, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmorthovanadate, 200 nm okadaic acid) and protease (Roche Molecular Biochemical) inhibitors. Cells were then incubated for 1 h on ice in TKM containing 1% Triton X-100 (v/v). Cell lysates were loaded on a sucrose step gradient (in w/v: 5–35 to 40%, 5- or 11-ml gradients for 30 or 60 × 106 cell, respectively) and were centrifuged to equilibrium for 20 h at 4 °C and 200,000 × g (Beckman L70 ultracentrifuge). Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and protein contents were estimated using the NanoOrangeTM quantification kit (Molecular Probes). Equal volumes of each gradient fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 4–12% NuPage (Invitrogen) in reducing (CD4, CCR5, p56 lck , and LAT) or nonreducing (CD46 and CD55) conditions. For immunodetection, the following antibodies were used: CD4 (1f6, Novocastra), CCR5 (MC5, a gift from Dr. M. Mack, Medical Policlinic, University of Munich, Germany), p56 lck (sc-13, Santa Cruz), LAT (Transduction Laboratories), CD46 (J4–48 Immunotech), and CD55 (sc-9156 Santa Cruz). Immobilized antigen-antibody complexes were detected with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-species IgG (Pierce), developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+, AmershamBiosciences), and quantified using a LAS-1000 CCD camera (Image Gauge 3.4 software, Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). GM1 ganglioside was detected by slot-blot using peroxidase-coupled choleratoxin (CTx) (Sigma). For immunoprecipitation, DRM fractions (pooled fractions 3–5) were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS (2% w/v) for 15 min at room temperature, then diluted with 450 μl of TKM containing 1% Triton X-100 before adding p56 lck or CD4 antibodies (OKT4, a gift from Dr. F. Lemonnier, Unité d'Immunité Cellulaire Antivirale, Institut Pasteur, Paris) and overnight incubation at 4 °C. Protein G/A-Sepharose-coupled beads (Calbiochem) were added for 2 h at 4 °C and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. [14C]Palmitate and [35S]Met metabolic labeling were performed as previously described (29Percherancier Y. Planchenault T. Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31936-31944Google Scholar). Radiolabeled cells were lysed in TKM buffer containing 1% Brij 96 (w/v) and CD4 was immunoprecipitated using OKT4 antibody. Where indicated, cells were incubated in the presence of 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) (100 μm) for 16 h throughout the labeling time. A3.01 cells (1 × 105) were treated to aggregate GM1 as described (26Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Google Scholar). Briefly, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled CTx (Interchim) was applied for 30 min at 4 °C, followed after washing by an anti-CTx monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C, then for 15 min at 37 °C. After three washes in 0.5% bovine serum albumin-containing RPMI (blocking buffer), cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mglycine in blocking buffer for 30 min and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human-CD4 (SK3, BD Pharmingen) or -CCR5 (2D7, BD Pharmingen) for 30 min. Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst) and fluorescence observed with a confocal laser microscope (Leica TCS4D instrument) using a PL APO ×63 oil immersion objective. CD4 cDNA carrying mutations in cysteines (Cys) interacting with p56 lck (Cys445-Ser/Cys447-Ser) (CD4 Lck−) was a gift from Dr. M. Marsh (MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College, London, UK). Mutagenesis by PCR of the WT- or -Lck− CD4 cDNAs was performed to substitute Cys residues at position 419 and 422 with Ala residues (Palm−and Palm−Lck−, respectively) using overlap extension with T7, Sp6, and two internal primers containing the mutation, as described previously (29Percherancier Y. Planchenault T. Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31936-31944Google Scholar). The forward and reverse primers were, respectively: 5′-GCTGTCAGGGCCCGGCACCGAAGGCGCCAAGCAGAG-3′ and 5′-GGCCCTGACAGCGAAGAAGATGCCTAGCCCAATGAAAAG-3′. The entire coding region of each construct (Palm−, Lck−, or Palm−Lck−) was confirmed by sequence analysis, before being cloned into the HIV-1-based lentiviral pTRIP vector (a gift from Dr. P. Charneau, Groupe de Virologie moléculaire et de Vectorologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris). The efficiency of the pTRIP vector relies on the presence of a triple-stranded DNA structure that acts as a cis-determinant of HIV-1 DNA import (37Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Google Scholar). Stable integration of the transgene into the host DNA permits efficient and long term transgene expression without clone selection. Virus stock production and infection were as described in Ref. 37Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Google Scholar to transduce and express CD4 variants (WT, Palm−, Lck−, or Palm−Lck−) in the A2.01 CD4− T-cell line. Briefly, virus particles were produced after transient co-transfection of HEK-293T cells using a standard calcium phosphate method, with the p8.91 encapsidation plasmid, the pHCMV-G vector encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope and the pTRIP vector encoding CD4 variants (WT, Palm−, Lck−, or Palm−Lck−). Viral titers were estimated as described above. The fluorescence-based assay of syncytia formation induced by HIV-1 Env (FLASH method) is described elsewhere (38Chanel C. Staropoli I. Baleux F. Amara A. Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisededos F. Altmeyer R. AIDS. 2002; 16: 3-6Google Scholar). Briefly, BHK cells were infected for 8 h using a Semliki forest virus-based strategy permitting surface expression of the R5-HIV-1-BX08 Env. Infected BHK cells were labeled with SNARFTM-1 and A2.01R5 target cells expressing various CD4 variants (WT, Palm−, Lck−, or Palm−Lck−) with CellTrackerTMGreen (CMFDA) for 30 min. Both cells were co-cultured in suspension at a 1:5 BHK to A2.01R5 cell ratio for 12 h at 37 °C. Fused cells were detected by FACscan analysis as doubly labeled syncitia, using CellQuest software. The dependence of this fusion assay upon the interaction between the HIV-1 Env and receptors was assessed using the following inhibitors, added at the start of the co-cultures: TAK779 (200 nm) (NIH AIDS reagent program) and AMD3100 (200 ng/ml) (AnorMed, Langley, Canada) that bind to CCR5 and CXCR4, respectively, and the CD4 monoclonal antibody, Q4120, that inhibits CD4-dependent fusion (5 μg/ml) (MRC AIDS reagent program). The effect of the modulation of plasma membrane cholesterol on HIV-1 entry was assessed using real-time quantitative PCR in a CD4 lymphoid T-cell line (A3.01) that stably expressed a functional CCR5 transgene (A3.01R5) and in interleukin-2-expanded primary T-cells that are mostly CD4+. Measurement of newly reverse-transcribed HIV-1 proviral DNA reflects the extent of viral fusion and internalization into target cells. Modifying the membrane cholesterol content was performed using MBCD (39Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Google Scholar), known to remove plasma membrane sterol more specifically (40Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Google Scholar). We found that incubating cells with 5 mm MBCD resulted in a decrease in cholesterol to protein ratios: 10.1 ± 2 μg of cholesterol/mg of protein to 4.1 ± 1.5 μg of cholesterol/mg of protein in A3.01R5 cells and 19.5 ± 3 μg of cholesterol/mg of protein to 7.4 ± 0.9 μg of cholesterol per/mg of protein in primary T-cells. Phospholipid to protein ratios were unaltered in cells treated with MBCD (124 ± 18 nmol of phospholipid/mg of proteins) as compared with untreated cells (116 ± 9). The same was observed in plasma membranes of MBCD-treated cells (1470 compared with 1365 nmol of phospholipid/mg of proteins in plasma membrane of untreated cells), thus demonstrating the specificity of this reagent for sterols. We controlled that the cholesterol deficit was maintained throughout the 4-h post-infection experiment and was not detrimental to cell viability or plasma membrane expression of HIV-1 receptors CD4 and CCR5 (data not shown). Plasma membrane cholesterol extraction resulted in a 50 and 60% decrease in newly reverse-transcribed HIV-1-proviral DNA in A3.01R5 and in primary T-cells, respectively, compared with untreated, infected control cells (Fig. 1,left and right panels, respectively). The results were the same using primers designed to detect either all HIV-1 reverse-transcribed DNA (R/U5 region of the LTR) (Fig. 1) or only the full-length reverse-transcribed HIV-1 proviral DNA (R/gag region) (data not shown). The minute amounts of HIV-1 DNA detected in untreated cells infected in the presence of a CD4 monoclonal antibody and the nucleotide analog azidothymidine (αCD4 + azidothymidine) indicate that this assay allows detection of newly synthesized viral DNA. We observed that re-loading cholesterol (cholesterol/protein ratios = 22.1 ± 5 and 40.3 μg/mg, respectively, in cholesterol-loaded A3.01R5 and primary T-cells) restored the capacity of cells to support HIV-1 entry. This is illustrated by the increase of proviral DNA to levels close to those detected in untreated infected cells (Fig. 1,MBCD-cholesterol). Such near complete reversion again validates MBCD as a specific and nondeleterious tool. Collectively, these results confirm recent observations regarding the importance of target cell plasma membrane cholesterol in regulating viral entry (16Mañes S. Del Real G. Lacalle R.A. Lucas P.

Virol. 2002; 76: 4709-4722Google Scholar) and extend them to primary CD4+ T-cells, the natural and major target of HIV-1. The question remains whether the observed regulatory effect of plasma membrane cholesterol relates to perturbation of raft domain integrity. The insolubility of some lipids and proteins in cold nonionic detergent Triton X-100 correlates well with their partitioning into ordered phases of biological membranes (3Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A.

https://openalex.org/W1964797450,"Illite-smectite interstratified clay minerals are ubiquitous in sedimentary basins and they have been linked to the maturation, migration and trapping of hydrocarbons, rock cementation, evolution of porewater chemistry during diagenesis and the development of pore pressure. But, despite the importance of these clays, their structures are controversial. Two competing models exist, each with profoundly different consequences for the understanding of diagenetic processes: model A views such interstratified clays as a stacking of layers identical to endmember illite and smectite layers, implying discrete and independently formed units (fundamental particles), whereas model B views the clays as composed of crystallites with a unique structure that maintains coherency over much greater distances, in line with local charge balance about interlayers. Here we use first-principles density-functional theory to explore the energetics and structures of these two models for an illite-smectite interstratified clay mineral with a ratio of 1:1 and a Reichweite parameter of 1. We find that the total energy of model B is 2.3 kJ atom(-1) mol(-1) lower than that of model A, and that this energy difference can be traced to structural distortions in model A due to local charge imbalance. The greater stability of model B requires re-evaluation of the evolution of the smectite-to-illite sequence of clay minerals, including the nature of coexisting species, stability relations, growth mechanisms and the model of fundamental particles."

Enforced MTA1 expression in HT1080 cells reduced basal and 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced 92-kDa type IV collagenase (MMP-9) protein/mRNA levels. DNase I hypersensitivity andPstI accessibility assays revealed multiple regions of the MMP-9 promoter (−650/−450 and −120/+1), showing reduced hypersensitivity in the MTA1-expressing cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated MTA1 binding to the distal region, which spans several regulatory cis elements. Co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay experiments revealed histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2)-MTA1 protein-protein interactions and the MTA1-dependent recruitment of HDAC2 to the distal MMP-9 promoter region, yielding diminished histone H3/H4 acetylation. However, HDAC2 binding and H3/H4 acetylation at the proximal MMP-9 region were unaffected by MTA1 expression. Furthermore, trichostatin treatment only partially relieved MTA1-repressed MMP-9 expression, indicating a HDAC-insensitive component possibly involv ing the nucleosome-remodeling Mi2 activity, which was recruited to the promoter by MTA1. In summary, (a) MMP-9 adds to a short list of MTA1-regulated genes, which so far only includes c-myc and pS2, and (b) MTA1 binds to the MMP-9 promoter, thereby repressing expression of this type IV collagenase via histone-dependent and independent mechanisms.

Thus, Bernhard et al. (9Bernhard E.J. Gruber S.B. Muschel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4293-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) reported that the overexpression of this metalloproteinase in rat embryo cells conferred a metastatic phenotype, whereas the inhibition of MMP-9 expression by a ribozyme blocked metastasis of rat sarcoma cells (10Hua J. Muschel R.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5279-5284PubMed Google Scholar). The MMP-9 gene located on chromosome 20 (11) covers 13 exons spanning 7.7 kilobases, (12Collier I.E. Bruns G.A.P. Goldberg G.I. Gerhard D.S. Genomics. 1991; 9: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and its transcription yields a 2.5-kilobase mRNA (13Huhtala P. Tuuttila A. Chow L. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16485-16490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of MMP-9 protein levels has been ascribed to transcriptional activation of the gene (14Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J.

The 5′-flanking sequence contains binding sites for AP-1, NFκB, Sp1, and Ets transcription factors within the first 670 base pairs, and these have been implicated in the regulation of MMP-9gene expression by a variety of cytokines and contact inhibition (14Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar,18Sato H. Kita M. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23460-23468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Himelstein B.P. Lee E.J.

In addition, studies with transgenic mice have demonstrated the requirement of regions −522/+19 and −2722/−7745 for developmental regulation in mice and for tissue-specific expression in osteoclasts and migrating keratinocytes, respectively (20Mohan R.

Although MMP-9 has been implicated in both physiological and pathological processes, how its expression is regulated is still not fully understood. In the last 5 years, a great deal of interest has accrued in a group of genes collectively referred to as metastases-associated genes, which modulate cancer metastases but not tumorigenesis (22Lee J.-H. Welch D.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2384-2387PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gao A.C. Lou W. Dong J.T. Isacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 846-849PubMed Google Scholar, 24White A. Lamb P.W. Barrett C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One of these is the MTA1 gene, which is overexpressed in metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma and prostate cancers (25Toh Y. Pencil S.D. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22958-22963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26La Tulippe E. Santagopan J. Smith A. Scher H. Scardino P. Reuter V. Gerald W.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4499-4506PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently determined to enhance the migration and invasion of immortalized human keratinocytes (27Mahoney M.G. Simpson A. Jost M. Noe M. Kari C. Pepe D. Choi Y.W. Uitto J. Rodeck U. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2161-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The MTA1 gene resides on chromosome 14q32.3 (28Cui Q. Takiguchi S. Matsusue K. Toh Y. Yoshida M.A. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 93: 139-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and encodes a protein, which binds histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and HDAC2)1 (29Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the MTA1 protein is one of the subunits of the human nucleosome-remodeling and deacetylation complex shown previously to regulate in vitro transcription of at least artificial reporter constructs via ATP-dependent nucleosome disruption and changes in histone acetylation (30Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Because MMP-9 has a well established role in tumor cell invasion and metastases and considering that MTA1 expression is associated with the metastatic phenotype, we undertook the present study to determine whether the expression of this collagenase is targeted by this metastases-associated gene. A plasmid construct expressing a myc-tagged human MTA1 (pBJ-myc/MTA1) and its vector pBJ-Myc were as described previously (31Toh Y. Kuninaka S. Endo K. Oshiro T. Ikeda Y. Nakashima H. Baba H. Kohnoe S. Okamura T. Nicolson G.L. J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 19: 105-111PubMed Google Scholar). To construct the MTA1-expressing vector in the Flp-In System (Invitrogen), the pBJ-myc/MTA1 was digested with XbaI andBamHI. A 2.2-kilobase fragment corresponding to the MTA1 cDNA was purified and ligated into the pcDNA5/FRT vector. The resulting MTA1-expressing plasmid was designated as pcDNA5/FRT/MTA1. Antibodies to acetylated histones 3 and 4 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), whereas the rabbit antibody directed against HDAC2 (H54) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to HDAC1 (H11), HDAC2 (C-8), and a rabbit antibody to Mi2 (H-242) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human fibrosarcoma cells HT1080 were routinely maintained in McCoy 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For transfections, cells were transfected with poly-l-ornithine as described previously (15Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Nead M.A. McCance D.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 668-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Clones were selected with the appropriate antibiotic: 600 μg/ml G418, 300 μg/ml zeocin, or 300 μg/ml hygromycin B. This was performed as described in the two-step protocol provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). First, a Flp-In host cell line containing a single copy integrated FRT sequence was established from HT1080 cells. For this purpose, HT1080 cells were transfected with pFRT/lacZeo and selected in zeocin-containing medium. The resistant clones were expanded and analyzed by Southern blotting (33Wang H. Skibber J. Juarez J. Boyd D. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To identify single integrants of the FRT sequence, DNA from the clones digested with HindIII was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and, after transfer to a nylon membrane, was hybridized with a 290-base pair 32P-labeled LacZ cDNA fragment derived by digesting pFRT/lacZeo with EcoRV andClaI. DNA containing a single integrated pFRT/lacZeo copy is identified by a single hybridizing band. A clone designated as F8 was thus obtained, expanded, and transfected with 1.8 μg of the Flp-In recombinase-encoding pOG44 and 0.2 μg of pcDNA5/FRT/MTA1 or pcDNA5/FRT. Transfected cells were selected, pooled, and cultured in hygromycin B-containing media. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1× proteinase inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and 60 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% milk, and incubated with a Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) or a goat anti-MTA1 antibody (A-18) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing, the membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by ECL. Preparation of total RNA and reverse transcription were as described previously (15Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). cDNA was then subjected to multiplex PCR with 5 nm MMP-9 primers (5′-GAGGTTCGACGTGAAGGCGCAGATG-3′ and 5′-CATAGGTCACGTAGCCCACTTGGTC-3′) and 0.5 nm β-actin primers (5′-ACACTGTGCCCATCTACGAGG-3′ and 5′-AGGGGCCGGACTCGTCATACT-3′). To ensure that amplification was in the linear range, PCR was terminated at cycles 18, 20, and 22, respectively. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane, and the membrane was hybridized with a 32P-labeled MMP-9 cDNA. Linearity of the PCR amplification was confirmed with serial dilutions of MMP-9 cDNA. Quantitation of MMP-2 mRNA was accomplished by Northern blotting as described previously (34Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10804-10812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) using stringency washes performed with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Condition medium was collected, and aliquots normalized for varying cell numbers were subjected to zymography as described by us previously (34Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10804-10812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in IPH buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× proteinase inhibitor) on ice for 30 min. After clarification by centrifugation, cell lysate (3 mg of protein) was incubated with 40 μl of an anti-c-Myc-agarose conjugate (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Agarose beads were then washed three times in 1 ml of IPH buffer and boiled in 25 μl of loading buffer, and eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with the indicated antibody, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL. This method was performed with an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were mixed with 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 1 μm of each primer and loaded into the ABI Detection System. After incubating at 95 °C for 10 min to activate the AmpliTaq Gold enzyme, the mixtures were subjected to 40 amplification cycles (15 s at 95 °C for denaturation and 1 min for annealing and extension at 60 °C). After PCR, dissociation curves were generated with one peak, indicating the specificity of the amplification. A threshold cycle (Ct value) was obtained from each amplification curve using the software provided by the manufacturer. ChIp assays were performed essentially as described previously but with modifications (15Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107) were treated with 1% formaldehyde and lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mmEDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). The chromatin samples were sonicated to reduce DNA length to 200–500 base pairs and precleared with protein A-agarose beads. Antibodies (2 μg) were added to the chromatin samples and incubated at 4 °C overnight. To minimize nonspecific binding, single-stranded DNA/protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 30 min. 40 μl of treated beads was then added to the chromatin samples and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed five times as described previously. Immunoprecipitates were then eluted, cross-links were reversed, and after proteinase K treatment, DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and co-precipitation with glycogen. DNA was dissolved in 20 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm, pH 8.0). For immunoprecipitating MTA1-bound chromatin, the same protocol was employed with the exception that anti-c-Myc-agarose conjugate (A7470, Sigma) was used after pretreatment with 1% SDS and 1 mg/ml single-stranded DNA at room temperature for 30 min. Two different approaches were used to analyze the MMP-9 promoter fragments in the immunoprecipitated samples. For conventional PCR, a pair of primers (P1) spanning −634/−484 (5′-ATTCAGCCTGCGGAAGACAG-3′ and 5′-ACTCCAGGCTCTGTCCTCTT-3′) was used with the following PCR cycle parameters: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s; annealings at 56 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The number of PCR cycles are indicated in the figure legends. Alternatively, real-time PCR was done as described above to quantify the immunoprecipitated DNA. Two primer sets were used for amplifying the −657/−484 and −86/+34 regions, respectively: PN1, 5′-TGTCCCCTTTACTGCCCTGA-3′ and 5′-ACTCCAGGCTCTGTCCTCTT-3′; and P3, 5′-TGACCCCTGAGTCAGCACTT-3′ and 5′-CTGCCAGAGGCTCATGGTGA-3′. A ΔCt value was calculated by subtracting the Ct value for the 2% input sample from the Ct value for the immunoprecipated (IP) sample,i.e. ΔCt = Ctinput − CtIP. The percentage of the total input amount for the IP sample then was calculated by raising 2 to the ΔCt power,i.e. % total of IP sample = 2ΔCt × 2 as described previously (35Frank S. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme accessibility assays were performed essentially as described elsewhere (36Weinmann A.S. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Immunity. 1999; 11: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 37Rao S. Procko E. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4494-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). 5 × 10 6 cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0,15 mm spermine, and 0.5 mm spermidine) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Nonidet P-40 was then added (final concentration = 0.5%), and the cells were vortexed and incubated on ice for another 5 min. Nuclei were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with RE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 mm spermine, and 0.5 mm spermidine), and then resuspended in 90 μl of buffer H (Roche Applied Science). Restriction digestions were performed with 100 units of PstI for 15 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated with 2× proteinase K buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS). Reaction mixtures were then supplemented with 50 μl of 2× proteinase K buffer, 50 μl of RE buffer, 80 μg of proteinase K, and 50 μg of RNase A and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Genomic DNA was harvested by phenol/chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation and then dissolved in TE buffer. To determine the amount of uncut DNA, 150 ng of genomic DNA was used for real-time PCR with primer set P3. The amount of uncut DNA was determined by plotting the Ct value of the samples in a standard Ct curve made by co-amplifying varying amounts of undigested genomic DNA (60–180 ng) (37Rao S. Procko E. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4494-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Nuclei were purified from 3 × 107 cells as described above, washed, and resuspended in 500 μl of DNase I digestion buffer (15 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 320 mmsucrose, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, and 0.15 mm spermine) containing varying amounts of DNase I (Worthington Biochemicals, Lakewood, NJ). Digestions were carried out on ice for 30 min following the addition of 2.5 μl of 1 mMgCl2. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 0.5 mm EDTA solution followed by sequential incubations with 100 μg of RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h and with 400 μg of proteinase K, 0.6% SDS at 37 °C overnight. DNA was purified by with phenol, phenol/chloroform, and ether; precipitated with ethanol; and dissolved in TE buffer. DNA (30 μg) was digested with 150 units of ApaLI, and fragments were resolved by gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane. DNA was indirectly labeled by hybridizing with a32P-labeled probe (PCR derived with the 5′-CAGTCCACCCTTGTGCTCTT-3′ and 5′-CTTCAGATACGCCCATCACC-3′ primer set using the genomic clone RP11.465L10) spanning +92/+284 of theMMP-9 gene. To answer the question as to whether MTA1 expression regulates metalloproteinase expression, we first generated HT1080 cells expressing the MTA1 coding sequence. To eliminate the confounding issue of clonal variation due to a heterogeneous cell population and random integration of the expression construct, we used the Flp-In system (Invitrogen). First, a host clone was generated by stably transfecting HT1080 cells with an expression construct (pFRT/lacZeo) bearing a zeocin-resistant coding sequence and the Flp-In system recombination target site (FRT). Zeocin-resistant clones were subjected to Southern blotting (Fig. 1 A) to select a clone bearing a single copy of the integrated plasmid. Clone F8 was determined to bear a single copy by virtue of the single band generated when the genomic DNA was digested with HindIII and probed with the lacZ cDNA sequence. In contrast, clone F9 contained multiple FRT copies as indicated by the several bands hybridizing with the probe. Subsequently, clone F8 was co-transfected with a Flp recombinase-encoding plasmid (pOG44) and the pcDNA5/FRT expression vector bearing nothing or the full-length MTA1 coding sequence (pcDNA5/FRT/MTA1). The Flp recombinase catalyzes a homologous recombination event between the FRT sites in clone F8 and the pcDNA5/FRT-expressing vector (empty or bearing the MTA1 coding sequence). Because the pcDNA5/FRT expression vector encodes a hygromycin B-resistant coding sequence, resulting transfectants were selected in hygromycin B and pooled. Western blotting demonstrated MTA1 protein in the cells (designated MTA1) transfected with the pcDNA5/FRT/MTA1 plasmid when compared with the cells bearing the empty vector (designated FRT) or the F8 host clone (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether MTA1 expression altered metalloproteinase expression, conditioned medium was analyzed by zymography. An enzymatic activity indistinguishable in size (92 kDa) from MMP-9 was detected in the control (FRT) cells. The intensity of this band was greatly induced by PMA (Fig. 2 A), a known stimulant of MMP-9 expression (38Davis G.E. Martin B.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1113-1120PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the MTA1-expressing cells showed diminished basal MMP-9 activity and demonstrated an attenuated response to the phorbol ester. Equally important, a gelatinolytic activity migrating at the 72-kDa position, which is encoded by a separate type IV collagenase (MMP-2) (11Linn R. DuPont B.R. Knight C.B. Plaetke R. Leach R.J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 72: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Collier I.E. Bruns G.A.P. Goldberg G.I. Gerhard D.S. Genomics. 1991; 9: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Huhtala P. Chow L. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11077-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was unaffected by MTA1 expression arguing against a generalized repressive effect of this metastases-associated gene. To corroborate these data, total RNA was extracted from cells treated under identical conditions and analyzed for steady-state MMP-9 transcript (Fig. 2 B). Again, when compared with the FRT cells, the MTA1-expressing cells contained a lower basal level of MMP-9 mRNA and was induced to a lesser extent by the phorbol ester. In contrast, both basal and PMA-induced MMP-2 mRNA levels were unaffected by MTA1 expression (Fig. 2 C). Thus, attenuated MMP-9 activity is due to a less abundant MMP-9 mRNA in the MTA1-expressing cells. The ability of MTA1 to repress MMP-9 expression might be direct or indirect via the modulated expression of other genes. If the effect of MTA1 is direct, we predict that MTA1 would be bound to the endogenous MMP-9promoter. As a first step in this direction, we identified the regions of the in vivo MMP-9 promoter targeted by MTA1. Nuclei from the MTA1 or FRT cells were incubated with varying amounts of DNase I, DNA purified and digested to completion withApaLI. Three hypersensitive regions were identified (Fig. 3, parentheses) with one located approximately at −650/−450 and the other two closely spaced regions located at −120/+1 relative to the transcriptional start site. Both distal (−650/−450) and proximal (−120/+1) regions were of particular interest because they contain several transcription factor binding sites (distal region AP-1, PEA3, Sp1, and NFκB; proximal region AP-1) reported previously by our group and others (14Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar,18Sato H. Kita M. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23460-23468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Gum R. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Chen J.-H. Sato H. Seiki M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10672-10682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) to regulate MMP-9 expression. Importantly, the intensity of these hypersensitive regions was diminished in the MTA1-expressing clone indicating a more compact chromatin structure in these cells. Densitometric analysis (Quantity One software, Hercules, CA) indicated a 35–60% reduction in the intensity of the hypersensitive regions in the MTA1-expressing clone. To corroborate these results, we subjected the more proximal region of the MMP-9 promoter to endonuclease accessibility assays. Nuclei from the FRT and MTA1 cells were isolated and incubated with PstI. DNA was then extracted and subjected to real-time PCR using primers (Fig. 4 A), which span thePstI site in the proximal DNase I hypersensitive region. In this method, PCR amplification can only occur with the uncut DNA because the primers span the PstI restriction site. This assay revealed a dramatic reduction in the percent ofPstI-cut DNA (Fig. 4 B) in the MTA1-expressing cells, further indicating a more compact chromatin structure of the proximal MMP-9 promoter region in vivo. We then determined whether the distal DNase I hypersensitive region, which contains multiple regulatory cis elements, was bound with MTA1. Because the cloning strategy to generate the cells bearing the MTA1 sequence integrated at the FRT site had removed the myctag, we stably transfected parental HT1080 cells with amyc-tagged MTA1 sequence. After selection of a clone (M10) with G418, MTA1 protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-myc antibody (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, MTA1 protein was undetectable in clone P derived from HT1080 cells transfected with the empty vector. Subsequently DNA proteins were cross-linked in themyc-tagged MTA1-expressing clone M10 and the control clone P. Chromatin was prepared and sheared by sonication, and protein-bound DNA was immunoprecipitated with the anti-myc tag antibody. Precipitated DNA spanning the −634/−484 MMP-9 promoter region was amplified by PCR. The anti-myc antibody efficiently precipitated (Fig. 5 C) the endogenousMMP-9 promoter fragment from the MTA1-expressing clone M10, whereas no detectable signal was apparent with control clone P. Furthermore, the MMP-9 promoter sequence was not detected when the anti-myc antibody was deleted from the reaction. These data indicate that MTA1 is bound to the MMP-9 promoterin vivo. Since MTA1 has previously been shown to bind HDAC1 and HDAC2, we considered the possibility that the more compactMMP-9 promoter regions as shown above was due to the recruitment of these deacetylases. To address this possibility, M10 and P cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-mycantibody, and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to Western blotting for the HDACs. HDAC2 was co-immunoprecipitated from lysates of the MTA1 clone (Fig. 6), whereas this deacetylase was undetectable with control clone P. In contrast, HDAC1 protein was undetectable in these co-immunoprecipitation assays using either clone (data not shown). These data reveal MTA1-HDAC2 protein-protein interactions"

https://openalex.org/W2074871030,"It has been suggested that protein-protein interaction is important for protein kinase C (PKC) α to activate phospholipase D1 (PLD1). To determine the one or more sites on PKCα that are involved in binding to PLD1, fragments containing the regulatory domain, catalytic domain, and C1–C3 domain of PKCα were constructed and shown to be functional, but they all failed to bind and activate PLD1 in vivo and in vitro. A C-terminal 23-amino acid (aa) deletion mutant of PKCα was also found to be inactive. To define the binding/activation site(s) in the C terminus of PKCα, 1- to 11-aa deletion mutants were made in this terminus. Deletion of up to 9 aa did not alter the ability of PKCα to bind and activate PLDl, whereas a 10-aa deletion was inactive. The residue at position 10 was Phe663. Mutations of this residue (F663D and F663A) caused loss of binding, activation, and phosphorylation of PLD1, indicating that Phe663 is essential for these activities. Time course experiments showed that the activation of PLD1 by PMA was much faster than its phosphorylation, and its activity decreased as phosphorylation increased with time. Staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, completely inhibited PLD1 phosphorylation in response to 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate PMA and blocked the later decrease in PLD activity. The same results were found with the D481E mutant of PKCα, which is unable to phosphorylate PLD1. These results indicate that neither the regulatory nor catalytic domains of PKCα alone can bind to or activate PLD1 and that a residue in the C terminus of PKCα (Phe663) is required for these effects. The initial activation of PLD1 by PMA is highly correlated with the binding of PKCα. Although PKCα can phosphorylate PLD1, this is a relatively slow process and is associated with inactivation of the enzyme. It has been suggested that protein-protein interaction is important for protein kinase C (PKC) α to activate phospholipase D1 (PLD1). To determine the one or more sites on PKCα that are involved in binding to PLD1, fragments containing the regulatory domain, catalytic domain, and C1–C3 domain of PKCα were constructed and shown to be functional, but they all failed to bind and activate PLD1 in vivo and in vitro. A C-terminal 23-amino acid (aa) deletion mutant of PKCα was also found to be inactive. To define the binding/activation site(s) in the C terminus of PKCα, 1- to 11-aa deletion mutants were made in this terminus. Deletion of up to 9 aa did not alter the ability of PKCα to bind and activate PLDl, whereas a 10-aa deletion was inactive. The residue at position 10 was Phe663. Mutations of this residue (F663D and F663A) caused loss of binding, activation, and phosphorylation of PLD1, indicating that Phe663 is essential for these activities. Time course experiments showed that the activation of PLD1 by PMA was much faster than its phosphorylation, and its activity decreased as phosphorylation increased with time. Staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, completely inhibited PLD1 phosphorylation in response to 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate PMA and blocked the later decrease in PLD activity. The same results were found with the D481E mutant of PKCα, which is unable to phosphorylate PLD1. These results indicate that neither the regulatory nor catalytic domains of PKCα alone can bind to or activate PLD1 and that a residue in the C terminus of PKCα (Phe663) is required for these effects. The initial activation of PLD1 by PMA is highly correlated with the binding of PKCα. Although PKCα can phosphorylate PLD1, this is a relatively slow process and is associated with inactivation of the enzyme. phospholipase D phosphatidic acid diacylglycerol protein kinase C phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate phosphatidylcholine Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphatidylbutanol regulatory domain catalytic domain amino acid(s) wild type Phospholipase D (PLD)1is a ubiquitous enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). PA can be metabolized to diacylglycerol (DAG) by PA phosphohydrolase. PA and DAG are involved in receptor-mediated intracellular signal transduction, secretion, cytoskeletal reorganization, and the respiratory burst (2Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date two isoforms of mammalian PLD (PLD1 and PLD2) have been cloned. These isoforms share about 50% amino acid similarity, but exhibit quite different regulatory properties (2Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLD1 has a low basal activity and responds to protein kinase C (PKC) and to members of the Rho and Arf families of small G proteins (3Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K.

Most reports indicate it is localized in the perinuclear region, including the Golgi apparatus, and some have reported its presence in caveolae (10Freyberg Z. Sweeney D. Siddhanta A. Bourgoin S.

PKCα belongs to the group of conventional PKC isoforms that are regulated by Ca2+, DAG, and phosphatidylserine. It has a regulatory domain, which includes the pseudosubstrate, the C1 (phorbol, DAG binding) and C2 (calcium, phosphatidylserine binding) domains, a catalytic domain, which includes the C3 (ATP binding) domain, and C4 kinase domain. PKCα is mainly located in the cytosol and can translocate to membrane fraction upon stimulation by phorbol esters or certain agonists (13Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). PKCα is considered to play a major role in PLD1 activation (2Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the one or more mechanisms involved in PLD1 activation are still not clear. Some studies have shown that PKCα activates PLD1 through a phosphorylation-independent mechanism, because PKCα could activate this PLD isoform in vitro without ATP (4Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K., Gu, G. Copok S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, treatment of phosphorylated PLD1 with Ser/Thr phosphatase did not affect its activity (17Xie Z., Ho, W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24962-24969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Instead of phosphorylation, protein-protein interaction has been considered the main mechanism for PKCα to activate PLD1. Association between PLD1 and PKCα has been observed in COS-7 cells (18Lee T.G. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Hong S. Kim J.H. Him Y., Yi, K.S. Bae S. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Commun. 1998; 248: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Utilizing proteolytic cleavage of PKCα to separate the regulatory and catalytic domains, it was suggested that the regulatory domain of PKCα was more important for PLD1 activation in vitro (16Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, other groups have provided evidence that phosphorylation of PLD1 is needed for its activation. It was found that PMA-dependent PLD1 activation required ATP in cell-free systems from neutrophils and HL60 granulocytes (20Lopez I. Burns D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19465-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, a possible role for ATP in PIP2 synthesis was not excluded. PLD1 was also found to be phosphorylated by PKCα at multiple sites during activation, and the phosphorylation occurred in caveolin-enriched microdomains within the plasma membrane (21Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D., Oh, Y.S. Chung C. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park S.K. Yoo J.-S. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10344-10351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Kim Y. Han J.M.

Mutation of three of the sites resulted in a partial reduction in the ability of PMA to activate the enzyme in vivo (21Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D., Oh, Y.S. Chung C. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park S.K. Yoo J.-S. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10344-10351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the requirements for PKCα activation of PLD1. Different fragments of PKCα, including the regulatory and catalytic domains and one that encompassed the C1–C3 domains, were constructed to see which domain or domains were required for binding and activation of PLD1. In addition, several C-terminal deletion mutants of PKCα were constructed to define the role of the C terminus. These studies indicted that both the regulatory and catalytic domains are required and identified Phe663 as a crucial residue in the binding and activation of PLD1. Studies of the binding of PKCα with PLD1 were performed and indicated a high correlation between binding and activation of the phospholipase. The role of phosphorylation was explored by determining the time courses of PLD1 activation and phosphorylation and the effects of a PKC inhibitor and a PKCα mutant deficient in kinase activity. The results indicated that phosphorylation was not required for activation of PLD1 but was associated with inactivation. 4β-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), staurosporine, bovine serum albumin, Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were from Sigma. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut) standard were from Avanti Polar Lipids Corp. [methyl-3H]PC and [3H]myristic acid were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein G-agarose beads, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), penicillin, streptomycin, fetal bovine serum, Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels, PcDNA3.1(+), PcDNA3.1(HisA,B,C) vectors, and anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody were from Invitrogen. The transfection reagent FuGENE6 and the protease inhibitor mixture were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. COS-7 cells were from American Type Culture Collection. Anti-PKCα monoclonal antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-PKCα (C-terminal) monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-phosphothreonine polyclonal antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.Plasmid and PCR-product purification kits were from Qiagen. QuikChange mutagenesis kit and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase were purchased from Stratagene. Anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase, ECL reagent, and film were from Amersham Biosciences. All restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England BioLabs. The rat PKCα in PTB vector and the regulatory domain (1–311) in PCH3 vector were kindly provided by Dr. Susan Jaken (Eli Lilly). The rat PLD1 was cloned into PcDNA3.1(His) vector with the N-terminal Xpress tag. The rat PKCα and its regulatory domain were subcloned at the EcoRI site into PcDNA3.1(+) vector. Catalytic domain (312–672), C1–C3 (1–468), Δ23 (1–649), Δ11 (1–661), Δ10 (1–662), Δ9 (1–663), Δ8 (1–664), Δ7 (1–665), Δ6 (1–666), Δ5 (1–667), and Δ1 (1–671) were generated by PCR with primers containing the 5′ and 3′ EcoRI sites. D481E, F663D, and F663A mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. All constructs were sequenced to verify the coding regions and were well expressed in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in 10% CO2. Six-well plates were seeded with 2 × 105 cells/well, and 10-cm dishes were seeded with 8 × 105 cells 24 h before transfection with FuGENE6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 5 h of transfection, cells in six-well plates were serum-starved overnight (0.5% fetal bovine serum in DMEM) in the presence of 1 μCi/ml [3H]myristic acid. PLD activity was assayed by incubating the cells with 0.3% 1-butanol for 20 min and measuring the formation of [3H]PtdBut as a percentage of total labeled lipids as described before (23Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After transfection and starvation overnight, 10-cm dishes of COS-7 cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested using lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). After 10-s sonication for two times, the cell lysate was first centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant was then spun at 120,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C to separate the cytosolic and crude membrane fractions. For in vitro assay, the cells were either untransfected or separately transfected with PLD1 or PKCα or its mutants. The control supernatant or that containing overexpressed PKCα or its mutants was used as the PKC fraction, and the crude membranes containing PLD1 were resuspended in lysis buffer and used as the PLD1 fraction. The PLD1 activity was measured by the formation of [3H]PtdBut in vitro as described previously (14Min D.S. Park S.-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7044-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipid vesicles generated from phosphatidylethanolamine/PIP2/PC (16:1.4:1, v/v) containing [palmitoyl-3H]PC (0.5 μCi/reaction) were used with 1-butanol (0.6%) as substrate. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped with chloroform/methanol/HCl (50:98:2, v/v). The lipids were extracted from the organic phase and resolved by thin-layer chromatography. Bands co-migrating with a PtdBut standard were quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. COS-7 cells cultured in 10-cm plates were transfected and starved overnight as described above. The cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested using immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer containing 25 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 1.2 mmNa3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors mixture. The cell suspensions were sonicated for 10 s and then spun at 120,000 × g for 45 min to pellet the detergent-insoluble fraction. The supernatant was then precleared by mixing it with 1 μg of affinity purified mouse IgG and 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein G beads for 1h at 4 °C. The mixture was then spun and the supernatant was incubated with 2 μl of anti X-press antibody and 20 μl of protein G beads overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with the immunoprecipitation buffer and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The blots were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with primary antibody and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The bands were detected using ECL. To see if some PKCα domains might be enough to activate PLD1, the regulatory domain (RD, 1–311, 37 kDa) catalytic domain (CATA, 312–672, 43 kDa), C1–C3 domain (1–468, 55 kDa), and a C-terminal 23-aa deletion mutant (Δ23, 1–649, 76 kDa) were constructed, and their expression, binding, and activation of PLD1 are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 A shows that none of the PKCα domains activated the endogenous PLD activity of COS-7 cells in the absence or presence of PMA. Co-expression of the regulatory and catalytic domains also did not restore the stimulation of PLD activity (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with overexpressed PLD1 in COS-7 cells (data not shown). Western blotting (Fig. 1 B) shows that all the domains were well expressed and of the appropriate molecular mass. Some additional immunoreactive proteins were present in all samples, corresponding to endogenous PKCα and an unknown protein of 46 kDa. The catalytic domain was also well expressed (Fig. 1 B). To demonstrate that the domains were functionally intact, PMA-induced membrane translocation of the wild type enzyme, regulatory domain, and C1–C3 fragment was tested. Fig. 1 C shows that all these proteins were translocated. As expected, the catalytic domain did not (data not shown). To test the functional intactness of the catalytic domain, the ability of this fragment and wild type PKCα to increase the Thr phosphorylation of proteins in COS-7 cell lysates was examined. Fig. 1 D illustrates that both PKCα and its catalytic domain induced marked phosphorylation of several proteins. In vitro PLD1 assay results (Fig. 1 E) were consistent with the in vivo PLD results, i.e.none of the PKCα domains activated PLD1. Fig. 1 (F andG) shows the results of binding tests between PLD1 and PKCα or its domains. Before PMA stimulation, there was slight binding between PLD1 and PKCα, which was greatly increased by PMA. However, none of the domains was able to bind to PLD1 in the presence or absence of PMA. As shown in Fig. 1 B, all the domains were well expressed, as was PLD1 (not shown). Fig. 1 demonstrated that a C-terminal 23-aa deletion of PKCα resulted in a loss of its ability to bind and activate PLD1. To further define the residue(s) involved, C-terminal deletion mutants of 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 aa were made and shown to be well expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). Fig. 2 A shows the effects of the different PKC mutants on endogenous PLD activity in vivo. It is evident that, with deletion of 9 C-terminal residues (Δ9), PKCα still retained its ability to activate PLD. However, a 10-aa deletion (Δ10) caused PKCα to lose this. Similar results were found with overexpressed PLD1 in COS-7 cells (data not shown). To confirm these results, the Δ9 and Δ10 mutants were examined in an in vitro PLD1 assay. The results were consistent with thein vivo data in that Δ9 mutant retained the ability to activate PLD1, whereas Δ10 mutant lost it (Fig. 2 B). Adding higher concentrations of PKCα and the Δ9 mutant increased the PLD activity whereas higher concentrations of the Δ10 mutant did not, further supporting the conclusion that the Δ10 mutant is inactive on PLD1 (data not shown). Fig. 2 C shows the binding between PLD1 and PKCα or its C-terminal 9- and 10-aa deletion mutants. The Δ9 mutant showed binding with PLD1 in the presence of PMA stimulation that was equivalent to that of the intact enzyme, whereas the Δ10 mutant showed negligible binding. Importantly, both the Δ9 and Δ10 mutants still retained kinase activity as shown by the phosphorylation of proteins in the cell lysates (Fig. 1 D). The above results indicate that Phe663, which is 10 aa from the C terminus, is very important for PKCα to activate PLD1. To prove this, two single-amino acid mutants (F663D and F663A) were made to test their effects on PLD1. Both mutants were expressed very well in COS-7 cells and translocated from the cytosol to membrane fraction after PMA stimulation (data not shown). In vivo PLD assays showed that both mutants could not activate endogenous PLD activity in COS-7 cells in the presence or absence of PMA (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained when overexpressed PLD1 in vivo (data not shown). In vitro PLD assay results also showed that both mutants lost the ability to activate PLD1 (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained with higher concentrations of the PKCα mutants were employed (data not shown). Fig. 3 C shows the binding between PLD1 and the two mutants. The results show that both mutants bound negligibly to PLD1 even in the presence of PMA stimulation. The phosphorylation of PLD1 by PKCα was also studied using antibodies to phospho-Ser, phospho-Thr, and phospho-Tyr, and the results showed that only Thr residues were detectably phosphorylated after PMA stimulation (data not shown). Fig. 3 D shows the results of PLD1 phosphorylation by PKCα and its mutants. The data show that PKCα greatly increased PLD1 phosphorylation upon PMA stimulation. The Δ9 mutant could still phosphorylate PLD1 upon PMA stimulation, whereas the Δ10 mutant completely lost this function. The two Phe663 mutants also showed greatly decreased ability to phosphorylate PLD1. Expression of higher levels of the PKCα mutants still showed greatly impaired PLD1 phosphorylation (data not shown). As expected from the findings with the deletion mutants, both the F663D and F663A mutants retained general phosphorylating ability (Fig. 1 D). These results indicate that PLD1 is phosphorylated by PKCα upon PMA stimulation and indicate that binding is required for this phosphorylation. The above results indicated that binding was required for PKCα to activate PLD1, because all the deletions and mutations that caused PKCα to lose its ability to bind to PLD1 also caused a loss of activation. However, because phosphorylation of PLD1 by PKCα must involve some association between the two enzymes, it was ambiguous whether or not PLD1 phosphorylation was required for its activation. To further study the role of phosphorylation in PLD1 activation, the time courses of PLD1 activation and phosphorylation upon PMA stimulation were studied. This required a modification of the usual protocol,i.e. COS-7 cells were first treated with PMA for 1, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, then 1-butanol was added, and the cells were incubated for another 2 min. The results are shown in Fig. 4. It is evident that PLD1 activity rose very rapidly after PMA stimulation, reaching a maximum in about 3–5 min. Thereafter the activity decreased to near basal (0.1% PtdBut) in 30 min. Fig. 4 B shows that PKCα rapidly translocated from the cytosol to membrane fraction within 1 min upon PMA stimulation and its membrane association increased over 30–60 min. Fig. 4 Cshows the time course of PKCα binding with PLD1 after PMA treatment. The binding was also detectable at 1 min and increased during the 1-h experiment. Fig. 4 D shows that the PLD1 phosphorylation was not evident until 5 min but then continuously increased during the 1-h incubation. The time course results indicated that the activation of PLD1 by PMA was much faster than its phosphorylation. This suggested that PLD1 activation was independent of its phosphorylation and raised the possibility that phosphorylation actually decreased the activity of the phospholipase. To see if phosphorylation of PLD1 does decrease its activity, two kinds of approaches were used: a PKC kinase inhibitor staurosporine and a kinase-deficient PKCα mutant (D481E) (24Hofmann J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 Ashows that staurosporine strongly inhibited PLD1 phosphorylation induced by PKCα in the presence of PMA. The D481E mutant also showed barely detectable phosphorylation of PLD1 upon PMA stimulation (Fig. 5 B), consistent with its lack of kinase activity. The time course experiments (Fig. 5 C) showed that the inhibitor partially blocked the peak activation of PLD1 induced by PMA (0–10 min) and diminished the later decline in activity (10–30 min). Similar results were seen in cells expressing endogenous PKC (data not shown). Compared with wild type PKCα, in cells expressing the D481E mutant, PMA induced a smaller initial activation of PLD and a slower later decline in PLD activity (Fig. 5 C). In an effort to explain the differences in peak PLD activity, the effects of staurosporine and the D481E mutation on the binding of PKCα to PLD1 were tested. Staurosporine caused a minimal effect on the binding between PKCα and PLD1 in the absence of PMA but partially reduced the association in the presence of the phorbol ester (Fig. 5 D). Binding to PLD1 was also less with the D481E mutant compared with wild type PKCα (Fig. 5 E). Binding between PKCα and PLD1 was first observed in COS-7 cells (17Xie Z., Ho, W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24962-24969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and later in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (18Lee T.G. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Hong S. Kim J.H. Him Y., Yi, K.S. Bae S. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1347: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not examine the relationship between the binding and the activation of PLD1. In the present study, we provide much evidence that the activation of PLD1 by PMA is highly correlated with the binding of PKCα. This was demonstrated by the effects of deletions and mutations in PKCα on the two parameters (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) and was supported by the observation that the initial time course of activation of PLD1 was correlated with its association with PKCα and not with its phosphorylation. A major binding site for PKCα on PLD1 is located at the N terminus (25Park S.-K. Min D.S. Exton J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Sung T.-C. Zhang Y. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol.

In this study, we initially focused on the binding sites for PLD1 in PKCα. A previous report using proteolysis and chromatography to separate the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKCα indicated that the regulatory domain might be the critical region for PLD1 activationin vitro (16Singer W.D.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2640-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the regulatory domain was also shown to activate PLD1 in vitro, but it was less potent and considerably less effective than intact PKCα. so we first studied the binding between PLD1 and this domain and showed no detectable binding. More PKCα fragments were made, including the catalytic domain and the C1–C3 fragment, but these fragments also failed to bind and activate PLD1. The fragments were shown to be functionally intact by either their membrane translocation in response to PMA or their retention of kinase activity. Thus these data indicated that PKCα with both the regulatory and catalytic domains intact was required for association and activation of PLD1. Because PLD is membrane-associated, it is likely that the interaction between PKCα and PLD1 occurs at a membrane locus. Thus the C1 and C2 domains of the regulatory domain, which are required for membrane targeting and translocation of PKCα (29Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F.G. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 30Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) would seem to be essential for activation of PLD1. By this reasoning, the catalytic domain, which stays in the cytosol irrespective of PMA stimulation (data not shown), should be unable to activate PLD1. The observation that the Δ23 mutant, which possesses the domains for membrane targeting, was unable to activate PLD1, indicates that PKCα also requires one or more residues in the C terminus to bind and activate PLD1. Previous reports showed that, with deletion of up to 11 aa in the C terminus, PKCα retained kinase activity (32Su L. Paraissenti A.M. Riedel H. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar), so we made more C-terminal truncation mutants to study their effects on PLD1 activity. The results showed that the Δ9 mutant still bound to and activated PLD1, whereas the Δ10 mutant did not, and that both mutants retained kinase activity. In support of the conclusion that the C-terminal 10-aa position (Phe663) is important for PKCα to activate PLD1, two mutants of this residue (F663D and F663A) also failed to bind and activate PLD1. In agreement with a previous study (32Su L. Paraissenti A.M. Riedel H. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar), the F663D, F663A, and Δ10 mutants retained kinase activity (Fig. 1 D). Thus the inability of these mutants to phosphorylate PLD1 (Fig. 3 D) reflects their inability to bind to the phospholipase (Figs. 2 C and 3 C). The issue of whether or not phosphorylation is needed for PLD1 activation remains controversial. Several studies have shown that ATP is not needed for PKCα to activate PLD in vitro (4Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K., Gu, G. Copok S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

Also, Ser/Thr phosphatase treatment dephosphorylates PLD1in vitro but does not inhibit its activity (17Xie Z., Ho, W.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24962-24969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, there is also a report showing that PLD1 is phosphorylated during activation by PKCα (22Kim Y. Han J.M. Han B.R. Lee K.-A. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Jang L.-H. Suh P.-G Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13621-13627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Trypsin treatment of the phosphorylated enzyme immunoprecipitated from cells treated with PMA, followed by two-dimensional peptide mapping, revealed multiple P-peptides (22Kim Y. Han J.M. Han B.R. Lee K.-A. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Jang L.-H. Suh P.-G Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13621-13627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Some of these overlapped with P-peptides generated from the phosphorylation of PLD1 by PKCα in vitro. These P-peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry to reveal phosphorylation of PLD1 at residues Ser2, Thr147, and Ser561(22Kim Y. Han J.M. Han B.R. Lee K.-A. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Jang L.-H. Suh P.-G Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13621-13627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mutation of these to Ala resulted in a partial loss of PMA-stimulated PLD activity in vivo. However, many other P-peptides were not analyzed, raising the question of what phosphorylation of these other residues would do to PLD1 activity. In addition, the effects of the mutations on the activation of PLD1 by PKCα in vitro were not tested. Our results showed that PLD1 becomes Thr-phosphorylated during PMA treatment of cells expressing wild type PKCα but not the Δ10, F663D, and F663A mutants (Fig. 3 D). However, to answer the key question of whether or not this phosphorylation is required for PLD1 activation, we carried out time course experiments to measure the real-time PLD1 activity after PMA treatment (Fig. 4 A) (32Su L. Paraissenti A.M. Riedel H. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Once PtdBut is formed in the PLD assay, it is only slowly degraded, so that the standard assay, in which 1-butanol is added first and then PMA is added for different time lengths, only reflects the accumulation of PtdBut, not the real-time PLD1 activity. The real-time results indicated that the increase in PLD1 activity was much faster than the phosphorylation increase (Fig. 4, compare A withD). After the initial peak of PLD1 activation, there was a slower decrease in activity, consistent with the frequently observed phenomenon that PtdBut accumulation ceases after several minutes of treatment with PMA or some agonists when PLD activity is measured using the conventional assay (see Ref. 33Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, and references therein). Thus, the initial activity increase was not associated with detectable phosphorylation, whereas the subsequent activity decrease was correlated with increased phosphorylation (Fig. 4,A and D). In other words, the results were consistent with PLD1 phosphorylation having an inhibitory effect on activity. PLD1 activity quickly reached its peak at 1 min, and membrane translocation and association of PKCα with PLD1 could be detected at that time (Fig. 4, A–C). It therefore appears that the initial association of PKCα with PLD1 is sufficient for PLD1 to reach its full activation. To further explore the relationship between PLD1 activation and phosphorylation, a PKC kinase inhibitor staurosporine and a kinase-deficient PKCα mutant (D481E) were used. As expected, staurosporine strongly inhibited PLD1 phosphorylation upon PMA stimulation (Fig. 5 A). The D481E mutant also caused negligible phosphorylation of the enzyme (Fig. 5 B) consistent with its lack of kinase activity. When the effects of these agents on the PLD1 activity time course in response to PMA were compared with wild type PKCα alone, both the inhibitor and the D481E mutation induced a lower peak of PLD1 activity, but then slowed the subsequent decline in activity (Fig. 5 C). The latter results support the conclusion that phosphorylation of PLD1 inhibits its activity. However, the effects of both staurosporine and D481E on the PLD1 peak activity were not consistent with our proposed effect of phosphorylation. To study this, we explored the effects of these agents on the association between PLD1 and PKCα. Fig. 5 D shows that staurosporine partly decreased the association in the presence of PMA, and Fig. 5 E shows that the D481E mutant bound PLD1 to a less extent than wild type PKCα. These changes in the association with PLD1 could explain the reduced initial activation of PLD. The reasons are unclear why staurosporine and the D481E mutation partly reduce the association of PKCα with PLD1 and, hence, decrease the initial activation of PLD1. This is because the domains in PKCα that are involved in the binding/activation of PLD1 are unknown. Presumably the D481E mutation partially disrupts this interaction, as does the binding of staurosporine to the catalytic (ATP binding) domain. In summary, our results indicate that both the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKCα are required for activation of PLD1 and that there is a required residue (Phe663) in the C terminus. Surprisingly, our data indicate that phosphorylation is not required for the stimulatory action of PKCα on the enzyme in vivoand suggest that phosphorylation is involved in the down-regulation of PLD activation that is commonly seen at later times in cells treated with PMA and agonists.

Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that regulation of these events occurs through the active exchange of associated factors with the RNAP II1 complex (2Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 3Otero G. Fellows J., Li, Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol.

Cell. 1999; 3: 697-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based upon identification of numerous positive and negative regulatory factors/complexes, influencing both transcription and RNA processing enzymes, in physical association with RNAP II. Many of these complexes exert their effects directly or indirectly through association with the RNAP II CTD. In mammals, the RNAP II CTD is composed of 52 heptapeptide repeats with the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser (YSPTSPS), which are essential for viability (5Dahmus M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The RNAP II CTD is heavily phosphorylated in vivo, and it is likely that sequential phosphorylation events, as well as phosphorylation of specific residues by specific protein kinases, help regulate transcript production. This model appears to fit much of the data coming from numerous laboratories and was recently proposed as the most likely means of coordinating the various steps of transcription, RNA processing, and mRNA export (6Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Many protein kinases modify the RNAP II CTD. Several of the CTD kinases identified thus far are from the cyclin-dependent kinase family (CDKs) and include CDK1, CDK7, CDK8, and CDK9. In addition, another regulator of cell cycle events, casein kinase 2 (CK2), is known to phosphorylate a number of transcriptional proteins, including the RNAP II CTD and the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF (7Egyhazi R.

Experiments are described here demonstrating that the CDK11p110 protein kinases are members of RNAP II-containing complexes that include CK2. Furthermore, CDK11p110immunoprecipitation complexes (IP complexes) contain an RNAP II CTD-directed kinase activity. However, we show that CK2, and not CDK11p110, is the kinase responsible for this RNAP II CTD phosphorylation. In addition, we demonstrate that CDK11p110association with, and amino-terminal phosphorylation by, CK2 in vivo requires the RD/RE protein interaction domain of CDK11p110. Thus, the data herein suggest the existence of CDK11p110 protein complexes in which signaling to the RNA transcriptional and processing machinery may be influenced by CK2 kinase activity.

GST fusion proteins were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 3 h. The cells were first pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in cold PBS, and then sonicated on ice. Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the lysate was spun at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads overnight, rotating at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in 100 bed volumes of cold PBS, and the remaining bound proteins were eluted in 4 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris (pH 8) containing 20 mm glutathione. The eluted proteins were dialyzed into 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 50 μm ZnSO4, and 10% glycerol.

Transfected cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Incubations with antibodies for the purpose of immunoprecipitation of protein complexes were performed in lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Washes were performed three times using 1 ml of lysis buffer. Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (9Loyer P. Trembley J.H. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the CTD kinase assays, immunoprecipitations performed as described above were resuspended in 10 μl of kinase buffer (without ATP). Substrate (1 μg) was added in a total volume of 10 μl of water, followed by 10 μl of 2× kinase buffer containing cold and [γ-32P]ATP, making the final volume 30 μl. The kinase reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The final protein kinase reaction buffer contained 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml acetylated BSA, 10 μm ATP, 3–5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm benzamidine, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 0.1 mm NaF. For the heparin- and DRB-containing protein kinase reactions, the drugs were incubated with the beads for 5 min at room temperature prior to the addition of substrate and ATP-containing kinase buffer. Heparin was obtained from Sigma (H-4784; stock solution made in water at 50 mg/ml) and American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. (100 USP units/ml). The effective concentration range (with no effect on TFIIH) for the Sigma heparin was 2–10 μg/ml, and the range for the American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. heparin was 0.33–2.5 units/ml (0.01–0.075 units/30-μl reaction volume). The protein kinase reaction supernatants were boiled in sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE analysis. The gels were washed extensively in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid; dried; and exposed to x-ray film. Using a Bio-Rad BioLogic HR chromatography system, a cellulose phosphate P11 (Whatman) cation exchange column (5 ml) was loaded with 15 mg of HeLa nuclear extract protein (3 mg/ml, prepared as described in Ref. 17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) and washed with 15 ml of P11 buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.1 mKCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.0m KCl P11 buffer, followed by a 10-ml wash of 1.0m P11 buffer. 1-ml fractions were then collected. The entire purification procedure, from P11 through the CDK11p110 antibody affinity purification columns, was performed as previously described (12Trembley J.H., Hu, D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2589-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The only exception was that the 0.8 m KCl P11 fractions and the 0.5 m KCl DEAE fractions were used here. The protein samples were digested with endoproteinase Lys-C and trypsin according to the method of Link et al. (18Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar). The resulting peptide mixture was analyzed by combined capillary liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry was performed using ThermoFinnigan LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometry with an electrospray ion source. Fragment ion (MS2) spectra were subjected to search using the SEQUEST program of Eng and Yates (ThermoFinnigan). We recently published data demonstrating that CDK11p110 affinity-purified complexes contain RNAP II (12Trembley J.H., Hu, D. Hsu L.C. Yeung C.Y. Slaughter C. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2589-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observed that interference with CDK11p110 activity negatively affected transcript production in vitro. Given that CDK11p110 is found in RNAP II complexes, it was reasonable to determine whether the RNAP II CTD was a substrate for this kinase. Protein kinase assays, from immunoprecipitations using several affinity-purified CDK11p110 antibodies in parallel with known CTD kinases such as CDK7 and CDK1, suggested that the RNAP II CTD was a good substrate for CDK11p110 (data not shown). Characterization of this kinase activity revealed that the imperfect consensus repeats (repeats 32–52) were a much better substrate for this kinase activity than the perfect repeats (Fig. 1 A). To verify that this CTD kinase activity was due to CDK11p110 and not to a co-immunoprecipitating kinase, three different kinase-inactive, FLAG-tagged CDK11p110 mutants were transiently transfected into HeLa cells in parallel with a FLAG-tagged version of the wild-type CDK11p110 kinase. The point mutations for the kinase inactive forms of CDK11p110 included K439N, D534N, and D552N. These mutations were selected based upon previous studies of serine/threonine kinase structure and function, which demonstrated the requirement of specific conserved amino acids for enzymatic activity (19De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 20Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J.

Once the mutant forms of CDK11p110 were transfected into HeLa cells and given time to express their corresponding proteins, the FLAG epitope was used to immunoprecipitate the exogenous protein and kinase assays performed using the GST-CTD32–52 substrate. The surprising result was that there was no change in the CTD-directed kinase activity between the wild-type and kinase-inactive forms of FLAG-CDK11p110 (Fig. 1 B). Two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that the CDK11p110 isoforms do not form dimers or other oligomers (data not shown). Also, a reduction in CTD-directed kinase activity between wild-type and kinase-inactive forms would be expected if the activity seen with the kinase-dead form of FLAG-CDK11p110 were due to additional, active endogenous CDK11p110 kinase in these IP complexes. All of these results suggested that another kinase was present in the CDK11p110 IP complexes. This CTD-directed kinase activity was determined to be DRB-sensitive, with a ∼50% decrease in activity between 10 and 100 μm concentration of DRB (data not shown). Immunoblot analyses performed to detect cyclin K, CDK1, CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, ERK1, ERK2, and ERK3 in CDK11p110immunoprecipitates were all negative (data not shown), indicating that none of these proteins were responsible for this associated kinase activity. A phosphorylated 110-kDa protein band also appeared in these IP kinase assays. The fact that this band appears even in kinase assays using FLAG-immunoprecipitated kinase-inactive forms of CDK11p110 indicated that it was not due to autophosphorylation. IP kinase assays were carried out with several different CDK11p110 FLAG-tagged deletion constructs corresponding to various portions of the CDK11p110 protein to determine whether the CTD-directed kinase activity would co-immunoprecipitate with and phosphorylate these various fusion proteins (see Fig. 2 C for construct diagrams). Protein kinase assays were carried out both in the presence and absence of substrate. The results shown in Fig. 2,A and B, demonstrate that the CTD kinase activity co-immunoprecipitates with the amino-terminal domain of CDK11p110 and phosphorylates a region of CDK11p110 between amino acid residues 92 and 375. The results suggested that an unknown DRB-sensitive protein kinase co-immunoprecipitates with CDK11p110 and that it is this associated protein kinase activity that is responsible for the observed CTD- and CDK11p110-directed phosphorylations. To examine this more carefully, cation exchange chromatography was performed as a first step toward the purification and identification of the unknown DRB-sensitive kinase(s). HeLa nuclear extract was loaded onto a P11 phosphocellulose column, and the proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0.1–1.0 m KCl. Aliquots from the collected fractions were directly assayed by immunoblot for the elution profile of CDK11p110 as well as RNAP II. The CDK11p110protein started to elute from the column around 0.39 m KCl, demonstrated peak elution around 0.89 m KCl, and continued to elute in the 1.0 m KCl buffer (Fig. 3 A). The RNAP II large subunit also eluted from the P11 column beginning around 0.4 m KCl and demonstrated peak elution around 0.6 m KCl. Very little of this protein was eluted by the 1.0 m KCl buffer (data not shown). To test for the presence of the unknown DRB-sensitive protein kinase, column fractions were selected representing the entire range of CDK11p110 elution, and 0.2-ml aliquots were dialyzed into 0.1 m KCl buffer. CDK11p110kinase complexes were then immunoprecipitated from the dialyzed samples using the affinity-purified P2N100 antibody and divided for parallel immunoblot analyses and protein kinase assays. The results are shown in Fig. 3 B. CDK11p110 was recovered from fraction 42, 50, and 58. The CTD-directed kinase activity was present only in fractions 50 and 58. Previously published data led us to believe that the CDK11p110-associated protein kinase might be CK2. First, there are three consensus CK2 phosphorylation sites in the imperfect CTD repeat domain that was phosphorylated but not in the perfect CTD repeat domain that was not phosphorylated. Second, CK2 had previously been reported to phosphorylate the RNAP II CTD (8Payne J.M. Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19621-19629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether CK2α was associated with the CDK11p110 in vivo, the eluted fractions from the P11 column shown in Fig. 3 B were immunoblotted with a human CK2α antibody (Fig. 3 C). As anticipated, CK2α was associated with the CDK11p110 immunoprecipitated from the HeLa lysate, as well as the P11 column fractions that eluted between 0.8 and 1.0m KCl. Conversely, CK2α was not associated with the CDK11p110 protein in the P11 column fractions that eluted at salt concentrations less than 0.8 m KCl. CK2α co-immunoprecipitated with CDK11p110 only in those samples that also demonstrated the CTD directed protein kinase activity. Finally, both the CK2β and CK2α protein kinase subunits co-immunoprecipitate with the CDK11p110 protein kinase isolated from nontransformed human foreskin fibroblast cells (data not shown). Biochemical purification of CDK11p110-containing complexes was undertaken to further characterize proteins associated with CDK11p110. Soluble HeLa cell nuclear extract was subjected to chromatography using a series of columns as outlined in Fig. 3 D. The eluants from these various columns were analyzed to identify the proteins contained in each fraction. CK2α was identified by combined liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis as a CDK11p110-co-purifying protein by assignment of MS2 spectra from nine peptides to the known sequence of CK2α. It may also be of interest to note that CK2α specifically co-purifies with a subpopulation of the CDK11p110-RNAP II complexes that, in a batch elution protocol, elute from the P11 column at 0.8 m KCl and from the DEAE column at 0.5 mKCl. If CK2 is responsible for the phosphorylation of both the RNAP II CTD and the CDK11p110 amino-terminal domain in CDK11p110 IP complexes, then this kinase activity should be inhibited by heparin. Heparin is known to be a rather potent and somewhat specific inhibitor of CK2 activity (23Hathaway G.M. Lubben T.H. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8038-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the ability of DRB to inhibit CK2 has been reported to be variable (24Zandomeni R. Zandomeni M.C. Shugar D. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase assays were carried out following immunoprecipitation of endogenous CDK11p110 and TFIIH. GST-CTD32–52 was added to these kinase reactions along with increasing amounts of heparin. Two formulations of heparin were tested (see “Materials and Methods”), and both were found to be effective at inhibiting CK2 kinase activity. The results shown in Fig. 3 E demonstrate that the kinase activity associated with CDK11P110 and directed against the CTD was inhibited by heparin. In contrast, TFIIH kinase activity directed against the CTD was not inhibited. Heparin also inhibited phosphorylation of endogenous CDK11p110 and the CDK11p110 amino-terminal domain N375-FLAG, which was transiently expressed in HeLa cells and subjected to an IP kinase assay (data not shown). We tested whether ectopic expression of kinase dead CK2α would compete with endogenous CK2α for association with CDK11p110 and thereby reduce the amount of CTD kinase activity in a CDK11p110 IP. The human cell line 293T was transfected with combinations of wild type or D156A kinase-dead (25Korn I. Gutkind S. Srinivasan N. Blundell T.L. Allende C.C. Allende J.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 207-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) CK2α and CK2β. Following expression of the CK2 proteins, the transfected and control cells, which had not been transfected, were subjected to CDK11p110 IP kinase assays using GST-CTD32–52 substrate. The results shown in Fig. 3 F demonstrate that the transfections and IPs were successful and that expression of kinase-dead CK2α significantly reduced the amount of CTD phosphorylation associated with CDK11p110 as compared with wild type. The results also suggest that expression of CK2β is necessary for increased association of ectopically expressed CK2α with CDK11p110. The results further indicate that ectopic CK2β expression alone is sufficient to increase the amount of CTD kinase activity associated with endogenous CDK11p110. Thus, these results reconfirm that CK2 association with CDK11p110 is responsible for a significant amount of the CTD kinase activity in CDK11p110IP complexes. To further map the association between CDK11p110 and CK2, specific CDK11p110 amino-terminal deletion constructs were expressed in cells and examined for the ability to co-immunoprecipitate CK2. Based upon previous studies by Stamm and colleagues (26Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Schwaiger F.W. Obermeier A. Stamm S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3909-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which indicated that the shuttling of the alternative splicing factor YT521B is regulated by both RD/RE repeats in its amino terminus and a poly(E) repeat at its carboxyl terminus, these regions were deleted from CDK11p110. Deletion of the RD/RE (i.e. ΔRE), but not the poly(E) (i.e. ΔE), repeat region resulted in the loss of CDK11p110 and CK2 association as determined by co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4, left panel). In addition, when the CK2 protein kinase did not physically associate with CDK11-N424 in vivo, phosphorylation of the amino-terminal region of CDK11p110 was not observed (Fig. 4,right panel). We consistently observed equal or greater phosphorylation of the CDK11-N424 ΔE protein as compared with the wild-type CDK11p110. It is possible that the deletion of the highly charged glutamic acid repeats improved the ability of CK2 to interact with CDK11p110. Thus, the RE domain of CDK11p110 is at least required for association with CK2. This RE domain is also required for CDK11p110 interaction with RNPS1 and for nuclear speckle localization of CDK11p110. 4J. H. Trembley, R. Gururajan, J. M. Lahti, and V. J. Kidd, unpublished data. CDK11p110 and CK2 do not co-immunoprecipitate usingin vitro transcription and translation products. It is possible that other proteins, factors, or modifications are required for the stable association of these proteins. However, the phosphorylation of CDK11p110 by CK2 suggests that these proteins do interact, at least in an indirect manner. Further characterization of CDK11p110 signaling and protein complexes and the role they play in transcription and RNA processing identified CK2 as a member of the CDK11p110complexes. CK2, a known mediator of cell cycle and transcriptional events (7Egyhazi R. Ossoinak A. Filhol-Cochet O. Cochet C. Pigon A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 149-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Marshak D.R. Russo G.L. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 513-517PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pepperkok R. Lorenz P. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6986-6991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylates the CTD in vitro. In a recent publication, Gottesfeld and co-workers (11Dickinson L.A. Edgar A.J. Ehley J. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25465-25473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a cyclin l-associated kinase activity, attributed to the PITSLRE/CDK11p110 protein kinase, phosphorylated the CTD. Although human CDK11p110 does interact with human cyclin Lin vivo,2,3 we have shown here that CDK11p110 is, in fact, not a CTD kinase. This was demonstrated through the use of several different CDK11p110kinase-inactive tagged mutants from mammalian cells in the in vitro CTD kinase assays, by examining the sensitivity of the CTD kinase to heparin, and by ectopic expression of kinase-dead CK2α. Gottesfeld and co-workers (11Dickinson L.A. Edgar A.J. Ehley J. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25465-25473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) did not use kinase-inactive CDK11p110 controls, resulting in the discrepant conclusion that CDK11p110 kinase activity was responsible for CTD phosphorylation. Rather, as we have shown here, it is the associated activity of CK2 with CDK11p110 in vivo that is most likely responsible for CTD-directed kinase activity. It is still possible that another cyclin L-associated CDK may play a role in CTD phosphorylation as well. The data presented in this report also demonstrate that CK2 phosphorylates the amino-terminal domain of CDK11p110 in vivo. We have identified the RD/RE repeat region of the CDK11p110 amino-terminal domain as an essential component for its association with CK2. In addition, the ΔRE mutation disrupts the ability of the CDK11p110 kinase to properly localize within nuclear structures. 5J. H. Trembley, R. Gururajan, S. Bothner, J. M. Lahti, and V. J. Kidd, unpublished data. CK2 interacts with multiple signaling pathways, and this protein kinase is proposed to be an important mediator of cell survival. Increased CK2 activity is associated with increased cellular proliferation and response to stress, and conversely, loss of CK2 activity is associated with cell death (see Ref. 29Ahmed K. Gerber D.A. Cochet C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 226-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar and references therein). In one case, CK2 is reported to regulate p53 in response to DNA damage. Following UV irradiation, CK2 purifies in a complex with the FACT transcriptional elongation factor and phosphorylates serine 392 of p53, thus enhancing p53 activity (30Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both subunits of FACT co-purified with CDK11p110 and CK2, as identified by both mass spectrometry and immunoblot analysis (data not shown). The data reported here further suggest a role for CK2 in regulating the function of various components of large molecular weight RNA transcription and processing complexes, including CDK11p110, FACT, and RNAP II. The association(s) between CK2 and these proteins as well as their phosphorylation by CK2 may provide further insight into the mechanism(s) involved in CK2 regulation of RNA transcript production.

https://openalex.org/W2041560370,"Biomineralization is an important process in which hard tissues are generated through mineral deposition, often assisted by biomacromolecules. Eggshells, because of their rapid formation via mineralization, are chosen as a model for understanding the fundamentals of biomineralization. This report discusses purification and characterization of various proteins and peptides from goose eggshell matrix. A novel 15-kDa protein (ansocalcin) was extracted from the eggshell matrix, purified, and identified and its role in mineralization evaluated using in vitro crystal growth experiments. The complete amino acid sequence of ansocalcin showed high homology to ovocleidin-17, a chicken eggshell protein, and to C-type lectins from snake venom. The amino acid sequence of ansocalcin was characterized by the presence of acidic and basic amino acid multiplets. In vitro crystallization experiments showed that ansocalcin induced pits on the rhombohedral faces at lower concentrations (<50 μg/ml). At higher concentrations, the nucleation of calcite crystal aggregates was observed. Molecular weight determinations by size exclusion chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed reversible concentration-dependent aggregation of ansocalcin in solution. We propose that such aggregated structures may act as a template for the nucleation of calcite crystal aggregates. Similar aggregation of calcite crystals was also observed when crystallizations were performed in the presence of whole goose eggshell extract. These results show that ansocalcin plays a significant role in goose eggshell calcification."

Chem. 2000; 275: 840-846Google Scholar), while the microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP-1B) interacted with ρ1 and ρ2 and was co-localized with GABAC receptors in the retina (33Hanley J.G.

Importantly, neither GLYT-1 nor MAP-1B interacted with the GABAC receptor ρ3 subunit or GABAAreceptors. Screening a rat brain cDNA-library for proteins binding to the GABAC receptor ρ3 subunit, we identified ZIP3, a new C-terminal splice variant of a protein family interacting with the ζ-isoform of protein kinase C (PKC-ζ; Refs. 37Puls A.

This study identified a new interaction between ZIP3 and GABAC receptors in vitro and postulates the formation of a PKC-ζ/ZIP3/GABAC receptor macromolecular complex. All experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines for the welfare of experimental animals issued by the Federal Government of Germany, the National Institutes of Health, and the Max Planck Society. Unless specified otherwise, all reagents were parts of the MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-hybrid System 3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The large intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 of the rat GABAC receptor ρ3 subunit (TM3-TM4, amino acids 344–445) was PCR-amplified and subcloned in-frame into the EcoRI-BamHI site of the bait vector pGBKT7-BD for expression as a GAL4 fusion protein. Yeast AH109 cells were sequentially transformed with the ρ3 bait vector and 1 mg of a rat brain MATCHMAKER cDNA-library cloned in pGADT7-AD using the lithium acetate method (42Schiestl R.H.

Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) using an automatic DNA sequencer (AbiPrism 377, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and analyzed with protein and nucleotide databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, MD) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST, 44). To map interacting protein domains, PCR-amplified DNA fragments of ZIP3, GABAC, and GABAA receptor subunits (see Fig. 2 for details) were subcloned in bait or prey yeast vectors using the EcoRI-XhoI sites. After generating individual yeast strains expressing the constructs, protein-protein interactions were analyzed by transforming bait strains with pGADT7-constructs and prey strains with pGBKT7-constructs. Activation of the ADE2, HIS3, and β-galactosidase reporter genes was analyzed on selection plates as described above containing 3 mm or 10 mm 3-AT. Transactivation of all constructs was tested using one of the two positive control plasmids pGBKT7–53 or pGADT7-T of the MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-hybrid System 3 (Clontech) encoding for the murine tumor suppressor protein p53 and the SV40 large T-antigen, respectively. Semi-quantitative intensities of protein-protein interactions were calculated according to the “Yeast Protocols Handbook” from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as a substrate. Values are expressed as arbitrary β-galactosidase units and represent the mean of the reporter gene activity of three yeast colonies. Error bars are ± S.E. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). The TM3-TM4 loops of the rat GABAC receptor ρ1–3 subunits, the complete coding sequences of the rat ZIP1–3, and of the rat shaker-type potassium channel Kvβ2 subunit were ligated in-frame to the coding sequence of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in pET-41 or fused to the His tag of pET-30. The coding sequences of ZIP3 and PKC-ζ were tagged with a T7-epitope by cloning in pET-21. Plasmids were transformed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, and protein expression was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside (Sigma). Fusion proteins were purified under native conditions from frozen bacteria pellets by incubating for 30 min in ice-cold lyses buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 25 units/ml Benzonase (Novagen), 1 mg/ml Lysozyme (Sigma) and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and subsequent sonication (6 bursts for 10 s at 300 W). Alternatively, the “BugBuster GST-Bind-Purification Kit” from Novagen was used. GST- and His-tagged fusion proteins were immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose or Ni-NTA beads that were pre-incubated with 0.1% Triton-X100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the binding buffers for GST beads (in mm: 4.3 Na2HPO4, 1.47 KH2PO4, 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, pH 7.3) or Ni-NTA agarose (in mm: 500 NaCl, 20 Tris-HCl, 5 imidazole, pH 7.9). The protein concentration of the coated beads was estimated from a Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany)-stained SDS-PAGE. Similar concentrations of immobilized fusion proteins were incubated with the cytosolic fraction of E. coli expressing T7-tagged ZIP3 or PKC-ζ for 2 h at 4 °C under slow agitation, followed by four washes (GST: 4.3 Na2HPO4, 1.47 KH2PO4, 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.3; Ni-NTA: 500 NaCl, 20 Tris-HCl, 60 imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.9; all concentrations in mm). To obtain comparable conditions in competition experiments, E. coliprotein extracts of similar protein concentrations, as measured at 280 nm, were used. The total volume of these samples was adjusted to 500 μl (defined as 100%) by adding protein extract of non-transfectedE. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-T7 immunserum and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The complete coding sequence of the rat ρ3 subunit was ligated in pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) by PCR cloning techniques. The protein was synthesized using the T7 promoter of the plasmid according to the manuals provided with the RiboMAX RNA Production-Kit (Promega) and the Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) in the presence of 2.4% canine pancreatic microsomal membranes vesicles (Promega) and 0.8 mCi/ml (specific activity >1 mCi/mmol) [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction mixture was incubated with ZIP3 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were washed as described above and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to Hyper film (AmershamBiosciences) for 16 h to 5 days. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293, ATCC CRL1573) were transfected (45Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar) with cDNAs encoding for T7-tagged ZIP3, the ρ3 TM3-TM4 loop fused to GST, or GST alone. Proteins were expressed under control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Cells were lyzed in RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol (Sigma), 25 units/ml Benzonase, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and sedimented for 30 min at 13,200 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 1:4 in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol and mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads (pre-incubated as above) for 5 h at 4 °C. Subsequent washing, elution, and Western blot detection of interacting proteins was performed as described above. Adult rat brains were homogenized on ice in 10 ml/mg tissue of homogenization buffer I (0.32 m saccharose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 10 mg/ml DNaseI and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using a glass/Teflon homogenizer and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting crude membrane pellet was homogenized again in 5 ml/mg tissue of hypotonic homogenization buffer II (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors) to release proteins inside cytosolic vesicles. After centrifugation at 30,000 × gfor 30 min, the supernatant was separated completely from the pellet, which was solubilized in 5 ml/mg tissue of buffer III (20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors) for 2 h. Ultracentrifugation was carried out at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was saved (P2). For binding assays, ∼5 mg of S1 and P2 protein fractions were incubated with beads coated with GST-ZIP3, the His-tagged ρ3 TM3-TM4 loop, or GST and His tags as negative controls for 5 h under slow agitation. Bound proteins were washed, eluted and visualized as described above. All protein preparation steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were used as follows for Western blotting: rabbit anti-PKC-ζ (1:10.000, Sigma), mouse anti-Kvβ2 (1:500, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), goat anti-PICK1 (1:500, N-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and goat anti-PP1γ (1:2000, C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Adult Wistar rats were anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. The posterior eye cups with the retinas attached were immersion-fixed for 15–30 min in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB; 0.1 m, pH 7.4). The retinas were dissected and cryoprotected in 10% (w/v), 20% (w/v) sucrose in PB for 1 h each, and in 30% (w/v) sucrose in PB overnight at 4 °C. Pieces of retinas were mounted in freezing medium (Reichert-Jung, Bensheim, Germany), sectioned vertically at a thickness of 12 μm with a cryostat and processed for immunocytochemistry. The following antibodies were used: a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (1:100) recognizing the ρ1, ρ2, and ρ3 subunits of the rat GABAC receptor (19Enz R. Brandstätter J.H. Wässle H. Bormann J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4479-4490Google Scholar), a mouse monoclonal antibody against PKC-α (1:200; Dunn Labortechnik, Asbach, Germany)-labeling rod bipolar cells, and a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against PKC-ζ (1:10.000; Sigma). In double-labeling immunocytochemical experiments, co-expression of PKC-α and PKC-ζ and of PKC-α and GABAC receptors was examined. The binding sites of the primary antibodies were revealed by the secondary antibodies AlexaTM 594 (red fluorescence) and AlexaTM 488 (green fluorescence) goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) conjugates, respectively (1:500; Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). Double-labeled sections were examined and analyzed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 5 Pascal, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and resulting images were adjusted in brightness and contrast using Adobe PhotoShop 5.5 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Total RNA was extracted from brain, lung, liver, kidney, and spleen using the TRIZOL Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) and from cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, retina, thalamus, and spinal cord of an adult rat following a method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (46Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). For cDNA-synthesis, 3 μg of total RNA were incubated in 20 μl of cDNA-synthesis buffer (in mm: 50 Tris-HCl, 3 MgCl2, 75 KCl, 10 dithiothreitol, pH 8.3), 0.5 mm of each dNTP (AmershamBiosciences), 250 ng of p(dN)6 (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), 20 Units RNasin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 400 units of SuperscriptII RNaseH− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Incubation times were 15 min at room temperature followed by 2 h at 42 °C. PCR amplification was performed with 250 ng of reverse transcribed RNA in 50 μl of PCR-buffer (in mm: 20 Tris-HCl, 50 KCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 0.2 dNTPs, and 0.5 μm each ZIP3 primer (sense 5′-CAGCAAGCTCATCTTTCCcaac-3′, nt 480–501; antisense 5′-CTACTTATGACACTTAAAgcca-3′, nt 684–705), 5 units Taq-polymerase (Invitrogen), pH 8.0) in a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) using the following parameters: 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 30 s and a final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. To compare amounts of RNA isolated from each tissue as well as the efficiency of reverse transcription between RNA samples, a PCR with oligonucleotides recognizing β-actin (sense: 5′-tgagaccttcaacaccccag-3′, nt 372–391; antisense: 5′-gtagacgaccttccacctgt-3′, nt1065–1046) was performed for 25 cycles with the parameters described above. Five microliters of each PCR product were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Controls were treated as above without adding template and/or reverse transcriptase and showed no PCR products. To identify the PCR products, a Southern blot was performed using standard techniques (47Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for ZIP3 (5′-catgggcactttggctggc-3′, nt 559–577), and β-actin (5′-cggtcaggtcatcactatc-3′, nt 732–750) were tailed with DIG-ddUTP, hybridized and detected following the protocol of the “DIG-oligonucleotide Tailing Kit” and the “DIG Luminescent Detection Kit” (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described in the user manuals. To identify proteins that bind to the GABAC receptor ρ3 subunit, a rat brain cDNA library was screened against the intracellular TM3-TM4 loop of this subunit. Of ∼1.9 × 107 transformed yeast cells, 100 yeast colonies were isolated on selection plates and analyzed further. Upon sequencing, clones 56 and 72 were of specific interest since they represented two independent clones coding for an unknown C-terminal splice variant of the PKC-ζ-interacting proteins ZIP1 and ZIP2 (38Geetha T. Wooten M.W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 19-24Google Scholar). Therefore, the protein was termed ZIP3. The N-terminal part of ZIP3 was identical to ZIP1 and ZIP2 and contained a recently characterized acidic putative protein-binding motif described as cdc-homology domain (37Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6191-6196Google Scholar, 39Gong J. Xu J. Bezanilla M. van Huizen R. Derin R. Li M. Science. 1999; 285: 1565-1569Google Scholar), a ZZ-zinc finger domain that also has been associated with protein-protein interactions (48Ponting C.P. Blake D.J. Davies K.E. Kendrick-Jones J. Winder S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 11-13Google Scholar), and two consensus sequences for phosphorylation by PKC (Fig.1 A). However, due to the new C terminus, ZIP3 did not contain the PEST and ubiquitin-associated domains present in ZIP1 and ZIP2 (39Gong J. Xu J. Bezanilla M. van Huizen R. Derin R. Li M. Science. 1999; 285: 1565-1569Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ZIP3-specific C terminus started at the same splice site that is used to generate the ZIP1-specific cassette missing in ZIP2 (Fig. 1 A; Refs. 39Gong J. Xu J. Bezanilla M. van Huizen R. Derin R. Li M. Science. 1999; 285: 1565-1569Google Scholar,49Vadlamudi R.K. Shin J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 138-142Google Scholar). To analyze the distribution of ZIP3, total RNA from different tissues was reverse-transcribed and subjected to PCR amplification. ZIP3 was present at similar levels in all organs analyzed, including the brain (Fig. 1 B). Within the central nervous system, ZIP3 was abundantly expressed in spinal cord, thalamus, cortex, and the retina (Fig. 1 B, right panels). PCR products of similar intensity for β-actin indicated that approximately equal amounts of cDNA from each tissue were used. The highest sequence diversity between GABAC receptor subunits is found in their TM3-TM4 loops. Thus we analyzed whether besides the ρ3 subunit additional subunits of the GABAC or the structurally related GABAAreceptor were able to interact with ZIP3. PCR products representing TM3-TM4 loops were cloned in the bait vector of the yeast two-hybrid system and expressed fusion proteins were analyzed for their ability to interact with ZIP3. Protein-protein interaction was monitored by the ability of transformed yeast cells to grow on selective media, containing 3 mm or 3-AT. To our surprise, TM3-TM4 loops of all three ρ subunits bound ZIP3, with the ρ3 loop showing the highest binding affinity (Fig.2 A, left panel). In contrast to GABAC receptor ρ subunits, no interaction was observed between ZIP3 and subunits of the GABAA receptor (Fig. 2 A, middle panel). The specific interaction of ZIP3 with the ρ subunits of the GABAC receptor allowed the identification of amino acids important for the binding. An alignment of the TM3-TM4 loops of the rat ρ1–3 subunits identified two regions of high similarity, located at the very N- and C-terminal ends of the loops (Fig. 2 B,upper half). To determine the involvement of these regions in ZIP3 binding, subsequent N- and C-terminal deletions were generated in the ρ3 TM3-TM4 loop, and the resulting protein fragments were tested directly for their ability to interact with ZIP3 in yeast cells (Fig. 2 B, lower half) as described above. While amino acid regions located at the C-terminal part of the ρ3 loop showed no binding to ZIP3, 10 amino acids at the very N-terminal part of the loop were sufficient for the interaction (gray background in Fig. 2 B). To analyze if the deletions changed the ρ3 binding affinity for ZIP3, the relative binding strength was estimated using a semi-quantitative β-galactosidase assay. Compared with the binding strength of the complete ρ3 TM3-TM4 loop, the relative ZIP3 binding affinities of the ρ3 constructs decreased slightly with subsequent deletions. Thus, construct ρ3-D3 contained a minimal ZIP3 binding region; however, additional amino acids present in constructs ρ3-D1 and ρ3-D2, which are absent in the TM3-TM4 loops of ρ1 and ρ2, support the interaction. This result is consistent with our finding that all three ρ subunits did interact with ZIP3 and that ρ3 showed a higher binding strength than ρ1 and ρ2 (Fig. 2 A, left panel). To map the location of amino acids that would act in combination with the 10 amino acids of the ρ3-D3 construct, we generated three additional deletions of the ρ3 TM3-TM4 loop. Upon deletion of the first 10 amino acids (construct ρ3-D6), the binding affinity for ZIP3 was reduced by about 50%, indicating that this domain is an important but not the only mediator for the interaction between ρ3 and ZIP3. When the first 10 amino acids were used in combination with more C-terminal domains of the ρ3 TM3-TM4 loop (constructs ρ3-D7 and ρ3-D8), the binding strength increased to values comparable with the wild-type sequence. Next, regions of ZIP3 were analyzed for their capability to bind the ρ3 TM3-TM4 loop, again using a strategy of subsequent deletions. The ZIP3/ρ3 interaction was mediated by the ZZ-zinc finger and a C-terminal adjacent protein region (amino acids 119–221,gray background in Fig. 2 C), while the ZIP3-specific C terminus and the cdc-homology region were not involved in the binding. Dividing the interacting protein region in two parts resulted in a reduction in binding affinities (constructs ZIP3-D2 and ZIP3-D7). However, interaction with ρ3 was still present, indicating that amino acids in both protein regions contribute to the binding site in a synergistic manner. Indeed, the ZZ-zinc finger domain alone (construct ZIP3-D9) was able to bind the ρ3 TM3-TM4 loop at a binding intensity similar to those of constructs ZIP3-D2 and ZIP3-D7. Several proteins have been described in the literature to physically interact with ZIP1 or ZIP2, including PKC-ζ, shaker-type potassium channel β subunits, or the ZIP proteins themselves (37Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6191-6196Google Scholar, 39Gong J. Xu J. Bezanilla M. van Huizen R. Derin R. Li M. Science. 1999; 285: 1565-1569Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the binding characteristics of the newly identified member of the ZIP protein family, ZIP3. Immobilized GST fusion proteins were incubated with E. coli protein extracts and bound proteins were analyzed in Western blots. Unspecific interactions were excluded using immobilized GST. ZIP3 bound specifically to ZIP1, ZIP2, and ZIP3 and to the TM3-TM4 loops of the ρ1, ρ2, and ρ3 subunits (Fig.3 A), consistent with the results obtained from the yeast two-hybrid experiments. Furthermore, ZIP3 interacted with Kvβ2 (Fig. 3 A) and with PKC-ζ (Fig.3 B). Since the N-terminal regions of ZIP1, ZIP2, and ZIP3 are identical, our data indicate that the ZIP dimerization domain and the binding regions for PKC-ζ and Kvβ2 are located in the N termini. Indeed, the region important for dimerization and binding of ZIP1 to PKC-ζ was mapped to the cdc-homology region (see Fig. 1; Refs. 37Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6191-6196Google Scholar, 39Gong J. Xu J. Bezanilla M. van Huizen R. Derin R. Li M. Science. 1999; 285: 1565-1569Google Scholar, 41Sanz L. Diaz-Meco M.T. Naka"

However, the responsible intracellular signaling pathways triggered by thrombin are still not well defined. We report here that thrombin rapidly and transiently induces activation of protein kinase D (PKD) in aortic smooth muscle cells. Our data demonstrate that protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors completely block thrombin-induced PKD activation, suggesting that thrombin induces PKD activation via a PKC-dependent pathway. Furthermore, our results show that thrombin rapidly induces PKCδ phosphorylation and that the PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin blocks thrombin-induced PKD activation, suggesting that PKCδ mediates the thrombin-induced PKD activation. Using dominant negative approaches, we demonstrated that expression of a dominant negative PKCδ inhibits the phosphorylation and activation of PKD induced by thrombin, whereas neither PKCε nor PKCζ affects thrombin-induced PKD activation. In addition, our results of co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that PKD forms a complex with PKCδ in smooth muscle cells. Taken together, the findings of the present study demonstrate that thrombin induces activation of PKD and reveal a novel role of PKCδ in mediating thrombin-induced PKD activation in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Bjorklid E. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2001; 27: 605-617Google Scholar, 2Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Google Scholar). Thrombin also exerts direct effects on cells to regulate platelet aggregation, endothelial cell activation, and smooth muscle cell (SMC)1 proliferation via interactions with members of the protease-activated receptor (PAR) family, such as PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4, known as G-protein-coupled receptors (2Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Google Scholar, 3Patterson C. Stouffer G.A. Madamanchi N. Runge M.S. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 987-997Google Scholar). However, the intracellular signaling cascades downstream from the thrombin receptors are surprisingly complex and are still not well understood. Protein kinase D (PKD), also known as protein kinase Cμ (4Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Google Scholar, 5Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Google Scholar), is a newly described serine/threonine protein kinase with unique structural, enzymological, and regulatory properties that are different from those of the PKC family members. The most distinct characteristics of PKD are the presence of a catalytic domain distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases, a pleckstrin homology domain within the regulatory region, and a highly hydrophobic stretch of amino acids in its N-terminal region (6Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Google Scholar, 7Lint J.V. Rykx A. Vantus T. Vandenheede J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 577-581Google Scholar). PKD can be activated by a variety of stimuli including biologically active phorbol esters, growth factors, and T- and B-cell receptor agonists via PKC-dependent pathways (6Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Google Scholar, 7Lint J.V. Rykx A. Vantus T. Vandenheede J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 577-581Google Scholar). PKD activation appears to involve the phosphorylation of Ser-744 and Ser-748 within the activation loop of the catalytic domain as well as the autophosphorylation of Ser-916 (6Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Google Scholar). PKD has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions including NFκB-mediated gene expression, Na+/H+ antiport activity, Golgi organization and function, and protein transport (7Lint J.V. Rykx A. Vantus T. Vandenheede J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 577-581Google Scholar, 8Baron C.L. Malhotra V. Science. 2002; 295: 325-328Google Scholar). The aim of the present study is to determine whether and how thrombin activates PKD in living cells. Our results demonstrate that thrombin rapidly and markedly induces PKD activation in SMC. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the following: 1) a PKCδ-specific inhibitor inhibits thrombin-induced activation of PKD; 2) overexpression of a dominant negative PKCδ abolishes PKD activation; and 3) PKCδ interacts with PKD. PKC has been implicated in many cellular responses to thrombin (9Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Uddin S., Xu, N., Ye, R.D. Platanias L.C. Malik A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5554-5565Google Scholar, 10Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Google Scholar, 11Xu Y. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23887-23890Google Scholar). Despite the importance of PKC in thrombin-induced signal transduction, the downstream targets of PKC in the signaling cascades remain largely undefined. Thus, our finding that thrombin induces PKCδ-dependent PKD activation reveals a novel thrombin-induced signaling pathway in living cells. Reagents were obtained as follows: thrombin from Sigma; protein kinase inhibitors Ro 31-8220, U-0126, GF 109203X, SB-203580, LY294002, and rottlerin from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); antibodies against PKCε and PKCδ from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA); an antibody against PKCζ from Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA); antibodies against PKD and phospho-PKCε from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and antibodies against phospho-PKC isoforms (δ and ζ) and phospho-PKD (phosphorylated Ser-744/Ser-748 and phosphorylated Ser-916) from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated from explants of excised aortas of rats and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (12Cui M.Z. Penn M.S. Chisolm G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32795-32802Google Scholar). The SMC between passages 6 and 17 were used in this study. Adenoviruses encoding mouse PKC isotypes (δ, ε, or ζ) were constructed as previously described (13Ohba M. Ishino K. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S. Chida K. Huh N.H. Kuroki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5199-5207Google Scholar, 14Matsumoto M. Ogawa W. Hino Y. Furukawa K. Ono Y. Takahashi M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14400-14406Google Scholar). SMC were infected for 24 h with either wild type or dominant negative PKC isotypes. SMC or SMC infected with virus expression vectors were serum-starved in a serum-free medium for 24 h prior to treatment with thrombin. After treatment with thrombin, the cells were lysed and were subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis as described previously (15Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Google Scholar). PKD autophosphorylation was determined as described previously (15Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Google Scholar). To examine whether thrombin induces PKD activation in living cells, we first performed an IVK assay to determine the autophosphorylation activity of PKD. Serum-starved rat aortic SMC were exposed to 0.1 unit/ml thrombin for various periods of time, the cells were lysed, and PKD was immunoprecipitated with a PKD-specific antibody. The resulting immunocomplexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, and the incorporation of 32P into PKD was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1 A, stimulation of the SMC with thrombin resulted in a striking activation of PKD, which was detected after 45 s of thrombin stimulation and reached a peak at 2–4 min. Thrombin-induced PKD activation also was determined by using two recently available phospho-PKD-specific antibodies that recognize phosphorylated Ser-916 as well as phosphorylated Ser-744 and Ser-748 of PKD. The residues Ser-744 and Ser-748 in the activation loop of PKD have been identified as critical phosphorylation sites in PKD activation induced by phorbol esters, and Ser-916 is autophosphorylated when PKD is activated (6Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Google Scholar). By using these antibodies, we observed that thrombin rapidly and transiently induced PKD phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). Reportedly, PKD is activated in PKC-dependent fashion (6Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 382-390Google Scholar). To determine whether PKC activation is involved in thrombin-induced PKD activation in SMC, we examined the effect of two PKC inhibitors, GF 109203X and Ro 31-8220, on PKD activation stimulated by thrombin. Serum-starved SMC were treated with GF 109203X and Ro 31-8220 for 40 min prior to a 3-min exposure to thrombin (0.1 unit/ml). As shown in Fig. 2, GF 109203X at a concentration as low as 0.5 μm completely blocked PKD activation (left panels). Thrombin-induced PKD phosphorylation also was blocked by Ro 31-8220 in a concentration-dependent fashion (middle panels). These data suggest that PKC is involved in the thrombin-stimulated PKD activation. We also examined whether MEK inhibitor U-0126, phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002, or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB-203580 affects the activation of PKD. As shown, none of these inhibitors had any effect on thrombin-induced PKD activation (right panels of Fig. 2). These results suggest that PKC but not MEK, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is required for thrombin-induced PKD activation in SMC. The finding that PKC activation is involved in thrombin-induced PKD activation prompted us to determine which isotype of PKC is required for PKD activation. Previous studies of SMC have shown that PKCα, PKCβ, PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCζ are expressed in SMC (16Assender J.W. Kontny E. Fredholm B.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 76-80Google Scholar, 17Dixon B.S. Sharma R.V. Dickerson T. Fortune J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1406-C1420Google Scholar, 18Morgan K.G. Leinweber B.D. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 495-505Google Scholar, 19Pang L. Nie M. Corbett L. Donnelly R. Gray S. Knox A.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1435-1437Google Scholar), and among them, PKCδ is most abundantly expressed in rat aortic SMC (20Fukumoto S. Nishizawa Y. Hosoi M. Koyama H. Yamakawa K. Ohno S. Morii H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13816-13822Google Scholar). We first determined which PKC was activated by thrombin in SMC. As shown in Fig. 3 A, phosphorylation of PKCδ was rapidly induced at 45 s upon thrombin treatment of the SMC; in contrast, no thrombin-induced phosphorylation of PKCα, PKCβ, PKCε, or PKCζ was detected (Fig. 3 A). We next examined whether activation of PKCδ contributed to thrombin-induced PKD activation by determining the effect of the PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin on thrombin-induced PKD activation. Rottlerin has been reported to inhibit selectively PKCδ activation (IC50 = 3–6 μm) 5–10-fold more potently than PKCα and PKCβ and 13–33-fold more potently than PKCε, PKCζ, and PKCη (21Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Google Scholar). The SMC were pretreated with rottlerin for 40 min followed by stimulation with thrombin for 3 min. As shown in Fig. 3 B, rottlerin inhibited thrombin-triggered PKD activation in a concentration-dependent fashion. These results suggest that thrombin-induced PKD activation is dependent on PKCδ activity in SMC. To substantiate further the role of PKCδ in mediating thrombin-induced PKD activation in living cells, we examined the effect of the dominant negative form of PKCδ on thrombin-induced PKD activation. The dominant negative nature of the ATP-binding site mutant PKCδ has been previously characterized (22Li W. Michieli P. Alimandi M. Lorenzi M.V., Wu, Y. Wang L.H. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 731-737Google Scholar). We used recombinant adenovirus constructs to overexpress specific PKC isoforms in SMC and to determine the effects of these dominant negative isoforms of PKC on thrombin-induced cellular PKD activation. As shown in Fig. 4, A–C, infection of the SMC with adenovirus constructs containing cDNAs for wild type or dominant negative PKCs resulted in robust expression of these PKC isoforms. As shown in Fig. 4 A, at a multiplicity of infection of 30, infection of the SMC with an adenovirus construct that encodes the dominant negative PKCδ almost completely blocked thrombin-induced PKD activation as determined by an IVK assay and by measuring PKD phosphorylation at Ser-744/Ser-748 and Ser-916, whereas wild type PKCδ had no detectable effect on thrombin-induced PKD activation when compared with the effect of non-infected controls. In contrast, neither dominant negative PKCε and PKCζ nor wild type PKCε and PKCζ, at the same multiplicity of infection, affected PKD activation (Fig. 4, B and C). These data further indicate that PKCδ mediates thrombin-induced PKD activation in SMC. The above results indicated that PKCδ functionally mediates PKD activation in response to thrombin. We further asked whether PKCδ physically interacts with PKD in SMC. To address this question, we infected SMC with an adenovirus vector encoding PKCδ, PKCε, or PKCζ at the same multiplicity of infection. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKD antibody. The resulting immunocomplexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and were probed with PKCδ-, PKCε-, or PKCζ-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5 A, PKCδ was co-immunoprecipitated with PKD in living cells. In addition, we also observed that, consistent with the observation reported previously (15Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Google Scholar), PKCε, but not PKCζ, was co-immunoprecipitated with PKD (Fig. 5, B and C). It should be noted that although both PKCδ and PKCε physically interact with PKD in SMC, only PKCδ functionally mediates thrombin-induced PKD activation in aortic SMC. Thrombin has many important biological effects on the vascular wall. Though much has been learned during the last decade about the cell-surface receptors of thrombin, the intracellular signaling cascades, especially the early signal transduction mediators responsible for the action of thrombin on cells, are still not well understood. The results presented here have demonstrated that thrombin induces a remarkable activation of PKD in living cells. Stimulation of aortic SMC with thrombin leads to a rapid and transient activation of PKD, occurring within seconds of thrombin stimulation of aortic SMC. Interestingly, PKD is activated more rapidly than other kinase cascades induced by thrombin, including Elk1 (23Li Q.J. Vaingankar S. Sladek F.M. Martins-Green M. Blood. 2000; 96: 3696-3706Google Scholar), NFκB (24Mari B. Imbert V. Belhacene N. Far D.F. Peyron J.F. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Rossi B. Auberger P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8517-8523Google Scholar), and nuclear diacylglycerol kinase θ (25Bregoli L. Baldassare J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23288-23295Google Scholar). Thus, PKD activation is one of the earliest events induced by thrombin in living cells. Our results revealed a novel signaling pathway in which PKCδ mediates thrombin-induced PKD activation. To date, the role of PKCδ in PKD activation is totally unknown, and although thrombin has been shown to activate PKCδ in several types of cells (9Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Uddin S., Xu, N., Ye, R.D. Platanias L.C. Malik A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5554-5565Google Scholar, 26Moussazadeh M. Haimovich B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 225-230Google Scholar, 27Maulon L. Mari B. Bertolotto C. Ricci J.E. Luciano F. Belhacene N. Deckert M. Baier G. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1964-1972Google Scholar), the downstream target of PKCδ is still unclear. Our data established for the first time that thrombin-induced PKD activation is mediated by PKCδ in vascular SMC. We employed multiple approaches to address the specificity of the PKCδ function in mediating thrombin-induced PKD activation. The general PKC inhibitors GF 109203X and Ro 31-8220 blocked thrombin-induced PKD activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2), suggesting that thrombin induces PKD activation through a PKC-dependent pathway. The fact that thrombin induced the activation of PKCδ and that the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin blocked thrombin-induced PKD activation in a concentration-dependent manner strongly suggests the functional involvement of PKCδ in thrombin-induced PKD activation in SMC (Fig. 3). To substantiate further the role of PKC, we employed the dominant negative approach by using the adenovirus expression system to express the wild type and dominant negative forms of PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCζ in SMC. Our results revealed that overexpression of the dominant negative PKCδ almost completely blocks thrombin-induced PKD activation. In contrast, neither PKCε nor PKCζ affects thrombin-induced PKD activation (Fig. 4). Together, these data revealed a novel role of PKCδ in mediating thrombin-induced PKD activation in living cells. In addition, our results also demonstrate the formation of a complex between PKCδ and PKD in SMC, suggesting that PKCδ mediates thrombin-induced PKD activation through its direct interaction with PKD. Notably, PKCε was also found to form a complex with PKD (Fig. 5) (15Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Google Scholar). However, PKCε is not functionally involved in thrombin-induced PKD activation. This finding provides further support of the specific role of PKCδ in mediating thrombin-induced PKD activation in SMC. Based on the observations that PKD kinase activity was enhanced upon transient coexpression with constitutively active PKCη, PKCε, and PKCθ, each of which is a novel PKC, recent studies have suggested that PKCη, PKCε, and PKCθ may function as potential upstream kinases and may account for the PKC-dependent activation of PKD (28Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Google Scholar, 29Yuan J. Bae D. Cantrell D. Nel A.E. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 444-452Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, the functional relationship between endogenous novel PKCs (PKCη, PKCε, and PKCθ) and PKD in intact cells responding to extracellular stimuli has not yet been established. Moreover, there is no information about the potential role of PKCδ, another member of the novel PKC family, in PKD activation. Very recently, Stafford et al. (30Stafford, M. J., Watson, S. P., and Pears, C. J. (2003)Blood, in pressGoogle Scholar) reported that thrombin induces PKD activation in platelets in a PKC-dependent pathway. However, the specific PKC isotype, which mediates thrombin-induced PKD activation in platelets, has not been identified. Therefore, our findings that thrombin induces PKD activation via a PKCδ-dependent pathway in SMC open a new avenue to study the biological function of PKD and PKCδ in living cells. In summary, our study demonstrated that thrombin activates PKD in SMC. Furthermore, our results revealed a novel function of PKCδ in mediating PKD activation induced by thrombin. In addition, our experiments also provide for the first time evidence of a complex formation between PKCδ and PKD. The present findings identified PKD as a new component in the thrombin-induced intracellular signaling pathway in SMC, and this discovery may implicate PKD in mediating the biological responses induced by thrombin in SMC.

However, mechanisms regulating annexin II transport across the cellular membrane are unknown. In this study, we used coimmunoprecipitation to show that Annexin-II was bound to insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors in PC12 cells and NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing insulin (NIH-3T3IR) or IGF-1 receptor (NIH-3T3IGF-1R). Stimulation of insulin and IGF-1 receptors by insulin caused a temporary dissociation of annexin II from these receptors, which was accompanied by an increased amount of extracellular annexin II detected in the media of PC12, NIH-3T3IR, and NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells but not in that of untransfected NIH-3T3 cells. Activation of a different growth factor receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, did not produce such results. Tyrphostin AG1024, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of insulin and IGF-1 receptor, was shown to inhibit annexin II secretion along with reduced receptor phosphorylation. Inhibitors of a few downstream signaling enzymes including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, pp60c-Src, and protein kinase C had no effect on insulin-induced annexin II secretion, suggesting a possible direct link between receptor activation and annexin II secretion. Immunocytochemistry revealed that insulin also induced transport of the membrane-bound form of annexin II to the outside layer of the cell membrane and appeared to promote cell aggregation. These results suggest that the insulin receptor and its signaling pathways may participate in molecular mechanisms mediating annexin II secretion.

Hofmann A. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 177-183PubMed Google Scholar). It is found in cells as a 36-kDa monomer and a 94-kDa heterotetramer (AII94) made of two 36-kDa monomers (AII36) and two molecules of an 11-kDa (AII11) S100 protein (2Weber K. Moss S.E. The Annexins. Portland Press, London1992: 61-68Google Scholar). Like all annexins, AII contains a conserved protein core domain that comprises four repeated segments of about 70 amino acids each and is resistant to limited proteolysis. The N terminus of AII contains, as identified by bothin vivo and in vitro studies, a serine phosphorylation site (Ser-25) for protein kinase C, a tyrosine phosphorylation site (Tyr-23) for pp60-Src, and a binding site for AII11 (2Weber K. Moss S.E. The Annexins. Portland Press, London1992: 61-68Google Scholar, 3Gould K.L. Woodgett J.R. Isacke C.M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

Phosphorylation of AII by protein kinase C at this domain has been shown to regulate interaction of the AII heavy chain with the AII light chain (6Jost M. Gerke V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Johnstone S.A. Hubaishy I. Waisman D.M. J. Biol.

Signalling. 1991; 2: 265-276Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, tyrosine phosphorylation of AII in vitro by pp60c-Src has been shown to play a negative regulatory role in AII's binding to and bundling of F-actin and formation of the annexin II heterotetramer complex with plasma membrane (12Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of AII contains binding sites for Ca2+, phospholipids, and F-actin (8Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Initially identified as an intracellular molecule, AII has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes including Ca2+-evoked exocytosis. AII is highly enriched in chromaffin granule preparations, is able to aggregate chromaffin vesicles in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and partially restores the secretory response in permeabilized chromaffin cells (14Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). AII-regulated exocytosis appears to be associated with formation of the heterotetramer AII94. AII has also been suggested to play a role in endocytosis. It is associated with endosomal membranes and is one of the few proteins transferred from a donor to an acceptor endosomal membrane in an in vitrofusion assay (15Emans N. Gorvel J.P. Walter C. Gerke V. Kellner R. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The binding of AII to endosomes appears to be Ca2+-independent but requires an intact N-terminal domain (16Jost M. Zeuschner D. Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other intracellular functions that involve AII include immunoglobulin transport (17Kristoffersen E.K. Matre R. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1996; 36: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and ion channel activity (18Burger A. Berendes R. Liemann S. Benz J. Hofmann A. Gottig P. Huber R. Gerke V. Thiel C. Romisch J. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition to its intracellular functions, AII is secreted into the extracellular environment in both soluble and membrane-bound forms (19Siever D.A. Erickon H.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although the detailed functions of extracellular AII are not fully understood, AII is known to interact with matrix proteins and specific proteases to regulate plasminogen activation, cell migration, and cell adhesion (20Hajjar K.A. Krishnan S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Tressler R.J. Updyke T.V. Yeatman T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For example, AII acts as a receptor for the secreted serine proteases plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator on the endothelial cell surface and thereby triggers generation of plasmin (20Hajjar K.A. Krishnan S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, through interaction with extracellular matrix proteins such as tenascin-C (23Chung C.Y. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Erickson H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) or certain collagens (24Kirsch T. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Nah H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35577-35583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), AII appears to play a role in mediating cell focal adhesion, migration, and mineralization of growth plate cartilage. Furthermore, extracellular and membrane-bound AII may play a significant role in tumor invasion and metastasis. On the surface of metastatic lymphoma cells, AII enhances adhesion of these cells to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (21Tressler R.J. Updyke T.V. Yeatman T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the surface of tumor cells, the AII heterotetramer interacts with cathepsin B, a cysteine protease that is secreted into the extracellular environment and plays a prominent role in tumor development and invasion (25Poole A.R. Tiltman K.J. Recklies A.D. Stoker T.A. Nature. 1978; 273: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Recklies A.D. Tiltman K.J. Stoker T.A. Poole A.R. Cancer Res. 1980; 3: 550-556Google Scholar). Interaction of AII with cathepsin B may facilitate a proteolytic cascade in the extracellular matrix that selectively degrades extracellular matrix proteins (27Mai J. Waisman D.M. Sloane B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because AII lacks a signal peptide and cannot be secreted through conventional endoplasmic reticulum secretory pathways, the mechanism(s) by which AII is secreted are currently unknown. Identification of molecules that participate in transporting AII to the extracellular matrix will be useful for understanding the role of AII in adhesion and mineralization. It was recently reported that Tyr phosphorylation sites located on the N terminus of AII can be phosphorylated by the insulin (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (28Biener Y. Feinstein R. Mayak M.

Normal NIH-3T3 cells (nontransfected mouse fibroblasts) and NIH-3T3 cells stably transfected with human insulin receptor (NIH-3T3IR) or insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (NIH-3T3IGF-1R) (30Quon M.J.

Rat PC12 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated (10 μg/ml) T25 plastic flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For immunocytochemistry experiments, cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated 10-mm glass coverslips (Carolina Biomedicals, Inc.). Once NIH-3T3, NIH-3T3IR, NIH-3T3IGF-1R, and PC12 cells were over 95% confluent in culture dishes, they were “starved” in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium at about 15 min prior to insulin treatment. Cells were treated with different concentrations of insulin or PDGF (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 3 min for most experiments except for the time course experiment in which cells were treated with 100 nm insulin for various times ranging from 0 to 60 min. When treated with different inhibitors, cells were preincubated with 50 μm IR tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1024 (Alexis Biochemicals) for 30 min, 100 nm PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Sigma) for 90 min, PP1 (kindly provided by Dr. Anthony Bishop of Princeton University), and bisindolylmaleimide I (BiSM-1; Alexis Biochemicals) for 15 min. After preincubation, cells were given another dose of each inhibitor immediately prior to insulin treatment. At the end of the insulin or PDGF stimulation, the culture media were rapidly transferred to labeled tubes, to which a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1%. Cells were briefly rinsed with precooled PBS and frozen by placing the dishes in liquid nitrogen. Cells were then thawed on ice and harvested in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing 1 mm vanadate and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After incubation on ice for 40 min, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C to pellet the remaining cellular debris. The supernatants were collected and kept at −70 °C for further biochemical experiments. The interaction of AII with IR and IGF-1R was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation. In these experiments, IR or IGF-1R was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate by incubating an equal amount of lysate (200 μg) with either anti-IR or anti-IGF-1R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibody in lysis buffer at 4 °C on a rotating wheel overnight, followed by the addition of protein A-agarose and incubation for another 2 h. The immunocomplex was washed two times with lysis buffer and one time with washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). After boiling in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min, samples were resolved on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Novex, Inc.) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Following incubation with PBST (PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% low fat milk to block nonspecific binding sites, the membrane was incubated with an anti-AII antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight and then with a secondary antibody (Sigma). The immunoreactive signal was revealed in a chemiluminescent process using an ECL reagent (Pierce). To verify the protein-protein interaction, AII was also immunoprecipitated with anti-AII antibody, and the coprecipitated proteins were identified on a Western blot with anti-IR, anti-IGF-1R, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, respectively. In addition, the amount of protein immunoprecipitated by their own primary antibodies was routinely measured on Western blots. To detect the activation of IR and IGF-1R in the cells treated with insulin, the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Py20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and the phosphorylated form of IR or IGF-1R from the immunoprecipitation was revealed by immunoblotting with either anti-IR or IGF-1R antibody (32Zhao W.Q. Chen H., Xu, H. Moore E. Meiri N. Quon M.J. Alkon D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 49: 34893-34902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Alternatively, phosphorylation of these receptors was measured directly on Western blots with an anti-phospho-IR/IGF-1R antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) that specifically recognizes the Tyr(P)-1146 of IR and the Tyr(P)-1131 of IGF-1R. Similar methods were used for detecting phosphorylations of Akt and Erk1/2 with specific antibodies that recognize phospho-Akt (Ser-473) or phospho-Erk1/2. Levels of immunoreactive signals for phosphorylated proteins were then normalized against that for the total amount of each corresponding protein, which was revealed with an anti-regular form of the protein. Tyrosine phosphorylation of AII36 was examined by immunoprecipitation of AII with an anti-AII36 antibody, followed by detection of phospho-AII36 on Western blots with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Py20). The overnight culture medium was replaced with fresh medium about 15 min prior to insulin treatment. Cells were stimulated with 100 nm of insulin at 37 °C for 3 min, and the culture medium was rapidly collected at the end of the reaction. Control cells were added in the same volume of lymphocyte buffer that was used to dilute insulin. The collected medium was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 3 min to pellet any possible suspended cells or debris in the medium. The supernatant medium was collected, and the same volume of the medium from each condition was concentrated using the YM-10 Centricon (Millipore Corp.). After treatment with SDS-sample buffer, the same amount of concentrated sample was resolved on a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel, and the secreted AII36 was detected on Western blots by anti-AII36 antibody. The nontreated and insulin-treated cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 5 min. After the cells were washed three times with PBS, they were permeabilized with 1% Triton-X100 in PBS (pH 7.4), and the nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% normal horse serum in PBS (pH 7.4). Cells were then double stained with either anti-AII/anti-IR or anti-AII/anti-IGF-1R antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. The dilution of these antibodies was 1:100–200. After the cells were washed three times with PBS, a secondary anti-goat IgG conjugated with Texas Red (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein (Vector Laboratories) were added to the cells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. The cells were then washed three times, sealed with VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories) and observed under a confocal microscope. The immunoreactive signals from Western blots were quantified using the NIH Image analyzing program. For experiments measuring protein phosphorylation using anti-phospho-protein antibodies, ratios of immunoreactive signals between the phosphorylated and total amounts of each particular protein were calculated. Signals from insulin-treated cells were converted to the percentage of the control cells, and values from at least three independent experiments were subjected to either a two-tailed t test or one-way analysis of variance. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The NIH-3T3IR and NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells expressed similar levels of AII36 to those in normal NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 1 A), indicating that overexpression of IR or IGF1-R had no effect on the expression of AII36. In the coimmunoprecipitation experiment, a substantial amount of AII3coimmunoprecipitated with both IR and IGF-1R from NIH-3T3IRand NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells under nonstimulated conditions (INS −) (Fig. 1 B-1). Once cells were treated with 100 nm insulin (INS +) for 3 min; however, the amount of AII36 “pulled down” by IR or IGF-1R was markedly reduced (Fig. 1 B-1). Statistical analysis of data from three independent replications indicated a highly significant effect of insulin treatment (p < 0.001). The reduced amount of AII36 coimmunoprecipitated with IR and IGF-1R was not due to a decrease in the amount of IR and IGF-1R precipitated by the antibodies, since similar amounts of IR and IGF-1R were detected from the precipitated samples (Fig. 1 B-2). This result was confirmed by a reversed immunoprecipitation experiment, in which an anti-AII antibody was used during precipitation, followed by detection of IR and IGF-1R on Western blots with anti-IR or anti-IGF-1R antibodies. Again, although a similar amount of AII36 was precipitated by the anti-AII antibody (Fig. 1 B-4), significantly less IR and IGF-1R were coprecipitated with AII36 after insulin stimulation (Fig. 1 B-3). In addition to the mature IGF-1R, the IGF-1R precursor with a relative molecular mass of 180-kDa was also “pulled down” with AII36, suggesting that AII36 interacts with both the mature receptor and the precursor. To test the specificity of IR/AII and IGF-1R/AII coprecipitation, we performed several control experiments in which the normal rabbit and goat IgG were employed in the immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 1 C, in neither NIH-3T3IR nor NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells was AII36 “pulled down” by the normal rabbit IgG (Fig. 1 C-1). Similarly, neither IR nor IGF-1R was found in precipitated samples using the normal goat IgG (Fig. 1 C-2). We also examined another member of the annexin family, annexin VI, on Western blots following immunoprecipitation with anti-IR and anti-IGF-1R antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 C-3, annexin VI was expressed in both NIH-3T3IR and NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells with a higher abundance in the latter. The expression levels of annexin VI were not affected by INS treatment. Unlike AII36, no annexin VI was coimmunoprecipitated with IR or IGF-1R (Fig. 1 C-4). These results suggest that AII36 specifically interacts with IR and IGF-1R. To test whether coprecipitation of AII36 with IR and IGF-1R from NIH-3T3IR and NIH-3T3IGF-1Rcells was due to an effect of overexpression of these receptors, we next examined interactions of AII36 with endogenous IR and IGF-1R in rat PC12 cells. Unlike IR and IGF-1R that were overexpressed in NIH-3T3 cells, IR and IGF-1R were expressed in PC12 cells with markedly different abundance. Fig. 2 A shows that levels of immunoreactive signals for IR from NIH-3T3IR cells and of IGF-1R from NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells were closely correlated with amounts of the protein resolved on SDS-PAGE (open circle, NIH-3T3IR; filled circle, NIH-3T3IGF-1R). Since only a negligible level of immunoreactive signals for IR and IGF-1R was detected from nontransfected NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 2 A, NIH-3T3-1and NIH-3T3-2), signals detected by anti-IR and -IGF-1R antibodies from NIH-3T3IR and NIH-3T3IGF-1Rcells should mainly reflect levels of each overexpressed receptor. In PC12 cells, the relative amount of IGF-1R was about 4 times higher than that of IR (open square, PC12-IR;filled square, PC12-IGF-1R). Consistent with that observed in NIH-3T3IR and NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells, a substantial amount of AII36 was coprecipitated with IR or IGF-1R from PC12 cells, which was also significantly decreased (p < 0.001) upon insulin treatment (Fig. 2 B). It should be noted that although PC12 cells expressed high levels of IGF-1R, the relative amount of AII36coprecipitated with IGF-1R under basal conditions was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than that with IR. AII36 is known to be secreted into the extracellular matrix as both soluble and membrane-bound forms, although the mechanism(s) and molecular pathway(s) underlying its secretion have not been identified. In order to understand the physiological significance of AII/IR and AII/IGF-1R interactions and subsequent molecular events of the disassociation of AII from these receptors, we investigated AII secretion from the NIH-3T3, NIH-3T3IR, NIH-3T3IGF-1R, and PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, no AII36 was detected in the culture medium from untransfected NIH-3T3 cells under both basal conditions and after insulin stimulation. In the NIH-3T3IR, NIH-3T3IGF-1R, and PC12 cells, however, AII36 was found in the culture medium. The amount of AII36 in the culture media from these cells was markedly increased following insulin stimulation (p < 0.001, t test) under those conditions. Fig. 3, B-1 and B-3, shows activation of IR and IGF-1R by insulin in a dose-dependent manner as indicated by the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors. These receptors were not activated by PDGF. When treated with insulin for 3 min, the amount of extracellular AII36 from NIH-3T3IR cells was also shown to be insulin dose-dependent and correlated with phosphorylation levels of IR. The insulin-induced extracellular AII36 from NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells, however, remained at a similar level when insulin concentration was increased from 1 to 100 nm(Fig. 3 B-4). No AII36 was detected in the culture media from the PDGF-treated NIH-3T3IR and NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells (Fig. 3, B-2 andB-4). In addition, no annexin VI was detected in the culture media under similar conditions (data not shown). When cells were treated with the IR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1024, phosphorylation of IR and IGF-1R were both inhibited (Fig. 3 C-1), along with a substantial reduction of the amount of AII36 in the culture media (Fig. 3 C-2). However, when cells were treated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, which abolished the insulin-induced activation of Akt (Fig. 3 D), neither the insulin-induced phosphorylation of IR and IGF-1R nor the insulin-induced increase in extracellular AII36 was affected (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that insulin-induced secretion of AII36 from IR- and IGF1R-overexpressed cells as well as PC12 cells. A time course study of insulin was performed to further investigate the insulin-induced AII secretion and the receptor/AII association. NIH-3T3IR and NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells were treated with 100 nminsulin for various lengths of time, and phosphorylation of IR and IGF-1R was examined on Western blots by an anti-phospho-IR/IGF-1R antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 A, insulin triggered a rapid phosphorylation of IR and IGF-1R at 3 min after treatment. The phosphorylation of IR remained at similarly high levels for as long as 60 min after treatment, whereas phosphorylation of IGF-1R showed a time-dependent increase that peaked at 30 min post-treatment and remained high at 60 min post-treatment. Whereas the amount of AII36 coprecipitated with IR and IGF-1R was markedly decreased at 3 min after insulin treatment, it returned to the control level 15 min after insulin treatment (Fig. 4 B). Secretion of AII36 from NIH-3T3IR and NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells was detected at all times examined after insulin stimulation, although it was slightly reduced from 30 min onward after insulin treatment (Fig. 4 C). Since AII is a major substrate of both pp60c-Src and protein kinase C, to investigate possible downstream involvement of these protein kinases in insulin-stimulated AII36 secretion, we applied, respectively PP1, a c-Src inhibitor, and BiSM-1, a cell-permeable protein kinase C inhibitor, to NIH-3T3IR and NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells 15 min prior to insulin treatment. PP1 inhibited insulin-induced phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2), indicating the effectiveness of the inhibitor (Fig. 5 A). BiSM-1 was also effective in abolishing phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in human fibroblasts (data not shown), a downstream event of bradykinin receptor activation (33Zhao W.Q. Ravindranath L. Mohamed A.S. Zohar O. Chen G.H. Lyketsos C.G. René Etcheberrigaray R. Alkon D.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 11: 166-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These two inhibitors, however, had no effects on insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR (Fig. 5 B) and IGF-1R (Fig. 5 C); nor did they affect the subsequent AII secretion (Fig. 5, D and E) and dissociation of AII from IR and IGF-1R (data not shown). Tyr phosphorylation of AII36 was assessed by immunoprecipitation of AII36 with an antibody that interacts with the C terminus of AII36. The in vivo Tyr phosphorylation of AII36 was then examined on Western blots with an anti-phospho-Tyr antibody. An apparent basal level of AII36Tyr phosphorylation was detected in all cells examined before insulin treatment, but this Tyr phosphorylation was significantly decreased (p < 0.001) after insulin stimulation (Fig. 5 F). PP1 showed effects on neither the basal AII36 phosphorylation nor the changes in AII36phosphorylation under insulin treatment (Fig. 5 G). These results suggest that the insulin-induced AII secretion may be a direct consequence of receptor activation that does not involve downstream kinases such as protein kinase C and c-Src.Figure 5A, effects of PP1 on insulin-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Cells were treated with or without 100 nm insulin for 3 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of different concentrations of PP1. The basal and the insulin-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation were measured by an anti-phospho-Erk1/2 antibody (P-Erk1/2). The extent of phosphorylation was assessed by calculation of the ratio of phospho-Erk1/2 over the total amount of Erk1/2 (R-Erk1/2). B, effects of PP1 on insulin-stimulated IR/IGF-1R phosphorylation. Cells were treated under the same conditions as described for A. The insulin-activated phosphorylations of IR and IGF-1R were measured by anti-phospho-IR/IGF-1R antibody (P-IR andP-IGF-1R). The total amount of IR and IGF-1R was determined by using the regular anti-IR or anti-IGF-1R antibodies (R-IRand R-IGF-1R). Ratios of phosphorylated receptors over the total amount of the receptors were calculated to determine the extent of receptor phosphorylation. C, effects of BiSM-1 on insulin-stimulated IR/IGF-1R phosphorylation. Cells were treated with or without insulin in the presence or absence of different concentrations of BiSM-1 (0.5–5.0 μm). The resulting receptor phosphorylation was examined and analyzed as described forB. D, effects of PP1 on insulin-stimulated AII36 secretion. Cells were treated as described forB, and the extracellular AII36 was measured as described in the legend to Fig. 3 A. E, effects of BiSM-1 on insulin-stimulated AII36 secretion. Cells were treated as described for C, and the extracellular AII36 was measured as described in the legend to Fig. 3 A. F, changes in AII36 tyrosine phosphorylation after insulin stimulation. AII36 from nonstimulated and insulin-stimulated NIH-3T3IR, NIH-3T3IGF-1R, and PC12 cells were precipitated by anti-AII antibody, and its Tyr phosphorylation was detected in immunoblot (ib) with an anti-phospho-Tyr antibody. G, changes in AII Tyr phosphorylation after insulin treatment in the presence of PP1 were measured as described for F. The values of Tyr phosphorylation signals from each condition were normalized with the total amount of AII36 detected on Western blot with anti-AII antibody. In all panels, bar graphs summarize results from three or four experimental replicates (means ± S.E.; **, p < 0.001;t test and one-way analysis of variance).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 6 shows the immunocytochemistry results, in which cells were double stained with either IR or IGF-1R (green) and AII36 (red) antibodies.Images in Fig. 6 A show double staining of IGF-1R and AII36 in NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells, whereasimages in Fig. 6 B show double staining of IR and AII36 in PC12 cells. Under nonstimulated conditions, AII36 was homogeneously distributed in the cytosolic compartment. Prominent colocalization of AII36 with both IR and IGF-1R was seen in both cells indicated by the yellow color (Fig. 6, A-1 and B-1). Upon insulin stimulation, a reduction of intracellular AII36levels was seen in both NIH-3T3IGF-1R and PC12 cells alone with decreased colocalization of AII36 with IGF-1R and IR (Fig. 6, A-2 and B-2). In addition, an insulin-induced increase in the amount of AII36 was detected in the extracellular space. The extracellular AII36 appeared to attach to the outside surface of the membrane, particularly in the NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells (Fig. 6 B-2, pointed arrow). Fig. 6 B-3 shows the enlarged area of the square in Fig. 6 B-2. Similar results were also observed in NIH-3T3IR cells (data not shown). Western blotting showed consistent findings that insulin stimulation induced a reduction in intracellular AII36 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 C). Although it has long been known that AII36 can be secreted into the extracellular compartment, the molecular mechanisms underlying secretion of AII36 are unknown. Our results show that insulin stimulation markedly increased the amount of extracellular AII36, suggesting a link between IR/IGF-1R signaling and AII36 secretion. AII36 is known as one of the major substrates of c-Src protein-tyrosine kinase (3Gould K.L. Woodgett J.R. Isacke C.M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and is also involved in signaling events downstream from IR (27Mai J. Waisman D.M. Sloane B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Under nonstimulated conditions, AII36 was associated with IR and IGF-1R as indicated by coimmunoprecipitation of AII36 with IR and IGF-1R from NIH-3T3IR, NIH-3T3IGF-1R, and PC12 cells. Stimulation of cells with insulin markedly reduced association of AII36 with these protein-tyrosine kinases along with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of AII36. In the PC-12 cells, although IGF-1R was shown to be 4 times as abundant as the IR, a similar amount of AII was coprecipitated by both IR and IGF-1R antibody (Fig. 1, D-1). This may be due to the possibility that only a proportion of the receptors were associated with AII36 among the precipitated IGF-1R receptors from PC12 cells. Such factors as differences in binding affinity to AII between IR and IGF-1R in PC12 cells may also account for the observed results. The insulin-stimulated dissociation of AII36 from IR or IGF-1R was shown to be a rapid but temporary event, since the amount of AII36 “pulled down” with the receptors returned to the control level 15 min after insulin stimulation, although phosphorylation of IR and IGF-1R lasted as long as 60 min after insulin stimulation. It should be noted that, in addition to the mature IGF-1R β-subunit, AII36 was also associated with the IGF-1R precursor protein (Fig. 1 B-3), which is a single polypeptide that contains α- and β-subunits of the receptor with a relative molecular mass of 180 kDa. IGF-1R precursor has been known to exhibit both ligand-binding ability and tyrosine kinase activity (34Jacobs S. Kull F.C., Jr. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1228-12231Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 35Duronio V. Jacobs S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5436-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insulin-stimulated IGF-1R precursor phosphorylation was also observed in the present study (Fig. 3 C-2). Like the mature receptors, however, the physiological significance of the AII/IGF-1R precursor interaction remains to be determined. Interestingly, the dissociations of AII36 from IR and IGF-1R were correlated with the insulin-stimulated increases in extracellular AII36 and a reduction in intracellular AII36. The extracellular AII36 detected in the culture medium was not due to the contamination of intracellular AII36, since all culture media had been carefully centrifuged to remove any suspending cells before concentration. Furthermore, extracellular AII36 was not seen in the nontransfected NIH-3T3 cells, which expressed the same amount of AII as NIH-3T3IR and NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells. The increases in the extracellular AII36 were insulin dose-dependent (particularly in NIH-3T3IRcells) and were closely correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of IR and IGF-1R, an indication of the receptors' activation. The fact that a similar amount of AII was detected in the extracellular compartment of NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells after 1 and 100 nm insulin treatment might suggest that secretion of AII36 saturates at the activation level of IGF-1R in response to 1 nm of insulin. Alternatively, as shown by the immunocytochemistry results, a part of AII36 secreted from NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells under 100 nm insulin stimulation binds to the outer layer of the plasma membrane, which may have offset the amount of unbound AII36 detected in the culture medium. Inhibition of IR and IGF-1R kinase activities by AG1024 significantly reduced the insulin-stimulated extracellular AII36. The fact that a more obvious reduction of extracellular AII36 was seen with IR inhibition compared with the IGF-1R inhibition suggests that transport of AII to the extracellular compartment may be more closely associated with activity of IR. Furthermore, activation of other growth factor receptors such as the PDGF receptor resulted in no extracellular AII36. All of these results indicate that production of the extracellular AII36 is closely correlated with activities of IR and IGF-1R. Since extracellular AII36 was detectable at all of the post-insulin treatment times and since the insulin-stimulated receptor phosphorylation was also persistent, it is not clear whether the detected AII36 after the longer term insulin stimulation was due to continuous secretion or was from a one-time secretion at an early stage of the stimulation. Given the fact that association of AII with IR and IGF-1R returned to control levels 15 min after insulin treatment, it is possible that AII36 is secreted shortly after activation of IR or IGF-1R and stays in the extracellular matrix until it is degraded by extracellular proteolysis. The reduction of extracellular AII36 at 30 and 60 min after insulin treatment may reflect such degradation. In rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing the human insulin receptor, insulin has been reported to induce rapid cytoskeletal protein rearrangement and membrane ruffling that requires activity of PI 3-kinase (36Martin S.S. Rose D.W. Saltiel A.R. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5045-5054Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). One could argue that the increased extracellular AII36 after insulin stimulation might be a nonspecific result of an insulin-induced loss of actin stress fibers and membrane ruffling in the IR- or IGF-1R-overexpressed cells. To test this possibility, we treated cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, which has been shown to prevent insulin-induced stress fiber breakdown (36Martin S.S. Rose D.W. Saltiel A.R. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5045-5054Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with wortmannin did not reduce the insulin-stimulated increase in extracellular AII36 but completely abolished the insulin-induced activation of Akt (Fig. 2 D), another insulin-dependent molecular event downstream of PI 3-kinase (13Brozinick J.T., Jr. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14679-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 37Nystrom F.H. Quon M.J. Cell. Signalling. 1999; 11: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These results suggest, therefore, that the insulin-induced extracellular AII36 is not due to cell membrane damage but rather a receptor activity-driven secretion process. Although AII36 is known to be a major substrate for protein kinase C and pp60c-Src tyrosine kinase, inhibition of these two kinases did not affect the insulin-stimulated AII secretion and changes in its receptor interaction. It is possible, therefore, that in response to insulin stimulation, IR and IGF-1R directly regulate AII36tyrosine phosphorylation through changes in their interaction with AII36. Thus, secretion of AII36 might be an immediate cellular event coupled to IR and IGF-1R activation. The increased extracellular AII36 after insulin stimulation was not only detected in the culture medium, which should contain the soluble form of AII36, but also was seen on the outside layer of the plasma membrane, particularly in the NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells (Fig. 6 A). Given that 1) IR and IGF-1R were shown to be associated with AII36 but not with other annexins such as annexin VI; 2) no extracellular annexin VI was detected under both nonstimulated and insulin-stimulated conditions; and 3) the increase in extracellular AII36closely coincided with the reduction of the intracellular AII and the IR/AII36 and IGF-1R/AII36 shortly after insulin stimulation, it is tempting to speculate that IR and/or IGF-1R binds to AII36 and thereby anchors AII to the vicinity of the plasma membrane. Activation of IR or IGF1-R may regulate the secretion process of AII36 that requires dissociation of the bound AII36 from the receptors and Tyr dephosphorylation of AII. However, further research will be required to understand this process and the molecular mechanisms that underlie secretion of AII and to verify the role of IR and/or IGF-1R in secretion of AII. Extracellular AII has been associated with cell adhesion and migration in both normal and malignant tumor cells through its interactions with extra matrix proteases and structural proteins. The present results may shed light on the potential role(s) of the insulin and the insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways in protein secretion, cell adhesion, and migration of both normal and malignant cells. Furthermore, given its roles in these extracellular events, AII may provide a potential therapeutic target for extracellular matrix-associated pathological processes such as tumor metastasis."

Rpb4, a nonessential subunit of the core RNA polymerase II has been proposed to play a role in non-stress-specific transcription and in the regulation of stress response in yeast. We find that in addition to the temperature sensitivity of the null mutant of Rpb4, diploid null mutants are also compromised in sporulation and show morphological changes associated with nitrogen starvation. Using whole genome expression analysis, we report here the effects of Rpb4 on expression of genes during normal growth and following heat shock and nutritional starvation. Our analysis shows that Rpb4 affects expression of a small yet significant fraction of the genome in both stress and normal conditions. We found that genes involved in galactose metabolism were dependent on the presence of Rpb4 irrespective of the environmental condition. Rpb4 was also found to affect the expression of several other genes specifically in conditions of nutritional starvation. The general defect in the absence of Rpb4 is in the expression of metabolic genes, especially those involved in carbon metabolism and energy generation. We report that various stresses are affected byRPB4 and that on overexpression the stress-specific activators can partially rescue the corresponding defects.

The survival of a cell depends on its ability to respond rapidly to environmental changes. This involves sensing small changes in multiple parameters, integrating the signals together, and rapidly changing the expression profile. Temperature and nutrient levels are prone to frequent fluctuations in the environment and elicit rapid and transient genome-wide changes. Although transcriptional changes during stress response have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about the contribution of core RNA polymerase II in bringing about these changes in the transcriptional program of the cell.The yeast RNA polymerase II is composed of 12 subunits, Rpb1–Rpb12. Rpb1, Rpb2, and Rpb3/Rpb11 are homologs of the bacterial core RNA polymerase subunits. Rpb5, Rpb6, Rpb8, Rpb10, and Rpb12 are shared between the three RNA polymerases, I, II, and III (1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Google Scholar). Rpb5 has been shown to have a role in transcriptional activation (2Miyao T. Woychik N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15281-15286Google Scholar). Rpb4 and Rpb9 are nonessential for normal growth, but their deletion results in temperature sensitivity (3Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Google Scholar, 4Woychik N.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Google Scholar). Rpb4 interacts with Rpb7, a smaller essential subunit, to form a subcomplex, which dissociates from the polymerase on mild denaturation (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of Rpb4 within the polymerase increases during the stationary phase (6Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Google Scholar).Another interesting feature of the Rpb4 subunit is that in its absence cells exhibit a wide variety of phenotypes associated with stress conditions. An rpb4Δ mutant is unable to survive at extreme temperatures (>34 °C and <12 °C) and dies rapidly during a prolonged stationary phase (3Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Google Scholar, 6Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Google Scholar). Recently, several groups have shown that Rpb4 plays an important role in the activation of many genes (7Tan Q.Li, X. Sadhale P.P. Miyao T. Woychik N.A Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8124-8133Google Scholar, 8Pillai B. Sampath V. Sharma N. Sadhale P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30641-30647Google Scholar) but has a milder effect on the basal expression of these genes. Expression analysis of specific genes showed that RNA polymerase II from the mutant lacking Rpb4 cannot transcribe some genes (9Rosenheck S. Choder M. J Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6187-6192Google Scholar). Whole genome expression profiles and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins have shown that in the absence of Rpb4, the polymerase is inactivated at high temperature (37 °C for 45 min to 1 h) (10Miyao T. Barnett J.D. Woychik N.A J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46408-46413Google Scholar,11Maillet I. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22586-22590Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported the initial observations from whole genome expression analysis of rpb4Δ mutant before and after heat shock (12Pillai B. Brahmachari S.K. Sadhale P.P. Curr. Sci. 2001; 81: 574-578Google Scholar).We report here that the stress-associated effects of Rpb4 extend beyond temperature sensitivity. Heat shock, a short and transient exposure to high temperature, reveals a transcriptional pattern inrpb4Δ that is strikingly different from that of wild type cells. We have studied whole genome expression profiles of haploid and diploid yeast cells, under conditions of normal growth and starvation. Comparison of expression profiles of rpb4Δ and wild type cells show that in the absence of Rpb4, some genes involved in specific pathways of stress response are down-regulated in the corresponding condition. In general, in the absence of Rpb4, the transcription of many genes involved in key physiological pathways like glycolysis and energy generation is affected. Nevertheless, Rpb4 is not an essential gene. Therefore, the aberrant stress response defects shown by yeast cells in the absence of RPB4 may be a consequence of an underlying defect in fine tuning the expression of metabolic genes.RESULTSRpb4 a nonessential subunit of the RNA polymerase II, is required for the survival of yeast cells at extreme temperatures above 34 °C and below 12 °C (3Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Google Scholar). At room temperature, the rpb4Δmutant grows slowly and loses viability rapidly in stationary phase (3Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Google Scholar,6Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Google Scholar). We constructed homozygous null mutants at the RPB4 locus to study the effect of Rpb4 on other stress responses. We found that the rpb4Δ/rpb4Δ strain was unable to sporulate efficiently compared with arpb4Δ/rpb4Δ strain carrying a plasmid expressing RPB4 under the control of its own promoter (Fig. 1 A). Overexpression ofRPB4 resulted in a further increase in sporulation levels (Fig. 1 B). We also observed that under nitrogen starvation conditions, rpb4Δ/rpb4Δ cells were more elongated than the wild type and bud in a unipolar budding pattern. This pattern resembles pseudohyphae formation. Expression ofRPB4 restored the normal cell shape and budding pattern (Fig. 1 C).Previous studies on the various aspects of transcription inrpb4Δ cells have led to the suggestion that RNA polymerase II is unable to function effectively at high temperatures in the absence of Rpb4 (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Google Scholar, 9Rosenheck S. Choder M. J Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6187-6192Google Scholar, 10Miyao T. Barnett J.D. Woychik N.A J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46408-46413Google Scholar, 11Maillet I. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22586-22590Google Scholar). To understand the effect of Rpb4 on transcription during normal and stress conditions, we determined whole genome expression patterns using microarray analyses under different stresses. The various strains and conditions used in each experiment are summarized in Table I. RNA was isolated from the null mutant of RPB4 carrying either a vector or a centromeric plasmid bearing RPB4 gene (under the control of its own promoter) grown under identical conditions. The data points which showed consistent results in duplicate spots and reciprocal experiments were used for further analyses. We normalized the intensity of the signal from each spot to the total intensity in each channel. Following normalization, the intensity of the spots corresponding to ACT1 gene (actin) in both channels was comparable. The genes, which showed more than 2-fold differences consistently in each condition, were compiled. All further analysis was done using this data set. The total number of genes up-regulated and down-regulated in the mutant as compared with the wild type are tabulated (Table II). Under normal growth conditions Rpb4 affects the expression of 120 and 121 genes, respectively in haploid and diploid yeast cells. The effect of Rpb4 is on a similar scale in other conditions of stress such as sporulation and nitrogen starvation. In all conditions, except heat shock, the genes affected by Rpb4 amounted to nearly 1.7% of the genome. Following a short duration of heat shock, the effect of Rpb4 is more pronounced, extending to 9.2% of the genome (589 genes: 237 up-regulated and 352 down-regulated).Table ISummary of strain backgrounds and conditions in each experimentExperimentStrains comparedConditionsGrowth mediumTemperatureTimePloidy°C1rpb4Δ + vectorYPD2512 hnrpb4Δ+ RPB42rpb4Δ + vectorYPD3930 minnrpb4Δ + RPB43rpb4Δ/rpb4Δ + vectorYPD2512 h2nrpb4Δ/rpb4Δ + RPB44rpb4Δ/rpb4Δ + vectorSLAD2512 h2nrpb4Δ/rpb4Δ + RPB45rpb4Δ/rpb4Δ + vector1% potassium acetate2512 h2nrpb4Δ/rpb4Δ + RPB4In experiments 2, 4, and 5 the cultures were pregrown in YEPD for 12 h at 25 °C before being subjected to the stress Open table in a new tab Table IISummary of genes affected in rpb4Δ mutant in all experimentsExperimentPloidy/conditionNumber of genesUp-regulatedDown-regulatedTotal% of genome1Haploid, nonstress37831201.8752Haploid, stress (temperature)2373525899.203Diploid, nonstress46751211.894Diploid, stress (low nitrogen)111081191.855Diploid, stress (sporulation)1267791.23 Open table in a new tab We examined the effect of Rpb4 in various stress and nonstress conditions by comparing the overlap between the down-regulated genes in various conditions. The Venn diagrams in Fig. 2 show that the extent of overlap in the affected genes is minimal between stress and nonstress conditions. Overall, the transcriptional effects of RPB4 seem to be specific for the environmental condition because there are very few genes that are dependent on Rpb4 under all conditions. The overlap between the expression profiles under various stress conditions is marginally higher than that between nonstress and stress conditions.Figure 2Effect of Rpb4 on genome-wide transcription profile under various stress conditions. The labeled cDNAs from wild type and the rpb4Δ haploid strain grown at room temperature or 39 °C for 30 min were used to probe S. cerevisiae whole genome microarrays. The Venn diagrams in theleft and middle panels represent the overlap of number of genes down-regulated or up-regulated (at least 2-fold) inrpb4Δ strain under these conditions. The diploid homozygous rpb4Δ/rpb4Δ strain and the corresponding wild type strains were used to isolate RNA and detect differential expression of genes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Venn diagram in the right panel shows the overlap of genes down-regulated in diploidrpb4Δ/rpb4Δ strain in either rich medium, sporulation medium, or SLAD medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We classified the known genes according to their functional roles as annotated in the Munich Information Centre for Protein Sequences data base (Table III). In all experiments, a substantial number of the affected genes were of unknown functions, and the largest number of genes affected by the absence of Rpb4 were involved in metabolism and energy generation. Hence, the general defect associated with rpb4Δ seems to be its inability to express metabolic genes properly. in addition to this defect in the expression of basic physiological pathways, specific defects associated with each condition studied are summarized below.Table IIIFunctional classification of affected genesExperimentMetabolismEnergyCell growth/ divisionTranscriptionProtein synthesisProtein destinationTransport facilitationCellular transportCellular biogenesisCellular communicationCell rescue/ deathIonic homeostasisTotalHaploid/RTUp40542432212029Down2714342511106064Haploid/HSUp426182011113687490244Down103522928822192188268332Diploid/richUp82760354016042Down2515632244316273Diploid/pseudohyphaeUp10410221103116Down4223912083834182132Diploid/spor.Up40230101002013Down297117161012106393Genome10652528367933595893114982061353691255538The classes with a substantially high number of genes are underlined. The total number of genes in each condition does not add up to the known genes detected because some genes that function in more than one class have been assigned to multiple groups. RT, room temperature; HS, heat shock; Spor, sporulation. Open table in a new tab Heat Shock-specific DefectsRpb4 has a pronounced effect on gene expression following heat shock. In comparison with other stress and nonstress conditions, a larger number of genes are affected following heat shock. Functional classification of these genes revealed that they are involved in basic metabolic pathways. A striking feature of the transcriptional profile was that rpb4Δ cells after heat shock showed higher levels of transcripts of genes involved in protein synthesis. These include genes, which code for 97 ribosomal proteins (of 132), proteins of the cap-binding complex, translation initiation factors, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, components of the ribosome associated complex, and proteins involved in processing and transport of rRNA. It is well known that yeast cells transiently repress genes involved in protein synthesis following heat shock (20Warner J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 437-440Google Scholar). The increase in expression of these genes is probably a reflection of a defect in this repression.Sporulation-specific DefectsWild type andrpb4Δ/rpb4Δ strains were grown in rich medium at permissive conditions until mid-log phase. The cells were then transferred to sporulation medium. Following 12 h of incubation in sporulation medium, 67 genes showed a more than 2-fold decrease in expression in rpb4Δ/rpb4Δ cells when compared with wild type cells under identical conditions. Interestingly, 22 of these 67 genes (33%) are on the right arm of the second chromosome. A majority of these genes are involved in carbon metabolism, as is the case in other conditions. RIM4, a regulatory gene, andSPS1, SPS2, SPS4, andSPS100 are down-regulated inrpb4Δ/rpb4Δ. The SPS genes are involved in spore wall synthesis and are usually induced during the late stages of sporulation (21Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Google Scholar). They require the master regulator of meiosis, Ime1, for their expression. This agrees well with our earlier observations, using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, electron microscopic analyses, and Northern analyses, thatrpb4Δ/rpb4Δ cells are arrested in the early steps of meiosis and are unable to express early meiotic genes (data not shown). None of the 12 genes up-regulated under this condition is known to play any role in sporulation.Defects Associated with Nitrogen Starvation ConditionsDespite the difference in morphology ofrpb4Δ/rpb4Δ cells, we did not detect any general induction of genes known to be involved in pseudohyphae formation in these strains following nitrogen starvation.IRA1, BEM1, AXL1, and ADH1are the only genes differentially expressed in rpb4Δ known to be important in pseudohyphae formation (22Palecek S.P. Parikh A.S. Kron S.J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1005-1023Google Scholar).We clustered genes according to the ratio of their expression in mutantrpb4Δ (or rpb4Δ/rpb4Δ) to wild type in the five conditions tested (room temperature, heat shock, rich medium, sporulation condition, and pseudohyphal growth condition) as listed in Table I. Details of some interesting clusters are shown in Fig. 3. A more extensive table with the ratios of expression values of all of the differentially expressed genes is available as supplementary data (Table SI).Figure 3Clustering analysis shows classes of genes, which show Rpb4-dependent effects in normal and stress conditions. A, ribosomal proteins and other proteins of the translation machinery are expressed in rpb4Δ at higher levels than in the wild type strain following heat shock. B, the cluster of genes showing dependence on Rpb4 irrespective of the environmental condition include the group of genes at the Gal1–Gal10 locus (GAL1, GAL10, GAL7, and KAP104). Only some of the genes in this cluster have been mentioned in the figure. C, genes in this cluster were specifically down-regulated in sporulation conditions. These genes are known to be induced during late stages of sporulation and play a role in spore wall maturation. In rpb4Δ/rpb4Δthese genes are down-regulated in keeping with its inability to sporulate. RT, room temperature; HS, heat shock;RI, rich medium; PS, pseudohyphae-inducing medium; SP, sporulation medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Many genes that code for hexose transporters of the major facilitator class were found to be down-regulated in the mutant lacking Rpb4. We therefore checked the rate of glucose uptake in these strains. We found that in agreement with the expression profile, haploid and diploidRPB4 deletion mutants consumed glucose slowly compared with the wild type. At mid-log phase, haploid and diploid wild type cells had exhausted 68 and 61% of the glucose provided in the medium, respectively. But in RPB4 deletion mutants these numbers dropped to 3 and 24%, respectively (Fig. 4). The homozygous diploid mutant compared with the haploid strain lacking Rpb4 seems to be less defective at high temperature and in glucose uptake, although the reasons for this difference are not clear. In normal and stress conditions rpb4Δ showed a distinctly different transcriptional profile compared with that of wild type cells. We compared protein profiles of the rpb4Δ cells to wild type under conditions in which we had found transcriptional differences. We found that there were gross changes in protein profiles reflecting the differences in transcription profiles (results not shown). Even under normal conditions of growth there are substantial differences in the levels of many proteins in rpb4Δ. Thus, the absence of Rpb4 resulted in altered transcriptional and protein profiles in normal and different stress conditions.Figure 4The microarray results are corroborated by biochemical phenotypes. Glucose uptake is affected inrpb4Δ strain. The graph represents the percentage of glucose left in the supernatant medium during growth of the wild type (dotted lines) and the rpb4Δ mutant (solid lines). The haploid (▪) and diploid (▴) lines are marked. The growth phases: lag, early log (E-log), mid-log (M-log), and stationary (S) phases are indicated at the top of the graph.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Studies of Activator Overexpression in Rescue of Stress Response PhenotypesFrom previously reported studies and our results reported here, rpb4Δ mutants show: 1) defects in survival under extreme temperatures, 2) defects in sporulation, and 3) pseudohyphae-like morphology. We have previously reported that the activation defect of rpb4Δ strain can be partially rescued by overexpression of the cognate transcriptional activator (8Pillai B. Sampath V. Sharma N. Sadhale P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30641-30647Google Scholar). Msn2 (transcriptional activator in heat shock response) and some other proteins (that are not transcriptional activators) have been shown to partially rescue the temperature sensitivity of rpb4Δcells (7Tan Q.Li, X. Sadhale P.P. Miyao T. Woychik N.A Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8124-8133Google Scholar). Because our focus in this manuscript is on other stress responses, we report here the effect of overexpression of specific transcriptional activators under each condition. We observed that inrpb4Δ cells the transcriptional activator IME4, of early meiosis gene IME1 (23Shah J.C. Clancy M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1078-1086Google Scholar), was not induced at all compared with the wild type cells, which showed a strong peak of induction at 0.5 h in sporulation medium (Fig. 5 A). We used the inducible promoter PCUP1 to overexpress IME4 at different times during pre growth in the rich medium and after transfer of cells in the sporulation medium. We observed that the sporulation defect was partially rescued when IME4 was overexpressed after transfer to sporulation medium (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5The overexpression of transcriptional activators rescues stress responses. A, the Ime4 transcriptional activator is not induced in sporulation conditions in absence of RPB4. The Northern blot of RNA isolated fromrpb4 and RPB4 cells incubated in sporulation medium was probed with IME4 gene. The lower panel shows the same blot probed with 18 S RNA probe as control for equal loading of RNA. The numbers below the panels indicate the numbers of hours of incubation in sporulation medium. B, the transcriptional activator IME4 on overexpression rescues the sporulation defect. The bar graph shows percentage sporulation after 4 days in the three strains tested. The results of induction at half an hour post-transfer into the sporulation medium are shown. C, overexpression of transcriptional activatorPHD1 enhances pseudohyphal morphology. The top panel shows the cells containing the vector, whereas thelower panel shows the cells carrying the above vector withPHD1 open reading frame under GAL1 promoter. The photos were taken after 3 days of incubation on SLAGR medium (SLAGR medium contains 2% galactose and 1% raffinose instead of dextrose in the SLAD medium).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)There are many candidate transcriptional activators regulating pseudohyphae formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We chose Phd1, a transcriptional activator that exaggerates pseudohyphae formation in strains predisposed to forming pseudohyphae (24Gimeno C.J. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2100-2112Google Scholar). We overexpressed the Phd1 protein in theshr3-102/shr3-102 background (CGX19) as well as in rpb4Δ and the corresponding wild type strain. The overexpression in the CGX19 strain served as a control for overexpression of Phd1 because the CGX19 strain is also predisposed to pseudohyphae formation and shows an exaggerated pseudohyphal response (24Gimeno C.J. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2100-2112Google Scholar). Overexpression of Phd1 resulted in exaggeration of pseudohyphae formation in rpb4Δ mutants as compared with wild type (Fig. 5 C).DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have conclusively shown that Rpb4 can affect the transcription of many promoters in vitro (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Google Scholar, 7Tan Q.Li, X. Sadhale P.P. Miyao T. Woychik N.A Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8124-8133Google Scholar, 9Rosenheck S. Choder M. J Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6187-6192Google Scholar). Studies using promoter reporter constructs have also shown that various unrelated genes are affected to different extents in rpb4Δ(8Pillai B. Sampath V. Sharma N. Sadhale P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30641-30647Google Scholar). On the other hand, the stress-related phenotypes ofrpb4Δ cells like temperature sensitivity and lethality during the stationary phase point toward a stress-specific role forRPB4 in transcription. It was proposed that in the absence of Rpb4, the polymerase is unstable at 37 °C or above (1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Google Scholar, 7Tan Q.Li, X. Sadhale P.P. Miyao T. Woychik N.A Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8124-8133Google Scholar, 9Rosenheck S. Choder M. J Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6187-6192Google Scholar, 10Miyao T. Barnett J.D. Woychik N.A J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46408-46413Google Scholar). Instability of the polymerase lacking Rpb4 following exposure to high temperature is conceivable, but a similar mechanism may not fully explain the role of Rpb4 in other stresses. In addition to the known roles in survival at high temperature and stationary phase, we found that rpb4Δ/rpb4Δ cells were also defective in sporulation, a response to extreme starvation, and showed altered morphology associated with pseudohyphae formation.We observed that Rpb4 affects (up-regulated and down-regulated) 1.9% of the total number of genes whose expression pattern was detected under normal conditions. Consistent with our previous report using promoter-reporter fusions, we see that the endogenous expression ofGAL1 and INO1 genes is compromised inrpb4Δ cells (12Pillai B. Brahmachari S.K. Sadhale P.P. Curr. Sci. 2001; 81: 574-578Google Scholar). Interestingly, following a short exposure to nonpermissive temperature, 9.2% of the total genes detected show changes dependent on Rpb4. Only 9.5% of the genes dependent on Rpb4 after heat shock are similarly affected during normal growth. This implies that the role of Rpb4 in transcription immediately following heat shock is significantly different and more drastic from that in other stress conditions. It has a less conspicuous and probably different role during normal conditions of growth. Gasch et al. (25Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Google Scholar) and Causton et al. (26Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E. Jennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 323-337Google Scholar) have recently reported the genome-wide expression pattern during heat shock in yeast cells. Both reports show that genes involved in carbon metabolism, mitochondrial function, and glucose transport are up-regulated after heat shock, and genes involved in protein synthesis are down-regulated. In response to heat shock, rpb4Δ cells have lower transcript levels of genes involved in carbon metabolism and mitochondrial function and higher transcript levels of genes of ribosomal proteins as compared with wild type. It appears thatrpb4Δ cells are incapable of adopting the normal transcriptional response to heat shock. Recently, genome-wide expression analyses done after exposing rpb4Δ cells to high temperatures for a relatively longer time than reported here has confirmed that most of the transcription in the cell is eventually shut down in rpb4Δ cells (10Miyao T. Barnett J.D. Woychik N.A J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46408-46413Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that immediately following temperature stress, rpb4Δ cells do not adopt a normal heat shock-associated transcriptional response (repression of ribosomal proteins and up-regulation of mitochondrial genes, hexose transporters, and galactose metabolism genes). With prolonged incubation at high temperature, the polymerase lacking Rpb4 becomes incapable of transcribing 98% of the genome, the reach of this inactive polymerase being as wide as that of rpb1-1, a conditional mutant of the largest subunit of the polymerase (10Miyao T. Barnett J.D. Woychik N.A J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46408-46413Google Scholar).The genes up-regulated and down-regulated after heat shock were grouped based on the factors (proteins, environmental factors, other inducers of gene expression) to which they are known to respond. These transcriptional regulators are probably either functionally correlated to Rpb4 or dependent on Rpb4 for their function. The maximum number of genes down-regulated in rpb4Δ after heat shock are known to be under the control of Msn2, the transcriptional activator of stress response element (STRE)-regulated genes (27Moskvina E. Imre E.M. Ruis H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1263-1272Google Scholar). This agrees with the observation reported earlier that Msn2 overexpression can partially complement the temperature sensitivity of rpb4Δcells (7Tan Q.Li, X. Sadhale P.P. Miyao T. Woych"

J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2001; 33: 599-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and channelopathies (3Lehmann-Horn F. Jurkat-Rott K. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1317-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 4Ptáček L.J. Bendahhou S. Disorders of Voluntary Muscle. 7th Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2001: 604-634Google Scholar) due to inherited mutations, including hyperkaleimic periodic paralysis, myotonia congenita, and Long QT syndrome. Although their functions have been extensively characterized via electrophysiology (5Keynes R.D. Novartis Found. Symp. 2001; 241: 5-14Google Scholar), structural studies remain scanty, and the molecular basis of the central process of gating is still elusive despite recent progress (6Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Sodium channels show strong sequence conservation across species and tissue-specific types (7Goldin A.L. Barchi R.L. Caldwell J.H. Hofmann F. Howe J.R. Hunter J.C. Kallen R.G. Mandel G. Meisler M.H. Netter Y.B. Noda M. Tamkun M.M. Waxman S.G. Wood J.N. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 28: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The sodium channel from the electric eel electroplax is 60% identical with that of voltage-gated sodium channels from human muscle. The patterns of hydrophobicity and homologous residues are even more closely preserved, and this indicates that their three-dimensional structures will be very similar. The primary structure of the sodium channel from Electrophorus electricus was deduced from its cDNA sequence (8Noda M. Shimizu S. Tanabe T. Takai T. Kayano T. Ikeda T. Takahashi H. Nakayama H. Kanaoka Y. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Raftery M.A. Hirose T. Inayama S. Hayashida H. Miyata T. Numa S. Nature. 1984; 312: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) and revealed the protein to consist of 1820 amino acids, producing a molecular mass of 208 kDa. There are also extensive sugar moieties covalently linked to the protein on its external face, making the total molecular mass of the channel ∼260–270 kDa (9Levinson S.R. Thornhill W.B. Duch D.S. Recio-Pinto E. Urban B.W. Narahashi T. Ion Channels. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 33-64Google Scholar). Its sequence contains four highly homologous internal repeats (domains I–IV), each of which consists of six transmembrane–spanning segments (S1–S6), plus linking regions of differing lengths between the domains and extended aqueous-soluble N- and C-terminal domains. The intracellular linker between domains III and IV has been identified by mutation studies (10Patton D.E. West J.W. Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1992; 89: 10905-10909Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) as being involved in fast inactivation, and an NMR study of this peptide in isolation (11Kuroda Y. Maeda Y. Miyamoto K. Tanaka K. Kanaori K. Otaka A. Fujii N. Nakagawa T. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1363-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that it has the potential for folding as an α-helix. The C-terminal intracellular domain has also been associated with a form of inactivation and a postulated interaction with the N-terminal segment; its secondary structure has been analyzed by circular dichroism (CD)1 spectroscopy (12Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.-S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Zhang H. Kolibal S. Vanderkooi J.M. Cohen S.A. Kallen R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The S4 transmembrane segments from domains I–IV have been identified as the main voltage sensors (14Stuhmer W. Conti F. Suzuki H. Wang X.D. Noda M. Yahagi N. Kubo H. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), whereas the S5–S6 segments and the intervening P-loop regions from domains I–V include residues comprising the transmembrane pore-associated helices and the ion selectivity filter (15Heinemann S.H. Schlief T. Mori Y. Imoto K. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1994; 27: 2781-2802PubMed Google Scholar). The low resolution (19 Å) three-dimensional structure of the sodium channel from E. electricus determined by cryoelectron microscopy and single particle image analysis (16Sato C. Ueno Y. Asai K. Takahashi K. Sato M. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2001; 409: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) revealed an overall architecture of four domains with pseudo-4-fold symmetry surrounding a central pore. The molecule is bell-shaped with an extracellular domain and transmembrane domain together comprising ∼50% of the total volume and a large intracellular domain occupying the remaining volume. The sodium channel can adopt distinct but correlated functional conformational states during resting, activation, inactivation, and deactivation. A conformational change upon voltage activation allosterically modifies the conformation of the transmembrane pore, which is spatially separate from the voltage sensors (17Patten C.D. Caprini M. Planells-Cases R. Montal M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The sodium channel acts as a capacitor in that there is a time lag between stimulation and opening of sodium gates. The stimulus charges the channel over a period of time leading to a conformational change or sequence of conformational changes of the sodium channel protein, which effectively opens the gate initiating an ionic current. Neurotoxins and drugs such as local anesthetics, anticonvulsants, and antiarrhythmics that modify sodium channel function have been shown to bind preferentially to specific conformational states affecting either activation, inactivation, or both (for a review, see Ref. 18Anger T. Madge D.J. Mulla M. Riddall D. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The antiepileptic drug lamotrigine (LTG) binds preferentially to open sodium channels during inactivation with apparent pore block (19Yarov-Yarovoy V. Brown J. Sharp E.M. Clare J.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Batrachotoxin (BTX) binds preferentially to the open state causing steady-state activation (20Narahashi T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 479: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), prevents all forms of inactivation, and slows deactivation. LTG and BTX bind to specific sites that have been shown by mutagenesis to have overlapping but distinct molecular determinants in the S6 transmembrane segments of domains I, III, and IV (19Yarov-Yarovoy V. Brown J. Sharp E.M. Clare J.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Ligand binding appears to be facilitated by gating movements of the pore segments allowing access to their binding sites (21Vedantham V. Cannon S.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2943-2958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To investigate the structural nature of the different functional states of the sodium channel, we have used LTG and BTX to shift the equilibrium mixture of states normally present in the absence of ligands to one of the specific functionally defined conformational states. CD spectroscopy was used to examine conformational changes associated with binding of these ligands to the sodium channel purified from E. electricus. These studies have shown that when either lamotrigine or batrachotoxin binds there is a significant change in secondary structure. Genapol C-100 (10% solution) was obtained from Calbiochem. IgM anti-α-2,8 N-acetylneuraminic acid was extracted from horse antiserum, a gift from Dr. R. Schneerson of the NICHD (22Allen P.Z. Glode M. Schneerson R. Robbins J.B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1982; 15: 324-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lamotrigine was a gift from Dr. R. W. Janes, Queen Mary College, University of London. Batrachotoxin was a gift from Dr. J. W. Daly of the NIDDK. Polyacrylhydrazido-agarose, lipids, protease inhibitors, and rabbit anti-horse IgG were purchased from Sigma. CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B Fast Flow and PHAST gels were from AmershamBiosciences and polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were from BDH Laboratory Supplies. Membranes were purified from frozen electroplax tissue in a manner similar to that previously described (23Miller J.A. Agnew W.S. Levinson S.R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24James W.M. Emerick M.C. Agnew W.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6001-6009Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) but with a number of modifications designed to increase the yield and maintain protein integrity: thawed diced tissue was suspended in 5 volumes of buffer A (200 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.025% pepstatin, 0.025% leupeptin, 0.025% aprotinin, 0.02% NaN3) and homogenized at 20,000 rpm for 1 min. After filtration, the sample was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer A, and the homogenization, filtration, and centrifugation steps were repeated. The pellets were resuspended in the buffer at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. Membrane yield was ∼20% of original electroplax tissue weight. Solubilization of proteins from electroplax membranes was achieved by addition of Genapol C-100 to the membrane suspension, resulting in a final detergent concentration of 2%. The suspension was homogenized and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 2 °C. The supernatant contained solubilized electroplax membranes. IgM was purified from an ammonium sulfate precipitate using an affinity column of polyacrylhydrazido-agarose resin. Purified IgM was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B as previously described (24James W.M. Emerick M.C. Agnew W.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6001-6009Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) at ratios of 1.35 mg of IgM per ml of resin. The IgM affinity resin was equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1% Genapol C-100, 0.2 mg/ml egg phosphatidylcholine, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.025% pepstatin, 0.025% leupeptin, 0.025% aprotinin). The solubilized electroplax membrane fraction was bound to the resin for 2 h. The protein was eluted using a linear gradient of buffer B supplemented with 3.0 m KCl. The eluted fractions were concentrated in a pressure ultrafiltration cell (Amicon) with a PBMK 300K membrane (Millipore). For electrophysiology studies, the sodium channel was reconstituted into liposomes by dialysis of the protein solution (concentration ∼ 50 μg/ml) overnight against 1 liter of 150 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1m Tris, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, using a Spectra/Por membrane (molecular mass cut-off, 100 kDa). For CD spectroscopy, the protein was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.1% Genapol C-100 to produce lipid/detergent mixed micelles. The solubilized and purified protein fractions were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after the method of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The gel was calibrated using standards ranging from 53 to 220 kDa. The 4–15% gradient PHAST acrylamide gels were silver-stained (26Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar), or the protein was electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For Western blot analysis, the primary antibody was an aliquot of the purified anti-sialic acid horse IgM. The secondary antibody was rabbit anti-horse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The relative protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic acid assay (27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The bicinchoninic acid analysis was calibrated for the absolute sodium channel protein concentration via duplicate quantitative amino acid analyses of the channel protein. For single channel conductance studies, planar lipid bilayers were formed using the tip-dip method, (28Hanke W. Methfessel C. Wilmsen G. Boheim G. Biochem. Bioenerg. J. 1984; 12: 329-339Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) i.e. at the tip of a patch-clamp pipette. A 1-ml Teflon chamber and the patch pipette were filled with electrolytic solution (0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, sterile filtered through 22 μm). The pipette solution, equivalent to the cis-side of the bilayer, was supplemented with 1 μm BTX. Ag/AgCl electrodes were employed in the bath and pipette. Bilayers were formed using the droplet technique, where 20 μl of a bacterial phosphatidylethanolamine/bovine phosphatidylserine/egg phosphatidylcholine (5:4:1) lipid solution (1 mg/ml in hexane) were applied to the micropipette shank just dipping at the air-salt solution interface. A triangular voltage waveform of amplitude ∼20 mV and frequency ∼100 Hz was applied to check capacitance values after bilayer formation. After checking bilayer stability and electrical silence under applied voltage, 20 μl of ∼50 μg/ml reconstituted sodium channels were added to the bath, i.e. thetrans-side. The pipette electrode was connected to the patch-amplifier through a preamplifier or headstage with a 1-giga-ohm resistor (or gain). The sampling rate was 3 kHz, and the low-pass Bessel filter was set at 300 Hz during data acquisition. Aliquots of samples to be used for CD spectroscopy were applied at a protein concentration of ∼50 μg/ml to carbon-coated copper grids and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. These were then examined with a TECNAI 1200Ex transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV. The CD spectra were obtained using an Aviv 215 spectropolarimeter, which was specially modified to have a large angle detection geometry (≥90 degrees) for scattering samples such as membrane proteins (29Wallace B.A. Mao D. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The instrument was calibrated with camphor sulfonic acid for optical rotation and benzene vapor for wavelength. Data were collected at 0.2-nm intervals, at a constant temperature of 25 °C over a wavelength range from 300 to 185 nm. Five scans were collected for each protein sample and baseline (consisting of the dialysate), and all samples were recorded in the same 0.02-cm pathlength Suprasil cuvette. The averaged baseline spectrum was subtracted from the averaged sample spectrum, and the net spectrum smoothed with a Savitsky-Golay filter (30Savitsky A. Golay M.J.E. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 1627-1639Crossref Scopus (15325) Google Scholar). Measurements were only made down to wavelengths where the instrument dynode voltage indicated that the detection was still within the linear range. The sodium channel protein (0.53 μm) was examined in the presence and absence of ligands, either lamotrigine (50 μm) or BTX (1.5 μm). To each sample, ligand dissolved in ethanol was added to produce a final ethanol concentration of 5%. Ethanol was added to the baselines in the same amount. An equivalent amount of ethanol was added to samples without ligand. Sodium channel samples with and without added ethanol produced identical CD spectra. Samples from several different preparations were examined with the same results. In the calculation of molar ellipticity, a mean residue mass of 114.5 daltons was used. The secondary structural analyses used DICHROWEB, an interactive webserver (31Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) that permits analyses via the following methods: SELCON3 (32Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Prot. Science. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar), CONTIN (33Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar, 34vanStokkum I.H.M. Spoelder H.J.W. Bloemendal M. vanGrondelle R. Groen F.C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), CDSSTR (35Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 252-260Crossref Scopus (2538) Google Scholar), and K2D (36Andrade M.A. Chacón P. Merelo J.J. Morán F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) with a wide range of protein spectral databases (all derived from soluble proteins (37Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar)). The normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) parameter (38Wallace B.A. Teeters C.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was calculated as a measure of the quality of the fit of the calculated structure to the data. NRMSD values of <0.1 mean that the calculated and experimental spectra are in close agreement (39Brahms S. Brahms J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 149-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment of the S6 transmembrane residues from domains I, III, and IV was carried out using PSI-BLAST (40Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) and displayed using Alscript (41Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Homology modeling of S5, the P-loops, and S6 from all four domains used the open MthK channel x-ray structure (PDB accession number1lnq) (42Jiang Y.X. Lee A. Chen J.Y. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) as the framework, since LTG binds to the inactivated form of the open channel. Areas of high homology between the sodium channel domains and potassium channel were aligned, i.e. S5 and S6 transmembrane segments based on both homology and secondary structure prediction. Non-homologous regions in the longer P-loops of domains I and III, which correspond to putative glycosylation sites, were deleted. The P-loops and N and C termini were modeled based on homologous segments of the KcsA channel structure (PDB accession number 1bl8). Sodium channel sequences were aligned versus the MthK channel using ClustalW (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar), and the structure was modeled employing the program Modeler 4 (44Šali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). Rigid-body minimization and simulated annealing of the model was carried out using the program CNS (45Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 904-921Crossref Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Docking studies between ligand and the channel model used the lamotrigine crystal structure (46Janes R.W. Lisgarten J.N. Palmer R.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. C Cryst. Struct. Commu. 1989; 45: 129-132Crossref Google Scholar) and the program AUTODOCK (47Goodsell D.S. Morris G.M. Olsen A.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 1996; 9: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). The regions of close association between the docked lamotrigine and the sodium channel model were identified using the CCP4 (48Collaborative Computational Project: Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) program CONTACT. The sodium channel from electric eel electroplax membranes was purified using procedures similar to those previously described (23Miller J.A. Agnew W.S. Levinson S.R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,24James W.M. Emerick M.C. Agnew W.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6001-6009Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications: the anti-sialic acid horse IgM affinity column was not eluted with colominic acid but instead was eluted with a KCl gradient as this resulted in higher yields and less degradation of the column, thus prolonging its useful lifetime. The presence of an enhanced mixture of protease inhibitors and the use of different buffers and detergent/lipid mixtures increased the yield and stability of the preparation. The eluted sodium channel was detected as a broad high molecular mass species on silver-stained gels (Fig.2 a) with an apparent molecular mass of ∼280–300 kDa and identified by Western blot analyses with anti-α-2,8-N-acetylneuraminic acid horse IgM (Fig.2 b). The electroplax sodium channel is reported to consist of 30% by mass of carbohydrate, 12% sialic acid (9Levinson S.R. Thornhill W.B. Duch D.S. Recio-Pinto E. Urban B.W. Narahashi T. Ion Channels. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 33-64Google Scholar). Quantitative amino acid analyses were consistent with the reported sequence of the electroplax sodium channel (data not shown). Negative stain electron microscopy of the samples to be used for CD spectroscopy showed that they contained micelles, each consisting of a single protein with pseudo-4-fold symmetry and a central pore, as described earlier (16Sato C. Ueno Y. Asai K. Takahashi K. Sato M. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2001; 409: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Dynamic light scattering studies also showed the CD samples to be consistent with monomeric micellar species. 2N. B. Cronin, unpublished results. To demonstrate that the sodium channel retained functionality after purification and reconstitution, single channel conductance experiments in planar lipid bilayers were carried in the presence of BTX (Fig. 3 a). BTX was used to remove the fast inactivation process, thus allowing single-channel events to be recorded with applied steady-state voltages. The single-channel conductance of 17.5 pS from the I–V plot (Fig.3 b) is within the range of values published from similar studies on the sodium channel (e.g. Ref. 49Recio-Pinto E. Duch D.S. Levinson S.R. Urban B.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 375-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 50Bendahhou S. Thoiron B. Duclohier H. C. R. Acad. Sci.

The identity and functionality of the channel under investigation was confirmed by tetrodotoxin (TTX) block using 1 μm on both sides. CD spectroscopy was used to examine the secondary structure of the purified sodium channel protein. CD spectra of membrane proteins in lipid bilayers are subject to distortions due to optical artifacts such as differential light scattering and absorption flattening (29Wallace B.A. Mao D. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To avoid these effects, the CD spectra of the sodium channel were measured in lipid/detergent mixed micelles, where such effects are negligible (52Mao D. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2667-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The native sodium channel gives rise to a spectrum that is characteristic of a protein with a high α-helical content, having peaks at ∼221, 208, and ≤190 nm and a zero cross-over near 200 nm (Fig. 4 a). Secondary structural analyses were performed for all spectra using a range of algorithms and reference databases derived from soluble proteins (31Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The analysis program CDSSTR (with reference database 3) consistently produced the closest correspondence between experimental data sets and calculated spectra (based on NRMSD values), so its results are reported here: an α-helix content of 55% (Table I). However, virtually identical results were found for all methods tested. Indeed, nine different combinations of algorithms and reference data bases produced solutions with n.r.m.s.d. values of ≤0.1. The average value of the helix content from all these was 56%; this high correspondence of results obtained by different methods increases our confidence level in the veracity of the calculated values.Table ICalculated secondary structuresSample% Secondary StructureHelixSheetTurnOtherNRMSDaNRMSD is the parameter reflecting the goodness-of-fit between the calculated secondary structure and the experimental data.Native55196200.002Native + LTG64106190.005Native + BTX61146190.005Native + both68124150.003a NRMSD is the parameter reflecting the goodness-of-fit between the calculated secondary structure and the experimental data. Open table in a new tab As a precaution, however, although the NRMSD values indicate a good correspondence between the calculated secondary structures and the actual structures, CD as a technique is most accurate in determining helix content. As a result, in this paper, discussions of the secondary structures will concentrate on the helix content of the protein. Furthermore, the interpretation of the analyses must bear in mind that all the reference data sets used in the analyses are derived from soluble proteins as they are the only ones currently available. Since the CD spectra of membrane proteins tend to have slightly different spectral characteristics (53Chen Y. Wallace B.A. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 65: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), this could lead to some inaccuracy in the absolute values of the secondary structures calculated, although the changes in secondary structures measured will, in general, be unaffected.

https://openalex.org/W2038137963,"Members of the BCL-2-related antiapoptotic family of proteins have been shown previously to regulate ATP/ADP exchange across the mitochondrial membranes and to prevent the loss of coupled mitochondrial respiration during apoptosis. We have found that BCL-2/BCL-xL can also improve mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in cells harboring pathogenic mutations in mitochondrial tRNA genes. The effect of BCL-2 overexpression in mutated cells was independent from apoptosis and was presumably associated with a modulation of adenine nucleotide exchange between mitochondria and cytosol. These results suggest that BCL-2 can regulate respiratory functions in response to mitochondrial distress by regulating the levels of adenine nucleotides.

These results suggest that BCL-2 can regulate respiratory functions in response to mitochondrial distress by regulating the levels of adenine nucleotides. The proto-oncogene BCL-2 prevents apoptosis and some forms of cellular necrosis (1Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Google Scholar), although the exact mechanisms of its anti-cell death function are not known. BCL-2 was shown to localize to multiple cell compartments, including the outer mitochondrial membrane (2Monaghan P. Robertson D. Amos T.A. Dyer M.J. Mason D.Y. Greaves M.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1819-1825Google Scholar). A number of functions related to mitochondria have been proposed for BCL-2, including the capacity to prevent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (3Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Waguri S. Uchiyama Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 21-29Google Scholar), which might be responsible for the activation of certain apoptotic pathways (4Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Google Scholar). In addition, BCL-xL, another member of the BCL-2 antiapoptotic family of proteins, was shown to regulate ATP/ADP exchange across the mitochondrial membranes and to prevent the loss of coupled mitochondrial respiration in response to proapoptotic stimuli (5Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Google Scholar, 6Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 159-167Google Scholar). It was proposed that the ability of the BCL-2 family of proteins to maintain mitochondrial integrity after proapoptotic stimuli might be related to maintaining the voltage-dependent anion channel of the outer mitochondrial membrane in an open configuration. This would prevent the accumulation of anions, particularly ADP, ATP, and creatine-PO4, in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (5Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Google Scholar, 6Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol.

Moreover, BCL-xL overexpression can stimulate mitochondrial respiration in cultured cells independent of the induction of apoptosis (8Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7087-7094Google Scholar). Mutations in mtDNA are associated with a heterogeneous group of sporadic or maternally inherited metabolic disorders. Usually these mutations cause impairment of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) 1The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; MT, mutant; WT, wild type; MERRF, myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibers; MELAS, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes; STP, staurosporine; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; ATPc, cytosolic ATP; ATPm, mitochondrial ATP with a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthesis (9DiMauro S. Bonilla E. Davidson M. Hirano M. Schon E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 199-210Google Scholar). We studied the effect of BCL-2 and BCL-xL overexpression on mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP pools in human transmitochondrial cybrid lines containing normal mtDNA, mutated mtDNA causing defective respiratory chains, and cells lacking mtDNA (ρ0 cells), which have no functioning respiratory chain. We found that in both wild type (WT) and mtDNA mutant (MT) cells BCL-2 and BCL-xLoverexpression tended to equalize the relative ATP content in the two cell compartments, presumably promoting its exchange across the mitochondrial membranes. We investigated the effect of BCL-2 and BCL-xL expression in cells harboring pathogenic mutations in mitochondrial tRNA-coding genes to assess whether modulation of anion exchange and the protective effect on mitochondrial function could improve defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain caused by mtDNA mutations. We showed that antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members ameliorated the defective OXPHOS phenotype in three different cell lines harboring distinct mitochondrial tRNA gene mutations. These data raise the possibility that BCL-2 might have a more general protective function against insulting agents on mitochondrial physiology that is not necessarily limited to its antiapoptotic properties. HumanBCL-2 cDNA was cloned in the EcoRI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). HumanBCL-XL (a gift from Lawrence Boise, University of Miami) cloned in the expression vector pIRESneo (Clontech) was obtained as described previously (8Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7087-7094Google Scholar). The human osteosarcoma mtDNA-less cell line (143B/206ρ0 cells) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose (4.5 g/liter) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μg/ml uridine. 143B/206ρ0 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-BCL-2 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. G418 (GeneticinTM; Invitrogen)-resistant clones were selected and screened for BCL-2 expression by Western blotting using specific monoclonal antibodies against human BCL-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). One 143B/206ρ0 clone with high BCL-2 expression (206ρ0BCL-2) was chosen for mtDNA repopulation. 206ρ0 BCL-xL cells were obtained as described previously (8Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7087-7094Google Scholar). Hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusing 206ρ0BCL-2 or 206ρ0 BCL-xL cells with previously described mutated (MT) T8356C and WT myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) (10Masucci J.P. Davidson M. Koga Y. Schon E.A. King M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2872-2881Google Scholar) and MT C3256T and WT mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) (11Hao H. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2347-2352Google Scholar) cybrids. Before fusion, MERRF and MELAS cybrids were treated for 2 h with 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, a DNA transcription and replication inhibitor, to limit the amount of nuclear DNA transferred from the cybrids to the BCL hybrids. Actinomycin D-treated cells (1 × 106) were washed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then fused to 1 × 106 206ρ0BCL-2 or ρ0206ρ0 BCL-xL cells as described previously (12King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Google Scholar). Cells were selected in a medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 and lacking uridine. Surviving cells were pooled in mass cultures. MERRF MT (8356) and MERRF MT (8344) (10Masucci J.P. Davidson M. Koga Y. Schon E.A. King M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2872-2881Google Scholar) cells were also directly transfected with pcDNA3 BCL-2 or with pcDNA3 empty vector as described above. In this case, cells were selected in 500 μg/ml GeneticinTM, and individual colonies were isolated for cell respiration and ATP synthesis analyses. WT, WTBCL-2, 143B, 143BBCLXL, 143B/206ρ0, 206ρ0BCL-2, MERRF MT (8356), and MERRF MTBCL-2 cells were transiently transfected as described previously with pcDNA3 expressing the ATP reporter luciferase targeted to the mitochondrial matrix or to the cytosol. Mitochondrial luciferase was generated by appending to the N terminus of luciferase the presequence of the mitochondrially targeted subunit VIII of cytochrome c oxidase. This construct has been shown to be efficiently imported into mitochondria (13Jouaville L.S. Pinton P. Bastianutto C. Rutter G.A. Rizzuto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13807-13812Google Scholar, 14Kennedy H.J. Pouli A.E. Ainscow E.K. Jouaville L.S. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13281-13291Google Scholar, 15Porcelli A.M. Pinton P. Ainscow E.K. Chiesa A. Rugolo M. Rutter G.A. Rizzuto R. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 353-380Google Scholar). Cytosolic luciferase was obtained by disrupting the natural C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence with a leucine to valine amino acid substitution at position 550 (16Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection with cytosolic luciferase or mitochondrial luciferase, aliquots of 2 × 105 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 mm pyruvate with or without 4.5 mg/ml glucose and incubated in a 24-well plate with gentle agitation at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 1 h, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 90 μl of 25 mmTricine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. 10 μl of 20 mmluciferin (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) was added, and luminescence was recorded in an Optocomp I luminometer (MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT). To normalize for the variability of luciferase expression, the luminescence values were expressed as a ratio to the “total potential luminescence” measured on 2 × 105 aliquots of the same cells lysed with a luciferase assay kit (Promega Inc.) containing 500 μm ATP. Apoptotic cell death induced by treatment with 0.5 μm staurosporine (STP) for 6 h was assessed by using a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on the basis of the detection of nucleosome breakdown as described previously (8Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7087-7094Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured in a 300-μl reaction chamber equipped with a Clark-type polarographic electrode as described previously (17Barrientos A. Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Cells were trypsinized, counted in a Z1 automated cell counter (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL), and resuspended at 1.5 × 106 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no glucose and no fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate. 1 μm carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupling agent, was added to a replicate sample to measure uncoupled respiration. Respiration rates were determined as the rates of oxygen consumption. Complex I-driven respiration was measured by polarography with and without rotenone (1 μm) and expressed as rotenone-sensitive oxygen consumption. Oligomycin-sensitive ATP synthesis was measured on digitonin-permeabilized cells using a luciferase-based kinetic assay as described previously (18Manfredi G. Gupta N. Vazquez-Memije M.E. Sadlock J.E. Spinazzola A. De Vivo D.C. Schon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9386-9391Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in the reaction buffer at 1 × 107/ml. Digitonin (50 μg/ml) was added to 160 μl of cell suspension followed by incubation for 1 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in 1 ml of reaction buffer, and the luminometric measurement was performed as described (18Manfredi G. Gupta N. Vazquez-Memije M.E. Sadlock J.E. Spinazzola A. De Vivo D.C. Schon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9386-9391Google Scholar) with and without the addition of 10 μg/ml oligomycin. Mitochondrial membrane potential was estimated using the membrane potential-sensitive dye 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3-′tetraethylbenzimidazole carbocyanide iodide (JC-1; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described (8Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7087-7094Google Scholar), except that cells were grown in 6-well plates to ∼80% confluence, and the JC-1 staining was performed directly on attached cells. Fluorescence was read at 535 (green monomer) and at 595 nm (orange aggregate) in an HTS 7000 plus plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mitochondrial membrane potential was expressed as the ratio of the absorbance at 595 nm to the absorbance at 535 nm. Hydrogen peroxide levels were measured in cells by 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes) fluorescence as described elsewhere (19Barrientos A. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16188-16197Google Scholar). Steady-state levels of mitochondrial peptides were studied by Western blotting. 20 μg of total cellular protein was separated onto 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After transfer, membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against human cytochrome c oxidase subunits I, II, and IV and the 39-kDa subunit of complex I (Molecular Probes) at 4 °C for 12 h and subsequently incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were developed with Supersignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) and quantified by densitometry using a Fluor-S analyzer (Bio-Rad). The humanBCL-2 cDNA cloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 was transfected into human osteosarcoma cells lacking mtDNA (143B/206ρ0). G418-resistant clones were screened for BCL-2 expression, and one high expressor (termed 206ρ0BCL-2) was selected. The 206ρ0BCL-2 line was then repopulated with exogenous WT mtDNA. Similarly, humanBCL-xL cDNA cloned in a pIRESneo vector was transfected into 143B/206ρ0 or in parental osteosarcoma 143B cells, and G418-resistant BCL-xL overexpressing clones were selected. The 206ρ0BCL-2 line was repopulated with exogenous mtDNA from cybrid clones derived from a patient harboring a C3256T transition in thetRNALeu(UUR) gene and from a patient with a T8356C transition in the tRNALys gene. The C3256T mutation has been associated with a disease clinically characterized by MELAS. The T8356C mutation causes a particular type of encephalopathy known as MERRF. Because in both patients the mutated mtDNA was heteroplasmic (i.e. MT and WT mtDNA coexisted), it was possible to isolate homoplasmic cybrid clones containing either exclusively MT or WT mtDNA. 206ρ0 cells are strictly auxotrophic for uridine. Thus, hybrid cells harboring the mitochondrial genotypes described above and expressing BCL-2 (termed MERRF MTBCL-2, MERRF WTBCL-2, MELAS MTBCL-2, MELAS WTBCL-2) were obtained by the fusion of 206ρ0BCL-2 cells with WT or MT MERRF and MELAS cybrids. We note that in all the experiments involving hybrids, we deliberately avoided isolating individual clones of repopulated cells and chose instead to study pools of clones to minimize artifacts caused by potential interclonal variability. As expected, all the newly produced hybrid cell lines expressing BCL-2 contained either MT or WT mtDNA (Fig. 1 A). In an independent set of experiments, 206ρ0 cells expressing BCL-xL were fused with MERRF and MELAS MT cybrids. The levels of BCL-2 in the expressor lines were ∼10–20-fold higher than the endogenous levels in untransfected cells (Fig. 1 B). The antiapoptotic function of BCL-2 was tested by measuring nucleosome breakdown before and after STP induction. BCL-2-overexpressing cells showed a marked decrease in the apoptotic response to STP (Fig.1 C). In addition, we observed that both untransfected MT cell lines displayed some degree of natural resistance against STP-induced apoptosis compared with their WT counterparts (Fig.1 C). It is possible that reduced mitochondrial ATP synthesis and membrane potential in MT cells could lead to decreased apoptotic response to STP as described previously in 143B/206ρ0 cells (8Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7087-7094Google Scholar) and in Jurkat T cells depleted of ATP by glucose deprivation combined with rotenone treatment (20Single B. Leist M. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 8-16Google Scholar). To measure ATP content, cells were transfected transiently with pcDNA3 containing the ATP reporter luciferase and engineered to be targeted to the mitochondrial matrix or to the cytosol. Cytosolic luciferase or mitochondrial luciferase-transfected cells were incubated in culture medium containing pyruvate with or without glucose. Relative ATP content was estimated by measuring luminescence after the addition of luciferin. In untransfected cells containing normal mtDNA (WT cybrids and 143B parental cells), the ratio between ATP content in the mitochondria (ATPm) and in the cytosol (ATPc) was lower in the presence of glucose than when pyruvate was the only substrate available. Overexpression of BCL-2 and BCL-xL significantly increased the ATPm:ATPc ratio in the presence of glucose but did not affect it in the presence of pyruvate alone (Fig. 2). Therefore, when cells competent for respiration were grown in pyruvate, medium mitochondrial ATP became predominant over cytosolic ATP. However, overexpression of BCL-2 or BCL-xL appeared to equalize the relative ATP concentrations between the two compartments in cells grown in glucose medium (Fig. 2). As expected, 206ρ0 cells, which are OXPHOS-incompetent, were completely depleted of ATP in pyruvate medium (not shown). In glucose medium, untransfected 206ρ0 cells had an equal ATPm:ATPc ratio as BCL-2-overexpressing 206ρ0. MERRF MT cybrids transfected with BCL-2 also showed an increased ATPm:ATPc ratio in the presence of glucose compared with mock-transfected MERRF MT cybrids. In MERRF MTBCL-2 cells the ATPm:ATPcratio was also increased when pyruvate was the only substrate in the medium, probably reflecting an improved respiratory function (Fig. 2). In fact, in pyruvate medium the absolute ATP contents in the two compartments were ∼10-fold higher in MERRF MT cells expressing BCL-2 than in mock transfected cells (not shown). These findings support the concept that BCL-2 and BCL-xL may play a role in modulating the exchange of ATP across the mitochondrial membranes, probably by promoting its equilibration between the intramitochondrial and extramitochondrial milieus. These results also suggest that BCL-2 may improve respiratory functions in mtDNA mutant cells. Mitochondrial ATP synthesis was measured in permeabilized cells with malate plus pyruvate as substrates. The rate of ATP synthesis was ∼10-fold lower in both MERRF MT and MELAS MT cells compared with the respective WT lines. In MTBCL-2cells, ATP synthesis was restored to ∼40% of WT levels (i.e. 4-fold increase; Fig.3 A). On the contrary, a moderate reduction (∼40–50%) of ATP synthesis was observed in WTBCL-2 cells as compared with their untransfected counterparts (Fig. 3 A). Mitochondrial respiration measured in MT cells (Fig. 3 B) was reduced to ∼15% of WT. However, in MTBCL-2 cells it was restored to ∼60% of WT values (i.e. a 4-fold increase). The addition of the protonophore FCCP, which completely uncouples mitochondria, increased cell respiration 2-fold in WT cells and to a lower degree in MT cells. The proportion by which respiration was induced by FCCP was substantially unchanged in BCL-2-expressing cells, suggesting that the increased respiration in intact cells was unlikely to be caused by the uncoupling of mitochondria by BCL-2. Mitochondrial membrane potential measured by the potentiometric mitochondrial dye JC-1 in medium containing glucose and pyruvate was significantly increased in both MTBCL-2 cell lines compared with untransfected cells but was still lower than in WT cells (Fig.3 C). The activity of respiratory chain complex I, measured as rotenone-sensitive cell respiration (Fig. 3 D), was severely decreased in MERRF MT and to an even greater extent in MELAS MT. In both MT cell lines, overexpression of BCL-2 partially restored complex I activity (∼40% of WT levels). To exclude the possibility that selection in medium lacking uridine (during the production of the different cell lines used in this study) might have favored the growth of spontaneous revertants, MERRF MT cybrids were also directly transfected with pcDNA3-BCL-2 or mock-transfected with pcDNA3 (neo) and selected in medium containing G418 and high glucose and supplemented with uridine. In addition, directly transfected cybrids served as controls for the extra dose of nuclear genes presumably present in the hybrids derived from fusion of cybrids with 206ρ0BCL-2 cells. MERRF MTBCL-2 and WTBCL-2 as well as mock-transfected clones were selected and mitochondrial respiration was measured. In this case, we could not use pools of clones because many G418-resistant cells might not express high levels of BCL-2. MERRF MTBCL-2clones had higher respiration rates than mock-transfected clones: 2.9 ± 0.4 and 1.7 ± 0.8 fmol of O2/min/cell, respectively (number of clones = 6; p < 0.01 (Fig. 3 B)), confirming the results described previously on MERRF MTBCL-2 hybrids created by fusion and selection in medium containing G418 and lacking uridine. In addition, to further confirm these findings, cybrids containing homoplasmic levels of a different, more severe, tRNALys mutation at nucleotide 8344 also associated with MERRF (21Wallace D.C. Zheng X.X. Lott M.T. Shoffner J.M. Hodge J.A. Kelley R.I. Epstein C.M. Hopkins L.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 601-610Google Scholar) were transfected with pcDNA3-BCL-2 or mock-transfected with pcDNA3 (neo) and selected in G418. MERRF 8344 MT clones overexpressing BCL-2 also showed improved cell respiration and ATP synthesis. Oxygen consumption in BCL-2 and mock-transfected MERRF 8344 MT clones was 1.2 ± 0.3 and 0.6 ± 0.3 fmol of O2/min/cell, respectively (number of BCL-2 expressing clones = 6; number of mock-transfected clones = 8;p < 0.002 as determined by unpaired Student'st test (Fig. 3 B)). ATP synthesis was increased 5.5-fold in BCL-2 MERRF 8344 MT over the mock transfected (number of clones = 5 in each group; p < 0.03 (not shown)). It has been suggested that members of the BCL-2 antiapoptotic protein family can protect cells from the potentially deleterious effects of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production that follow apoptotic stimuli (22Gottlieb E. Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5680-5689Google Scholar, 23Degli Esposti M. Hatzinisiriou I. McLennan H. Ralph S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29831-29837Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be hypothesized that if mitochondrial tRNA mutations cause increased reactive oxygen species production, BCL-2 overexpression could prevent damage to mitochondria by scavenging reactive oxygen species. However, hydrogen peroxide levels measured by H2DCFA dye in MT and WT cells growing in normal conditions without apoptotic stimuli were not increased in MT cells as compared with WT cells, and BCL-2 overexpression did not seem to affect hydrogen peroxide levels (not shown). To verify whether the effect of BCL-2 overexpression on MT cells could be mimicked by exogenous antioxidants, MERRF MT cells were grown for a prolonged period of time in the presence of 10 mmdihydrolipoic acid. This antioxidant agent has been shown to protect PC12 rat cells from cell death induced by mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors (24Seaton T.A. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H. Brain Res. 1997; 777: 110-118Google Scholar). Cells treated with dihydrolipoic acid for 1 or 2 weeks did not show any improvement in respiratory chain activities and cell respiration (not shown), further suggesting that protection from free radical damage is unlikely to play a major role in the biochemical improvement induced by BCL-2 overexpression. The steady-state levels of respiratory chain complex IV subunits I and II (cytochrome c oxidase I and II), which are encoded by the mtDNA, were markedly decreased in MT cells. BCL-2 overexpression did not modify the steady-state levels of these subunits in MERRF and MELAS MT cells (not shown). The levels of complex IV subunit IV (cytochrome c oxidase IV) and complex I 39-kDa subunit (CO I 39-kDa) that are both encoded by the nuclear DNA were similar in all cells and were unmodified by BCL-2 overexpression (not shown). This finding suggests that BCL-2 did not exert its effects on mitochondrial respiration by increasing the levels of mitochondrial enzymes, but rather by modulating their activities. It was suggested that BCL-xL is able to regulate mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP/ADP exchange across the mitochondrial membranes in cells deprived of growth factors (5Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Google Scholar, 6Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 159-167Google Scholar). BCL-2 has also been shown to promote H+ efflux from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space of isolated mitochondria as a mechanism to maintain membrane potential in response to uncoupling agents (3Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Waguri S. Uchiyama Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 21-29Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family of proteins might have a role in maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis that is not limited to their antiapoptotic properties. These findings also seem to point to adenine nucleotide translocation and transmembrane proton flux as potential critical sites for the action of BCL-2 proteins. In normal cells, ATP is generated both by glycolysis in the cytosol and by OXPHOS in mitochondria, from which it is exported to the other cellular compartments where most of it is used. We found that in untransfected WT cells the ATPm:ATPc ratio was higher in a medium without glucose (in which cells produce ATP mainly through oxidative phosphorylation) than when cells were grown with a high concentration of glucose. BCL-2 and BCL-xL appeared to increase the ATPm:ATPc ratio in glucose medium, presumably by promoting the ATP exchange across the mitochondrial membranes. Accordingly, we found that WT cells overexpressing BCL-2/BCL-xL had a significantly reduced mitochondrial ATP synthesis, possibly as a response to the increased ATPm:ATPc ratios. In WT cells, which have a normal respiratory chain, an increased ATPm:ATPc ratio may have an inhibitory effect on ATP synthase. On the contrary, we showed that BCL-2 expression increased the ATPm:ATPc ratio in cells harboring the MERRF mutation not only in glucose but also in the oxidative substrate pyruvate, and it stimulated mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. It was suggested that ATP/ADP translocation is the most efficient mechanism to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential in cells with a defective respiratory chain, such as ρ0 cells (25Buchet K. Godinot C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22983-22989Google Scholar). To maintain membrane potential in respiration-deficient cells, ATP is imported inside mitochondria and hydrolyzed by the F1-ATPase (Fig.4). Maintenance of a mitochondrial membrane potential, even if reduced, is necessary for cell survival, because crucial functions such as mitochondrial protein import and processing are membrane potential-dependent (26Suzuki C.K. Rep M. van Dijl J.M. Suda K. Grivell L.A. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 118-123Google Scholar, 27Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Google Scholar). This behavior could explain the differences between ATP production in wild type and in mutant cells. Cells harboring homoplasmic levels of mitochondrial tRNA mutations must rely primarily on glycolysis, because their mitochondrial ATP synthesis is extremely low. Therefore, it is likely that similar mechanisms to those described in ρ0 cells, which involve ATP/ADP exchange to maintain membrane potential, operate in mutated cells as well. The events through which BCL-2 and BCL-xL facilitate the exchange of creatine-PO4 and adenine nucleotides between cytosol and mitochondria in response to perturbations of cellular metabolism seem to occur at the level of the voltage-dependent anion channel in the outer mitochondrial membrane voltage-dependent anion channel (5Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Google Scholar). When mitochondrial production of ATP becomes low, as in the initial phases of apoptosis, or in cells that harbor mutations of the mtDNA, BCL-xL and BCL-2 might promote the exchange of ATP and ADP between mitochondria and cytosol. Mutant cells, which unlike ρ0 cells have some residual capability to maintain a functioning respiratory chain, could benefit from the higher mitochondrial membrane potential and higher intramitochondrial supplies of adenine nucleotides. At this point it is unclear how BCL-2 improves oxidative phosphorylation activity, but our results suggest that this effect is associated with increased ATP flux into mitochondria. This increased flux could stimulate oxidative phosphorylation by leading to the formation of ADP (through ATP-hydrolyzing reactions), which could directly stimulate the respiratory chain. Alternatively, BCL-2 could increase ATP-dependent functions of mitochondria containing mutated mtDNA, thereby increasing OXPHOS efficiency. This result could be accomplished, for instance, by improved stability of certain components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain such as cytochromec leading to more efficient electron transfer and OXPHOS. Improved OXPHOS efficiency may then increase membrane potential and ATP synthesis. In conclusion, we believe that antiapoptotic BCL-2-related proteins may have a role in the homeostasis of mitochondrial metabolism not only in response to apoptotic stimuli but also in a variety of conditions that require mitochondrial adaptation to metabolic stresses. BCL-2/BCL-xL can modulate the ATP gradient between mitochondria and cytosol, and their increased expression may not only protect cells during noxious stimuli but also improve energy metabolism within mitochondria with defective respiratory chain functions."
https://openalex.org/W2018010775,"In liver, phosphatidylethanolamine is converted to phosphatidylcholine through a series of three sequential methylation reactions. PhosphatidylethanolamineN-methyltransferase (PEMT) catalyzes each transmethylation reaction, andS-adenosylmethionine is the methyl group donor. Biochemical analysis of human liver revealed that the methyltransferase activity is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-associated membranes. Bioinformatic analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence suggested that the enzyme adopts a polytopic conformation in those membranes. To elucidate the precise membrane topography of PEMT and thereby provide the basis for in-depth functional characterization of the enzyme, we performed endoproteinase-protection analysis of epitope-tagged, recombinant protein. Our data suggest a topographical model of PEMT in which four transmembrane regions span the membrane such that both the N and C termini of the enzyme are localized external to the ER. Two hydrophilic connecting loops protrude into the luminal space of the microsomes whereas a corresponding loop on the cytosolic side remains proximate to the membrane. Further support for this model was obtained following endoproteinase-protection analysis of mutant recombinant PEMT derivatives in which specific protease cleavage sites had been genetically engineered or ablated.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Google Scholar, 2Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, an additional and substantial demand is imposed on the PC pool by the liver-specific functions of bile and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle production and secretion (3Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2002: 433-448Google Scholar, 4Mathur S.N. Born E. Murthy S. Field F.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 569-575Google Scholar). The phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) and CDP-choline biosynthetic pathways mediate continual replenishment of the hepatic PC pools (5Vance D.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2002: 205-232Google Scholar). The liver is the primary site of PEMT activity whereas the enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway are active in all nucleated cells (2Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Google Scholar, 6Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Google Scholar). PC biosynthesis is clearly essential to liver function, but why that synthesis must be conducted through two distinct pathways is less evident. Recent studies investigating the proportion of hepatic PC that is derived from each pathway defined the PEMT-controlled pathway as the source of 30% of hepatic PC with the CDP-choline pathway accounting for 70% (7DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Google Scholar, 8Reo N.V. Adinehzadeh M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 164: 113-126Google Scholar, 9Reo N.V. Adinehzadeh M. Foy B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1580: 171-188Google Scholar). Significantly perhaps, data from one group also revealed that the PEMT pathway is a metabolically channeled process suggesting that PEMT-derived PC may be destined for a specific function (9Reo N.V. Adinehzadeh M. Foy B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1580: 171-188Google Scholar). Given that PEMT is primarily expressed in liver, PEMT-derived PC might be targeted to a liver-specific fate such as VLDL particles or bile (10Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4486-4491Google Scholar, 11Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 21-31Google Scholar, 12Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Okochi E. Takahashi A.

In efforts to address these hypotheses, studies were recently conducted using hepatocytes from mice homozygous for a disrupted PEMT allele. The data revealed a defect in the secretion of triacylglycerol and apo B100, key components of VLDL particles, suggesting that PEMT is required for optimal VLDL assembly and/or secretion (14Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Google Scholar). Additional studies investigating a role for PEMT in bile production or secretion are currently in progress. Metabolic channeling is central to several metabolic processes including glycolysis and glycogenolysis and involves the retention of metabolites in a specific microenvironment to promote consecutive enzymatic reactions and hence efficient energy utilization (15Al-Habori M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 27: 123-132Google Scholar). For metabolic channeling to be effective, however, spatial organization is requisite. Thus, not only should enzymes and substrates be localized in the same cellular subcompartment, but enzymes must also be topographically organized such that key catalytic residues or motifs are correctly oriented. Liver is the primary site of human PEMT expression, with extra-hepatic PEMT accounting for a mere fraction of corporeal expression (6Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Google Scholar,16Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Google Scholar, 17Panagia V. Ganguly P.K. Dhalla N.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Herein, biochemical analysis of human liver reveals that PEMT is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a subfraction of ER membranes that co-fractionate with mitochondria, mitochondria associated membranes (MAM). However, the exact topography of the enzyme within those membranes has not been determined. Resolution of the topographical orientation of PEMT will permit further analysis of the role of metabolic partitioning in PC biosynthesis. Moreover, it will provide the basis for in depth exploration of the mechanism by which PEMT becomes rate-limiting in the secretion of VLDL particles. Bioinformatic analysis predicts that PEMT is a polytopic membrane protein with four transmembrane domains and thus yields a model that positions the N and C termini of the enzyme in the same intracellular compartment (21Walkey C.J. Shields D.J. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 405-412Google Scholar). However, in silico analysis cannot resolve whether the end termini of PEMT reside in the cytosol or in the microsomal lumen. Here, we detail the biochemical validation of a topographical model of PEMT, using endoproteinase protection analysis of functional epitope-tagged derivatives of the enzyme. These studies will provide the basis for detailed structural and functional characterization of the human enzyme. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, restriction endonucleases, and Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase were from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis and epitope tagging were synthesized at the DNA core facility in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta. FuGENE transfection reagent was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.S-Adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (15 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Non-radiolabeledS-adenosyl-l-methionine, anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone HA-7), and endoproteinase Lys-C were from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) antibody was fromStressgen Biotech. Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were of the highest standard commercially available. Adult human liver samples were obtained from the Department of Surgery at the University Of Alberta Hospital and were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen at resection. Differential subcellular fractionation was performed according to the procedure of Croze and Morre (22Croze E. Morre D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 46-57Google Scholar) as modified by Vance (23Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Google Scholar), yielding fractions corresponding to ER, nucleus, plasma membrane, mitochondria, MAM, and Golgi apparatus. Protein concentrations of individual fractions were measured by the Bradford method, using albumin as standard. Microsomes for protease protection analysis were prepared by a modified version of the method of Graham (24Graham J.M. Graham J.M. Rickwood D. Subcellular Fractionation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 205-242Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h post-transfection with the various human PEMT (hPEMT) recombinant plasmids, COS-7 cells were washed, harvested into phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted at 1000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA), sonicated for 5 s, and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 15 min to pellet nuclei, heavy mitochondria, plasma membrane, Golgi, and cell debris. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged for 45 min, at 99,000 × rpm at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 75 μl of Tris-buffered saline by pipetting gently 20 times. Protein concentrations of the prepared microsomes were determined by the Bradford method. Integrity of the microsomes was verified by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody against the ER luminal marker, PDI. Hydropathy analysis, based on the method of Kyte and Doolittle (25Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) was performed on the predicted human PEMT amino acid sequence (GenBankTM accession number NP_009100), using the Grease program of the San Diego Supercomputer Center Biology Workbench (workbench.sdsc.edu). The TMAP program in the Biology Workbench was employed to predict the position and length of individual transmembrane domains (26Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Google Scholar). All plasmids were constructed using the wild-type hPEMT-pCI plasmid as template (21Walkey C.J. Shields D.J. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 405-412Google Scholar). This plasmid consists of the human PEMT open reading frame cloned 5′ to 3′ into the XhoI and XbaI sites, respectively, of the pCI mammalian expression vector polylinker (Promega). Transcription is under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. Using PCR, an oligonucleotide encoding an HA (YPYDVPDYA)-tagged epitope was appended to the 5′ end of hPEMT to generate the plasmid, HA-hPEMT. PCR products were blunt-end ligated into SmaI-cut pBluescript II (KS) (Stratagene) and recloned to pCI using XhoI andXbaI restriction sites. Mutant PEMT derivatives for protease protection analysis were generated by the “splice by overlap extension” PCR mutagenesis method, using the HA-hPEMT plasmid as template (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). Full-length mutant products were subcloned into the pCI expression vector as detailed above. All constructs were sequenced to confirm fidelity of PCR and orientation of the insert at the Molecular Biology Services Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta. To mutagenize the two lysines at positions 38 and 41 in loop A to arginine residues, generating the HA-tagged double mutant HA-AK2R2, PCR A was performed with oligonucleotides 1 (5′-CTCGAGATGTATCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTATGCTACCCGGCTGCTGGGCTACGTGGACCCCCTG-3′) and 2 (5′-TGTTCCCATCGTGCAACCACATTCCAG-3′), PCR B was performed with oligonucleotides 3 (5′-GTGGTTGCACGATGGGAACACAGGACCCGCAGGCTGAGCAGGGCCTTCG-3′) and 4 (5′-TCTAGATCAGCTCCTCTTGTGGGACCCGGAGGCT-3′), and PCR C, to generate the full-length mutant product, was performed with oligonucleotides 1 and 4, using amplicons from PCR A and B as templates. To mutate the two C- terminal lysines at positions 191 and 197 to arginine residues and generate the HA-tagged double mutant HA-CK2R2, PCR D was performed with oligonucleotides 1 and 5 (5′-TCTAGATCAGCTCCTCCTGTGGGACCCGGAGGCTCTCTGCCG-3′). To insert a novel endoproteinase Lys-C cleavage site into loop B, the arginine residue at position 80 was mutated to a lysine, generating the plasmid HA-R80K. This was achieved as follows: PCR E was performed with oligonucleotides 1 and 6 (5′-GGCTGGCTCAGCATGGCCTG-3′), PCR F was performed with oligonucleotides 7 (5′-CAGGCCATGCTGAGCCAGCCCAAGATGGAGAGCCTGGAC-3′) and 4, and the full-length product, using PCR products E and F as template, was generated using oligonucleotides 1 and 4. Each full-length mutant amplicon was recloned into pCI as described. COS-7 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection repository, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. On day 0, cells were plated at a confluency of 1.75 × 106 cells/60-mm dish. After an overnight incubation, cells were transfected with test plasmids or mock transfected with empty pCI expression vector using FuGENE transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol. Specifically, we used 5 μl FuGENE/3 μg DNA plasmid per 60-mm dish. Cells were harvested 24 h later and treated as described in the figure legends. PEMT activity assays were performed as described previously (28Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 366-374Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, COS-7 cells were washed with and harvested into phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted at 1000 × g, and resuspended in Buffer B (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA). Following homogenization by sonication, protein homogenates (50 μg) were assayed for PEMT activity using phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) as a methyl acceptor andS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine as the methyl group donor. Cell homogenate proteins (25 μg) were separated by Tris/glycine SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels calibrated with prestained molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and immunoblotted with primary antibodies at the indicated concentration. Protein-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) as directed. Membranes were exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for the indicated time at room temperature. Endoproteinase protection analyses were performed on microsomes prepared from transfected COS-7 cells as described above. Briefly, microsomal proteins (50 μg) were incubated with 1% Triton X-100 or 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, on ice for 30 min. Endoproteinase Lys-C (0, 0.1, or 1 μg) was added to the mixture (final reaction volume, 20 μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Each reaction was stopped by the addition of Buffer C (5× 60 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 715 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 10 min. Endoproteinase cleavage products were separated by Tris/glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted as described above. Integrity of the microsomes was validated by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-PDI antibody. Early studies on human PEMT identified the liver as the primary site of expression, which parallels the expression pattern of PEMT in rodents (6Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Google Scholar, 29Shields D.J. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 105-114Google Scholar). Although the rat PEMT activity is distributed between ER and MAM, only the isoform designated PEMT2, in the MAM fraction, is immunoreactive with an antibody raised against a C-terminal rat PEMT peptide (16Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Google Scholar). To determine whether the human enzyme displays similar disparity in the localization of enzymatic activity and immunoreactivity, subcellular fractionation of human liver was performed. Similar to rodents, the human PEMT activity is primarily localized to ER and MAM (Fig. 1 A), but unlike rodents the human PEMT enzyme is also immunoreactive to the anti-PEMT peptide antibody in both ER and MAM (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblotting with anti-PDI confirmed that the fractions representing ER and MAM (which is a subfraction of ER) were of ER origin (Fig. 1 C). As the activity and immunoreactivity of human PEMT are superimposable, it appears that the differential subcellular localization of PEMT isoforms, as observed in the rat, has not been conserved in evolution. Purification of PEMT revealed the enzyme to be an integral membrane protein (30Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17231-17239Google Scholar). To gain insight into the topography of PEMT in the membranes of ER/MAM, the deduced amino acid sequence was examined in silico using the method of Kyte and Doolittle (25Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar). The hydropathy profile of PEMT shown in Fig. 2 A predicts the presence of four hydrophobic regions. Each hydrophobic region exceeds 20 amino acids in length and registers a value of >2 units on the hydropathy plot, two properties strongly indicative of a transmembrane domain. A polytopic model based on four transmembrane α-helical domains colocalizes the N and C termini on one side of the membrane plane, suggesting that PEMT adopts one of two opposing topographical orientations (both termini in the lumen or both termini in the cytosol). To investigate which of the two possible topographical models is valid, intact microsomes were prepared from transfected cells and subjected to endoproteinase digestion in the absence or presence of detergent. In the absence of detergent, proteolysis is expected to occur only at exposed cleavage sites on the microsomal exterior, and the luminally oriented sites should remain protected. Cleavage of protected luminally oriented sites should occur only in the presence of detergent. The protease utilized in these studies, endoproteinase Lys-C, specifically cleaves at the C terminus of lysine residues, and, given the position of the lysine residues within the PEMT amino acid sequence, was expected to yield an informative proteolytic pattern (Fig. 2,B and C). To perform the topographical analyses, an antibody capable of detecting proteolytic cleavage products was required. An antibody against a peptide corresponding to an epitope at the extreme C terminus of PEMT was raised previously, but this epitope contains two lysine residues (endoproteinase Lys-C cleavage sites) with the consequence that proteolysis would result in cleavage at these residues and destruction of the epitope. Therefore, although this antibody is informative for the localization of the C terminus, it would not be expected to yield interpretable results for the remainder of the protein. To circumvent this problem a HA tag, which does not contain lysine residues, was appended to the N terminus of PEMT. Hydropathy analysis of the epitope-tagged protein sequence did not predict changes in the number or length of the predicted transmembrane domains. Furthermore, the HA-tagged PEMT expressed in COS-7 cells is enzymatically active (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblotting verified the production of recombinant proteins (Fig. 3 B) and faithful recognition of the HA antigen tag by the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3 C). To analyze which one of the two possible membrane topographic models of PEMT is valid, a plasmid encoding HA-tagged PEMT was transfected into COS-7 cells. Subsequently, microsomes were prepared and incubated with various concentrations of endoproteinase Lys-C in the absence or presence of Triton X-100, and the resultant proteolytic products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4 A). In microsomes incubated without protease, an immunoreactive band corresponding to the epitope-tagged PEMT was detectable at ∼22 kDa in the absence or presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 2). In the presence of endoproteinase, but in the absence of Triton X-100, the ∼22-kDa band was replaced by one of increased electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 5). This is indicative of cleavage at the C-terminal lysine residues, which generates a truncation product lacking the final eight residues of the epitope-tagged protein. As proteolysis occurred in the absence of detergent, this result suggests that the C terminus of PEMT is localized external to the microsomes. To confirm that the endoproteinase was functional in the absence of Triton X-100, and hence that the electrophoretic shift observed in Fig. 4 A (lanes 3–6) was because of proteolytic cleavage, duplicate proteolytic products were immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-PEMT antibody. Protease treatment, in the absence or presence of Triton X-100, resulted in destruction of the C-terminal PEMT epitope and consequently, a loss of immunoreactivity, confirming that the protease remained active (Fig. 4 B,lanes 3–6). In the presence of Triton X-100, the C-terminal truncation product was again evident, but a reduction in intensity resulted as protease concentrations increased (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and6). This was because of proteolysis at the previously inaccessible luminal cleavage sites. Digestion in the presence of Triton X-100 also resulted in the appearance of a fast migrating band of ∼5.2 kDa (lanes 4 and 6). This band corresponds to the expected proteolytic product resulting from cleavage at the lysine residues in loop A. The diffuse appearance of the 5.2-kDa immunoreactive band is probably because of the high concentration of proteolytic fragments in this region of the gel. Given the appearance of this immunoreactive band only in the presence of detergent, loop A appears to reside in the ER lumen. To verify the integrity of the prepared microsomes, duplicate proteolysis products were immunoblotted with an antibody against the ER luminal marker, PDI (Fig. 4 C). In the absence of detergent, a 57-kDa immunoreactive band was detectable, indicating protection of the epitope and thus demonstrating the integrity of the microsomes (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1, 3, and5). In the presence of detergent, proteolysis abolished the immunoreactivity of PDI, demonstrating that the detergent permeabilized the microsomes and that the protease was active (Fig. 4 C,lanes 4 and 6). These data support the validity of a topographical model that localizes both termini external to the microsomes (Fig. 4 D). Further analysis of the proposed topography of PEMT required the design of three novel HA-tagged PEMT derivatives. To confirm the specificity of cleavage at the lysine residues in the C terminus (Fig. 4 A), both residues were mutated to arginine residues to generate the plasmid HA-CK2R2. To evaluate the proposed cytosolic localization of loop B, a mutant version of PEMT was generated in which a lysine residue and hence endoproteinase site was engineered into loop B, resulting in the plasmid HA-R80K. To confirm the specificity of cleavage at the two lysine residues in loop A, and to investigate the orientation of loop C, a third plasmid, HA-AK2R2, was generated in which both lysine residues in loop A were mutated to arginine residues. To ensure that the mutant constructs retained PEMT activity, each construct was transfected into COS-7 cells, and activity assays were performed. Cells transfected with each mutant construct displayed equal (HA-AK2R2) or greater (HA-CK2R2, HA-R80K) PEMT activity compared with cells expressing the unmodified PEMT enzyme (Fig. 5 A), signifying that the structure and topography required for enzymatic activity are retained. Immunoblots demonstrated similar levels of expression of the recombinant proteins (Fig. 5 B). In the next set of experiments, the plasmid HA-CK2R2, encoding hPEMT, which lacks the C-terminal proteolysis sites (Fig. 4 A), was transfected into COS-7 cells to evaluate the specificity of endoproteinase cleavage at the C-terminal lysine residues. Microsomes were prepared from the transfected cells, and protease protection experiments were conducted as before. Digestion of the microsomes with various concentrations of the protease, in the absence of Triton X-100, did not change the electrophoretic mobility of the ∼22-kDa band that corresponds to the full-length tagged mutant protein (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1–6). This contrasts with data obtained from the HA-hPEMT proteolysis experiments (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3–6), in which the C-terminal lysine residues are intact, and cleavage results. This result supports the notion that the C terminus of PEMT resides in the cytosol, validating our earlier findings and one portion of our predicted model (Fig. 4 D). As anticipated, proteolytic products from microsomes treated with protease in the presence of detergent (lanes 4 and 6) were similar to those generated from protection experiments on HA-hPEMT (Fig. 4 A,lanes 4 and 6). Reprobing of the membranes with a polyclonal anti-PDI antibody verified the integrity of the microsomal membranes (Fig. 6 C). The topographical model in Fig. 4 D postulated that loop B is exposed to the cytosol. To examine this hypothesis, COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmid HA-R80K, which contains an engineered endoproteinase site in loop B. Proteolysis in the absence of detergent was predicted to yield a novel immunoreactive proteolytic fragment reflecting cleavage at the exposed loop B site. However, cleavage did not occur in the absence of detergent (results not shown), suggesting that the engineered cleavage site is protected and that loop B is localized proximate to the membrane. Given the length and hydrophobicity of each predicted transmembrane domain, a bitopic model based on two transmembrane domains that would orient loop B into the ER lumen is unlikely. Thus, although the topography of loop B remains indeterminate, a model positioning the hydrophilic connecting loop contiguous with the external leaflet of the membrane bilayer is favored. In the final set of experiments, the plasmid HA-AK2R2, in which the cleavage sites in loop A are abolished (Fig. 7 A), was transfected into COS-7 cells, and protease protection analysis was performed. As anticipated, results from the protease protection experiments conducted in the absence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 7 B, lanes 1,3, and 5) were similar to those from similar experiments on HA-hPEMT (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1,3, and 5). However, in the presence of detergent, addition of protease failed to yield a proteolytic fragment of ∼5.2 kDa (Fig. 7 B, lanes 4 and 6), confirming that the 5.2-kDa fragment generated following cleavage of HA-hPEMT was a result of specific proteolysis at the lysine residues in loop A (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and 6). Hence, the predicted luminal localization of loop A is supported. Furthermore, proteolysis in the presence of Triton X-100 yielded a fragment of ∼15 kDa as postulated. Previously, this product was not generated because of the presence of the loop A cleavage sites within the 15-kDa fragment. However, following ablation of the loop A sites, the 15-kDa proteolytic product was generated following cleavage at the lysine residue in loop C. Given that the appearance of this product occurs only in the presence of detergent, our notion of a luminal orientation for loop C is supported. Immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-PDI antibody confirmed the integrity of the microsomes and thus the interpretation of our results. Expression of the human PEMT gene is greatest in the liver, and here we demonstrate that the encoded PEMT protein is enriched subcellularly in both the ER and MAM (Fig. 1). This contrasts with findings in rats where two isoforms of PEMT exist that are distinguishable on the basis of immunoreactivity with an antibody raised against a rat PEMT C-terminal peptide; PEMT1 is localized to the ER whereas PEMT2 is confined to the MAM (16Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Google Scholar). However, in humans, PEMT activity and immunoreactivity are detectable in both the ER and MAM suggesting that the differential subcellular localization of PEMT isoforms may be confined to rodents (Fig. 1). Although the localization of PEMT within the human hepatic ultrastructure has now been revealed, factors that direct PEMT to the specific subcellular compartment remain to be identified. Targeting of ER membrane proteins is a well defined process that is modulated by specific retention or retrieval signals (31Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Google Scholar, 32Nilsson T. Warren G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 517-521Google Scholar). Whereas the first transmembrane segment of some polytopic proteins serves to “retain” the protein in the ER membrane, a C-terminal dilysine motif (KKXX or KXKXX) can similarly confer ER localization, albeit through retrieval from an intermediate compartment (31Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Google Scholar, 32Nilsson T. Warren G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 517-521Google Scholar). A C-terminal dilysine motif is present in the yeast PEM2 amino acid sequence, but this motif is not conserved in the higher eukaryotes. However, a hybridXHKRX motif is conserved in the rat, mouse, and human amino acid sequences. Moreover, in certain instances, it has been demonstrated that mutagenesis of one lysine in the dilysine motif to an arginine or a histidine residue can occur without detriment to ER targeting (33Hardt B. Bause E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 751-757Google Scholar). Because histidine and arginine residues flank the C-terminal lysine residue, one of several amino acid combinations could potentially mediate ER targeting. For a dilysine motif to be functional as an ER targeting signal, a cytosolic orientation is requisite. Our proposed topographical model for PEMT in which the C terminus is localized to the cytosol conforms to this requirement. Further analysis would be required to determine the relative contribution of theXHKRX motif to the subcellular distribution of PEMT. Elucidation of the subcellular distribution of the integral membrane protein, PEMT, prompted an investigation of the topographical orientation of PEMT in the microsomal membranes. Although early trypsin-proteolysis studies suggested that certain domains of PEMT were localized external to the microsomal membranes, the specific membrane topography of PEMT had, until now, remained elusive (34Audubert F. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 792: 359-362Google Scholar). Here, we present data that are consistent with the tetra-span membrane topography model of PEMT shown in Fig. 2 B. Bioinformatic analysis of the PEMT amino acid sequence revealed the presence of four regions of hydrophobicity that varied in length between 23 and 29 amino acids. Separating the putative transmembrane α-helical regions are short hydrophilic loops (A, B, and C) that range from 8 to 29 residues in length. Although the exact functional significance of the length of the short loops remains undefined, this structural organization may facilitate juxtaposition of distinct functional domains from the adjoining transmembrane α-helices. Such an alignment is not without precedent, as the topography of two enzymes central to cellular cholesterol homeostasis (i.e. sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-activating protein and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase) features a series of five closely aligned transmembrane domains that together constitute a conserved sterol-sensing domain (35Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Google Scholar, 36Olender E.H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4223-4235Google Scholar). Because each hydrophobic region of the PEMT protein exceeds the minimum length considered necessary for the formation of a transmembrane segment (20 amino acids), and because of the relative hydrophobicity (>2 units) of each segment, a membrane topography based on four transmembrane domains is proposed (Fig. 2 B) (37Van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 13-33Google Scholar). In contrast, whereas the yeast ortholog (PEM2) is proposed to be similarly polytopic, one portion of the yeast protein contains a hydrophobic stretch of 31 amino acids, which, intriguingly, is the minimum length required for the formation of a helical hairpin (helix-turn-helix) in the membrane (38Monne M. Nilsson I. Elofsson A. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 807-814Google Scholar). Moreover, a pair of residues with helix turn-inducing propensity (lysine-proline) is centrally located in the 31-residue hydrophobic segment (39Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Google Scholar, 40Monne M. Hermansson M. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 141-145Google Scholar). However, as each putative transmembrane domain of the human protein ranges in length from 23 to 29 amino acids and is thus below the minimum requirement for the formation of a helical hairpin, the four human transmembrane α-helical regions are not predicted to reorient within the membrane plane. Protease protection analysis of epitope-tagged PEMT in intact microsomes revealed that the C terminus is sensitive to proteolytic digestion and hence is exposed to the cytosol, whereas both hydrophilic loops A and C are protease-resistant and are thus predicted to reside in the lumen (see Fig. 4 A, Fig. 6 B, and Fig. 7 B). Although the orientation of loop B and the N terminus of PEMT were not resolved unequivocally in the present studies, a hydropathy profile that is strongly indicative of a tetra-spanning topography, combined with the orientation of loops A and C and the C terminus, suggests that both loop B and the N-terminal domain are cytosolically oriented. Furthermore, as the hydropathy profile of PEMT is highly conserved in species from Rattus norvegicus toHomo sapiens, the elucidated membrane topography of the human enzyme should prove representative of the higher eukaryotic PEMT family. Recent data from experiments utilizing isotopic labeling and NMR spectroscopy suggest that channeling of metabolites occurs in the PEMT pathway (9Reo N.V. Adinehzadeh M. Foy B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1580: 171-188Google Scholar). Identification of residues essential for binding of the methyl group donor, AdoMet, combined with the current data on the subcellular localization and topographical orientation of PEMT, should provide the clearest insight yet into the specific role of metabolic channeling in this pathway. Approximately 85% of methylation reactions occur in the liver, and AdoMet is the primary methyl group donor (41Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1582-1587Google Scholar, 42Fauman E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 1-32Google Scholar). Although several consensus AdoMet binding motifs have been identified that are conserved in the majority of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, a small fraction of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, including the eukaryotic PEMT family of enzymes, lack these motifs (43Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Google Scholar). Cellular AdoMet is concentrated predominantly in the cytosol, with a smaller fraction present in mitochondria (44Farooqui J.Z. Lee H.W. Kim S. Paik W.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 757: 342-351Google Scholar). Thus, we posit that residues essential for binding of the AdoMet moiety are localized in the cytosolically disposed hydrophilic loop (B) or at the cytosolic face of the transmembrane α-helices. Elucidation of the topographical organization of PEMT should therefore accelerate the identification of residues that are important for binding AdoMet. In summary, we describe the first experimental resolution of the topography of an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of PC. Data from the current studies should provide the impetus for detailed structural analysis of PEMT, which, in turn, should yield evidence for a definitive topographical model of this AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase. Elucidation of the topographical organization of PEMT will enable detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal organization of residues essential for the binding of AdoMet and hence promote a mechanistic understanding of the methylation-dependent biosynthesis of PC.

The aim of the present study was to identify PACAP receptor isoforms and to determine whether PACAP can affect intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and catecholamine secretion. Using primary cultures and specific stimulation of chromaffin cells, we demonstrate that PACAP-38 induced an increase in [Ca2+]i that was blocked by PACAP (6–38), was independent of external Ca2+, and originated from thapsigargin-insensitive internal stores. The PACAP-triggered Ca2+ increase was not affected by inhibition of PLCβ (preincubation with U-73122) or by pretreatment of cells with Xestospongin C, indicating that the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive stores were not mobilized. However, forskolin (FSK), which raises cytosolic cAMP, induced an increase in Ca2+ similar to that recorded with PACAP-38. Blockage of PKA by H-89 or (R p)-cAMPS suppressed both PACAP-38 and FSK calcium responses. The effect of PACAP-38 was also abolished by emptying the caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Furthermore, treatment of cells with orthovanadate (100 μm) impaired Ca2+reloading of PACAP-sensitive stores indicating that PACAP-38 can mobilize Ca2+ from secretory vesicles. Moreover, PACAP induced catecholamine secretion by chromaffin cells. It is concluded that PACAP-38, through the PAC1 receptor, acts as a neurotransmitter in human fetal chromaffin cells inducing catecholamine secretion, through nonclassical, recently described, ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive pools, involving a cAMP- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation mechanism.

Processing of PACAP-38 can generate a 27-amino acid amidated peptide (PACAP-27) that exhibits 68% sequence identity with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), thus identifying PACAP as a member of the VIP/secretin/glucagon superfamily of regulatory peptides (1Arimura A. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1998; 48: 301-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 2Vaudry D. Gonzalez B. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of PACAP are mediated through interaction with two types of high affinity receptors: type I receptors are selectively activated by PACAP, whereas type II receptors bind PACAP and VIP with similar affinity (3Harmar A. Arimura A. Gozes I. Journot L. Laburthe M. Pisegna J. Rawlings S. Robberecht P. Said S. Sreedharan S. Wank S. Waschek J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 265-270PubMed Google Scholar). Three isoforms of PACAP receptors have now been cloned and designated as PACAP-specific receptor I (PAC1-R) (4Ogi K. Miyamoto Y. Masuda Y. Habata Y. Hosoya M. Ohtaki T. Masuo Y. Onda H. Fujino M.

Goossens J., De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Both PAC1-R (type 1 receptors) and VPAC1-R/VPAC2-R (type 2 receptors) belong to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-protein-coupled receptor family, and are all positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase (2Vaudry D. Gonzalez B. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). Eight isoforms of PAC1-R, resulting from alternative splicing, have been characterized to date. These variants display differential signal transduction properties with regard to adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C (PLC) stimulation (1Arimura A. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1998; 48: 301-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 2Vaudry D. Gonzalez B. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these classical signaling pathways, PACAP has been found to stimulate a Ca2+-calmodulin nitric oxide synthase (8Murthy K. Makhlouf G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15977-15980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (9Villalba M. Bockaert J. Journot L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These various transduction mechanisms are involved in the neurotrophic activities exerted by PACAP (i.e. inhibition of apoptosis and stimulation of neurite outgrowth) during development (9Villalba M. Bockaert J. Journot L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gonzalez B. Basille M. Vaudry D. Fournier A. Vaudry H.

A. 1999; 96: 9415-9420Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). PACAP and its receptors are actively expressed in the adrenal medulla (12Tabarin A. Chen D. Hakanson R. Sundler F.

In particular, we have previously demonstrated the occurrence of PACAP-38 (15Breault L. Yon L. Montero M. Chouinard L. Contesse V. Delarue C. Fournier A. Lehoux J.G. Vaudry H. Gallo-Payet N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 921: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and PACAP binding sites (16Yon L. Breault L. Contesse V. Bellancourt G. Delarue C. Fournier A. Lehoux J. Vaudry H. Gallo-Payet N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar) in chromaffin cells from 16- to 20-week-old fetal human adrenal glands. Activation of these receptors by PACAP-38 causes stimulation of cAMP production and induces a modest increase in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) formation (16Yon L. Breault L. Contesse V. Bellancourt G. Delarue C. Fournier A. Lehoux J. Vaudry H. Gallo-Payet N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for the neuropeptide in the developing adrenal gland. During the process of adrenal gland development, pheochromoblasts originating from the neural crest migrate throughout the fetal cortex, acquiring progressive differentiation through contact with the steroidogenic cells (17Michelsohn A. Anderson D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 589-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Ehrhart-Bornstein M. Breidert M. Guadanucci P. Wozniak W. Bocian-Sobkowska J. Malendowicz L.K.

Rev. 1997; 18: 378-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, the neuroendocrine regulation of catecholamine release by chromaffin cells in the human fetus has not been investigated. Although PACAP is known to be a potent activator of catecholamine secretion from rat and porcine adrenochromaffin cells (20Chowdhury P. Guo X. Wakade T. Przywara D. Wakade A. Neuroscience. 1994; 59: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Guo X. Wakade A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 475: 539-545Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the differential coupling of PACAP receptor variants to the various Ca2+ sources and to the adenylyl cyclase and PLC signaling pathways is still poorly understood. In particular, the effect of PACAP on fetal chromaffin cells has never been investigated. The aim of the present study was therefore to identify the PACAP receptor isoforms expressed in the human fetal adrenal gland and to analyze the signaling pathways responsible for PACAP-evoked [Ca2+]iincrease and catecholamine secretion. The chemicals used in the present study were obtained from the following sources: RNAqueousTM-4PCR purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX); dithiothreitol, p(dT)12–18, rRNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT) and DNA ladder fromPromega (Madison, WI); deoxy-NTPs and Taq DNA polymerase from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ); Xestospongin C,U73122, forskolin, thapsigargin, and H-89 from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.

(Sunnyvale, CA). All other chemicals were of A grade purity. Fetal adrenal glands were obtained from fetuses aged 14–20 weeks (post fertilization) at the time of therapeutic abortion. Fetal ages were estimated by foot length and time after menstruation, according to Steeter et al. (23Streeter G. Contr. Embryol. 1920; 11: 143-179Google Scholar). The project was approved by the human subject review committee of our institution. After retrieval, glands were cleansed of fat and processed immediately for cellular or RNA preparation. RNA isolation and complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis: total RNA was isolated from whole human fetal adrenal glands (14, 17, and 20 weeks of gestation), and fetal human brain (18 weeks) using RNAqueousTM-4PCR, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA content and quality were determined photometrically. 5 μg of total RNA was denatured (70 °C, 10 min) and reverse-transcribed in the presence of 200 μmp(dT)12–18 at 42 °C for 50 min in 20 μl of 1× RT buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 37.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) containing: 15 mmdithiothreitol, 200 μm deoxy-NTPs, 25 units of rRNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus RT. Inactivation of the enzyme (70 °C, 10 min) was followed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase PCR to assess the quality of the cDNA template (24Basille M. Vaudry D. Coulouarn Y. Jegou S.

In every PCR experiment, amplification in the absence of cDNA and in the presence of 2 μg of RNA was performed as a control (not shown). Negative controls using cDNA templates from NCI-H295R and Chinese hamster ovary cells were performed (not shown). PCR products (10 μl) were analyzed on 2% (w/v) agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Length of PCR products was estimated using a 100-bp DNA ladder. Identification of the PCR products was confirmed by enzymatic digestion and electrophoresis on 3% (w/v) agarose with a 25-bp DNA ladder (not shown). Experiments were performed with RNA isolated from three different adrenal glands from 14-, 17-, and 20-week-old human fetuses. Three experiments were performed for each age. Glands were processed as described previously (16Yon L. Breault L. Contesse V. Bellancourt G. Delarue C. Fournier A. Lehoux J. Vaudry H. Gallo-Payet N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar). Whole tissues from one or two glands were used for each cell preparation, without separation of fetal zone, neocortex, or chromaffin cells. Briefly, small portions of glands (1–2 mm3) were dissociated with collagenase (2 mg/ml) and DNase (25 μg/ml) in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 2% antibiotics. After three 20-min incubations, cells were dissociated, filtered, and centrifuged for 10 min at 100 × g. The cell pellet was suspended in OPTI-MEM medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and antimycotics. Cells were plated at a density of ∼2 × 105 on plastic coverslips (25 mm). Cells were grown for 3 days in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2, at 37 °C. For dye loading, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the physiological medium OPTI-MEM containing 4 μm of the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4/AM. Hydrolysis was performed for 30 min at 37 °C in a medium containing: 140 mm NaCl; 5.4 mm KCl; 2 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgCl2; 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; and 1 g/liter glucose. The coverslips were then mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The light source was generated by a 100-watt mercury lamp. Band-pass filters (450–490 nm) and (520–560 nm) were used for excitation and emission, respectively. The emitted light was recorded by a photon-counting unit. Calcium calibration was performed as described previously (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, because calcium dye properties may be different in cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic compartments (28Perez-Terzic C. Stehno-Bittel L. Clapham D.E. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), [Ca2+]i should be considered only as semiquantitative data (29Kopp M.D. Schomerus C. Dehghani F. Korf H.W. Meissl H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 206-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An amperometric technique was used to record secretion from chromaffin cells as described previously (30Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A. Kennedy R.T. Kawagoe K.T. Schroeder T.J. Leszczyszyn D.J. Near J.A. Diliberto E.J., Jr. Viveros O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10754-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 5-μm carbon fiber electrode (Ala Scientific Instrument Inc., Westbury, NY) connected to a Patch Clamp PC-501A amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) modified for voltametry was positioned in close proximity of a cell. The potential of the electrode was fixed to 800 mV, and current traces were filtered at 4 kHz and recorded on a DAS-75 digital recorder (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Curves were fitted with SigmaPlot (version 7.0, Chicago, IL). The data are presented as means ± S.E. from the number of experiments indicated in the legends or in the text. Statistical analyses of the data were performed using the one-way analysis of variance test. Homogeneity of variance was assessed by Bartlett's test, and p values were obtained from Dunnett's tables. Using autoradiography, we have previously shown that PACAP receptors in the human fetal adrenal gland were localized only on chromaffin cells (16Yon L. Breault L. Contesse V. Bellancourt G. Delarue C. Fournier A. Lehoux J. Vaudry H. Gallo-Payet N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar). An RT-PCR approach was used to identify the PACAP receptor subtypes expressed in adrenal glands from 14- to 20-week-old fetuses. As indicated under “Materials and Methods,” PAC1-R splice variants were discriminated using primers flanking the insertion site of the 84-bp cassettes. As shown in Fig. 1 A, two bands were detected: a 303-bp band corresponding to the short form of the receptor and a 387-bp band corresponding to an isoform containing a single insertion cassette. Amplicons of 324 and 380 bp corresponding, respectively, to VPAC1-R and VPAC2-R sequences were also detected in all fetal adrenal glands. However, based on our previous results, these receptors have a more diffuse distribution throughout the adrenal gland, whereas PAC1-Rs are only detected in chromaffin cells (16Yon L. Breault L. Contesse V. Bellancourt G. Delarue C. Fournier A. Lehoux J. Vaudry H. Gallo-Payet N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the PAC1-R, VPAC1-R, and VPAC2-R RNAs was also observed in 18-week-old fetal brains. Amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fig. 1 D) confirmed that cDNA was present in each reaction. Chromaffin cells, which gather into small clusters with numerous processes, could be easily distinguished from the large individual fetal steroidogenic cells (Fig. 2, white arrows). Measurements of [Ca2+]i were performed on peripheral cells of the clusters, selected by a pinhole placed in the optical path (Fig. 2,asterisk). Mean [Ca2+]i in chromaffin cells incubated in medium containing 2 mm Ca2+was 77 nm ± 7 (n = 6) in resting conditions. Application of 1 × 10−9mPACAP-38 induced a transient elevation of [Ca2+]i(Fig. 3 A). This [Ca2+]i increase was characterized by a rapid upstroke followed by a slower decrease to basal levels. The time course of the decrease could be fitted by a monoexponential function. At a concentration of 1 × 10−9m PACAP-38, the time constant τ was 57.3 ± 7.4 s (n = 9). In Ca2+-free medium (0 Ca2+ plus 1 mmEGTA), application of 1 × 10−9mPACAP-38 provoked an increase in [Ca2+]i similar to that recorded in 2 mm Ca2+-containing medium (Fig. 3 B) with a time constant (49.7 ± 3.5 s; n = 11) that was not significantly different (p = 0.34), suggesting that PACAP-38 causes mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Indeed, application of Ni2+, a known Ca2+channel blocker, during the decreasing phase of the Ca2+response, had no effect on the kinetics of the Ca2+ spike induced by application of PACAP-38 (1 × 10−9m) in 2 mm Ca2+-containing medium, whereas a second application of PACAP-38 in the presence of Ni2+ provoked a Ca2+ response similar to that obtained in the absence of the blocker (Fig. 3 C). Application of increasing concentrations of PACAP-38 resulted in a dose-dependent rise in the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i response with an ED50 value of 5 nm (Fig. 3 D), a value similar to that obtained (2.6 nm) by measuring the [Ca2+]i increase on hippocampal neurons (31Tatsuno I. Yada T. Vigh S. Hidaka H. Arimura A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Administration of repeated pulses of PACAP-38 (1 × 10−9m) at various time intervals induced a reproducible [Ca2+]i increase, even when applied at very short intervals (Fig. 4 A). The amplitudes of the responses to any of the four pulses applied were not significantly different (Fig. 4 B). To further confirm that the PACAP-induced [Ca2+]i increase was due to the activation of the PAC1-R type receptor, we used PACAP (6–38), a PAC1 receptor-specific antagonist shown to inhibit the activation of adenylyl cyclase with a K iof 7 nm (32Robberecht P. Gourlet P., De Neef P. Woussen-Colle M.C. Vandermeers-Piret M.C. Vandermeers A. Christophe J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 347-355PubMed Google Scholar). A first application of PACAP-38 (1 × 10−7m) triggered a Ca2+ response as previously described. The antagonist PACAP (6–38) was then applied (10 μm) for a 10-min period and followed by a second application of PACAP-38, at the same concentration, which induced a lower Ca2+ increase (Fig. 4 C). For concentrations of PACAP (6–38) of 0.3, 1, and 10 μm, the Ca2+ response to PACAP-38 (1 × 10−7m) was reduced to 48.5 ± 12% (n = 4), 25 ± 2% (n = 2), and 6.9 ± 3.4% (n = 4) of the control, respectively (Fig. 4 D).Figure 3Effects of PACAP-38 on [Ca2+]i in human fetal chromaffin cells.

C, application of Ni2+ (500 μm) during the falling phase of the Ca2+ response induced by PACAP-38 (P) 1 × 10−9m had no effect on the time course of the response nor on the subsequent response induced by a new application of PACAP-38 (representative of 5 cells from 5 different cell cultures).

Breault L. Contesse V. Bellancourt G. Delarue C. Fournier A. Lehoux J. Vaudry H. Gallo-Payet N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we first investigated whether or not the PACAP-sensitive Ca2+ pool was responsive to thapsigargin (TG), a known inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pumps but without effect on plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity (33Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In one series of experiments, the cells were bathed in Ca2+-free medium. Application of PACAP-38 (1 × 10−9m) produced an increase in Ca2+ as described previously (Fig. 5 A). The subsequent application of TG (4 μm) triggered an additional increase in [Ca2+]i resulting from blockage of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pumps. When PACAP-38 was applied further, the amplitude and kinetics of the Ca2+ increase were similar to those obtained prior to TG application, indicating that TG and PACAP-38 did not mobilize the same Ca2+ pool(s). In a second series of experiments, cells were preincubated for 30 min in a calcium-free medium containing 8 μm TG. Under these conditions, the Ca2+response to TG (4 μm) was greatly reduced, whereas the response to PACAP-38 (2.5 × 10−9m) was not affected (Fig. 5 B). In some other cell types, it has been shown that PACAP receptors are coupled to PLC through a Gq/11 protein to produce diacylglycerol and IP3 (34Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). In the specific case of human fetal chromaffin cells, we previously found that IP3production is relatively low (16Yon L. Breault L. Contesse V. Bellancourt G. Delarue C. Fournier A. Lehoux J. Vaudry H. Gallo-Payet N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, experiments were performed to assess the putative role of IP3-sensitive calcium pools in the PACAP-induced i"

To study factors that might influence triplex formation at chromosomal sites in mammalian cells, we developed a restriction protection assay to detect triplex-directed psoralen crosslinks in genomic DNA prepared from TFO-transfected cells. Using this assay, we detected binding of a G-rich TFO to a chromosomal site even in the absence of transcription when high concentrations of the TFO were used for transfection. However, experimental induction of transcription at the target site, via an ecdysone-responsive promoter, resulted in substantial increases (3-fold or more) in target site crosslinking, especially at low TFO concentrations. When RNA polymerase activity was inhibited, even in the ecdysone-induced cells, the level of TFO binding was significantly decreased, indicating that transcription through the target region, and not just transcription factor binding, is necessary for the enhanced chromosomal targeting by TFOs. These findings provide evidence that physiologic activity at a chromosomal target site can influence its accessibility to TFOs and suggest that gene targeting by small molecules may be most effective at highly expressed chromosomal loci.

Specificity arises from the formation of Hoogsteen or reverse-Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds between the bases of the pyrimidine or purine TFO and the bases of the purine strand of the duplex (1Moser H.E.

Macris M.A. Faruqi A.F. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9003-9008Google Scholar). The ability of TFOs to induce mutagenesis is relatively efficient when they are allowed to bind to their target in plasmid DNA in vitro prior to the transfection of cells (19Havre P.A. Glazer P.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7324-7331Google Scholar), but the effect of the TFO is diminished when intracellular binding is required (18Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Google Scholar). Thein vivo efficacy of TFOs is potentially limited by multiple factors in the cellular environment. For example, the presence of single-strand nucleases can lead to rapid degradation of oligonucleotides if the 3′-end is not protected (31Agrawal S. Temsamani J. Tang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7595-7599Google Scholar). The neutral pH inside cells is suboptimal for triplex formation by pyrimidine TFOs because of the requirement for protonation of cytosine at the N3 position (32Singleton S.F. Dervan P.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10995-11003Google Scholar), and high potassium levels inhibit purine motif triplex formation (33Cheng A.J. Van Dyke M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5630-5635Google Scholar, 34Olivas W.M. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1936-1941Google Scholar, 35Vasquez K.M. Wensel T.G. Hogan M.E. Wilson J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7243-7251Google Scholar). An additional limiting factor may be the competition with DNA-binding proteins. Because of the complex structure into which chromosomal DNA is packaged by histones and other proteins, there has been substantial debate in the field as to whether chromosomal DNA would be accessible to TFOs. In studies conducted in vitro, triplexes did not form on DNA sequences already organized into nucleosomes (36Westin L. Blomquist P. Milligan J.F. Wrange O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2184-2191Google Scholar, 37Espinas M.L. Jimenez-Garcia E. Martinez-Balbas A. Azorin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31807-31812Google Scholar) except at sites located toward the ends of nucleosomal DNA fragments (38Brown P.M. Madden C.A. Fox K.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16139-16151Google Scholar). Conversely, pre-formed triplexes blocked nucleosome formation on DNA fragments in vitro (36Westin L. Blomquist P. Milligan J.F. Wrange O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2184-2191Google Scholar, 37Espinas M.L. Jimenez-Garcia E. Martinez-Balbas A. Azorin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31807-31812Google Scholar). In Xenopusoocytes, Bailey and Weeks (39Bailey C. Weeks D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1154-1161Google Scholar) found that a specific TFO could inhibit reporter gene expression on a chromatinized plasmid only when multiple target sites were introduced into the promoter region in a pattern designed so that not all of the sites could be simultaneously bound by a histone octamer. Together, these studies suggested that nucleosome formation and TFO-mediated triplex formation may be competing processes. Despite these studies, several lines of evidence support the ability of TFOs to target chromosomal sites. TFOs have been shown to induce site-specific chromosomal mutagenesis both in yeast (24Barre F.X. Ait-Si-Ali S. Giovannangeli C. Luis R. Robin P. Pritchard L.L. Helene C. Harel-Bellan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3084-3088Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (22Vasquez K.M. Wang G. Havre P.A. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1176-1181Google Scholar, 23Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.L. Powell J. Liu J. Fei Z. Khripine Y. Watanabe K.A. George J. Glazer P.M. Seidman M.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 212-214Google Scholar) and even in mouse tissues following systemic administration of TFOs in mice (25Vasquez K.M. Narayanan L. Glazer P.M. Science. 2000; 290: 530-533Google Scholar). Other studies have reported direct demonstrations of triplex formation on chromosomal targets using a number of methods for physical detection, including restriction protection, ligation-mediated PCR, and primer extension (40Guieysse A.L. Praseuth D. Grigoriev M. Harel-Bellan A. Helene C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4210-4216Google Scholar, 41Giovannangeli C. Diviacco S. Labrousse V. Gryaznov S. Charneau P. Helene C. Proc. Natl.

However, some questions have been raised about possible artifacts in certain detection assays (44Becker N.A. Maher L.J. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1999; 9: 313-316Google Scholar). In particular, Becker and Maher (44Becker N.A. Maher L.J. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1999; 9: 313-316Google Scholar) showed that unbound oligonucleotides present in cells could persist following cell lysis and thereby influence the apparent detection ofin vivo formed triplexes in a ligation-mediated PCR assay (44Becker N.A. Maher L.J. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1999; 9: 313-316Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the apparent discrepancies between the in vitro and in vivo studies of triplex formation on chromatinized targets may reflect the dynamic nature of chromatin structure in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we set out to examine the effect of transcription on triplex formation in vivo based on the concept that transcription is a key factor in altering chromatin structure in living cells. Here, we report the development of an assay to detect triplex formation at a chromosomal site in mammalian cells. The assay depends on resistance to restriction enzyme cleavage at the target site conferred by triple helix-directed psoralen crosslinks. Using this assay, we tested the effect of transcription on TFO binding at a chromosomal site where transcription can be specifically regulated by hormone treatment to activate a specialized transcription factor. We show here that transcriptional activity at a chromosomal site can substantially influence the accessibility of that site to binding by a TFO, especially at low TFO concentrations. In addition, even in hormone-treated cells when RNA polymerase activity is poisoned by α-amanitin treatment, TFO targeting is reduced, further demonstrating a direct effect of transcription, and not just transcription factor binding, on the targeting of chromosomal sites by TFOs. Psoralen-conjugated oligonucleotides were synthesized by either Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) or Oligos, Etc. (Wilsonville, OR) and were gel or high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) purified as described previously (22Vasquez K.M. Wang G. Havre P.A. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1176-1181Google Scholar). These oligonucleotides were synthesized with a propylamine group (Glen Research) on the 3′-end to prevent degradation by nucleases (45Zendegui J.G. Vasquez K.M. Tinsley J.H. Kessler D.J. Hogan M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 307-314Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for cloning were synthesized at the Keck Facility (Yale University). Their sequences are the following: MM1 (5′-CTA GGA TCC TTC CCC CCC CTC CTC CCC CTC CCC CTC-3′) and MM2 (5′-AGC TGA GGG GGA GGG GGA GGA GGG GGG GGA AGG ATC-3′). Plasmid pMM2 was derived from pIND/LacZ (Invitrogen) and was constructed to contain a G:C bp-rich site amenable to triplex formation in the purine motif. The polypurine duplex target site was created by annealing oligonucleotides MM1 and MM2. These oligonucleotides were engineered to contain aBamHI restriction site overlapping the polypurine sequence at one end. pMM2 was generated by cloning the synthetic duplex into theHindIII site within the inducible expression cassette in pIND/LacZ. Cells in which transcription at the TFO binding site could be manipulated were generated by transfecting ECR-293 cells (Invitrogen), which stably express the hormone-responsive ecdysone receptor heterodimer, with ScaI-linearized pMM2 plasmid DNA using GenePORTER reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Stable clones with chromosomally integrated pMM2 DNA were selected by colony formation upon 2 weeks of growth in selective medium consisting of high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 400 μg/ml zeocin, and 400 μg/ml G418. One resulting cell line, EC293-6, was chosen for further study. In this cell line, stable chromosomal integration of the pMM2 DNA was confirmed by genomic Southern analysis. The target sequence remained stably integrated in the genome of EC293-6 cells in culture for several months as determined by genomic Southern analysis (data not shown). Transcription at the target locus was specifically induced by treatment of the cells with the ecdysone analog, ponasterone A. Ponasterone A was dissolved in 95% ethanol at a concentration of 1 mm and added to the growth media of EC293-6 cells at a final concentration of 5 μm. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 h, extracts were prepared, and induced β-galactosidase activity was detected using the Galacto-Star chemiluminescent assay (TROPIX, Inc., Bedford, MA). A luminometer was used to measure light signal output. For direct visualization following induction with 5 μm ponasterone for 20 h at 37 °C, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, and stained with 20 mm potassium ferricyanide, 20 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mmMgCl2, and 0.5 mg/ml X-gal in PBS. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the cells were visualized by light microscopy. To inhibit transcription, α-amanitin was dissolved in water at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and added to the growth media of EC293-6 cells at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. If cells were exposed to α-amanitin and ponasterone, ponasterone was added 12 h after α-amanitin addition. Cells were transfected by permeabilization with digitonin as described by Giovannangeli et al. (41Giovannangeli C. Diviacco S. Labrousse V. Gryaznov S. Charneau P. Helene C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 79-84Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides, either pso-AG30 or pso-SCR30, were added to the digitonin-permeabilized cells at final concentrations of 0–20 μm. Following a 1.5 h incubation of the cells at 37 °C in suspension, the cells were irradiated with long wavelength UV light (UVA; using a broad band UVA light source (320–400 nm, centered at 365 nm; Southern New England Ultraviolet, Branford, CT) as described previously in Ref. 46Havre P.A. Gunther E.J. Gasparro F.P. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7879-7883Google Scholar) for psoralen photoactivation to crosslink bound psoralen-TFOs to the chromosomal DNA. The irradiation took place over 6 min, corresponding to a total dose of 1.8 J/cm2. UVA doses were determined by radiometry (International Light, Newburyport, MA), as described previously (46Havre P.A. Gunther E.J. Gasparro F.P. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7879-7883Google Scholar). Immediately following UVA irradiation, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS), heated to 60 °C for 15 min, and treated with proteinase K at a concentration of 100 μg/ml overnight at 37 °C. Lysates were extracted once with phenol (equilibrated with Tris) and twice with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The DNA was ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 100 mm KCl. Once in solution, genomic DNA samples were incubated at 60 °C for 2 h to disrupt non-covalent triplexes. Unbound and un-crosslinked oligonucleotides were removed by filtration through a Centricon-100 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Following lysis and specialized sample preparation as above, genomic DNA from EC293-6 cells was digested with BglII, EcoRI, andBamHI and analyzed by Southern blotting. The 3.1-kbHindIII/EcoRI fragment of pIND/LacZ (Invitrogen) was used as a probe. Band intensities were quantified by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To study the effect of transcription on triplex formation, we created a cell line in which we could manipulate transcription at the TFO target site in genomic DNA. Human 293 cells, previously engineered to express the ecdysone receptor heterodimer, were stably transfected with a linearized vector (pMM2), containing a target site for TFO binding downstream of an ecdysone-inducible promoter and upstream of a lacZ reporter gene (Fig. 1 A), and stable clones with the vector sequence integrated within a chromosomal locus were selected by long term growth in G418. One cell line, EC293-6, was selected for further study, and chromosomal integration of the vector DNA was confirmed by genomic Southern analysis (data not shown). In the EC293-6 cells, it was also confirmed that transcription across the TFO target site could be specifically induced by treatment of the cells with ponasterone, an ecdysone analog. Ponasterone binds to the ecdysone receptor heterodimer in the cells, and this causes the receptor to bind to the ecdysone response element situated upstream of the Phsp minimal promoter, the TFO target site, and the β-galactosidase coding region (in that order), thereby activating transcription downstream. We measured β-galactosidase activity in these cells before and after induction with ponasterone. There was very little β-galactosidase expression in uninduced cells, but β-galactosidase expression was induced ∼250-fold above background in cells exposed to 5 μm ponasterone for 20 h (Fig. 1 B). Direct staining revealed that expression was induced in almost all of the cells (Fig. 1 C). Hence, transcription across the TFO target site could be specifically induced by ponasterone treatment of the EC293-6 cells. In previous work, we had found that the 30-nucleotide, G-rich TFO, AG30, could mediate site-directed mutagenesis and recombination in thesupFG1 reporter gene in chromosomal DNA in mammalian cells and mice (22Vasquez K.M. Wang G. Havre P.A. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1176-1181Google Scholar, 25Vasquez K.M. Narayanan L. Glazer P.M. Science. 2000; 290: 530-533Google Scholar, 30Luo Z. Macris M.A. Faruqi A.F. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9003-9008Google Scholar). We therefore chose the 30-bp supFG1polypurine site as a suitable target sequence to test the influence of transcription on TFO binding. As explained above, the inducible expression cassette in the EC293-6 cells was designed to contain this 30-bp target site at the position indicated in Fig. 1 A so that transcription induced by ponasterone would occur through the 30-bp site. In addition, the site was designed to overlap a BamHI restriction site at one end. In this arrangement, triple helix formation by the 5′-psoralen-conjugated TFO, pso-AG30, would be expected to position the psoralen for photoreaction at the 5′ ApT 3′-sequence within the BamHI recognition site (Fig. 1 D). Because triplex-directed psoralen adducts have been shown to block restriction enzyme cleavage if the adduct is formed within the recognition site (41Giovannangeli C. Diviacco S. Labrousse V. Gryaznov S. Charneau P. Helene C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 79-84Google Scholar, 47Gunther E.J. Havre P.A. Gasparro F.P. Glazer P.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 207-212Google Scholar), we used this substrate as the basis for an assay to directly measure intracellular triplex formation. We expected that triplex-directed psoralen adducts could be measured by the extent of BamHI resistance at the target site in a quantitative genomic Southern blot analysis. However, we were concerned that unbound or un-crosslinked TFOs present in cell lysates might bind to the genomic DNA in vitro after lysis and so influence the apparent detection of in vivoformed triplexes in the restriction protection assay. We therefore developed a genomic DNA purification procedure to eliminate unbound oligonucleotides and disrupt non-covalent triplexes, thereby allowing persistence only of covalent psoralen third strand adducts in the genomic DNA. To achieve this, the genomic DNA samples were incubated in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm KCl at 60 °C for 2 h, and unbound and un-crosslinked oligonucleotides were removed via size filtration prior to restriction digestion. Under these conditions, triplex formation is inhibited because EDTA chelates Mg2+, which is important for stabilizing triple helices via charge neutralization, and the high concentration of K+ favors the self-aggregation of the G-rich TFO. In addition, non-covalent triplexes formed by AG30 melt at 60 °C while duplexes remain intact, and the size filtration separates the free oligonucleotides from the genomic DNA. This approach was tested and validated via a series of in vitroexperiments on defined DNA samples (data not shown). To study the influence of transcription on TFO binding at the chromosomal site in EC293-6 cells, the cells were either treated or not with ponasterone to induce transcription at the TFO target site. They were subsequently transfected with selected oligonucleotides at a concentration of 20 μm via permeabilization with digitonin to achieve high levels of intracellular delivery. The oligonucleotides included either pso-AG30 or a control oligonucleotide, pso-SCR30, which has the same base composition as pso-AG30 but possesses a scrambled sequence creating 12 mismatches so that it is not capable of binding to the target site as a third strand (Fig. 1 D and Ref. 22Vasquez K.M. Wang G. Havre P.A. Glazer P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1176-1181Google Scholar). One and a half hours after transfection, the cells were irradiated with long wavelength UV light. A total UVA dose of 1.8 J/cm2 was given over a period of 6 min to fix the bound TFO to its binding site via photoactivation of the psoralen moiety. Immediately following UVA irradiation, the cells were lysed for preparation of genomic DNA using the protocol described above. The genomic DNA was digested with BglII, BamHI, andEcoRI, and the samples were analyzed by Southern blotting using a probe spanning the lacZ gene (Fig. 2). The appearance of a 3.6-kb fragment indicates inhibition of BamHI cleavage due to TFO-directed psoralen crosslinks at the overlapping site. In the absence of crosslinks at that site, 3.1- and 0.5-kb fragments are produced (Fig. 1 D). A 3.6-kb protected fragment is seen in samples from cells incubated with pso-AG30 and UVA irradiated (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3 and 8), suggesting that intracellular triplex formation can be detected at the target chromosomal site. Only the specific TFO, pso-AG30, and not the control oligonucleotide, pso-SCR30, produced site-specific adducts to inhibit BamHI cleavage at the target site (compare Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 8 with lanes 5 and 10). The inhibition of BamHI cleavage must be due to target site crosslinking in cells rather than binding of pso-AG30 in vitro after lysis of the cells, because the 3.6-kb fragment is absent in samples from cells transfected with pso-AG30 but not UVA irradiated (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and7). This experiment was repeated three times, and a representative gel is shown. The intensities of bands corresponding to the protected and unprotected fragments were quantified for each sample using a PhosphorImager. The ratio of radioactive signal detected in the protected band to total signal for both the 3.6- and 3.1-kb bands provides an estimate of the extent of target site crosslinking, and standard errors were calculated for the percentage crosslinking values. Substantial binding (about 10%) was detected in the absence of induced transcription, so even minimally or untranscribed regions can be accessible to triplex formation, at least at high concentrations of transfected TFOs (20 μm). Importantly, however, this analysis revealed a 3-fold increase in target site crosslinking by pso-AG30 when transcription was specifically induced at the target site (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that transcriptional activity at a chromosomal site substantially influences the accessibility of that site to oligonucleotide-mediated triplex formation. The experiment was repeated using varying concentrations of pso-AG30 and quantified as above to determine the dose dependence of TFO binding at the target site with or without induction of transcription. As the concentration of pso-AG30 used to transfect EC293-6 cells was increased from 0.2 to 20 μm, we detected an increase in the abundance of the 3.6-kb protected fragment relative to the 3.1-kb unprotected fragment in both ponasterone-induced and -uninduced samples (Fig. 3). These data provide further evidence that inhibition of BamHI cleavage is in fact TFO dependent. These results are also quantitatively consistent with the above experiments, as we saw a ∼3-fold increase in target site crosslinking in DNA samples from cells in which transcription was induced at the target site relative to DNA from uninduced cells when we used a 20 μm dose of pso-AG30 (Fig. 3). However, when cells were transfected with pso-AG30 at a concentration of 10 μm, the level of targeting was almost 10-fold higher in the ponasterone-induced cells than in the uninduced cells. At a 2 μm concentration of pso-AG30, we still detected substantial TFO-mediated crosslinking in DNA from cells in which transcription was induced at the target site (about 10%), but target site crosslinking was less than 1% in DNA from uninduced cells (Fig. 3). These results indicate that at lower concentrations of oligonucleotide, transcription-modulated accessibility of a chromosomal site to TFO binding is of increased importance. To further study the influence of transcription on TFO binding, we conducted experiments to determine the relative contributions to chromosomal accessibility of transcription through the target site versus transcription factor binding nearby the site alone. To do this, we used α-amanitin, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, to block transcription through the target region even when the ecdysone receptor was activated by ponasterone and capable of binding to the response element. We first evaluated the effect of α-amanitin on expression at the target locus. EC293-6 cells were treated with ponasterone, α-amanitin, or both, and β-galactosidase activity was measured in cell extracts. β-galactosidase activity in the untreated EC293-6 cells (Fig. 4 A) was similar to the background level (4.9 × 104 relative light units by this scale) in the parental cell line ECR-293, which does not contain the β-galactosidase expression cassette. As above, ponasterone treatment stimulated high levels of lacZexpression in the EC293-6 cells. However, when α-amanitin was present in either ponasterone-treated or -untreated cells, lacZexpression was prevented and in the range of background (Fig. 4 A). In parallel samples exposed to the same combinations of ponasterone and α-amanitin, EC293-6 cells were transfected with pso-AG30 at a concentration of 20 μm and UVA irradiated 1.5 h later. The genomic DNA was purified, and target site crosslinking was analyzed by Southern blotting and quantified as above (Fig. 4 B). We found that α-amanitin treatment of the cells led to substantially reduced TFO binding even when ponasterone was added, indicating that transcription through the target region (and not just hormone-induced transcription factor binding) is important for the enhanced chromosomal site targeting by TFOs (Fig. 4 B). However, we still detected some (∼10%) target site crosslinking in samples from cells treated with both α-amanitin and ponasterone. In comparison, less crosslinking was seen in cells treated with α-amanitin in the absence of ponasterone (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, it is possible that transcription factor binding, by itself, may alter local chromatin structure to some degree to facilitate TFO binding at nearby sites. In the comparison of samples from cells not treated with ponasterone, α-amanitin by itself was found to reduce even the baseline level of TFO binding (Fig. 4 B). This reduction in TFO binding may reflect effects on chromatin accessibility that are exerted at a distance because of transcription suppression at flanking loci. We have developed a restriction protection assay to physically detect triple helix-directed psoralen crosslinks at a chromosomal site in mammalian cells. We found that such an assay can be prone to artifacts due to the persistence of un-crosslinked oligonucleotide in cell lysates (data not shown), but the artifacts were eliminated by modifying the DNA purification procedure. Using the modified protocol, we provided direct evidence that the TFO, pso-AG30, could bind to a chromosomal target site in human cells even in the absence of transcription, with the degree of binding dependent on TFO dose. When transcription was specifically induced at the target site, however, we measured substantial increases in target site binding over a range of TFO concentrations. However, the differential effect of transcription on binding was greatest at the lower concentrations of the TFO. By using α-amanitin to inhibit RNA polymerase II in the cells, we further demonstrated that transcription through the target region, in particular, plays a major role in the enhanced chromosomal targeting by TFOs. However, transcription factor binding appeared to moderately influence accessibility, perhaps via localized effects on chromatin structure. In addition, a modest effect on accessibility due to overall cellular transcriptional activity could be inferred from the effect of α-amanitin on the cells not treated with ponasterone. This effect may reflect the ability of transcription at nearby sites to alter chromatin structure or DNA topology at the target site, although altered expression of a putative chromatin accessibility factor could be another explanation. DNA within the eukaryotic nucleus is organized and packaged into chromatin by association with histone proteins. Nucleosomes are the fundamental units of chromatin and consist of 146 base pairs of DNA wound around an octamer of histone proteins, which includes two molecules each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Because there are 10 bases per turn of the DNA helix, at least some portion of the 30-base pair AG30 target sequence would be on the inner face of the helix, which is in contact with the histone octamer, possibly rendering it inaccessible to TFO binding. Surprisingly, we detected 10% target site crosslinking by pso-AG30 at the chromosomal locus even in the absence of transcription, so chromatin structure in the basal state is not an absolute barrier to triplex formation in vivo if a sufficient concentration of oligonucleotide is present in the cell. However, chromatin structure is dynamic in vivo due to cellular processes such as transcription, replication, repair, and recombination. We found that the accessibility of a chromosomal site to TFOs can increase at least 3-fold when transcription is specifically induced at that site. The increase in binding at the transcribed site was even greater when the TFO concentration was low. Because intracellular delivery is a major limiting factor in the use of oligonucleotides for genetic manipulation (48Gewirtz A.M. Stein C.A. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3161-3163Google Scholar), we elected to use a specialized method of transfection (digitonin permeabilization) to maximize cellular uptake of oligonucleotides for our experiments. Because other methods of transfection typically yield lower intracellular oligonucleotide concentrations, transcription may be an especially important determinant of TFO targeting efficiency when such alternative methods are used. Some previous studies were interpreted to suggest that there is no difference in chromosomal binding of TFOs based on transcription (41Giovannangeli C. Diviacco S. Labrousse V. Gryaznov S. Charneau P. Helene C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 79-84Google Scholar,43Oh D.H. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4734-4742Google Scholar). However, these studies tested the effects of agents thought to have global effects on transcription and did not directly measure transcriptional activity at the specific target loci. Because the regions examined in the previous studies were downstream of active promoters, it is possible that basal transcriptional activity was already relatively high at these other target sites. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that at sufficient TFO concentrations, triplex formation is possible in mammalian cells even at non-transcribed chromosomal loci. Therefore, even unexpressed or minimally expressed genes or intergenic regions may be targets for gene modification by TFOs. However, transcription at a chromosomal site does substantially increase its accessibility to TFOs, especially at lower TFO doses, and so TFO-mediated gene targeting may be most effective when transcriptional activity at the target region is high.

Although T1 achieves its quaternary structure in the ER, nothing is known about its acquisition of tertiary structure.

Among this class of channels are voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv),1 which open and close in response to changes of membrane potential. Kv channels are formed by four subunits that surround the central permeation pathway. The monomeric Kv subunits assemble as tetrameric species in the ER membrane (1Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol.

Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This self-association occurs between folded T1 monomers (9Lu J. Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Kobertz W.R. Williams C. Miller C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10347-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), giving rise to intersubunit interfaces that contain ∼20 side chains that are involved in polar intersubunit interactions (14Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Stevens C.F. Choe S. Nature. 1998; 392: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As is common for oligomeric proteins, the tertiary structure of individual subunits confers the proper interface for quaternary structure formation. Therefore, the aforementioned polar side chains are only in close proximity when the monomer is folded. In this study, we focus on two biogenic events: folding of the T1 domain in the monomer and tetramerization of T1 domains. These two events must occur over the time frame of biogenesis. Folding into the tertiary structure could occur as soon as the T1 domain exits the ribosome tunnel into the cytosol, and tetramerization of T1 domains may be complete before Kv channels exit the ER membrane. The ability of T1 to form tetramers (tetramerization competence) could also begin when the nascent peptide first emerges from the ribosome. The interplay between T1 folding and tetramerization has not been explored, largely because of the unavailability of a folding assay. Previously, we suggested that ER membranes facilitate T1-T1 association in Kv1.3 (9Lu J. Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a feature that could underlie efficient ER assembly of oligomeric Kv channels. However, we do not know whether the ER membrane assists the T1 monomer folding to form a tetramerization-competent species or whether the monomer is already folded and tetramerization-competent before it reaches the ER membrane. Moreover, we do not know how completely folded the T1 domain is at any specific biogenic stage. Presumably, the tertiary structure of the T1 crystal structure represents one mature conformation. To address these issues and directly study the folding of individual monomeric T1 domains, we have developed a biochemical microassay of formation of the folded intramolecular interface of monomeric Kv1.3. This assay is independent of a measurement of tetramer formation and uses 1) bismaleimides to cross-link pairs of cysteines engineered into an internally folded interface of the monomeric T1 domain and 2) a gel shift strategy that extends current pegylation techniques (16Lu J. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13288-13301Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This approach allows us to detect intramolecularly cross-linked Kv1.3 monomers. Specifically, we have introduced pairs of cysteines into the T1 Kv1.3 monomer, based on the crystal structure of the virtually identical T1 in Kv1.1a (14Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Stevens C.F. Choe S. Nature. 1998; 392: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To study protein folding at different stages of biogenesis, we have generated biogenic intermediates that remain attached to the ribosome. Our results demonstrate that T1 begins to fold prior to arrival of the nascent peptide at the ER membrane and that a point mutation reported to disrupt T1 tetramerization (15Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and channel function has its primary effect at the oligomerization, not folding, stage. Standard methods of plasmid DNA preparation, restriction enzyme analysis, agarose gel electrophoresis, and bacterial transformation were used. The nucleotide sequences of all mutants were confirmed by automated cycle sequencing performed by the DNA Sequencing Facility at the School of Medicine on an ABI 377 sequencer using Big dye terminator chemistry (ABI). All mutant DNAs were sequenced throughout the entire coding region. Engineered cysteines were introduced into pSP/Kv1.3/cysteine-free (9Lu J. Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Cysteine pairs were designed according to their proximity in the previously published crystal structure of T1 (14Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Stevens C.F. Choe S. Nature. 1998; 392: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows three such pairs. Capped cRNA was synthesized in vitro from linearized templates using Sp6 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Linearized templates for Kv1.3 translocation intermediates were generated using KpnI or BstEII enzyme digestion to produce NH2 terminus-S1-S2-S3 (last amino acid is Gly292) or NH2terminus-S1-S2-S3-S4-S5 (last amino acid is Val387), respectively. Proteins were translated in vitro with [35S]methionine (2 μl/25 μl translation mixture; ∼10 μCi/μl Express; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h at 22 °C in the presence of canine microsomal membranes and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (2 mm final [DTT]) according to thePromega Protocol and Application Guide. Electrophoresis was performed using the NuPAGE system and precast Bis-Tris 10% or 4–12% gels and MOPS running buffer. Gels were soaked in Amplify (AmershamBiosciences) to enhance 35S fluorography, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at −70 °C. Typical exposure times were 16–30 h. Quantitation of gels was carried out directly using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), which is very sensitive and detects cpm that are not necessarily visualized in autoradiograms exposed for 16–30 h. Oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis females (Xenopus I, Michigan) as described previously (17Chahine M. Chen L.-Q. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Horn R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1992; 24: 1231-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Stage V–VI oocytes were selected and microinjected with ∼0.1 ng of cRNA encoding for wild-type or mutant Kv1.3. K+ currents from cRNA-injected oocytes were measured by two-microelectrode voltage clamping using a OC-725C oocyte clamp (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) after 24–48 h, at which time currents at +50 mV were 2–10 μA. Electrodes (<1 MΩ) contained 3 m KCl. The currents were filtered at 1 kHz. The bath Ringer solution contained 116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHepes (pH 7.6). The holding potential was −100 mV. For experiments in which inactivation kinetics were determined, we fit the data at +50 mV using the simplex algorithm (Clampfit; Axon Instruments). Activation and inactivation time constants are reported as mean ± S.E. Translation reaction (10–20 μl) was added to 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; calcium- and magnesium-free, pH 7.3, containing 2 mmdithiothreitol). The suspension was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm and 4 °C for 7 min (or 70,000 rpm, 15 min, and 4 °C for Kv1.3 translated in the absence of membranes), through a sucrose cushion (120 μl, containing 0.5 m sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). The pellet was resuspended in 50–500 μl of PBS. 0.5 mm ortho-phenyldimaleimide (PDM; Sigma) was added to those samples to be labeled while a control sample was treated identically but in the absence of PDM, at ∼0 °C for 1 h. No reducing agent is present in these incubations. Samples containing PDM were quenched with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 10 min. Control samples, untreated with PDM, were treated identically. A third sample was labeled with PDM but reserved for treatment with methoxy-polyethylene thiol (PEG-SH). Thiol-reducing agents must be avoided once PDM labels the protein; otherwise, free maleimides will be modified, and further assay with PEG-SH will be blocked. All samples were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm and 4 °C for 7 min, resuspended in 50 μl of PBS containing 1% SDS, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For membrane-free preparations, samples were centrifuged at 70,000 rpm, 4 °C, for 15 min. Those samples designated for pegylation with methoxy-polyethylene glycol maleimide (PEG-MAL; M r 5000; Shearwater, Inc.) were treated with 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol to prevent oxidation, which inhibits pegylation. Samples destined for pegylation with PEG-SH (M r5000; Shearwater, Inc.) received 50 μl of PBS containing only 1% SDS. All SDS-treated samples were diluted with either 50 μl of PBS containing PEG-MAL to give a final concentration of PEG-MAL of 20 mm and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 50 μl of PBS containing PEG-SH to give a final concentration of 20 mm PEG-SH. The pegylation reaction reached steady state by 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, and the PDM reaction reached steady state by 30 min. For any given construct, radioactive protein incubated with PEG-MAL or PEG-SH was detected as distinct bands on NuPAGE gels and quantified using phosphorimaging. The data were analyzed as follows. For each lane, j, of the gel, the fraction of total protein molecules with exactly ipegylated cysteines was calculated asW j(i) = cpm(i)/Σcpm(i), where cpm(i) is the counts per minute in the ith bin. For example, in Fig. 3, in which each Kv construct has 2 cysteines, i ranges from 0 to 2. If each cysteine is assumed to label to the same extent in the steady state, the fraction F j of individual cysteines pegylated in the jth lane is ΣiW j(i)/N, whereN is the total number of cysteines in the protein molecule. For the gels in Figs. 3, F 1 is the fraction of individual cysteines labeled by PEG-MAL (lane 1).F 2 is the fraction of individual cysteines labeled by PEG-MAL after treatment with PDM (lane 2). From lane 3 the fraction of individual cysteines that has reacted with both PDM and PEG-SH isF 3. In most of our constructs, two cysteines were introduced. If these cysteines are sufficiently far from one another during PDM labeling, the probability of cross-linking them with PDM is very low. This analysis assumes that cross-linking by PDM did not occur after SDS denaturation. Our results will verify these assumptions either when the protein is denatured by SDS treatment or when the cysteines are sufficiently separated in the predicted crystal structure. By comparing the labeling in denatured versus nondenatured protein, we can estimate the cross-linking efficiency as follows. After SDS pretreatment (e.g. Fig. 3 B, right gel) F PDM-SDS is the fraction of individual cysteines labeled with PDM, given byF PDM-SDS = (F 1 −F 2)/F 1. From the same gel, F 3 = F PDM-SDS P PEG-SH, where P PEG-SH is the probability that an individual cysteine labeled with PDM has reacted with PEG-SH. Thus, P PEG-SH =F 3/((F 1 −F 2)/F 1). Using this estimate of P PEG-SH, we now can determine the probability of a pair of cysteines being cross-linked by PDM in the absence of SDS pretreatment (e.g. left gel in Fig. 3 B). As above, the fraction of individual cysteines labeled by PDM is F PDM = (F 1 −F 2)/F 1. The fraction of available free maleimides after PDM labeling in this case isF fMAL =F 3/P PEG-SH, whereF 3 is determined from lane 3 in the left gel of Fig. 3 B, and P PEG-SH was estimated as described above from SDS-pretreated channels. Finally, the probability of a pair of cysteines being cross-linked by PDM isP xlink = F PDM −F fMAL. One-way analysis of variance or a Student's t test was used to determine whether differences in P xlink values are statistically significant. To investigate when and in which compartment T1 monomers fold into their tertiary structure, we used a cross-linking strategy. Pairs of cysteines were engineered into the folded monomer interfaces of Kv1.3/cysteine-free, similar to strategies used to study oligomerization of T1 (9Lu J. Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Kobertz W.R. Williams C. Miller C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10347-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Guided by the crystal structure of T1 in Kv1.1a (14Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Stevens C.F. Choe S. Nature. 1998; 392: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), we devised three criteria to select appropriate pairs. First, the residues must be far enough apart in the primary sequence that they are proximate only when the protein is folded. Second, the pair must be within 5–10 Å in the folded T1 monomer and therefore within cross-linking distance. Third, the pair must be on the surface of the folded tetramer and therefore presumably nondisruptive and accessible to cross-linking reagents. Three pairs that fulfill these criteria are Arg83/Gln136, Gln72/Gly114, and Thr69/Gln112 (Fig. 1). The equivalent pairs in Kv1.1a are in layers 1 and 3 of the Kv1.1a T1 crystal structure for the first pair and layers 1 and 2 for the second and third pairs (see Fig. 7). Cysteine substitution of these residues in a cysteine-free background yields functional Kv1.3 channels, as determined by Xenopusoocyte expression and two-electrode voltage clamp (Fig. 3 A). R83C/Q136C, Q72C/G114C, and T69C/Q112C each expressed current with activation and inactivation time constants of 5.7 ± 0.3 ms (n = 4) and 60.2 ± 4.9 ms (n = 7), 5.0 ± 0.1 ms (n = 4) and 46.1 ± 1.9 ms (n = 4), and 5.5 ± 0.8 ms (n = 4) and 66.0 ± 6.0 ms (n = 4), respectively. The inactivation time constants are comparable with that of cysteine-free Kv1.3 (70 ± 3.5 ms inactivation time constant, n= 3). If the T1 monomer is folded, then we should be able to cross-link these engineered cysteines with bifunctional cysteine reagents. For this purpose, we have chosen o-phenyldimaleimide (o-PDM; Sigma), which has an intermaleimide distance of ∼6 Å. We used this reagent previously to cross-link cysteines engineered into the T1-T1 intersubunit interface (9Lu J. Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Any reaction of our T1 monomers with PDM can result in a mixture of five different species (Fig. 2), each of which will appear at the parent molecular weight on a NuPAGE protein gel. Thus, we needed a way to distinguish these five species and, in particular, a means to detect the intramolecularly cross-linked species (bottom row, right). For this purpose, we have designed a mass-tagging strategy using pegylation with both PEG-MAL and PEG-SH (see Ref. 16Lu J. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13288-13301Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar for details of the MAL-pegylation method). The addition of one of these PEG molecules shifts the protein molecular mass by ≥10 kDa. A free SH group can be labeled with PEG-MAL, and a free peptidyl-maleimide can be labeled with PEG-SH. Each species of PDM-modified protein will have a specific pattern of pegylation, but only the intramolecularly cross-linked protein will lack a gel shift with either PEG reagent and thus remain at the parent molecular weight on NuPAGE gel (Fig. 2). All other species will produce a gel shift with one or the other PEG reagent or both. To study when T1 folds and in which cellular compartment, we used biogenic intermediates that remain attached to the ribosome-translocon complex. In this case, the folded state of the Kv1.3 T1 domain can be assessed from the time of its emergence from the ribosome until its release into the bilayer. Using such intermediates, we have previously demonstrated that T1 can tetramerize prior to exit of membrane-bound Kv1.3 from the translocon, consistent with a folded T1 monomer at this stage (9Lu J. Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our first task was to test whether the strategies shown in Fig. 2 could detect an intramolecularly folded T1 in biogenic intermediates, namely in a BstEII-cut Kv1.3 intermediate attached to a membrane-bound ribosome. This intermediate contains S1–S5 and half of the pore region (9Lu J. Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). mRNA was made from truncated cDNA that lacks a stop codon in the coding region. Ribosomes halt when they reach the end of such a transcript, and the nascent peptide chain remains attached to the ribosome as a peptidyl-tRNA. We have previously demonstrated that this is true for Kv1.3 intermediates (9Lu J. Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Biogenic intermediates were made in a cysteine-free Kv1.3 for each of the pairs described above. Experimental data for the R83C/Q136C/BstEII-cut Kv1.3 intermediate are shown in Fig. 3 B. Most of the free cysteines (80%) were pegylated to give two bands at ∼ 55 and 70 kDa, equivalent to one and two PEG molecules per protein, respectively (Fig. 3 B, left gel, lane 1). Pretreatment of the protein with PDM blocked ∼93% of the free cysteines from reaction with PEG-MAL (Fig. 3 B,left gel, lane 2). This result suggests that most cysteines reacted with PDM to produce either free peptidyl-maleimides (Fig. 2, bottom left) or peptides containing neither free maleimides nor free cysteines (bottom right, the cross-linked species). When PDM-treated protein was exposed to PEG-SH, little or no pegylation occurred (Fig. 3 B, left gel,lane 3), indicating that almost no free maleimides were available in the protein. The probability that an individual cysteine has reacted with both PDM and PEG-SH is <0.1 (calculated from lane 3; see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, intramolecular cross-linking had occurred. This conclusion is supported by the experiment shown in the right gel of Fig. 3 B, in which the protein was first denatured with SDS (1%). Subsequently, the protein was treated as in the left gel in Fig. 3 B with PEG-MAL (lane 1) or first with PDM and then PEG-MAL (lane 2) or first with PDM and then PEG-SH (lane 3). Lane 2 in the left gel is similar to lane 2 in the right gel, indicating that the reactivities of cysteines to PDM are not affected by SDS denaturation prior to PDM labeling (F PDM = 0.97, see “Experimental Procedures”). However, a dramatic gel shift was observed following PEG-SH treatment (cf. lanes 3), indicating that no cross-linking had occurred. Presumably, this is because SDS unfolded the T1 monomers, thus separating the two engineered cysteines. The probability that an individual cysteine has reacted with both PDM and PEG-SH is ∼0.5 (calculated from lane 3, see “Experimental Procedures”). The data shown in Fig. 3 B represent steady-state measurements, since no changes in pegylation were observed for incubations at 1, 3 (data shown), or 5 h with PEG reagents or 15, 30, or 60 (data shown) min with PDM. Moreover, these data represent only membrane-bound nascent peptides, since contamination with membrane-free ribosomes is <5% (data not shown). R83C/Q136C did not exhibit a gel shift when treated with PEG-SH alone, yet it could be pegylated with PEG-MAL (data not shown). For the data in Fig. 3 B (right gel), the behavior of the single cysteine mutants alone predicts the observed probabilities. Each of the single mutants was pegylated (78 and 95% for R83C and Q136C, respectively), blocked with PDM (94 and 96%, respectively), and then pegylated following PDM-labeling (40–56%) (data not shown). If Gln136 was first denatured in SDS (unfolded) and then assayed for available cysteines and maleimides after PDM modification, the percentages of cysteines pegylated or blocked, or pegylated following PDM labeling, were relatively unchanged (75, 97, and 57%, respectively). Analysis of these results (see below) suggests that the presence of one cysteine in a pair does not affect the other cysteine (i.e. there is no cooperative pegylation, either positive or negative, between nearby cysteines). A similar lack of cooperativity was found for the intersubunit interface pair R118C/D126C in the Kv1.3 T1 domain (9Lu J. Robinson J.M. Edwards D. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10934-10946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have evaluated other pairs of engineered cysteines as potential folding assays, namely Q72C/G114C and T69C/Q112C. These pairs are in layers 1 and 2 according to the T1 crystal structure (14Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Stevens C.F. Choe S. Nature. 1998; 392: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 3 C, the Q72C/G114C construct exhibits strong intramolecular cross-linking. Lanes 3 are dramatically different for the two gels, the right gel representing prior SDS denaturation of the protein. The fraction of cysteines that reacted with both PDM and PEG-SH is 0.03 and 0.55 for the folded and unfolded peptide (lanes 3), respectively. Although the folding assay is qualitatively suggestive, we quantified the results to obtain calculated probabilities of cross-linking,P xlink. Such analysis permits a statistical evaluation. The probabilities may be calculated using the data obtained for pegylation, with and without SDS pretreatment, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For instance, for the two gels shown in Fig. 3 B, F 1 is the fraction of individual cysteines labeled by PEG-MAL (lane 1).F 2 is the fraction of individual cysteines labeled by PEG-MAL after treatment with PDM (lane 2). F 3 is the fraction of individual cysteines that has reacted with both PDM and PEG-SH. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” using these fractions,F 1–3 (Table I), we can calculate P xlink, the probability of a pair of cysteines being cross-linked by PDM.P xlink is 0.94 for Q72C/G114C. The T69C/Q112C construct has a lower cross-linking efficiency;P xlink is 0.68 (Fig. 3 D). In both cases, the single mutants (data not shown) account for the PEG-SH labeling shown in the double mutants. For comparison,P xlink for R83C/Q136C is 0.78 ± 0.05 (n = 7).Table IFraction of individual cysteines pegylatedConstructF 1F 2F 3nWith membranes R83C/Q136C/BstEII0.81 ± 0.020.04 ± 0.020.10 ± 0.027 R83C/Q136C/KpnI0.570.020.121 Q72C/G114C/BstEII0.630.010.031 T69C/Q112C/BstEII0.590.050.161 Q72C/Q136C/BstEII0.92 ± 0.030.01 ± 0.010.75 ± 0.013 R83C/Q136C/T65V/BstEII0.86 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.013 R83C/Q136C/T65D/BstEII0.77 ± 0.020.02 ± 0.020.30 ± 0.033Without membranes R83C/Q136C/BstEII0.85 ± 0.020.09 ± 0.040.33 ± 0.034 R83C/Q136C/KpnI0.650.030.291 Q72C/G114C/BstEII0.920.010.211 T69C/Q112C/BstEII0.870.080.501 Q72C/Q136C/BstEII0.82 ± 0.000.11 ± 0.000.63 ± 0.022 R83C/Q136C/T65V/BstEII0.920.110.36 ± 0.023 R83C/Q136C/T65D/BstEII0.89 ± 0.020.11 ± 0.030.43 ± 0.033Single mutants0.89 ± 0.030.03 ± 0.000.56 ± 0.055SDS-denatured R83C/Q136C/BstEII/+mm0.73 ± 0.040.05 ± 0.020.52 ± 0.023 R83C/Q136C/BstEII/−mm0.850.010.601 Q72C/G114C/BstEII/+mm0.830.070.551 T69C/Q112C/BstEII/+mm0.810.070.621 Q72C/Q136C/BstEII/+mm0.830.070.671 Q136C/BstEII/+mm0.76 ± 0.010.02 ± 0.00.60 ± 0.032Numbers are given as mean ± S.E. when n ≥ 3 and as mean ± average error when n = 2.

In addition to measurements on unfolded (SDS-denatured) protein, we performed another control. We engineered a pair of cysteines in the same region of the T1 domain, but farther apart in the folded tertiary T1 monomer, and they should therefore not be cross-linked with PDM treatment (Fig. 4 A). Gln72 and Gln136 (in layers 1 and 3 of the T1 crystal structure, respectively) are ∼14 Å apart in the folded T1 tertiary structure and are on the surface of the quaternary structure, accessible to PDM. Fig. 4 B indicates that the folded intermediates of BstEII-cut Q72C/Q136C were not cross-linked following PDM treatment. P xlink is 0.16 and 0.82 for Q72C/Q136C (left gel) and R83C/Q136C (right gel), respectively. Moreover,P xlink for Q72C/Q136C in the absence of membranes and in samples SDS denatured prior to PDM labeling, is 0.01 ± 0.02 (average of n = 2) and 0.00, respectively, similar to 0.03 ± 0.07 (n = 3) for Q72C/Q136C in the presence of membranes (see Fig. 5 and Table I). Thus, none of the incubation conditions per se lead to artifactual gel shifts.Figure 5Calculated probability of cross-linking,P xlink.

https://openalex.org/W2095194351,"We described previously that during the assembly of the α2β2 heterotetramer of human mitochondrial branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD), chaperonins GroEL/GroES interact with the kinetically trapped heterodimeric (αβ) intermediate to facilitate conversion of the latter to the native BCKD heterotetramer.

In contrast, an unfolded BCKD fusion protein of similar size, which also resides in the GroEL or SR1 cavity, is too large to be capped by GroES.

The efficient folding for most proteins has been shown to occur inside the cavity of the cis ring that houses the unfolded or partially folded protein, following encapsulation or capping of thecis ring by dome-shaped heptameric GroES in the presence of Mg-ATP (3Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The subsequent binding of Mg-ATP to the unoccupied ortrans ring of GroEL results in the collapse of thecis ring assembly with the concomitant release of GroES and partially or completely folded protein from the cis cavity. It has been generally accepted that only proteins of 55–57 kDa or smaller in size can fit inside the cavity encapsulated by GroES, as shown by in vivo (4Ewalt K.L. Hendrick J.P. Houry W.A. Hartl F.U.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) studies. For certain proteins larger than this size, for example, 75-kDa methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (3Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and 72-kDa phage P22 tailspike protein (7Gordon C.L. Sather S.K. Casjens S. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that are capable of binding to GroEL, chaperonin-assisted folding is independent of GroES. It was shown recently, however, that both chaperonins GroEL/GroES are required for the productive folding of an 86-kDa maltose-binding protein fusion (8Huang Y.S. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10405-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and 82-kDa mitochondrial aconitase (9Chaudhuri T.K. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Rospert S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, for this group of large proteins, productive folding is achieved through binding of GroES to thetrans ring of GroEL. GroEL was also shown to trap heat-induced inactive 98-kDa citrate synthase homodimers (10Grallert H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33305-33310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and thermally induced partially active 66-kDa rhodanese dimers (11Bhattacharyya A.M. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the presence of GroES and Mg-ATP, the trapped dimers of citrate synthase or rhodanese are released from GroEL in the monomeric form. It is not clear whether GroES binds in cis or in trans to the complex formed between GroEL and these relatively large folded intermediates. Our laboratory is interested in the potential role of chaperonins in promoting the assembly of mitochondrial macromolecular multi-enzyme complexes. We have shown that chaperonins GroEL/GroES are indispensable for both folding and assembly of the α2β2heterotetramer of branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD),1 a component of the 4 × 106-Da human mitochondrial BCKD complex, both inEscherichia coli (12Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro (13Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GroEL binds to an ensemble of 86-kDa αβ heterodimeric intermediates, which are kinetically trapped during assembly, to produce a stable GroEL-αβ complex. In the presence of GroES and Mg-ATP, the heterodimeric intermediate undergoes multiple rounds of dissociation and reassociation to facilitate the conversion of the heterodimeric intermediate to the native BCKD heterotetramer (14Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Song J.L. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22305-22312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our data have established the central role of chaperonin GroEL/GroES in promoting oligomeric protein assembly through iterative annealing of non-productive assembly intermediate. Because of the large size associated with the αβ assembly intermediate of BCKD, a question arises as to whether the productive folding of the GroEL-αβ complex proceeds through the cisor trans capping of the GroEL cavity by GroES. We have shown previously that the GroEL-αβ complex is resistant to protease digestion in the presence of GroES and Mg-ADP, suggesting the enclosure of the 86-kDa heterodimer inside the GroEL cis cavity by GroES (15Song J.L. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22305-22312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the interpretation of these data was complicated by the presence of the trans ring in GroEL. In the present study, we revisited this issue by investigating the encapsulation of the heterodimer inside GroEL along with its single-ring variant SR1. We showed that the 86-kDa heterodimeric intermediate inside the cavities of both GroEL and SR1 was encapsulated by GroES. In contrast, an unfolded fusion protein of similar size, which also resides in the GroEL or SR1 cavity, is too large to be capped by GroES. The 86-kDa heterodimeric intermediate represents the largest protein substrate ever known to fit inside the GroEL cis cavity underneath GroES. This finding indicates that for assembly intermediates with compact native-like conformations, the size limit for cisfolding is significantly larger than 57 kDa established for unfolded proteins (4Ewalt K.L.

Bacterial chaperonins GroEL/GroES and recombinant human BCKD were prepared as described previously (13Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 1-Anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS), trypsin (type III, from bovine pancreas), trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (from soybean), Reactive Red 120-agarose (type 3000-CL), and α-lactalbumin (type III, calcium-depleted, from bovine milk) were obtained from Sigma. Bovine lactoferrin was purchased from ICN Biochemicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). A pET vector for the expression of single-ring GroEL variant SR1 was a generous gift from Dr. Arthur Horwich. The expression plasmid for SR1 was transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells. Cells were grown in the LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C overnight, and expression for SR1 was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The SR1 protein was purified at 4 °C using a previously described protocol with modifications (16Horwich A.L. Burston S.G. Rye H.S. Weissman J.S. Fenton W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from 4-liter culture were collected and re-suspended in 150 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme. After cells were broken by sonication, the lysate was fractionated by centrifugation in a Ti60 rotor at 120,000 ×g for 35 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast-Flow column (Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). SR1-containing fractions were collected, and protein was precipitated with 65% ammonium sulfate. Following centrifugation, the protein pellet was dissolved in Buffer A, and solubilized proteins were fractionated on an FPLC Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated in the same buffer. At this stage, the SR1 protein was >98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. To remove minor contaminants, it was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 5 mm MgCl2 and purified further on a Reactive Red 120-Agarose (type 3000-CL) dye column equilibrated in the same buffer (17Clark A.C. Ramanathan R. Frieden C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 100-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the construction of an expression plasmid for the α-11-β fusion, three fragments from the pHisT-E1 vector (18Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were produced: a 45-bp NcoI/XhoI fragment containing the His6 tag and the tobacco etch-virus protease cleavage site, a 751-bp XhoI/SmaI fragment encoding a 5′ portion of the α subunit, and a 1202-bpPstI/EcoRI fragment encoding a C-terminal segment of the β subunit. The linker region of 11 amino acids (GSEALEAAERS) between the α and β subunit was derived from the sequence connecting the α and β domains of tryptophan synthase (19Burns D.M. Horn V. Paluh J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2060-2069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence encoding this linker was 5′-GGATCCGAAGCATTAGAAGCCGCTGAGAGATCT-3′, which contained aBamHI site at the 5′ end and a BglII site at the 3′ terminus. The BCKD-α cDNA with the linker immediately downstream of the 3′ cDNA end was amplified, followed by digestion of the PCR product to produce a SmaI/BamHI fragment. The BCKD-β cDNA with the linker attached to the 5′ cDNA end was also amplified, and digestion of this PCR product resulted in a PstI/BamHI fragment. TheSmaI/BamHI and PstI/BamHI fragments, along with the above three fragments derived from the pHisT-E1 plasmid, were ligated into the pTrcHisB expression vector (Invitrogen) pre-digested with NcoI and EcoRI. The resultant plasmid pHisT-α-11-β and the pGroESL plasmid overexpressing GroEL and GroES (12Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were co-transformed into BL21 cells. Transformed cells were grown in the LB medium at 37 °C untilA 600 nm at 0.75 was reached. Expression of the BCKD fusion protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by an overnight growth at 37 °C. The His6-tagged BCKD α-11-β fusion protein was isolated from the cell lysate with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described previously (18Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). KSCN-induced αβ heterodimers were produced by incubating His6-tagged BCKD (11.5 μm, α2β2 heterotetramer) with 400 mm KSCN in Buffer B (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl) containing 2 mmdithiothreitol for 45 min at 23 °C (14Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture was diluted 2-fold into Buffer B containing 8 μm GroEL or SR1. Following incubation for 4 h at 23 °C, the complex formed was purified on an FPLC Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Fractions containing the GroEL-αβ or the SR1-αβ complex were collected and concentrated in a Millipore (Bedford, MA) Ultrafree-15 filter device with a 30-kDa cut-off membrane. GroEL-α-11-β and SR1-α-11-β complexes were prepared by diluting the 8 m urea-denatured α-11-β fusion protein into Buffer C (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl) containing GroEL or SR1 on ice. The mixture was kept at 4 °C overnight, concentrated, and purified on an FPLC Superdex 200 column as described above. GroEL-protein and SR1-protein complexes at 0.8 μg/μl in Buffer C with or without 0.67 μg/μl GroES, 13 mmMg-ADP, or Mg-ATP were subjected to limited digestion with 20 μg/ml trypsin at 23 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor to a final concentration of 27 μg/ml. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a combination of anti-α subunit and anti-β subunit antibodies as a probe. The urea-denatured α-11-β fusion protein was generated by incubation with 8 m urea at 23 °C for 1 h. Native BCKD, the KSCN-induced heterodimer, or the urea-denatured α-11-β fusion protein at 0.1 mg/ml was mixed with 50 μm ANS in Buffer C. Emission spectra were recorded from 400 to 550 nm with the excitation wavelength at 365 nm on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrometer LS 50B. Each spectrum was an average of three consecutive scans and was corrected for contributions from the buffer solution. The SR1-β complex was prepared as described previously except that SR1 was used instead of GroEL (13Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The SR1-αβ or SR1-β complex (60 μg) was incubated with 100 μg of GroES in Buffer C containing 5 mm Mg-ATP for 5 min at 23 °C. The mixture was fractionated on an HPLC G3000SWXL gel filtration column in the same buffer containing 0.1 mm Mg-ATP. As a control, the SR1-β complex was incubated with GroES in the absence of Mg-ATP and separated on HPLC with Mg-ATP omitted from the column buffer. 5 min after the sample injection, fractions were collected every 20 s and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To determine the stoichiometry of protein components in the SR1-αβ-GroES or the SR1-β-GroES complex, different amounts of SR1, BCKD, or GroES were run on the same gel. After staining with Coomassie Blue, gels were scanned on a Molecular Dynamics densitometer (model 300A) and analyzed by ImageQuant. Standard curves for SR1, BCKD, and GroES were generated by plotting the known amount of the protein against the intensity of the band on the same gel. The amount of each protein component in the SR1-αβ (or -β)-GroES complex was calculated using the standard curve for each protein. The renaturation of urea-denatured BCKD and α-11-β fusion protein was carried out as described previously (13Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). BCKD activity was also recovered by incubating 0.8 μm of the GroEL-αβ or the GroEL-α-11-β complex with 2 μm GroES and 10 mm Mg-ATP as described previously (14Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged αβ heterodimeric intermediate in the BCKD assembly pathway was produced by incubating the N-terminally His6-tagged BCKD α2β2heterotetramer in 400 mm KSCN for 45 min at 23 °C, followed by a 2-fold dilution. The size of the resultant αβ heterodimer was 86 kDa, as determined by FPLC gel filtration and dynamic light scattering in the presence of 200 mm KSCN (14Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A second target protein, the His6-tagged α-11-β fusion, was generated by fusing the N-terminally His6-tagged α subunit to the β subunit through an 11-residue linker derived from E. coli tryptophan synthase (19Burns D.M. Horn V. Paluh J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2060-2069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α-11-β fusion migrated as a 170-kDa species in FPLC gel filtration, similar to the size of wild-type BCKD heterotetramer. The α-11-β fusion shows K m values of 0.5 μm for thiamin pyrophosphate and 62 μm for substrate α-ketoisovalerate, essentially indistinguishable from those obtained with the wild-type BCKD (TableI). The k cat value for the α-11-β fusion is 4.0 s−1, which is approximately one-half that obtained with the wild-type BCKD. The size of the 8 m urea-denatured α-11-β fusion was determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation (data not shown). The data were fitted to a single species model with a size of 86,671 Da for the unfolded α-11-β fusion polypeptide. The above data, taken together, indicate that the native α-11-β exists as a homodimeric protein.Table IKinetic constants for wild-type α2β2 and α-11-β fusion BCKDK m, thiamin pyrophosphateK m, α-ketoisovaleratek catμmμms −1BCKD0.66628.25α-11-β fusion0.5624.0 Open table in a new tab Conformations of the target proteins were characterized by fluorometry using the ANS as a hydrophobic probe. Native and urea-denatured proteins were incubated with 50 μm ANS. The reaction mixtures were excited at 365 nm, and fluorescence emission measured as a function of wavelength (Fig. 1). ANS bound to the αβ assembly intermediate or the α2β2 native BCKD exhibits similar spectra with a maximum at 473 nm. The data indicate that the heterodimeric assembly intermediate possesses a folded structure similar to native BCKD. In contrast, the urea-denatured α-11-β fusion with the unfolded conformation fail to bind to ANS, as indicated by the absence of fluorescence emission after subtracting emission from the unbound ANS. Double-ring GroEL or its single-ring variant SR1 was incubated with a molar excess of KSCN-induced αβ heterodimer; the resultant GroEL-αβ and SR1-αβ complexes were purified by FPLC gel filtration. Identical amounts of the GroEL-αβ or the SR1-αβ complex were incubated with GroES and trypsin in the presence or absence of nucleotides for 10 min at 23 °C. Digestion mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (upper panel) and Western blotting (lower panel) (Fig. 2). In the absence of GroES and nucleotide, the αβ heterodimer bound to GroEL was digested completely after incubation of the complex with trypsin (Fig. 2,both panels, lane 2). The heterodimer was also digested when GroES alone (lane 3), or GroES and Mg-ATP (lane 5) were added to the GroEL-αβ complex (Fig. 2, both panels). Under these conditions, GroES was unable to form a stable complex with GroEL, resulting in the degradation of the αβ heterodimer by the protease. The smaller bands under GroEL, which are stained with Coomassie Blue (upper panel), do not represent the undigested αβ heterodimer, as indicated by the absence of cross-reacting materials in Western blotting with the combined anti-α and anti-β antibodies as probes (Fig. 2,lower panel, lanes 3 and5). These smaller bands, which migrate slower than GroES, are proteolytic products of GroEL. In the presence of Mg-ADP and GroES (lane 4), a significant portion of the heterodimer bound to GroEL was protected from tryptic digestion (Fig. 2, both panels). The amounts of α and β subunits resistant to trypsin digestion were 56.3 and 39.7%, respectively, of the starting material (lane 1) as determined by densitometry of the Western blot (Fig. 2, lower panel). The data are explained by the fact that GroES binds equally to either the cis or thetrans ring of GroEL, resulting in approximately half of thecis cavity being capped by GroES. Only the αβ heterodimer inside the GroES-enclosed cis cavity is resistant to tryptic digestion. Under identical conditions, the SR1-αβ complex was digested with trypsin in the presence of GroES with or without nucleotides. Only in the presence of GroES and Mg-ATP, where a stable SR1-GroES complex was found (3Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), was the SR1-bound αβ heterodimer resistant to tryptic digestion (Fig. 2, both panels, lane 10). The α and β subunits protected from the protease digestion (lane 10) were 89.4 and 101.4% of the starting materials (lane 6), respectively, as measured by densitometry of the Western blot (Fig. 2, lower panel). The results corroborate that 86-kDa αβ native-like heterodimer, despite its large size, fits inside the single SR1 cavity encapsulated by GroES, similar to that observed with GroEL. Similar protease protection assays were carried out with the complex formed between urea-unfolded α-11-β fusion and GroEL or SR1. Incubation of the urea-denatured α-11-β fusion with GroEL or SR1 produced stable GroEL-α-11-β and SR1-α-11-β complexes, which were isolated as single species by FPLC gel filtration (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, the α-11-β fusion bound to GroEL was digested completely as indicated by Coomassie Blue staining, even when both GroES and Mg-ADP were present (lane 4). These conditions facilitate the formation of a stable GroEL-GroES-ADP7 complex. The data indicate that unfolded α-11-β fusion, despite its similar size to the αβ heterodimer, cannot be enclosed by GroES inside GroEL cavities. As positive controls, the unfolded α-11-β fusion bound to GroEL was also digested completely when GroES (lane 2) or the nucleotide (lane 3) was absent or when GroES and Mg-ATP were present (lane 5) (Fig. 3). In the same experiment, the unfolded α-11-β bound to the single-ring SR1 was also digested completely by trypsin in the presence of GroES and Mg-ATP (Fig. 3, lane 10). In the presence of Mg-ATP, GroES binds to unoccupied SR1 to form a stable complex. The data indicate that unfolded α-11-β in the SR1 cavity prevents the capping of SR1 by GroES, resulting in degradation of the unfolded α-11-β fusion. The bands under GroEL (lanes 3–5) and SR1 (lanes 8–10) are degradation products of the respective chaperonin (Fig. 3), similar to those shown in Fig. 2. These bands only appear when GroES is present, which is consistent with the finding that interactions between GroEL and GroES result in conformational changes in the former (20Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that in the presence of Mg-ATP, a portion of the αβ heterodimer in the GroEL-αβ complex undergoes dissociation, resulting in the release of the α subunit into the bulk solvent (15Song J.L. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22305-22312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The SR1-αβ preparation showed that only 55% of SR1 cavities were filled with the αβ heterodimer (see Fig. 5 B). It is possible that in the presence of GroES and Mg-ATP, the αβ heterodimer in the SR1-αβ complex also dissociates into individual subunits with the released α subunit binding to a new unoccupied SR1 cavity prior to the capping by GroES. In this scenario, the individual SR1-α and SR1-β complexes would present no size constraints for GroES capping and would be protected from tryptic digestion. To rule out this possibility, remaining empty cavities in the SR1-αβ preparation were filled by incubation with excess calcium-depleted reduced 14-kDa α-lactalbumin that binds to chaperonins with high affinity (21Murai N. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19957-19963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fully occupied SR1 cavities were then capped by GroES in the presence of Mg-ATP. After tryptic digestion, the levels of protected α and β subunits were determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and quantified by densitometry. Fig. 4 shows that most, if not all, of the α and β subunits in the fully occupied SR1-αβ-GroES preparation are recovered at the levels of 81 and 83%, respectively, of the amount in the undigested complex. Because all SR1 cavities are occupied, if α and β subunits were released into the bulk solution, they would not be able to bind to new SR1 cavities and would therefore be degraded by the protease. The above results exclude the possibility that the heterodimer dissociates into individual α and β subunits with the α subunit escaping from the original SR1 cavity prior to capping of the same cavity by GroES.Figure 4Recovery of BCKD subunits from the trypsin-digested SR1-αβ complex saturated with calcium-free reduced α-lactalbumin. The SR1-αβ complex was incubated with a large excess amount of calcium-depleted reduced α-lactalbumin in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5 mm EGTA for 10 min at 23 °C. The α-lactalbumin-saturated SR1-αβ complex preparation was purified on an FPLC Superdex 200 column, followed by tryptic digestion in the presence of GroES and Mg-ATP as described for Fig. 2. The same amount of the SR1-αβ complex with trypsin omitted served as a control. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-α antibody or anti-β antibody, respectively. Densities of the α subunit and the β subunit on the same blot were scanned and quantified. The densities of α and β subunits without trypsin digestion were set as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The enclosure of the SR1-αβ complex by GroES was deciphered further. As a control, in the absence of Mg-ATP, SR1-β and excess GroES do not form a complex and migrate separately in HPLC-gel filtration (Fig. 5 A, top panel). In the presence of Mg-ATP, a fraction of GroES co-migrates with SR1-β to produce a stable SR1-β-GroES complex (Fig. 5 A, middle panel). Molar stoichiometry of SR1:β:GroES in the ternary complex is 1:0.86:0.90 as determined by scanning densitometry (Fig. 5 B). The data confirm that Mg-ATP promotes the stable binding of GroES to SR1, without causing the release of the protein substrate. In a parallel experiment, the SR1-αβ complex was incubated with excess GroES and Mg-ATP, followed by separation by HPLC-gel filtration. As also shown in Fig. 5 A (bottom panel), a stoichiometric amount of GroES binds to SR1-αβ complex. The molar ratio of SR1:αβ:GroES was estimated to be 1:0.55:1.08 (Fig. 5 B). The result indicates that 45% of the SR1 cavity is not occupied by the protein substrate. This was corroborated by the additional binding of calcium-depleted reduced α-lactalbumin to the same SR1-αβ preparation at a subunit ratio of SR1:α-lactalbumin = 1:0.40 (data not shown). The combined data indicate that the αβ heterodimer remains inside the same SR1 cavity during the capping of SR1 by GroES and that all of the SR1 cavities including those occupied by the αβ heterodimer are encapsulated by GroES. Because the single-ring SR1 was unable to refold BCKD proteins, a complete system comprising the double-ring GroEL complex, GroES, and Mg-ATP was utilized in refolding studies. Incubation of the GroEL-αβ complex with GroES and Mg-ATP resulted in a recovery of 72% of BCKD activity (Fig. 6 A). The activity of BCKD heterotetramer based on the amount of heterodimer present in the GroEL-αβ complex was set at 100%. The heterodimeric intermediate does not possess enzyme activity. The renaturation of BCKD activity at 30% with the GroEL-α-11-β fusion complex in the presence of GroES and Mg-ATP was markedly less than that obtained with the GroEL-αβ complex. The activity of the active α-11-β homodimer equivalent to the amount of the unfolded monomer in the GroEL-α-11-β fusion complex was set at 100%. Essentially no BCKD activity was recovered with either the GroEL-αβ complex or the GroEL-α-11-β fusion complex when Mg-ATP or GroES alone was added to the refolding mixture. Chaperonin-mediated recovery of BCKD activity was also studied using 8m urea-denatured wild-type BCKD or α-11-β fusion protein, instead of the GroEL-protein complex, as substrate (Fig. 6 B). The recovery of BCKD activity with urea-denatured wild-type BCKD was also high at 90% in the presence of GroEL/GroES and Mg-ATP. By comparison, the recovery of BCKD activity at 25% with the urea-denatured α-11-β fusion protein in the presence of GroEL/GroES and Mg-ATP was significantly lower than that with urea-denatured wild-type BCKD. No BCKD activity was recovered from the denatured α-11-β fusion protein when GroES was omitted from the refolding mixture. The αβ heterodimeric intermediate can be isolated fromE. coli during expression and assembly of the native BCKD heterotetramer (18Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The heterodimer represents an ensemble of trapped energy minima, which in the absence of chaperonins does not dimerize to form the native heterotetramer in vitro (14Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have described previously that the heterodimer does not dissociate into monomers in a measurable equilibrium and binds to GroEL as an intact species with an apparent dissociation constant (K D) of 1.1 × 10−7m (15Song J.L. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22305-22312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The 86-kDa heterodimeric intermediate bound to GroEL was shown to be partially protected from protease digestion in the presence of Mg-ADP and GroES (15Song J.L. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22305-22312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The data strongly suggest that GroES is capable of capping this large assembly intermediate inside the GroEL cis cavity. In the present study, we extended the investigation by determining the ability of GroES to encapsulate the heterodimeric intermediate inside the GroEL single-ring variant SR1, taking advantage of the absence of the trans ring. Mutations of R452E, E461A, S463A, and V464A in the GroEL equatorial domain prevent the back to back stacking of the two GroEL rings, resulting in the formation of the single-ring complex SR1 (16Horwich A.L. Burston S.G. Rye H.S. Weissman J.S. Fenton W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The heterodimeric intermediate binds to SR1 to produce a stable SR1-αβ complex. In the presence of Mg-ATP, but not Mg-ADP, the SR1-αβ complex interacts with GroES, resulting in the existence of a stable SR1-αβ-GroES ternary complex. The absence of thetrans ring in SR1 confers complete protection of the heterodimer inside the SR1 cavity (Fig. 2). However, it is reasonable to ask whether the heterodimer inside the single SR1 cavity dissociates into individual α and β subunits prior to the capping by GroES in the presence of Mg-ATP, followed by the release and rebinding of these individual subunits to different unoccupied chaperonins. In this scenario, new SR1 cavities would harbor the smaller 48.5-kDa α (with the His6 tag) or 37.5-kDa β subunit, rather than the larger 86-kDa αβ heterodimer, to be capped by GroES. We approached this question by studying the binding of GroES to fully occupied SR1 (Fig. 4). Empty cavities in the preparation of the SR1-αβ complex were filled by incubation with an excess amount of reduced and calcium-depleted α-lactalbumin (19Burns D.M. Horn V. Paluh J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2060-2069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fully occupied SR1 preparation was encapsulated by GroES in the presence of Mg-ATP. The close to complete recovery of both α and β subunits at 1:1 stoichiometry following the tryptic digestion strongly supports the notion that both subunits of the αβ heterodimer remain inside the original SR1 cavity when the latter is capped by GroES. The equal molar ratio of SR1:GroES in the SR1-αβ-GroES ternary complex indicates further that the heterodimer in the SR1-αβ complex is enclosed uniformly by GroES (Fig. 5 B). Thus, our data validate the encapsulation of the large heterodimeric intermediate inside GroEL and SR1 cavities by GroES. The 86-kDa heterodimer represents the largest partially folded intermediate that is known to be capped by GroES inside the chaperonin cavity. The crystal structure of GroEL-GroES-ADP7 complex shows a 2-fold enlargement of the cis cavity over thetrans to a volume of 175,000 Å3 (20Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). This volume theoretically is capable of accommodating a globular protein of ∼142 kDa beneath GroES, assuming a perfect fit to the actual folded protein volume (20Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the upper limit for an unfolded protein to be encapsulated inside the GroEL cavity by GroES has been shown to be 57 kDa in both in vitro (6Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and in vivo (4Ewalt K.L. Hendrick J.P. Houry W.A. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1997; 90: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 5Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) studies. This size constraint of 57 kDa for an unfolded protein may reflect that an unfolded polypeptide is more extended than the fully folded protein of similar size. As a result, the space larger than the actual protein volume is needed for an unfolded protein inside the cis cavity to be encapsulated by GroES. As a case in point, we show that the urea-denatured 86-kDa α-11-β fusion cannot be capped by GroES inside GroEL and SR1 cavity, which is consistent with the above size limit for unfolded proteins. Capping of the native-like 86-kDa α-11-β monomeric intermediate has not been studied, because this species cannot be isolated. On the other hand, the αβ heterodimeric assembly intermediate with a size similar to the α-11-β fusion possesses a native-like conformation as indicated by ANS fluorescence analysis. The three-dimensional structure of the heterodimeric intermediate has not been determined. Based on the recently solved crystal structure of the native human BCKD heterotetramer, the heterodimeric intermediate contains folded α/β domains in both α and β subunits (22Ævarsson A. Chuang J. Wynn M. Truley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 277-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In each subunit, the central β sheet is buried by outer α helices in various orientations. Proteins with this kind of folded conformation have been shown to be dependent on chaperonin for proper folding (5Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The estimated volume of 132,800 Å3 for the heterodimeric intermediate enables it to fit completely inside the GroELcis cavity, so as to be encapsulated by GroES as illustrated by simulated packing (Fig. 7). Volume changes upon protein unfolding may also explain the striking difference between the SR1-αβ and the SR1-α-11-β complexes with respect to their ability to be capped by GroES. The partial specific volume change Δν° accompanying protein denaturation can be expressed as a sum of three terms, Δν° = ΔνV + ΔνT + ΔνI, where ΔνVrepresents changes due to the loss of intramolecular voids; ΔνT represents changes in thermal volume, which result from thermally induced mutual molecular vibrations between the unfolded protein and the solvent; and ΔνI is the interaction volume that represents changes in the solvent volume resulting from interactions of water molecules with charged and polar groups of the unfolded protein (23Chalikian T.V. Bresiauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1996; 39: 619-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The terms ΔνV and ΔνI are inherently negative upon protein unfolding, whereas ΔνT is a positive term associated with the increase in the accessible surface area of the unfolded protein. For a protein of 70 kDa in size, the complete unfolding results in a 30% increase in the partial specific volume mainly because of the positive change in the thermal volume, ΔνT (23Chalikian T.V. Bresiauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1996; 39: 619-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is predicted that the larger the protein, the greater increase in the partial specific volume of the unfolded state. Chemical denaturant-induced unfolding such as urea denaturation may still result in measurable residual structures (24Dill K.A. Shortle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 795-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). However, it is reasonable to expect a significant increase in the specific volume of the urea-denatured 86-kDa α-11-β fusion protein compared with its folded counterpart,i.e. the native-like αβ heterodimer of similar size and essentially identical sequences. The enlarged volume, along with the extended structure, may account for the inability of the unfolded α-11-β fusion to be enclosed by GroES inside the SR1 or GroEL cavity. We have shown previously that chaperonins GroEL/GroES and Mg-ATP promote dissociation/reassociation cycles of the trapped heterodimeric intermediate to facilitate its conversion to the functional heterotetramer (14Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Song J.L. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22305-22312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The encapsulation of the heterodimeric intermediate suggests strongly that the unfolding and dissociation of the heterodimer into individual α and β subunits occurs inside the encapsulated GroEL cis cavity. The subsequent binding of Mg-ATP to the open trans ring triggers the collapse of thecis assembly. The individual α and β subunits released into the bulk solvent reassemble to produce new heterodimeric intermediates with a fraction capable of dimerizing into the native heterotetramer. The dissociation/reassociation cycle perpetuates until all the trapped heterodimeric intermediates are converted to heterotetrameric BCKD. The apparent cis folding throughout the BCKD assembly pathway explains the high levels of BCKD activity recovered with either urea-denatured BCKD or the GroEL-αβ complex as substrate. By contrast, the failure of GroES to encapsulate the unfolded α-11-β fusion dictates the chaperonin-mediatedtrans folding of this protein, similar to that described for 86-kDa maltose-binding protein fusion (8Huang Y.S. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10405-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and 82-kDa aconitase (9Chaudhuri T.K. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Rospert S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thetrans folding mechanism may confer, in part, the markedly lower recovery of BCKD activity with the GroEL-α-11-β complex than that using the GroEL-αβ complex as the starting material. We thank Arthur Horwich for kindly supplying the SR1 expression plasmid and Max Wynn and Diana Tomchick for help in simulated molecular graphics of the GroEL-αβ-GroES complex."

For example, β-endorphin was shown to enhance intracellular calcium mobilization in murine splenic T cells, which was inhibited by naltrindole, a selective DOR antagonist, whereas the selective μ-opioid receptor antagonist was ineffective (2Sharp B.M.

In addition, the enhancement of human T-cell proliferation by certain methionine-enkephalin analogs could be completely abolished by naloxone and selective DOR antagonists (3Singh V.K. Bajpai k.

It was also reported that DOR agonists such as deltorphin and SNC-80 could concentration-dependently suppress the expression of human immunodeficiency virus-1 in DOR-transfected human T cells (4Sharp B.M. Gekker G., Li, M.D. Chao C.C. Peterson P.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DOR transcripts and DOR protein have been detected in mouse splenic and thymic T cells, as well as in some human or murine T-cell lines (5Gaveriaux C. Peluso J. Simonin F. Laforet J. Kieffer B.

Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of the dor gene in T cells may raise the possibility of regulating the immunomodulatory effects of δ-opioids on T cells by manipulation of the expression of DOR. Previously, we analyzed a 1.3-kilobase pair DNA fragment immediately upstream of the translation start site (−1300 to +1 base pair, with the translation start site designated as +1) of the mousedor gene in a mouse neuronal cell line and identified a minimum promoter region (−262 to −141); a GC box (−226 to −221) and a composite Ets-1-binding site/E box (−192 to −180) were found crucial for the promoter activity (11Liu H.C. Shen J.T. Augustin L.B., Ko, J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23617-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45462-45469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that the minimum dor promoter was also sufficient to confer constitutive dor promoter activity in EL-4 cells, a mouse T cell line that constitutively expresses DOR. In addition, increased binding activity of Ikaros (Ik) at an Ik-binding site (−378 to −374) was demonstrated to account for the significantly enhanceddor promoter activity in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated EL-4 cells (13Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12854-12860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, further analyses were carried out in EL-4 cells. Through both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we have demonstrated that Ik-2 homodimers bind to the −378/−374 Ik-binding site and exerts a position-dependent trans-activation effect on thedor promoter. Moreover, the E box (−185 to −180), which binds upstream stimulatory factor (USF), is essential for thedor promoter activity in both resting and PHA-activated T cells. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Ik-2 and USF synergize in trans-activating the dor promoter via the putative Ik-binding site and the E box, respectively. The luciferase fusion plasmids pD1300 and pD400 were constructed as described previously (13Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12854-12860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mutant constructs pD400MIK2 and pD400ME were constructed using the Altered Sites II in vivo mutagenesis system (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The Ik-2 expression vector was created by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the reverse transcription products from the total RNA of the EL-4 cell. The upper primer bears the essential Kozak sequence and the lower primer bears the XbaI site. The PCR product was inserted into theEcoRV and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The pD1300IK and pD400AS constructs were generated by PCR. All of the correct clones were confirmed by sequencing. Mouse lymphoma EL-4 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, and 4.5 g/liter glucose. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% air. EL-4 cells were transfected using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were transfected with equimolar amount of each plasmid. After a 24-hour culture with or without PHA (1.5 μg/ml), cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). A one-fifth molar ratio of PCH110 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by an SV40 promoter was included in each transfection for normalization. Bacterially expressed recombinant human USF-1 and mouse Ik-2 were prepared as described by Pognonec et al. (14Pognonec P. Kato H. Sumimoto H. Kretzschmar M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, competent JM109 bacteria cells were transformed with human USF-1 or mouse Ik-2 expression vectors. The cultures were grown and induced at 28 °C overnight. The bacteria pellet was lysed by sonication in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% (v/v) aprotinin (Sigma), 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The sonicated sample was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Then, saturated ammonium sulfate was added dropwise to the supernatant to a final concentration of 33% (v/v). After 15 min on ice, the sample was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer and centrifuged again. Then the supernatant was diluted with lysis buffer devoid of NaCl. The partially purified recombinant protein products, proved to comprise predominantly the desired recombinant proteins by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis plus Coomassie Blue staining, were used in subsequent gel retardation assays in which the purification product from mock-transformed bacteria cells was employed to incubate with the radiolabeled probe as a control. Nuclear extracts were prepared from resting or PHA-activated EL-4 cells using the method described by Johnson et al. (15Johnson D.R. Levant S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids pD400, pD400MIK2, and pD400ME were digested with KpnI, dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, and then digested with NcoI to generate the 5′-labeled 400-base pair probes, which were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The double-stranded oligonucleotide D198/169 was 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The probes were incubated with EL-4 nuclear extracts or the indicated amounts of recombinant protein(s) in EMSA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)). For competition analysis, a 75-fold molar excess of cold probe was added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For supershift assays, 2 μg of anti-Ik, anti-USF-1, or anti-USF-2 antibody (Ab) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the mixture. The reaction was then incubated on ice for 1 h. Protein-DNA complexes and free DNA were fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 1× Tris borate-EDTA electrophoresis buffer at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography. 16 μg of nuclear extracts prepared from an equal amount of unstimulated or PHA-activated EL-4 cells was loaded onto 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membrane (Millipore). Membranes were incubated for 1 h with a 1/1000 dilution of anti-USF-1 or anti-USF-2 Ab and then washed and revealed using anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1/5000, 1 h). Peroxidase was revealed with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit. Proteins were quantified before being loaded onto the gel, and equal loading of extracts was verified by Ponceau coloration. Previously we reported that in parallel with the augmented expression of nuclear Ik proteins, the increased binding of Ik family members at an Ik-binding site (−378 to −374) in the mouse dor promoter enhanced thedor promoter activity in PHA-activated EL-4 cells, a mouse T cell line that constitutively expresses DOR (13Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12854-12860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As only Ik-1 and Ik-2 are the predominant Ik isoforms capable of DNA binding in the nucleus (16Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 17Sun L. Liu A.P. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), we employed the mouse Ik-1 and Ik-2 expression vectors in the present study to determine the individual roles of these proteins in trans-activating the dor promoter. The Ik-1 or Ik-2 expression vector was transfected into EL-4 cells with pD400, a mousedor promoter/luciferase fusion plasmid encompassing thedor promoter sequence from −400 to +1, or pD400MIK2, a mutant of pD400 with a point mutation in the core binding motif of the −378/−374 Ik-binding site (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B, pD400 and pD400MIK2 displayed similar promoter activities in resting EL-4 cells. Overexpressed Ik-2 enhanced the promoter activity of pD400 by ∼2-fold, almost to the level of that activated by PHA, while showing no effect on pD400MIK2. In addition, overexpressed Ik-1 exerted no detectable effect on the promoter activity of pD400. These results indicate that Ik-2 but not Ik-1 can trans-activate the dor promoter via the −378/−374 Ik-binding site. To determine the binding activity of individual Ik proteins at the putative Ik-binding site, EMSAs were performed with recombinant Ik-1 and Ik-2. Two DNA fragments, D400 and MIK2, corresponding to thedor promoter sequences from −400 to +1 in constructs pD400 and pD400MIK2, respectively, were employed as probes (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig. 2 B, 50 ng of Ik-2 readily formed a complex with D400 (lane 4), which was completely abolished by molar excess of unlabeled D400 (lane 6). In contrast, the cold competitor MIK2 with a mutation in the −378/−374 Ik-binding site was not able to reduce the Ik-2·D400 complex (lane 7). In addition, anti-Ik Ab shifted the complex to a higher position (lane 9). Together these results demonstrate that Ik-2 can specifically bind to the −378/−374 Ik-binding site in thedor promoter. Interestingly, it was observed that no detectable DNA-protein complex was formed using 50 ng of Ik-1 (lane 2), and a higher concentration of Ik-1 (250 ng) formed only a faint band with D400 (lane 3). Moreover, the Ik-2·D400 complex apparently was reduced in the presence of 50 ng of Ik-1, without the formation of any other detectable DNA-protein complex (lane 5). As the Ik isoforms bind to DNA through dimerization (16Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 17Sun L. Liu A.P. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), these results demonstrate that both Ik-1 homodimers and Ik-1/Ik-2 heterodimers have a very low affinity for the −378/−374 Ik-binding site, whereas Ik-2 homodimers can exert efficient binding to the putative Ik-binding site. This is consistent with the results in the functional assays that overexpression of Ik-2 but not Ik-1 significantly increased the dor promoter activity via the −378/−374 Ik-binding site (Fig. 1). Collectively, these results indicate that Ik-2 binds to the −378/−374 Ik-binding site and trans-activate the dor promoter mainly in the form of Ik-2 homodimers. We previously reported the identification of a minimum mouse dor promoter (−262 to −141) in mouse neuronal cell lines; this region contains a GC box (−226 to −221) and a composite Ets-1-binding site/E box (−192 to −180) that contribute to the constitutive dor promoter activity (11Liu H.C. Shen J.T. Augustin L.B., Ko, J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23617-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45462-45469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The minimum dor promoter was found sufficient to confer the constitutive promoter activity in resting T cells as well (13Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12854-12860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutation in the GC box or the Ets-1-binding site did not result in a significant decrease in the dor promoter activity in either resting or PHA-activated EL-4 T cells (data not shown). However, mutation in the E box as present in pD400ME (Fig. 3 A) almost completely abolished the promoter activity of pD400 in both resting and PHA-activated EL-4 cells (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the E box is required for the basal dor promoter activity in T cells. EMSAs were performed to determine the protein binding activity at the E box. Oligonucleotides D198/169 and Dm185, synthesized as probes, correspond to the dor promoter sequence from −198 to −169 in constructs pD400 and pD400ME, respectively (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 B, nuclear extracts from resting EL-4 cells formed a major complex with D198/169 (lane 2). Molar excess of unlabeled D198/169 abolished the complex formation (lane 3). In contrast, the cold competitor Dm185 with a mutation in the E box was not able to reduce the complex formation (lane 4). In addition, both anti-USF-1 Ab and anti-USF-2 Ab shifted the complex to a higher position (lanes 6 and 7). These results demonstrate that USF family members specifically bind to the E box in the dor promoter in EL-4 cells. Moreover, it was noted that the USF-binding activity at the E box basically did not change in PHA-activated EL-4 cells (lanes 8 and 9), consistent with the results from Western blot analysis that the expression of USF-1 or USF-2 is not changed in PHA-activated EL-4 cells compared with that in the unstimulated cells (Fig. 4 C). Combined with the data from the mutational analysis (Fig. 3), these results indicate that USF family members specifically binds to the E box and confer basal dor promoter activity in either resting or activated T cells. However, USF binding is not the rate-limiting step for the dor promoter activity increment in activated T cells. This is in agreement with our previous conclusion that the increased Ik binding activity at the −378/−374 Ik-binding site triggers the augmentation of dor promoter activity in activated T cells (13Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12854-12860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ik-2 could functionally interact with USF, plasmid pD400, pD400MIK2 (Ik binding site mutated), or pD400ME (E box mutated) was co-transfected into EL-4 cells with expression vectors for mouse Ik-2 and/or human USF-1, which shows over 95% amino acid identity to murine USF-1. As shown in Fig. 5, overexpressed Ik-2 or USF-1 alone elevated the promoter activity of pD400 slightly more than 2-fold or 1-fold, whereas the combined overexpression of Ik-2 and USF-1 resulted in a more than 4-fold activation. The latter activation was abolished either by mutation of the putative Ik-binding site (pD400MIK2) or the E box (pD400ME). In addition, overexpressed Ik-2 could not rescue the promoter activity that was abolished by the E box mutation, indicating that Ik-2 needs to function through the E box-bound USF, which confers the basal dor promoter activity. Similar results were observed in co-transfection assays using Ik-2 and USF-2 (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Ik-2 synergizes with USF in trans-activating the dor promoter via the −378/−374 Ik-binding site and the E box, respectively. To further understand the functional properties of the −378/−374 Ik-binding site, several constructs were generated. Plasmid pD1300IK was created by inserting a duplicate of the Ik-2-responsive element (−400 to −360) upstream of −1300 while silencing the original Ik-2-responsive element by mutating the Ik-binding site at −378 to −374. pD400AS was generated by inserting the Ik-2-responsive element upstream of −360 in the antisense orientation (Fig. 6 A). As shown in Fig. 6 B, although overexpressed Ik-2 enhanced the promoter activity of pD400, pD400AS and pD1300 by about 2-fold in EL-4 cells, the promoter activity of pD1300IK was not affected. These results demonstrate that the −378/−374 Ik-binding site functions in a position-dependent, orientation-independent manner, indicating that the Ik-2-responsive element acts as an upstream promoter element rather than an enhancer for the dorpromoter (18Twyman R.M. Wisden W. Advanced Molecular Biology: A Concise Reference. BIOS Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford, UK1998: 443-458Google Scholar, 19Lewin B. Genes VI. Oxford University Press, New York, NY1997: 811-842Google Scholar). Interestingly, similar results were observed when the Ik-2 treatment was replaced by PHA activation in EL-4 cells (Fig. 6 C), suggesting that the enhanced dor promoter activity in PHA-activated EL-4 cells results from increased binding activity of Ik-2 at the −378/−374 Ik-binding site. Previously, we reported that increased Ik binding activity at an Ik-binding site (−378 to −374) in the mouse dor promoter is required for the enhanced dor promoter activity in PHA-activated EL-4 cells, a mouse T cell line that constitutively expresses DOR. In the present study, we further analyzed the mousedor promoter in EL-4 cells and have demonstrated that Ik-2 homodimers bind to the −378/−374 Ik-binding site and exerts a position-dependent trans-activation effect on thedor promoter. Moreover, an E box (−185 to −180) that binds upstream stimulatory factor is essential for the dorpromoter activity in both resting and PHA-activated T cells. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Ik-2 and USF synergize in trans-activating the dor promoter via the putative Ik-binding site and the E box, respectively. The Ikaros gene encodes a family of hemopoiesis-specific zinc finger transcription factors by means of alternative splicing. Three Ik isoforms, Ik-1, Ik-2, and Ik-3, are capable of binding DNA. Ik-1 and Ik-2 are detected predominantly in the nucleus, whereas Ik-3 is present mainly in the cytoplasm. Interactions between the three DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms generate six homo- and heterodimeric complexes with distinct combinations of two DNA-binding domains that can interact with a range of regulatory sequences with different affinities (16Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 17Sun L. Liu A.P. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 20Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with our observation that Ik-2 homodimers can bind efficiently to the −378/−374 Ik-binding site in the dor promoter, whereas Ik-1 homodimers or Ik-1/Ik-2 heterodimers show very low affinity for the same site (Fig. 2). In addition, although overexpressed Ik-1 exerted no effect on the dor promoter activity in EL-4 cells, the overexpression of Ik-2 elevated the dor promoter activity almost to the level of that activated by PHA (Fig. 1). These results, together with our previous observation that the expression of the nuclear Ik proteins was increased in PHA-activated EL-4 cells (13Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12854-12860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), indicate that the increased Ik binding activity at the −378/−374 Ik-binding site in PHA-activated EL-4 cells is mainly due to the augmented formation of Ik-2 homodimers, which readily bind to the putative Ik-binding site and enhance the dor promoter activity. On the other hand, a USF-binding E box (−185 to −180) is essential for dor promoter activity. The E box mutant exhibited almost total loss of dor promoter activity in both resting and PHA-activated EL-4 cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that the USF-bound E box functions as the basal dor promoter. This proposition is supported by several lines of evidence from other reports. First, USF has been shown to be able to interact with TFIID (21Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 22Sawadogo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11994-12001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increases the rate or stability of TFIID binding (23Bungert J. Kober I. During F. Seifart K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 885-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and stabilize formation of the preinitiation complex (24Carcomo J. Lobos S. Merino A. Buckbinder L. Weinmann R. Natarajan V. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7704-7714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, USF is able to interact with other basal transcription factors, including TAFII55 (25Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), TFII-I (26Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 27Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and transcriptional co-factor PC5 (28Halle J.P. Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Meisterernst M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21307-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Third, the USF-bound E box has been found to function in a manner similar to the initiator element (27Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and to direct transcription in a TATA- and initiator-less promoter (29Li N. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28170-28177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, multiple transcription initiation sites are present within the 40-base pair region immediately downstream of the USF-binding E box in the TATA- and initiator-less dor promoter (30Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Min B.H. Fuchs S.M. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that the E box-bound USF can recruit TFIID and/or other components of the basal transcription machinery to the dor promoter and facilitate the assembly of the preinitiation complex. USF consists of two ubiquitous polypeptides (31Qyang Y.B. Luo X., Lu, T. Ismail P.M. Krylov D. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), USF-1 (43 kDa) and USF-2 (44 kDa), both of which bind the E box (Fig. 4) and interact functionally with Ik-2 in trans-activating the dor promoter (Fig. 5). Interestingly, overexpressed Ik-2 could not rescue the promoter activity that was abolished by the E box mutation, in agreement with the notion that the USF-bound E box may functions as the basal promoter. It was observed that USF expression as well as USF binding activity at the E box basically did not change in PHA-activated EL-4 cells compared with the unstimulated cells (Fig. 4). This indicates that USF binding at the E box is not rate-limiting for thedor promoter activity increment in PHA-activated T cells, consistent with our conclusion that increased binding activity of Ik-2 homodimers triggers the augmentation of the dor promoter activity in PHA-activated EL-4 cells. The −378/−374 Ik-binding site functions in a position-dependent manner (Fig. 6), indicating that the Ik-2-responsive element does not act as an enhancer (18Twyman R.M. Wisden W. Advanced Molecular Biology: A Concise Reference. BIOS Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford, UK1998: 443-458Google Scholar, 19Lewin B. Genes VI. Oxford University Press, New York, NY1997: 811-842Google Scholar) but an upstream promoter element. Although the functional synergy between Ik-2 and USF in trans-activating the dor promoter was obvious in EL-4 cells (Fig. 5) and some other mouse T cell lines (data not shown), no direct interaction between Ik-2 and USF was detected in this study (data not shown). Thus, Ik-2 probably exerts its trans-activation effect on the dor promoter by promoting the assembly of the basal transcription machinery initiated via the E box-bound USF through interaction with components of the preinitiation complex. Collectively, our data support such a model; the USF-bound E box confers the constitutive dor promoter activity in resting T cells, wherein the binding activity at the −378/−374 Ik-binding site is weak (13Sun P. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12854-12860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) because of inadequate Ik-2 homodimers. However, in activated T cells, the augmented expression of nuclear Ik proteins results in increased formation of Ik-2 homodimers, which in turn leads to the increased binding activity at the putative Ik-binding site and enhances the dor promoter activity via functional synergy with the E box-bound USF. T lymphocytes are exposed to endogenous opioid peptides in vivo (32Blalock J.E. Prog. Neuroendocrinimmunol. 1988; 1: 9-12Google Scholar, 33Wesley H.J. Kleiss K.J. Kelley K.W. Wong P.K.Y. Yuen P.H. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because Ik has been reported to set threshold for T-cell activation (34Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B., Ge, Y. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and to play an important role in T-cell homeostasis (35Nichogiannopoulou A. Trevisan M. Friedrich C. Georgopoulos K. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the link between Ik-2 and the transcriptional regulation of the dor gene in T cells implies an active role for endogenous opioids in modulating the functions and homeostasis of T cells in different physiological settings. In addition, as Ik proteins are specific to the hemopoietic system, particularly T cells (16Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 17Sun L. Liu A.P. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar,36Georgopoulos K. Moore D.D. Derfler B. Science. 1992; 258: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), this study also provides insight into the tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of the dor gene.
