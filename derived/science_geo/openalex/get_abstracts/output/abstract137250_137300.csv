https://openalex.org/W1973672022,"Histone acetylation and deacetylation were found to be catalyzed by structurally distinct, multisubunit complexes that mediate, respectively, activation and repression of transcription. ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling, mediated by different multisubunit complexes, was thought to be involved only in transcription activation. Here we report the isolation of a protein complex that contains both histone deacetylation and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activities. The complex contains the histone deacetylases HDAC1/2, histone-binding proteins, the dermatomyositis-specific autoantigen Mi2β, a polypeptide related to the metastasis-associated protein 1, and a novel polypeptide of 32 kDa. Patients with dermatomyositis have a high rate of malignancy. The finding that Mi2β exists in a complex containing histone deacetylase and nucleosome remodeling activities suggests a role for chromatin reorganization in cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2064168721,"Systemic, posttranscriptional silencing of transgenes in Nicotiana benthamiana was initiated in localized regions of the plant by introduction of transgene-homologous DNA fragments, including those without a promoter. Following this initiation step, a sequence-specific signal of gene silencing spread from cells that had received the ectopic DNA via a relay mechanism that employs plasmodesmatal and phloem channels. The nature of this mechanism, the mode of its initiation, and the ability of the signal to move long distances indicate the existence of a sequence-specific signaling mechanism in plants that may have roles in developmental control as well as in protection against transposons and viruses."

The PhoP-PhoQ activated gene, pagP, was identified as important to inducible CAMP resistance and increased acylation of lipid A, the major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. pagP mutants demonstrated increased outer membrane permeability in response to CAMP, supporting the hypothesis that increased lipid A acylation is a CAMP resistance mechanism. Similarly, in response to Mg2+ limited growth, other enteric Gram-negative bacteria demonstrated increased lipid A acylation. Compounds that inhibit the ability to increase lipid A acylation may have utility as new antimicrobial agents."
https://openalex.org/W1983657784,"Ras-related GTPases are positively regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that promote the exchange of GDP for GTP. The crystal structure of the Sec7 domain GEF bound to nucleotide-free ARF1 GTPase has been determined at 2.8 Å resolution and the structure of ARF1 in the GTP-analog form determined at 1.6 Å resolution. The Sec7 domain binds to the switch regions of ARF1 and inserts residues directly into the GTPase active site. The interaction leaves the purine-binding site intact but perturbs the Mg2+ and phosphate groups to promote the dissociation of guanine nucleotides. The structure of ARF1 in the GTP-analog form closely resembles Ras, revealing a substantial rearrangement from the GDP conformation. The transition controls the exposure of the myristoylated N terminus, explaining how ARF GTPases couple the GDP–GTP conformational switch to membrane binding."

The generation of Tg mice expressing selected HIV-1 gene(s) revealed that nef harbors a major disease determinant. The latency and progression (fast/slow) of the disease were strongly correlated with the levels of Tg expression. Nef-expressing Tg thymocytes were activated and alpha-CD3 hyperresponsive with respect to tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates, including LAT and MAPK. The similarity of this mouse model to human AIDS, particularly pediatric AIDS, suggests that Nef may play a critical role in human AIDS, independently of its role in virus replication."

https://openalex.org/W2023565096,"Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is an essential transcription factor in the control of expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB complexes are sequestered in the cytoplasm through interactions with IκBα and other IκB proteins. Extracellular stimuli that activate NF-κB, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), cause rapid phosphorylation of IκBα at serines 32 and 36. The inducible phosphorylation of IκBα is followed by its ubiquitination and degradation, allowing NF-κB complexes to translocate into the nucleus and to activate gene expression. Previously, it has been shown that TNFα as well as other stimuli also lead to the phosphorylation of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB. In this report, we demonstrate that the TNFα-induced phosphorylation of the RelA/p65 subunit occurs on serine 529, which is in the C-terminal (TA1) transactivation domain. Accordingly, the TNFα-induced phosphorylation of Rel/p65 increases NF-κB transcriptional activity but does not affect nuclear translocation or DNA binding affinity.

NF-κB1/Rel transcription factors are key regulators of transcription of a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, growth, differentiation, development, and cell death (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

NF-κB was originally identified as a nuclear factor that binds to the enhancer element of the immunoglobulin kappa light chain gene (4Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). To date, eight members of the NF-κB/Rel proteins have been cloned and characterized. They are c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p50/p105), NF-κB2 (p52/p100), RelA (p65), RelB, and the Drosophila proteins Dorsal, Dif, and Relish (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). These proteins can form homo- or heterodimers through their N-terminal Rel homology domains, which also function in DNA binding and interaction with inhibitor proteins known as IκBs. The prototypical, inducible NF-κB complex is a heterodimer containing p50 and p65. The C-terminal region of p65 contains a potent transactivation domain that is lacking in p50 (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). In most cells, NF-κB is inactive due to its cytoplasmic sequestration through interactions with inhibitor proteins IκBs (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB by a wide variety of stimuli such as mitogens, cytokines, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, viral infection, double-stranded RNA, and UV light involves the dissociation of NF-κB from IκB, allowing the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). There are seven members of the IκB family identified: IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, Bcl3, p105, p100, and IκBε as well asDrosophila IκB protein cactus (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6184-6190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), each of which contains multiple copies of the ankyrin repeat. Stimulation of cells with inducers such as TNFα leads to rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκBα. NF-κB is therefore released and translocates into the nucleus to activate the expression of target genes (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). Early studies implicated IκB phosphorylation as a crucial step for NF-κB activation, and much attention has been focused on the signal transduction pathway involved with induced phosphorylation of IκB. Recently, it was shown that two highly related serine kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, are induced in response to TNFα treatment and phosphorylate IκBα and IkBβ on critical serine residues known to be required for NF-κB activation (8DiDonato J.A.

Signals that induce phosphorylation of IκBs can also cause the phosphorylation of NF-κB proteins (13Naumann M. Scheidereit C.

For example, p50 is hyperphosphorylated in response to phorbol myristate acetate in Jurkat cells (15Li C.H. Korner M. Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In vitro studies suggest that phosphorylation of p50 and p65 enhances NF-κB DNA binding ability (13Naumann M. Scheidereit C.

In vivo, the inducible phosphorylation on NF-κB subunits could also be correlated with dimerization, release from IκBs, nuclear translocation, or activation of transcription function of NF-κB. Recent work by Zhong et al. (18Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) demonstrated that LPS induced the phosphorylation of the p65/RelA subunit on serine 276 and increased its transactivating potential (18Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Consistent with reports of others (16Diehl J.A. Tong W. Sun G. Hannink M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2703-2707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we report here that p65 phosphorylation is rapidly induced upon TNFα stimulation. Using phosphopeptide mapping and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the inducible phosphorylation site as serine 529 in the C-terminal region of p65. A mutant p65 protein that has a serine 529 to alanine substitution cannot be phosphorylated in response to TNFα stimulation when stably expressed in fibroblasts from p65 −/− mice. Our data also demonstrate that inducible phosphorylation on p65 does not affect nuclear translocation or DNA binding ability but functions to increase its transcriptional activity. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cos cells were grown in Iscove's minimal essential medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Stable cell lines that express flag-empty, flag-p65, flag-p65(529A), or flag-p65(276A) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and hygromycin (450 μg/ml). For 32P metabolic labeling, cells were grown in phosphate-free media with 2% serum for 3 h before32P H3PO4 was added. After 3 h of labeling, the cells were stimulated with TNFα (30 ng/ml) and harvested in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with p65 antibody, and the precipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Phosphorylated p65 was excised after autoradiography and digested with trypsin or V8 protease (Sigma). The resulting peptides were resuspended in Laemmli SDS loading buffer and resolved on three layer Tris-Tricine gels (19Schägger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 3–10 days. For phosphoamino acid analysis, excised phosphorylated p65 from the nitrocellulose was incubated with 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 1 h. The resulting amino acids were lyophilized and applied to thin-layer cellulose plates with cold PAA standards (1.0 mg/ml each phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine). Two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out for 25 min at 1.5 kV in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid:acetic acid:H2O = 50:156:1794) followed by 12 min at 1.3 kV in pH 3.5 buffer (pyridine:acetic acid:H2O = 1:10:189). Cold phosphoamino acids were detected by spraying the plates with 0.25% ninhydrin. Hot phosphoamino acids were visualized by exposing the plates to x-ray films at −80 °C for a week. F-p65, F539, F534, FΔ534, and F521 were made by cloning different PCR products into the HindIII and EcoRV sites of pFlag-CMV-2 expression vector. The template for the PCR reactions is CMV-p65. The 5′ primer is 1) 5′ GAC AAG CTT GAC GAA CTG TTC CCC CTC AT 3′.

F-529A, F-276A, and F-529E were made by site-directed mutagenesis using two-staged PCR. The template for the first round PCR is CMV-p65. The primers are: 1, 2, and 7) 5′ CTT CAT CTC CTG CAA GGA GGC C 3′; 8) 5′ GGC CTC CTT GCA GGA GAT GAA G 3′ (F-529A); 9) 5′ CTT CAT CTC CTT CAA GGC C 3′; 10) 5′ GGC CTC CTTGAA GAT GAA G 3′ (F-529E); 11) 5′ GCG GCG GCC TGC CGA CCG GGA G 3′; and 12) 5′ CTC CCG GTC GGC AGG CCG CCG C 3′(F-276A) (boldface type indicates the nucleotides that encode mutated amino acids). The products of second round PCR were cloned into the HindIII and EcoRV sites of the Flag-CMV-2 vector. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (20Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA were performed as previously detailed (21Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S.

The DNA probe (5′CAGGGCTGGGGATTCCCCATCTCCACAGTTTCACTTC 3′) contains the NF-κB binding site (underlined) from the MHC class IH-2κ b gene. For Western blotting, a total of 50 μg of whole cell lysates or nuclear extracts were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and blots were blocked with 5% dry milk and then probed with anti-p65 antibodies (Rockland, Inc., Boyertown, PA). After the blots were incubated with secondary antibody, ECL reagents (Amersham) were used to detect the proteins. Cells were transfected using lipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) (22Wang D. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2291-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For TNFα induction, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% serum for 36 h after incubation with LipofectAMINE/DNA mixture. TNFα (10 ng/ml) was added to the cells 6–10 h before harvest. Luciferase assays were performed by methods described elsewhere (23Cogswell P.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For stable transfection, a vector (pHygro) encoding the hygromycin resistance protein was cotransfected with flag expression vectors. The individual stable clones were selected by adding 450 μg/ml hygromycin to the media. The expression of p65 proteins was quantified by Western blot method. Although inducible phosphorylation on IκBs plays an important role in NF-κB activation, some NF-κB/Rel proteins are also inducibly phosphorylated (13Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 14Li C. Dai R. Chen E. Longo D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30089-30092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Li C.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2703-2707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we found that p65 phosphorylation is rapidly induced upon TNFα stimulation in HeLa cells. After treatment with TNFα for 10 min, whole cell lysates from 32P metabolically labeled HeLa cells were generated and immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 antibodies. A TNFα-induced phosphoprotein of 65 kDa was detected following electrophoresis (Fig. 1, upper panel). The identity of this protein as p65 was confirmed by competition with the peptide against which the anti-p65 antibody was raised (data not shown). The levels of p65 protein did not change in response to TNFα (Fig. 1,lower panel); therefore, quantitative changes in p65 cannot explain the increase in phosphorylation. Additionally, a level of basal phosphorylation of p65 in untreated cells was also detected. Immunoprecipitated p65 from untreated cells or cells treated with TNFα for 10 min was isolated, hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl, and subjected to two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis. The inducible p65 phosphorylation was exclusively on serine residues (Fig. 2).Figure 2Inducible phosphorylation of p65 is on serine residue(s). Immunoprecipitated p65 from untreated or TNFα-treated HeLa cells was hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl. The resulting amino acids were separated on two-dimensional thin layer cellulose plates.

The 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine a potential function for inducible phosphorylation of p65 in NF-κB activation, it was important for us to identify the site of phosphorylation. We used high resolution Tris-Tricine gel electrophoresis to fractionate the proteolyzed phospho-p65 from untreated HeLa cells or from cells treated with TNFα for 10 min. Trypsin digestion generated a major phosphopeptide of approximately 5 kDa in both untreated and TNFα-treated cells (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that inducible phosphorylation occurs on the same peptide as occurs in basal phosphorylation, and possibly on the same serine residue(s). To determine the relative position of the phosphopeptide in p65, the tryptic digestion product was subjected to another round of immunoprecipitation with either C-terminal or N-terminal p65 antibody. The 5-kDa peptide could be specifically recognized by a C-terminal p65 antibody but not by an N-terminal p65 antibody (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, the phosphopeptide is at the C terminus of p65. Since trypsin cleaves after Lys and Arg residues and since the phosphopeptide is approximately 5 kDa, it was reasonable to propose that the target of phosphorylation was in the last 42 amino acids, C-terminal to Arg-509 (Fig. 3 C). The other phosphopeptides were likely to result from partial digestion, since their presence was dependent on the time of protease digestion (data not shown). Digestion of 32P-labeled p65 from untreated cells and cells treated with V8 yielded a major phosphopeptide of approximately 4 kDa (Fig. 3 B). This peptide could also be recognized by a C-terminal p65 antibody (data not shown). V8 cleaves the peptide bond after Glu; therefore, the only way this protease can generate a 4-kDa peptide at the C terminus of p65 was by cleaving at Glu-498 and Glu-532 (Fig. 3 C). The overlapping region of the tryptic and V8 phosphopeptides is from Arg-509 to Glu-532, and in this region only one serine, Ser-529, is found (Fig. 3 C). The results of phosphopeptide mapping also indicated that the TNFα-inducible phosphorylation site of p65 is the same as the basal phosphorylation site (data not shown). These data indicate that serine 529 is the major site of phosphorylation on p65 in response to TNFα stimulation. To confirm that serine 529 of p65 is the phosphorylation site, we therefore made a number of expression vectors encoding flag-tagged, C-terminal truncated p65 mutants (Fig. 4 A) to determine if these proteins can be phosphorylated when expressed in Cos cells. After metabolically labeling the transfected cells with [32P]orthophosphate, whole cell lysates were made and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the flag antibody. As expected, flag-tagged wild-type p65 (F-p65) was phosphorylated (Fig. 4 B) as were F539 and F534 which express flag-tagged truncated p65 proteins from amino acids 2–539 and 534, respectively. FΔ534, which encodes the same length p65 protein as F534 except has a serine to alanine substitution at 529, cannot be phosphorylated. In addition, the mutant F521 lacks the last 30 amino acids of p65 and was incapable of being phosphorylated. Immunoblotting results (not shown) demonstrated that F521 expressed the highest amount of protein while F-p65 expressed the least. The higher levels of phosphorylation of F539 and F534 are due to higher levels of expression of these proteins relative to F-p65. It is obvious that whenever serine 529 was deleted or mutated, the mutant p65 was no longer phosphorylated, suggesting serine 529 of p65 (Fig. 4 A, underlined) is the target for phosphorylation. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of p65 in Cos cells was largely constitutive, although some weak induction by TNFα was observed. This result suggests that the kinase that phosphorylates p65 has the potential to function constitutively, at least in Cos cells (see “Discussion”). To demonstrate that serine 529 is the TNFα-induced phosphorylation site, we made another flag-tagged p65 mutant (F-529A). F-529A expresses full-length p65 but has an alanine to serine substitution at 529. Since in Cos cells, transiently transfected p65 has high basal phosphorylation (Fig. 4), we stably expressed F-p65 and F-529A into p65 −/− embryonic fibroblasts. The stable cells that contain the flag empty vector, F-p65 or F-529A, were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with TNFα for 10 min. After cells were harvested, the whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with flag antibody. The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 5, upper panel). The results demonstrate that TNFα-induced phosphorylation only occurred with wild-type p65 (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4, lower bands, upper panel), while F-529A exhibited no detectable phosphorylation in response to TNFα induction (Fig. 5,lanes 5 and 6, upper panel). Immunoblotting analysis indicated that the lack of phosphorylation of F-529A was not due to reduced protein levels (Fig. 5, lower panel). Recently, it was reported that serine 276 of p65 was phosphorylated by protein kinase A after LPS induction (18Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that different inducers target distinct sites on p65 for phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we made a flag-tagged p65 mutant (F-276A) that has an alanine to serine substitution at 276. When stably expressed in p65 −/− cells, this mutant still can be phosphorylated in response to TNFα induction (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and 8, upper panel), suggesting that TNFα- and LPS-induced phosphorylation sites on p65 are distinct. It is noted that high levels of expression of the alanine 276 mutant leads to enhanced basal phosphorylation, similar to results obtained in Fig. 4 B. To determine the possible role for TNFα-induced phosphorylation relative to p65 function, we utilized the stable cell lines expressing F-p65 or F-529A. The cells were treated with TNFα for various times, and nuclear extracts were collected for EMSA (Fig. 6 A, upper panel) and Western blot analysis with p65 antibody (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). The EMSA experiment identified two complexes that bind to the NF-κB site-containing probe. The lower complex can be totally supershifted by a p50 antibody, suggesting it is the p50·p50 homodimer. The upper complex (asterisk) can be almost totally supershifted with a p65 antibody, suggesting this complex contains the p65 subunit (Fig. 6 B). The relatively weak supershift by the p50 antibody is likely due to the poor ability of this antibody to recognize the p50·p65 heterodimer. It is obvious that both wild-type and mutant p65 rapidly translocated to nucleus after TNFα induction and remained there for at least 4 h (Fig. 6 A). Additionally, there was no defect in DNA binding for TNFα-induced F-529A. These results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of p65 on serine 529 does not control nuclear translocation or DNA binding affinity. Previously, it has been shown that the C terminus of p65, which contains serine 529, functions as a strong transactivation domain when fused to heterologous DNA binding domains (24Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on serine 529 may, therefore, regulate the transcriptional activity of p65. To test this possibility, the stable cells expressing flag empty vector, wild-type p65, or alanine 529 were transiently transfected with a 3XκBLuc reporter, which contains three copies of κB binding site. To assay transcription function, TNFα was added to the cells, and whole cell lysates were made for luciferase assays. As shown in Fig. 6 C, TNFα activated 3XκBLuc activity in the cells expressing wild-type p65 but had little or no effect in the cells expressing mutant (alanine 529) p65, indicating that serine 529 of p65 is the target for TNFα and that the inducible phosphorylation on this site increases p65 transcriptional activity. The higher basal transcription in the cells expressing F-p65 or F-529A compared with the cells expressing flag empty vector may be due to nuclear NF-κB in the untreated cells. This result also excluded the possibility that F-529A acts as a dominant negative of other members of the NF-κB family. The NF-κB responsive human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter was activated by TNFα in the F-p65 cells but not in the F-529A-expressing cells (data not shown). Thus, mutation of serine 529 significantly inhibits the ability of TNFα to activate transient NF-κB-dependent transcription. To further confirm that phosphorylation on serine 529 increases p65 transcription activity, we made F-529E, which has a glutamic acid substitution at position 529 to mimic constitutively phosphorylated p65. For unknown reasons, we were unable to stably express F-529E in the p65 null cell line. In transient transfection assays, F-529E activated 3XκBLuc significantly better than F-p65 and F-529A (Fig. 6 D). This result indicates that a mutation that mimics phosphorylation at position 529 leads to constitutively enhanced p65 transcriptional activity. Stimulation of cells with TNFα leads to phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and to subsequent translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus to activate gene-specific transcription. In this paper, and consistent with previous reports (16Diehl J.A. Tong W. Sun G. Hannink M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2703-2707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we have shown that TNFα also induces phosphorylation on the p65 subunit of NF-κB. Phosphopeptide mapping of TNFα-induced phosphorylated p65 indicates that phosphorylation occurs exclusively on serine 529. By the use of p65 −/− embryonic fibroblasts stably expressing wild-type p65 or the non-phosphorylated mutant p65, we conclude that TNFα-induced phosphorylation on p65 does not affect its nuclear translocation or DNA binding abilities but increases its transcriptional potential. Transient transfection experiments with F-529E also indicated that phosphorylation on serine 529 increases p65 transactivation ability. RelA/p65 contains at least two strong transactivation domains in its C-terminal region (24Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 25Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1666-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serine 529 is within the TA1 domain, which comprises the last 30 amino acids of p65. TA1 belongs to the class of acidic activators; thus, it is not surprising that the additional negative charge by the phosphate group at serine 529 increases its transcriptional potential. The C-terminal transcriptional activation domain of p65 interacts with TBP, TFIIB, and coactivators such as CBP and p300 (26Schmitz M.L. Stelzer G. Altmann H. Meisterernst M. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7219-7226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J.

A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine if the phosphorylation on serine 529 potentiates any of these interactions. Also, it remains possible that phosphorylation may involve interaction with other transcription factors and with the ability of NF-κB to disrupt chromatin. Thus, the inducible phosphorylation of p65 may have different effects on different promoters. The most widely studied mechanism for inducible NF-κB activation is the phosphorylation of IκBs on serines located in the N-terminal region of the proteins (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). Different inducers converge on this step that involves IKK activation, which subsequently causes degradation of IκBs and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). Our data and those of others show that there is a second level of regulation on NF-κB activity: modulation of p65 transactivation potential by additional phosphorylation events. Schmits et al. (17Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) showed that phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of a defined region within the TA2 domain (90 amino acids adjacent to TA1 domain) were stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate treatment of HeLa cells. Recently, Zhonget al. (18Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) observed that upon LPS stimulation, the transcriptional activity of p65 was increased after phosphorylation on serine 276, which is in the Rel homology domain of p65. Importantly, we found that a mutant p65 protein with an alanine to serine substitution at position 276 can still be phosphorylated upon TNFα treatment (Fig. 5). Therefore, it is possible that different inducers can activate different kinases to phosphorylate p65 at distinct sites to modulate its transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation of p65 at serine 276 enhances the ability of this transcription factor to interact with the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 (29Zhong H. Voll R. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Whether these phosphorylation events have the same functional outcome or whether they may lead to distinct functions is presently unclear. Recent data from our laboratory (30Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and others (31Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y.Q. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18306-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrate that several inducers can control the transcriptional function of NF-κB, independent of induced nuclear translocation. How does TNFα induce phosphorylation of p65? TNFα activates JNK and p38 MAP kinases and previous studies indicated that both SEK/JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways are involved in NF-κB regulation. It has been reported that JNK can physically associate with c-Rel and activate human immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeat and Il-2Rα promoters (32Meyer C.F. Wang X. Chang C. Templeton D. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8971-8976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, whether JNK causes p65 phosphorylation is yet to be investigated. Bayaert et al. (33Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) found that p38 MAP kinase pathway was required for transcriptional induction mediated by NF-κB while having no effect on nuclear translocation or DNA binding of NF-κB. Recently, Vanden Berghe and co-workers (34Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmits M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) showed that p38 and ERK pathways target the transactivation domain of p65 in response to TNFα. All these data suggest that JNK or p38 MAP kinase pathways constitute a second level of regulation of NF-κB activation by modulation of transcription function. Whether JNK or p38 can phosphorylate p65 directly or whether they control other kinases to phosphorylate p65 remains unknown. In our studies, we found that SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, did not inhibit TNFα-induced p65 phosphorylation (data not shown). Therefore, JNK or p38 pathways may cause phosphorylation of a distinct component of the transcription pathway to enhance p65 transactivation function. Recently, it was reported that casein kinase II can phosphorylate the p65 subunit and that casein kinase II is associated with p65 in vivo (35Bird T.A. Schooley K. Dower S.K. Hagen H. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32606-32612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). How casein kinase II could be modulated to induce the potential phosphorylation of p65 is presently unknown. Transiently transfected p65 activates κB-dependent gene expression without TNFα induction (Fig. 6 D and data not shown). One explanation for this is that in transient transfection experiments, cells cannot make enough IκB protein to keep p65 in cytoplasm. Also considering that transiently transfected p65 has high basal phosphorylation on serine 529 (Fig. 4 B), it is possible that the kinase that phosphorylates p65 is constitutively active. This kinase may phosphorylate p65 only when it is released from IκB (for example, following IκB degradation or when p65 is overexpressed), appearing to function as an inducible kinase. The identification of the kinase that directly phosphorylates serine 529 of p65 will provide new insight into mechanisms whereby TNFα controls NF-κB activity. Such a kinase activity may prove to be a useful target in treating diseases associated with dysregulation of NF-κB activity. We thank Dr. Tim Finco for help in initiating this work and for encouragement, Dr. Shelley Earp and Ruth Dy for advice and technical assistance with the phosphoamino acid analysis, and Dr. Denis Guttridge for critical reading of the manuscript. We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Amer Beg for kindly providing p65 null fibroblasts."

We have found a single Aplysia CREB1 gene homologous to both mammalian CREB and CREM and have characterized in the sensory neurons that mediate gill-withdrawal reflex the expression and function of the three proteins that it encodes: CREB1a, CREB1b, and CREB1c. CREB1a is a transcriptional activator that is both necessary and, upon phosphorylation, sufficient for long-term facilitation. CREB1b is a repressor of long-term facilitation. Cytoplasmic CREB1c modulates both the short- and long-term facilitation. Thus, in the sensory neurons, CREB1 encodes a critical regulatory unit converting short- to long-term synaptic changes."

https://openalex.org/W2044162906,"We have identified a novel member of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor family, which we have termed AcPL. In transient transfection assays, we were unable to demonstrate a role for AcPL in IL-1-induced activation of NFkappaB. Interleukin-18 (interferon-gamma-inducing factor) is another member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, and it has recently been shown that IL-18 has a weak affinity for IL-1R-rp1. We examined whether AcPL might function alone or in concert with IL-1R-rp1 to mediate IL-18 signaling. We found that both IL-1R-rp1 and AcPL expression were required for induction of NFkappaB activity and for activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in response to IL-18. Furthermore, a dominant negative version of AcPL specifically inhibited IL-18 signaling. In vitro immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that AcPL alone was unable to bind IL-18 with any appreciable affinity. We propose that although IL-1R-rp1 binds the cytokine, IL-1R-rp1 and AcPL proteins are both required for IL-18 signaling, analogous to the requirement for both IL-1R and IL-1RAcP in IL-1-mediated responses."
https://openalex.org/W2161758212,"The insulin/IGF receptor homolog DAF-2 regulates the aging in C. elegans. Decreasing daf-2 activity causes fertile adults to remain active much longer than normal and to live more than twice as long. A more severe decrease in daf-2 function causes young larvae to enter a state of diapause rather than progressing to adulthood. We have asked which cells require daf-2 gene activity in order for the animal to develop to adulthood and to age normally. We found that daf-2 functions cell nonautonomously in both processes. Our findings imply that the life span of C. elegans is determined by a signaling cascade in which the DAF-2 receptor acts in multiple cell lineages to regulate the production or activity of a secondary signal (or signals), which, in turn, controls the growth and longevity of individual tissues in the animal."

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)1 is an inducible transcription factor that plays an essential role in the regulation of gene expression in response to inflammatory stimuli (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

It is composed of members of the Rel family (p50, p52, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and RelB), which share a region of homology known as the Rel homology domain capable of directing DNA binding and mediating dimerization. In many cells, NF-κB is found in an inactive form in the cytoplasm bound to an inhibitory protein, IκB. In response to many activating signals, the inhibitor is degraded by the proteasome and NF-κB translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with transcription coactivator proteins to activate target genes. CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its structural homolog p300 are transcriptional coactivators of the p65 subunit (4Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Choi S.-S. Im S.-Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10813-10834Google Scholar). Glucocorticoid hormones modulate the expression of a variety of genes associated with inflammatory responses by binding to a widely expressed intracellular receptor (GR). The GR is a member of the nuclear receptor family of proteins, which have a conserved modular architecture consisting of three functional domains: a DNA-binding domain, transcriptional activating domain, and a ligand-binding domain (7Mangelsdorf D.J.

Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 391-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation by this class of receptors requires that part of the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (called AF2) undergo a conformational change upon binding of ligand. This enables the receptors to bind a series of coactivator proteins, such as SRC-1 and CBP (9Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Induction of gene expression by GR may contribute to the effects of glucocorticoid hormones, but recent findings suggest that DNA binding by GR is not required for some of the physiologic functions of the receptor (10Reichardt H.M.

Previous studies found that activation of NF-κB is inhibited by glucocorticoid-induced expression of the inhibitor, IκBα, which suggested an explanation for how these steroids suppress an inflammatory response (12Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar, 13Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). However, in endothelial cells (14Brostjan C. Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Stroka D. Soares M. Bach F.H. Winkler H. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 3836-3844PubMed Google Scholar), as well as some other cells, glucocorticoid-mediated repression of NF-κB activity does not involve induction of IκBα synthesis. In these cells, the GR does not inhibit nuclear accumulation of NF-κB, or inhibit DNA binding, suggesting that GR blocks NF-κB-mediated transactivation. Analysis of cell lines stably expressing a fusion protein between the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein and the transactivating region of p65 revealed that expression of the GAL4-dependent reporter gene was strongly suppressed by the action of the dexamethasone (16De Bosscher K.

This suggests that reduction of p65-dependent gene expression by the activated GR involves interference with transactivation. Because transactivation by p65 involves both CBP (4Gerritsen M.E.

We find that GR-mediated repression of p65-dependent gene expression results, at least in part, from competition for a limiting amount of these versatile transcriptional coactivators. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were obtained as described previously (17Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Collins T. J. Exp.

In studies with the GRE-NFκB reporter construct, bovine aortic endothelial cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE and OptiMem (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, prior to a medium exchange. Cells were harvested the next day and lysed, and luciferase assays performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).

CBP regions 1–100, 1–771, 706–1069, 1069–1892, and 1892–2441 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pGex vectors as described previously (4Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J.

First, a GRE-CAT construct was provided by Dr. Robert Scheinman (University of Colorado, Denver, CO) and consists of two GRE sites in a minimal TATA box containing E1B promoter (18Scheinman R.I.

The isolated NF-κB promoter-CAT reporter contains two NF-κB elements in a minimal TATA box containing promoter derived from the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 promoter (17Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). To create the GRE-NFκB reporter construct, the following oligonucleotides were synthesized: oligonucleotide 1, 5′-GATCCTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGATGATCATGGGAAATT CCTC-3′ and oligonucleotide 2, 5′-GATCCGAGAATTTCCCATGATCATCTAGAACATCCTGTACAG-3′. The oligonucleotides were phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated into the BglII site of an SV40 minimal promoter-luciferase reporter vector, pGL3 Promoter (Promega). Fragments of the CBP coding sequence were subcloned in-frame into pGEX vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α (4Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J.

Coomassie Blue stains were done to determine equivalent protein concentration. The mCBP GST fusion constructs were immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose and washed, and bound proteins were incubated with 100 μl of GR overexpressed whole cell extracts. Samples were washed several times with 150 mm cell lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, eluted, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Eluted proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-GR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

Cell. 1998; 1: 227-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (364) Google Scholar). To determine whether CBP limits expression of GR and p65, we examined the effect of overexpression of CBP on the expression of reporters withisolated recognition elements in transient transfection experiments. GRE and κB promoter-reporter constructs were activated severalfold by GR and p65, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). Cotransfection with CBP stimulated expression of the reporters 5–10-fold above the levels seen with the transcriptional activators alone. SRC-1 modulates ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of estrogen, thyroid hormone, and retinoic acid receptors (21Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) and NF-κB-dependent expression of an artificial κB-dependent reporter construct (6Na S.-Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.-J. Choi S.-S. Im S.-Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10813-10834Google Scholar). Coactivator overexpression studies were also performed to verify that SRC-1 limits expression of GR-dependent gene expression and that SRC-1 modulates p65-dependent expression of an authentic NF-κB-dependent promoter. GRE and κB promoter-reporter constructs were activated severalfold by GR and p65, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). Cotransfection with SRC-1 stimulated expression of the reporters 5-fold above the levels seen with the transcriptional activators alone. Control studies demonstrate that overexpressed CBP had no effect on minimal promoter-reporter constructs and did not increase production of p65 or GR from the corresponding expression constructs (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that overexpression of CBP or SRC-1 increases both p65 and GR-dependent gene expression and suggests that the coactivators are present in limiting amounts. To compete effectively with p65 for CBP, GR should interact with CBP. Previous studies indicated that binding sites for the thyroid hormone, estrogen, and retinoic acid receptors mapped to the N-terminal 100 amino acids of CBP (19Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Sheng-Cai L. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). To investigate a direct interaction between GR and CBP, a series of fragments of the coactivator were bacterially expressed as GST fusion proteins (4Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 94: 2927-2932Crossref Scopus (711) Google Scholar) and tested for interaction with the GR. The receptor interacted with the N-terminal 1–771 region of CBP, as well as with the 1069–1892 region of the coactivator (Fig. 2). Binding between the transcriptional activators and CBP was specific because no interactions were observed either with GST alone or with several other regions of CBP. Further mapping of the N-terminal interaction site revealed that GR bound to the 100–446 region of CBP (Fig. 2 and data not shown) and not to the N-terminal 100 amino acids of CBP, similar to many of the other nuclear receptors (19Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Sheng-Cai L. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). If either CBP or SRC-1 function as signal integrators for the NF-κB and GR pathways, we would expect mutual transcriptional interference between these two signal-dependent activators. Using transient transfection assays, p65-mediated transcriptional activation of either E-selectin-promoter reporter constructs (Fig. 3 A) or an isolated NF-κB element-reporter (data not shown) are repressed by dexamethasone-induced activation of GR in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–6). Control studies demonstrate that overexpressed GR did not decrease production of p65 from the corresponding expression constructs (Fig. 3 A, inset). Parallel transfection studies demonstrate that GR-dependent gene expression is repressed by p65 (Fig. 3,B and C, lanes 3–7). Thus p65-mediated transcriptional activation was repressed by GR, and GR-dependent gene expression was repressed by p65, consistent with previous reports (18Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.-A. ver der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possibility suggested by the preceding findings is that the formation of complexes between either p65 or GR and the coactivators would reduce the amount of coactivator available for transcriptional activation. If competition for limiting amounts of CBP or SRC-1 account for the inhibitory effect of GR, then increased levels of the coactivators should restore or rescue p65-dependent gene expression. Indeed, the inhibitory effect of GR on p65-dependent gene expression was completely abolished by cotransfection of vectors expressing CBP, but not by a comparable amount of empty expression vector (Fig. 3 A, comparelanes 7 and 8). The inhibitory effect of p65 on GR-dependent gene expression was eliminated by expression of CBP, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6–9). In a similar manner, the suppression of p65 on GR-dependent gene expression was significantly decreased by SRC-1 (Fig. 3 C, compare lane 7 with lanes 8 and 9). Control studies demonstrated that CBP or SRC-1 overexpression did not significantly alter levels of either p65 (Fig. 3, A, B, and C, insets) or GR (data not shown). Additionally, overexpression of an irrelevant transcriptional activator or mutated forms of CBP did not result in rescue, and overexpression of CBP did not modify the amount or composition of nuclear NF-κB complexes (data not shown). Collectively, these functional studies demonstrate that CBP and SRC-1 are limiting for both p65- and GR-dependent transactivation and that the coactivators can rescue the repressive interaction between p65 and the GR. The previous functional studies suggest that competition between p65 and the GR for limiting amounts of coactivator accounts for the antagonistic interactions between distinct signaling pathways. A prediction of this concept is that when these activators are bound to distinct elements in the same promoter (in cis), they should maintain their ability to recruit coactivators and activate transcription rather than antagonize the process. To test this prediction, a minimal promoter-CAT construct containing a combination of an isolated κB and a GRE site was evaluated for its responsiveness to p65 and the activated GR. At low levels of added activators, the promoter containing both the GR and κB binding sites responded weakly to each of the transcription factors (Fig. 4 lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Addition of both p65 and GR stimulated expression of the reporter construct about 2-fold. The small fold stimulation could be increased by overexpression of CBP or SRC-1 (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8, respectively). Notably, when both coactivators are added, the activity of the reporter gene is increased in a synergistic manner (Fig. 4 B, lane 9), consistent with the model that the coactivators are limiting the activity of these transcription factors. Thus simultaneous activation of the GR and nuclear accumulation of p65 does not always result in inhibition of reporter gene expression. From these studies we suggest that GR-mediated repression of p65-dependent gene expression results from competition for the transcriptional coactivators CBP and SRC-1. This could be the result of a simple titration of a limiting amount of coactivator, as has been described in multiple settings with a variety of other transcriptional activators (19Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Sheng-Cai L. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with recent findings that the levels of p300 are limiting relative to those of p65 (26Hottigen M.O. Felzien L.K. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3124-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and that developmental processes are sensitive to the overall gene dosage of the CBP homolog, p300 (27Yao T.-P. Oh S.P.

Additionally, the dependence on coactivators may reflect more subtle mechanisms affecting the interaction between the transcription factor and the coactivator. Recently, evidence has been presented that hormone-activated nuclear receptors prevent c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation by blocking the induction of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase-signaling cascade (28Caelles C. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Munoz A. Genes Dev. 1998; 11: 3351-3364Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation step is a prerequisite for the transcription factor to interact with CBP. p65 interaction with CBP is also regulated by phosphorylation. Protein kinase A stimulates p65 transcriptional activation, in part, by promoting an interaction with CBP/p300 (29Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Additionally, the p38 and MAP kinase pathways increase p65 transactivation mediated by tumor necrosis factor (30Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.I. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). It is possible that several of these phosphorylation events facilitate CBP binding and are decreased by activated GR. Decreased phosphorylation of p65 would constitute an additional overlapping mechanism to blunt NF-κB-dependent action by reducing the amount of competent NF-κB complex capable of competing for and interacting with CBP. Because many of the large class of genes encoding inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules are NF-κB-dependent (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar), coactivator-mediated signal integration could explain, at least in part, the profound effects of glucocorticoids on suppressing immune and inflammatory responses. The extent of the inhibition would depend upon the abundance of the transcriptional activators, the level of the coactivator, and the relative affinity of the transcription factor for the coactivator."

The secretory and the endocytic pathways of eukaryotic cells are organized in several membrane-bound compartments connected by vesicular traffic. During vesicular transport, cytosolic coat components are recruited on a donor compartment in order to form a vesicle that buds and specifically docks and fuses with the acceptor compartment. The interaction of coat components with specific sorting determinants in the cytoplasmic domain of membrane proteins induces their clustering in the transport vesicle (reviewed in Refs. 1Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar and 2Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). A typical example is provided by the clathrin-coated vesicles that mediate either the endocytosis of transmembrane receptors or the sorting from the trans-Golgi network (TGN)1 of membrane proteins destined to endosomes/lysosomes (reviewed in Refs.3Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 4Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell.

The TGN-derived and plasma membrane-derived vesicles contain distinct, heterotetrameric adaptor complexes, AP-1 and AP-2 respectively. In vitro, both AP-1 and AP-2 bind cytoplasmic domains of membrane receptors and interact with the tyrosine- or di-leucine-based sorting determinants (6Heilker R. Manning-Krieg U. Zuber J.F. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) known to be important for the endocytosis or endosomal/lysosomal targeting of membrane proteins (reviewed in Sandoval and Bakke (7Sandoval I.V.

Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and AP-1-coated buds (9Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) whose functions in vesicular transport are still unclear, are also present on membranes of early endosomes. Early electron microscopic studies have illustrated that the TGN-derived clathrin-coated vesicles mediate the transport of the mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) to endosomal compartments (reviewed in Kornfeld and Mellman (3Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). The proper lysosomal targeting of their bound acid hydrolases requires the presence of tyrosine-based and di-leucine-based motifs in their cytoplasmic domains (10Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J.

Some other membrane proteins such as the lysosomal-associated membrane proteins (LAMP I, LAMP II, or lgp 120), or the lysosomal integral membrane proteins (LIMP I, LIMP II) are also sorted in the TGN and follow an intracellular route to endosomes/lysosomes (reviewed in Refs.3Kornfeld S.

By analogy with the MPRs, it has been proposed that their lysosomal targeting could involve an AP-1-dependent pathway. The presence of LAMP I in AP-1-coated structures may suggest that their exit from the TGN, like that of the MPRs, indeed depends on such a pathway (18Höning S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, other membrane proteins may follow a different route. The lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP) precursor, for example, has been proposed to be transported from the TGN to the cell surface and then endocytosed for subsequent transport to lysosomes (21Braun M. Waheed A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3633-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Its AP-2-dependent endocytosis is also mediated by a tyrosine-based sorting motif (22Peters C. Braun M. Weber B. Wendland M. Schmidt B. Pohlmann R. Waheed A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3497-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). During the past years, the AP-3 adaptor-like complex has been characterized (for review see Odorizzi et al. (23Odorizzi G. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 282-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar)). Its δ, β3, μ3, and ς3 subunits are homologous to their counterparts in AP-1 and AP-2 (24Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S.

More recently, it has been demonstrated that the yeast AP-3 complex plays a major role in the selective transport of the alkaline phosphatase (33Cowles C.R. Odorizzi G. Payne G.S. Emr S.D.

We have shown in previous studies that the MPRs are part of the key components required for the efficient translocation of cytosolic AP-1 onto membranes (9Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro, MPR expression in MPR-negative cells correlates to some extent AP-1 recruitment on membranes. In this study, we report that the overexpression of chimeric proteins made of the cytoplasmic domains of LAMP I, LIMP II, and LAP fused to the luminal and transmembrane domains of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) envelope glycoprotein gpI, used as a reporter, is unable to promote AP-1 recruitment onto membranes. In contrast, the overexpression of gpI-LAMP I and gpI-LIMP II, but not that of the MPRs or gpI-LAP, promotes the recruitment of AP-3 on perinuclear membranes. This recruitment requires the presence of a tyrosine- or a di-leucine-based sorting motif in their cytoplasmic domains. Furthermore, inhibition of the synthesis of the μ3 subunit of AP-3 results in the selective misrouting of LAMP I and LIMP II to the plasma membrane. We conclude that, in mammalian cells, AP-3 is essential for the proper intracellular targeting of LAMP I and LIMP II to lysosomes. All reagents were of analytical grade. Brefeldin A was from Sigma. DOTAP reagent was from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). [35S]methionine/cysteine (EXPRESS) was from NEN Life Science Products. 30% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.8% (w/v) bis-acrylamide solution was from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and streptavidin beads were from Pierce. HeLa and NRK cells (American Type Tissue Culture collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in α-minimum essential medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. For transfections, cells were split and grown onto coverslips the day before. Transient expression using calcium phosphate transfection was as described previously (42Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For expression using the vaccinia virus, the protocol was as described previously (39Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22552-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were first infected for 30 min with the vT7 recombinant virus and then transfected with the different cDNAs using DOTAP reagent. The cells were allowed to express the different chimeric proteins for 2 h in the presence of hydroxyurea to avoid cytophatic effects. Under those conditions, the bulk of the expressed lysosomal membrane proteins fills perinuclear compartments and has not reached the lysosomes. The cDNA encoding the signal peptide and the luminal domain of HA fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the murine CI-MPR fusion protein was constructed and inserted into the pGEM-2 vector as described previously (39Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22552-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the different gpI chimeric proteins were all constructed from the pGEM1 vector containing theXbaI-HindIII fragment of the most truncated version of gpI (mutant gpI-Δ1) (42Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To generate by PCR the gpI-LIMP II chimera using the previous vector as a template, the following primers were used: forward primer (primer gpI-1) 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGGGACAGTTAATAAACCTGTGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCAAGCTTTTAGGTCCGTATGAGGGGTGCCCTTTCATCTGCAGTTCCCTCATCCGTAGACCCCTGTCCTCGAGCCGTACAGATTAAAAATATTACGAG-3′. Introduction into the primers of XbaI and HindIII sites in the forward and reverse primers, respectively, allowed the cloning of the polymerase chain reaction product on the same sites into the pSFFV6 and pGEM1 vectors (42Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The same stategy was used to obtain the LIMP II LG mutant except that the reverse primer was 5′-GCAAGCTTTTAGGTCCGTATCCGGGGTGCCCTTTCATCTGCAGTTCCCTCATCCGTAGACCCCTGTCCTCGAGCCG TACAGATTAAAAATATTACGAG-3′. To generate by polymerase chain reaction the gpI-Lamp1, gpI-Lamp1 YA mutant, and gpI-LAP, the following primers were used. In every case the forward primer was the gpI-1 primer and the reverse primers were 5′-GCAAGCTTCTAGATGGTCTGATAGCCGGCGTGACTCCTCTTCCTAGCCGTACAGATTAAAAATATTACGAGAC-3′ (LAMP I); 5′-ATCTAGAAGCTTCTAGATGGTCTGAGCGCCGGCGTGACTCCT-3′ (LAMP I-YA) and 5′-GCAAGCTTTCAGGCGTGGTCCTCCCCATCTGCGACGTGGCGGTAGCCAGGAGGCTGGGCCTGCATCCGAGCCGTACAGATTAAAAATATTACGAGAC-3′ (LAP). All the mutants and chimeric molecules were verified by dideoxy sequencing. To inhibit the synthesis of the ubiquitously expressed μ3A chain of AP-3, phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized (Genset SA, France). Since it has been found that antisense oligonucleotides are most effective when complementary to intron splice sites or initiation codons (43Marcus-Sekura C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 44Akhtar S. Juliano R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 139-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) the sequence sites selected were centered on the initiation ATG (ATG-antisense) and on a nonoverlapping site located immediately downstream (inner-antisense), deduced from the rat μ3A cDNA (24Dell'Angelica E.C.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar); ATG-antisense, 5′-TGGATCATTTTCCCG-3′; inner-antisense, 5′-ATGAGAAATAGACTG-3′. A reversed ATG-antisense (5′-GCCCTTTTACTAGGT-3′) was synthesized as the control oligonucleotide (reversed-antisense). Cells were incubated for 48 h with either antisense (5 μm ATG-antisense and 5 μm inner-antisense), reversed antisense (10 μm), or left untreated. Fresh oligonucleotides were added every 24 h. The δ-subunit of AP-3 was detected using an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a fusion protein consisting of glutathine S-transferase residues 22–756 of the δ-subunit (25Simpson F. Peden A.A. Christopoulou L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). μ3 A,B were detected using an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a GST fusion protein (29Simpson F. Bright N.A. West M.A. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). ς3 A,B were detected using a polyclonal serum prepared by immunizing rabbits with the 166–193 peptide (KNINLPEIPRNINIG) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. This polyclonal antiserum recognize a doublet by Western blotting corresponding to the ς3 A and B subunits as judged by their coelution with μ3 by gel filtration chromatography and by their presence in μ3-containing fractions of a linear 5–20% sucrose gradient (data not shown). For Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses, γ-adaptin was detected as described previously (9Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 39Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol.

The 100/3 monoclonal anti-γ-adaptin was a kind gift from Dr. Ungewickell. The human LAMP I was detected using the H4A3 mouse monoclonal antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa, IA). Rat LIMP II was detected using a monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. I. Sandoval, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain). HA was detected using a polyclonal serum or a monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Drs. Roth and Skehel). The mouse monoclonal antibody SG1 (Viro Research Inc., Rockford, IL) or a polyclonal anti-gpI were used to detect the VZV gpI. CI-MPR was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-CI-MPR antibody (45Méresse S. Ludwig T. Frank R. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18833-18842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the secondary antibodies against the Fc fragment of mouse, rat, and rabbit IgGs coupled to FITC, Texas Red, R-phycoerythrin, or horseradish peroxidase were from Dianova Immunotech GmbH (Hamburg, Germany). Cells were processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (42Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and observed using an Axiophot 2 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) and a 63×/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lens. Images were captured using a cooled charge-coupled device Micromax from Princeton Instruments Inc. (Trenton, NJ) having a Kodak RTE/CCD-1317K/1 chip (grade 1) for 12-bit image collection and that was controlled by the IPLab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics Corporation, Vienna, VA). To quantify AP-1 and AP-3 recruitment, randomly choosen fields were captured using the Micromax camera. In each field, regions containing the γ-adaptin- or δ-subunit-labeled perinuclear area from transfected or nontransfected cells were selected, and the fluorescence intensity (mean intensity/pixel) was calculated using the IPLab Spectrum software. NRK or HeLa cells were grown in 24 multiwell dish and treated or not with the oligonucleotides for 48 h. The following antibodies were then added to the culture media, the H4A3 monoclonal anti-LAMP I antibody (HeLa cells), or the anti-LIMP II monoclonal antibody (NRK cells) or an anti-CI-MPR (HeLa cells) antibody. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with these antibodies for the indicated periods of time, then washed and processed for immunofluorescence. The internalized antibodies were detected with the appropriate Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. To quantitate the extent of misrouting to the cell surface, untreated or oligonucleotide-treated HeLa or NRK cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and incubated with the H4A3 anti-LAMP I (HeLa cells) or the anti-LIMP II (NRK cells) monoclonal antibodies or anti-CI-MPR (HeLa cells) antibodies. After 1 (anti-CI-MPR) to 4 h (LAMPI and LIMPII), cells were washed and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein A-Sepharose was then added for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography. The values were normalized to the total newly synthesized LAMPI, LIMP II, or CI-MPR. Oligonucleotide-treated cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5 mm EDTA for 5 min. The detached cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with primary antibodies against CI-MPR, LAMP I, LIMP II (see above), or control IgGs followed by secondary antibodies coupled to R-phycoerythrin and analyzed using a Coulter Epics ELITE (Coultronics, Miami, FL). The in vitro recruitment of AP-3 was performed as described previously for AP-1 (46Salamero J. Le Borgne R. Saudrais C. Goud B. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30318-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) except that an anti δ-subunit antibody was used. Transport of cathepsin D was measured as described (40Mauxion F. Le Borgne R. Munier-Lehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2171-2178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylmide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (41Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The expression of physiological levels of the MPRs in MPR-negative cells triggers the recruitment of AP-1 on TGN membranes both in vivo and in vitro (9Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 39Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22552-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This property is also shared with the VZV envelope glycoprotein gpI, a TGN membrane protein which recycles between the TGN and the plasma membrane via the endosomes (42Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To investigate the sorting of the newly synthesized lysosomal membrane glycoproteins LAMP I and LIMP II along an AP-1-dependent pathway, we have tested the possibility that the expression of these proteins could also trigger AP-1 recruitment. For this, we fused the cytoplasmic domains of LIMP II, LAMP I, or LAP to the luminal and transmembrane domains of the VZV gpI, used as a reporter molecule devoid of any trafficking information (42Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). When transiently expressed in HeLa cells, these chimeric proteins were properly targeted to lysosomes as indicated by their colocalization with the endogenous LAMP I (Fig. 1). As expected from previous studies (reviewed in Sandoval and Bakke (7Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar)), a point mutation in the di-leucine-based motif of LIMP II (mutant LG) or in the tyrosine-based motif of LAMP I (mutant YA) results in the accumulation of the chimeric proteins at the cell surface (Fig. 1). Thus, the chimeric proteins and the corresponding mutants faithfully reflect the behavior of the full-length lysosomal membrane glycoproteins. Unlike the MPRs and gpI which continuously recycle back to the TGN, the newly synthesized LAMP I, LIMP II, and LAP undergo a single round of protein sorting at the exit of the TGN. Therefore, these membrane proteins are expected to contribute only to a minor extent to AP-1 recruitment. Thus, gpI-LIMP II, gpI-LAMP I, and gpI-LAP chimeric proteins were overexpressed in HeLa cells using the T7 RNA polymerase recombinant vaccinia virus as was done previously (39Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22552-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Salamero J. Le Borgne R. Saudrais C. Goud B. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30318-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As a positive control, a chimeric protein made of the luminal domain of the influenza virus hemagglutinine (HA) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the Man-6-P/IGF II receptor (HA-MPR) and the full-length gpI were also overexpressed (39Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22552-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments indicated that gpI and the different gpI chimeric proteins were synthesized to the same extent and processed to mature forms in the secretory pathway with similar kinetics (data not shown). The transfected cells were fixed and labeled with an anti-gpI or an anti-HA polyclonal antibodies to distinguish between transfected and non-transfected cells. The bulk of these different chimeric proteins was found concentrated in the perinuclear region due to the conditions of expression (see “Experimental Procedures”). The cells were also stained with a monoclonal anti-γ-adaptin antibody to label the AP-1 complex and the intensity of the AP-1 staining was then determined (see “Experimental Procedures”). The overexpression of the HA-MPR chimera (Fig. 2, g and h) or gpI (data not shown) leads to an increase of γ-adaptin staining in the perinuclear region, as described previously (39Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22552-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Typically, cells overexpressing HA-MPR or gpI exhibited a 2-fold increase in the perinuclear AP-1 staining when compared with untransfected cells (Fig. 3 A). This AP-1 staining also depends on the presence of the ARF-1 GTPase since it is sensitive to brefeldin A (data not shown). In contrast, gpI chimeric proteins did not affect γ-adaptin staining (Figs. 2 and 3 A). Collectively, these results suggest that the bulk of gpI-LIMP II, gpI-LAMP I, and gpI-LAP may be transported via an AP-1 independent pathway.Figure 3Quantitation of AP-1 and AP-3 immunostaining in HeLa cells overexpressing different gpI chimeras. The intensity of the fluorescence signals corresponding to the γ subunit of AP-1 (panel A) or the δ-subunit of AP-3 (panel B) as shown in Figs. 2, 4, and 5 was quantitated from ∼100 untransfected cells (MOCK) or ∼100 cells overexpressing HA-MPR or the full-length gpI, gpI-LAMP I wild type (LAMP I wt), mutant"
https://openalex.org/W2026443131,"The estrogen receptor (ER) is a transcription factor that binds to a specific DNA sequence found in the regulatory regions of estrogen-responsive genes, called the estrogen response element (ERE). Many genes that contain EREs have been identified, and most of these EREs contain one or more changes from the core consensus sequence, a 13-nucleotide segment with 10 nucleotides forming an inverted repeat. A number of genes have multiple copies of these imperfect EREs. In order to understand why natural EREs have developed in this manner, we have attempted to define the basic sequence requirements for ER binding. To this end, we measured the binding of homodimeric ER to a variety of nonconsensus EREs. We discovered that an ERE containing even a single change from the consensus may be unable to bind ER. However, an ERE with two changes from the consensus may be capable of binding avidly to ER in the context of certain flanking sequences. We found that changes in the sequences flanking a nonconsensus ERE can greatly alter ER-ERE affinity, either positively or negatively. Careful study of sequences flanking a series of EREs made it possible to develop rules that predict whether ER binds to a given natural ERE and also to predict the relative amounts of binding when comparing two EREs.

The estrogen receptor (ER)1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of estrogen-responsive genes by binding to a specific DNA sequence found in their regulatory regions.

Many genes have been found to contain sequences that appear to be EREs, but most of these vary from the consensus by one or more nucleotides.

Ammonium sulfate-precipitated uterine cytosol was dissolved in TDPEK 175, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 175 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and either batch absorbed to heparin-agarose resin (Affi-Gel Heparin, Bio-Rad) or dissolved in TDPEK 100, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and layered onto Yellow 86 resin (Sigma). Proteins were eluted from heparin-agarose with a linear 175–500 mm KCl gradient and from Yellow 86 with a 300 mm step gradient. The peak ER-containing fractions eluted at 300 mm KCl from heparin-agarose and at 200 mm KCl from Yellow 86. ER-containing fractions were pooled and diluted to 100 mm KCl for use in assays. ER was either liganded with 17β-[2,4,6,7,16,17-3H]estradiol (141 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) or unliganded. Typical ER concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 5 nm. All concentrations of ER refer to the amount of homodimeric ER. Final concentrations of ER were determined by hydroxylapatite assay (18Pavlik E.J. Coulson P.B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1976; 7: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recombinant human ERα from baculovirus-infected insect cells was purchased from Panvera Corp. (Madison, WI) at a concentration of 5000 or 3400 nm for use in gel shift-based determinations of ER-ERE affinity and ERE competition assays. Both strands of all oligomers were synthesized and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified by Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). The regions flanking all sequences tested were identical (Fig. 1 A). The oligomers were annealed, and 0.5 μg was 32P-end-labeled byEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment incorporation of [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]TTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). 32P-End-labeled DNA (60,000 cpm) and 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 μl of ER were incubated with poly(dI-dC) (0.45 μg, Midland Certified Reagents, Midland, TX) and an ER-supershifting antibody (either c-311 from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA or H222, a gift from Abbott) in a total reaction volume of 60 μl. Reactions were incubated at 0 °C for 60 min and loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 1.5 h at room temperature in 1× TBE (100 mm Tris base, 0.831 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried at 80 °C under vacuum and exposed to film overnight. 6 μl of 3400 nmrecombinant human ER was diluted with 1040 μl of TDPEK 100, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 containing 8.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). 15 μl of the ER-poly(dI-dC) mixture was added to tubes containing 6 μg of 32P-labeled p17 ERE that had been premixed with increasing concentrations of the appropriate competitor. Total reaction volume was 18 μl. The mixture was incubated on ice for 1.5 h. 10 μl was loaded onto a 5% native polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis at 150 V for 1.5 h. The gels were dried at 80 °C under vacuum and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) overnight. DNA counts in the appropriate bands were quantitated and graphed. Oligomers were dissolved at concentrations above 1000 ng/μl, as determined by fluorimetry (Hoefer DynaQuant 200, Hoefer Instruments), and32P-end-labeled using E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (3′-5′ exo-) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) incorporation of [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Labeling was stopped by heating the mixture to 70 °C for 10 min, as per the manufacturer's instructions. The specific activity of labeled DNA was determined as follows. One-fortieth volume of the crude labeling mixture was spotted onto a TLC plate (polyethyleneimine-cellulose, EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ), and the plate was developed in an aqueous solution of 0.37 mHCl with 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate. The unincorporated counts migrated with the solvent front, whereas the labeled DNA remained at the origin. The plate was divided into thirds, and each third was counted separately in scintillation vials containing EcoScint A (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). The incorporated radioactivity at the origin and the quantity of DNA in the reaction were used to calculate the specific activity of each ERE. Increasing concentrations of each [32P]DNA sample (1-μl volume) were mixed with a constant amount (30 μl) of diluted ER (6 μl of 5000 nmPanvera ERα, 1294 μl of TDPEK 100, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 containing 3.0 μg of poly(dI-dC)). Reactions were incubated for 1.5 h at 0 °C, loaded onto a 5% native gel, and separated by electrophoresis at 150 V for 1.5 h. The gels were dried at 80 °C under vacuum and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen overnight. DNA counts in the appropriate bands were quantitated and graphed. A semilog plot of the saturation curves was used to determine the ERE concentration at the midpoint of the maximal amount of ER·ERE complex. Actual K d values were calculated using the equation,Kd=[EREmidpoint]−½[ER](Eq. 1) where [EREmidpoint] is the concentration of labeled ERE that results in a gel shift of half-maximal intensity (15Driscoll M.D. Klinge C.M. Hilf R. Bambara R.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,19Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K.

A. 1986; 83: 8462-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The concentration of ER had to be determined independently, because a significant proportion of the recombinant Panvera ER was incapable of binding ERE. The concentration of active ER was measured by titrating known ERE concentrations against a constant but unknown concentration of ER and subjecting the reactions to gel shift. In the shifted complex, the amount of ERE bound equaled the amount of ER bound. Since both the bound and free ERE were quantitated using the PhosphorImager, and the total amount of ERE was known, the molar quantity of bound and free ERE could be determined. At a saturating concentration of ERE, the maximal amount of ERE bound equaled the concentration of ER. This value was used to calculateK d. We designed a series of ERE oligomers varying in sequence in our effort to define the requirements for stable binding to ER. Single-stranded oligomers containing variants of the ERE core consensus sequence were synthesized, gel-purified, and annealed, to create double-stranded DNA. Each substrate consisted of a test segment, having a sequence resembling the core consensus ERE, embedded in a larger oligomer. We call the additional length of oligomer the “background sequence.” The background nucleotides were arranged to avoid any sequences related to the core consensus ERE. Therefore, the background is not able to stabilize ER-ERE interaction, except by providing a natural DNA extension on either side of the ERE. The background sequence is shown in Fig. 1 A, and the test sequences are shown in Fig. 1 B. The rationale for choice of the test sequences will be explained below. Binding was measured by gel shift, under conditions previously found to allow efficient ER-ERE binding (15Driscoll M.D. Klinge C.M. Hilf R. Bambara R.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We performed binding assays using partially purified ER obtained from calf uteri, at concentrations of ER under 10 nm. We did this for two reasons: first, to have our in vitro assays approximate the levels of ER found inside the cell (21Gorski J. Furlow J.D. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M. Kaneko K. Ying C. Malayer J.R. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and, second, to have the ER produced in, modified in, and obtained from a mammalian source in a mixture of proteins that naturally occur with ER. The binding assays then served to test whether the results obtained using the highly purified recombinant baculovirus-expressed ER apply to ER-purified directly from calf. Antibody was used to supershift the ER-containing complexes in the binding assays, which resulted in a clear separation of the ER-containing shifts from those that were the result of non-ER proteins. Because of concerns that antibodies could affect the amounts of shifted complex, two different antibodies were used, in separate experiments. Both antibodies, H222 and c311 (see “Experimental Procedures”), gave identical results. One set of results is shown. The results of the experiments containing antibody were identical to those performed without antibody, except that the supershift allowed clear visualization of low levels of ER-ERE binding. For ERE competition experiments and for determinations of ER-ERE affinity, pure recombinant baculovirus-expressed human ER from Panvera was used because it was critical to have pure ER at high concentration. The correlation of results between ER-ERE binding assays, ER-ERE affinities, and ERE competition assays was absolute, showing that gel shift is a very robust and sensitive method for comparing ER binding to consensus and nonconsensus EREs. In addition, the results of experiments using human ER mirrored those seen with calf ER. Both estradiol-liganded and -unliganded ER behaved in an identical manner in gel shift assays using the consensus ERE (Ref. 15Driscoll M.D. Klinge C.M. Hilf R. Bambara R.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and data not shown). All assays shown were performed with unliganded ER. Nucleotides within the test sequences are defined by the numbering system shown in Fig. 1 D. Fig. 2, lanes 1–11, contains gel shift results comparing the binding of ER to two EREs that differ by a one-base pair substitution. Oligomer p13, shown in lanes 1–6, contains the consensus 5′-GGTCAnnnTGACC-3′ inverted repeat. ER-ERE binding produced a prominent supershifted band. The sequence 13d1 in lanes 7–11 (Fig. 2) contained a T to G base substitution in the −4-position (Fig. 1 D). No supershifted band was evident, indicating that ER was not able to bind to this oligomer. Therefore, we concluded that ER-ERE binding can be disrupted by a single base change from the consensus. We extended these findings by testing ER binding to other EREs with single base substitutions at each position in one arm of the inverted repeat (Fig. 1 B). In no case was any supershifted ER·ERE complex visible (data not shown). Because ER binds ERE sequences as a homodimer (8Notides A.C. Lerner N. Hamilton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30205-30212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and each ER molecule contacts a different arm of the ERE inverted repeat (27Schwabe J.W. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), any change made to an arm of the ERE should increase or decrease ER-ERE affinity in a manner identical to a change in the same position of the other arm of the inverted repeat. This was tested by comparing 13d1, which contains a T to G change at the −4-position of the ERE, to 13G1, where the +4-position of the 13-bp ERE was changed from an A to a G. Both changes resulted in a loss of ER-ERE binding. Also, the −4-position in 13d1 was changed from a pyrimidine to a purine, whereas the +4-position was changed from a purine to another purine. It was possible that ER-ERE affinity could be dependent on the general structure of the nucleotide, but this did not appear to be the case. We concluded that any change made in the left arm of the inverted repeat can be considered to have an effect identical to the mirror change made in the right arm of the inverted repeat. Although all possible base substitutions were not tested, these results are fully consistent with the hypothesis that all changes in the core consensus are equivalent in their disruption of binding. We considered whether sequences flanking the core 13-bp ERE could alter ER-ERE binding. The first experiment (Fig. 2, lanes 7–11) involved the labeled 13d1 oligomer (Fig. 1 B), which has a single base change from the consensus 13-bp ERE. No supershifted ER was visible, indicating that ER was unable to bind this element. Lanes 12–16(Fig. 2) contained the 15d1 ERE, which has the same change from the consensus as 13d1. However, the nucleotides on either side of the 13-bp ERE have been substituted with nucleotides identical to those that immediately flank the core inverted repeat of the potent vitellogenin A2 ERE. ER binding to this new ERE produced an intense supershifted band. Lanes 17–21 show the binding of ER to 17d1, a 17-bp inverted repeat containing a single change from the consensus, with two nucleotides on either side of the core ERE converted to those of the vitellogenin A2 ERE. The appearance of a dark supershifted band confirmed that ER was also able to bind well to this ERE sequence. Although a single change from the consensus was enough to abolish ER binding in the presence of 13d1 background sequences, the sequences adjacent to the core in 15d1 and 17d1 rescued ER-ERE binding. Fig. 3shows gel shift assays that contain substrates designed to explore the contributions of 5′ A residues immediately adjacent to the core 13-base pair ERE. As was seen previously, there was no binding of ER to 13d1 (Fig. 3, lanes 1–6). The addition of a single A residue adjacent to the 13d1 sequence (substrate 13d1 + A, Fig. 3,lanes 7–12) resulted in the recovery of ER binding. Lanes 13–18 show ER binding to 15d1, which has a 5′ A residue present on both strands of the oligomer. The sensitive nature of this assay allowed the determination that there was clearly more ER binding to 15d1 than to 13d1 + A. This result demonstrates that ER-ERE binding is influenced by the sequence at both of these sites. ER binding to an ERE with a single base change depends on the sequence immediately flanking the 13-base pair inverted repeat. The base oligomer around the 13d1 ERE included T and C at the −7-position of the upper and lower strand, respectively, but ER was unable to bind. This indicated that pyrimidines at this position inhibited ER-ERE binding. The addition of an A at the −7-position of either strand, however, supported ER binding (Fig. 3). In order to test whether the sequence preference for optimal ER-ERE binding included only A at the −7 position, ER-ERE binding to 13d1 + G was tested (Fig. 4). In fact, the addition of a G residue at the −7-position reconstituted approximately the same level of ER binding as an A residue. For both 13d1 + A and 13d1 + G, the level of ER bound was significant but was below the level seen for ER binding to 15d1 (Figs. 3 and 4). This result suggests that a 15-bp extended ERE consensus sequence includes either G or A at the −7-position of each strand. We also needed to know whether sequences beyond those immediately flanking the core ERE affect ER binding affinity. The 17d1 oligomer was used to test whether increasing the inverted repeat beyond the A at −7 in 15d1 contributes to ER affinity. However, ER binding to 17d1 and 15d1 was not noticeably different. The high affinity binding of ER to either sequence resulted in a very stable ER·ERE complex. This made it difficult to determine whether additional vitellogenin A2 flanking sequences present in 17d1 resulted in more ER-ERE binding than was seen for 15d1 (data not shown). To overcome this difficulty, ER binding to 17d1AT was compared with ER binding to 15d1AT. Reduced overall ER binding allowed a better assessment of possible low level binding enhancement to 17d1ATversus 15d1AT. Gel shift assays were performed using oligomer 15d1AT, in which the 5′ A residue in position −7 on both strands, immediately flanking the imperfect core ERE, was exchanged for a T. This substitution conserved the length of the inverted repeat and the presence of an A-T base pair flanking the imperfect sequence on both sides but put the A-T base pair in an opposite orientation with respect to 15d1 (Fig. 1). This resulted in complete loss of ER binding, identical to the result seen for 13d1. Because ER was unable to bind 15d1AT, any ER binding to 17d1AT can be attributed to the extended flanking sequences. Subsequently, gel shifts were performed in parallel using 17d1AT, the same sequence as 15d1AT, except for the addition of a 5′ C residue at position −8 on both strands (Fig. 1), similar to the sequence of the vitellogenin A2 ERE. The presence of the C in the −8 position of both strands resulted in a supershifted ER·ERE complex (data not shown). A single C on one strand of the ERE at −8 was not sufficient to reconstitute ER binding in 15d1AT. Recovery of ER-ERE binding required the correct sequence at position −8 on both strands of the 13d1 ERE. This shows that the identity of bases two residues distant from the core consensus is important for ER-ERE binding to nonconsensus EREs. The gel shift in Fig. 5 demonstrates the decrease in binding of ER as the ERE sequence varies from the consensus. In lanes 1–6, where the ERE has only a single change from the consensus, a strong ER supershift was seen. In lanes 7–12, where the ERE has two changes from the consensus, there was a relative decrease in ER-ERE binding. In lanes 13–18, where the sequence incorporates three changes from the consensus, there was no ER binding. Similar results were seen for 17d1, 17d2, and 17d3 (data not shown). These experiments reveal that, with the appropriate flanking sequences, up to two changes from the core 13-bp consensus can support ER-ERE binding. However, there was no case where we observed ER-ERE binding when the ERE contained more than two changes from the core consensus. Can one flanking nucleotide compensate for two changes in the core sequence? The experiment in Fig. 6 was designed to test the binding of ER to a sequence that contained the same two changes from the consensus as the construct 15d2 but had only one compensatory A residue, at the −7-position of one strand. As seen in Fig. 5, lanes 7–12, 15d2 was able to bind ER, showing that the presence of A residues at −7 on both strands was sufficient to compensate for two changes to the sequence core. In Fig. 6, however, there was clearly no ER binding to 13d2 + A, showing that a single flanking sequence cannot compensate for two changes to the core. This result is consistent with the pattern in which each single change in the 13-bp inverted repeat requires a compensatory change in the immediate flanking sequence. Fig. 7 Ademonstrates how different unlabeled EREs compete with labeled p17 for binding to ER. This experiment was repeated at least three times for each oligomer, with similar results. The EREs with the highest affinity for ER, p15 and p17, effectively competed away the shifted complex. At a 40-fold excess of unlabeled over labeled ERE, less than 5% of the initial complex remained. The essentially indistinguishable curves show that the affinities of both of these EREs for ER are similar. The 15d1 ERE, which has the 15-bp inverted repeat with a single change from the consensus, did not compete as efficiently as the intact 15- and 17-bp inverted repeats. Interestingly, however, 15d1 competed more efficiently than the perfect 13-bp inverted repeat, showing that this imperfect ERE has higher affinity for ER than the perfect p13 sequence. The 15d2, with two changes from the p15 consensus, and the 17d1AT, which has only the outermost vitellogenin A2 flanking sequences intact at ±8-positions, have much lower, but similar affinities for ER. 15d2 and 17d1AT were the constructs that had the lowest levels of detectable binding in the gel shift assays performed at physiological levels of ER, as above. Neither 15d3, which had three changes from the p15 consensus, nor 13d1, which had a single change from the p13 consensus, bound detectable levels of ER in the binding assays. The competition experiments revealed that they both have extremely low affinity for ER. After a 160-fold excess of 15d3 was added, 90% of the binding activity remained. We were unable to detect any competition by 13d1 for ER binding, even at a 320-fold excess of ERE. It was surprising that the effect of this single change was so profound. Gel shift assays were used to calculate the binding affinity of p13, p15, and 15d2 for ER. Increasing concentrations of ERE were added to a constant amount of ER. The bound and free ERE bands were quantitated using the PhosphorImager. Semilogarithmic plots of ERE titrations resulted in three distinctly different S-shaped saturation curves. The experiment was repeated three times for each construct, and the average value ± S.E. was graphed (Fig. 7 B). Affinities were determined as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The affinity of ER for the p17 inverted repeat (0.25 nm) has been previously determined by other methods (15Driscoll M.D. Klinge C.M. Hilf R. Bambara R.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because both the binding and competition assays showed little difference between p17 and p15 affinities for ER, we expected the calculated affinity of p15 to be close to 0.25 nm. In fact, the calculated affinity was 0.54 nm, very close to the expected value. Because 15d2 bound ER with low affinity, it was not possible to achieve saturation, even at maximal concentrations of 15d2. However, at saturation the amount of bound DNA equals the amount of active ER. Because the amount of ER used in each experiment was identical, the maximum possible amount of bound 15d2 equals the amount of active ER. Since we could use this anticipated saturation value, the points on the curve at high concentrations of 15d2 were not necessary for an accurate determination of K d. TheK d for 15d2 was calculated to be 20.0 nm. Given the previous results seen for the ER-ERE binding and competition experiments, we expected the binding curve for p13 to position between that of p15 and 15d2. The plot of the binding data showed that this was in fact the case, and the K dfor p13 was determined to be 6.9 nm. We have identified sequence requirements for ER to recognize EREs. It had been reported that the 13-bp inverted repeat 5′-GGTCAnnnTGACC-3′ ERE is the minimum length sequence having two essential qualities, the ability to bind in a stable complex with ER and to mediate the induction of estrogen-responsive genes (3Klein-Hitpass L.

Here we report the identification of a novel gene product, Partner of Numb (PON), based on its physical interaction with Numb. PON is asymmetrically localized during mitosis and colocalizes with Numb. Loss of pon function disrupts Numb localization in muscle progenitors and delays Numb crescent formation in neural precursors. Moreover, ectopically expressed PON responds to the apical-basal polarity of epithelial cells and is sufficient to localize Numb basally. We propose that PON is one component of a multimolecular machinery that localizes Numb by responding to polarity cues conserved in neural precursors and epithelial cells."

Although this neuropathological process can be mediated by any of the excitatory amino acid receptors, the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)1 glutamate receptor subtype plays a major role. In addition, NMDA receptors mediate adaptive responses important for synaptic plasticity during development (4Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E.

TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC are, respectively, the receptors for NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 (20Rodriguez-Tebar A. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1990; 4: 487-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 21Lamballe F. Klein R. Barbacid M. Cell. 1990; 66: 679-967Google Scholar, 22Klein R. Jing S. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Binding of neurotrophin to its receptor triggers a signal transduction pathway, with Trk phosphorylation being the primary event and induction of several genes as a late event (for review, see Ref. 23Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). These events may play a role in the trophic properties of neurotrophins, including the ability to attenuate excitotoxic cell death (24Frim D.M. Uhler T.A. Short P.M. Ezzedine D.Z. Klagsbrun M. Breakefield X.O. Isacson O. NeuroReport. 1993; 4: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of a specific Trk receptor may confer resistance against excitotoxicity depending on availability of the primary ligand. Among neurotrophins, BDNF has been shown to function in an autocrine fashion in the peripheral nervous system (25Acheson A. Conover J.C. Fandl J.P. DeChiara T.M. Russel M. Thadani A. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. Nature. 1995; 374: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), suggesting that in cerebellar granule cells, which express BDNF (26Favaron M. Manev R.M. Rimland J.M. Candeo P. Beccaro M. Manev H. NeuroReport. 1993; 4: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Bessho Y. Nakanishi S. Nawa H. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), this neurotrophin could exert neuroprotective properties by activating its own receptor in a similar autocrine loop. This mechanism could be unique for central nervous system neurons and might represent one of the molecular events in NMDA-mediated neuroprotection. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that NMDA mediates neuronal survival by affecting the release of BDNF and therefore the functional state of the TrkB receptor. We report that NMDA exerts a neuroprotective activity by increasing BDNF release and TrkB receptor signaling. Granule cells were prepared from postnatal day 8 Sprague Dawley rat pups. Briefly, meninges-free cerebella were minced and recovered by centrifugation. The pellets from 20 cerebella were subjected to trypsinization, followed by inactivation of the trypsin by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were then dissociated by a series of triturations and recovered by centrifugation. The final pellet was reconstituted in basal Eagle's medium containing glutamine (2 mm), fetal calf serum (10%), and potassium chloride (25 mm). No antibiotics were added, and the plating density was 1.8 × 106 cells/ml. Cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added 18–24 h later to inhibit the proliferation of non-neuronal constituents (9Marini A.M. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6555-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). On day 7 in vitro, glucose (100 μl of a 100 mm solution) and sterile water (100 μl) were added to each 35-mm culture dish to maintain survival and to replace evaporative losses, respectively. Granule cell neurons were used on day 8 in vitro for all experiments unless otherwise indicated. NIH3T3 cells overexpressing TrkB (a gift from Cephalon Inc.) were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum in the presence of geneticin (150 μg/ml). Cultured cerebellar granule cells were pretreated with NMDA (100 μm) with or without K252a (10 nm) or trkB-IgG (20 μg/ml) for 6 h. Medium was then removed and replaced with sister culture medium. Either inhibitor and glutamate (100 μm) was added, and neuronal viability was determined 24 h later using the fluorescein diacetate method as described previously (9Marini A.M. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6555-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The viable neurons were quantified by counting fluorescein-positive cell bodies and expressed as percent of survival. Analysis of Trk tyrosine phosphorylation was carried out essentially as described (28Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebellar granule cells were exposed for 10 min to human recombinant BDNF (Promega, Madison, WI), NGF (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA), or NT-3 (Genentech, San Francisco, CA) (100 ng/ml each) and disrupted in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm sodium vanadate) at 4 °C. After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation, protein levels in the lysates were measured by the Bradford Coomassie Blue colorimetric assay and equalized accordingly. Lysates were incubated with pan-trk antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by protein A-Sepharose precipitation (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitate was washed with lysis buffer and water before resuspension in 10 μl of sample buffer (2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) followed by fractionation through 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the immobilized proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) diluted with Tris-buffered saline with a final concentration of 0.2% Tween 20. Blots were analyzed by using enhanced chemiluminescence detection according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The quantitative two-site enzyme immunoassay for the determination of BDNF was performed using an immunoassay system from Promega (BDNF Emax immunoassay system). In brief, neurons (1.8 × 106 cells/ml) were exposed to NMDA (100 μm) for various times, and the medium was then collected and concentrated using a Centricon-10 (Amicon) concentrator as described previously (29Rabin S.J. Tornatore C. Baker-Cairns B. Spiga G. Mocchetti I. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In a series of parallel experiments, neurons were lysed for the determination of intracellular BDNF levels. Extraction of RNA and RNase protection assay were carried out as described (30Mocchetti I. Spiga G. Hayes V.Y. Isackson P.J. Colangelo A.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2141-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of BDNF mRNA were determined using a 32P-labeled BDNF cRNA probe generated from plasmid R1112-8 (a gift from Dr. P. J. Isackson, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL) comprising 387 nucleotides from the 5′ coding region of rat BDNF cDNA plus 59 nucleotides from the Bluescript polylinker region (31Isackson P.J. Hunstman M.M. Murray K.D. Gall C.M. Neuron. 1991; 6: 937-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). This cRNA (specific activity, >1 × 108 cpm/μg of RNA) was used to hybridize 20–25 μg of total RNA in 20 μl of hybridization solution. Hybridization was carried out at 50 °C overnight. RNA was digested with RNase A (1 unit/ml) and T1 (200 units/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were recovered using isopropanol (1:1 v/v). The pellet containing the RNA:RNA hybrid was dissolved in loading buffer (80% formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 2 mmEDTA) and boiled at 95 °C, and RNA was separated on a 5% polyacrylamide/urea sequencing gel. The gel was dried, and protected mRNA fragments were visualized by autoradiography using x-ray film with a Chronex Quanta III intensifying screen. The content of BDNF mRNA was calculated by measuring the peak densitometry area of the autoradiograph analyzed with a laser densitometer (Hoefer GS 300 scanning densitometer) normalized by the peak densitometry area of the cyclophilin autoradiograph band as described previously (30Mocchetti I. Spiga G. Hayes V.Y. Isackson P.J. Colangelo A.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2141-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined whether cerebellar granule cells, on day 8 in vitro, express an active form of TrkB or other Trk receptors by determining Trk tyrosine phosphorylation in lysates from these cells. BDNF (100 ng/ml) but not NGF (100 ng/ml) elicited a strong increase in Trk phosphorylation (Fig. 1, upper panel) without affecting Trk levels (Fig. 1, lower panel). NT-3 (100 ng/ml) induced a weak increase in Trk phosphorylation (Fig. 1, upper panel) that was seen only after prolonged exposure. The low potency of NT-3 in inducing Trk phosphorylation indicated the presence of a small amount of TrkC receptors in these neurons or cross-binding of NT-3 with TrkB receptors. Because activation of the Trk tyrosine kinase by neurotrophins represents an immediate and essential event in the neurotrophin signal cascade (18Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F. Science. 1991; 252: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), TrkB appears to be the only functional neurotrophin receptor expressed by cerebellar granule cells at this day in culture. In addition to TrkB, cerebellar granule cells produce BDNF mRNA, whose levels can be altered by NMDA receptor activation (26Favaron M. Manev R.M. Rimland J.M. Candeo P. Beccaro M. Manev H. NeuroReport. 1993; 4: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Bessho Y. Nakanishi S. Nawa H. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that NMDA-mediated neuroprotection may involve de novo synthesis of BDNF, which, in turn, activates its cognate receptor. To test whether NMDA may activate this “survival” loop, we first examined the neuroprotective properties of BDNF compared with those of NGF and NT-3. Addition of BDNF (100 ng/ml) to the culture medium for 24 h protected the neurons against a concentration of glutamate (100 μm), which in these cells is known to induce cell death (Table I). Moreover, the survival effect of BDNF was similar to that produced by a subtoxic concentration of NMDA (Table I). NGF and NT-3 (100 ng/ml) were ineffective in preventing glutamate-mediated cell death (Table I), consistent with the lack of expression of functional TrkA or TrkC receptors in these cells.Table IEffect of neurotrophins in protecting cultured cerebellar granule cells against glutamate receptor-mediated cell deathTreatmentCell survival%No treatment95 ± 4Glutamate (100 μm)46 ± 6NMDA (100 μm) + glutamate (100 μm)82 ± 81-ap < 0.01 by analysis of variance and Student's t test.BDNF (100 ng/ml) + glutamate (100 μm)81 ± 51-ap < 0.01 by analysis of variance and Student's t test.NT-3 (100 ng/ml) + glutamate (100 μm)44 ± 11NGF (100 ng/ml) + glutamate (100 μm)49 ± 9Granule cells were prepared as previously described (9Marini A.M. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6555-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Each neurotrophin was added to the culture medium 1 h before the addition of glutamate (100 μm), whereas NMDA was added for 3 h, followed by removal and replacement of the culture medium with sister culture medium before the addition of glutamate. Neuronal survival was measured 24 h later using the fluorescein diacetate method (9Marini A.M. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6555-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).1-a p < 0.01 by analysis of variance and Student's t test.

Each neurotrophin was added to the culture medium 1 h before the addition of glutamate (100 μm), whereas NMDA was added for 3 h, followed by removal and replacement of the culture medium with sister culture medium before the addition of glutamate. Neuronal survival was measured 24 h later using the fluorescein diacetate method (9Marini A.M. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6555-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine whether the NMDA survival-promoting activity correlated with increased availability of BDNF, we examined the temporal kinetics of BDNF synthesis and release after NMDA treatment. BDNF de novosynthesis was estimated by measuring the steady-state content of BDNF mRNA and protein at various times after NMDA treatment. NMDA elicited a time-dependent increase in BDNF mRNA content, beginning at 3 h (2-fold) and lasting at least up to 8 h (Fig. 2). The increase was blocked by MK-801 (Fig. 2). To determine whether NMDA increases BDNF synthesis, Western blot analysis was carried out on lysate of cells exposed to NMDA for 10 min or 3 h. Analysis of BDNF immunoreactivity revealed that NMDA increases intracellular BDNF levels by 3 h but not by 10 min (data not shown), suggesting that NMDA affects synthesis of BDNF at a later time. To examine whether NMDA increases the release of BDNF, medium from cells was collected at 10 min after NMDA pretreatment. Analysis of 100-μl medium aliquots from a total of 4 ml revealed that the levels of BDNF were below the limit of detection of this assay. Therefore, the medium (4 ml) from a single plate was concentrated to 100-μl fractions using Centricon as described previously (31Isackson P.J. Hunstman M.M. Murray K.D. Gall C.M. Neuron. 1991; 6: 937-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), and then a 25-μl fraction was used for Western blot analysis. A single BDNF-immunoreactive band, migrating with a molecular weight similar to that of the recombinant BDNF, was observed in the medium from control and NMDA-treated cells (Fig. 3). Thus, these neurons appear to release authentic BDNF. Because Western blot analysis does not provide an absolute quantitative measurement of BDNF levels, medium was then collected at 2 and 5 min or 3 h after the exposure of neurons to NMDA or medium alone and analyzed by a BDNF two-site immunoassay. The BDNF level in the medium of control cells was 39.5 ± 2.8 pg/ml, well above the limit of detection of this assay (16 pg/ml). Analysis of BDNF in the medium from NMDA-treated cells revealed an increase in BDNF levels by 2 min (Table II). BDNF levels were further increased by NMDA at 5 min (Table II). An increase in accumulation of BDNF was still observed by 3 h in medium from NMDA-treated cells, suggesting that NMDA elicits a time-dependent increase in BDNF release.Table IINMDA increases BDNF levels in cerebellar granule cell mediumTreatmentBDNFpg/mlControl 2 min39.0 ± 2.8NMDA 2 min64.2 ± 152-ap < 0.05 versus control (Student's t test).Control 5 min43.5 ± 5.7NMDA 5 min94.0 ± 21.12-ap < 0.05 versus control (Student's t test).Control 3 h84.0 ± 9.3NMDA 3 h151.3 ± 312-ap < 0.05 versus control (Student's t test).Granule cells were prepared as previously described (9Marini A.M.

Cells were exposed for 2 or 5 min or 3 h to medium either alone or containing NMDA (100 μm). Medium (4 ml) was collected, concentrated (Centricon) to 200 μl, and assayed in duplicate by two-site immunoassay. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least two independent experiments (n = 4). To determine whether the NMDA survival-promoting activity correlates with a BDNF autocrine signal, we examined TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation after NMDA treatment. A subtoxic concentration of NMDA (100 μm) increased TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation above basal levels within 10 min (Fig. 4, upper panel). This increase was weaker than that evoked by maximal concentrations of BDNF (100 ng/ml), but it lasted up to 6 h (Fig. 4, upper panel) and was blocked by the selective NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (1 μm) (data not shown). As a control for potential artifacts attributable to a nonspecific activation of TrkB by NMDA, TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation was determined in NIH3T3 cells overexpressing TrkB receptors but not responsive to NMDA. Although BDNF increased TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation, exposure of these cells to NMDA (100 μm) failed to elicit this response (data not shown), indicating that the presence of NMDA receptors was required for TrkB activation. The temporal similarity between TrkB activation and increased BDNF levels in the medium suggested that the rapid (within minutes) effect of NMDA on TrkB phosphorylation was most likely attributable to the activity-dependent release of BDNF. The release hypothesis was tested by using a trkB “receptor body,” a chimeric protein generated by the fusion of the extracellular portion of TrkB with the Fc domain of human IgG heavy chain (trkB-IgG), which has been shown to block different BDNF biological activities (32Shelton D.L. Sutherland J. Gripp J. Camerato T. Armanini M.P. Philips H.S. Carrol K. Spencer S.D. Levinson A.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 477-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cabelli R.J. Shelton D.L. Segal R.A. Shatz C.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 63-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Pretreatment for 10 min of cerebellar granule cells with trkB-IgG (20 μg/ml) inhibited the BDNF-mediated increase in TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation and abolished the ability of NMDA to enhance TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5). These data confirm that NMDA increases TrkB phosphorylation most likely by enhancing BDNF release. The ability of trkB-IgG to efficiently block TrkB signaling allowed us to further test our hypothesis that BDNF and TrkB are involved in the neuroprotective effect mediated by NMDA. Preincubation of cerebellar granule cells with trkB-IgG (20 μg/ml) blocked the protective properties of NMDA (Fig. 6). In fact, counting surviving neurons revealed that the ability of NMDA to reduce cell death from toxic concentrations of glutamate is dramatically reduced (Fig. 6), confirming that the survival-promoting effect of NMDA is mediated by its ability to enhance TrkB signaling. To examine the specificity of trkB-IgG, cells were also preincubated with the Fc portion of IgG (10 μg/ml) before NMDA. In these cells, NMDA exerted a neuroprotective activity against an excitotoxic concentration of glutamate (Fig. 6), indicating that the effect of trkB-IgG is not attributable to its immunoglobulin property. Moreover, trkB-IgG did not adversely affect neuronal survival in the presence or absence of NMDA and did not increase the excitotoxicity of glutamate, indicating that trkB-IgG is not an agonist, antagonist, or modifier of the NMDA receptor (Fig. 6). Furthermore, preincubation of cultured neurons with the tyrosine phosphorylation antagonist K252a (10 nm) inhibited the NMDA receptor-mediated neuroprotection (Fig. 6), further suggesting that neuronal survival evoked by NMDA requires activation of the TrkB receptor. Interestingly, both TrkB-IgG and K252a did not alter neuronal survival (Fig. 6), suggesting that TrkB activation is not required for basal survival of cerebellar granule cells. Stimulation of the NMDA glutamate receptor subtype can result in neuronal protection from glutamate toxicity (9Marini A.M. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6555-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The cellular and molecular mechanisms of such neuroprotection are unclear. In the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that NMDA exerts trophic activity by activating neurotrophin signaling. We first established that BDNF but not NGF or NT-3 is the only neurotrophin that protects cerebellar granule cells against glutamate toxicity. Consistent with our data, previous findings have shown that BDNF protects cerebellar granule cells against glutamate-mediated cell death (10Lindholm D. Dechant G. Heisenberg C.P. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This is probably attributable to the fact that TrkB is the only functional neurotrophin receptor expressed in cerebellar granule cells at day 8in vitro, as also demonstrated by the ability of BDNF to induce phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ (34Zirriebel O.U. Ohga Y. Carter B. Berninger B. Inagaki N. Thoenen H. Lindholm D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2241-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), a protein that interacts with activated Trk and is involved in neurotrophin signaling (35Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 24: 1404-1417Crossref Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Most importantly, we have shown that NMDA elicits a time-dependent, measurable increase in BDNF in the medium and TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that one of the mechanisms underlying the ability of NMDA to activate TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation might be the increased release of BDNF, which, in turn, may activate the tyrosine phosphorylation of its own receptor in an autocrine manner. This autocrine loop, although described for developing sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (25Acheson A. Conover J.C. Fandl J.P. DeChiara T.M. Russel M. Thadani A. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. Nature. 1995; 374: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), is novel for central nervous system neurons. Because TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation is an essential event in the BDNF signal cascade, our data suggest that the activity-dependent survival effect of NMDA may rely on its ability to activate Trk signaling via the release of BDNF. We used different tools to test this hypothesis. First, we determined whether NMDA activates release and synthesis of BDNF. We have obtained data to support the idea that NMDA induces the release of BDNF. We showed an early (by 2 min) accumulation of BDNF in the medium of neurons incubated with NMDA. This accumulation was greater by 5 min and was not attributable to an increase in intracellular BDNF levels or BDNF mRNA. An increased in BDNF levels in the medium was also observed after 3 h incubation with NMDA. By this time, the NMDA-mediated increase in BDNF in the medium was accompanied by a concomitant accumulation of BDNF mRNA, suggesting that at 3 h NMDA, in addition to the release, also affects BDNF synthesis. Therefore, we propose that NMDA elicits two temporally distinct responses: an early release of BDNF and a later increased BDNF synthesis and release. Further support for the hypothesis that NMDA may regulate the release of BDNF was obtained by examining the functional state of the TrkB receptor. It has been established that BDNF binding to TrkB evokes a highly specific, rapid, and easily measurable receptor autophosphorylation. Thus, TrkB phosphorylation can be a useful response to estimate the biological effectiveness of BDNF. Our data show that in cerebellar granule cells NMDA elicits a rapid increase in TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation (within 10 min). NMDA failed to increase TrkB phosphorylation in trkB-transfected NIH3T3 cells, which do not express NMDA receptors. Furthermore, the NMDA-mediated increase in TrkB phosphorylation was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Thus, TrkB activation by NMDA is a receptor-mediated event that occurs in cells responsive to glutamatergic input rather than a nonspecific effect of NMDA. Our data are also consistent with recent findings showing that glutamate enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-associated protein 2 kinase (36Bading H. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 253: 912-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), one of the downstream target proteins activated by neurotrophins (35Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 24: 1404-1417Crossref Scopus (473) Google Scholar) in neurons. By increasing BDNF release and activating TrkB receptors, NMDA may therefore indirectly exert trophic activity. Consistent with the hypothesis that NMDA activates a BDNF autocrine loop, NMDA failed to increase TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation when neurons were exposed concomitantly to the trkB-IgG receptor body. TrkB-IgG has a binding affinity and specificity similar to TrkB and by being a soluble protein can sequester BDNF. Accordingly, it has been used as a new tool to block different biological activities of endogenously produced BDNF (32Shelton D.L. Sutherland J. Gripp J. Camerato T. Armanini M.P. Philips H.S. Carrol K. Spencer S.D. Levinson A.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 477-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cabelli R.J. Shelton D.L. Segal R.A. Shatz C.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 63-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We showed that the ability of NMDA to prevent glutamate cell death was blocked when cerebellar granule cells were exposed to the trkB-IgG fusion protein. In contrast, the ability of NMDA to prevent glutamate toxicity was not blocked when cells were preincubated with IgG, indicating that the TrkB portion of the molecule inhibits the activity of NMDA, thus eliminating a possible immunoglobulin effect of trkB-IgG. Moreover, the important role of BDNF and TrkB signaling in NMDA-mediated neuroprotection is further supported by data showing that NMDA fails to prevent glutamate-mediated cell death when neurons were preincubated with K252a, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in several studies as a tool to inhibit neurotrophin activity. Together these data provide support for the hypothesis that the neuroprotective properties of NMDA may involve a BDNF autocrine loop. The increase in TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation by NMDA is weaker than that elicited by BDNF. This apparent lack of correlation between the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation and neuronal protection is not surprising. In cultured cerebellar granule cells, a natural ganglioside, GM1 (6Favaron M. Manev H. Alho H. Bertolino M. Ferret B. Guidotti A. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), as well as other synthetic gangliosides, block glutamate-mediated cell death without affecting the function of NMDA or other glutamate-operated cation channels (37Manev H. Favaron M. Vicini S. Guidotti A. Costa E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 419-427PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, GM1, which does not affect synthesis of neurotrophins, has been shown to mimic neurotrophin activity by increasing Trk function (28Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 38Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyada T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3074-3080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). When compared with BDNF, both GM1 and NMDA elicit a modest increase in Trk tyrosine phosphorylation; however, both compounds prevent glutamate excitotoxicity, suggesting that there could be cross-talk between two or more signaling pathways resulting in a synergism or potentiation of the effect, perhaps via different substrates. In addition, the neuroprotective effect of NMDA may also involve other neurotrophic factors. A most likely candidate is basic fibroblast growth factor, a trophic factor known to prevent glutamate toxicity (40Mattson M.P. Murrain M. Guthrie P.B. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3728-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) whose expression is induced in cerebellar granule cells (41Marini A.M. Spiga G. Mocchetti I. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Future experiments will examine the possible role of other neurotrophic factors in NMDA-mediated neuronal protection. In addition to the neuroprotective activity, BDNF also modulates both acute and long-term synaptic function (42Lo D.C.

Our observation that NMDA increases BDNF release and the consequent TrkB activation suggests a correlation between activity-dependent synaptic remodeling, neuronal growth, and differentiation (4Ghosh A.

It will be important to establish whether similar mechanisms are operative in fully mature neurons and whether activation of other neurotransmitter receptors, such as β-adrenergic receptors, which are known to increase neurotrophin synthesis (47Follesa P. Mocchetti I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 132-138PubMed Google Scholar), can alter neuronal plasticity and therefore contribute to synaptic reorganization. We thank Dr. G.

Here we describe the solution structure of the N-terminal DH domain of Trio that catalyzes nucleotide exchange for Rac1. The all-α-helical protein has a very different structure compared to other exchange factors. Based on site-directed mutagenesis, functionally important residues of the DH domain were identified. They are all highly conserved and reside in close proximity on two α helices. In addition, we have discovered a unique capability of the PH domain to enhance nucleotide exchange in DH domain–containing proteins."

This fragment was used as a probe to isolate a cDNA clone with an open reading frame encoding 446 amino acids from a M. alpina library. Expression of this open reading frame from an inducible promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of various substrates revealed that the recombinant product had Δ5-desaturase activity. The effects of growth and induction conditions as well as host strain on activity of the recombinant Δ5-desaturase in S. cerevisiae were evaluated. Expression of the M. alpina Δ5-desaturase cDNA in transgenic canola seeds resulted in the production of taxoleic acid (Δ5,9–18:2) and pinolenic acid (Δ5,9,12–18:3), which are the Δ5-desaturation products of oleic and linoleic acids, respectively.

The long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA)1 play important roles in adult as well as infant nutrition because they serve as precursors of eicosanoids including prostaglandins and leukotrienes. They are also necessary for membrane structure and function, regulation of cholesterol metabolism and infant brain development (1Horrobin D.F. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 163-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). There are two main families of LC-PUFAs, the n-6 and n-3 families, which are synthesized through an alternating series of desaturations and elongations beginning with either linoleic acid (LA, Δ9,12–18:2) or α-linolenic acid (ALA, Δ9,12,15–18:3), respectively (Fig. 1). The major end point of the n-6 pathway in mammals is arachidonic acid (AA, Δ5,8,11,14–20:4) and major end points of the n-3 pathway are eicosapentaenoic acid (Δ5,8,11,14,17–20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (Δ4,7,10,13,16,19–22:6). Although in most cases animals contain the enzymatic activity to convert LA and ALA to LC-PUFAs, they lack the Δ12- and Δ15-desaturase activities necessary to convert oleic acid (Δ9–18:1) to LA and ALA. Thus, LA and ALA are considered essential fatty acids in the human diet. There are instances, however where the rate of conversion of LA and ALA to LC-PUFAs is limiting (1Horrobin D.F. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 163-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and thus there is an interest in dietary supplementation with some or all of these LC-PUFAs. LC-PUFAs are widely distributed in nature (1Horrobin D.F. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 163-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 2Gunstone F.D. Harwood J.L. Padley F.B. The Lipid Handbook. 2nd Ed. Chapman & Hill, London1994Google Scholar). γ-Linolenic acid (Δ6,9,12–18:3) can be found in seeds of plants such as borage, evening primrose, and blackcurrant as well as fungi such asMucor and Mortierella spp., and blue-green algae (Spirulina, Synechocystis). AA can be found in significant amounts in animal liver and adrenal gland, and is also produced in microorganisms such as Mortierella alpina and Porphyridium cruentum (2Gunstone F.D. Harwood J.L. Padley F.B. The Lipid Handbook. 2nd Ed. Chapman & Hill, London1994Google Scholar). Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid can be found in fish oil and other marine organisms. None of these sources is particularly well suited for use in human nutrition, however. The species of plants that contain γ-linolenic acid are not agronomically suitable for large scale cultivation; growth of LC-PUFA-containing microorganisms is not economically attractive. The ability to produce these valuable LC-PUFAs in an easily cultured, edible microorganism would be of considerable interest. Alternatively, since plant oils are currently the largest source of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the human diet, modification of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway to produce LC-PUFAs in an oilseed crop would also provide an economical, renewable source of these important fatty acids. Production of polyunsaturated fatty acids in plants is catalyzed by membrane-bound desaturases that act on glycerolipid substrates in both the plastid and endoplasmic reticulum (3Browse J. Somerville C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 467-506Crossref Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Commercial oilseed crops such as canola contain only Δ12- and Δ15-desaturases; no Δ6- or Δ5-desaturation-derived PUFAs are present in the oil. Genetic techniques have led to the identification of the genes encoding the Δ12- and Δ15-desaturases from Arabidopsis thaliana (4Okuley J. Lightner J. Feldmann K. Yadav N. Lark E. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar,5Arondel V. Lemieux B. Hwang I. Gibson S. Goodman H.M. Somerville C.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1353-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarities, several examples of cDNAs and genes encoding these enzymes have been cloned from other higher plant species. An ω-3-desaturase has recently been cloned fromCaenorhabditis elegans (6Spychalla J.P. Kinney A.J. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Δ6-Desaturase clones have been identified in cyanobacteria (7Reddy A.S. Nuccio M.L. Gross L.M. Thomas T.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Murata N. Deshnium P. Tasaka Y. Huang Y. Milles D.E. Gamma-linolenic Acid, Metabolism and Its Roles in Nutrition and Medicine. AOC Press, Champaign, IL1996: 22-32Google Scholar), borage (9Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1998; 330: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A human gene with homology to membrane fatty acid desaturases has been identified (12Cadena D.L. Kurten R.C. Gill G.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6960-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although desaturase activity has not yet been demonstrated for this clone. Based on analogy to the higher plant enzymes, these desaturases are believed to be membrane-bound and require cytochrome b 5 and cytochrome b 5 reductase for activity. The most striking feature of these desaturase amino acid sequences is the presence of three histidine-rich regions that are conserved both in sequence and spacing relative to one another (8Murata N. Deshnium P. Tasaka Y. Huang Y. Milles D.E. Gamma-linolenic Acid, Metabolism and Its Roles in Nutrition and Medicine. AOC Press, Champaign, IL1996: 22-32Google Scholar, 9Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although various Δ12-, Δ15-, and Δ6- desaturases needed for synthesis of LC-PUFAs have been cloned, a gene encoding the Δ5-desaturase activity necessary for AA production has never been isolated. As the last step in the production of AA, the Δ5-desaturase is also critical for the production of the eicosanoids derived from AA, which play roles in regulating nearly all physiological activities. Several strains of filamentous fungi of the genusMortierella produce significant amounts of AA (13Yamada H. Shimizu S. Shinmen Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 785-790Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Large scale fermentation and culture conditions for M. alpina have been optimized, with AA content reaching 30–50% of total fatty acids (14Shinmen Y. Shimizu S. Akimoto K. Kawashima H. Yamada H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1989; 31: 11-16Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). M. alpina mutants for Δ12-, Δ6-, and Δ5-desaturases have been isolated and characterized (15Jareonkitmongkol S. Shimizu S. Yamada H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 997-1002Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Hence, this microbe was selected as the source of Δ5-desaturase. Bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which is incapable of producing LC-PUFA endogenously because of the absence of Δ12-, Δ15-, and Δ6- and Δ5-desaturases, was used as the host for expression of the fungal Δ5-desaturase cDNA. In this work we describe the isolation of a desaturase-like sequence from M. alpina and demonstrate its ability to produce Δ5-unsaturated fatty acids in bakers' yeast and transgenic canola seeds. M. alpina ATCC32221 was grown in PD medium (Difco). Cultures were inoculated on PDA plates and grown at room temperature. When plates were completely covered, the fungal growth was peeled off and cut into 1–2-cm squares. These squares were used to inoculate 1 liter of potato dextrose broth and shaken at 200 rpm at room temperature. TheS. cervisiae strain used was SC334, Matαpep4-3 prb1-1122 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 reg1-501 gal1 (16Hoveland P. Flick J. Johnston M. Sclafani R.A. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The reg1-501 mutation alleviates glucose repression of the GAL1 promoter in this strain. Total RNA was isolated from a 3-day-old culture of M. alpina using the protocol of Hoge et al. (17Hoge J.H.C. Springer J. Zantinge B. Wessels J.G.H. Exp. Mycol. 1982; 6: 225-232Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The RNA was used to prepare double-stranded cDNA using the λ-ZipLox system from Life Technologies, Inc. according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out at 45 °C using 40 μg of total RNA as described previously (18Knutzon D.S. Lardizabal K.D. Nelsen J.S. Bleibaum J.L. Davies H.M. Metz J.G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Double-stranded cDNAs were size fractionated by column chomatography. The two fractions containing the largest cDNAs were pooled and packaged to produce a library containing 3 × 106 clones with an average insert size of 1.8 kilobases. Library screening and plaque purification were carried out using standard protocols as described previously (18Knutzon D.S. Lardizabal K.D. Nelsen J.S. Bleibaum J.L. Davies H.M. Metz J.G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed for use as PCR primers. The forward primer contained all possible codons corresponding to the conserved amino acid sequence HHTYTN and had the following sequence: 5′-CUACUACUACUACA(C/T)CA(C/T)AC(I/C)TA(C/T)AC(I/C)AA(C/T)AT-3′. The reverse primer contained all possible codons corresponding to the conserved amino acid sequence HHLFP and had the following sequence: 5′- CAUCAUCAUCAU(I/C)GG(A/G)AA(I/C)A(A/G)(A/G)TG(A/G)TG-3′. Template for PCR was generated by reverse transcription of 5 μg of total M. alpina RNA using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the primer: 5′-CCAAGCTTCTGCAGGAGCTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′. PCR amplification was conducted in a Perkin-Elmer GeneAMP PCR system 9600 instrument in a 25-μl volume containing a template derived from 40 ng of total RNA, 2 pm each primer, 200 μm each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, 60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 15 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgCl2. Samples were subjected to an initial denaturation step of 95 °C for 5 min and then held at 75 °C, while 0.2 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) was added. Amplification took place using 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1.5 min at 45 °C, 2 min at 72 °C. Following amplification, PCR products were subcloned into pAMP1 using the CLONEAMP system from Life Technologies, Inc. The PCR clones were used as probes with M. alpina cDNA library to identify full-length cDNA clones. The full-length cDNA from M. alpina encoding desaturase-like gene in pZL1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was amplified using PCR with the forward primer RO-145 (5′-AATCTGAAGCTT ATGGGAACGGACCAAGGAAAAACCTTC-3′) and the reverse primer RO-146 (5′-TTCCAAGAATTC CTACTCTTCCTTGGGACGGAGTCCAAG-3′) homologous to the beginning and end, respectively, of the open reading frame in the longest cDNA clone (see “Results”). TheHindIII site (underlined) in the forward primer was placed just upstream of the translational initiation codon (shown in boldface), and the EcoRI site (underlined) was placed immediately downstream of the termination codon (complimentary bases shown in boldface) of this open reading frame. TheHindIII/EcoRI gene fragment was cloned in yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) downstream of the GAL1 promoter, and the clone was designated pCGR4. Transformation of S. cervisiae was done using a PEG/LiAc protocol (19Stearns T. Ma H. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 280-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by plating on synthetic medium plates lacking uracil (16Hoveland P. Flick J. Johnston M. Sclafani R.A. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and grown overnight in minimal medium containing 2% glucose and lacking uracil at 30 °C. Two to four ml of the overnight culture were used to inoculate 100 ml of minimal medium containing 2% glucose and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA, Δ8,11,14–20:3) or other fatty acid substrates but lacking uracil. Each culture was grown at 30 °C and induced with 2% galactose at 15 °C for 48–52 h (unless otherwise indicated) and subsequently harvested by centrifiguration. Cell pellets were washed once with sterile doubled-distilled H2O to remove the medium and used for fatty acid analysis. The host strain transformed with vector alone was used as a negative control in all experiments. For cloning in plant expression vectors, the coding region of theM. alpina desaturase gene was PCR-amplified using the following primers: 5′-CUACUACUACUACTCGAGCAAGATGGGAACGGACCAAGG-3′ and 5′-CAUCAUCAUCAUCTCGAG CTACTCTTCCTTGGGACGGAG-3′. These primers introduced XhoI cloning sites (underlined) upstream and downstream of the start and stop codons (in boldface), repsectively. The PCR product was subcloned into pAMP1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the open reading frame was verified by sequencing of both strands. The XhoI fragment containing the desaturase coding region was inserted into the napin expression cassette, pCGN3223 (20Kridl J.C. McCarter D.W. Rose R.E. Scherer D.E. Knutzon D.S. Radke S.E. Knauf V.C. Seed Sci. Res. 1991; 1: 209-219Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), that had been linearized with SalI. The HindIII fragment of the resulting plasmid containing the napin 5′-regulatory region, M. alpina desaturase coding region, and napin 3′- regulatory region was inserted into theHindIII site of pCGN1557 (21McBride K.E. Summerfelt K.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) to create pCGN5530. The plasmid pCGN5530 was digested with HindIII and religated at a high DNA concentration to produce a tandem expression construct, pCGN5531. This construct contains two copies of the napin/M. alpina desaturase gene fusion oriented in the same direction with respect to transcription of the nptII selection gene. pCGN5531 was transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 and used to transform Brassica napus cv. LP004 as described by Radkeet al. (22Radke S.E. Andrews B.M. Moloney M.M. Crouch M.L. Kridl J.C. Knauf V.K. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1987; 75: 685-694Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Fatty acid contents of yeast cells expressing M. alpina desaturase gene, in the presence of various substrates, were analyzed. The rate of conversion of substrate to product was considered to be directly proportional to the expression/activity of a given desaturase in the yeast cell assay system. Washed yeast pellets were vortexed with 15 ml of methanol. After addition of approximately 100 μg of tridecanoin and 29 ml of choloroform, the mixture was incubated for at least 1 h at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight. The mixture was transferred to a 250-ml separatory funnel. The extraction tube was rinsed twice with 5 ml of water to recover residual material and added to the separatory funnel. The lipids segregated to the lower chloroform layer were filtered though a Whatman filter with 1 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove particulates and residual water. The organic solvents were evaporated to dryness at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen. Triglycerides and total phospholipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography developed with a solvent system of hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v). The extracted lipids or lipid fractions were derivatized to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) by adding 2 ml of 0.5 n potassium hydroxide in methanol to a closed tube. The samples were heated to 95–100 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature. Approximately 2 ml of 14% boron trifluoride in methanol was added, and heating was repeated. After the mixture was cooled, 2 ml of water and 1 ml of hexane were added in order to extract the FAME. The fatty acid composition was then analyzed with a fused silica capillary column (Supelcomega, 50 m × 0.25 mm inside diameter, Supelco, Belfonte, PA) in Hewlett-Packard 5890 II Plus gas chromatograph. The condition for gas chromatographic analysis was as described previously (23Huang Y.S. Smith R.S. Redden P.R. Cantrill R.C. Horrobin D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1082: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was carried out using a Hewlett-Packard mass selective detector (model 5972) operating at an ionization voltage of 70 eV with a scan range of 20–500 Da. The mass spectrum of any new peak obtained was compared with that of standards (Nu Chek Prep, Elysian, MN) in the data base NBS75K.L (National Bureau of Standards). In order to isolate various M. alpina desaturase sequences we designed degenerate oligonucleotide primers for use in PCR. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of known acyl lipid desaturases reveals three main regions of similarity, including 8 conserved histidine residues (Fig. 2 A) (10Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). PCR amplification of M. alpina cDNA using degenerate primers corresponding to the sequences HHTYTN found in the second His box of cyanobacterial Δ6-desaturases (amino acid residues 127–132 of theSynechocystis Δ6-desaturase (Fig. 2 A) (7Reddy A.S. Nuccio M.L. Gross L.M. Thomas T.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Murata N. Deshnium P. Tasaka Y. Huang Y. Milles D.E. Gamma-linolenic Acid, Metabolism and Its Roles in Nutrition and Medicine. AOC Press, Champaign, IL1996: 22-32Google Scholar)) and HHLFP found in the 3rd His box of many desaturases (amino acid residues 306–310 of the Synechocystis Δ6-desaturase and 308–312 of the Arabidopsis Δ15-desaturase (Fig. 2 A) (10Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) resulted in the production of a 550-base pair fragment. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of this fragment to protein sequence data banks indicated homology to the Δ6-desaturases from Synechocystis spp. and Spirulina spp. The PCR fragment was used as a probe to isolate corresponding cDNA clones from a library. The longest cDNA isolated, designated pCGN5521, was 1481 base pairs and contained an open reading frame encoding 446 amino acids. The sequence of the PCR-derived probe was entirely contained within pCGN5521. BLAST analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of pCGN5521 revealed significant matches to the cyanobacterial Δ6-desaturases, however the sequence can be aligned with other membrane-bound desaturases as well (Fig. 2 A). The M. alpina sequence contains the three His boxes found in other membrane-bound desaturases, but the third HXXHH motif is changed to QXXHH in this clone. This change to Q residue in the motif is also found in Δ6-desaturases from Synechocystis spp. and borage. Fig. 2 B shows the alignment of the N-terminal sequences of theM. alpina and borage desaturases with those of cytochromeb 5 proteins from a variety of species. Similar to the borage clone, this desaturase-like sequence from M. alpina contains an N-terminal cytochome b 5domain not found in cyanobacterial Δ6-desaturase sequences. Analysis of the hydrophobicity profile of the protein encoded by pCGN5521 using TopPred II (24Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) predicts multiple transmembrane stretches as would be expected for an integral membrane protein. The recombinant yeast strain SC334(pCGR-4) was grown with 100 μm of various substrates in the selective media after induction, and new fatty acids formed in the lipid fraction were analyzed to determine the substrate specificity of the cloned enzyme. When the substrate used was DGLA, the conversion to AA was monitored to determine Δ5-desaturase activity. With linoleic acid as the added substrate, conversions to γ-linolenic acid and ALA were monitored to indicate Δ6-desaturase and Δ15-desaturase activities, respectively. AA was also used as a substrate to monitor conversion to eicosapentaenoic acid to determine if the clone exhibited the Δ17-desaturase activity. In addition, conversion of endogenous oleic acid in this strain to LA in the absence of any added substrate was monitored as an indication of Δ12-desaturase activity. The results in Fig. 3 show the accumulation of a new fatty acid in the lipid fraction of yeast containing pCGR4 grown in the presence of exogenous DGLA, but not in yeast strain containing the vector pYES2 (Fig. 3, panels A and B). The retention time (22.32 min) of this new fatty acid was identical to that of authentic AA. The GC-MS analysis indicates that this compound has a mass peak at m/z = 318 (the expected molecular ion for 20:4), and a fragmentation pattern identical to that of the authentic Δ5,8,11,14–20:4 standard (Fig. 4). When incubated with other exogenous fatty acid substrates, SC334(pCGR4) strain did not exhibit any Δ6-, Δ12-, Δ15-, or Δ17-desaturase activity (data not shown). Therefore, it was concluded that the cloned fragment of cDNA fromM. alpina expressed a Δ5-desaturase activity in yeast.Figure 4GC-MS analysis of the new peak in the lipid fraction of the recombinant yeast.

No accumulation of AA above the background level was observed in the negative control strain, SC334(pYES2). In addition, DGLA was incorporated in significant quantities in the lipid fraction of this recombinant yeast strain. When the distribution of DGLA and AA formed in the major lipid fractions in SC334(pCGR4) grown in the presence of DGLA were examined, approximately 80% of AA produced by Δ5-desaturase and 30% of incorporated DGLA accumulated in the phospholipid fraction (data not shown).Table IProduction of AA in yeast lipid fractionSC334 containingTotal fatty acid1-aThe volume of culture used for lipid extraction was 100 ml.AADGLA1-bExogenous DGLA concentration used was 100 μm.μg% wt% wtpCGR4309.46.15.1pYES2287.70.314.31-a The volume of culture used for lipid extraction was 100 ml.1-b Exogenous DGLA concentration used was 100 μm. Open table in a new tab When grown in the absence of exogenous substrate (i.e.DGLA), a new fatty acid was detected in the GC-FAME profile of SC334(pCGR4) compared with that of SC334(pYES2) (Fig. 5 A). GC-MS analysis indicates this fatty acid has a mass peak at m/z = 294 (the expected molecular ion of 18:2), and a fragmentation pattern very similar to those of Δ6,9–18:2 and Δ9,12–18:2 (Fig. 5 B). However, this new fatty acid has a retention time at approximately 18 min (Fig. 5 A), which was different from that of Δ6,9–18:2 (16.89 min) and that of Δ9,12–18:2 (17.28 min). These findings suggest that the new fatty acid, which could be detected only in SCC334(pCGR4) yeast expressing the Δ5-desaturase activity, was an isomer of 18:2 and most likely the Δ5,9–18:2 or taxoleic acid. To verify its ability to function as a Δ5-desaturase in higher plants, the M. alpina cDNA was introduced into a low linolenic variety of Brassica napus under control of the seed-specific napin promoter (20Kridl J.C. McCarter D.W. Rose R.E. Scherer D.E. Knutzon D.S. Radke S.E. Knauf V.C. Seed Sci. Res. 1991; 1: 209-219Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The fatty acid composition of pools of mature T2 seeds from thirty independent transformation events were analyzed. Fig. 6 shows the GC-FAME profile of the fatty acids from one such transformant. AA, the normal product of Δ5-desaturase, was not present and was not expected since canola does not contain DGLA, the normal substrate for the desaturase. When compared with the GC-FAME profile of the fatty acids from a pool of control seeds (data not shown), two new peaks, shown by thearrows in Fig. 6, were observed in the profile obtained from the transformant. The new fatty acid, indicated by the solid arrow, had the same retention time as the new peak observed in the recombinant yeast strain (Fig. 5 A). Mass spectroscopic analysis (data not shown) indicated that this new peak (solid arrow) has a mass peak at m/z of 294, and a fragmentation pattern identical to that seen in the new fatty acid observed in the recombinant yeast strain (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest that this peak was taxoleic acid (Δ5,9–18:2). The second new peak, as indicated by the open arrow, appeared to be a molecule, whose methyl ester has a mass peak at m/z of 292, the expected molecular ion of a 18-carbon fatty acid with three double bonds. The fragmentation pattern of this new fatty acid was very similar to that of the authentic Δ6,9,12–18:3 standard (data not shown); however, the retention time of this peak in GC was somewhat different from the standard. This peak was tentatively identified as pinolenic acid (Δ5,9,12–18:3). Both Δ5,9–18:2 and Δ5,9,12–18:3 are the Δ5-desaturation products of oleic and linoleic acid, respectively, the two most abundant fatty acids in canola oil. Of the 30 transgenic plants analyzed, 24 contained detectable levels of taxoleic acid, ranging from 0.9 to 6.21% of the total fatty acids in the seed pools. A desaturase-like cDNA was cloned from a fungal species,M. alpina, by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotide primers. The predicted amino acid sequence encoded by this cDNA contains the highest homology to previously reported cyanobacterial Δ6-desaturases, although similarity to other higher plant and animal membrane-bound desaturases is observed as well. Expression of thisM. alpina cDNA in both recombinant yeast cells and transgenic plants demonstrates its ability to introduce a Δ5 double bond into both 18- and 20-carbon substrates. The M. alpinaΔ5-desaturase sequence contains two features that distinguish it from the group of Δ12- and Δ15-desaturases and would seem to place it in a newly emerging Δ5/Δ6 class. The first characteristic of this class is the presence of an N-terminal cytochromeb 5 domain (Fig. 2 B). This domain is similar to that seen in the Δ6-desaturases from borage (9Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and C. elegans (11Napier J.A. Hey S.J. Lacey D.J. Shewry P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as well as a desaturase-like sequence isolated from sunflower (25Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This feature would appear to be of some functional importance due to the role of cytochromeb 5 in electron transport of at least some membrane-bound desaturases and related hydroxylases (26Smith M.A. Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Griffiths W.T. Stymne S. Stobart K. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Smith M.A. Jonsson L. Stymne S. Stobart K. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The second distinguishing characteristic of the Δ5/Δ6 class of desaturases is the QXXHH sequence at the third His box (Fig. 2 A). This also would appear to be functionally significant, due to the proposed role of these conserved histidines in the ligation of iron atoms (10Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The precise biological or functional ramifications of these characteristics remains to be demonstrated, however. These characteristics of the Δ5/Δ6 desaturases could be related to either the form of substrate utilized or the type of reaction carried out. As discussed by Napier et al. (11Napier J.A. Hey S.J. Lacey D.J. Shewry P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), both the Δ5- and Δ6-desaturases carry out a so-called “front-end desaturation.” Expression of the Δ5-desaturase from M. alpina in S. cerevisiae indicated that a polyunsaturated fatty acid of 20-carbon length could accumulate in significant quantities in bakers' yeast (Table I) without any major growth problems. In separate experiments with 25 μm exogenous DGLA, accumulation of AA in SC334(pCGR4) reached as high as 22% of the total lipids (data not shown). In addition, the phospholipid fraction of SC334(pCGR4) contained significant proportions of substrate and product PUFAs for Δ5-desaturase activity. Hence, it appears that the substrate is accessible in the phospholipid form to the Δ5-desaturase. Since AA was stored in the phospholipid fraction of yeast, the quantity of AA produced in yeast is limited by the amount that can be stored in the phospholipid fraction. If AA could also be stored in other fractions such as the triacylglycerol fraction in an oleogenous yeast strain, the level of AA produced in the yeast strain might be increased. The M. alpina Δ5-desaturase was also able to function in seeds of transgenic Brassica plants to produce taxoleic and pinolenic acids in plant oils. Taxoleic acid, the Δ5-desaturation product of oleic acid, reached levels of up to 6% of the total fatty acids in pooled seed samples. This may, in effect, be an under-representation of the amount of Δ5-desaturase activity present in these seeds, as the rate of activity of the desaturase on an 18-carbon monounsaturated substrate may be less than that of the authentic Δ8,11,14–20:3 substrate, DGLA. Δ5-Polyunsaturated fatty acids are found in a wide variety of conifer species (28Takagi T. Itabashi Y. Lipids. 1982; 17: 716-723Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar); however, studies of the biological effects of these fatty acids have been limited and few commercial sources exist (29Wolff R.L. INFORM. 1997; 8: 116-119Google Scholar). It is also significant that the fungal desaturase is able to efficiently interact with the components of Brassica seed triacylglycerol assembly. The M. alpina Δ5-desaturase shows considerable sequence similarity to the ArabidopsisΔ12- and Δ15-desaturases (Fig. 2 A), which are known to utilize membrane glycerolipids as substrates (30Browse J. McConn M. James D. Miquel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16345-16351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This, in addition to the finding that the AA produced in recombinant yeast accumulates primarily in the phospholipid fraction, suggest that the M. alpina Δ5-desaturase is also a glycerolipid desaturase. This raises the possibility that the other desaturases involved in LC-PUFA synthesis in M. alpina would also be compatible with theBrassica machinery. The ability to use the M. alpina Δ5-desaturase in the production of LC-PUFAs such as AA in plant oils, such as canola, would create an economical and agronomically viable source of these valuable fatty acids."

Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). In its inactive state, NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm, bound to the inhibitory protein, IκBα which masks the transcription factor's nuclear localization sequence (3Thanos D. Maniatis T.

A number of kinases which directly serine phosphorylate IκBα prior to proteosomal degradation, are in hand (7DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Other serine kinases, however, such as casein kinase II, readily phosphorylate IκBα, yet such phosphorylation does not lead to signal-induced degradation of the inhibitory protein (12Barroga C.F. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7637-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that pervanadate (pV) activates NF-κB, specifically in Jurkat T cells. This event, however, involves tyrosine rather than serine phosphorylation of IκBα. Similar to serine/threonine phosphorylation induced by casein kinase II, IκBα, when tyrosine phosphorylated by pV, is not rapidly degraded (13Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31049-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation thus appears to prevent degradation of IκBα. On the other hand, NF-κB activation via tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα has not been shown to be induced by a natural agonist and its physiological relevance, if any, is unknown (13Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F.

The osteoclastogenic cytokine, TNF, exerts much of its transcriptional impact by activating NF-κB (15Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hsu H. Shu H. Pan M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). In some circumstances, TNF also signals via tyrosine kinases (17Weber C. Negrescu E. Erl W.

We find such is the case regarding TNF induction of NF-κB in BMMs. We document c-Src, which stably associates with the inhibitory protein following TNF treatment of BMMs, is the cytokine-induced IκBα tyrosine kinase. c-Src phosphorylates IκBα on tyrosine 42, and such phosphorylation mobilizes NF-κB which translocates to the nucleus. The physiological relevance of c-Src-mediated IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation is underscored by delayed and diminished TNF-induced activation of NF-κB and curtailed expression of the NF-κB dependent cytokine, IL-6, in c-src−/− BMMs. Monoclonal antibody 327 (20Lipsich L.A.

Shaw (Dept. of Pathology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Polyclonal anti-IκBα, anti-p50NF-κB, and anti-p65NF-κB antibodies and c-Src specific substrate, p34, were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine and polyclonal anti-c-Src antibodies were purchased from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Recombinant murine TNF (specific activity 1.1 × 108 units/mg) was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). In all experiments involving TNF, 10 ng/ml cytokine was used which we have show to be inductive of murine BMM c-Src expression (19Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). ECL kit was obtained from Amersham Corp. (Arlington Heights, IL). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. C3H/HeN males (Harlan Industries, Indianapolis, IN) and those in which the c-src gene was deleted (21Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) were used. BMMs were isolated from whole bone marrow of 4–6-week-old mice and incubated in tissue culture plates, at 37 °C in 5% CO2, in the presence of colony stimulating factor-1 (1,000 units/ml) (22Clohisy D.R. Chappel J.C. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5370-5377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h in culture, the non-adherent cells were collected and layered on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient and the cells at the gradient interface were collected and plated in α-minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence of colony stimulating factor-1 (1,000 units/ml), and plated according to each experimental conditions. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy Pontoise, France). Adherent cells were scraped from the dish in the presence of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.2% deoxycholic acid, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.02% NaN3, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm AEBSF, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm NaVO4), and incubated at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 30 min. The cells were then passed through a 25-gauge needle and spun at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. Lysates were precleared with excess of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Cleared lysates were incubated with various antibodies or non-immune serum followed by protein A or G beads, as indicated in each experiment, and the beads containing immune complexes were washed extensively with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins or total cell lysates were boiled in the presence of SDS sample buffer (0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, distilled water) for 5 min and subjected to electrophoresis on 8–12% SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and incubated in blocking solution (10% skim milk prepared in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), to reduce nonspecific binding. Membranes were washed with PBS/Tween buffer and exposed to primary antibodies (1 h at room temperature up to overnight at 4 °C), washed again four times, and incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1 h, room temperature). Membranes were washed extensively (5 × 15 min), and an ECL detection assay was performed following the manufacturer's directions. The method described by Clark and Brugge (24Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) was followed, with slight modifications. Beads containing immunoprecipitated c-Src were washed with kinase lysis buffer (1.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μmNaVO3) and then preincubated with 15 μl of kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 μm NaVO3), for 10 min at 22 °C. The kinase reaction was started by addition of 5 μCi of [32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham), 5 μmATP, 1 μg of p34 c-Src substrate (all final concentrations). The reaction was terminated after 2 min by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer and heating at 65 °C for 5 min. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and exposed to film. These conditions were established in our hands (25Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Schlesinger P. Tondravi M.M.

COS cells were seeded at 25% confluency on 6-well plates 24 h before transfection. After washing with PBS, transfection was carried out in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% Nu-serum (CBP, Bedford, MA) supplemented with 200 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia), 100 μm chloroquine (Sigma), and 1.5 μg of each vector for 4 h. Dimethyl sulfoxide (10%) was then added for 2 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h before harvest and further analysis. Nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (26Tetsuka T. Srivastava S.K. Morrison A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, untreated or TNF-stimulated monolayers of BMMs grown in 100-mm2 tissue culture dish were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lifted from the dish by treating with 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA in PBS. Cells were then resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 15 min, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.64%. Nuclei were pelleted and the cytosolic fraction was carefully removed. The nuclei were then resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin), vortexed for 30 s, and rotated for 30 min in 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged and the nuclear proteins in the supernatant were transferred to fresh tubes and protein content was measured using standard BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with an end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the sequence 5′-AAACAGGGGGCTTTCCCTCCTC-3′ (27Drouet C. Shakhov A.N. Jongeneel C.V. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1694-1700PubMed Google Scholar) derived from the κB3 site of the TNF promoter. The reaction was performed in a total of 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol) for 15–20 min at room temperature. For supershift assay, the nuclear extract was incubated with specific antibodies for 30 min before addition of the labeled probe. After incubation with the labeled probe for an additional 30 min, samples were fractionated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposing dried gel to film.

These observations prompted us to determine if NF-κB activation and c-Src induction by the cytokine, in osteoclast precursors, are functionally related. As seen in Fig. 1,a and b, TNF treatment (10 ng/ml) of wild type (WT) BMMs promotes rapid shift of the transcription factor from cytoplasm to nucleus. In contrast, NF-κB nuclear translocation, in cytokine-treated BMMs derived from mice deleted of c-src, is markedly reduced and delayed (Fig. 1 b, src−/−). The fact that TNF activation of an alternative pathway, involving c-Jun N-terminal kinase, is unaltered in c-src−/− cells (not shown) indicates failure to activate NF-κB in these mutants does not represent a global signaling defect. The functional significance of TNF induced NF-κB nuclear translocation is supported by the appearance, in nuclear extracts, of a moiety recognizing the κB3 sequence of the TNF promoter (TNF-κB3) (Fig. 1 c). Consistent with retarded nuclear translocation of NF-κB in c-src−/− BMMs, appearance of TNF-κB3 binding activity is delayed at least 3-fold in mutant animals. Thus, while alternative mechanisms exist for slower TNF activation of NF-κB, its immediate mobilization requires c-Src. NF-κB consists of various combinations of Rel family transcription factors, the most common being the p50/RelA dimer. To determine if this complex is induced by TNF treatment of BMMs, nuclear extracts were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), in the presence and absence of anti-p50 and -RelA antibodies, using as probe, the κB3 response element of the TNF promoter (Fig. 2 a). While nuclear NF-κB, in untreated BMMs, consists largely of p50 homodimers (compare lanes 1 and 2 versus 1 and 3), inclusion of both antibodies, in assays containing nuclear extract of TNF treated BMMs, markedly reduces the intensity of the band migrating with NF-κB. Thus, the TNF induced DNA binding moiety contains both p50 and RelA. Our data, however, do not exclude the possibility that additional NF-κB/Rel family members form the TNF-induced complex in BMMs. Competition with non-radiolabeled TNF-κB3 and the NF-κB response element derived from the HIV1 promoter (HIV1-κB), establishes specificity of the EMSA probe (Fig. 2 b). Similarly, a mutated HIV1-κB (mut.HIV1-κB) oligonucleotide fails to compete with TNF-κB3. BMMs differentiate, in defined circumstances, into bone-resorbing osteoclasts (31Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Kodama H. Martin T.J. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Such commitment involves local secretion of selected cytokines, particularly IL-6 (32Passeri G. Girasole G. Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. Bone Miner. 1994; 24: 109-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). IL-6 is NF-κB-induced (33Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Galien R. Garcia T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2424-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and the product of exposure to TNF, itself a potent osteoclastogenic agent (19Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 35Bertolini D.R. Nedwin G.E. Bringman T.S. Smith D.D. Mundy G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Thus, our finding that c-src−/− BMMs inadequately secrete IL-6 in response to TNF (Fig. 3) is consistent with failure of these cells to normally activate NF-κB when exposed to the latter cytokine and underscores the physiological relevance of TNF induced c-Src. We have shown that c-Src protein is substantially increased in BMMs following 24 h exposure to TNF (19Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The rapidity with which TNF induces NF-κB translocation in a c-Src-dependent manner (10 min) suggests the cytokine may prompt a more immediate appearance of the proto-oncogene. In fact, exposure of BMMs, for 10 min, to TNF induces a 60-kDa protein which immunoprecipitates, and is reactive by immunoblot, with anti-c-Src mAb (Fig. 4 a). Establishing kinase activity, the 60-kDa protein undergoes autophosphorylation and phosphorylates exogenous substrate when subjected to in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4 b). While c-Src protein is unchanged with 10–60 min exposure to TNF (Fig. 4 a), its kinase activity progressively increases (Fig. 4 b). Measured as a function of autophosphorylation (Fig. 4 b) relative to protein expression (Fig. 4 a), densitometric analysis confirms that c-Src specific activity increases 210% between 10 and 30 min and 320% between 10 and 60 min of TNF exposure. The rapidity of c-Src induction and activation is in keeping with the functional role played by the proto-oncogene in TNF mobilization of NF-κB. Having verified TNF rapidly induces c-Src as an active kinase whose deletion impairs NF-κB activation in BMMs, we turned to the mechanisms by which c-Src activates the transcription factor. These experiments focused on the inhibitory protein, IκBα. While TNF fails to alter IκBα expression (Fig. 5 a, WT), exposure of BMMs to the cytokine rapidly leads to its tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5 b, WT). This observation, taken with the fact TNF induces c-Src expression (Fig. 4) and activates NF-κB (Fig. 1) synchronously with tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα, raises the possibility the proto-oncogene is, in this circumstance, the IκBα tyrosine kinase. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of BMMs derived from c-src−/− mice. Suggesting a central role of c-Src in IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα in mutant cells, exposed to TNF, fails to undergo enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5 b, src−/−), while expression of the protein is unaffected (Fig. 5 a, src−/−). Due to poor efficiency and cell death following lysosomal uptake of double-stranded DNA (36Lebleu B. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 109-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Stacey K.J. Ross I.L. Hume D.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of protein in primary BMMs, using cDNA transfection, is a formidable challenge. Thus, to identify the IκBα tyrosine residue phosphorylated by c-Src, we transfected COS cells with c-Src and various IκBα-mutated cDNAs (Fig. 6) (13Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). We find c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα occurs on tyrosine 42. Tyrosine kinase activity was induced by either vanadate (VO4) or pV. VO4 and pV promote IκBα phosphorylation in cells transfected with c-Src and wild type IκBα but not with the Y42F mutant (Fig. 6). The fact that mutation of serines 32 and 36 (S32/36A), the sites of traditional IκBα phosphorylation (6Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), does not preclude c-Src-induced phosphorylation further confirms the target residue of c-Src is tyrosine 42. TNF-induced NF-κB activation, in BMMs, differs from the classical pathway involving serine phosphorylation of IκBα. This discrepancy prompted us to explore the specificity of the tyrosine kinase-mediated phenomenon. Establishing cytokine and gene specificity, interleukin-4, which activates NF-κB in B lymphocytes (38Yanagihara Y. Basaki Y. Ikizawa K. Kajiwara K. Koshio T. Akiyama K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: S224-S229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), fails to do so in BMMs, whether derived from c-Src expressing or deleted mice (Fig. 7 a). Furthermore, in contrast to NF-κB, TNF induction of PU.1, a DNA-binding osteoclastogenic transcription factor in BMMs, is independent of c-Src expression. More importantly, in contrast to TNF-treated BMMs in which mobilized IκBα is long lived (Figs. 5 and 8 c), exposure of U937 (Fig. 7 b), HeLa, and HepG2 cells (39Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

BMMs were exposed to TNF (10 ng/ml), with time, and lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα rabbit pcAb or anti-c-Src mouse mAb. The precipitates were blotted with:a, anti-c-Src rabbit pcAb; b, anti-IκBα rabbit pcAb; or c, anti-c-src mouse mAb. “C” in panel b, represents lysate from resting macrophages and in panel c, a c-Src-enriched preparation of platelet lysed in sample buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The observation that TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation is mediated by c-Src raises the likelihood of physical association between the inhibitory protein and tyrosine kinase. In fact, a 60-kDa protein, recognized by anti-c-Src polyclonal antibody (pcAb), immunoprecipitates with IκBα within 10 min of cytokine exposure (Fig. 8 a). Similarly, an anti-c-Src mAb immunoprecipitate, derived from TNF-treated cells, immunoblots with anti-IκBα pcAb (Fig. 8 b). To assess stability of the 60-kDa·IκBα complex, we exposed BMMs to TNF overnight. The cells were lysed and the lysate immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα or anti-c-Src antibodies. Mirroring the inductive effect of TNF on the proto-oncogene, the quantity of IκBα-associated protein, which immunoblots with anti-c-Src mAb and migrates with c-Src, is increased with prolonged cytokine exposure (Fig. 8 c). Thus, putative c-Src and IκBα remain associated for as long as 15 h in TNF-treated cells. The prolonged expression and activation of c-Src in response to TNF (19Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and, its extended connection with IκBα, suggest this association prompts prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation and perhapst½ of IκBα compared with the short survival of the serine-phosphorylated inhibitory protein. To establish the 60-kDa IκBα-associated moiety is, in fact, c-Src, we again lysed BMMs treated for 15 h, with TNF. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα or anti-c-Src antibodies and subjected to in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 9 a). Anti-IκBα and anti-c-Src antibodies each precipitate only 60-kDa TNF-induced bands, which exhibit similar patterns of progressive γ-32P incorporation and migrate with c-Src. As seen in Fig. 9 b, the anti-IκBα and anti-c-Src-phosphorylated immunoprecipitates yield identical patterns when subject to partial V8 protease digestion. Thus, TNF induces only one IκBα-associated kinase, namely c-Src. Because we have shown the experiment, as performed, represents c-Src mAb excess (19Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 25Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Schlesinger P. Tondravi M.M. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), 15 h of TNF treatment prompts approximately one-third of total BMM c-Src to associate with IκBα (Fig. 9 a, compare lanes 2 and 4). Furthermore, to obtain similar band intensities, equal radioactive counts (derived from lanes 2 and 4; Fig. 9 a) were loaded in lanes 1 and 2 (Fig. 9 b), respectively. The osteoclast is a macrophage-derived specialized polykaryon and the principal if not exclusive resorptive cell of bone (42Teitelbaum S.L. Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 43Teitelbaum S.L. Tondravi M.M. Ross F.P. Marcus R. Feldman D. Kelsey J. Osteoporosis. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 61-94Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which mononuclear precursors commit to the osteoclast phenotype are beginning to emerge and involve transcriptional regulators such as c-Fos (44Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) and PU.1 (45Tondravi M.M. McKercher S. Anderson K. Erdmann J.M. Quiroz M. Maki R. Teitelbaum S.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the importance of these regulatory proteins in osteoclast formation was revealed by the phenotype induced by their molecular deletion, namely osteopetrosis (44Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 45Tondravi M.M. McKercher S. Anderson K. Erdmann J.M. Quiroz M. Maki R. Teitelbaum S.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Recently, similar observations have been made following deletion of the p50/p52 heterodimer of the NF-κB/Rel family (28Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Young Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nature Med. 1997; 3: 1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src, is also an osteoclast regulatory protein, as absence of its gene prompts osteopetrosis (21Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar,30Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Src expression, by BMMs, is a marker of commitment to the osteoclast phenotype (19Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The fact that TNF exerts many of its effects by activating NF-κB (15Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hsu H. Shu H. Pan M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar), taken with the cytokine's unique capacity to induce c-Src in BMMs (19Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suggests the transcription complex and proto-oncogene participate in TNF's potent bone resorptive properties. This posture is in keeping with the subnormal activation of NF-κB and diminished induction of IL-6, by TNF, in c-src−/− BMMs. TNF enhancement of c-Src protein, in BMMs, occurs within 1 day of cytokine exposure (19Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In the present study, we find the quantity of the proto-oncogene, in BMM lysates, increases within 10 min of TNF treatment, an event rapidly followed by enhanced specific activity. The brisk appearance of the proto-oncogene following cytokine exposure precludes accelerated synthesis, but is consistent with the rate at which c-Src translocates, in other cells, between the insoluble and soluble compartments (24Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 46Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Varmus H.E. Morgan D.O. J.

Definitive documentation of the enzyme responsible for pV-mediated IκBα phosphorylation in Jurkat T cells is not yet in hand, but we established this event does not occur in cells lacking the c-Src family kinase, p56lck (13Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Furthermore, while enhanced Src activity, in other studies, correlates with NF-κB activation, a cause and effect relationship has not been previously established (51Eicher D.M. Tan T.H. Rice N.R. O'Shea J.J. Kennedy I.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2710-2719PubMed Google Scholar, 52Koong A.C. Chen E.Y. Mivechi N.F. Denko N.C. Stambrook P. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5273-5279PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα is a physiologically relevant means of activating NF-κB. The fact that TNF stimulated mobilization/activation of c-Src, as well as IκBα tyrosine phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, occur within the same time frame, in wild type but not c-src-deleted BMMs, provides compelling support for this hypothesis. In contrast to rapid degradation of serine-phosphorylated inhibitory protein (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5563) Google Scholar, 4Stancovski I.

Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), the quantity of IκBα does not substantially change with 30 min exposure of BMMs to TNF, indicating tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα is probably not subject to rapid proteolysis. The specificity of this event, as regards BMMs, is underscored by the fact that, in contrast to these authentic macrophages, TNF treatment of U937 cells (Fig. 7 b), among others (39Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 40Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13234-13238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), eventuates in rapid IκBα degradation. Furthermore, in the face of continuous TNF exposure, c-Src association with IκBα is long lasting. Given the abundance of the proto-oncogene in prolonged TNF-exposed BMMs (19Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), most of the inhibitory protein, as it is synthesized, may associate with c-Src, thus preventing IκBα binding the transcription factor. In vitro reconstitution experiments utilizing HeLa cell-derived extracts (14Singh S. Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31049-31054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) support our contention that tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα is, probably, protected from inducible degradation. It remains to be determined, however, if protection of IκBα reflects tyrosine phosphorylation, per se, or alternatively, c-Src association. Activation of NF-κB by interleukin-1 promotes osteoclast survival (56Jimi E. Nakamura I. Ikebe T. Akiyama S. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8799-8805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). More importantly, the osteoclast-deficient osteopetrotic lesion of the p50/p52 deleted mouse (28Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Young Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nature Med. 1997; 3: 1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) is in keeping with our hypothesis that TNF-induced osteoclastogenesis is NF-κB-mediated. The c-src−/− mouse is also osteopetrotic but, in contrast to the NF-κB knockout, contains numerous osteoclasts, incapable, however, of normal bone resorption (30Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). These disparate phenotypes may, at first glance, seem inconsistent with the posture that NF-κB-mediated osteoclastogenesis requires c-Src. The observations are, however, consonant with our finding that c-Src-independent activation of NF-κB, in BMMs, while extant, is reduced and delayed. This finding is analogous to that of Yeh et al. (57Yeh W. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) wherein TNF activation of NF-κB in TRAF2 deficient cells, is retarded. Consistent with the anti-apoptotic properties of NF-κB (58Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, 59Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar, 60Beg A.A.

Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its delayed mobilization is attended by enhanced TNF-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, we propose that expression of the complete osteoclast phenotype may require rapid activation of NF-κB as occurs with TNF induction of c-Src in BMMs. Delayed activation of the transcription factor, as obtained in a c-Src-independent manner may, on the other hand, be sufficient to prompt differentiation of BMMs into osteoclasts which are, however, dysfunctional. Regardless of whether this hypothesis proves true, we have identified a novel, c-Src-dependent mechanism by which TNF activates a transcription factor critical to osteoclastogenesis. We thank Drs. R. Schreiber and A. Shaw for helpful discussions, Dr. P. Schwartzberg for providing us with c-src−/− mice, and Marisol Quiroz for technical assistance."

In this report, we show that Smad3 and Smad4, through their MH1 domains, bind directly to a novel TGF-β-responsive sequence (TRS) in the human PAI-1 promoter that is associated with the ability to mediate strong transcriptional activation of this gene by TGF-β. These results demonstrate that Smad3 and Smad4 function as sequence-specific transcriptional activators in mediating transcriptional activation by TGF-β.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrevious analyses of the human PAI-1 promoter have mapped TGF-β-responsive elements to different regions and implicated different sequence-specific transcription factors in mediating TGF-β response in human hepatoma cell lines (20Keeton M.R.

To better understand how the TGF-β signal activates target genes, we first carried out mutational analyses of the PAI-1 promoter. Consistent with the observation of Keeton et al. (20Keeton M.R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), deletion of sequence between −740 and −700 from the PAI-1 promoter significantly reduced TGF-β induction from 30-fold to less than 4-fold, indicating that this region contains sequences that are required for optimal induction by TGF-β (data not shown). Therefore, this region was further characterized, and it was found that a 12-base pair (bp) sequence from −732 to −721 (AGACAAGGTTGT) is capable of conferring TGF-β responsiveness to a minimal promoter construct, pE1b-luc. A reporter construct containing four copies of this 12-bp TRS was induced more than 4-fold by TGF-β, whereas a construct containing six copies of TRS was induced nearly 40-fold by TGF-β (Fig. 1). In contrast, the same vector containing the E1b TATA box alone or six copies of sequence from −720 to −708 (TGACACAAGAGAG), containing a TRE-like sequence (20Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.-J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is unresponsive to TGF-β (Fig. 1). Point mutations and double or triple base substitutions in the TRS completely abrogated TGF-β responsiveness (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that the 12-bp TRS is both necessary and sufficient for mediating transcriptional responsiveness to TGF-β, thus defining this minimal TRS as a critical target for transcriptional activation by TGF-β.EMSA revealed the formation of two complexes with TRS (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4). Complex II is strongly enhanced by TGF-β, whereas complex I is relatively unchanged. Point mutations in TRS, which resulted in loss of TGF-β responsiveness (Fig. 1), eliminated the formation of both complexes (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–8). These results indicate that cellular proteins bind specifically to the TRS and that the formation of these complexes correlates with transcriptional activation by TGF-β.Figure 2Smad3 and Smad4 are components of the TGF-β-inducible complex formed on TRS.

C, the TGF-β-inducible complex (shift II) contains Smad4.

Supershift EMSA using anti-Smad3 and Smad4 antibodies revealed the presence of Smad3 and Smad4 in the TGF-β-inducible complex (II) but not in the TGF-β-independent complex (I) (Fig. 2, B and C). EMSA using cell extracts from COS cells transfected with expression vectors for Myc-Smad4 (8Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R.

The Smad4-dependent complex is supershifted by anti-Myc but not by the control anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 3), confirming the existence of Smad4 in the TRS-protein complex. Competition EMSA showed that the binding of Myc-Smad4 to TRS is specifically competed by wild type but not mutant TRS, demonstrating the specificity of the Smad4-TRS interaction (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results indicate that Smad3 and Smad4 are components of the TRS-binding complex.Figure 3Smad4 expressed in COS cells binds to TRS. Cell extracts from COS cells transfected with Myc-tagged Smad4 expression vector or empty vector were used. Oligonucleotides containing two copies of the wild type TRS were used as probe.Lanes 3-5 and 7-9 each contained 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 μg of anti-Myc antibody, respectively.Lanes 10-12 contained 2.8, 5.6, and 8.4 μg of control anti-Flag antibody, respectively. Lanes 13 and 14 and 15 and 16 contained 50 and 100 × molar excess of the wild type or mutant TRS as competitor, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next determined whether Smad3/4 could directly interact with TRS. EMSA using purified GST fusion proteins containing different regions of Smad4 demonstrated that the DNA binding is mediated by the MH1 domain of Smad4 (Fig. 4 A). A missense mutation (R100T) in the Smad4 MH1 domain, originally identified in a pancreatic carcinoma (23Schutte M. et al.Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2527-2530PubMed Google Scholar), has been reported to disrupt both growth inhibition and transcriptional activation by TGF-β (24Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Arg-100 in Smad4 corresponds to Arg-133 in Smad2 that is also mutated in colon carcinoma (25Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.-C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.

Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The R100T mutation completely eliminated TRS binding by Smad4 even when added at 100-fold greater concentration than the wild type protein (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). The wild type and mutant GST-Smad proteins were purified to similar purity (data not shown), and the exact same amount of each protein was used in the EMSA. Competition EMSA was performed to further establish the specificity and functional relevance of the Smad4-TRS interaction. Wild type TRS effectively competed the binding of Smad4 (Fig. 4 B); however, mutations in TRS that abolished its ability to mediate TGF-β responsiveness (Fig. 1) also abolished (m1, m2, m4) or substantially diminished (m3) its ability to compete for binding to Smad4. These results demonstrate that Smad4, either purifiedin vitro or expressed in vivo, binds specifically to the TRS and that the Smad4-TRS interaction requires the functional integrity of both Smad4 and TRS.Figure 4Smad4 and Smad3 bind to TRS directly through the MH1 domain.

However, The MH1 domain of Smad3 showed sequence-specific DNA binding activity comparable with that of the MH1 domain of Smad4 (Fig. 4 C), suggesting an inhibitory effect of Smad3 MH2 domain on the DNA binding activity of its MH1 domain. In contrast, the MH1 domain of Smad2, which is also a substrate and mediator of TGF-β and activin receptors (7Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), showed no detectable binding to TRS (Fig. 4 C). Competition EMSA with wild type and mutant TRS revealed that Smad3 had the same specificity of binding to TRS as Smad4 (data not shown). These observations together with previous structural and functional studies (24Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massagué J.

Nature. 1997; 388: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) support the notion that in the absence of TGF-β stimulation, Smad3 exists in an inactive configuration in which the MH1 and MH2 domains mutually inhibit their DNA binding and effector functions, respectively.It has been reported that both Smad3 and Smad4 bind to a synthetic octamer sequence termed SBE (Smad binding element), which mediates strong TGF-β responsiveness (14Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Although the overall sequence of the TRS appears to be quite different from the SBE, the 5′-AGAC-3′ sequence in the TRS is identical to the half-site of the 8-bp palindromic sequence (GTCTAGAC) in SBE. After our manuscript was submitted, Dennler et al. (29Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar) reported the identification of Smad3 and Smad4 binding sequences, termed “CAGA boxes,” in the human PAI-1 promoter. The most distal “CAGA box,” which showed higher affinity for binding to Smad4 and mediated stronger TGF-β induction than the two more proximal elements, partially overlaps with the TRS identified in this report. However, the TRS described here contains no CAGA sequence, since it does not included the 5′-cytosine. Of note, both TRS and the CAGA boxes contain the 4-bp AGAC element that is the half-site of SBE and also exists in the Smad4 binding site in the collagenase promoter in the 3TP lux (13Yingling J.M. Batto M.B. Wong C. Frederick A.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of AGAC sequence in all these Smad binding sites suggests that this element may play an important role in mediating Smad binding and TGF-β induction. Indeed, mutations in AGAC (TRS m1 and TRS m2) in TRS abrogated both Smad3 and Smad4 binding and TGF-β induction. Although the AGAC in the TRS element is absolutely required, TRS mutants in which the AGAC remains intact (TRS m3 and TRS m5) also failed both to mediate TGF-β induction (Fig. 1) and to compete with wild type TRS for Smad3 and Smad4 binding (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Therefore, sequences beside AGAC in TRS also play an important role in both Smad3/4 binding and in mediating transcriptional activation by TGF-β. Further work will be required to determine the exact bases in these TGF-β-responsive sequences with which Smad3 and Smad4 interact and the contribution of sequences outside AGAC to TGF-β induction. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 family of growth factors regulates diverse biological processes including proliferation, differentiation, development, and extracellular matrix production (1Roberts A.B.

Supershift EMSA using anti-Smad3 and Smad4 antibodies revealed the presence of Smad3 and Smad4 in the TGF-β-inducible complex (II) but not in the TGF-β-independent complex (I) (Fig. 2, B and C). EMSA using cell extracts from COS cells transfected with expression vectors for Myc-Smad4 (8Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R.

The Smad4-dependent complex is supershifted by anti-Myc but not by the control anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 3), confirming the existence of Smad4 in the TRS-protein complex. Competition EMSA showed that the binding of Myc-Smad4 to TRS is specifically competed by wild type but not mutant TRS, demonstrating the specificity of the Smad4-TRS interaction (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results indicate that Smad3 and Smad4 are components of the TRS-binding complex.Figure 3Smad4 expressed in COS cells binds to TRS. Cell extracts from COS cells transfected with Myc-tagged Smad4 expression vector or empty vector were used.

EMSA using purified GST fusion proteins containing different regions of Smad4 demonstrated that the DNA binding is mediated by the MH1 domain of Smad4 (Fig. 4 A). A missense mutation (R100T) in the Smad4 MH1 domain, originally identified in a pancreatic carcinoma (23Schutte M. et al.Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2527-2530PubMed Google Scholar), has been reported to disrupt both growth inhibition and transcriptional activation by TGF-β (24Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Arg-100 in Smad4 corresponds to Arg-133 in Smad2 that is also mutated in colon carcinoma (25Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L.-C. Bapat B. Gallinger S. Andrulis I.

Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The R100T mutation completely eliminated TRS binding by Smad4 even when added at 100-fold greater concentration than the wild type protein (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). The wild type and mutant GST-Smad proteins were purified to similar purity (data not shown), and the exact same amount of each protein was used in the EMSA. Competition EMSA was performed to further establish the specificity and functional relevance of the Smad4-TRS interaction. Wild type TRS effectively competed the binding of Smad4 (Fig. 4 B); however, mutations in TRS that abolished its ability to mediate TGF-β responsiveness (Fig. 1) also abolished (m1, m2, m4) or substantially diminished (m3) its ability to compete for binding to Smad4. These results demonstrate that Smad4, either purifiedin vitro or expressed in vivo, binds specifically to the TRS and that the Smad4-TRS interaction requires the functional integrity of both Smad4 and TRS.Figure 4Smad4 and Smad3 bind to TRS directly through the MH1 domain.

However, The MH1 domain of Smad3 showed sequence-specific DNA binding activity comparable with that of the MH1 domain of Smad4 (Fig. 4 C), suggesting an inhibitory effect of Smad3 MH2 domain on the DNA binding activity of its MH1 domain. In contrast, the MH1 domain of Smad2, which is also a substrate and mediator of TGF-β and activin receptors (7Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), showed no detectable binding to TRS (Fig. 4 C). Competition EMSA with wild type and mutant TRS revealed that Smad3 had the same specificity of binding to TRS as Smad4 (data not shown). These observations together with previous structural and functional studies (24Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massagué J.

Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Although the overall sequence of the TRS appears to be quite different from the SBE, the 5′-AGAC-3′ sequence in the TRS is identical to the half-site of the 8-bp palindromic sequence (GTCTAGAC) in SBE. After our manuscript was submitted, Dennler et al. (29Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar) reported the identification of Smad3 and Smad4 binding sequences, termed “CAGA boxes,” in the human PAI-1 promoter. The most distal “CAGA box,” which showed higher affinity for binding to Smad4 and mediated stronger TGF-β induction than the two more proximal elements, partially overlaps with the TRS identified in this report. However, the TRS described here contains no CAGA sequence, since it does not included the 5′-cytosine. Of note, both TRS and the CAGA boxes contain the 4-bp AGAC element that is the half-site of SBE and also exists in the Smad4 binding site in the collagenase promoter in the 3TP lux (13Yingling J.M. Batto M.B. Wong C. Frederick A.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of AGAC sequence in all these Smad binding sites suggests that this element may play an important role in mediating Smad binding and TGF-β induction. Indeed, mutations in AGAC (TRS m1 and TRS m2) in TRS abrogated both Smad3 and Smad4 binding and TGF-β induction. Although the AGAC in the TRS element is absolutely required, TRS mutants in which the AGAC remains intact (TRS m3 and TRS m5) also failed both to mediate TGF-β induction (Fig. 1) and to compete with wild type TRS for Smad3 and Smad4 binding (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Therefore, sequences beside AGAC in TRS also play an important role in both Smad3/4 binding and in mediating transcriptional activation by TGF-β. Further work will be required to determine the exact bases in these TGF-β-responsive sequences with which Smad3 and Smad4 interact and the contribution of sequences outside AGAC to TGF-β induction. Previous analyses of the human PAI-1 promoter have mapped TGF-β-responsive elements to different regions and implicated different sequence-specific transcription factors in mediating TGF-β response in human hepatoma cell lines (20Keeton M.R.

To better understand how the TGF-β signal activates target genes, we first carried out mutational analyses of the PAI-1 promoter. Consistent with the observation of Keeton et al. (20Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.-J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), deletion of sequence between −740 and −700 from the PAI-1 promoter significantly reduced TGF-β induction from 30-fold to less than 4-fold, indicating that this region contains sequences that are required for optimal induction by TGF-β (data not shown). Therefore, this region was further characterized, and it was found that a 12-base pair (bp) sequence from −732 to −721 (AGACAAGGTTGT) is capable of conferring TGF-β responsiveness to a minimal promoter construct, pE1b-luc. A reporter construct containing four copies of this 12-bp TRS was induced more than 4-fold by TGF-β, whereas a construct containing six copies of TRS was induced nearly 40-fold by TGF-β (Fig. 1). In contrast, the same vector containing the E1b TATA box alone or six copies of sequence from −720 to −708 (TGACACAAGAGAG), containing a TRE-like sequence (20Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.-J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is unresponsive to TGF-β (Fig. 1). Point mutations and double or triple base substitutions in the TRS completely abrogated TGF-β responsiveness (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that the 12-bp TRS is both necessary and sufficient for mediating transcriptional responsiveness to TGF-β, thus defining this minimal TRS as a critical target for transcriptional activation by TGF-β. EMSA revealed the formation of two complexes with TRS (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4). Complex II is strongly enhanced by TGF-β, whereas complex I is relatively unchanged. Point mutations in TRS, which resulted in loss of TGF-β responsiveness (Fig. 1), eliminated the formation of both complexes (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–8). These results indicate that cellular proteins bind specifically to the TRS and that the formation of these complexes correlates with transcriptional activation by TGF-β. Since Smad proteins have been identified as mediators of TGF-β signaling (3Derynck R. Feng X.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 4Heldin C.H.

Dermatophyte fungi of the genus Trichophyton colonize keratinized tissues in humans including nails, hair shafts, and the stratum corneum of the skin. Trichophyton tonsurans, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum are common causes worldwide of tinea capitis, athlete's foot, and onychomycosis (infection of the nail beds) (1Aly R. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1994; 31: S21-S25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).

The immune response to antigens derived from Trichophyton is unique in that both immediate hypersensitivity (IH)1 and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test reactions are induced. Studies suggest that the nature of the underlying immune response toTrichophyton antigens is related to the severity of dermatophytosis; IH skin tests are associated with chronic recurrent infections characterized by low-grade inflammatory lesions and the presence of IgE antibodies (Ab) (4Jones H.E.

Characterization of antigens derived fromTrichophyton provides a model system for studying both IgE antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses in humans; elucidation of the amino acid sequences of these antigens is relevant to structural analyses of intrinsic antigenic properties governing diverse immune responses and to the identification of antigenic determinants associated with immediate and delayed type hypersensitivity. Furthermore, elucidation of the biologic function of these unique antigens may define a role in fungal pathogenicity. We previously demonstrated that an 83-kDa T. tonsuransantigen (Tri t 4) elicited IH and DTH skin test reactions in different individuals (27Woodfolk J.A. Slunt J.B. Deuell B. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1695-1701PubMed Google Scholar). IH skin tests were associated with IgG, IgE, and IgG4 Ab specific for Tri t 4, whereas DTH reactions were associated with only low levels of IgG Ab. In addition, short-term T cell lines specific for Tri t 4 had distinct cytokine profiles characteristic of a Th1 and Th2/ThO phenotype that correlated with skin test reactivityin vivo (28Slunt J.B. Taketomi E.A. Woodfolk J.A. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5192-5197PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe the molecular cloning and expression of the Tri t 4 homologue, Tri r 4, produced by T. rubrum and define its limited sequence identity to the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteinases. In addition, we characterize a novel T. rubrum allergen (Tri r 2) that has a high degree of sequence identity to the subtilase enzyme family; this protein exhibits human IgG and IgE Ab binding properties and the ability to induce DTH skin test reactions. Cultures of T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and T. tonsurans were established in 25 ml of Sabouraud dextrose broth, and culture filtrates were screened using an assay for Protein IV as described previously (27Woodfolk J.A. Slunt J.B. Deuell B. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1695-1701PubMed Google Scholar). TheT. rubrum cultures produced the highest concentration of Protein IV and were selected for construction of a cDNA library. Natural Protein IV was previously isolated from T. tonsurans, and this protein is now correctly termed Tri t 4 in keeping with allergen nomenclature. Thus, the homologous protein produced by T. rubrum is Tri r 4. Six grams of T. rubrum cells harvested on day 7 were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and ground with a mortar and pestle pre-cooled at −70 °C. Messenger RNA was isolated from 6 g of culture material using a FastTrack kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A T. rubrumcDNA library was prepared from 10 μg of mRNA in the UniZAP-XR phagemid expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). cDNA clones were identified by screening the library with either a 1:5000 dilution of serum obtained from a mouse immunized with natural Tri t 4 (n-Tri t 4) or a 1:2 dilution of an IgE serum pool from four individuals with high titer IgE antibodies and IH skin test reactions to aTrichophyton extract (29Arruda L.K Vailes L.D. Hayden M.L. Benjamin D.C. Chapman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31196-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Selected cDNA clones were screened against individual sera from 10 subjects with IH skin test reactions to Trichophyton and five individuals with DTH or negative skin test reactions. DNA sequencing was carried out by automated sequencing (ABI Prism 377, Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Sequences obtained were compared with the National Biomedical Research Foundation, Swiss-Prot, and GenBankTMData Banks using FASTA. Sequence alignments were performed using the GCG program. The presence of signal peptides was confirmed using the prediction algorithm developed by Nielsen et al. (30Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). Recombinant Tri r 4 (r-Tri r 4) was expressed in P. pastoris as a hexahistidine-tagged protein using the pPICZαA expression vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA (50 ng) encoding Tri r 4 was used as a template to generate a 2178-bp DNA fragment by polymerase chain reaction. The following primers for polymerase chain reaction were synthesized: 5′-CCGGAATTCTTTACCCCAGAGGACTTC-3′ (sense), containing an EcoRI restriction site; and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCGTCGAAGTAAGAGTGAGC-3′ (antisense), containing anXbaI restriction site. The 2178-bp polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragment was ligated intoEcoRI-XbaI-digested pPICZαA. Escherichia coli strain TOP10F′ was transformed, and plasmid DNA was purified from Zeocin-resistant transformants selected on low salt LB medium containing 25 μg/ml Zeocin. Yeast strain KM71 was transformed by electroporation (Bio-Rad GenePulser; 1500 V, 25 microfarads, 200 S) with 5 μg of DNA linearized by digestion with PmeI. Transformants were selected on yeast extract peptone dextrose agar containing 100 μg/ml Zeocin after incubation at 30 °C for 3 days. A single colony was used to inoculate 10 ml of buffered glycerol complex medium, and cultures were grown at 30 °C in a shaking incubator (300 rpm) until the culture reachedA 600 nm = 2.5. The process was repeated using 10 ml of culture to inoculate 1 liter of medium. After reaching A600 nm = 2.5, cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g for 5 min) and resuspended in 100 ml of buffered methanol complex medium containing 0.5% methanol. Expression of r-Tri r 4 was induced at 30 °C in the presence of methanol for 4 days. The recombinant protein was purified from culture supernatants using immobilized nickel chelate (Probond resin, Invitrogen). Purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with silver staining, and protein yields were measured by the Bradford assay. Proteins expressed in pPICZαA contain an NH2-terminal α factor signal sequence that targets expressed proteins to the secretory pathway and into the culture medium. Proteins also contain carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine and Myc epitope tags. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of r-Tri r 4 by Edman degradation confirmed cleavage of the signal sequence and the presence of the first 22 NH2-terminal residues corresponding to those of n-Tri t 4. Plasmid DNA containingT. rubrum clone 9A (∼1500 bp) was used as a template to generate an 867-bp DNA fragment encoding the carboxyl-terminal 289 amino acids corresponding to the putative mature form of Tri r 2. Primers for polymerase chain reaction incorporated EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites to allow subcloning into the pGEX-4T-3 expression vector and were as follows: 5′-CCGGAATTCGGGCACTAACCTCACC-3′ (sense), containing an EcoRI restriction site; and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTTGCCGCTGCCG-3′ (antisense), containing an XhoI restriction site. The 867-bp polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragment was ligated intoEcoRI-XhoI-digested pGEX-4T-3. Expression of the 29-kDa putative mature form of Tri r 2 as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) was induced in E. coli strain BL21 with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. The recombinant protein (GST-Tri r 2) was purified from cell lysates using glutathione-Sepharose (yield of ∼2–5 mg/liter of culture). Amino acid sequencing of the fusion protein by Edman degradation confirmed the presence of the first 5 NH2-terminal residues of the GST moiety. Purified GST-Tri r 2 was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and purity was analyzed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE for the purpose of skin testing. The recombinant protein was also purified by electroelution from a 12% acrylamide gel for the purpose of radiolabeling (31LeGendre N.M. Mansfield M. Weiss A. Matsudaira P. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-Tri r 2 and Tri r 4 proteins were tested for proteolytic activity using a variety of substrates. Proteinase K (Sigma) was used as a positive control for all assays. Negative controls included reactions containing no putative enzyme. Glutathione S-transferase served as an additional negative control for assays of GST-Tri r 2 enzymatic activity. All assays were performed in duplicate. Substrates tested included azoalbumin, azocasein, azocollagen, and keratin according to methods previously described (32Bajorath J. Saenger W. Pal G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Lambkin I. Hamilton A.J. Hay R.J. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 13: 131-140PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of the sample to be tested was incubated with 0.1 mg of azoalbumin, 2% (w/v) azocasein, 5 mg of azocollagen, or 5 mg of keratin azure in reaction volumes of 1, 0.2, 0.5, and 0.3 ml, respectively. Reactions were terminated after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C (azocasein, azocollagen, and keratin) or after 30 min at 20 °C (azoalbumin). Reaction products were measured spectrophotometrically. One unit of activity was defined as an increase in absorbance of 0.01. Recombinant Tri r 2 was also tested using the anilide substrate succinyl-(Ala)3 -p-nitroanilide (32Bajorath J. Saenger W. Pal G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions contained a final concentration of 10 μg/ml Tri r 2 and substrate concentrations of 0.1–2.0 mmol/liter; assays of 1-ml volume were incubated at 20 °C for 1 h, and the absorbance of liberated nitroaniline was measured spectrophotometrically. IgE and IgG Ab to GST-Tri r 2 were measured using an antigen binding radioimmunoassay according to methods previously described (27Woodfolk J.A. Slunt J.B. Deuell B. Hayden M.L. Platts-Mills T.A.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1695-1701PubMed Google Scholar). Serum samples diluted 1:2 and 1:10 (IgE Ab assay) or 1:12.5 and 1:50 (IgG Ab assay) were incubated with125I-labeled GST-Tri r 2 (∼120,000 cpm added) for 4 h at room temperature. IgE myeloma serum (patient P. S.) diluted 1:300 was used as carrier in the IgE binding assay. Immune complexes were precipitated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of sheep anti-human IgE or 50 μl of sheep anti-human IgG (Binding Site, Inc., San Diego, CA), and precipitates were counted in a γ-counter. Quantitation of IgG Ab was carried out using a control curve constructed with pooled sera from patients K. M., J. C., and H. W., assigned to contain 2000 units/ml IgG antibodies. IgE Ab measurements are expressed as counts bound per min. Specificity of antibody binding to Tri r 2 was assessed by comparing values obtained for sera pre-absorbed with GST (5 mg of GST/ml of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose) and non-absorbed sera. Sera were obtained from 73 subjects previously skin-tested with 0.03 ml of Hollister-StierTrichophyton mixture containing T. tonsurans, T. rubrum, and T. mentagrophytes species (1:200, w/v). Intradermal skin testing was done with 0.03 ml of purified GST-Tri r 2 at 1 and 10 μg/ml diluted in 0.05% human serum albumin in phenol/saline solution. Prick testing was carried out prior to intradermal testing using a 10-fold higher concentration of protein. Test sites were examined at 20 min after injection and at 24 and 48 h. Positive delayed reactions were defined as erythema of ≥5-mm diameter at 24 h. Subjects were skin-tested with purified GST as a negative control. Skin testing of human subjects using GST-Tri r 2 was approved by the University of Virginia Human Investigation Committee. Screening a T. rubrumcDNA library with a human serum pool obtained from five individuals with high titer IgE Ab to n-Tri t 4 failed to identify positive plaques. However, screening the library with polyclonal serum obtained from a mouse immunized with n-Tri t 4 resulted in identification of three clones containing insert sizes of ∼1100 bp (clonetr2), 1600 bp (clone tr1), and 2300 bp (clonetr3). Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed that all clones encoded the same protein. Clone tr3 contained an open reading frame of 2178 nucleotides encoding a 726-amino acid protein (Fig. 1). An estimated molecular mass of 78,193 Da (pK = 2.2) without the signal peptide sequence was consistent with a non-glycosylated form of n-Tri t 4. Four potential sites of N-linked glycosylation were identified, and the presence of a signal sequence with a predicted site of cleavage between Ala19 and Phe20 was determined. Amino acid sequences of the amino terminus and six enzymatically generated internal peptides of n-Tri t 4 (comprising 108 residues) aligned with the deduced amino acid sequence of clone tr3. This confirmed that T. rubrum clone tr3 encoded a protein with high amino acid sequence homology to n-Tri t 4, and we have designated this recombinant protein Tri r 4. Amino acid sequence similarity searches identified homology between r-Tri r 4 and the prolyl oligopeptidase (S9) family of serine proteinases. These enzymes contain the distinctive Ser-Asp-His arrangement of catalytic triad residues in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the molecule. A short region spanning ∼250 residues was identified within r-Tri r 4 that contained sequence similarity to prolyl oligopeptidases derived from other eukaryotic sources (20–25% identity, 231–282-amino acid overlap). A Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly motif comprising the nucleophile serine at position 539 was present within this region. The highest sequence similarity was between r-Tri r 4 and human acylaminoacyl peptidase (25.6% identity and 57% similarity in a 242-amino acid overlap) (Fig. 2). Additional homologues included Saccharomyces dipeptidyl aminopeptidases B and C and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV-like proteins (DPP6) derived from several mammalian species. Recombinant Tri r 4 was expressed in P. pastoris using the pPICZαA vector system. SDS-PAGE analysis at 24 h after induction of protein expression revealed the presence of an 85-kDa band in all recombinants selected consistent with a glycosylated form of r-Tri r 4 containing carboxyl-terminal Myc epitope and hexahistidine tags (Fig. 3 A). The recombinant protein was purified by affinity purification from culture supernatants harvested on day 4, resulting in a yield of ∼200 mg/liter of culture. The pure protein migrated as a single 85-kDa band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 B). Since screening theT. rubrum cDNA library with an initial human serum pool (Pool 1) failed to identify positive plaques, a second pool was established (Pool 2) in order to screen for additional putativeT. rubrum allergens. Sera were obtained from four individuals with high IgE antibody titers and IH skin test reactions to a Trichophyton extract. All subjects had chronic dermatophytosis, whereas three had asthma and positive bronchial provocation to Trichophyton. Five positive clones were identified with insert sizes of ∼900 bp (clone tr6D), 1000 bp (clone tr6C), 1200 bp (clone tr6B), 1300 bp (clone tr6A), and 1500 bp (clone tr9A). Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed that all five clones encoded the same protein and that this protein was unrelated to Tri r 4. A representative clone (tr6B) was screened with sera obtained from individuals with different skin test reactivity toTrichophyton. Eight of 10 subjects with IH skin test reactions displayed IgE antibody binding to this clone, whereas sera from DTH and negative skin test subjects yielded no positive responders (Fig. 4). Clone 9A contained an open reading frame encoding 412 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 42,632 Da and a pK value of 1.9 (Fig. 5). The first 20 NH2-terminal residues contained the conserved features of a signal peptide, and four potential sites of N-linked glycosylation were identified.Figure 5Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of T. rubrum cDNA clone 9A encoding Tri r 2. The NH2-terminal amino acid residues (positions 1–20) contain the conserved features of a signal peptide.Double-underlined regions represent conserved amino acid motifs flanking catalytic triad residues (•) characteristic of the subtilase family of serine proteinases.

The stop codon TAA (*) is shown, and a polyadenylation signal sequence (ATAAA) in the 3′-noncoding region isunderlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequence similarity searches showed a significant homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of clone 9A and serine proteinases of the subtilase family (S8) derived from other fungal species (Fig. 6). Conserved amino acid motifs were identified flanking aspartic acid, histidine, and serine residues, which form the catalytic triad characteristic of this enzyme family. Over 70 subtilases are currently known, belonging to four subfamilies. The deduced amino acid sequence of clone 9A contained all of the conserved residues characteristic of the class D subfamily, which consists of enzymes found only in yeast, fungi, and Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 6). The highest degree of amino acid sequence identity was between Tri r 2 and proteinase T produced by the thermophilic fungus Tritirachium album (58.2% identity in a 304-amino acid overlap). Other enzymes with striking homologies included proteinases derived from the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus (41.3% identity), the insect-colonizing fungusMetarhizium anisopliae (42.3%), and the yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe (41%) (Fig. 6). Sequence alignments identified the presence of a putative pro-region in Tri r 2 (residues 21–123) with a predicted cleavage site between asparagine and glycine residues (positions 123 and 124, respectively) generating a putative mature product (positions 124–412) with an estimated molecular mass of 29,171 Da (pK = 1.9) (Fig. 5). The putative mature form of Tri r 2 was produced in E. coli using the pGEX-4T-3 vector. The resulting GST fusion protein purified from bacterial lysates by glutathione affinity chromatography migrated as a single 57-kDa band on SDS-PAGE, consistent with the presence of a GST moiety fused to the 29-kDa putative mature form of Tri r 2. Specific IgE Ab were measured in 73 sera: the prevalence of IgE Ab was significantly higher among subjects with IH skin test reactions (43%) compared with those with DTH or negative skin test reactions (12%) (p < 0.01) (Fig. 7 A). It has been established that GST exhibits IgE Ab binding properties (34Arruda L.K. Vailes L.D. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Hayden M.L. Chapman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20907-20912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); however, absorption of sera with GST did not reduce the prevalence of IgE Ab binding to Tri r 2. The prevalence of IgG Ab was relatively high in all skin test groups. However, mean levels of IgG Ab were significantly higher in subjects with immediate reactions compared with those with delayed or negative skin test reactions (p < 0.01) (Fig. 7 B). Recombinant 125I-GST-Tri r 2 showed strong reactivity with IgG Ab (up to 46,000 cpm bound) and IgE Ab (up to 10,500 cpm bound), demonstrating that the putative mature form of Tri r 2 retained B cell epitopes. Intradermal skin testing was used to evaluate the reactivity of recombinant Tri r 2 in vivo. Five of nine individuals with delayed reactions to theTrichophyton mixture showed a positive delayed type hypersensitivity reaction maximal at 24 h; four of these subjects are shown in Table I.Table ISkin test responses and serum antibodies to a GST fusion protein containing the putative mature form of Tri r 2PatientSkin test to Trichophytonmixture1-aValues in parentheses represent diameter of induration (mm) on intradermal testing at 24 h.

Furthermore, this protein exhibited no activity against the anilide substrate succinyl-(Ala)3 -p-nitroanilide.

https://openalex.org/W2073322512,"A novel putative member of the human UDP-galactose:β-N-acetylglucosamine β1,4-galactosyltransferase family, designated β4Gal-T4, was identified by BLAST analysis of expressed sequence tags. The sequence of β4Gal-T4 encoded a type II membrane protein with significant sequence similarity to other β1,4-galactosyltransferases. Expression of the full coding sequence and a secreted form of β4Gal-T4 in insect cells showed that the gene product had β1,4-galactosyltransferase activity. Analysis of the substrate specificity of the secreted form revealed that the enzyme catalyzed glycosylation of glycolipids with terminal β-GlcNAc; however, in contrast to β4Gal-T1, -T2, and -T3, this enzyme did not transfer galactose to asialo-agalacto-fetuin, asialo-agalacto-transferrin, or ovalbumin. The catalytic activity of β4Gal-T4 with monosaccharide acceptor substrates,N-acetylglucosamine as well as glucose, was markedly activated in the presence of α-lactalbumin. The genomic organization of the coding region of β4Gal-T4 was contained in six exons. All intron/exon boundaries were similarly positioned in β4Gal-T1, -T2, and -T3. β4Gal-T4 represents a new member of the β4-galactosyltransferase family.

So far, all genes except one, localized at chromosome 3q13.3 and designated β4Gal-T4, have been expressed and shown to represent β4-galactosyltransferases. β4Gal-T4 is the subject of this report.The greater β4Gal-T gene family may include members with both distinct and conserved donor and/or acceptor substrate specificities. For example, a snail gene, previously identified by hybridization to a β4Gal-T1 probe, has acceptor substrate specificity similar to β4Gal-T1, but different donor substrate specificity as it is a β4GlcNAc-transferase (13Bakker H. Agterberg M. Van Tetering A. Koeleman C.A. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Die I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30326-30333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This β4GlcNAc-transferase is not responsive to α-lactalbumin modulation (14Bakker H. Schoenmakers P.S. Koeleman C.A. Joziasse D.H. Van Die I. Van den Eijnden D.H. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, a snail β4GalNAc-transferase activity with acceptor substrate specificity similar to β4Gal-T1 exhibits sensitivity to α-lactalbumin modulation of the acceptor specificity (15Neeleman A.P. Van den Eijnden D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10111-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The donor substrate specificity of β4Gal-T1 is modulated by α-lactalbumin to include UDP-GalNAc, and the donor substrate specificity of the snail β4GalNAc-transferase activity is modulated to include UDP-Gal, albeit at much less efficiencies (15Neeleman A.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18447-18451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Given the similarities in donor substrate specificities and α-lactalbumin modulation, it is likely that the snail β1,4GalNAc-transferase will be homologous to the mammalian β4Gal-T gene family (15Neeleman A.P.

Trans. 1997; 25: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-R structure exists in man, but is mainly associated withN-linked glycans found on glycoprotein hormones (18Smith P.L. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A putative glycoprotein β4GalNAc-transferase with selective activity for N-glycans associated with a specific peptide sequence has been characterized (19Mengeling B.J. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); however, this enzyme may be unrelated to the β4Gal-T gene family.In the present study, we used human EST sequence information to identify and clone a novel member of the β4Gal-T gene family, designated β4Gal-T4. β4Gal-T4 is an active UDP-Gal:βGlcNAc β1,4Gal-transferase with specificity for glycolipid substrates; however, it does not catalyze glycosylation of several glycoprotein acceptors, which are good substrates for other β4Gal-transferases. β4Gal-T4 exhibits α-lactalbumin modulation that is similar to a previously characterized snail β1,4GalNAc-transferase activity (15Neeleman A.P. Van den Eijnden D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10111-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The data demonstrate that members of the β4Gal-T gene family have distinct functions in galactosylation of different glycoconjugates, and suggest that β4Gal-T4 mainly plays a role in glycolipid biosynthesis.DISCUSSIONThe human β4Gal-transferase gene family includes at least six members, which are involved in the synthesis of theN-acetyllactosamine disaccharide in oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates (2Almeida R.

This large number of enzymes covering a single glycosidic linkage suggests either a high degree of redundancy in functions, or it may suggest that the enzymes have different functions. The high degree of divergence in primary sequence of the enzymes, studies of the acceptor substrate specificities of recombinant β4Gal-Ts (2Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), clearly point to different functional roles for each enzyme. Hence, the regulation of β1–4-galactosylation is more complex than previously recognized. Studies of the kinetic properties and the expression patterns of the individual enzymes may provide insight into their roles in synthesis of different types of glycoconjugates or in regulation of elongation and branching of poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures.The sixth human member of the β4Gal-transferase family, β4Gal-T4, characterized in the study presented here, was found to exhibit unique kinetic properties. A dendrogram analysis (ClustalW) of the six human β4Gal-transferases indicates that the following pairs of enzymes, β4Gal-T1 and -T2, β4Gal-T3 and -T4, and β4Gal-T5 and -T6, are especially related (10Lo N. Shaper J.H. Pevsner J. Shaper N.L. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Since the first four identified human β4Gal-transferases, β4Gal-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T5, have similar donor and acceptor substrate specificities, it was expected that β4Gal-T4 also would have similar activity. β4Gal-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T4 all utilize βGlcNAc-terminating glycolipid acceptors (Lc3Cer, nLc5Cer) (2Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31979-31992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Table III). β4Gal-T4 resembled its closer homologue β4Gal-T3 in showing strong preference for the shorter glycolipid substrate compared with nLc5Cer (Table III) (2Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

This is in contrast to the bovine milk β4Gal-T, which efficiently utilized both glycolipid substrates (2Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31979-31992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). No natural glycoconjugate acceptor for β4Gal-T5 has been reported (6Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Die I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but its close homologue, β4Gal-T6, transfers Gal to glucosylceramide (9Nomura T. Takizawa M. Aoki J. Arai H. Inoue K. Wakisaka E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13570-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).An important finding was that the β4Gal-transferases showed different catalytic activities with glycoprotein acceptors. β4Gal-T1, -T2, and -T3 catalyzed transfer to asialo-agalacto-fetuin, asialo-agalacto-transferrin, and ovalbumin with varying efficiency, whereas β4Gal-T4 was inactive with these substrates (Table II). β4Gal-T5 was also reported to be inactive with asialo-agalacto-transferrin (6Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Die I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The panel of glycoprotein substrates tested in the present study does not represent a complete set of possible N-linked glycan acceptor sequences, and the actual acceptor sequences for β4Gal-T1, -T2, and -T3 were not determined in the present study. Ovalbumin contains a single N-glycan with considerable heterogeneity, and mainly one potential acceptor sequence, GlcNAcβ1–2Manα (45Kobata A. Ginsburg V. Robbins P.W. Biology of Carbohydrates. Wiley-Interscience, New York1984: 87-161Google Scholar). Transferrin has two complex biantennaryN-linked glycans with GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3Man and GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6Man acceptor sites (46Beyer T.A. Rearick J.I. Paulson J.C. Prieels J.P. Sadler J.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12531-12534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fetuin contains three complex N-glycans of the biantennary form or of the 2,4-branched triantennary type (47Yet M.G. Chin C.C. Wold F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 111-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Do K.Y. Fregien N. Pierce M. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23456-23464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although no acceptor glycoprotein for β4Gal-T4 was identified, it is possible that this enzyme does catalyze transfer of galactose to glycoproteins since disaccharides and a pentasaccharide representing complexN-glycans served as a substrate (Table I). However, the activities with these structures were less than with monosaccharide derivatives, suggesting that indeed these oligosaccharides do not represent the glycoconjugate substrates. Fetuin also contains threeO-glycans, of which some are of the complex type (49Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5704-5717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although β4Gal-T4 catalyzed glycosylation of the disaccharide structure GlcNAcβ1–3GalNAcα1-pNP (theO-linked core 3 structure), the enzyme apparently did not work with the O-linked acceptors of asialo-agalacto-fetuin (Tables I and II). If β4Gal-T4 functions with glycoprotein acceptors, it may be with more complex structures. Preliminary studies withO-GlcNAc glycopeptides indicate that most enzymes can catalyze transfer to this type of protein glycosylation (50Torres C.R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but β4Gal-T4 showed the poorest activity. 3T. Schwientek, G. Arsequell, and H. Clausen, unpublished observation. Collectively, it appears likely that the main function of β4Gal-T4 is in the biosynthesis of neolactoseries glycosphingolipids.The catalytic efficiency of β4Gal-T4 with simple sugars and sugar derivatives was poor compared with β4Gal-T1, -T2, and -T3 (Tables Iand II). At the concentrations tested, only β4Gal-T4 did not show substrate inhibition (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the activity of β4Gal-T4 with GlcNAc was activated by α-lactalbumin to levels comparable to the activities with GlcNAc of other β4Gal-Ts in the absence of α-lactalbumin (Fig. 6). A similar, although weaker, effect was previously found for the milk β4Gal-T (T1) activity with concentrations of GlcNAc acceptor below K m (7Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar,35Powell J.T. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3653-3663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bell J.E. Beyer T.A.

At high GlcNAc acceptor concentrations, both β4Gal-T1 and -T2 are strongly inhibited by α-lactalbumin, and this was suggested to reflect enhanced acceptor substrate accessibility (Fig. 7) (2Almeida R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5106-5114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Correspondingly, interaction of α-lactalbumin with β4Gal-T1 modulates the acceptor specificity from GlcNAc to Glc, thus forming the basis for lactose synthesis in mammary glands (7Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 52Brodbeck U. Denton W.L. Tanahashi N. Ebner K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1391-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β4Gal-T2 is also efficiently induced to catalyze synthesis of lactose in the presence of α-lactalbumin (2Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

In contrast, β4Gal-T3 and β4Gal-T5 are largely insensitive to α-lactalbumin modulation, although weak inhibition of N-acetyllactosamine synthesis was observed (2Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

In contrast to the effect of α-lactalbumin on β4Gal-T1 activity toward monosaccharide acceptors, α-lactalbumin acts as a competitive inhibitor of β4Gal-T1 activity with extended acceptor substrates (e.g.β-d-GlcNAc-1-benzyl orN,N′-diacetylchitobiose; see Refs. 34Schanbacher F.L.

Surprisingly, α-lactalbumin did not show a similar inhibitory effect on the activity of β4Gal-T4 with β-d-GlcNAc-1-benzyl at any concentration tested (Fig. 7 B). The obtained data therefore suggest that α-lactalbumin interacts differently with β4Gal-T1 and β4Gal-T4.β4Gal-T1 is strongly expressed in lactating mammary glands (41Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14348-14359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been reported that β4Gal-T5 is weakly expressed as well (8Sato T. Aoki N. Matsuda T. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, Lo et al. (10Lo N. Shaper J.H. Pevsner J. Shaper N.L. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) found that, of the six members of the family identified so far, only β4Gal-T1 is expressed in murine lactating glands. β4Gal-T2 is unlikely to be expressed in mammary glands since mice deficient in β4Gal-T1 do not produce lactose in milk (43Lu Q. Hasty P. Shur B.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 44Asano M. Furukawa K. Kido M. Matsumoto S. Umesaki Y. Kochibe N. Iwakura Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1850-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the interaction of β4Gal-T4 with α-lactalbumin may be weaker or different than β4Gal-T1, since affinity chromatography with α-lactalbumin-Sepharose did not bind β4Gal-T4 under the same conditions under which β4Gal-T1 binds (53Bendiak B. Ward L.D. Simpson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (data not shown).The distinct response of β4Gal-T4 to α-lactalbumin resembles the response reported for a snail UDP-GalNAc:βGlcNAc β1–4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity (15Neeleman A.P. Van den Eijnden D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10111-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The β4GalNAc-transferase activity with GlcNAc-concentrations belowK m was activated nearly 3-fold in the presence of α-lactalbumin, and the activity with Glc was increased 20-fold (12 mg/ml). For β4Gal-T1 and -T2 the relative lactose synthase activity inducible by α-lactalbumin is over 2-fold higher as compared withN-acetyllactosamine synthase activity without (2Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol.

A comparable analysis of human β4Gal-T4 and snail β4GalNAc-transferase activity also shows approximately 2-fold higher rates; however, it should be noted that GlcNAc is a poor substrate for these enzymes without α-lactalbumin (Table I) (15Neeleman A.P.

Wild-type P2Y2 receptors and a series of five C-terminal truncation mutants of the receptor were epitope-tagged and stably expressed in 1321N1 cells. These constructs were used to assess the importance of the intracellular C terminus on 1) UTP-stimulated increases in intracellular calcium concentration, 2) homologous desensitization of the receptor, and 3) agonist-induced decreases in cell-surface density (receptor sequestration) of epitope-tagged receptors using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The potency and efficacy of UTP were similar for the wild-type and all mutant P2Y2 receptors. Truncation of 18 or more amino acids from the C terminus increased by ∼30-fold the concentration of UTP necessary to desensitize the receptor. Both the rate and magnitude of UTP-induced receptor sequestration were decreased with progressively larger truncations of the C terminus. Furthermore, the recovery from sequestration was slower for the most extensively truncated receptor. Complete desensitization was obtained with >50% of the original receptor complement remaining on the cell surface. Protein kinase C activation, which desensitizes the P2Y2 receptor, had no effect on sequestration, consistent with the ideas that desensitization and sequestration are discrete events and that agonist occupancy is required for receptor sequestration.

Responses to extracellular nucleotides are mediated by P2 receptors that belong to two receptor superfamilies: P2Y G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 and P2X ligand-gated ion channels. Multiple P2Y subtypes have been classified pharmacologically and molecularly and are predominantly linked to activation of phospholipase C and increased levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, leading to elevations in the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (1Lustig K.D.

The P2Y2 nucleotide receptor subtype (formerly the P2U receptor) is distinguished pharmacologically from the other known mammalian P2Y receptor subtypes by the equal potency and efficacy of the naturally occurring agonists ATP and UTP. Activation of P2Y2 receptors present in airway epithelium increases Cl− secretion through Ca2+-dependent and outwardly rectifying Cl− channels (5Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C348-C356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that P2Y2receptor activation by UTP in airway epithelia of cystic fibrosis patients can increase Cl− secretion, thereby effectively bypassing the defective cAMP-dependent Cl−transport (6Knowles M.R. Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Like other members of the GPCR superfamily, P2Y2 receptors undergo agonist-induced desensitization (7Wilkinson G.F. Purkiss J.R. Boarder M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 731-736PubMed Google Scholar), but little is known about the mechanisms involved in desensitization of the P2Y2 receptor. It seems likely that a fuller understanding of desensitization and the signaling pathways that affect the P2Y2 receptor may lead to improved therapies targeted to this receptor. Desensitization of GPCRs is a complex process involving phosphorylation of the receptors by multiple protein kinases, including G protein-coupled receptor kinases, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and PKC. The mechanisms of GPCR desensitization have been studied most extensively with the β2-adrenergic receptor (reviewed in Ref. 8Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of β2-adrenergic receptors by agonist results in G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail (9Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The subsequent agonist-induced increase of cyclic AMP can result in the phosphorylation of additional residues within the β2-adrenergic receptor by protein kinase A. Phosphorylation of β2-adrenergic receptors leads to desensitization and sequestration of the receptors from the cell surface, where they can no longer bind hydrophilic ligands and apparently undergo dephosphorylation prior to recycling to the cell membrane (10Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol.

Prolonged exposure to agonist results in down-regulation of the receptor, which is a decrease in receptor number that requires new protein expression to reestablish receptor levels. We investigated the role of the serine- and threonine-rich C terminus of the P2Y2 receptor in agonist-induced receptor desensitization and sequestration. The C terminus of the P2Y2 receptor contains two consensus phosphorylation sites for PKC (another site is present in the third intracellular loop) and possible sites for G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation. To determine the role of the C terminus in receptor desensitization and sequestration, truncation mutants of a P2Y2 receptor cDNA encoding an epitope-tagged protein were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The truncated receptor cDNAs were expressed in a clonal human 1321N1 astrocytoma cell line devoid of P2Y nucleotide receptors. UTP-induced desensitization was compared in cells expressing mutant or wild-type P2Y2 receptors. Cell-surface receptor density and agonist-induced sequestration in 1321N1 cells were assessed by immunofluorescence detection of the epitope-tagged receptors. Wild-type murine P2Y2 receptor cDNA was subcloned into the retroviral vector pLXSN at the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the multiple cloning site. The open reading frame of the wild-type P2Y2 receptor cDNA was modified to incorporate, at the amino terminus of the expressed protein, the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) from influenza virus using PCR. The forward and reverse HA primers were 5′-gatcgtgaattctgatgtatccatatgatgttccagattatgctgcagcagacctggaaccctgg-3′ and 5′-gatcgtggatcccctgactgaggtgctatagccg-3′, respectively. The PCR solution contained primers (0.7 μm each), 10 μl of 10× Vent polymerase buffer (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), 100 ng of template DNA, 2.5 units of Vent (exo−) polymerase, 0.25 units of Vent (exo+) polymerase, and 20 μl of dNTP mixture (0.2 mm dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP) in a final volume of 100 μl. The PCR parameters were as follows: 96 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min for 25 cycles. The PCR conditions were identical for creation of the five truncation mutants. In each case, the HA epitope was inserted using the forward HA primer and the following reverse primers: 5′-tgctagggatcccgctactatgtccgtcttgagtcgtcact-3′ (truncation mutant 1), 5′-tgctagggatcccgtcatcagtcgtcactactgactgacaaatc-3′ (truncation mutant 2), 5′-tgctagggatcccgctactaacttccagctggtgtggactc-3′ (truncation mutant 3), 5′-tgctagggatcccgtcatcacaaatctttcctcacagttctgttag-3′ (truncation mutant 4), and 5′-gcatcggatcctcatcagttaggcctgtgcaggccc-3′ (truncation mutant 5). After verification of the PCR amplification by agarose gel electrophoresis, the products were purified using a PCR Wizard kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The purified PCR products and pLXSN DNA were digested overnight with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated together, followed by transformation of competentEscherichia coli and identification of positive clones (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All mutant DNAs were sequenced on both strands to ensure that mutagenesis had occurred as predicted, using an ABI Prism automated sequencing apparatus (Perkin-Elmer) and fluorescence dideoxynucleotide technology. Human 1321N1 cells were transfected with HA-tagged murine P2Y2 receptor cDNA (P2Y2-1321N1 cells), using the pLXSN retroviral vector, as described previously (15Nguyen T. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Marchese A. Heng H.H.Q. Garrad R.C. George S.R. Turner J.T. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30845-30848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The P2Y2-1321N1 cells were grown to a density of ∼5 × 106 cells/75-cm2flask in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml Geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The day prior to use of the cells, the growth medium was replaced with G418-free medium. Changes in [Ca2+]i were detected by dual-excitation spectrofluorometric analysis of P2Y2-1321N1 cell suspensions loaded with fura-2 as described previously (16Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J.

Ther. 1990; 253: 1049-1056PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were assayed in 10 mm Hepes-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2 unless indicated otherwise. Desensitization experiments were performed by incubating P2Y2-1321N1 cell suspensions with varying concentrations of UTP for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer. The EC50 value of UTP, determined during the concentration-response experiments (see Fig. 3), was used to re-challenge the cells. Concentration-response data were analyzed with the Prism curve fitting program (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA). P2Y2-1321N1 cells, grown to 80% confluency in 35-mm2 dishes, were incubated with UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma) for the times and at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Control cells were incubated without UTP (to allow an estimation of the total cell-surface complement of P2Y2receptors) for 180 min. The P2Y2-1321N1 cells were washed with 2 ml of ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking in 1 ml of Hepes-buffered saline containing 10 μg of anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) that was affinity-purified as follows. The antibody was added to a HiTrap protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and eluted with 1-ml fractions of 100 mm glycine (pH 2.75). The eluted fractions were immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.5), dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stored for use at a protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml as estimated by a modification (18Smith P.K.

Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells incubated with antibody 12CA5 were washed with 2 ml of Dulbecco's PBS and incubated in 1 ml of Dulbecco's PBS containing 10 μl of Fc-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) in the dark at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 1 h. Control cells were incubated with primary or secondary antibody alone to detect nonspecific fluorescence. The P2Y2-1321N1 cells were washed with 2 ml of Dulbecco's PBS and detached in 2 ml of Hepes-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm EDTA. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of 1% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS and incubated in the dark at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and analyzed on an EPICS 753 flow cytometer (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL) with a 5-watt argon laser tuned at 488 nm using 150-milliwatt output. The instrument was optically aligned using DNA-Check fluorospheres (Coulter Corp.) with the coefficients of variation ≤2%. For each analysis, 10,000 cells were collected using a dual-parameter histogram of forward angle light scatter versus log 90° light scatter to gate out debris. Integral green fluorescence emission (525 band path filter) of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled cells was displayed as a single-parameter histogram on a three-decade log scale. Data analysis was performed using EASY2 software (Coulter Corp.). Fluorescence intensity was used as a measure of differences in receptor density on the cell surface for the various receptor constructs. The computer cursor was set at a point representing half the peak width at half the peak height, and the channel number of this position was noted as the fluorescence intensity of the histogram. Fluorescence intensity was measured after logarithmic amplification with the use of a three-decade log scale, but illustrated on a linear scale of 253 channels or 85.33 units/decade. Fluorescence intensity (FI) was converted to linear arbitrary units (LAU) using the following formula: LAU = 10(FI/85.33). LAU was corrected for fluorescence due to secondary antibody alone. Cells expressing wild-type or mutant P2Y2 receptors that were not incubated with UTP but were incubated with antibody 12CA5 and secondary antibody were considered to have the maximum number of receptor molecules on the cell surface. Cells expressing P2Y2 receptors were diluted from 1:2 to 1:8 with nontransfected 1321N1 cells, and the amount of fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was measured in a Spex dual-excitation/emission spectrofluorometer using 488 and 525 nm for the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Determinations of total protein/ml of cells were made using a modification (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J.

Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A standard curve of fluorescence was constructed with HEK-293 cells heterologously expressing N-terminally HA-tagged β2-adrenergic receptors (B max = 500 fmol/mg of total cell protein (20von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) diluted with nontransfected HEK-293 cells. Five cDNAs encoding P2Y2 receptors with different length C-terminal truncations (Fig. 1) were constructed by PCR and expressed in 1321N1 cells to determine the role of the C terminus in agonist-induced desensitization of receptor-mediated calcium mobilization and receptor sequestration. The most extensively truncated receptor (truncation mutant 5) lacks two of three protein kinase C consensus phosphorylation sites and potential sites of phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase present in the intracellular domains of the wild-type P2Y2receptor. In the absence of an established method to detect P2Y2 receptors on the cell surface, all receptor constructs were N-terminally tagged with an epitope of the HA antigen from influenza virus. The fluorescence intensities of cells expressing the epitope-tagged P2Y2 receptor constructs were determined by flow cytometry, and the resulting scans were superimposed (Fig. 2). These data indicate similar fluorescence intensities for each receptor, with truncation mutant 3 and wild-type receptors representing the high and low values, respectively, of the range of receptor expression. Thus, the expression of the six receptor constructs was approximately the same, with a maximal 2-fold difference in receptor density (Table I). The number of HA-tagged wild-type P2Y2 receptors in 1321N1 cells was estimated by comparison with the fluorescence intensity due to HA-tagged β2-adrenergic receptors (500 fmol/mg of total protein) in HEK-293 cells (20von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β2-adrenergic receptor density was determined to be 32,667 ± 6692 receptors/cell compared with 22,767 ± 9753 receptors/cell for the wild-type P2Y2receptor.Table IEC50/IC50 values of agonist-induced activation and desensitization of [Ca2+]i, together with receptor expression and estimated t½ values and maximum levels of receptor sequestrationRecombinant P2Y2 receptorsConcentration-response EC50 of UTP (activation)Concentration-response IC50 of UTP (desensitization)Normalized receptor expression (wild-type = 1)Estimated t½ values of sequestrationMaximal receptor sequestration after 180 minμmmin%Wild-type0.25 ± 0.030.43 ± 0.11.00 ± 0.10<590 ± 1Truncation 10.47 ± 0.071.23 ± 0.81.07 ± 0.155–1090 ± 1Truncation 20.61 ± 0.233.37 ± 1.81.95 ± 0.184580 ± 1Truncation 30.05 ± 0.017.78 ± 4.82.00 ± 0.156080 ± 2Truncation 40.10 ± 0.0212.3 ± 3.31.09 ± 0.1715050 ± 2Truncation 50.18 ± 0.049.75 ± 5.11.72 ± 0.3612067 ± 14Concentration responses (EC50 and IC50) were determined from the data collected in Fig. 3 (A–F).

Open table in a new tab Concentration responses (EC50 and IC50) were determined from the data collected in Fig. 3 (A–F). Normalized receptor expression levels were calculated by determining the ALI (n = 3) for each receptor construct and comparing each value to the wild-type receptor, which was regarded as 1. Estimated t½ values of sequestration were from Fig. 4 (A–F). Maximal receptor sequestration (the percentage of receptor complement removed from the cell surface) was determined from the data used to construct Fig. 4 (A–F). As shown in Fig. 3 (A–F), wild-type and truncated P2Y2 receptors had similar concentration-effect curves for UTP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. The similarity of the EC50and maximal response values with UTP for the six P2Y2receptor constructs (Fig. 3 and Table I) indicates that the truncations had no marked effect on receptor activation and signaling when the various constructs were expressed at approximately the same density. The truncated receptors exhibited rapid and transient increases in [Ca2+]i in response to UTP, followed by a return to base-line levels within 3 min (data not shown), similar to the wild-type receptor. The desensitization of the calcium response to UTP was determined for each receptor following a 5-min preincubation with the indicated concentration of UTP (Fig. 3). Progressive truncations of the C terminus increased the IC50 values for UTP-induced desensitization to a maximum of 25-fold with truncation mutant 4 (Table I). Fig. 4 shows that >80% of the wild-type receptors were sequestered within 10 min. Thet½, the time at which 50% of the cell-surface receptor complement is sequestered, was <5 min. Progressive truncations of the C terminus of the P2Y2 receptor increased the t½ for sequestration. For the most truncated forms of the receptor (truncation mutants 4 and 5), thet½ values were ∼25-fold greater, and at least 35% of the receptors remained on the cell surface after 180 min. UTP concentration-effect curves show that 50% of the wild-type receptors were sequestered after a 10-min incubation with ∼6 μmUTP, whereas sequestration of 50% of the truncation mutant 5 receptors required a 120-min incubation with 1 mm UTP (Fig. 5). Hydrolysis of UTP by 1321N1 cells was determined by HPLC analysis to be negligible, with 96% of the UTP remaining after 3-h incubation (data not shown). The original UTP stock solution contained a similar percentage of UTP, with 4% contamination with UDP. We were thus unable to detect any significant hydrolysis of UTP under these experimental conditions, unlike Lazarowski et al. (21Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20402-20407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), who demonstrated significant ecto-apyrase activity in 1321N1 cells. It is possible that, during our experiments, too much UTP and too few 1321N1 cells were present to demonstrate significant hydrolysis of nucleotide.Figure 5Concentration-dependent effect of UTP on sequestration of recombinant P2Y2 receptors. A, 1321N1 cells expressing the wild-type P2Y2receptor were incubated with the indicated concentrations of UTP for 10 min, and receptor density on the cell surface was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, 1321N1 cells expressing truncation mutant 5 were incubated with the indicated concentrations of UTP for 120 min, and receptor sequestration was determined as described for A. The values shown are the mean ± S.E. of data from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reversibility of sequestration of the wild-type P2Y2receptor was determined after preincubating cells for 10 min with 1 mm UTP. Following incubation of the cells for various times in the absence of agonist, cell-surface receptor expression was determined. As shown in Fig. 6, recovery was time-dependent and nearly complete (∼90%) after 240 min. Half of the receptor complement returned to the cell surface in ∼60 min. Fig. 7 illustrates the relationship between agonist-induced desensitization and receptor sequestration for the wild-type and truncation mutant 5 receptors. It is apparent for both receptors that 50% of the cell-surface receptor complement was still present when the UTP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was desensitized. Furthermore, the wild-type and truncation mutant 5 P2Y2 receptors had nearly all of the receptor complement on the cell surface when 50% of the UTP-induced calcium response was desensitized. The effects of the protein kinase C activator PMA on desensitization of UTP-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i were examined in cells expressing the wild-type and truncation mutant 5 P2Y2 receptors. Fig. 8 shows that the wild-type and truncation mutant 5 receptors have similar IC50 values (35 ± 17 and 62 ± 35 nm, respectively) for PMA-induced desensitization. However, truncation mutant 5 required greater concentrations of PMA to induce desensitization. For example, truncation mutant 5 was ∼65% desensitized at 1 μm PMA, a concentration that fully desensitized the wild-type receptor. These data indicate a strong desensitizing effect of PMA on UTP-stimulated Ca2+mobilization. However, exposure of cells to 1 μm PMA for times ranging from 5 to 180 min failed to induce sequestration of wild-type P2Y2 receptors (Fig. 9). Furthermore, co-incubation with 1 μm PMA and 1 mm UTP produced a pattern of sequestration similar to that obtained with UTP alone. These findings suggest no role for PKC in the sequestration of the P2Y2 receptor and thus dissociate receptor desensitization from sequestration. Desensitization of the G protein-coupled P2Y2 receptor can attenuate responses to nucleotides, which may impair the therapeutic effects of nucleotides in treatment of diseases such as cystic fibrosis. G protein-coupled receptor desensitization can involve several protein kinases, including protein kinase A, PKC, and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (reviewed in Ref. 8Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). However, the pathway involved in P2Y2 receptor desensitization is not well understood. P2Y2 receptor activation is coupled to phospholipase C, leading to the production of diacylglycerol, an activator of PKC. The presence of three consensus sites for phosphorylation by PKC and possible sites for G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation in the intracellular domain of the P2Y2 receptor prompted us to investigate the role of the serine/threonine-rich C terminus in agonist-induced P2Y2receptor desensitization. It has been established in this study that the recombinant P2Y2 receptor expressed in 1321N1 cells desensitizes like the endogenous receptor in bovine aortic endothelial cells (7Wilkinson G.F. Purkiss J.R. Boarder M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 731-736PubMed Google Scholar). Desensitization of the P2Y2 receptor occurs in response to UTP or activation of PKC with PMA, although in some cells, PKC may not mediate P2Y2 receptor desensitization (22Gonzalez F.A. Rozengurt E. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4530-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The lack of a reliable radioligand binding assay and antibodies to the endogenous P2Y2 receptor necessitated the incorporation of the HA epitope of influenza virus at the N terminus of the receptor to monitor sequestration with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. Truncation of 30 amino acids from the C terminus of the P2Y2 receptor (truncation mutant 5) increased the concentration of UTP required for receptor desensitization and decreased the ability of these receptors to sequester as efficiently as the wild-type P2Y2 receptor. This trend was also exhibited with truncation mutants 3 and 4. However, truncation mutant 2 had a similar UTP concentration response for desensitization, but different sequestration properties compared with the wild-type P2Y2 receptor, whereas truncation mutant 1 desensitized and sequestered like the wild-type receptor. The cause for the change in sequestration properties that occurred between truncation mutants 1 and 2 requires further investigation, but may involve the loss of one or more essential amino acids from truncation mutant 2 that impact on sequestration, but not desensitization. Clearly, these changes do not affect receptor activation since UTP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i for all the recombinant P2Y2 receptor constructs had similar concentration-response curves. The wild-type P2Y2 receptor lacks any cysteine residues in its C terminus that are apparently required for palmitoylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (23O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the formation of tertiary structure required for agonist-induced receptor desensitization (25Moffett S. Mouillac B. Bonin H. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The wild-type P2Y2 receptor expressed in 1321N1 cells desensitizes and sequesters in a time-dependent manner similar to other GPCRs, and although the P2Y2 receptor recovers from desensitization like other GPCRs, its recovery from sequestration is slower (11Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 351-359PubMed Google Scholar). It may be that the presence of the HA epitope affects the sequestration kinetics of the P2Y2receptor, but until reliable radioligands are developed for this receptor, we are unable to address this question. Although de novo protein synthesis may be responsible for recovery of some receptor activity, resensitization is more likely due to receptor recycling given the short incubation period with UTP. However, recovery from receptor sequestration was difficult to evaluate in cells expressing truncation mutant 5 because of the necessity to incubate these cells for 180 min (a period that may involve receptor down-regulation) to get adequate sequestration. Experiments on transcriptional regulation of the endogenous P2Y2 receptor will be necessary to determine the mechanisms of recovery from receptor down-regulation. Truncations of the carboxyl-terminal tail of G protein-coupled receptors can have a wide range of effects on receptor desensitization and sequestration. Truncation of the terminal 45 amino acids of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor inhibited receptor internalization with no effect on radioligand binding, downstream signaling, or agonist-induced desensitization (27Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Removal of 72 of 86 amino acids from the C terminus of the serotonin type 2 receptor had no effect on the ability of the receptor to stimulate phospholipase C or to be internalized even though three of five PKC consensus phosphorylation sites and potential G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation sites were removed (28Vouret-Craviari V. Auberger P. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4813-4821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the authors noted the presence in the truncated and wild-type 5HT2 receptors of the consensus NPXXY sequence, in which the tyrosine residue has been reported to be essential for β2-adrenergic receptor sequestration. In contrast, Thomas et al. (27Thomas W.G. Thekkumkara T.J. Motel T.J. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have reported the presence of an NPXXY sequence in an internalization-resistant mutant of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor. The P2Y2 receptor has a DPXXY sequence that remains after the most radical truncation (truncation mutant 5), and it will be of interest to see if this tyrosine residue has any role in receptor sequestration. Another study of the phospholipase C-linked G protein-coupled α1B-adrenergic receptor indicated the importance of the C terminus in agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation and desensitization (29Lattion A.-L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 147-amino acid truncation of the C terminus of the α1B-adrenergic receptor did not decrease agonist-induced inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate accumulation compared with the wild-type α1B-adrenergic receptor. However, the truncated receptor was resistant to desensitization and was not phosphorylated in response to activation by its ligand, epinephrine. The truncated α1B-adrenergic receptor was able to sequester, but more slowly than the wild-type receptor. Removal of 43 amino acids from the C terminus of the lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (30Sanchez-Yague J. Rodriguez M.C. Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7217-7220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 48 amino acids from the C terminus of the β2-adrenergic receptor (31Bouvier M. Hausdorff W.P. De Blasi A. O'Dowd B.F. Kobilka B.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) led to a decrease in agonist-induced uncoupling of the receptors from adenylyl cyclase. Compared with the wild-type β2-adrenergic receptor, the truncation mutant required longer periods of agonist exposure to desensitize, presumably indicating the importance of β-adrenergic receptor kinase phosphorylation sites that were lost upon receptor truncation. It will be of interest to investigate the specific amino acid residues of the P2Y2 receptor that are involved in both desensitization and sequestration of this receptor. Fredericks et al. (9Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) identified G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation sites in the β2-adrenergic receptor and found similarities between these sites and those found in rhodopsin. The most amino-terminal phosphorylation site in both rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor has pairs of acidic residues at its amino-terminal side. Truncation mutant 3 of the P2Y2receptor truncates the receptor directly after two acidic residues and directly before a serine residue. It is tempting to speculate the importance of these amino acids in P2Y2 receptor function since truncation mutant 3 is the least truncated form of the P2Y2 receptor used in this study that required an increased concentration of UTP to induce desensitization compared with the wild-type receptor. Very few studies have directly investigated the role of functionally important domains of P2Y receptors. Specific amino acids in the transmembrane-spanning domains of the P2Y2 (32Erb L. Garrad R. Wang Y. Quinn T. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4185-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and P2Y1 (33Jiang Q. Guo D. Lee B.X. van Rhee A.M. Kim Y.-L. Nicholas R.A. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) receptors have been shown to affect agonist potency and specificity. The present study has defined the importance of the C terminus of the P2Y2 receptor in desensitization and sequestration. Considering the widely varying roles of the C terminus in G protein-coupled receptor functions, future studies should better delineate the relevance of this domain to P2Y2receptor regulation. Studies are also needed to fully evaluate the role of PKC and other protein kinases in the desensitization and sequestration of the P2Y2 receptor. A complete understanding of the signaling pathways involved may help minimize receptor desensitization and sequestration to optimize nucleotide therapies, such as those proposed for cystic fibrosis, that are directed at the P2Y2 receptor.

One group formed by the auto-oxidation of arachidonic acid, the F2-iPs, consists of four classes of isomers of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α). They are relatively abundant in human urine. This fact, along with their chemical stability and excellent characteristics for quantitation by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, has made them attractive indices of oxidative stress in humans.

Since oxidant stress has been implicated in many diseases as well as in physiological processes such as aging, there is interest in the rational development of antioxidant drugs. A paucity of noninvasive, sensitive, specific methods for monitoring the oxidative status of individual patients has constrained such efforts and limited insight into the role of reactive oxidant species in human disease. Since the discovery of F2 isoprostanes (F2-iPs)1 (1Wendelborn D.F. Seibert K. Roberts L.J. II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Morrow J.D.

A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), the quantitation of these compounds in urine and serum has shown promise as an approach to the study of oxidative stress (3Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J., II Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 4Patrono C. FitzGerald G.A. Arterioscler. Throm. Vascb. Biol. 1997; 17: 2309-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Immunoassay and GC/MS techniques have been used for quantitation of iPs. Immunoassays are relatively quick and technically simple (5Wang Z. Ciabattoni G. Creminon C. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Patrono C. Maclouf J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 94-100PubMed Google Scholar), but assays for iPs in urine require, due to nonspecific reactivity, some degree of purification before quantitation, introducing the possibility of uncontrolled loss of analyte. Also, antibodies raised against a specific F2-iPs may cross-react with other isomers or their largely uncharacterized metabolites. Since only a few of the 64 potential F2-iP and only one metabolite have been synthesized, this cross-reactivity is difficult to assess. GC/MS assays to date have utilized capillary gas chromatography/negative ion electron capture chemical ionization mass spectrometry and have targeted either F2-iPs as a class or have attempted to measure a single isomer. Those approaches that measure multiple isomers (6Morrow J.D. Frei B. Longmire A.W. Gaziano J.M. Lynch S.N. Shyr Y. Strauss W.E. Oates J.A. Roberts L.J., II N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar) compare the area under a number of overlapping peaks to that under a single peak corresponding to a stable isotope-labeled internal standard and are relatively straightforward, technically. However, inadequate purification of such samples can lead to the presence of spurious peaks in the integrated region, whereas stringent purification can lead to the loss of some isomers. On the other hand, assays attempting to measure a single isomer from the myriad present require a high degree of sample purification. This is labor-intensive and may result in low yields and/or chromatographically heterogeneous peaks. We have published descriptions of two stable isotope dilution assays for specific F2-iPs: iPF2α-III, 2This paper adheres to our recent proposal for the naming of isoprostanes (25Rokach J.

The compound formerly known as 8-iso-PGF2α, 8-epi-PGF2α, or IPF2α-IV is now iPF2α-III. Likewise, the compound formerly known as IPF2α-I is now iPF2α-VI. For representative structures, see Fig. 1.2This paper adheres to our recent proposal for the naming of isoprostanes (25Rokach J. Khanapure S.P. Hwang S.-W. Adiyaman M. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A.

The former is very difficult to purify to homogeneity. The latter is present in greater quantities and takes advantage of the unique characteristics of class VI F2-iPs to form a cyclic lactone (Fig. 1), which provides a means of separating them from class III–V F2-iPs (8Praticò D.

Unidentified peaks in the GC/MS chromatograms from the iPF2α-VI urinary assay made us suspect that other members of class VI might be present in even greater concentrations than iPF2α-VI.Since little information concerning the composition of the array of F2-iPs in urine is available (9Waugh R.J.

We now identify 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI and 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI (Fig. 2), using our synthetic standards, as the two most abundant F2-iPs yet observed in human urine. Given their abundance, these compounds represent a logical target for F2-iP quantitation by GC/MS, HPLC/ESI/MS/MS, or immunoassay.Figure 2Structures of 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI (left) and 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Unless otherwise stated, all solvents were B&J High Purity (Burdick & Jackson, Muskegon, MI).N, N-Diisopropylethylamine and pentafluorobenzyl bromide were purchased from Sigma. 1-Butaneboronic acid was purchased from Aldrich. Bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide was purchased from Supelco Inc. (Bellefonte, PA).Synthesis of 8,12-Iso-iPF2α-VI and Its 5R- IsomerBriefly, the first total synthesis of 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI and its 5R-epimer, (5R)-8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI, was performed using a key intermediate, the all-syn six-membered ring lactone (4aR,5S,7R,7aS)-hexahydro-3-oxo-5,7-bis[tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]cyclopentapyran, which was prepared from diacetonide-d-glucose. The details of the syntheses of these two class VI isoprostanes will be published elsewhere.Solid-phase ExtractionA RapidTrace SPE workstation (Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, MA) was used for all extractions. Reverse-phase cartridges (C18 EC, 100 mg; International Sorbent Technology, Mid Glamorgan, United Kingdom) were primed with 3 ml of methanol followed by 0.5 ml of 0.8 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Urine samples (1–3 ml) were applied at 1 ml/min, and the cartridge was washed with 1 ml of 25% ethanol/buffer at 1 ml/min. The cartridge was dried with 3 × 5 ml of air (30 ml/min) and eluted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate at 1 ml/min.HPLCHPLC was performed on an ABI 140B solvent delivery system (Perkin-Elmer) utilizing a Hypersil BDS C18 column (2 × 150 mm) packed with 3-μm particles with 130-Å pore size (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA). The flow rate was 200 μl/min. The column effluent was split, with 25% going to the electrospray source and the remainder to waste. For GC/MS analysis, fractions were hand-collected from the effluent stream by monitoring the real-time update of the HPLC/ESI/MS/MS data. The mobile phase was programmed from 25 to 35% mobile phase B in 20 min, held for 20 min, and then programmed to 90% mobile phase B. Mobile phase A consisted of deionized distilled water, with the pH adjusted to 5.7 with acetic acid. Mobile phase B was 95% acetonitrile and 5% methanol. Samples were injected by a Hewlett-Packard Series 1100 autosampler.Electrospray Ionization/Tandem Mass SpectrometryAll MS/MS analyses were performed on a MicroMass Quattro II instrument interfaced with a MicroMass ESI source. Instrument control, data acquisition, and data analysis were achieved with MassLynx software. Conditions were as follows: nebulizer gas flow, 30 liter/h; drying gas flow, 300 liter/h; spray potential, −3000 V; cone potential, −40 V; and collisional offset potential, 23 V. Argon was used for the collision gas. Q2 scans were acquired at a rate of 225 atomic mass units/s. For multiple reaction monitoring, each ion was monitored for 0.15 s.DerivatizationThe PFB ester was formed by adding 10 μl of N, N-diisopropylethylamine and 20 μl 10% PFB bromide in acetonitrile to the dry sample. The sample was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen after standing for 10 min at room temperature. The TMS ether was formed by adding 10 μl each of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and pyridine and allowing the sample to stand at room temperature for 10 min. Then-butyl boronate TMS derivative was formed by adding 10 μl of n-butylboronic acid (20 mg/ml) to the sample and allowing it to stand for 60 min at room temperature and then adding 10 μl of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and allowing the sample to stand at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were dried and dissolved in dodecane prior to injection into the GC/MS.Gas Chromatography/Mass SpectrometryAll of the GC/MS analyses were performed on an MD-800 mass spectrometer interfaced with a GC-8060 gas chromatograph and an AS-800 autosampler (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA). For GC, a 30 m × 0.25-mm, 0.25-μm coating, DB5-MS column (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) was used. The carrier gas was helium. The temperature program consisted of an initial temperature of 190 °C (1 min) and then a programmed increase to 320 °C at 20 °C/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion (electron capture) chemical ionization mode using ammonia as the moderating gas. Ions monitored are m/z 569 for the PFB ester TMS derivative and m/z 451 for the PFB cyclic n-butyl boronate TMS derivative.DISCUSSIONF2-iPs have the potential to fill the critical need for a noninvasive marker of oxidative stress in vivo. They are believed to arise solely from the free radical-mediated peroxidation of phospholipid-bound arachidonic acid. They are cleaved, presumably by an unidentified phospholipase A2, and can be found in circulation (6Morrow J.D. Frei B. Longmire A.W. Gaziano J.M. Lynch S.N. Shyr Y. Strauss W.E. Oates J.A.

Immunoassays have also been used to study F2-iPs in syndromes of oxidative stress (5Wang Z. Ciabattoni G. Creminon C. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Patrono C. Maclouf J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 94-100PubMed Google Scholar,16Davi G. Allessandrini P. Mezzetti A. Minotti G. Bucciarelli T. Constantini F. Cipollone F. Bon G.G. Ciabattoni G. Patrono C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).Although GC/MS quantitation of F2-iPs as a group is possible with the inclusion of a single deuterated internal standard, we have taken the approach of monitoring a single isomer, using the stable isotope-labeled homolog as an internal standard. The first such method, measuring iPF2α-III, was used effectively, but purifying a single isomer from the 64 potential F2-iPs to homogeneity proved to be highly labor-intensive. We then synthesized iPF2α-VI, the class VI isomer with stereochemistry analogous to iPF2α-III, and its tetradeuterated analog to take advantage of the ability of this class to form a cyclic lactone. Formation of the lactone facilitates their separation from class III–V F2-iPs. The presence of relatively large peaks, other than iPF2α-VI, in the GC/MS chromatogram suggested that other isomers of class VI F2-iPs were present in urine at concentrations approaching or exceeding that of iPF2α-VI. Using HPLC/ESI/MS/MS techniques that are completely, or to a large degree, specific for each of the four classes of F2-iPs, we observed two large peaks in the ion chromatogram representing the class VI F2-iPs. They are among the most abundant compounds of any class (data not shown).LC/MS/MS spectra of synthetic iPF2α-III and presumptive isomers of classes IV and VI, isolated from rat livers treated with carbon tetrachloride, have been published (9Waugh R.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Murphy R.C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Spectra of unambiguous synthetic representatives of classes IV–VI are presented here for the first time. These published spectra, along with our unpublished observations, 3J. A. Lawson, H. Li, J. Rokach, M. Adiyaman, S.-W. Hwang, S. P. Khanapure, and G. A. FitzGerald, unpublished data. indicate that members of each class of F2-iPs share similar MS characteristics. Thus, the four synthetic class VI compounds mentioned above show no significant differences in their collision-induced dissociation spectra.Realizing that the only positive identification possible of any single isomer from the array of F2-iPs is by comparison with synthetic standards, we began the process of eliminating possible candidates for the two unknowns. We first eliminated members of classes III–V by examination of the collision-induced dissociation spectra atm/z 353, which were identical to the spectra of synthetic iPF2α-VI and 5-epi-iPF2α-VI and the published spectrum of a putative class VI iP (9Waugh R.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Murphy R.C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We then applied the findings of the seminal investigations of O'Connor et al. (17O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3577-3584Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar) into the auto-oxidative cyclization of trienes to form PGF-ring compounds. Elimination of the isomers with trans-ring substituents, which they found to be minor components, decreased the number of possible class VI isomers from 16 to 8. They also showed that theendo, endo-bicyclo-endoperoxides, with endoperoxide and side chains on the same side of the ring (as in 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI), are predominant over theexo, exo-bicyclo forms, in which the peroxide and side chains are on opposite sides of the ring (as in iPF2α-VI). This reduces the list of candidates to four, namely 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI and 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI (which we synthesized) and their enantiomers. Identical MS/MS spectra and co-chromatography on reverse-phase HPLC/ESI/MS/MS and on GC/MS as two different derivatives confirmed their identity. When HPLC peaks were collected and analyzed by GC/MS, no significant contamination of either peak I or II by other F2-iPs was observed. Since it would be unlikely that two or more isomers that coeluted on LC would also coelute on GC, which uses a different method of separation, this indicates that the unknown peaks are substantially pure and are not made artifactually large by the coelution of two or more compounds. The present data do not allow conclusions regarding the enantiomeric composition of the unknown peaks.The metabolism of one F2-iP, iPF2α-III, has been investigated to some degree, with a small, but undetermined percentage of radioactivity infused into a human volunteer being excreted unchanged (18Roberts L.J., II Moore K.P. Zackert W.E. Oates J.A. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20617-20620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Nothing is known of the metabolism of class VI F2-iPs.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21771-21778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have observed, in the study of leukotriene C4 and E4 metabolism, that β-oxidation proceeded from the ω-end. This was interpreted as a slowdown of the metabolism of the side chain, possibly due to an interference by the hydroxyl group at C-5, and may explain the large amount of intact leukotriene E4 excreted in urine (23Rokach J. Malo L. Ethier D. Cartier A. Girard Y. Charleson S. O'Byrne P.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1990; 868: 211-220Google Scholar). It is possible that the C-5 hydroxyl group of class VI isoprostanes could be a factor in the observation that this class seems to be more abundant in urine than the other series, e.g. the concentration of iPF2α-VI is ∼4-fold that of the class III stereochemical analog, iPF2α-III. Evaluation of this hypothesis will require a more thorough quantitation of these iPs from sources that are unaffected by metabolism and/or excretion.Knowledge of the structure of these compounds, along with the synthesis of their tetradeuterated analogs for use in stable isotope dilution assays, will allow for the development of more sensitive GC/MS and HPLC/ESI/MS/MS methods for F2-iP analysis. Specifically, these will take advantage of the unique ability of class VI F2-iPs to form a cyclic lactone and hence be easily separated from other F2-iP classes. Each of these peaks is present in ∼5-fold greater yield, as judged by their respective LC/MS/MS areas, than the most abundant F2-iP yet identified in human urine, iPF2α-VI (8Praticò D. Barry O.P. Lawson J.A. Adiyaman M. Hwang S.-W. Khanapure S.P. Iuliano L. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3449-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Given the interest in microdetection of iPs in mouse models of oxidant stress, these compounds have particular appeal as F2-iP analytes. They are also potentially attractive targets for immunoassay development, immunolocalization studies (24Praticò D. Juliano J. Mauriello A. Spagnoli S. Lawson J. Rokach J. Maclouf J. Violi F. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2028-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and extension of this methodology to large-scale clinical trials. Since oxidant stress has been implicated in many diseases as well as in physiological processes such as aging, there is interest in the rational development of antioxidant drugs. A paucity of noninvasive, sensitive, specific methods for monitoring the oxidative status of individual patients has constrained such efforts and limited insight into the role of reactive oxidant species in human disease. Since the discovery of F2 isoprostanes (F2-iPs)1 (1Wendelborn D.F. Seibert K. Roberts L.J. II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Morrow J.D.

A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), the quantitation of these compounds in urine and serum has shown promise as an approach to the study of oxidative stress (3Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J., II Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 4Patrono C. FitzGerald G.A. Arterioscler. Throm. Vascb. Biol. 1997; 17: 2309-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Immunoassay and GC/MS techniques have been used for quantitation of iPs. Immunoassays are relatively quick and technically simple (5Wang Z. Ciabattoni G. Creminon C. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Patrono C. Maclouf J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 94-100PubMed Google Scholar), but assays for iPs in urine require, due to nonspecific reactivity, some degree of purification before quantitation, introducing the possibility of uncontrolled loss of analyte. Also, antibodies raised against a specific F2-iPs may cross-react with other isomers or their largely uncharacterized metabolites. Since only a few of the 64 potential F2-iP and only one metabolite have been synthesized, this cross-reactivity is difficult to assess. GC/MS assays to date have utilized capillary gas chromatography/negative ion electron capture chemical ionization mass spectrometry and have targeted either F2-iPs as a class or have attempted to measure a single isomer. Those approaches that measure multiple isomers (6Morrow J.D. Frei B. Longmire A.W. Gaziano J.M. Lynch S.N. Shyr Y. Strauss W.E. Oates J.A. Roberts L.J., II N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar) compare the area under a number of overlapping peaks to that under a single peak corresponding to a stable isotope-labeled internal standard and are relatively straightforward, technically. However, inadequate purification of such samples can lead to the presence of spurious peaks in the integrated region, whereas stringent purification can lead to the loss of some isomers. On the other hand, assays attempting to measure a single isomer from the myriad present require a high degree of sample purification. This is labor-intensive and may result in low yields and/or chromatographically heterogeneous peaks. We have published descriptions of two stable isotope dilution assays for specific F2-iPs: iPF2α-III, 2This paper adheres to our recent proposal for the naming of isoprostanes (25Rokach J. Khanapure S.P. Hwang S.-W. Adiyaman M. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Prostaglandins. 1997; 54: 853-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The compound formerly known as 8-iso-PGF2α, 8-epi-PGF2α, or IPF2α-IV is now iPF2α-III. Likewise, the compound formerly known as IPF2α-I is now iPF2α-VI.

The former is very difficult to purify to homogeneity. The latter is present in greater quantities and takes advantage of the unique characteristics of class VI F2-iPs to form a cyclic lactone (Fig. 1), which provides a means of separating them from class III–V F2-iPs (8Praticò D. Barry O.P. Lawson J.A. Adiyaman M. Hwang S.-W. Khanapure S.P. Iuliano L. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3449-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Unidentified peaks in the GC/MS chromatograms from the iPF2α-VI urinary assay made us suspect that other members of class VI might be present in even greater concentrations than iPF2α-VI. Since little information concerning the composition of the array of F2-iPs in urine is available (9Waugh R.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Murphy R.C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Rokach J. Khanapure S.P. Hwang S.-W. Adiyaman M. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Prostaglandins. 1997; 54: 823-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we have developed methods utilizing HPLC/ESI/MS/MS for characterizing them with the hope of identifying individual isomers that are more amenable to quantitation than the two for which we have developed assays to date. We now identify 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI and 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI (Fig. 2), using our synthetic standards, as the two most abundant F2-iPs yet observed in human urine. Given their abundance, these compounds represent a logical target for F2-iP quantitation by GC/MS, HPLC/ESI/MS/MS, or immunoassay.

No PSII activity could be detected in this mutant either in oxygen evolution assays or by analysis of variable chlorophyll fluorescence. Immunoblotting experiments showed that the absence of PSII activity in the mutant was due to the loss of the PSII complex in both light-grown and dark-grown cultures. In contrast, the photosystem one reaction center polypeptide, PsaA, was present at wild-type levels in the mutant. RNA gel blot assays confirmed that the transcript levels for the psbA, psbD, and psbF genes were unaffected by disruption of thepsbE gene, suggesting a post-transcriptional effect on their expression. Pulse-labeling experiments showed that either synthesis of PSII subunits was impaired in the psbE null mutant or there was extremely rapid degradation of newly synthesized subunits. Interestingly, the PsbE and PsbF subunits accumulated to wild-type levels in a psbA deletion mutant of C. reinhardtii, FuD7, which fails to synthesize D1 and assemble PSII. Our results provide evidence for a role for cytochromeb-559 in the early steps of assembly of the PSII complex, possibly as a redox-controlled nucleation factor that determines the level of PSII within the thylakoid membrane.

Photosystem two (PSII)1is a multisubunit complex within the thylakoid membrane that catalyzes the light-induced oxidation of water to molecular oxygen as well as the reduction of plastoquinone to plastoquinol (1Barber J. Nield J. Morris E.P. Zheleva D. Hankamer B. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 817-827Crossref Google Scholar). At the heart of PSII is a the reaction center (RC) complex composed of the polypeptides D1, D2, PsbI, and a transmembrane b-type cytochrome termed cytochrome b-559 (2Satoh K. Deisenhofer J. Norris S.J. The Photosynthetic Reaction Center. I. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1993: 289-318Google Scholar). As yet, the function of this cytochrome within PSII is unresolved, but it probably plays a role in protecting the PSII RC from photoinactivation, possibly by acting as a source of electrons to reduce long-lived chlorophyll cation species within the PSII RC (3Thompson L.K. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6653-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), which unless reduced would oxidize nearby amino acids within the protein complex (4Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The structure of Cyt b-559 is quite unusual, as it is thought to be a heterodimer of two subunits arranged in parallel orientations: the α subunit encoded by psbE and the β subunit encoded by psbF (5Herrmann R.G. Alt J.G. Schiller B. Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 239-244Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The haem molecule is likely to be ligated by the single histidine residues within each subunit (6Babcock G.T. Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Oertling W.A. Metz J.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3638-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although an αβ heterodimeric structure for Cyt b-559 is generally favored, recent work has demonstrated that the genetic fusion of the N terminus of the β subunit to the C terminus of the α subunit in Synechocystis 6803 leads to the assembly of a functional cytochrome b-559 (7McNamara V.P. Sutterwala F.S. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14173-14178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because the αβ heterodimer model requires that the N termini of the monotopic α and β subunits lie on the same side of the membrane, the fusion of PsbE and PsbF without loss of PSII activity has been interpreted in terms of an α2/β2 homodimeric structure for Cytb-559 with one haem bound to α2 and one to β2 (7McNamara V.P. Sutterwala F.S. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14173-14178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). If this interpretation is correct, then Cytb-559 would contain 2 haems and 2 copies each of α and β. One way to investigate the roles of psbE and psbFin PSII function is to construct specific null mutants. In the transformable cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, as with all higher plants, psbE and psbF are cotranscribed with the downstream genes, psbL and psbJ (8Pakrasi H.B. De Ciechi P. Whitmarsh J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which also encode PSII subunits (9Lind L.K. Shukla V.K. Nyhus K.J. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1575-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Anbudurai P.R. Pakrasi H.B. Z. Naturforsch. 1993; 48: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The effect of mutating either psbE or psbF on PSII function is therefore complicated by possible polar effects on gene expression within this operon. This potential problem is highlighted by the work of Shukla and co-workers (11Shukla V.K. Stanbekova G.E. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which showed that the presence of a stop codon within the coding sequence for PsbE in a spontaneous mutant of Synechocystis 6803 led to loss of the entirepsbEFLJ transcript. Early studies showed that deletion of the entire psbEFLJoperon in Synechocystis led to loss of PSII activity (12Pakrasi H.B. Williams J.G.K. Arntzen C.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,13Pakrasi H.B. Diner B.A. Williams J.G.K. Arntzen C.J. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 591-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in light-grown cultures to a failure to accumulate D2 and to a reduction in the levels of D1 and the PSII subunits CP47 and CP43 to about 50% of WT (11Shukla V.K. Stanbekova G.E. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Whether the loss of PSII activity in this mutant is due to increased rates of photoinactivation has not been resolved. Deletion of psbF also leads to loss of PSII activity (14Pakrasi H.B. Nyhus K.J. Granok H. Z. Naturforsch. 1990; 45: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that the β subunit alone is crucial for assembly of PSII. However, the stability of the psbEFLJ transcript was not investigated in the psbF mutant, so it remains possible that expression of the other genes within the operon had also been affected. In addition to Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the green algaChlamydomonas reinhardtii is also widely used to study PSII through genetic means. Because of its eukaryotic nature,Chlamydomonas is possibly a more appropriate model system with which to study photosynthesis in higher plants (15Rochaix J.-D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 209-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Unlike cyanobacteria and higher plants, the psbEFJL operon is naturally disrupted in C. reinhardtii. The psbF gene is cotranscribed with the downstream psbL gene (16Mor T.S. Ohad I. Hirschberg J. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereaspsbE is located approximately 7.3 kb away and transcribed in the opposite direction (16Mor T.S. Ohad I. Hirschberg J. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Alizadeh S. Nechushtai R. Barber J. Nixon P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This gene arrangement should thus allow the specific disruption of the psbE gene without affecting transcription of the psbF and psbLgenes. In this paper, we report on the construction and characterization of the first chloroplast psbE null mutant. Our results demonstrate the importance of the PsbE protein for assembly of PSII both in the light and the dark and suggest a model in which cytochromeb-559, besides having a role in electron transfer, also acts as a nucleation factor in the assembly of PSII. 2A preliminary report of this work has been presented (18Morais F.

C. reinhardtiiwild-type strain CC-125 was obtained from the ChlamydomonasCulture Collection (CGC, Dept. of Botany, Duke University, Durham, NC), and the chloroplast PSII mutant, FuD7 (19Bennoun P.

Cells were grown on plates or in liquid culture at 20–25 °C under dim light (20–50 μE·m−2 s−1) or in the dark in Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) or high-salt minimal media (20Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar). The transformants were maintained on TAP medium containing 100 μg/ml spectinomycin, 10 μm3-[3,4-dichlorophenyl]-1,1-dimethyl urea, and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid pF1 is a derivative of plasmid p78 (which contains the 15.1-kb PstI-4 fragment from the chloroplast genome of C. reinhardtii cloned into pBR322) (20Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar) and was constructed by digesting p78 with EcoRI to remove a 5.8-kb fragment followed by religation. pF1 contains thepsbE gene with upstream and downstream flanking sequences of approximately 8 and 2 kb, respectively (Fig. 1). To disrupt the psbE gene, a 1.9-kb spectinomycin-resistance cassette was isolated from plasmid pUC-atpX-AAD (21Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) after digestion with EcoRV and SmaI and ligated into theAlwNI site found within the psbE gene, after the ends were made blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, to yield plasmid pF1aad. Standard methods were used to generate the recombinant DNA plasmids (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Transformants were selected on TAP plates containing 100 μg/ml spectinomycin. Spectinomycin-resistant colonies were restreaked three to four times on TAP plates containing spectinomycin before their genotypes were analyzed. The isolation of total Chlamydomonas DNA and DNA gel blot analyses were performed according to Ref. 23Andronis C. Kruse O. Deák Z. Vass I. Diner B.A. Nixon P.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. Total RNA was isolated from 100-ml cultures of mid-log phase Chlamydomonas cells as described in Ref. 24Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, in the presence of 100 μm aurintricarboxylic acid (Sigma). RNA was electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham International), and hybridized to 32P random-labeled specific DNA probes using the SSPE/formamide system as described (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To confirm the homoplasmicity of the psbE insertion mutants 3 and 4, a PCR analysis was performed using primers flanking thepsbE gene. PCR reactions were performed in a Techne PHC-3 thermocycler following typical protocols (25Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 3-12Google Scholar) in the presence of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The oligonucleotides used as primers for PCR were SA1 (5′-TTGTTTCAATGGGGCATTAT-3′; located 407 base pairs upstream the psbE initiation codon), SA5 (5′-ATAGATGGTTTGAAAAGG-3′; located 301 base pairs downstream thepsbE initiation codon), and B (5′-CACTGCCTCTAATAAAGTC-3′; located within the aadA cassette) (Fig. 1). For WT, primers SA1 and SA5 amplified a 0.75-kb fragment, whereas in strains 3 and 4, a 2.65-kb fragment was generated because of the presence of the 1.9-kb spectinomycin-resistance cassette (data not shown). No 0.75-kb band was amplified from strains 3 and 4 consistent with the absence of WT copies of the psbE gene. Using primers SA1 and B, a 0.5-kb fragment was amplified from strains 3 and 4 but not from the WT (data not shown). Light-induced O2-evolution activity in whole cells was measured with a Clark-type electrode. The measurements were performed in TAP medium at 25 °C, under saturating light conditions, in the presence of 1 mm potassium ferricyanide and 1 mm2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone. Fluorescence induction kinetics of dark adapted cells, on TAP plates, were performed using a pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometer (PAM 101, Walz) using a white actinic light of intensity (1000 μE·m−2s−1). Thylakoid membranes were prepared as described (26Diner B.A. Wollman F.-A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.1 mm Pefablock (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 mmphenanthroline, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μmleupeptin). The isolation was carried out essentially in the dark at 4 °C, and throughout the procedure the chlorophyll concentration was measured according to the method of Arnon (27Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The separation of protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the immunodetection of protein was performed using methods described in Ref. 23Andronis C. Kruse O. Deák Z. Vass I. Diner B.A. Nixon P.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. Visualization of bound antibody was performed by using a secondary antibody conjugated either to alkaline phosphatase (23Andronis C. Kruse O. Deák Z. Vass I. Diner B.A. Nixon P.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or to horseradish peroxidase, in the latter case followed by detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Antisera specific for the α and β subunits of Cyt b-559 from C. reinhardtii were raised against 17-mer oligopeptides derived from the deduced N-terminal sequences of PsbE (AGKPVERPFSDILTSIR) and PsbF (acetyl-TTKKSAEVLVYPIFTVR) (17Alizadeh S. Nechushtai R. Barber J. Nixon P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with the oligopeptides in the form of multiple antigenic peptides (purchased from Alta Bioscience, UK) following standard methodologies (28Harlow E. Lane D.

Chlamydomonas cells were labeled with [35S]sulfate essentially as described. 3J.-D. Rochaix, personal communication. Cells were grown under white light at 20–50 μE·m−2 s−1 to early exponential phase (1–2 × 106 cells/ml, approximately A 750 of 0.2–0.3) in TAP. The cells were pelleted (10 min, 1500 rpm, Chillspin benchtop centrifuge, room temperature), washed once in TAP-RS (reduced sulfur) (TAP made with Beijerinck's solution (20Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar) without sulfate but still containing trace elements that contain sulfur), resuspended in the same medium to 107 cells/ml, and incubated overnight under the original growth conditions. After another wash, the cells were resuspended in TAP-S (minus sulfur) (TAP containing no trace elements and made with Beijerinck's solution lacking sulfate) for 2 h, under 1000 μE·m−2 s−1, and then incubated with cycloheximide (Sigma) at 10 μg/ml for 10 min. Pulse labeling of cells was performed with carrier-free Na235SO4 (stock at 0.9 mCi/ml, ICN) at 0.1 mCi/ml for 5 min. Aliquots of cultures were immediately centrifuged, and cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C. The cells were subsequently washed once with 50 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.5, containing 5 mm EDTA and a mixture of protease inhibitors (as described previously) and solubilized for 1 h in an equal volume of solubilization buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing 6 m urea, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and exposed to x-ray film. DNA sequencing was first performed to identify further genes in the vicinity of psbE. In agreement with Ref. 32Boudreau E. Takahashi Y. Lemieux C. Turmel M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, a putative rps9gene, encoding the S9 subunit of the plastid ribosome, and the highly conserved ycf4 gene, which is involved in the assembly of PSI (32Boudreau E. Takahashi Y. Lemieux C. Turmel M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), lie downstream of psbE (Fig. 1). Northern blots indicate, however, that psbE is not cotranscribed with these genes so that disruption of psbE would not be expected to affect their expression (16Mor T.S. Ohad I. Hirschberg J. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Boudreau E. Takahashi Y. Lemieux C. Turmel M. Rochaix J.-D.

University of London, 1995Google Scholar). To generate a psbE null mutant of C. reinhardtii, a donor plasmid, designated pF1aad, was first constructed from the parental plasmid, pF1, by insertion of a spectinomycin-resistance cassette into an AlwNI site located 26 codons into the coding region of psbE (Fig. 1). This construct was introduced into the chloroplast of WT C. reinhardtii using the biolistic technique developed by Boynton and co-workers (34Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Hosler J.P. Johnson A.M. Jones A.R. Randolph-Anderson B.L. Robertson D. Klein T.D. Shark K.B. Sanford J.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”) and transformants selected on spectinomycin. Fig. 2 shows a Southern blot of total DNA isolated from three spectinomycin-resistant colonies (designated 1, 3, and 4) obtained from the transformation experiment. Two of the spectinomycin-resistant strains (3 and 4) gave a profile diagnostic for homologous recombination of the interrupted psbE gene into the chloroplast genome (Fig. 2 A). A psbE-specific probe hybridized to a 1.9-kb HindIII fragment in the WT but to 1.4-kb and 0.9-kb HindIII fragments in these mutants. As expected, these mutants also contained the spectinomycin-resistance cassette (Fig. 2 B). Spectinomycin-resistant strain 1 gave a WT-like profile and did not contain the spectinomycin cassette. Presumably, spectinomycin resistance arose in this strain through a spontaneous mutation. The data presented in Fig. 2 also indicate that mutants 3 and 4 were homoplasmic and did not contain WT copies of thepsbE gene. Homoplasmicity of mutants 3 and 4 was also confirmed by PCR analysis using primers flanking the psbEgene (see “Experimental Procedures” and data not shown). Strains 3 and 4 therefore lack a functional psbE gene and were characterized further. In contrast to WT, the psbE insertion mutants 3 and 4 were unable to grow photoautotrophically on minimal medium either on agar plates or in liquid (Table I). However, the psbE null mutants could be propagated in the presence of acetate either in the light or the dark, although their growth rates in the light were slightly slower than WT (Table I). Mutant cells grown on acetate in the light were tested for light-induced oxygen evolution using a Clark-type electrode. In contrast to WT, no oxygen evolution was detected in strains 3 and 4 either in the presence of bicarbonate (whole chain electron transport) or the artificial electron acceptors 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone and ferricyanide (PSII-mediated electron transport) (Table I).Table IGrowth properties and oxygen-evolving activities of WT and transformant (strains 3 and 4) cellsStrainWT34Growth properties HSM medium+−− TAP (hours per doubling)+ (6–7)+ (16–17)+ (16–17) TAP + spectinomycin + DCMU−++PSII Activity (μmol O2 · mg Chl−1h−1) H2O to NaHCO3∼7000 H2O to DCBQ/FeCN∼15300 Open table in a new tab PSII activity was also investigated by measuring the chlorophyll fluorescence arising from cells of WT and mutant growing on TAP plates in the light. The ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) is a measure of the efficiency of light capture by PSII. The psbE mutants showed no detectable variable fluorescence, consistent with the absence of functional PSII RCs, whereas the WT showed a Fv/Fm ratio of approximately 0.75. Immunoblotting experiments were performed to assess if the PSII RC subunits, D1 and D2, accumulated in the thylakoid membrane in the absence of PsbE when mutant cells were grown in the presence of light. Fig. 3 A shows that both D1 and D2 could not be detected under these conditions. To exclude the possibility that in the absence of PsbE, PSII can be assembled but is more prone to light-induced degradation, cultures grown heterotrophically in the dark were also examined. Fig. 3 Bshows that the levels of D1, D2, CP47, CP43, PsbF, and PsbO (also known as the 33-kDa extrinsic polypeptide) were drastically reduced in thylakoid membranes isolated from dark-grown cultures of thepsbE mutants compared with WT. As judged from a dilution series, CP43 was present at approximately 1–10% of WT levels in strains 3 and 4 (Fig. 3 B), and in overexposed blots D2 was found to accumulate to 1–5% of WT levels (data not shown). The amount of D1 protein in the psbE mutants was below the level of detection, which was estimated to be at 1% of WT levels. As expected PsbE was absent in the mutants (Fig. 3 B). The CP47, PsbO (33-kDa polypeptide), and PsbF subunits could not be detected in the mutant thylakoid membranes (Fig. 3 B). RNA gel blots were performed to examine whether disruption of the psbEgene had effects on the accumulation of mRNA from psbF, located 7.3 kb away on the chromosome, or other PSII genes such aspsbA or psbD. As shown in Fig. 4, the levels of the psbA, psbD, and psbF transcripts were similar in bothpsbE mutant 3 and WT when grown in either the light or the dark in the presence of acetate. As expected, the psbE null mutant failed to accumulate psbE mRNA (Fig. 4). Interestingly, in comparison with the psbA and psbD genes, the level of transcripts arising from thepsbE and psbF genes in the WT appeared to be greater in the dark than the light. Pulse-labeling experiments were performed to investigate the rate of synthesis of plastid-encoded PSII subunits in the absence of the PsbE subunit. To allow visualization of chloroplast-encoded gene products, the pulse experiments were performed in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of cytoplasmic protein synthesis. Immunoblotting was performed to help assign the labeled bands. Fig. 5 shows the profile obtained with cells of WT, mutants 3 and 4, and FuD7, which is a psbAdeletion mutant (19Bennoun P. Spierer-Herz M. Erickson J. Girard-Bascou J. Pierre Y. Delsome M. Rochaix J.-D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As expected, the WT shows good labeling of the D1, D2, CP47, and CP43 proteins. For FuD7, no D1 synthesis was observed, but as previously documented (19Bennoun P. Spierer-Herz M. Erickson J. Girard-Bascou J. Pierre Y. Delsome M. Rochaix J.-D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 35de Vitry C. Olive J. Drapier D. Recouvreur M. Wollman F.-A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 991-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), in the absence of D1 synthesis, some incorporation of the D2, CP43, and CP47 subunits into the thylakoid membrane was detected. Mutants 3 and 4 showed radiolabeling profiles more similar to FuD7 than WT. Of the major PSII subunits, D2 and CP43 were the most conspicuously labeled in thepsbE mutants, although the degree of radiolabeling, as in FuD7, was much less than WT. These results suggested that the rate of synthesis of PSII subunits is reduced in the psbE null mutants or that there is rapid degradation of the subunits in the absence of PsbE. Similar results were also obtained when pulse labeling of the cells was performed in the dark (data not shown). Although FuD7 fails to assemble a functional PSII complex and has depleted levels of D2, CP47, and CP47 compared with the WT (19Bennoun P. Spierer-Herz M. Erickson J. Girard-Bascou J. Pierre Y. Delsome M. Rochaix J.-D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 35de Vitry C. Olive J. Drapier D. Recouvreur M. Wollman F.-A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 991-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the PsbE and PsbF polypeptides could still be detected at WT levels in thylakoid membranes using specific antibodies (Fig. 6). In this paper, we have described the construction of apsbE insertion mutant of C. reinhardtii. A particular advantage of using C. reinhardtii overSynechocystis 6803 to construct such a mutant is that pleiotropic effects on the transcription of the downstreampsbFLJ genes in Synechocystis 6803 are avoided. Disruption of the psbE gene in C. reinhardtiileads to an inability to accumulate subunits of the PSII core complex within the thylakoid membrane in both dark-grown (Fig. 3 B) as well as light-grown material (Fig. 3 A). Loss of PSII is therefore not due to enhanced photoinactivation of the PSII complex, a possibility that was not excluded in the analysis of previousSynechocystis mutants affected in cytochromeb-559 biosynthesis (8Pakrasi H.B. De Ciechi P. Whitmarsh J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Shukla V.K. Stanbekova G.E. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Pakrasi H.B. Williams J.G.K. Arntzen C.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Northern blots confirm that the psbF, psbD, and psbA transcript levels are unaffected in the psbEnull mutants so clearly the inability to assemble PSII lies at a post-transcriptional step. Pulse-labeling experiments revealed that the synthesis of the major PSII core polypeptides was drastically impaired in the psbE null mutants (Fig. 5) consistent with either a block in synthesis or the rapid degradation of newly synthesized proteins because of a failure to assemble them into a stable core complex. A number of PSII null mutants have now been constructed in Chlamydomonas through biolistic transformation. ThepsbH (36Summer E.J. Schmid V.H.R. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and psbK (37Takahashi Y. Matsumoto H. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) mutants, like thepsbE mutant described here, also fail to accumulate PSII. However, in pulse-labeling assays, both the psbH and psbK null mutants show a WT-like profile, indicating that it is the degradation rather than the synthesis of PSII subunits that is affected in these mutants. The labeling pattern for the psbEnull mutant on the other hand is very similar to that of FuD7, which contains a disrupted psbA gene. Our data therefore support a model in which the α subunit is important for promoting synthesis of D1 or for retarding its degradation. As such the α subunit appears to be an important component in the early steps of the assembly of the PSII complex. A role for cytochrome b-559 in the early steps of assembly of PSII is also supported by recent in vitro pulse-chase experiments that have shown that radiolabeled D1 protein can be assembled into the PSII core complex through the stepwise addition of subunits (38van Wijk K.J. Roobol-Boza M. Kettunen R. Andersson B. Aro E.-M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6178-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Whether D2 or cyt b-559 is the first partner for D1 following insertion into the thylakoids remains to be established. However, it is clear that the PsbI subunit found in the isolated PSII RC (2Satoh K. Deisenhofer J. Norris S.J. The Photosynthetic Reaction Center. I. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1993: 289-318Google Scholar) is not required for assembly of PSII (39Künstner P. Guardiola A. Takahashi Y. Rochaix J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9651-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Early studies on the psbEFLJ deletion mutant of Synechocystis indicated that D1 and D2 were absent from the thylakoid membrane but that CP47 and CP43 accumulated to WT levels (12Pakrasi H.B. Williams J.G.K. Arntzen C.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Later work showed that when an additional protease inhibitor, leupeptin, was used to avoid inadvertant proteolysis of thylakoid membrane protein and care taken to avoid saturation of the signals in immunoblotting experiments, the levels of D1, CP43, and CP47 were approximately 50% of WT, and only D2 failed to accumulate (11Shukla V.K. Stanbekova G.E. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here, a mixture of protease inhibitors including leupeptin was used during the isolation of the thylakoid membranes, and in addition whole cell extracts were analyzed (Fig. 5). The absence of D2 in the Synechocystis psbEFLJ mutant has been interpreted in terms of a specific interaction between D2 and cyt b-559 during assembly of PSII (11Shukla V.K. Stanbekova G.E. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, as noted in the Introduction, apsbEFLJ deletion mutant is not an appropriate strain to study the specific role of PsbE or PsbF in PSII assembly, and so it is unclear how far the results in the cyanobacterial psbEFLJmutant can be compared with the algal psbE null mutant described here. It is clear, however, that quite different phenotypes can be displayed by Synechocystis 6803 and Chlamydomonas for the same type of mutation. For example, null mutants of theChlamydomonas psbH (36Summer E.J. Schmid V.H.R. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and psbK (37Takahashi Y. Matsumoto H. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) genes lead to a destabilization of the PSII core complex, reminiscent of the phenotype of the psbE null mutants presented here, whereasSynechocystis 6803 psbH (40Mayers S.R. Dubbs J.M. Vass I. Hideg E. Nagy L. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1454-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and psbK(41Ikeuchi M. Eggers B. Shen G. Webber A., Yu, J. Hirano A. Inoue Y. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11111-11115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Zhang Z.H. Mayes S.R. Vass I. Nagy L. Barber J. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) null mutants assemble functional PSII and are still capable of photoautotrophy. The more drastic effect seen in theChlamydomonas mutants is consistent with the presence of a more efficient proteolytic system in the chloroplast for the removal of mis-assembled PSII complexes. We have prepared in the course of this work antibodies specific for the PsbE and PsbF proteins of Chlamydomonas, which has allowed for the first time unambiguous examination of the expression of these proteins in other Chlamydomonas PSII mutants. Interestingly, we found that both PsbE and PsbF accumulate to WT levels in FuD7, which cannot synthesize D1 and lacks detectable levels of D2 and CP47 (19Bennoun P. Spierer-Herz M. Erickson J. Girard-Bascou J. Pierre Y. Delsome M. Rochaix J.-D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,35de Vitry C. Olive J. Drapier D. Recouvreur M. Wollman F.-A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 991-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The cytochrome b-559 apopolypeptides therefore appear to be stable in the thylakoid membrane of Chlamydomonas in the absence of many of the PSII subunits but is required for their accumulation. Cyt b-559 is also present at approximately WT levels in a psbA null mutant of Synechocystis6803 (43Nilsson F. Andersson B. Jansson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and a psbE mutant of the same organism that is truncated at the C terminus by 31 residues yet contains only a low level of assembled PSII (44Tae G.-S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4066-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The accumulation of Cyt b-559 in the absence of D1 and D2 is therefore likely to be a common feature among oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Cytochrome b-559 may therefore act as a nucleation factor for assembly of PSII in both cyanobacteria (44Tae G.-S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4066-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and chloroplasts (this work). Indeed, studies on the light-induced development of the chloroplast has indicated that cytochrome b-559, detected spectrophotometrically, accumulates in etioplasts in the absence of the majority of the PSII subunits (45Ohashi K. Murakami A. Tanaka A. Tsuji H. Fujita Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 371-377Google Scholar). We suggest that the level of PSII within the thylakoid membrane may be controlled by the abundance of cyt b-559 and that its redox state, which is controlled by reactions within the thylakoid membrane, may be one of the mechanisms by which the assembly of PSII is regulated. Assembly of PSII may be closely coordinated with D1 synthesis, which is known to be under redox control (46Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In previous work (47Alizadeh S. Barber J. Nixon P. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. I. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 895-898Google Scholar), the stoichiometry of the α and β subunits to the D1 and D2 subunits within the isolated PSII RC from C. reinhardtii, as determined by 14C labeling, was found to be approximately 1:1:1:1 with 1 haem present per PSII RC. This result led to the conclusion that either cyt b-559 was present as a αβ heterodimer or else there was an equimolar mixture of PSII RCs containing either α2 or β2haem-containing complexes (33Alizadeh S. Characterisation of the Photosystem Two Reaction Centre Complex from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Ph.D. Thesis. University of London, 1995Google Scholar, 47Alizadeh S. Barber J. Nixon P. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. I. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 895-898Google Scholar). Because accumulation of β within the thylakoid membrane is dependent on the presence of α (Fig. 3), it is likely that each PSII RC contains both α and β. Hence, the mutagenesis data combined with the isotopic labeling data provide support for the αβ heterodimer model for cyt b-559. Such a conclusion is at odds with the recent finding that an active cytochrome b-559 was synthesized in a strain of Synechocystis 6803 in which the psbE and psbF genes were fused (7McNamara V.P. Sutterwala F.S. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14173-14178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that the natural His ligand present in the psbF gene product at codon 23 has been functional replaced by an alternative ligand within the same subunit. Inspection of the psbF sequence suggests that Met-38 toward the C terminus is a possible candidate. Although replacement of the His ligand by the Met ligand may be expected to destabilize haem binding, the covalent fusion of the α and β subunits may enhance its stability."

The extracellular portion of the protein contains a single immunoglobulin-like domain displaying 46% sequence identity to that of myelin P0, a major structural protein of peripheral myelin. The intracellular segment of the protein shows no significant sequence identity to any known protein except for two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. We name the protein PZR for protein zero related. Transfection of the PZR cDNA in Jurkat cells gave rise to a protein of expected molecular size. Stimulation of cells with pervanadate resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR and a near-stoichiometric association of PZR with SHP-2. Northern blotting analyses revealed that PZR is widely expressed in human tissues and is particularly abundant in heart, placenta, kidney, and pancreas. As a binding protein and a putative substrate of SHP-2, PZR protein may have an important role in cell signaling. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in 293 cells resulted in hyperphosphorylation of a glycoprotein specifically associated with the enzyme.

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)1 represent a highly diverse family of enzymes that have a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation (1Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H.

Nevertheless, in many systems, they have distinct physiological functions. SHP-1 has a negative role in proliferation of hematopoietic cells, whereas SHP-2 is a positive transducer of growth factor signal transduction. This distinction in functions is presumably attributable to different physiological targets. Recently, a number putative substrates of SHP-1 and SHP-2 have been identified (12Xiao S. Rose D.W.

In our earlier studies, by overexpressing catalytically inactive mutants of SHP-1 and SHP-2, we have identified several hyperphosphorylated proteins associated with the inactive SHP-1 and/or SHP-2 (25Zhao Z.

Among these is a 43-kDa membrane protein that is specifically associated with SHP-2. Here we report the purification and molecular cloning of this protein. It represents a novel transmembrane protein with an extracellular segment homologous to myelin protein zero and an intracellular portion containing two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). We name it PZR for protein zero related. Polyclonal anti-SHP-1 and anti-SHP-2 antibodies were raised in rabbits against full-length SHP-1 and an Src homology 2 domain-truncated form of SHP-2, respectively (27Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.-T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Diltz C.D. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2816-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An anti-SHP-2 antibody column was made by immobilization of affinity-purified anti-SHP-2 antibody via NH2 groups to CNBr-activated Sepharose resins (Sigma). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Endoglysosidase F-N-glycosidase F was from Sigma. The stably transfected 293 cells overexpressing the catalytic inactive mutant of SHP-1 or SHP-2 were obtained as previous described (25Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G.

Pervanadate was made by mixing equal moles of sodium vanadate and H2O2 and incubating at room temperature for 20 min before addition to the cells (29Zhao Z. Tan T. Diltz C.D. You M. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22251-22255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The stably transfected 293 cells overexpressing the catalytic inactive mutant of SHP-2 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high containing 10% calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin and 0.25 mg/ml G418 sulfate. After growing to confluency, the cells were treated with 0.1 mm pervanadate for 20 min before harvesting in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The collected cells were broken up with a Dounce glass homogenizer in Buffer A containing 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 10 mm EDTA, 2 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Nuclear pellets were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 20 min, and the remaining postnuclear extract was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to give a clear cytosolic supernatant and a pelleted membrane fraction. The latter pellet, washed once with Buffer A and then dissolved in the same buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, was referred to as the membrane extract. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the clear membrane extract was loaded onto a fast-flow Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer B (25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and the flow through was loaded directly onto a fast-flow SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were then eluted with Buffer B supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl. This was followed by separation of proteins on a wheat germ agglutinin column, which was equilibrated with Buffer B and eluted with 0.3 m N-acetylglucosamine. The eluates were loaded onto an anti-SHP-2 antibody-Sepharose column, which was equilibrated with Buffer B, washed with 0.5 m NaCl, and eluted with 2.0m NaSCN. The final purification step was achieved by using a 7.5% preparative SDS gel (Bio-Rad). Throughout the purification procedure, the proteins were followed by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analyses. The purified protein was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C. Resulting peptide fragments were isolated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a C18 column. Several peptide peaks were chosen for peptide sequence analyses by using a gas phase sequenator at the Vanderbilt Cancer Center. Peptide sequence analyses gave rise to four clean peptide sequences. Search of the expressed sequence tags (EST) database of The Institute for Genomic Research with two of the peptide sequences pulled out an EST that potentially codes for part of a protein. PCR primers were thus designed to amplify the full-length cDNA according to the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) strategy by using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). One RACE primer (AP1) was provided in the kit. Two gene-specific primers were designed according to the EST sequence. They were 5′-TCCGAGGAGCCTGCTTAACTGGTGAC-3′ for 5′ RACE and 5′-GTAGTGGTGGGCATAGTTACTGCTGT-3′ for 3′ RACE. The Advantage KlenTaq polymerase and the Advantage-GC cDNA polymerase, twoTaq polymerase mixtures from CLONTECH, were used for PCR amplification according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and were then sequenced. Combining of the 5′ and 3′ RACE products, which had an overlapping sequence, gave rise to a complete cDNA encoding a protein containing all the four peptides sequenced. To isolate the full-length coding region, two gene-specific primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ coding regions of the cDNA were designed. They were 5′-GATGGCAGCGTCCGCCGGAGCCGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTTTGGTTTTGTTTCTTGCTGAGG-3′. PCR was performed by using the high-fidelity DNA polymerase Pfu and Turbo Pfu (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in addition to the Taq DNA polymerase mixes fromCLONTECH as used above. HeLa cell and human kidney Marathon-ready cDNAs purchased from CLONTECHand 293 cell cDNAs prepared by using the reverse transcription-PCR amplification kit (CLONTECH) were used as templates. The PCR was run for 25 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min. The products obtained with the Pfu enzymes were subcloned into the pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene), which was opened by EcoRV digestion, whereas those obtained with the Taq polymerases were subcloned into pCR2.1 as described above. DNA sequencing was performed by using the automated DNA sequencer at the Vanderbilt Cancer Center. For antibody production, the intracellular portion (corresponding to amino acid residues 192–269) of PZR was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein by using the pGex-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified by using a glutathione-Sepharose column. A rabbit was injected with the fusion protein to produce the antiserum. PZR cDNA encoding the entire coding sequence of the protein was constructed into the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), and the cDNA plasmid was used to transfect Jurkat cells by electroporation. The cells were grown to ∼2 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and penicillin. Cells (1 × 107) were collected by centrifugation, washed with plain medium without serum, and then resuspended in 300 μl of the same plain medium. The cDNA plasmid (20 μg) in 100 μl of water was added to the cells. The electroporation was performed under 950 microfarads, 250 V, and 72 ohms with 4-mm cuvettes by using the ECM 600 electroporation system (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA). After sitting on ice for 15 min, the cells were transferred to 5 ml of complete medium and continued in culture for 72 h before further treatment. To investigate tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR, Jurkat cells transiently overexpressing PZR and wild-type 293 cells were treated with 100 mm pervanadate for 30 min. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed in Buffer A supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were incubated overnight with the anti-PZR antibodies prebound to protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed three times with Buffer A supplemented with 0.3m NaCl. For Western blot analyses, samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with various primary antibodies and were detected by using the ECL system with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the level of expression of PZR in various tissues, a Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot system (CLONTECH) was used as described previously (30Ahmad S. Banville D. Zhao Z. Fischer E.H. Shen S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2197-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the blot was prehybridized for 1 h and then hybridized for 1 h at 68 °C in the ExpressHyb hybridization solution provided in the kit. The probe (PZR fragment) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using the T7 Quick Prime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was washed three times with 2 × SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature and three times with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C before exposure to x-ray film at −80 °C. All PTPs contain a highly conserved cysteinyl residue within their catalytic centers, which is directly involved in the formation of a thiophosphate intermediate essential for the catalysis (for review, see Refs. 1Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar and 2Walton K.M. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Mutation of this cysteinyl residue to serine impairs the phosphatase activity. The Cys-to-Ser mutants of SHP-1 and SHP-2 display dominant negative effects and cause hyperphosphorylation of specific cellular proteins on tyrosine as described previously (25Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-17769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Su L. Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Banville D. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10385-10390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, expression of the catalytically inactive Cys-to-Ser mutant form of SHP-2 resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of 43- and 95-kDa proteins, which were associated with SHP-2, whereas overexpression of the mutant of SHP-1 led to tyrosine phosphorylation of 95- and 110-kDa proteins, which were associated with SHP-1 (Fig. 1 A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins and their association with SHP-1 and/or SHP-2 were also observed in cells (including 293 and HeLa cells) treated with pervanadate, a potent inhibitor of PTPs (data not shown). Because hyperphosphorylation of these proteins correlated with the inactivation of SHP-1 and SHP-2, they are putative substrates of the enzymes. The selective interaction of the 43-kDa protein with SHP-2 suggests its specific role in cell signaling involving SHP-2. In this study, we focus on the purification of the 43-kDa protein (referred to as p43 or PZR hereafter). For purification of p43, 293 cells expressing the catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-2 were treated with 0.1 mmpervanadate for 20 min to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein. After lysis of the cells in Buffer A, p43 was partitioned exclusively in the membrane extract. The protein did not bind to the anionic fast-flow Q-Sepharose column, but this step was necessary for efficient separation of p43 on the next cationic fast-flow SP-Sepharose column, which was eluted with 0.3 m NaCl. In the following step, p43 bound to the wheat germ agglutinin column, and it was eluted with 0.3 m N-acetylglucosamine. This suggests that p43 is a glycoprotein. Because p43 and SHP-2 formed a tight complex, the anti-SHP-2-Sepharose column was able to pull down both proteins. The 95-kDa protein was also found in the complex, but it was less abundant (Fig. 1 A). After purification of the NaSCN eluate of the antibody column on a preparative SDS gel, ∼50 μg of purified p43 was obtained from 300 plates (150 mm) of transfected 293 cells. On SDS gels, purified p43 ran as a broad band at ∼43 kDa, but on deglycosylation by N-glycosidase F, it displayed a sharp band at ∼30 kDa (Fig. 1 B). This further confirms that p43 is a glycosylated protein and indicates that the glycosylation causes heterogenous migration of p43 on SDS gels. To demonstrate specific dephosphorylation of p43 by SHP-2, we incubated purified p43 with equal units of SHP-1 or SHP-2. As shown in Fig. 1 C, SHP-2 caused complete dephosphorylation of p43, whereas SHP-1 only produced a partial dephosphorylation, indicating that p43 may be a physiological substrate of SHP-2. For this purpose, the gel-purified protein was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C. After separation of the peptides on a reverse-phase C18 column, 28 peaks were obtained. Sequencing of peptides corresponding to four of the peaks gave rise to four clean peptide sequences. These, in single-letter amino acid symbols, are peak 15, RDXTGCSTSESLSPVK; peak 17, SLPSGSHQGPVIYAQLDHSGGHHSDK; peak 19, DRISWAGDLDK; and peak 26, NPPDIVVQPGHIRLYVVEK. The X in the sequence of the peak 15 peptide corresponded to a cycle that gave no regular amino acid signal. Sequencing of peptides corresponding to several other peaks yielded mixed peptides. A search of the protein and nucleotide databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information by using the BLAST program revealed that peptides corresponding to peaks 19 and 26 showed significant sequence homology to peptide segments of human peripheral myelin P0. A search of the EST database of The Institute for Genomic Research with peptide sequences from peaks 15 and 17 pulled out an EST with an identification number of THC211134. The EST spans 2892 bp, and it has multiple ambiguous bases. When the EST sequence is inverted, its 5′ end potentially codes for part of a protein that contains the peptide sequences found in peaks 15 and 17. ESTs are partial, single-base sequences from either end of a cDNA clone. The EST strategy was developed to allow rapid identification of expressed genes by sequence analysis. We thus synthesized two specific PCR primers derived from the EST sequence and used them to amplify a RACE-ready HeLa cell cDNA library. The 3′ RACE gave rise to a 521-bp PCR product with a poly(A) tail. The non-poly(A) region essentially verified the EST sequence, which had two uncertain bases in this region. The 5′ RACE yielded a 784-bp PCR product with a GC-rich 5′ region and an initial codon. Combining of the 3′ and 5′ RACE products, which had an overlapping sequence, resulted in a cDNA of 1151 bp. The cDNA contained a 807-bp open reading frame encoding a 269-amino acid protein that contained all the peptides sequenced. To clone the coding region of the cDNA, we synthesized two specific PCR primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ coding regions. For PCR amplification, we used three cDNA libraries (from kidney, HeLa, and 293 cells) and four different thermo-DNA polymerases including two hot-start Taqpolymerase mixtures (CLONTECH) and two high-fidelity Pfu enzymes (Stratagene). All gave rise to an identical PCR product matching that obtained from RACE. This not only confirmed the coding region but also essentially ruled out possible cloning artifacts caused by PCR. The nucleotide sequence of PZR cDNA and the amino acid sequence deduced from it are presented in Fig. 2. The open reading frame consists of 807 nucleotides encoding a protein of 269 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 29,081 Da, which is very close to the size of the deglycosylated protein on the SDS gel (Fig. 1 B). The deduced amino acid sequence contains a signal sequence at the amino terminus, a membrane-spanning segment in the middle, and an 80-amino acid carboxyl-terminal intracellular portion. The primary structure predicts that PZR is a transmembrane protein, which is consistent with our previous observation that p43 co-localized with catalytically inactive SHP-2(C-S) on the plasma membrane (25Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-17769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The 132-bp 5′-untranslated sequence has 75% G+C. There are a G at the +4 position and a purine A at the −3 position from the initiating ATG, which conforms with requirements for efficient translation as defined by Kozak (31Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). The 3′ untranslated region stretches 184 bp before reaching the poly(A) tail. Sequence analysis revealed that the extracellular portion of PZR forms an immunoglobulin-like domain with two cysteinyl residues and two potential N-linked glycosylation sites. It shares 45.8% sequence identity and 60.2% sequence similarity with the extracellular domain of myelin P0 (Fig. 3 A), a major structural protein of peripheral myelin, which is mutated in type 1B Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (32Filbin M.T. Tennekoon G.I. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Harding A.E. Brain. 1995; 118: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The intracellular segment of PZR displayed no significant sequence identity with any known protein except for two ITIMs, which have a (V/I)XYXXX(L/V) consensus sequence (Fig. 3 B). The ITIM was initially defined in FCγRB (34Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and later in many other hematopoietic cell proteins, including KIR (35Colonna M. Samaridis J. Science. 1995; 268: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and LAIR (36Meyaard L. Adema G.J. Chang C. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this motif is also found in SIRP/SHPS-1, a putative SHP-2 substrate that has recently been cloned (23Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 24Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). It should be noted that PZR shares no significant overall sequence identity with SIRP/SHPS-1. The ITIMs corresponding to Tyr241 and Tyr263 of PZR resemble the consensus sequence for binding of SHP-2 Src homology 2 domains, suggesting that Tyr241 and Tyr263 may provide docking sites for the enzyme. Tyr200 corresponding to a peptide sequencing cycle that gave no signal is probably fully phosphorylated in the purified protein. It has an acidic amino acid residue on the amino-terminal side, conferring the consensus phosphorylation sequence for many tyrosine kinases. Because the Src homology 2 domain of SHP-2 requires hydrophobic residues at the third position after the phosphotyrosine, for specific binding (37Lee C.H. Kominos D. Jacques S. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1994; 2: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), Tyr200 is unlikely to serve as a docking site for SHP-2. It may participate in interactions with other proteins and may presumably act as a target of the catalytic domain of SHP-2. In this regard, PZR is a physiological substrate of SHP-2. Above all, the structural features of PZR make it an important player in cell signaling involving SHP-2. Western blot analyses with anti-PZR antibody showed that Jurkat cells express essentially no endogenous PZR. Transfection of the cells with PZR cDNA resulted in expression of PZR with the expected molecular size (Fig. 4 A). The heterogeneous distribution of the protein on the SDS gel can be attributed to the different degrees of glycosylation. To confirm the tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR and its association with SHP-2, the transfected cells were stimulated with pervanadate. As shown in Fig. 4 B, PZR was heavily phosphorylated on tyrosine, and it formed a complex with SHP-2, which itself was phosphorylated on tyrosine. Similar results were observed in wild-type 293 cells treated with pervanadate (Fig. 4 C). In this case, in addition to SHP-2, a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with molecular sizes ranging from 80 to 180 kDa were also co-immunoprecipitated with PZR. In both Jurkat and 293 cells, co-immunoprecipitation of SHP-1 with PZR was not detected, although both cell lines express a high level of SHP-1 (data not shown). We have also treated cells with epidermal growth factor, insulin, and platelet-derived growth factor. However, none of these growth factors could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PZR (data provided for scrutiny by reviewers). This suggests that PZR might be involved in different signaling systems. To characterize further the association of PZR with SHP-2, we performed immunodepletion of PZR and SHP-2. As shown in Fig. 4, D and E, both proteins were totally depleted from cell extracts by correspondent antibodies. In the nonstimulated cells, depletion of one protein had no effect on the presence of the other protein in the cell extracts. In the pervanadate-treated cells, however, depletion of SHP-2 resulted in a >90% loss of PZR in the extracts, whereas depletion of PZR caused ∼50% removal of SHP-2. These data not only reveal a near-stoichiometric association of PZR with SHP-2 but also indicate that PZR may be a major anchor of SHP-2 on the plasma membrane. Northern analyses showed that PZR is expressed in all human tissues investigated (Fig. 5). Expression in heart, placenta, kidney, and pancreas appeared to be particular high. The size of the major transcript from the PZR gene is ∼4.0 kb. Two minor forms of 3.8 and 1.3 kb were also seen. The cDNA obtained from RACE may correspond to the 1.3-kb transcript, which happened to be predominantly amplified in the PCR reaction because of its short length. The 4.0- and 3.8-kb transcripts may result from alternate splicing or an extended 3′ noncoding region. In fact, the EST sequence pulled out from the database spanned 2580 bp after the termination codon. The present study reports purification, molecular cloning, and preliminary characterization of PZR, a binding protein and putative physiological substrate of SHP-2. PZR was purified based on its hyperphosphorylation caused by expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-2 and on its association with the enzyme, and it was cloned according to peptide sequences. PZR is a novel member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Its extracellular segment has significant sequence homology to myelin P0, whereas its intracellular portion has two tyrosine phosphorylation sites resembling ITIMs. Myelin P0 is a major transmembrane glycoprotein in the myelin sheath, and it has strong pathological implications. It has been shown that mutation of myelin P0 is responsible for type 1B Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and homophilic interaction between P0 molecules mediates the apposition of two neighboring membrane layers of myelin (38Shapiro L. Doyle J.P. Hensley P. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 435-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 39Choe S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 363-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). With 60% sequence similarity to myelin P0, PZR might play a similar role in mediating cell-cell interactions in a variety of cells. The ITIM was initially identified in several inhibitory immunoglobulin superfamily members, including human KIR, FcγRII, LAIR, gp49, and gp91 (34Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 35Colonna M. Samaridis J.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In contrast to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs found in proteins associated with cell surface immunoglobulin receptors, T-cell antigen receptors, and certain Fc receptors, ITIMs play an important role in signal inhibition by recruiting terminating enzymes, including protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 and inositol phosphatase SHIP (40Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 41Vely F. Olivero S. Olcese L. Moretta A. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Cambier J.C. Daeron M. Vivier E. Eur.

Res. 1997; 16: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The presence of ITIMs in PZR, which is widely distributed in nonhematopoietic cells, suggests a general importance of these motifs. Our previous studies have shown that hyperphosphorylation of PZR as a consequence of the overexpression of the catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-2 correlated with the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation induced by growth factors (25Zhao Z. Tan T. Wright J.H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.-H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-17769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This suggests that PZR may play a role in down-regulation of growth factor signals. SIRP/SHPS-1, a putative SHP-2 substrate that also contains ITIMs, has been shown to inhibit signaling through tyrosine kinase receptors (23Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect is presumably mediated by ITIMs, which may serve as binding sites for SHP-2. Finally, because PZR specifically interacts with SHP-2 and not SHP-1, it may be responsible for the distinctly different functions of these two enzymes in cell signaling. Considering the crucial role of SHP-2 in cell signaling, as a binding protein and putative physiological substrate, PZR could be an important signaling molecule. We are grateful to Drs. Sanford B. Krantz, Edmond H. Fischer, and Stanley Cohen for critical review of the manuscript."

An F1F0 type ATPase is located in mitochondrial, chloroplast, and bacterial membranes where it catalyzes the terminal step in oxidative- and photo-phosphorylation. InEscherichia coli, the enzyme contains five different subunits in the F1 part, α, β, γ, δ, and ε, in the stoichiometry 3:3:1:1:1, and three different subunits in the F0 part, a, b and c, in the ratio 1:2:9–12. The F1 part contains three catalytic sites on β-subunits and is an ATPase when released from the F0, whereas the F0 part forms a proton pore (1Senior A.E. Physiol.

Recent studies indicate that the b2δ domain forms a second connection, a stator that fixes the α3β3 subdomain to the a-subunit to allow rotation of a γ-ε-c subunit subdomain during energy coupling within the complex (9Wilkens S.

This stator function is consistent with the observed binding of the b-subunits to F1 as a dimer and via the δ-subunit (10Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and with experiments which show that, in the mutant αQ2C, a disulfide cross-link can be formed between α (at Cys-2) and δ at (Cys-140), which is without effect on ATPase, ATP-dependent proton pumping, or ATP synthesis activities (11Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The second stalk has recently been visualized by electron microscopy of single particles (12Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). There are four Cys residues intrinsic to the wild-type α-subunit. Of these, Cys-90 readily forms a disulfide bond with δ in isolated ECF1 (13Ogilvie, I., Wilkens, S., Rodgers, A. J. W., Aggeler, R., and Capaldi, R. A. (1998) Acta Physiol. Scand., in pressGoogle Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase (14Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar), αCys47 and αCys90 are in close proximity, whereas the two remaining Cys residues are buried in the protein. Interestingly, only one αCys90 residue per F1 complex is reactive to labeling withN-ethylmaleimide (15Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), demonstrating an inherent asymmetry of F1. Previous studies have shown that the b-subunit is dimeric for at least a portion of its length proximal to the C terminus (10Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A.

Valiyaveetil F.I. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has not been determined whether dimerization extends to the very C terminus of the protein. Interaction of the b-subunit with F1 has been shown to involve the δ-subunit, specifically its C terminus (10Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), although it is not clear whether the b-subunit interacts with α or β as well. To examine interactions involving the b-subunit more fully, three new mutants were constructed in which Cys replaced Ser-84, Ala-144, and Leu-156 (the C-terminal residue), respectively, and disulfide cross-link formation in ECF1F0 was studied. Upon treatment with CuCl2, b-subunit dimers were formed in the mutant bL156C in competition with cross-linking to an α-subunit. This interaction of the very C terminus of b is shown to involve αCys90. Dimers of subunit b were also formed via Cys residues introduced at positions 84 and 144. These results show that the α-subunit forms part of the binding site on F1 for the second stalk and that the b-subunit extends from the membrane to the N-terminal domain of the α-subunit. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on an M13 mp18 clone containing the unc genes B, E, F, and H on a 2356-base pairHindIII/EcoRI fragment, according to the method of Kunkel et al. (19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Residues bSer84, bAla144, and bLeu156 were replaced by Cys using the following oligonucleotides (sequence changes underlined): AAACGCCGCTGCCAGATTCTG (bS84C), GGATGAAGCTTGTAACAGCGAC (bA144C), and GCTGCTAACTGTGACATCGTG (bL156C). 909-base pairBsrGI/BssHII fragments carrying the mutateduncF genes were excised from the M13 mp18 replicative form and ligated into the vector pRA100 (described in Aggeler et al. (20Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). These plasmids were used to transform theunc − E. coli strain AN888 (21Gibson F. Downie J.A. Cox G.B. Radik J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 728-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and CJ236 (New England Biolabs) were used in cloning and mutagenesis procedures. ECF1F0 was isolated and reconstituted into egg-lecithin vesicles as described in Aggeler et al. (22Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Final resuspension was in 50 mm MOPS,1 pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Cross-linking was carried out at 22 °C for 2 h using concentrations of between 5 μm and 200 μm CuCl2. All cross-linking reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 mm EDTA, and ATPase activities (23Lötscher H.-R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were measured with and without prior incubation of the samples with 20 mm DTT for 2 h at 22 °C. Cross-linking in inner membranes was carried out at 22 °C for 2 h using 400 μm CuCl2. Cross-linking reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 mm EDTA, and ATPase and atebrin fluorescence quenching activities were measured with and without prior incubation of the samples with 50 mm DTT for 2 h at 22 °C. ECF1F0 was prepared as described above and resuspended in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Stripped ECF1F0 was prepared by adding KSCN to a final concentration of 1 m and pelleting the enzyme at 175,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.2 rotor. The pellets were washed twice by successive resuspension and centrifugation steps in 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 40 mm 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid, and 20% glycerol. Stripped vesicles and F1-ATPase dissolved in this buffer were mixed to give final protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml and 3.0 mg/ml, respectively, and incubated at 22 °C for 4 h. The enzyme was pelleted at 175,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.2 rotor and washed twice by successive resuspension and centrifugation steps in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. Atebrin fluorescence quenching activities were assayed as described by Hatch et al. (24Hatch L. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay from Pierce, with bovine serum albumin as standard. F1-ATPase was prepared from membranes of strain AN1460 (25Downie J.A. Langman L. Cox G.B. Yanofsky C. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 8-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described by Wiseet al.

Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Strains used for the preparation of inner membranes and of F1F0-ATPase were grown in minimal medium with supplements (28Gibson F. Cox G.B. Downie J.A. Radik J. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Studies reported here involve three new mutants in which residues Ser-84, Ala-144, and Leu-156 are each replaced by Cys. Previous studies had established that a Cys at position 146 can form cross-links with both the corresponding residue of its b-subunit pair and the δ-subunit (10Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The implication is that the C-terminal region of the b-subunit is involved in binding to the F1. It was of interest therefore to examine a mutant with a Cys at the very C terminus of the b-subunit. Residue 144 lies on the opposite face of a predicted α-helix which is continuous with that formed by a hydrophobic patch (residues 124 to 131). This patch is known to be important for dimer formation (16Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7038-7042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Residue 84 is within a putative β-turn (residues 82–85) that is sensitive to tryptic digestion (10Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and is one of the few regions not predicted to be α-helical. The CuCl2 dependence of cross-linking of reconstituted ECF1F0 from the mutant bL156C is shown in Fig. 1 a. Monomeric subunit b disappeared after incubation with 50 μm CuCl2into two competing products with approximate M r70,000 and 38,000, respectively. Analysis by Western blotting showed that both of these products contained b-subunit and that theM r 70,000 band also contained α-subunit (see Fig. 1 b). Additional evidence that theM r 70,000 band consists of b cross-linked to α was obtained by excising the cross-link product from the gel, incubating the band in loading buffer containing DTT, and then identifying the components by SDS-PAGE in a second dimension (see Fig. 1 c). Previous studies have established that only one of the four Cys residues in the α-subunit can be labeled withN-ethylmaleimide, and this is αCys90 (11Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The other three Cys residues are buried within the protein and are not expected to be available for interaction with the b-subunit. The α-b cross-link, therefore, almost certainly forms between αCys90 and bCys156. TheM r 38,000 band is a dimer of the b-subunit based on antibody binding as well as on molecular weight considerations. Table I lists the effect of cross-linking from the Cys at position 156 on the ATPase activity of the purified enzyme. Essentially full cross-linking of b-subunits into dimers or b-α caused no more than 15% inhibition of activity (Table I).Table IEffect of subunit b mutations on growth and ATPase activitiesMutantGrowth on succinateATPase activity of reconstituted F1F0Inhibition of ATPase activity after maximal cross-linkingμmol/min/mg%bS84C++++23.415bA144C++++27.15bL156C++13.319 Open table in a new tab To establish more directly that Cys-156 of b is interacting with Cys-90 of α, a reconstitution experiment was conducted using F0from the mutant bL156C along with ECF1 isolated from the mutant αC90A. Rebinding of wild-type or mutant F1 to membranes containing F0 from the bL156C mutant reconstituted a functional ECF1F0. Cross-linking of these reassembled enzyme preparations by CuCl2 treatment is shown in Fig. 2. Rebinding of wild-type ECF1 led to cross-links between α and b as well as generation of the b-dimer (Fig. 2, lane 2) as in the experiments in Fig. 1. An α-δ cross-link occurs, migrating just above the α-b product, which is most likely produced in that fraction of ECF1 improperly bound back to the F0-containing membranes (it is not seen in intact ECF1F0; see Ref. 11Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). No α-b cross-linking was observed in ECF1F0 reconstituted to contain the Cys at b156 but with the Cys at α90 absent (Fig. 2, lane 4). However b-dimer was obtained (note that b-dimer is present even in the absence of Cu2+, being formed during the reconstitution procedure). In the reconstituted mutant αC90A/bL156C enzyme, there is internal cross-linking within the δ-subunit, as seen previously, Ref. 11Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Treatment of ECF1F0 from the mutant bA144C with CuCl2 at a concentration as low as 25 μm caused essentially full cross-linking of b-subunit into dimers (see Fig. 3). In the mutant bS84C, a concentration of 150 μm also gave high yields of cross-linking into dimers (result not shown). The essentially complete linkage of b-subunit into dimers at positions 84 or 144 had no major effect on ATPase activity (Table I). Cross-linking in the mutants bA144C and bL156C was examined in E. coli inner membranes so that effects on proton pumping activity could be measured more readily. Dimers of b-subunits were produced in both mutants, which could be detected with the monoclonal antibody to this subunit. Based on the disappearance of monomeric b-subunit, the yield of cross-link in membranes from the mutant bL156C was around 70% in the experiment shown in Fig. 4. However, the intensity of the cross-link products on the blots was not as high as expected for such a yield. This may be because the cross-linking affects the accessibility of the antibody for its epitope. Cross-linking of the mutant bA144C in E. coli inner membranes also gave a greater disappearance of monomeric b-subunit than appearance of dimeric cross-link products (result not shown). The effect of Cu2+-induced cross-linking on ATP-dependent proton pumping by the various mutants is shown in Fig. 5. With the mutants bS84C and bA144C, the effect on proton pumping was minimal (see Figs. 5,a and b). Proton pumping was reduced in bL156C, consistent with the lower growth rate of this strain on succinate (see Table I). Either the mutation itself or a small amount of cross-linking between α and b in the absence of added Cu2+ makes the membranes leaky to protons. Cross-linking by addition of Cu2+ further diminished the function of the mutant bL156C (Fig. 5 c). DTT treatment reversed the cross-linking-induced inhibition, confirming that it was the disulfide bond formation that was affecting function and not the effect of Cu2+ on other membrane components. Proton-translocating activity was not recovered completely on addition of DTT, possibly because of poor accessibility of the reductant to the disulfide bond in the bL156C mutant. We have seen similar variations in accessibility of disulfide bridges to DTT in our previous cross-linking studies. An important new result of the present study is that the b-subunit with a Cys at position 156 forms a cross-link with an α-subunit at αCys90. This Cys lies in the N-terminal domain of the α-subunit, the portion of F1 most distant from the membrane. Therefore, the b-subunits must extend from the bilayer all of the way to the top of ECF1. Previously, we found that a Cys at position 146 of the b-subunit reacts with the δ-subunit (10Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This is additional evidence that b-subunits run the length of the F1F0 because the δ-subunit has itself been shown to lie at the top of the F1 part (11Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 29Lill H. Hensel F. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32737-32742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The accumulated cross-linking data indicate that residues Cys-2 and Cys-90 of the α-subunit, Cys-140 of the δ-subunit, and Cys-156 of the b-subunits must be in close proximity. Presumably, δCys140 and bCys156 are not properly oriented for their interaction. From the x-ray crystal structure, the distance from αCys90 to the bottom of the globular sphere of F1 is approximately 65 Å, whereas electron microscopy reveals the central stalk to be about 45 Å in length (see Ref. 3Gogol E.P. Lücken U. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The b-subunits must therefore extend at least 110 Å from the bilayer. The cytosolic domain of the b-subunit, composed of some 125 residues, is predicted from circular dichroism measurements and structural assessment algorithms to be overwhelmingly α-helical. In all, 80 amino acids would be required to traverse the expected distance in a continuous α-helix. However, the strong prediction of a turn around residues 82–85 implies that a continuous α-helix extending from the membrane to the top of F1 is unlikely. A second important observation is that b-subunit with a Cys at positions 84, 144, or 156 in each case forms a homodimer. Taken together with our previous data and the studies of McLachlin and Dunn (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and Sorgen et al. (30Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. McCormick K.A. Edison A.S. Cain B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the evidence is that the b-subunit is a dimer for its entire length. Mutational analysis by Howitt et al. (16Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7038-7042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) clearly established that residues 124 to 131 are α-helical and form a hydrophobic patch important for dimer formation. This α-helix has been proposed to continue to at least residue 139 (17McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Sorgen et al. (30Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. McCormick K.A. Edison A.S. Cain B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) found that Ala-79 is also critical for dimer formation. In this work, we show that mutants with Cys at both positions 144 and 146 readily form dimers, and cross-linking does not affect ATPase activity or ATP-dependent proton pumping. If this region is α-helical, these residues would fall on opposite faces of the helix. There must therefore be significant flexibility in this portion of the protein that, when limited by cross-linking, does not affect catalysis. The alternative interpretation of the cross-linking data is that the region around residues 144–146 adopts a structure other than α-helix. Higher resolution structural data on the b-subunit than are available now will be needed to decide between these possibilities. Cross-linking of the two b-subunits to one another, of a b-subunit to an α-subunit or of the δ-subunit to an α-subunit (as reported before) does not block cooperative, multisite ATPase activity. This is in contrast to α to β, α to ε, β to ε, α to γ, and β to γ cross-links, all of which block this activity essentially fully (see Ref. 11Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The lack of effect on ATP hydrolysis would be anticipated if the two b-subunits and the δ-subunit together form the second stalk, a stator connecting F1 to the F0. Cross-links through Cys residues introduced at any position up to residue 146 of the b-subunit were found to have little effect on proton pumping. In contrast, cross-linking in the mutant bL156C inhibited proton pumping markedly, an effect reversed by breaking the disulfide bond with DTT. As described already, this mutant forms a cross-link with the α-subunit. It may, therefore, be the b-α cross-link rather than the b-b cross-link that uncouples ATP hydrolysis from proton movements through the F0. The torque generated by rotation of the γ-ε domain within the α3β3hexamer could require compensation by way of conformational flexibility in the connection between the second stalk and F1. Based on the results here, such flexibility would be in interactions at the very C terminus of the b-subunit only, e.g. in its interactions with the α-subunit. Using genetic approaches, Takeyama et al. (31Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16106-16112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also found a critical role for the very C terminus of the b-subunit. Removal of this single residue caused significant reduction of both F1 binding and proton translocation, whereas the loss of two or more residues from the C terminus abolished both activities completely. In summary, we add to the evidence that the b-subunits, along with the δ-subunit, form a second stalk connecting the F1 and F0 parts of the ATP synthase. Cross-linking has been observed between α and b which does not affect ATPase activity but inhibits proton pumping, presumably by disrupting the F1subunit b interface.

Our data indicate that residue 2 of species-selective peptide antagonists such as d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]arginine vasopressin controls their rat versus human selectivity. For species-selective agonists such as desmopressin, residues 1 and 8 modulate the binding selectivity. Among residues different between rat and human V2 receptors, those localized in the upper part of the human V2 receptor have been substituted with their rat V2 homologs. Pharmacological analysis of mutant receptors revealed that residues 202 and 304 fully control the species selectivity of the discriminating antagonists in an independent and additive manner. A third residue (position 100) is necessary to observe an equivalent phenomenon for the discriminating agonists. The substitution of these three residues does not modify the affinity of the nonselective agonists and antagonists. In conclusion, extracellular loops and the top of the transmembrane domains of V2 vasopressin receptors may provide the molecular basis for peptide ligand-binding species selectivity. Very few residues in these regions may control the binding mode of both agonists and antagonists.

The arginine vasopressin (AVP)1/oxytocin receptor family represents a suitable system to investigate structure-function relationships among G protein-coupled receptors. Indeed, all four receptor subtypes for these neurohypophyseal hormones, namely the V1a, V1b, and V2 AVP receptors and the unique oxytocin receptor, have been well characterized by pharmacological and molecular cloning studies (see Ref. 1Barberis C. Tribollet E. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 119-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review). These peptide receptors share a high primary sequence homology, but display a great diversity in their functional properties. Moreover, these receptors interact with many potent selective agonists and several classes of antagonist ligands, such as cyclic and linear peptides (2Manning M. Sawyer W.H. J. Recept. Res. 1993; 13: 195-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as well as nonpeptides (3Serradeil-Legal C. Wagnon J. Garcia C. Lacour C. Guiraudou P. Christophe B. Villanova G. Nisato D.

Invest. 1996; 98: 2729-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). By a combination of receptor three-dimensional molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis approaches, our preceding study has led to the mapping of the AVP agonist-binding domain in the V1a receptor subtype (5Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.-N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol.

The hormone-binding site is localized in a narrow cleft delimited by most of the transmembrane regions ∼15 Å away from the extracellular surface. Because of the high conservation of residues involved in the interaction with the hormone, this binding site has been proposed to be common to the V1b, V2, and oxytocin receptors. An extracellular residue responsible for receptor subtype agonist selectivity has also been identified (6Chini B. Mouillac B. Ala Y. Balestre M.N. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Elands J. Hibert M.

These first analyses did not provide much information on the definition of AVP/oxytocin receptor antagonist-binding domains. To date, only the upper part of transmembrane region VII and a hydrophobic cluster of aromatic residues situated in transmembrane region VI have been shown to be part of the antagonist-binding sites of the oxytocin and V1a receptor subtypes, respectively (9Phalipou S.

The purpose of this work was to increase our knowledge about the antagonist-binding sites of the V2 AVP receptor for a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of this important G protein-coupled receptor (11de Rouffignac C. Corman B. Roinel N. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F156-F164PubMed Google Scholar, 12Morel F. Imbert-Teboul M. Chabardes D. Kidney Int. 1987; 31: 512-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To conduct the study, we have taken advantage of the important differences in peptide antagonist-binding selectivity among mammalian species. Indeed, although many peptide V2 antagonists have been shown to be highly potent in the rat, the two lead candidates were found to be ineffective in humans (13Kinter L.B. Huffman W.F. Stassen F.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F165-F177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings provided the first clear evidence of rat/human species variability of the V2 receptors. Based on previous intensive structure-function activity and analog design of AVP/oxytocin peptide hormones (14Manning M. Stoev S. Chan W.Y. Sawyer W.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 689: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we have used a series of cyclic peptide antagonists displaying species selectivity or not for the rat and human V2 receptors (15Manning M. Cheng L.L. Stoev S. Sawyer W.H. Tribollet E. Barberis C. Wo N.C. Chan W.Y. Saito T. Kurokawa K. Yoshida S. Neurohypophysis: Recent Progress of Vasopressin and Oxytocin Research. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1995: 21-38Google Scholar). These antagonists, such as d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP, highly selective for the rat V2 receptor, all share a closely related structure with AVP and its V2-selective agonist analogs, such as [1-deamino,d-Arg8]arginine vasopressin (dDAVP). Human and rat V2 receptors (16Birnbaumer M. Seibold A. Gilbert S. Ishido M. Barberis C. Antaramian A. Brabet P. Rosenthal W.

Nature. 1992; 357: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) share a very high degree of homology, and sequence identity reaches 88%. Divergent residues may represent potential major determinants responsible for the binding of species-selective AVP antagonists. Taking into account our previous data describing the three-dimensional model of AVP receptors (5Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.-N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25771-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), only residues localized within extracellular loops and at the top of the transmembrane regions have been considered. Those of the human V2 receptor have been subjected to site-directed mutagenesis and substituted for their homologs present in the rat receptor. The pharmacological and functional properties of the mutant V2 receptors were examined. Interestingly, we have demonstrated that binding determinants responsible for species selectivity of peptide antagonists also play an equivalent role in the selective binding of peptide agonists. These results are of broad interest and should contribute to the deciphering of the molecular mechanisms of transduction/inactivation of the V2 receptor and more generally to other G protein-coupled receptors. AVP and dDAVP came from Bachem. DAVP was from Ferring Research Institute. The V2 receptor antagonists d(CH2)5-[d-Tyr(Et)2,Val4,Tyr-NH29]AVP, d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP, d(CH2)5-[d-Tyr(Et)2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP, and d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Val4,Tyr-NH29]AVP were synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. M. Manning. SR 121463A and OPC-31260 came from Sanofi Recherche. [3H]AVP (60–80 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. Extraction of total RNA from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human V2 receptor was performed by homogenization with RNAsolTM reagent (Bioprobe Systems), followed by precipitation with isopropyl alcohol. Total RNA (1.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cDNA (First Strand cDNA Kit for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Boehringer Mannheim). Polymerase chain reaction amplifications of cDNA were carried out with the following sequence-specific primer pair. The upstream primer was 5′-GGAATTCCAGTCCGCACATCACCTCCAG-3′, consisting of an EcoRI restriction site and nucleotides complementary to the 5′-untranslated region from base pairs −50 to −30 of the human V2 receptor gene (16Birnbaumer M. Seibold A. Gilbert S. Ishido M. Barberis C. Antaramian A. Brabet P. Rosenthal W. Nature. 1992; 357: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar); the downstream primer, 5′-CAGGAAGGCAGCTGAGCTTCTCAAAG-3′, was complementary to the 3′-untranslated region from base pairs 30 to 56 after the stop codon. Polymerase chain reaction conditions were 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min, followed by a final 7-min extension step at 72 °C. Agarose gel analysis (1% Sea Kem, FMC Corp. BioProducts) of the polymerase chain reaction products revealed the presence of a single ≈1.2-kilobase pair expected DNA fragment. The cDNA was then subcloned into theEcoRI/XbaI restriction sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV (18Schall T.J. Lewis M. Koller K.J. Lee A. Rice G.C. Wong G.H.W. Gatanaga T. Granger G.A.

The sequence of the human V2 vasopressin receptor cDNA was verified by direct dideoxynucleotide sequencing on both strands (T7sequencingTM kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Point mutations introduced into the human V2 vasopressin receptor cDNA sequence were directly done on the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV with the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were verified again by direct dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The rat V2 receptor cDNA (17Lolait S.J. O'Carroll A.M. McBride O.W. Konig M. Morel A. Brownstein M.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. J.-M. Elalouf. Wild-type and mutant V2 vasopressin receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells by electroporation. Cells (107/0.3 ml) suspended in electroporation buffer were usually incubated with plasmid DNA (20 μg of carrier DNA (expression vector without any insert) and 200 ng of expression vector containing a cDNA insert) for 10 min at room temperature before being pulsed (280 V, 950 microfarads; GeneZapper, Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems). After electroporation, cells were split into six-well clusters or plated on 150-mm Petri dishes depending upon the experiment to be conducted. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection either for cAMP assays or membrane preparations. Binding experiments were performed on COS-7 cell membrane preparations as described previously (5Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.-N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S.

The cyclic peptide antagonists were radioiodinated at position 9 on the tyrosylamide as described previously (19Elands J. Barberis C. Jard S. Tribollet E. Dreifuss J.J. Bankowski K. Manning M.

Membrane preparations (3–12 μg of protein) were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C with increasing concentrations of these radioligands (from 100 to 3000 pm). [3H]AVP was also used as a radioligand; membrane proteins (20–30 μg) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with [3H]AVP at a concentration range of 0.5–30 nm for Scatchard analysis or with 1–2 nm[3H]AVP (a concentration equaling theK d value determined in the saturation experiments) and unlabeled ligands at a concentration range of 10−11 to 10−5m for competition experiments. In each set of experiments, nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 250–1000-fold excess of unlabeled analogs. Bound and free radioactivities were separated by filtration over Whatman GF/C filters presoaked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The ligand binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression using the computer program LIGAND (21Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in triplicate on three separate batches of electroporated cells. Transfected COS-7 cells were grown on six-well clusters. For the last day of culture (48 h after cell electroporation), [3H]adenine (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 2 μCi/ml. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. To evaluate the adenylyl cyclase activity stimulated by AVP or dDAVP, phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose and 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine was added to the wells with or without each agonist at a concentration range of 10−13 to 10−6m. To test the antagonist properties of the d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP compound, the supplemented phosphate-buffered saline with or without the peptide (at a concentration ranging from 10−11 to 10−5m) was added to the wells 15 min before adding 10−9m AVP. After a further 10-min incubation period, the reaction was stopped by replacing the incubation medium with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid. ATP and cAMP were added to the acid extracts at a concentration of 0.5 mm. Relative intracellular cAMP levels were determined by measuring the formation of [3H]cAMP from the prelabeled adenine nucleotide pool. Labeled cAMP was separated by sequential chromatography on Dowex and alumina columns by the method of Salomon et al. (22Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Radioactivity present in the cAMP fractions was expressed as percent of the sum of radioactivity recovered in the cAMP fraction and radioactivity that was not retained by the Dowex column. The latter mainly corresponds to labeled ATP. The data were analyzed by means of nonlinear regression using a sigmoidal dose-response equation (KaleidaGraphTM software). Based on all the preceding vasopressin analog structure-activity studies (see Refs. 14Manning M. Stoev S. Chan W.Y. Sawyer W.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both residues are localized in the cyclic part of the antagonists (Fig. 1). To evaluate the role of only one substitution at a time, four different antagonist compounds were tested: d(CH2)5-[d-Tyr(Et)2,Val4,Tyr-NH29]AVP, d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP, and their hybrid analogs, d(CH2)5-[d-Tyr(Et)2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP and d(CH2)5-[d-Ile 2M.

K d and K i values are reported in Table I (parts A and B, respectively).

All values are the means ± S.E. of three different experiments performed in triplicate. The substitution at position 4 of a valyl residue with an isoleucyl residue, and vice versa, does not influence the affinity and selectivity of the ligand. In contrast, the residue at position 2 plays a critical role in the selectivity. Indeed, with anO-ethyl-d-tyrosyl at this position, the molecule presents a high affinity for both human and rat V2 receptors. This result was observed whatever the nature of residue 4 (valyl or isoleucyl). Moreover, the presence of a d-isoleucyl residue at position 2 is sufficient to confer to the molecule a high selectivity for the rat V2 receptor. In conclusion, only the residue at position 2 determines the species-selective properties of the antagonists. d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP appears to be the most appropriate tool for searching V2 receptor residues involved in the binding selectivity of this cyclic peptide antagonist family. The peptide sequence comparison of rat and human V2 receptor subtypes shows that only 44 residues out of 371 are different (Fig. 2). To choose among the different residues those potentially involved in the selective binding of the cyclic peptide antagonists, we have taken into account our previous results describing three-dimensional models of vasopressin receptors (5Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.-N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol.

Thus, only residues localized in the extracellular loops and at the top of transmembrane regions of the human V2 subtype have been considered. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, these residues were substituted with their homologs present into the rat V2 subtype in order to measure gain in function (Fig. 3). In the first series of experiments, six receptors were constructed with one or several residues mutated at a time to rapidly target the regions possibly involved in the binding selectivity. For each mutant receptor transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, the affinity for [3H]AVP was determined by Scatchard analysis (Table II);K d values for AVP were equivalent to those of the wild-type human V2 receptor (K d = 1.48 ± 0.08 nm). Furthermore, no change in theB max values was observed with respect to the wild-type human V2 receptor (B max ≈ 2–4 pmol/mg of protein), indicating a comparable level of expression of the different mutant receptors.Figure 3Targeting the residues potentially involved in the receptor selectivity for the cyclic peptide antagonists.The primary sequence and the possible transmembrane topology of the human V2 receptor are shown. Nonconserved residues between rat and human V2 receptors are highlighted in black. Residues selected for the site-directed mutagenesis are labeled according to their peptide sequence number.

The affinities of AVP, d(CH2)5-[d-Tyr(Et)2,Val4,Tyr-NH29]AVP, and d(CH2)5-[d-Tyr(Et)2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP for these mutants were directly determined in saturation experiments.

All values are the means ± S.E. The number of independent determinations is given in parentheses. The affinity of the rat V2 receptor-selective antagonists (d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP and d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Val4,Tyr-NH29]AVP) was measured in competition binding assays by displacement of [3H]AVP (Table II). Only mutant human V2 receptors R202L,T204A and G304R,A305P displayed a gain in affinity for these ligands (K i = 18.8 ± 1.8 and 29.3 ± 2 nm for the d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP compound, respectively), whereas the K i value for the wild-type human V2 receptor was higher (128 ± 6 nm). To precisely determine the residues responsible for selective binding, a second series of single-point mutant receptors (R202L, T204A, G304R, or A305P) was studied (Table II). The restoration of high affinity binding observed for both R202L,T204A and G304R,A305P mutant receptors was exclusively due to the substitution of residue 202 in the second extracellular loop and of residue 304 in transmembrane domain VII. Each single mutation (R202L or G304R) equally influenced the binding selectivity for the antagonists possessing ad-isoleucyl residue at position 2, whatever the residue present at position 4 (valyl or isoleucyl). Indeed, an equivalent gain in affinity was observed: 7.0–7.4-fold with the d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP ligand and 5.3–5.9-fold with the d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Val4,Tyr-NH29]AVP analog. Finally, for a mutant receptor combining both substitutions (R202L and G304R), we observed that the pharmacological properties toward the cyclic peptide antagonists were totally switched to those of the rat V2 receptor. Indeed, as for the wild-type rat V2 receptor, the affinity of the four antagonists could be directly determined by Scatchard analysis using their radioiodinated analogs (Table II). For instance, theK d values for the d(CH2)5-[d-Ile2,Ile4,Tyr-NH29]AVP compound were 0.32 ± 0.05 and 0.47 ± 0.03 nmfor the wild-type rat V2 and the mutant human R202L,G304R V2 receptors, respectively. In conclusion, residue 202 in the second extracellular loop and residue 304 at the top of transmembrane domain VII of V2 vasopressin receptors have additive effects and fully control the selectivity of V2 receptors versus cyclic peptide antagonists with d-Ile at position 2. We then looked at the possible implication of residues 202 and 304 in the selective binding of cyclic peptide agonists. DAVP and dDAVP, two slightly modified analogs of AVP (Fig. 1), display species selectivity for the rat versus human V2 receptors (Table III). These findings indicate that replacement of l-Arg at position 8 with d-Arg is sufficient to provide selectivity to these molecules. The affinity of these two compounds has been measured on the R202L,G304R mutant V2 receptor (Table III). Our results show that substitution of both residues led to a gain in affinity for each agonist: 7.4- and 4-fold for dDAVP and DAVP, respectively. To evaluate the influence of each substitution on the binding selectivity, both agonists were tested on single-point mutant receptors (R202L and G304R). The calculated affinity values indicated that each single mutation induced an equivalent gain in affinity: 4.6–5.3-fold with dDAVP and 1.4–1.9-fold with DAVP. However, for both peptide agonists, a total restoration of the high affinity observed on the rat V2 receptor (K i"

Intact yeast cells lacking RMT1, the gene encoding the protein ω-N G-arginine methyltransferase, were labeled with the methyl donorS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine. The protein fraction was acid-hydrolyzed to free amino acids, which were then fractionated on a high resolution sulfonated polystyrene cation exchange column at pH 5.27 and 55 °C. In the absence of the ω-N G ,N G-[3H]dimethylarginine product of the RMT1 methyltransferase, we were able to detect a previously obscured 3H-methylated species that migrated in the region of methylated arginine derivatives. The [3H]methyl group(s) of this unknown species were not volatilized by treatment with 2 m NaOH at 55 °C for up to 48 h, suggesting that they were not modifications of the terminal ω-guanidino nitrogen atoms.

The activity of many proteins is modulated by the covalent posttranslational modification of specific amino acid residues. Some of these modification reactions, such as phosphorylation, are reversible whereas others appear to permanently modify residues effectively enlarging the repertoire of amino acids available to proteins. A major group of the latter reactions involves S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)1-dependent methylation of the side chain nitrogen atoms of histidine, lysine, and arginine residues (1Paik W.K. Kim S.

There are at least three distinct types of protein arginineN-methyltransferases that have been classified by their reaction products. The type I enzymes catalyze the formation of ω-N G-monomethylarginine and asymmetric ω-N G,N G-dimethylarginine residues, the type II enzymes catalyze the formation of ω-N G-monomethylarginine and symmetric ω-N G,N′ G-dimethylarginine residues, whereas the type III enzyme forms only the ω-N G-monomethylarginine derivative (for a review, see Ref. 11Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise functional role of these methylated arginine residues has not been established. We have been interested in studying the modification of yeast proteins by methylation. The complete genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been sequenced (12Goffeau A. et al.Nature. 1997; 387 suppl.: 1-105Google Scholar), and the presence of methyltransferase sequence motifs in many of these enzymes aids in the identification of new modification enzymes (13Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Yeast cells, in contrast to almost all other cell types, actively import the biological methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (14Murphy J.T. Spence K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 499-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this allows radiolabeling of proteins in intact cells under in vivoconditions to determine the relevant substrates. Finally, yeast knockout mutants can be readily constructed and can be useful in the pairing of specific methyltransferase genes with their substrates. We recently identified the gene responsible for the majority of protein arginine methylation in yeast (5Gary J.D. Lin W-J. Yang M.C. Herschmann H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This gene, RMT1, encodes a type I protein arginine methyltransferase capable of sequentially methylating arginine residues to ω-N G-monomethylarginine and ω-N G ,N G-dimethylarginine in a variety of proteins (5Gary J.D.

Mutants lacking this enzyme appear to be completely deficient in the formation of ω-N G ,N G-dimethylarginine residues, suggesting that this enzyme is wholly responsible for this modification. However, these mutants contain residual ω-N G-monomethylarginine residues as well as an additional unknown methylated residue that chromatographs between the positions of the dimethyl- and monomethylarginine derivatives (5Gary J.D.

In this paper, we provide evidence that this latter methylated residue represents a novel modification of arginine residues giving rise to δ-N-monomethylarginine through the methylation of the internal (or δ) guanidino nitrogen atom and suggest that a new type of protein arginine methyltransferase exists in nature.

Cells from a 6-ml culture were harvested at 1000 × g for 3 min in a 15-ml polystyrene centrifuge tube at room temperature. Cells were washed 3 times with 1 ml of YPD medium and resuspended in 0.82 ml of YPD medium. The suspension was transferred to a 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tube and mixed with 0.18 ml of [3H]AdoMet (Amersham Life Science, 79 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml in dilute HCl (pH 2.0–2.5):ethanol (9:1, v/v) (final concentration of 1.4 μm) and incubated while shaking at 30 °C for 30 min. Cells were then pelleted at 13,600 × g at room temperature for 1 min, washed twice with 1 ml of water, and used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Isotopically labeled cells were resuspended in 50 μl of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (w/v) and 0.67 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Acid-washed glass beads (0.5 mm diameter, Biospec Products) were then added (0.2 g) to the cell suspension, and the tube was vortexed for 1 min followed by an incubation on ice for 1 min. This cycle was repeated 7 times. Approximately 40 μl of this extract was removed with a micropipette tip and placed into a new tube. The beads were washed with an additional 50 μl of the lysis solution and combined with the cell lysate. Aliquots (30 μl) of the cell lysate were mixed with an equal volume of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in a 6 × 50-mm glass vial and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The precipitated material was pelleted at 4000 × g for 40 min at 25 °C. The pellets were washed once with acetone (100 μl) at −20 °C, dried, and then acid-hydrolyzed in the presence of 200 μl of 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 20 h in a Waters Pico-Tag vapor-phase apparatus. The hydrolyzed samples were resuspended in 200 μl of water for analysis by cation exchange chromatography. δ-N-Methylornithine was synthesized after the general reductive methylation strategy described by Benoiton (15Benoiton L. Can. J. Chem. 1964; 42: 2043-2047Crossref Google Scholar). α-N-Acetyl-l-ornithine (29 μmol, Sigma) was dissolved in 280 μl of 1 m NaOH in a 12 × 75-mm borosilicate test tube. A molar equivalent of formaldehyde (2.5 μl of 37% (w/w), Fisher) was then added. The reaction proceeded at room temperature, and the solution was mixed periodically over a 20-min period. N-Acetylation of the α-nitrogen atom of the substrate ensured that only the δ-nitrogen atom of ornithine would be modified. Four molar equivalents (116 μmol; 116 μl) of freshly prepared NaBH4 dissolved in 1 m NaOH were added to the mixture, vortexed, and incubated at 15 °C for 1 h with periodic mixing. Approximately 150 μl of 6 n HCl was added dropwise to the mixture until the pH of the solution was less than 2. Aliquots (100 μl) were placed into 6 × 50-mm glass vials and dried under vacuum at room temperature using a Speed Vac (Savant). The sample was then acid-hydrolyzed to remove the α-N-acetyl protection group, as described above. The material in each tube was dissolved in 50 μl of water and then combined and stored at −20 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography at room temperature on a 20-cm sheet coated with a 0.2-mm layer of silica 60 (EM Separations, Gibbstown, NJ, no. 5748) with a mobile phase consisting of CH3OH:∼14.8 n NH4OH (3:1, v/v). After heating the sheet at 105 °C in a vacuum oven for 5 min to evaporate the solvents, it was sprayed with ninhydrin (10 mg/ml in acetone) and incubated at 55 °C. Three ninhydrin-positive spots were detected at RF values of 0.37, 0.42, and 0.63. The areas corresponding to these spots on an adjacent lane were scraped into a microcentrifuge tube and submitted to the UCLA Center for Molecular and Medical Sciences Mass Spectroscopy for electrospray analysis. The samples in each tube were dissolved in 400 μl of H2O:CH3CN (50:50, v/v) and centrifuged momentarily to pellet silica debris. An aliquot (20 μl) was mixed with 10 μl of H2O:CH3CN:HCOOH (50:50:0.1, v/v) and scanned in positive ion mode from 120 to 220m/z. We found that the compound migrating atRF = 0.42 had a mass of 133 corresponding to ornithine, the RF = 0.37 compound with a mass of 147 corresponds to δ-N-monomethylornithine, and theRF = 0.63 compound with a mass of 161 corresponds to δ-N,N-dimethylornithine. The reaction products were purified on a preparative basis using the cation exchange column described above. Two ninhydrin-positive peaks were detected at 43–47 min and 50–55 min that were identified by thin layer chromatography as ornithine and as a mixture of δ-N-monomethylornithine and δ-N,N-dimethylornithine, respectively. To separate the mono- from the dimethylornithine species, the 50–55-min peak was pooled, and 1 ml was injected onto a reverse phase HPLC column (Econosphere C18 5 μm column from Alltech, 4.6 mm by 250 mm) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at room temperature. One-min fractions were dried under vacuum, and pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of water and analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described above. δ-N-Monomethylornithine was found to elute within the first 8 min whereas the bulk of δ-N,N-dimethylornithine elutes between 8 and 11 min. We also performed this synthesis with [3H]NaBH4 to obtain radiolabeled methyl derivatives. The same procedure was used except 4.4 μmol of sodium [methyl-3H]borohydride (NEN Life Science Products, 222 mCi/mmol dissolved in 1 m NaOH, pH 9) was used with 4.4 μmol of NaBH4. Thin layer chromatography showed radioactivity in species at RF = 0.33 and RF = 0.60 corresponding to δ-N-monomethylornithine and δ-N,N-dimethylornithine, respectively. When protein arginine methylation was characterized in a yeastrmt1 mutant deficient in ω-N G ,N G-dimethylarginine formation, a peak of residual [3H]methyl radioactivity was found to elute just after the expected position of ω-N G ,N G-dimethylarginine (5Gary J.D.

We have now investigated whether this material might represent a new type of methylated arginine derivative. Intact yeast cells were incubated with the isotopically labeled biological methyl donorS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine. Following disruption of the cells, acid hydrolysates of the protein fraction were applied to a high resolution amino acid analysis cation exchange column along with standards of ω-N G-monomethylarginine and ω-N G ,N G-dimethylarginine (Fig. 1). Although the bulk of radioactivity was found in species eluting prior to the methylated arginine derivatives, a well defined peak of 3H radioactivity consistently eluted between the two standards in a position similar to that of the symmetric ω-N G ,N′ G-dimethylarginine derivative. A diagnostic test for arginine derivatives is their lability to base treatment. Breakdown products of arginine in base include ornithine, citrulline, urea, carbon dioxide, and ammonia (16Greenstein J.P. Winitz M. Chemistry of the Amino Acids. II. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1961: 1612Google Scholar). Arginine residues methylated at the terminal (ω) nitrogen atoms have been shown to yield methylamine and methylurea (17Paik W.K. Kim S.

When the unknown derivative eluting at 86–88 min (Fig. 1) was subjected to base treatment, however, we recovered very little volatile radioactivity (Table I), suggesting that it did not represent any of the known ω-N G-methylated forms of arginine.Table IBase-dependent volatility of methyl arginine derivatives3H-Methylated amino acidVolatility1 m NaOH (24 h)1m NaOH (48 h)2 m NaOH (24 h)%ω-N G,N G-Dimethylarginine44.953.399.3ω-N G-Monomethylarginine21.628.047.7Novel derivative7.48.310.3Pooled fractions from the cation exchange column representing ω-N G,N G-[methyl-3H]dimethylarginine, ω-N G-[methyl-3H]monomethylarginine, and the novel 3H-methylated peak were analyzed for volatile radiolabeled products after base treatment.

We then considered the possibility that the derivative represented an arginine species methylated on the internal imino nitrogen atom of the guanidino group (i.e. δ-N-methylarginine) (Fig. 2). Consistent with the results from Table I, base treatment of such a species would produce the non-volatile methylated product δ-N-methylornithine (17Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2108-2114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 88-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nakajima T. Matsuoka Y.

We therefore synthesized a standard of δ-N-methylornithine (see “Experimental Procedures”) for comparison with the base-treated product of the unknown3H-methylated species. A fraction of the unknown3H-methylated peak from the cation exchange column in Fig. 1 was mixed with NaOH to a final concentration of 2 m NaOH and incubated at 55 °C for 24 h, as described in Fig. 3. Rather than analyze the volatile radioactivity as in Table I, the base-treated sample was rerun on the cation exchange column and compared with standards to analyze the nonvolatile radioactivity. We found that the radioactivity in the original unknown 3H-methylated peak at 85–91 min disappeared and was quantitatively transferred to a new peak of radioactivity in the 43–47-min region (Fig. 3 C). This radioactive peak exactly co-eluted with the synthetic δ-N-methylornithine added as an internal standard (Fig. 3 C). As controls, the unknown 3H-methylated peak was stable when rerun on the cation exchange column without heat or base treatment (Fig. 3 A) or when incubated at 55 °C for 24 h without base (Fig. 3 B). These studies indicate that the formation of the new 3H-methylated product co-eluting with δ-N-methylornithine is dependent upon base treatment.Figure 3Base treatment of the novel methylated amino acid derivative produces a species that co-chromatographs with δ-N-methylornithine. Fractions 86–88 encompassing the unknown peak eluting just after the ω-N G ,N G-dimethylarginine standard peak on the cation exchange column from Fig. 1 were pooled.A, an aliquot of the pool (800 μl) was rechromatographed as shown in Fig. 1. B, an aliquot of the pool (800 μl) was incubated for 24 h at 55 °C and rechromatographed as above.C, an aliquot (800 μl) of the pool was mixed with 10m NaOH to give a final concentration of 2 mNaOH. The mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 24 h and mixed with 200 μl of 12 n HCl, and 40 μl (∼150 nmol) of HPLC-purified δ-N-methylornithine was added. The reaction mixture was then diluted with 17 ml of water and rechromatographed as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the identification of δ-N-[methyl-3H]ornithine, fractions forming the 3H-methylated peak at 45–49 min in Fig. 3 C were pooled, and 1 ml was directly injected onto a reverse phase HPLC column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The radioactivity representing the base-treated3H-methylated unknown peak eluted from the HPLC column in a flow-through peak with the salt and in a distinct peak at 8 min (data not shown). This latter material was dried and subjected to thin layer chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that radioactivity from the base-treated3H-methylated species exactly co-eluted with the δ-N-monomethylornithine standard (Fig. 4). These results provide strong evidence that the product of the base treatment is δ-N-[3H]monomethylornithine and that [methyl-3H]-δ-N-monomethylarginine is present in the hydrolysate of the rmt1 yeast cytosol. The initial studies of methylated arginine derivatives in proteins focused on the characterization of mono- and dimethylated arginine residues in bovine and rat tissues (17Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2108-2114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 88-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nakajima T. Matsuoka Y.

In fact, Paik and Kim (18Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 88-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) specifically ruled out the existence of δ-N-methylarginine in hydrolysates of rat liver nuclei when they found that alkaline treatment of guanidino-[methyl-14C]arginine derivatives yielded radiolabeled methylurea and methylamine; no radioactive product co-chromatographed with a synthetic δ-N-methylornithine standard. Nakajima et al. (19Nakajima T. Matsuoka Y. Kakimoto Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 230: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) concurred with this result in similar experiments using hydrolysates of proteins from bovine brain and various rat organs. There appear to be no further studies of the possible existence of δ-N-methylarginine residues in proteins since these reports were published. In light of our discovery of these residues in yeast proteins, it might now be of interest to ask whether δ-methylarginine residues are indeed present in mammalian cell proteins but at levels where they are obscured by the much more prevalent ω-methylarginine derivatives. The physiological function served by the methylation of arginine residues at the δ-nitrogen atom is unknown. However, it is clear that such methylation would effectively disrupt the ability of arginine to hydrogen bond at this atom (24Borders Jr., C.L. Broadwater J.A. Bekeny P.A. Salmon J.E. Lee A.S. Eldridge A.M. Pett V.B. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 25Shimoni L. Glusker J.P. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and may thus allow for more specific hydrogen bonding patterns involving the unmethylated ω-nitrogen atoms of the same residue. The determination of the polypeptide(s) in yeast cells that contain δ-N-methylarginine residues, as well as the identification of the enzyme(s) that catalyze its synthesis, will be important steps in understanding the role of this modification. Although there have been no previous reports of the presence of δ-N-methylarginine residues in proteins, there is a report in the literature on the existence of the free amino acid in the root tuber of snake gourd (Trichosanthes cucumeroides) (26Inukai F. Suyama Y. Inatome H. Morita Y. Ozawa M. Annual Meeting of the Agricultural Chemical Society of Japan, Nagoya, April 1968. Agricultural Chemical Society of Japan, Nagoya, Japan1968: 183Google Scholar). Additionally, free δ-N-methylornithine, the base-generated product of δ-N-methylarginine, has been suggested to occur in bovine brain by chromatographic analysis of tissue extracts (21Matsuoka Y. Kumon A. Nakajima T. Kakimoto Y. Sano I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 192: 136-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, δ-N-methylornithine appears to be a biosynthetic precursor of nicotine in tobacco plants (27Gilbertson T.J. Leete E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 7085-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The results presented here open the possibility that these free amino acids may originate from the proteolytic hydrolysis and degradation of proteins containing δ-N-methylarginine. In light of the inhibitory properties of ω-N-methylarginine derivatives on nitric oxide synthase (28Tojo A. Welch W.J. Bremer V. Kimoto M. Kimura K. Omata M. Ogawa T. Vallance P. Wilcox C.S. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1593-1601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to ask if δ-N-methylarginine has similar effects that may be of physiological relevance in mammals. Finally, we should point out that there is precedence for the enzymatic methylation of the imino δ-nitrogen atom in a small molecule arginine derivative rather than in protein as seen here. A well characterized methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.2) converts guanidinoacetate to creatine, its δ-N-methyl derivative, in the biosynthetic pathway leading to creatine phosphate in vertebrate and echinoderm cells (29Ellington W.R. Roux K. Pineda Jr., A.O. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).

We here investigated the inhibitory effects of the chaperone cofactors Hop/p60 and Hap46.

By contrast, Hap46 was not coprecipitated. Binding of Hop/p60 to CCT is dependent on the presence of ATP or ADP and occurs through carboxyl-terminal sequences of Hop/p60.

We used denatured firefly luciferase as a model protein and found decreased binding to CCT in the presence of Hop/p60 and ATP. This coincides with the inhibitory effect of Hop/p60 on luciferase reactivation in an assay using purified CCT in combination with hsc70 and hsp40.

To be functionally active, proteins must attain and maintain their native conformations. In many instances, such functionally correct 3-dimensional folding occurs spontaneously upon polypeptide synthesis or subsequent to denaturation of preexisting structures. Alternatively, folding may be aided by so-called chaperones and chaperonins which in recent years have attracted growing research interests (for reviews, see Refs. 1Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem.

One of the major functions of molecular chaperones, in particular of members of both the 70-kDa and 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp)1 families, is to keep misfolded proteins from forming insoluble aggregates through interactions between exposed hydrophobic areas. In the case of the chaperonin GroEL/GroES of eubacteria and the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 complex (CCT) of eukaryotes, nonnative proteins are individually encaged within barrel-like cavities where they may attain their properly folded state. In contrast to the above mentioned heat shock proteins which are mostly monomers (hsp70) or homodimers (hsp90), chaperonins are multimeric complexes of subunits of ∼60 kDa. These are arranged in stacks of two rings each consisting of 7 or 8 subunits in eubacteria and eukaryotes, respectively. The hsp70 family of eukaryotic chaperones comprises stress-inducible members as hsp70 itself and the constitutively expressed form hsc70. They have a conserved structure consisting of the amino-terminal ATP-binding portion and the carboxyl-terminal domain which binds misfolded substrate. Recently, several structurally unrelated proteins have been identified that associate with hsp70 and hsc70 as cofactors and affect chaperoning activities. Although the “hsp70/hsc70-associating protein” Hap46 of roughly 46 kDa has originally been detected in association with steroid hormone receptors (6Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it was found to directly interact with the amino-terminal ATP-binding domain of hsp70 and hsc70 (7Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar); it is also known as BAG-1 (8Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 9Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Similarly, the “hsc70-interacting protein” Hip/p48 (48 kDa) (10Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 11Prapapanich V. Chen S. Nair S.C. Rimerman R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 420-431PubMed Google Scholar) associates with the ATP-binding domain (10Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Hap46 and Hip/p48 compete for binding to hsc70 (9Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A third factor is the “hsp70/hsp90-organizing protein” Hop/p60 of molecular mass 60–66 kDa (13Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honoré B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it is unique in that it binds to both hsp70 and hsp90 chaperones. Interaction occurs with the carboxyl-terminal domain of hsp70/hsc70; however, binding is distinct from that of misfolded protein substrates (12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Demand J. Lüders J. Höhfeld J. Mol. Cell.

Even though Hap46 and Hop/p60 interact with different domains of hsp70/hsc70, there appears to be some interference. Hap46 inhibits the binding of Hop/p60 to hsc70, probably by steric hindrance (15Gebauer, M., Zeiner, M., and Gehring, U. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol.in pressGoogle Scholar). In previous studies, we used a standard protein-refolding system (16Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) with thermally denatured firefly luciferase as a model for heat-damaged proteins. We observed that the hsp70/hsc70 accessory proteins Hap46 and Hop/p60 significantly inhibited refolding if used in concentrations roughly equimolar to hsc70 (12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This folding system is rather complex in that it not only depends on hsc70 and the cochaperone hsp40 but also requires small amounts of rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The latter is known to contain the chaperonin CCT (17Nimmesgern E. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Melki R. Batelier G. Soulié S. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and may contain additional factors that could possibly contribute to the effects observed with this crude system. We now demonstrate by use of a neutralizing antibody that CCT is an essential component of this refolding system. In the present study, we also used authentic CCT purified from reticulocytes and investigated the effects of the above hsp70/hsc70 cofactors. In this system of pure components, we again observed inhibition of luciferase reactivation by Hap46 and Hop/p60. Most strikingly, we detected a direct molecular interaction between CCT and Hop/p60. CCT was purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate as before (18Melki R. Batelier G. Soulié S. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and hsc70 from bovine brain (19Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed His-tagged human hsp40 and human Hop/p60 as well as GST-Hap46 were as before (7Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For obtaining the amino-terminal deletion (residues 1–62) of Hap46 the cDNA (6Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was digested with BstEII and EcoRI. The fragment encoding residues 63–274 was filled-in with Klenow fragment to produce blunt ends (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.-G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York.1995Google Scholar) and ligated in frame into the filled-in EcoRI site of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) to generate the amino-terminal GST fusion protein. These GST fusion proteins contain thrombin cleavage sites that can be used to produce untagged versions of Hap46 and Hap46(63–274) by proteolysis (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.-G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York.1995Google Scholar) with bovine thrombin (Boehringer Mannheim). To obtain amino-terminally His-tagged versions of Hop/p60 deletions, we used plasmid pET-28a-Hop (12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that was cut either with NcoI or with BglI and XhoI. Fragments containing codons 1–448 and 116–543 were filled in and cloned into SmaI sites of pQE-30 or pQE-31 (Qiagen), respectively, resulting in pQE-30-Hop(1–448) and pQE-31-Hop(116–543). Expression of proteins was in Escherichia coli strains JM109 and BL21(DE3), and purifications were carried out as before (6Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Bovine brain hsp90 was from Sigma and [γ-33P]ATP (10 μCi/μl, 3000 Ci/mmol) from ICN. Firefly luciferase (1 μg, Sigma) was thermally denatured for 10 min at 42 °C in the presence of hsc70 and hsp40. Reactivation in the presence of 5% rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) was as before (7Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) but dithiothreitol was omitted. For refolding in the presence of pure components, luciferase (1 μg) was thermally denatured as above in the presence of hsc70 (2 μg), hsp40 (2 μg), and accessory proteins (4 μg each), as indicated, in buffer A (25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2), 75 mmKCl, and 4 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm ATP and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol; total volume, 20 μl. Purified CCT (25 μg) was then added, and incubation was for 90 min at 30 °C. Enzyme activities were determined with the Promega luciferase assay. CCT-specific immunoprecipitations were by standard procedures (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.-G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York.1995Google Scholar) using 5 μg of antibody 91a (Stressgen) in buffer A containing routinely 1 mm ATP. Incubation was at 4 °C for 1 h in a total volume of 150 μl and subsequently overnight with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). Retained proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U.

Detection was by antiserum C-16 (Santa Cruz) against Hap46 (BAG-1) and E4191 (Promega) against firefly luciferase as well as monoclonal antibodies F5 (Stressgen) against Hop/p60, N27F3-4 (Stressgen) against hsp70/hsc70, MRGSHis (Qiagen) against amino-terminally His-tagged polypeptides, and 91a against the CCT α-subunit. Staining was with peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies and chemiluminescence (Amersham). ATP binding assays were in buffer A containing 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. Following incubations, free nucleotides were removed by centrifugation through MicroSpin G-50 columns (Pharmacia). Protein bound [33P]ATP was analyzed as described (21Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) by chromatography on polyethylenimine cellulose (Merck). ATP spots were identified by autoradiography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. For ATPase assays, purified CCT (6 μg) was incubated with [γ-33P]ATP (1 μl) and accessory proteins (4 μg each) in a total volume of 20 μl of buffer A containing 2.5 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min at 30 °C. After cooling on ice, 2 μl of each sample were chromatographed on polyethylenimine cellulose. Released labeled phosphate was quantified as described above. Recombinant Hap46, Hop/p60, and deletion variants thereof were preincubated with ATP-agarose (Sigma) to remove possible contaminating ATPases of bacterial origin. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing Hop/p60 were used. Extracts containing GroEL and Hop/p60 (25–50 μg each) were chromatographed over ATP-agarose as affinity matrix according to a published procedure (22Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). After extensive washing with saline, eluates with 5 mm ATP were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antiserum G-6532 (Sigma) against GroEL and antibody F5 against Hop/p60. The protein-folding system that we previously used requires small amounts of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (7Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To ascertain that the positive effect of crude lysate on refolding of thermally inactivated luciferase is due to CCT, we used monoclonal antibody 91a directed against α-subunits of CCT (23Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K. Nature. 1992; 358: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Indeed, this antibody was able to completely inhibit enzyme reactivation. As shown in Fig. 1, increasing amounts of antibody added to the folding reaction progressively interfered with reactivation. This result provides clear evidence for the participation of CCT in this refolding system. Binding of antibody 91a to α-subunits may inhibit the function of CCT by sterically fixing these α-subunits within the double-ring structure of CCT. We then studied protein folding using a combination of pure components, most notably CCT in conjunction with hsc70 and hsp40. This represents the eukaryotic counterpart to the bacterial system of GroEL together with DnaK and DnaJ which has successfully been used in in vitro folding reactions (24Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) and is known to prevent protein aggregation in vivo (25Gragerov A. Nudler E. Komissarova N. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Nikiforov V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10341-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In our system, luciferase reactivation was found to depend on CCT and hsc70 (Fig. 2 A, Columns 6 and 7 versus Column 1) as well as hsp40 and ATP (not shown). We found that the folding activity steadily increased with the concentration of CCT and reached a level of roughly 30% luciferase reactivation under our experimental conditions. This is almost as efficient as the above refolding system using diluted, crude reticulocyte lysate in which we routinely obtained ∼40% enzyme reactivation (7Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). More importantly, the accessory proteins Hap46 and Hop/p60 similarly inhibited reactivation (Fig. 2 A, Columns 2and 4) while GST used as control protein was inert (Column 1). Control experiments showed that inhibition is just as prevalent whether GST-Hap46 or Hap46 itself is used (data not shown). The amino-terminal truncation Hap46(63–274) that retains the region required for hsp70 binding (8Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) similarly inhibited refolding (Column 3). Interestingly, addition of Hap46 and Hop/p60 together resulted in inhibition of refolding in this system of pure components (Fig. 2 A, Column 5). The data of Fig. 2 B show that the inhibitory effects of Hap46 and Hop/p60 are concentration dependent. Efficient inhibition was attained at about 1 μm concentrations. This corresponds to roughly the concentration of hsc70 and CCT in these assays (1.4 and 1.3 μm, respectively). Although Hop/p60 directly interacts with hsp70s, it affects neither its nucleotide- nor substrate-binding activities (15Gebauer, M., Zeiner, M., and Gehring, U. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol.in pressGoogle Scholar,26Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This is clearly in contrast to Hap46 which, however, binds to a different domain of hsp70 (7Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Gebauer, M., Zeiner, M., and Gehring, U. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol.in pressGoogle Scholar). Nevertheless, both Hop/p60 and Hap46 inhibit protein refolding, as pointed out above. We were wondering whether Hop/p60 and/or Hap46 may rather exert some of their actions on the level of the chaperonin complex. We thus checked for interactions with CCT in immunoprecipitation experiments with monoclonal antibody 91a against CCT and protein G-Sepharose. We first asked whether Hop/p60 and Hap46 are coprecipitated with CCT from reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 3 A). Indeed, endogenous Hop/p60 was specifically retained and showed up in immunoblots (lane 2). By contrast, endogenous Hap46 was not detectable by this procedure (data not shown). Because the concentration of Hap46 appears to be rather low in reticulocyte lysate, we carried out an experiment in which we added GST-Hap46 to this crude material. Again we did not observe any coprecipitation of Hap46 with CCT (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Moreover, addition of GST-Hap46 did not affect the binding of Hop/p60 to CCT (lane 3). These data clearly demonstrate that CCT interacts with Hop/p60 endogenous to reticulocyte lysate. We extended these immunoprecipitation studies to mixtures of pure proteins. This has the advantage that in particular the effects of heat shock protein chaperones can be tested. Fig. 3 B (top) shows that added Hop/p60 is coprecipitated with CCT and the CCT-specific antibody 91a. Interestingly, addition of hsc70 did not affect the interaction between Hop/p60 and CCT (lane 2). We also included hsp90 in CCT-specific immunoprecipitations and found a slight increase (roughly 20%) in the amount of Hop/p60 coprecipitated (Fig. 3B, top, lane 3 versus lane 1). In controls, we checked all immunoprecipitations for CCT and obtained similar signals throughout (Fig. 3 B, bottom). Routinely, these interaction experiments were in the presence of 1 mm ATP. To check the effect of ADP versus ATP on Hop/p60 binding, we carried out the experiment of Fig. 3 C. We found that ADP and ATP similarly promoted the interaction with CCT (lanes 2 and 3), but there was minimal binding in the absence of these nucleotides (lane 1). To investigate the specificity of the above observed interaction between Hop/p60 and the eukaryotic chaperonin, we also tested the bacterial chaperonin complex GroEL/GroES. To this end we used extracts of E. coli containing endogenous GroEL and recombinant Hop/p60. Following affinity chromatography of GroEL on ATP-agarose, eluates with ATP were checked by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for GroEL and Hop/p60. We observed no specific copurification of Hop/p60 (data not shown). Previous studies by Chen et al. (13Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honoré B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Hop/p60 contains two tetratricopeptide repeat regions which are involved in interactions with hsc70 and hsp90. We constructed two deletion mutants, Hop(116–543) and Hop(1–448), from which either amino- or carboxyl-terminal sequences are missing. Both truncated proteins interacted with hsc70 (15Gebauer, M., Zeiner, M., and Gehring, U. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol.in pressGoogle Scholar), but Hop(1–448) had a roughly 3-fold higher affinity than Hop(116–543). This agrees with data by others (13Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honoré B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lässle M. Blatch G.L. Kundra V. Takatori T. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1876-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and shows that Hop/p60 preferentially binds hsp70s through its amino-terminal portion. We now tested these Hop/p60 variants for interaction with CCT. Significant amounts of Hop(116–543) coprecipitated with CCT and antibody 91a, but interaction with Hop(1–448) was marginal (Fig. 3 D). This unequivocally shows that Hop/p60 interacts with CCT through carboxyl-terminal sequences. Biochemical and electron microscopic analyses have recently pointed to major conformational changes in the complex structure of CCT produced by ATP (18Melki R. Batelier G. Soulié S. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Llorca O. Smyth M.G. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10091-10094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, CCT is known to bind both ATP and ADP, but to bind ADP with higher affinity (18Melki R. Batelier G. Soulié S. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We thus presaturated CCT with unlabeled ADP and measured the ADP/ATP exchange by binding of [γ-33P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 4, Hap46 had no effect (column 1), but addition of Hop/p60 stimulated ATP binding 4–5-fold (column 2). In controls, we found that Hop/p60 by itself does not bind ATP (data not shown). Our experiments also show that Hap46 does not influence the stimulation brought about by Hop/p60 (Fig. 4, column 3 versus Column 2). We thus conclude that the direct interaction of Hop/p60 with CCT (see above) is responsible for the stimulation of the ADP/ATP exchange. Interestingly, both deletants Hop(1–448) and Hop(116–543) exerted no stimulatory effect on the ADP/ATP exchange on CCT (Fig. 4, columns 4 and 5). We also checked the effect of Hop/p60 on the endogenous ATPase activity of CCT. Addition of full-length Hop/p60 resulted in slight stimulation (18%), while the mutants Hop(1–448) and Hop(116–543) had no effect (not shown). Taken together these data show that only full-length Hop/p60 significantly stimulates the ADP/ATP exchange of CCT but not its ATPase activity. Because binding of misfolded substrate proteins to CCT is nucleotide dependent (29Melki R. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we reasoned that Hop/p60 in the presence of ADP or ATP might influence substrate binding to CCT. Luciferase was again used as the model protein and was denatured by urea pretreatment. It was then diluted into buffer containing hsc70 to prevent aggregation. We checked for interaction with CCT by coprecipitation with the CCT-specific antibody 91a and protein G-Sepharose. In control experiments without antibody, only trace amounts of denatured luciferase were retained (data not shown), but with antibody present we obtained strong signals showing that luciferase is specifically bound to CCT (Fig. 5). We observed some decrease in binding of luciferase protein (roughly 20%) in the presence of ATP rather than ADP (lane 3 versus lane 1). This effect was less pronounced than we had expected, probably due to ongoing ATP hydrolysis and increased substrate affinity in the ADP-bound state (29Melki R. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, with ATP present, addition of Hop/p60 largely decreased the amount of luciferase protein bound to CCT (Fig. 5, lane 4 versus lane 3). By contrast, Hop/p60 had no effect on substrate binding in the presence of ADP (lane 2 versus lane 1). The chaperonin-containing TCP-1 complex CCT of eukaryotic cells, also called TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC) or c-cpn (1Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 68-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), appears to be mostly involved in proper intracellular folding of actins and tubulins. However, this may be a quantitative rather than qualitative effect because these cytoskeletal proteins are so abundant in the cytoplasm in comparison with other proteins that may also use this folding system for attaining their native conformations (18Melki R. Batelier G. Soulié S. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We used denatured firefly luciferase, which has quite often served as model substrate protein in refolding experiments and is a bona fide substrate for CCT (30Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Wall J.S. Tempst P. Hartl F.-U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4767-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of Hop/p60 and Hap46 previously observed in a combined system with crude reticulocyte lysate (12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) has now been reproduced with pure components. Enzyme reactivation was inhibited by adding Hop/p60, Hap46, or both together (cf. Fig. 2 A). This is in contrast to our observations with the system containing crude reticulocyte lysate in which we found partial relief of inhibition when adding both Hap46 and Hop/p60 together (12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Probably, this is due to additional factors that affect protein refolding and are contained in the crude system but are not present in purified components. Such crude reticulocyte lysate is known to contain, for example, prefoldin which cooperates with CCT (22Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Moreover, various cofactors specific for individual substrate proteins could exist, as has been described for tubulins (31Gao Y. Vainberg I.E. Chow R.L. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2478-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also members of the hsp100 family could be involved which have recently been shown to function together with hsp70 and hsp40 (32Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). We propose that the inhibitory effect of Hop/p60 on protein refolding results from direct interactions with CCT (cf. Fig. 3 A and Fig. 3 B). We found that Hop/p60 stimulates the ADP/ATP exchange on CCT (cf. Fig. 4) and significantly interferes with the association of misfolded substrate protein in the presence of ATP (cf. Fig. 5). ATP is known to induce a large conformational change in CCT producing a more open configuration with lower substrate affinity (18Melki R. Batelier G. Soulié S. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Llorca O. Smyth M.G. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10091-10094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Melki R. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). With Hop/p60 promoting the ATP-bound form of CCT, it produces a shift toward this conformation. However, the Hop/p60 effect on substrate binding may differ somewhat between various substrate proteins, possibly depending on how well misfolded proteins fit into the cavity of CCT. We suggest that the chaperone cofactors Hap46 and Hop/p60 exert their inhibitory effects on protein folding in different ways: Hap46 through hsp70s and Hop mainly through CCT. Our immunoprecipitation experiments did not provide evidence for a direct and specific interaction between Hap46 and CCT. On the other hand, Hap46 readily associates with hsp70s and is known to diminish the binding of malfolded proteins to these chaperones (7Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 15Gebauer, M., Zeiner, M., and Gehring, U. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol.in pressGoogle Scholar). Hop/p60 interacts with both hsp70s (12Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honoré B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Demand J. Lüders J. Höhfeld J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15Gebauer, M., Zeiner, M., and Gehring, U. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol.in pressGoogle Scholar) and CCT, as shown in the present study. It affects substrate binding to CCT (cf. Fig. 5) but not to hsp70s, as has recently been demonstrated (15Gebauer, M., Zeiner, M., and Gehring, U. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol.in pressGoogle Scholar). We have shown that the eukaryotic chaperonin CCT and the chaperone system hsp70 in conjunction with hsp40 cooperate in luciferase refolding in vitro (cf. Fig. 2 A). We propose that this occurs in vivosubsequent to translation or after damage by stress. In this context, it has been reported that newly synthesized actin and luciferase molecules are associated with CCT, hsp70, and hsp40 (33Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 34Frydman J. Hartl F.U. Science. 1996; 272: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Folding may then occur in ordered ways similar to the coordinated processes described for the bacterial systems of GroEL/GroES and of DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE in vitro and in vivo (24Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 25Gragerov A. Nudler E. Komissarova N. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Nikiforov V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10341-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, however, the relative expression of the protein factors Hop/p60 and Hap46 may contribute to the regulation of protein-folding reactions involving CCT and hsp70/hsp40. This appears possible in view of the fact that both Hop/p60 and Hap46 inhibit refolding efficiently at concentrations roughly equimolar to those of CCT and hsc70 (cf. Fig. 2 B). Our data show that Hop/p60 does not bind to CCT as substrate. It does not compete with denatured luciferase when CCT is in its ADP-bound form (cf. Fig. 5) which has a high affinity for denatured proteins (29Melki R. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, typical CCT substrates are known to stimulate both nucleotide exchange and ATPase activity of the chaperonin (35Melki R. Rommelaere H. Leguy R. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10422-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but Hop/p60 affects only the ADP/ATP exchange (cf. Fig. 4) and not the ATPase of CCT. Stimulation of nucleotide exchange on CCT by Hop/p60 is reminiscent of the Hap46 effect on eukaryotic hsp70s and of GrpE on the prokaryotic DnaK chaperone. However, GrpE in concert with DnaJ leads to strong stimulation of protein-refolding activity of DnaK (36Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) while Hap46 and Hop/p60 rather inhibit reactivation of misfolded structures by way of interactions with hsp70s and CCT, respectively. When we checked truncations of Hop/p60, we found that interaction with CCT occurs with the carboxyl-terminal portion (cf. Fig. 3 D). By contrast, binding to hsc70 involves mainly amino-terminal sequences of Hop/p60 (13Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honoré B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gebauer, M., Zeiner, M., and Gehring, U. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol.in pressGoogle Scholar, 27Lässle M. Blatch G.L. Kundra V. Takatori T. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1876-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and association with hsp90 occurs through the middle portion of Hop/p60 (13Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honoré B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that hsc70 and hsp90 do not significantly influence the binding of Hop/p60 to CCT (cf. Fig. 3 B). While the carboxyl-terminal part of Hop/p60 interacts with CCT, amino-terminal sequences must be involved in affecting nucleotide exchange, as the respective truncation Hop(116–543) did not stimulate ATP binding (cf. Fig. 4). Previous studies with Hop/p60 purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate (called recycling factor for hsp70, RF-hsp70) have suggested that it promotes ADP/ATP exchange on hsp70 (37Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, we and others (15Gebauer, M., Zeiner, M., and Gehring, U. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol.in pressGoogle Scholar,26Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) were unable to confirm this observation using recombinant Hop/p60. Presumably, this effect comes about by some contaminant (26Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). If, for example, a small amount of CCT were copurified with Hop/p60 from reticulocyte lysate, it could well simulate the described ATP-binding effect (37Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Rather than affecting nucleotide binding to hsp70, Hop/p60 might have promoted ATP binding to CCT, as is possible according to our data (cf. Fig. 4). Even though our studies unequivocally demonstrate interaction between Hop/p60 and CCT, they provide no stoichiometric information as to how many molecules bind per CCT hexadecamer. All we can tell at present is that binding of antibody 91a to CCT α-subunits does not interfere with Hop/p60 interaction, suggesting that the antibody and Hop/p60 bind to different sites. Further experiments will be required to establish which subunit of CCT is involved in the interaction with Hop/p60. Possibly, Hop/p60 can interact with more than one kind of such subunits given that these possess regions of high homology (38Kim S. Willison K.R. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed no binding of Hop/p60 to the bacterial chaperonin GroEL even though there are peptide homologies between GroEL and CCT subunits (38Kim S. Willison K.R. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We thank B. Segnitz for hsc70 purified from bovine brain."
https://openalex.org/W2053727682,"In eukaryotes, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a complex reaction requiring multiple proteins. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, two of these proteins, Rad7 and Rad16, are specifically involved in the removal of lesions from transcriptionally silent regions of the genome in vivo. Extracts prepared from rad7 or rad16 mutant cells are deficient, but not totally defective, in both oligonucleotide excision and repair synthesis of damaged plasmid DNA. We show that these extracts are, however, fully proficient in the incision step of the NER reaction in vitro. Furthermore, using acdc9 mutant to trap incision intermediates, we demonstrate that rad7 and rad16 mutants are proficient in NER-dependent DNA incision in vivo. A purified protein complex containing both Rad7 and Rad16 proteins complements the oligonucleotide excision and repair synthesis defects in rad7 and rad16 mutant extracts. We conclude that the products of the RAD7 and RAD16 genes are involved in a postincision event(s) during NER in yeast. In eukaryotes, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a complex reaction requiring multiple proteins. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, two of these proteins, Rad7 and Rad16, are specifically involved in the removal of lesions from transcriptionally silent regions of the genome in vivo. Extracts prepared from rad7 or rad16 mutant cells are deficient, but not totally defective, in both oligonucleotide excision and repair synthesis of damaged plasmid DNA. We show that these extracts are, however, fully proficient in the incision step of the NER reaction in vitro. Furthermore, using acdc9 mutant to trap incision intermediates, we demonstrate that rad7 and rad16 mutants are proficient in NER-dependent DNA incision in vivo. A purified protein complex containing both Rad7 and Rad16 proteins complements the oligonucleotide excision and repair synthesis defects in rad7 and rad16 mutant extracts. We conclude that the products of the RAD7 and RAD16 genes are involved in a postincision event(s) during NER in yeast. nucleotide excision repair whole cell extract N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene kilobase(s) polymerase chain reaction. The yeast RAD7 and RAD16 genes belong to theRAD3 epistasis group of DNA damage-responsive genes (1Hoeijmakers J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Hoeijmakers J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This epistasis group includes genes required for nucleotide excision repair (NER)1 of DNA, a process by which multiple types of base damage are excised from the genome as oligonucleotide fragments, and the resulting single strand gaps are repaired by DNA synthesis (repair synthesis) and ligation (3Friedberg E. Bardwell A. Bardwell L. Feaver W. Kornberg R. Svejstrup J. Tomkinson A. Wang Z. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-B Biol. Sci. 1995; 347: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast to the extreme sensitivity to UV light (and other DNA-damaging agents) conferred by complete inactivation of NER genes, such as RAD1, RAD2, RAD3, RAD4, RAD10, and RAD14, deletion of the RAD7 or RAD16 gene confers partial UV radiation sensitivity (1Hoeijmakers J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Hoeijmakers J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The precise role(s) of the RAD7 and RAD16 gene products in NER is not clear. The proteins are required for NER of transcriptionally repressed loci such as HMLα and HMR a in vivo (4Terleth C. Schenk P. Poot R. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4678-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and for the nontranscribed (coding) strand of transcriptionally active genes. However, unlike the other RAD genes mentioned above, the RAD7 and RAD16 genes are not required for NER of the transcribed (template) strand of such genes (5Verhage R. Zeeman A. de Groot N. Gleig F. Bang D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The Rad7 and Rad16 proteins have been shown to stably interact both in vivo and in vitro (6Wang Z. Wei S. Reed S. Wu X. Svejstrup J. Feaver W. Kornberg R. Friedberg E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Guzder S. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Rad16 is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 superfamily of proteins, several of which have been shown to be ATPases involved in chromatin remodeling (7Bang D. Verhage R. Goosen N. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This observation, coupled with the requirement for the RAD7 and RAD16 genes for NER of transcriptionally repressed regions of the genome, has led to the notion that the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins may be subunits of a complex dedicated to the perturbation of chromatin structure in order to facilitate NER of transcriptionally silent regions of the genome and the nontranscribed strand of transcriptionally active genes (5Verhage R. Zeeman A. de Groot N. Gleig F. Bang D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It has been reported that a reconstituted in vitro system that supports damage-specific incision and oligonucleotide excision from purified plasmid DNA does not require the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins (8Guzder S. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies (9Guzder S. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reported that these proteins actually increase the efficiency of NER in vitro and offered the suggestion that the specific role of these proteins is to facilitate the recognition of damaged bases in nontranscribed regions of the genome in vivo (10Guzder S. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Contrary to the observation that the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins are not required for NER of plasmid DNA in a reconstituted in vitro system, we previously reported that they are indispensable for NER of plasmid DNA in yeast whole cell extracts (WCEs), using an assay that measures repair synthesis of DNA (6Wang Z. Wei S. Reed S. Wu X. Svejstrup J. Feaver W. Kornberg R. Friedberg E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In view of the multiple and in some instances discordant roles proposed for the RAD7 and RAD16 products during NER of DNA, we have studied their requirement for specific events in this process in greater detail. We have investigated the possibility that when purified plasmid DNA is incubated with yeast WCEs, the DNA is assembled into nucleosomes. Such a result could explain the apparent contradiction between the requirement for Rad7 and Rad16 proteins for NER in WCEs and their dispensability in a reconstituted system using purified proteins, and it would also be consistent with the suggestion that the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins are required for the processing of nucleosome structures during NER. Additionally, we have utilized bothin vitro and in vivo assays that allowed us to independently monitor the steps of damage-specific incision, oligonucleotide excision, and repair synthesis in wild-type and rad7 and rad16 mutants. We have found no evidence for nucleosome formation in yeast WCEs that support robust NER of plasmid DNA. We show here that rad7and rad16 mutants are fully proficient in damage-specific incision of DNA. In contrast, the postincision events of oligonucleotide excision and, as previously reported, repair synthesis (6Wang Z. Wei S. Reed S. Wu X. Svejstrup J. Feaver W. Kornberg R. Friedberg E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) are severely deficient in rad7 and rad16mutant extracts. Finally, we have purified a protein complex that includes Rad7 and Rad16 proteins, without overexpression of these proteins in yeast cells. This complex corrects both defective oligonucleotide excision and repair synthesis in vitro. We conclude that the RAD7 and RAD16 gene products participate in postincision events during NER of transcriptionally silent DNA. The utility of such participation may be obviated in transcriptionally active DNA, perhaps as a direct consequence of transcription itself. The RAD+ strain W303-B (mata, ade2–1, trp1–1, leu2–3, 112, his3–11, 15, ura3–1) and the isogenic strains MGSC104 (rad7::LEU2), MGSC97 (rad7::URA3), and W303236 (rad16::URA3) were generously supplied by Dr. Jaap Brouwer (University of Leiden, The Netherlands) (5Verhage R. Zeeman A. de Groot N. Gleig F. Bang D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Other strains used were SX46a (mata, ade2, his3–532, trp1–289, ura3–52) and its isogenic partners MGSC 139 (rad14::LEU2) and SX46a (rad1::URA3), rad4–10(mata, rad4–10, ade2, his3–832, trp1–289) and KG119 (ssl2::TRP1, mata his7–2, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, trp1–289). Strain LP2915–8D (cdc9–2, mata, his3–200, lys2–1, met15–3, trp1–289, ura3–52) was used to examine DNA incision in vivo. Strain LP2915–8D rad2::TRP was generated by transforming LP2915–8D with SalI-digested pWS521. This plasmid was derived from pWS519 containing theRAD2 gene and flanking sequences. Plasmid pWS519 was cut with HpaI-NdeI, thereby removing the entireRAD2 coding sequence. A BglII-EcoRITRPI fragment was exchanged to generate pWS520. Strain LP2915–8D rad7::HIS3 was constructed by transformation of the parent strain with EcoRI-digested pRAD7::HIS3, and strain LP2915–8Drad16::HIS3 was constructed by transformation of the parent strain with EcoRI-BamHI-digested prad16::HIS3. Yeast WCEs capable of supporting NER were prepared as described previously (11Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NER was monitored by measuring DNA repair synthesis in pUC18 containingN-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF) adducts. AAF-modified DNA was prepared by treating pUC18 with AAF and purifying the DNA on a 5–20% sucrose gradient as described (12Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was recovered from extracts by restricting with HindIII enzyme, which linearizes the substrate and reveals a discrete band in a 1% agarose gel. To detect damage-specific incision, plasmid DNA was recovered from WCEs and electrophoresed through agarose without priorHindIII restriction. Undamaged plasmid DNA was analyzed similarly in independent incubations. In the standard NER assay, which measures repair synthesis, an undamaged DNA template is used as an internal control. Background incorporation of radioactivity (typically ∼5% of that in the damaged plasmid) is subtracted from that incorporated in the damaged template. The DNA incision assay precludes the use of a quantitative internal control because a single nick changes the topology of the form I DNA. DNA was visualized in gels under UV light following staining with ethidium bromide. Repair synthesis was detected by autoradiography of dried agarose gels and quantitated by phosphorimaging as described (6Wang Z. Wei S. Reed S. Wu X. Svejstrup J. Feaver W. Kornberg R. Friedberg E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide of known sequence (5′-TATGATTGGGGATAAGAT*TG-3′) containing a single cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer near the 3′-end was kindly prepared by Dr. John-Stephen Taylor (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) (13Shimamura A. Tremethick D. Worcel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4257-4269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ordoukhanian P. Taylor J.-S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3783-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Plasmid substrates containing these oligonucleotides were constructed as described (15Huang J. Svoboda D. Reardon J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 16Moggs J. Yarema K. Essigmann J. Wood R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7177-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Yeast WCEs were prepared and repair reactions were performed as described (17You Z. Feaver W.J. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2668-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following the reactions, radiolabeled excision products were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gels and analyzed by autoradiography. Yeast strains were grown in YPD medium (yeast/peptone/dextrose) overnight at 23 °C (permissive temperature for the cdc9 mutation). All strains were cdc9 ts and were either wild-type for NER (RAD+) or were rad2, rad7, orrad16 mutants. Cells were grown to mid-log phase, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended to a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml. Aliquots were incubated for 30 min at either 23 or 37 °C (nonpermissive temperature for cdc9). Cell suspensions were placed in a Pyrex dish (14 × 1 cm) to a depth of ∼0.3 cm to ensure uniform radiation. Dishes were shaken while cell suspensions were irradiated at 254 nm (70 J/m2) at a dose rate of 1 J/m2/s, using a germicidal lamp. Following irradiation, cells were pooled and kept at 23 or 37 °C for 20 min before harvesting. Unirradiated control samples were harvested for each strain. Cells were lysed with zymolyase 1000T as described (18Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), and DNA was isolated as described (19Campbell I. Duffus J.H. Yeast. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1988Google Scholar). Purified DNA was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA and stored at 4 °C. All procedures were carried out under safety lights to prevent enzymatic photoreactivation of pyrimidine dimers. Analysis of DNA incision at the MATα and HMLα loci was performed by Southern blot analysis as described (20Bohr V. Smith C. Okumoto D. Hanawalt P. Cell. 1985; 40: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar).MATα and HMLα fragments were generated by digesting genomic DNA with HaeII enzyme, which yields a 3.6-kb MATα fragment and a 4.0-kb HMLαfragment. The probe was an internal fragment of the Yαregion of MATα, which is strictly α-specific (see below) (21Terleth C. van Sluis C. van de Putte P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4433-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). DNA (5 μg) was restricted with HaeII and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The DNA was recovered after phenol-chloroform extraction and resuspended in 10 μl of denaturing loading buffer (12.5% Ficoll, 5 mm EDTA, 0.125% bromphenol blue, 0.25 m NaOH). Aliquots from eachHaeII restriction digest (with appropriate controls) were quantified by spectroscopy to ensure equal loading onto 1% alkaline agarose gels. Electrophoresis was performed overnight at 1.5 V/cm under denaturing conditions. DNA was vacuum-blotted to Genescreen plus (NEN) transfer membranes. The membranes were prehybridized for 1 h and then hybridized with a specific radiolabeled probe prepared by random primer labeling. MATα and HMLα bands were visualized by autoradiography. A 6-His-taggedRAD7 strain was constructed with the RAD7 gene expressed from its own promoter on a centromeric plasmid. This strain was derived from strain YPH/TFB1:6-His (22Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), in which the deleted chromosomal TFB1 gene was replaced with the LEU2marker. The strain carries a 6-His-tagged TFB1 gene driven by its own promoter on a centromeric vector. The chromosomalRAD7 gene was deleted using the one-step disruption technique (23Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 194: 281-301Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Strain YPH/TFB1:6-His was transformed withEcoRI-digested prad7::HIS. This plasmid was constructed by digesting prad7::LEU2 (5Verhage R. Zeeman A. de Groot N. Gleig F. Bang D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) with KpnI and HindIII, blunting the ends by filling in, and replacing the LEU2 gene with a 1.8-kb BamHI fragment containing HIS3. Generation of the strain YPH/TFB1:6-His, rad7 was confirmed by Southern analysis. Additionally, survival studies revealed a level of UV radiation sensitivity consistent with that expected for rad7 mutants. The centromeric plasmid pRS314, containing an untagged copy of TFB1 and the TRP1marker (provided by Dr. W. John Feaver), was used to clone a 6-His-tagged RAD7 gene. This construct was introduced into strain YPH/TFB1:6-His, rad7. The 6-His-tagged RAD7 insert was generated by PCR. In addition to the RAD7 coding sequence, the insert includes the promoter region for RAD7. The 6-His tag was generated at the C terminus of the protein by including codons for histidine in the downstream primer immediately prior to the stop codon. Both primers included BamHI sites at their 5′-ends to facilitate cloning of the PCR-generated product into the BamHI site of the pRS314-TFB1vector. The sequence of the primers was as follows: upstream primer, 5′ATATGGATCCTTTCTCCCCGACGATATAGGAATC 3′; downstream primer, 5′ATATGGATCCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTATACTGTCACTCTGTCTCCCTAT3′. The 2.2-kb PCR product was cut with BamHI and cloned into theBamHI site of pRS314-TFB1-TRP1. Following cloning, the insert was sequenced to confirm the RAD7 sequence and the in-frame addition of the 6-His-tag. Transformation of strain YPH/TFB1:6-His, rad7 with pRS314-TFB1, RAD7:6-His resulted in complementation of UV radiation sensitivity. An untaggedRAD7 strain was constructed in the same fashion. During final transformations, plasmid shuffling was employed to remove the 6-His-tagged TFB1:URA3 plasmid. The RAD7gene was isolated from pAS1-CYH2RAD7 and cloned into theNcoI/SalI site of pGEX-KG, creating an in-frameRAD7-glutathione S-transferase fusion gene (6Wang Z. Wei S. Reed S. Wu X. Svejstrup J. Feaver W. Kornberg R. Friedberg E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A 0.6-kb internal fragment of RAD16 that encodes 192 amino acids (from amino acids 475–667) was generated by PCR using the following primers: upstream primer, 5′CATGCCATGGATCTTTACAGAAGT3′; downstream primer, 5′CCTGAAGCTTCACTGTTTGAA3′. The upstream primer included an NcoI site, whereas the downstream primer included a HindIII site to facilitate cloning of the PCR product in-frame into the pGEX-KG vector and allow expression of glutathione S-transferase-RAD16 fusion protein. E. coli DH5α cells were transfected with each of the constructs, and induction of the fusion genes was achieved by addition of 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Both fusion proteins were insoluble in E. coli. We therefore purified fusion proteins from inclusion bodies by affinity chromatography on glutathione agarose as described (24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). After immobilizing fusion proteins on glutathione-agarose beads, we cleaved at the glycine linker regions between the Rad and the glutathioneS-transferase moieties with thrombin (24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) to isolate each Rad protein. Purified full-length Rad7 and truncated Rad16 proteins were used as antigens to generate polyclonal antisera in rabbits (Babco). Rad7 antibodies were purified from rabbit sera using antigens cross-linked to cyanogen bromide-activated sepharose-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 10-liter culture of strain YPH/RAD7:6-His was grown in YPD medium until the cell density reached 108cells/ml. Cell paste (∼100 g) was recovered following centrifugation. Cells were washed at 4 °C, and all manipulations from this point were at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 200 ml of extraction Buffer A (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 350 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.097 units of trypsin inhibitor/ml of aprotinin). The cell suspension (300 ml) was disrupted in a Biospec bead beater apparatus using Zirconium beads (0.5 mm). Cells were disrupted with 20 cycles of agitation and intermittent cooling. After washing the beads, the extract (300 ml) was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 80 min and mixed with 10 ml of Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A. The mixture was rocked for 15 min and then centrifuged twice at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove the resin. Unbound protein was added batchwise to 10 ml Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) for 3 h at 4 °C. The suspension was transferred to a glass column (1.5 × 20 cm). The flow-through was collected, and the column was washed with 50 ml of Buffer A supplemented with 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration) and 10 mm imidazole. No Rad7 protein was detected by immunoblotting in either the flow-through fractions or after washing. His-tagged Rad7 protein was eluted from the column with Buffer A plus 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 25, 50, or 100 mmimidazole. The peak of both Rad7 and Rad16 proteins eluted in 25–50 mm imidazole (see Fig. 2). The strain containing the untagged RAD7 gene was subjected to the same procedure in parallel. No binding of Rad7 (Fig. 1) or Rad16 (data not shown) was observed in the nontagged strain. Fractions 1–6 from Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid were pooled (21 ml), dialyzed against Buffer A with 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h, and applied to a column of phosphocellulose (P11, Whatman, 1.5 × 8 cm; 14-ml matrix). The column was washed and eluted with a 60-ml salt gradient (0.1–1.0m NaCl) in Buffer A. Rad7 and Rad16 proteins co-eluted in fractions 7–10 at 480 mm NaCl (Fig. 2). Pooled P11 fractions (8 ml) were dialyzed against Buffer A with 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol and fractionated on DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1.5 × 8 cm; 14-ml matrix). Fractions were collected following elution with a 60-ml salt gradient from 0.1–1.0m NaCl. Immunoblotting revealed co-fractionation of Rad7 and Rad16 proteins (Fig. 2). Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed and further fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono-Q HR5/5 column using a 10-ml salt gradient (0.1–1.0 mNaCl). Once again, Rad7 and Rad16 proteins co-eluted (Fig. 2). Mono-Q fractions were pooled (1.5 ml) and concentrated in a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon) to a volume of 200 μl. This was layered on a glycerol gradient (10–30% glycerol). The gradient was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16 h in a SW41 rotor. Fractions were collected, and Rad7 and Rad16 proteins were shown to co-elute (Fig. 2).Figure 1Western blot analysis showing specific binding of His-tagged Rad7 protein to the Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid matrix. Yeast WCEs were prepared from strains expressing the Rad7 protein with or without a C-terminal His6 tag. Tagged Rad7 protein was eluted with 25 mm and 50 mm imidazole in Buffer A (lanes 1 and 3, respectively). Untagged Rad7 protein was detected in the flow-through (FT) fractions (lane 6) but not in the column wash (lane 5) or 50 or 25 mm imidazole fractions (lanes 2 and 4, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In view of the notion that theRAD7 and RAD16 gene products may be required for the processing of chromatin during NER (4Terleth C. Schenk P. Poot R. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4678-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that chromatin or some other higher ordered DNA structure is generated during incubation of WCEs with purified plasmid DNA. We harvested plasmid DNA following incubation with yeast WCEs known to support robust NER and digested it with micrococcal nuclease. This enzyme cleaves nucleosomal DNA in linker regions, yielding a characteristic ladder of oligonucleosome fragments (25Becker P. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2241-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In control experiments, we demonstrated efficient nucleosome formation following incubation of damaged plasmid DNA with Xenopus oocyte extracts (data not shown). However, we failed to observe a nucleosomal ladder in plasmid DNA incubated in yeast WCEs following mild micrococcal nuclease digestion conditions (data not shown). Hence, there is no evidence of nucleosome formation on the input plasmid DNA in these yeast WCEs. In an effort to identify a specific molecular defect in rad7and rad16 mutants, we next examined individual steps in the NER reaction in yeast WCEs. We analyzed damage-specific incision of plasmid DNA in RAD + and in rad7, rad16, rad14, rad4, and ssl2 mutant extracts by monitoring the conversion of AAF-damaged form I DNA to the relaxed state. Extracts of the latter three mutants are known to be totally defective in damage-specific incision of DNA in vitro (8Guzder S. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). When covalently closed circular (form I) AAF-treated plasmid DNA (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) was incubated with 250 μg of WCEs prepared from RAD+ strains, the DNA was converted to the relaxed state (form II) within 2 min of incubation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–5), indicating incision of the DNA. When these experiments were repeated using a 10-fold reduced concentration of extract (25 μg of protein), subsaturating conditions were achieved, and only partial conversion of form I to form II DNA was observed at 2 min (Fig. 3 B). As anticipated, when damaged plasmid DNA was incubated with extracts from the incision-defectiverad14, rad4 or ssl2 mutants, the DNA remained in the form I state (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4–6). In contrast, incubation with 250 μg of protein (Fig. 5 A) or subsaturating amounts of protein (25 μg) (Fig. 5 B) from a rad7 mutant resulted in identical kinetics of conversion of form I to form II DNA as observed with the RAD+ strain (Fig. 3, A and B). This result was confirmed in a direct comparison of wild-type, rad7, rad16, and various NER-defective mutants (Fig. 4 A). The same results were obtained withrad16 mutant extracts (data not shown). Thus,rad7 and rad16 mutant extracts are as active as wild-type extracts with respect to damage-specific incision of DNA.Figure 4A, ethidium bromide-stained gel showing the effect of incubating substrate DNA with wild-type and variousrad mutant extracts.

The difference in the kinetics of repair synthesis and DNA incision reflects the fact that just a single nick in the form I substrate DNA converts it to the form II state, whereas the detection of radioactivity incorporated during repair synthesis is significantly less sensitive. Only background levels of repair synthesis were observed with extracts of rad4, rad14, and ssl2 mutants (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4–6). Consistent with the results of previous studies (6Wang Z. Wei S. Reed S. Wu X. Svejstrup J. Feaver W. Kornberg R. Friedberg E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), extracts of both rad7 and rad16mutants supported markedly reduced (but clearly detectable) levels of repair synthesis in form II DNA (Figs. 4 B and 5 C). We have previously shown that the level of repair synthesis does not increase as a function of increasing the amount of WCEs (10Guzder S. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol.

The DNA-binding protein hGABPα cannot affect transcription by itself, but can modify hGABP-dependent transcription in vitro and in vivo in the presence of its associated subunits. In this study, co-transfection assays showed that the ratio of hGABPβ to hGABPγ affected transcription from a promoter containing hGABP binding sites.

Transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II is regulated by various promoter-specific activators (1Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), which bind to specific DNA sequences where they interact with various components of the transcriptional machinery. To understand the molecular basis of transcription regulation, it is important to know the effects of complex formation of these factors on transcription regulation. Human GABP (hGABP)1 was originally identified in HeLa cell nuclear extract under the name E4TF1 and was shown to be one of the transcription factors responsible for adenovirus early region 4 gene transcription (2Watanabe H. Imai T. Sharp P.A. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1290-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Later, it was revealed to be a human homologue of murine GABP, which was identified from rat liver cells as a factor capable of binding to the herpes simplex virus immediate early gene promoter (3Thompson C.C.

Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In recent years, hGABP (or GABP) was also reported to be a transcription factor responsible for the expression of various cellular proteins such as the leukocyte-specific adhesion molecule CD18 (β2 leukocyte integrin) (5Rosmarin A.G.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of hGABP revealed that hGABP was composed of a DNA-binding subunit hGABPα and either one of two associated subunits, hGABPβ or hGABPγ (10Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The genes for hGABPα and hGABPβ have been mapped on human chromosome 21q21.2-p21.3 and 7q11.21, respectively (11Sawada J-i. Goto M. Watanabe H. Handa H. Yoshida M.C. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1995; 86: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 12Goto M. Shimizu T. Sawada J-i. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Ichikawa H. Ohira M. Ohki M. Handa H. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 337-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). hGABPα is an Ets-related DNA-binding protein that recognizes the specific sequence 5′-CGGAAGTG-3′, but is unable to stimulate transcription by itself (10Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Watanabe H. Sawada J. Yano K. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell.

It can form a heterocomplex with either hGABPβ or hGABPγ (14Sawada J-i. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). hGABPβ and hGABPγ share a common amino acid sequence in their amino-terminal regions including four tandem repeats homologous to the Notch/ankyrin repeat motif (10Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Watanabe H. Sawada J. Yano K. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which is responsible for heterodimerization. hGABPβ contains a leucine zipper-like motif in its carboxyl terminus region which is necessary for its homodimerization and capacity to activate transcription (14Sawada J-i. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Sawa C. Goto M. Suzuki F. Watanabe H. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Via these dimerization domains, hGABPα and hGABPβ can form a α2β2heterotetrameric complex, which is able to stimulate transcription efficiently in vitro and in vivo (14Sawada J-i. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Sawa C. Goto M. Suzuki F. Watanabe H. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the other associated subunit, hGABPγ, can form heterodimers, but not heterotetramers, with hGABPα because it lacks the leucine zipper-like motif. Also, this heterodimer cannot mediate transactivation (14Sawada J-i. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Sawa C. Goto M. Suzuki F. Watanabe H. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). hGABPβ was reported to specifically recognize only hGABPα, but not other Ets family proteins (16Brown T.A. Mcknight S.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that hGABPβ and hGABPγ play important roles both in the complex formation and transcriptional regulation of hGABPα. In resent years, it has been revealed that some promoter specific activators with DNA binding activity need co-activators for transactivation. Therefore, it is possible that co-activators having different transactivation potentials competitively interact with a DNA-binding factor to precisely control the transcription of certain target genes. Transcriptional regulation by hGABP seems to be a good model system to study such controls mediated by competitive co-activators. In order to expand our understanding of the transcription regulation of hGABP complexes, we examined the influence of hGABPβ and hGABPγ on hGABP-mediated transcription regulation and determined the kinetics of the interactions between the different hGABP subunits and between hGABP and DNA. Whole cell extracts of variable cell lines were prepared according to Manley et al.'s (17Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) method. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 1 × 106co-transfected cells as described previously (18Andrews N.C. Fuller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts and equivalent amounts of nuclear extracts were loaded on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon transfer membranes (Millipore) and hGABP proteins were detected using the ECL detection kit for rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and polyclonal antibody against hGABPβ and hGABPγ. Co-transfection assays, luciferase assays, and β-galactosidase assays were carried out as described previously (6Savoysky E. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Watanabe H. Sawada J-i. Nomura H. Ohsugi Y. Handa H. Sakai T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1839-1846PubMed Google Scholar) except that the transfection scales were reduced to one third. hGABPα, hGABPβ, and hGABPγ were expressed individually in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) as described previously (13Watanabe H. Sawada J. Yano K. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). hGABPα was purified from the lysate using latex particles bound to DNA containing the hGABP-binding sequence (19Kawaguchi H. Asai A. Ohtuka Y. Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6229-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Inomata Y. Kawaguchi H. Hiramoto M. Wada T. Handa H. Anal.

Ed. 1994; 5: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). hGABPβ and hGABPγ were prepared from the insoluble fraction of E. coli lysates. Insoluble fractions containing hGABPβ or hGABPγ were dissolved and denatured by the addition of 0.05TGKEDN (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with 6m guanidine hydrochloride. The proteins were then renatured by dialysis for 6 h against 0.05TGKEDN followed by another 6 h against 0.03TKEDT (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mmKCl, 0.005% Tween 20). The concentrations of the hGABP subunits were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The renaturation efficiency of hGABPβ and hGABPγ was determined by comparing the degree of complex formation of renatured proteins with hGABPα to that of native proteins with hGABPα using the gel-shift assay. The native proteins were co-purified with hGABPα by affinity chromatography on latex particles containing DNA with the hGABP-binding sequence. Gel-shift assays were performed as described (10Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Sawada J-i. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) except that polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was carried out for 30 min at 4 °C. The amounts of protein-bound and free reactants separated by nondenaturing PAGE were measured using the AMBIS system (AMBIS). The equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) of hGABPα for its DNA binding site was calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis. Various equilibrium states were obtained by the addition of increasing amounts of unlabeled probe DNA to the binding reactions containing either a constant amount of hGABPα alone or hGABPα and hGABPγ. The slope of the plots, 1/[DNA/hGABPα]equilibrium against 1/[DNA]equilibrium, representsK D/[hGABPα]input. For the analysis of the dissociation rate constant (k d) of hGABPα for its binding site, the 32P-labeled probe was incubated with hGABPα for 30 min at 30 °C followed by the addition of a 150-fold excess of unlabeled probe DNA to the reaction. After 0–9 min, protein-DNA complexes were separated from free DNA by PAGE and amounts of protein-DNA complex were quantified by measuring the radioactivity in each band. A single-exponential dissociation rate equation [DNA/hGABPα]t = [DNA/hGABPα]0 e −k d t was used to estimate the dissociation constant (k d), which corresponded to the slope of the semilogarithmic plots of [DNA/hGABPα]t/[DNA/hGABPα]0 againstt, where 0 and t represent the time 0 and t after the addition of the unlabeled probe. The SPR-based biosensor system, BIAcore2000 system (BIACORE), was used to detect in real-time the association and dissociation reactions between hGABP and DNA or between hGABP subunits. A continuous flow of running buffer 1 (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 30 mm KCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20) was maintained at 15 μl/min for all of the experiments. hGABP subunits as analytes were diluted to various concentrations with running buffer 1 and were then injected so that they passed over the sensor chip surface containing the immobilized ligands. Running buffer 1 was automatically replaced with the analyte solution with no intermediate delay. The sensor chip surfaces were regenerated at the end of each detection by injecting a pulse of 2.0 m KCl for immobilized oligonucleotides or 6.0m guanidine HCl for immobilized hGABP subunits. The data was described in the form of sensorgrams (plots of resonance units (RU)versus time), and could be used to estimate association and dissociation kinetics. A Sensor Chip SA5 (BIACORE) containing streptavidin covalently preimmobilized to dextran was used for the immobilization of the biotinylated oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides containing the core DNA sequence of the hGABP binding site, 5′-CGGAAGTG-3′ (DNA1), or mutated DNA sequences (DNA2) as shown in Table I were synthesized by an Oligo 1000 m DNA synthesizer (Beckman). The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed prior to biotinylatiton with Biotin-21-UTP (CLONTECH) and Klenow fragment. Nonincorporated Biotin-21-UTP was removed by passing through a Nick Column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). They were diluted to 0.02 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.3 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA and applied to the sensor surface at a constant flow rate of 10 μl/min so that the sensor surface could capture the canonical or mutant oligonucleotides via the biotin-streptavidin interaction. For the immobilization of hGABP subunits to the sensor surface of a Sensor Chip CM5 (BIACORE), the amine-coupling kit (BIACORE) was used according to manufacturer's directions. Briefly, carboxymethyl dextran on the sensor surface was activated by injecting 30 μl of a mixture of 0.05 m EDC and 0.2 m N-hydroxysuccinimide, and then hGABP subunits, which were diluted to 20 μg/ml with 10 mm sodium citrate (pH 3.6), were applied to the sensor surface to create covalent links with carboxymethyl dextran. The remaining active esters were blocked and deactivated by the additional injection of 35 μl of 1.0 methanolamine.Table IOligonucleotides and sequencesDNA15′-AAATTTTCTTAAAATGGAGAGTTACGTAACGTGGGGAAAACGGAAGTGACGATT-3′3′- AAAAGAATTTTACCTCTCAATGCATTGCACCCGTTTTGCCTTCACTGCTAA-5′DNA25′-AAATTTTCTTAAAATGGAGAGTTACGTAACGTGGGGAAAACGagAGTGACGATT-3′3′- AAAAGAATTTTACCTCTCAATGCATTGCACCCGTTTTGCtcTCACTGCTAA-5′The hGABP-binding site and mutation are designated by boldface letters and small letters, respectively.

The rate constants of DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions were calculated by a nonlinear analysis of the association and dissociation curves using the SPR kinetic evaluation software BIAevaluation 2.1. (BIACORE). The kinetic data were interpreted in the context of a first order kinetic model: A + B = AB (22Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 23O'Shannessy D.J. Bringham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). From the analysis of the sensorgrams of the dissociation phase, dissociation rate constants (k d) were calculated: ln(R t/R 0) = −k (t −t 0), where R t and R 0 represent the SPR signal expressed in RU at time t and at the starting time of dissociation,t 0, respectively. The slope value in a plot of ln(dR/dt) against t is expressed as − k s. Based on this value, the association rate constant (k a) was calculated:k s = Ck a +k d, where C denotes the concentration of analyte. The value of the equilibrium dissociation constant was calculated from the value of the association rate constant and a single averaged dissociation rate constant was derived according to the thermodynamic relationship: K D =k d/k a. The self-consistency of the data obtained from the SPR system was confirmed when theseK D values were found to be approximately equal to those of the equilibrium constants,K Deq, evaluated by fitting data of the steady state response level, R sat, to the equation: 1/R sat = (K Deq +C)/(R max C), whereR max denotes the SPR signal corresponding to complete saturation of immobilized acceptor with analyte. We previously reported the cloning of two types of cDNAs for hGABPα-associated factors, hGABPβ and hGABPγ, from a HeLa cDNA library. To examine whether hGABPβ and hGABPγ are co-expressed in various cell lines, Western blotting analysis was carried out using polyclonal antibody directed against each factor. As shown in Fig. 1, all of the extracts from HeLa, Jurkat, and 293 cells contained both hGABPβ and hGABPγ. However, the ratio of hGABPβ to hGABPγ varied depending on the cell type. Duplex bands of hGABPβ and hGABPγ correspond to variants of these proteins containing a 12-amino acid insert at a position after 195 amino acids (24Gugneja S. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the ratio of hGABPγ to hGABPβ may influence the transcription regulation mediated by hGABPα. Our previous study using in vitro and in vivo assays showed that the hGABPα·hGABPβ heterotetramer was able to stimulate transcription, whereas the hGABPα·hGABPγ heterodimer was not. To examine the possibility that the ratio of hGABPβ to hGABPγ plays a role in the control of transcription from promoters with hGABP binding sites, co-transfection assays were performed using Drosophila melanogaster Schneider line 2 (SL2) cells (Fig. 2 A). The plasmid pE4-luciferase has the luciferase gene under the control of the adenovirus early 4 promoter which contains a hGABP binding site. Various amounts of hGABPγ expression plasmid were transfected into the cells along with constant amounts of pE4-luciferase and expression plasmids for hGABPα and hGABPβ. Luciferase activities were observed to decrease as a function of the increase in the amount of transfected hGABPγ expression plasmid. When equal amounts of hGABPβ and hGABPγ expression plasmids were transfected, the luciferase activity was reduced by half, compared with when no hGABPγ expression plasmid was employed (lane 3 and 6). Conversely, when various amounts of the hGABPβ expression plasmid were transfected with constant amounts of hGABPα and hGABPγ expression plasmids, transactivation activities were found to increase as a function of the augmentation in the amount of transfected hGABPβ expression plasmid. To check the expression level of hGABPβ and hGABPγ, we employed a Western blotting assay using nuclear extracts prepared from the corresponding transfected cells and polyclonal antibody against hGABPβ and hGABPγ. The results revealed that the amounts of hGABPβ and hGABPγ in the nuclei of the transfected cells were correlated to amounts of the corresponding expression plasmids (Fig. 2 B). To examine hGABP complex formation on the adenovirus early 4 promoter in the presence of hGABPα, hGABPβ, and hGABPγ, gel-shift assays were carried out using the recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, the amounts of the hGABPα·hGABPβ heterotetramer and hGABPα·hGABPγ heterodimer roughly correlated with the amounts of hGABPβ and hGABPγ, respectively. This result showed that hGABPβ and hGABPγ bind to hGABPα competitively, and that hGABPγ can drive all of the hGABPα·hGABPβ heterotetramer complex into the hGABPα·hGABPγ heterodimer complex, and vice versa. Furthermore, luciferase activities were correlated with the amount of the hGABPα·hGABPβ heterotetramer. Taken together, these results suggested that hGABP-mediated transcription activation was controlled by the quantitative ratio of hGABPβ to hGABPγ in the cells.Figure 3hGABPβ and hGABPγ compete with each other to bind to hGABPα. Before adding 3 ng of hGABPα and 1 ng of α-32P-labeled adenovirus Early 4 promoter DNA, the following amounts of hGABPβ and hGABPγ were added and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Lanes 2–6, 2.5 ng of hGABPβ and indicated amounts of hGABPγ; lanes 7–11, 2.5 ng of hGABPγ and indicated amounts of hGABPβ. In lanes 1, 12, and 13, 3 ng of hGABPα were used along with indicated amounts of hGABPβ or hGABPγ. Each band detected is indicated on the left by an arrowhead.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies of the interactions between hGABPα and its two associated subunits hGABPβ and hGABPγ were performed using gel-shift assays (10Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, no kinetic estimates of the affinities involved in these interactions were obtained using this technique. To examine for an eventual difference in the affinity between hGABPβ and hGABPγ for hGABPα, we employed the SPR system. First, using hGABPγ immobilized on the sensor chip surface, the binding reaction between hGABPα and hGABPγ was studied by injecting hGABPα at various concentrations (Fig. 4 A). The values of thek d, k a, and K Dwere estimated from the experimental curves as being 3.6 ± 0.86 × 10−4 s−1, 5.7 ± 0.18 × 105m−1 s−1, and 6.4 ± 1.7 × 10−10m, respectively (Fig. 4 B). The data used to construct the curves was corrected by subtracting the responses of an empty sensor chip surface from the responses of a hGABPγ-immobilized sensor chip surface. Kinetic values were also calculated using a sensor surface with immobilized hGABPα. Analysis of the experimental curves yielded kinetic constants of 6.5 ± 0.97 × 10−4 s−1, 4.0 ± 0.60 × 105m−1 s−1, and 17 ± 5.0 × 10−10m for thek d, k a, and K D, respectively (Table II). Thus, there exist discrepancies in these values, depending on which protein is bound to the sensor chip. This may reflect the negative charges of dextran on the sensor chip surface or the heterogeneity in the immobilizing sites introduced by the immobilization procedure.Table IIKinetic parameters for hGABP determined by SPR analysisLigandAnalytek ak dK D×105(M−1s−1)×10−4(s−1)×10−10 (m)DNA1hGABPα30 ± 0.9044 ± 6.415 ± 2.6DNA1hGABPαγ16 ± 0.22hGABPγhGABPα5.7 ± 0.183.6 ± 0.866.4 ± 1.7hGABPβhGABPα5.5 ± 0.264.3 ± 0.147.8 ± 0.63hGABPαhGABPγ4.0 ± 0.606.5 ± 0.9717 ± 5.0DNA1hGABPα8.32-aThese values are determined by gel-shift assay.192-aThese values are determined by gel-shift assay.232-aThese values are determined by gel-shift assay.2-a These values are determined by gel-shift assay. Open table in a new tab Similarly, the binding of hGABPα to immobilized hGABPβ was also analyzed using the SPR system. The kinetic constants were determined to be 4.3 ± 0.14 × 10−4 s−1, 5.5 ± 0.26 × 105m−1 s−1, and 7.8 ± 0.63 × 10−10m for thek d, k a, and K D, respectively (Table II). These results suggest that hGABPβ and hGABPγ bind to hGABPα with similar affinities. To examine whether the binding of hGABPβ or hGABPγ to hGABPα affects the DNA binding activity of hGABPα, gel-shift assays were performed. When increasing amounts of hGABPβ or hGABPγ were added to the binding reactions containing constant amounts of 32P-labeled DNA probe and hGABPα protein, the level of free DNA was lowered compared with when hGABPα associated factors were not added (Fig. 5). This suggests that the binding of hGABPα-associated factors enhances the stability of the interaction between hGABPα and DNA. To further analyze the phenomenon kinetically, the dissociation rates of both hGABPα·hGABPβ and hGABPα·hGABPγ complexes from the probe were measured and compared with that of hGABPα by the gel-shift assay. In both cases, about a 10-fold stabilization was observed in the dissociation rate constant compared with the hGABPα-DNA interaction whose equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) and dissociation rate constant (k d) were found to be 2310−10m and 1.910−3s−1 (Fig. 6), respectively.Figure 6Analysis of the interaction between hGABPα and DNA using the gel-shift assay. A, the gel-shift assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The indicated amounts of nonradiolabeled DNA were used with 0.5 ng of32P-labeled DNA in each reaction containing 2 ng (lanes 1–5) or 5 ng (lanes 6–10) of hGABP (except for lane 11). B, Lineweaver-Bark plot of the gel-shift assay shown in panel A. The radioactivity in each band corresponding to both free DNA and DNA·hGABPα complex was measured by the AMBIS system (AMBIS) and plotted. 2 ng (open circles) or 5 ng (closed diamonds) of hGABPα were used in the assay. C, gel-shift assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 5 ng of hGABPα and 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled DNA probe were mixed. After the incubation, 30 ng of nonradiolabeled DNA probe was added to the reaction (lanes 2–6). After the indicated time, the reaction mixtures were applied to PAGE. D, semi-log plots of the relative amounts of the DNA·hGABPα complex. After the gel-shift assay shown in panel C, the radioactivity of each band corresponding to the DNA·hGABPα complex was measured by the AMBIS system (AMBIS) and plotted. The slope represents −k d. 2 ng (open squares) or 5 ng (closed diamonds) of hGABPα were used in the gel-shift assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm that hGABPα-associated factors enhance the affinity of hGABPα for DNA, the SPR system was also employed to measure the dissociation rate constant, as rebinding reactions between hGABP complex and DNA and between hGABP subunits can be avoided using this system. The effect of hGABPγ on hGABPα-DNA binding was taken to be representative of those of hGABPβ and hGABPγ, as they share the same binding mechanism and affinity for hGABPα. Oligonucleotides with the hGABP-binding sequence (DNA1; Table I) or mutated sequence (DNA2; Table I) were immobilized on the surface of a sensor chip SA5 via biotin-avidin interactions. First, repetitive injections of various concentrations of hGABPα were carried out for precise estimations of the kinetic parameters (Fig. 7 A). The response was only detected when the sensor surface contained DNA1, while there was no response using sensor surfaces lacking oligonucleotides or containing DNA2. The analyses of the experimental curves gave a dissociation rate constant (k d), an association rate constant (k a), and an equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) between hGABPα and its DNA binding site of 4.4 ± 0.64 × 10−3s−1, 3.0 ± 0.090 × 106m−1 s−1, and 15 ± 2.6 × 10−10m, respectively. These values were similar with those evaluated by the gel-shift assay. Next, the analyte mixtures containing a constant concentration of hGABPα and increasing concentrations of hGABPγ were passed over the DNA1 immobilized on the sensor surface (Fig. 7 C). In the dissociation phase of each of the sensorgrams, the response level was normalized at the point where the dissociation reaction began (Fig. 7 D). The results showed that the dissociation rate of hGABPα from the immobilized DNA became gradually lower as the concentration of hGABPγ was increased in the analyte mixture. This result is consistent with the results obtained by the gel-shift assay. Using these results, we estimated the dissociation rate constant of the interaction between the hGABP binding site and the hGABPα·hGABPγ complex. We used the experimental curve of dissociation obtained by injecting a mixture of 20 nm hGABPα and 80 nm hGABPγ because factors binding to DNA were thought to contain little hGABPα alone at the beginning of dissociation. We analyzed this curve as the sum of two dissociation modes. One dissociation pathway was that of the hGABPα·hGABPγ complex from the DNA. The other one was the dissociation pathway of hGABPγ from hGABPα and the following dissociation of hGABPα from the DNA. The dissociation rate constant of hGABPα·hGABPγ complex from the DNA was calculated to be 1.6 ± 0.022 × 10−3 s−1, which is about 2.8-fold less than the k d value of hGABPα alone. We confirmed that the experimental dissociation curves almost coincided with ideal interaction curves which were simulated with kinetic constants. The result suggests that the binding of hGABPγ to hGABPα stabilizes the DNA-hGABPα interaction by imparting a lower dissociation rate constant. In this report, we studied the role of hGABPα-associated proteins hGABPβ and hGABPγ in hGABP-mediated transcriptional activation and their effect on the DNA binding activity of hGABPα. We also sought to determine the interaction affinity of hGABPα for hGABPβ, hGABPγ, and DNA. Many Ets family proteins have been shown to possess associated factors that result in the formation of large complexes with various levels of transcription activity (25Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We previously showed that hGABPβ and hGABPγ are functional partners of Ets-related hGABPα. Here, we show that they have similar affinities for hGABPα and that they compete with one another for binding to hGABPα to regulate transcription activity. These findings are supported by functional domain analysis (14Sawada J-i. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which has revealed that hGABPβ and hGABPγ have identical domains required for binding to hGABPα. The similarK D values of hGABPβ and hGABPγ for hGABPα would also appear to reflect the ratio of the hGABPα·hGABPβ complex to the hGABPα·hGABPγ complex in cells which is dependent on the respective intracellular concentrations of hGABPβ and hGABPγ. The transcription activation of hGABP is dependent on the ratio of hGABPβ to hGABPγ. These hGABP complexes have been shown to have different transcription activities in vivo and in vitro, depending on whether they are made up of hGABPα·hGABPβ complex or the hGABPα·hGABPγ complex (14Sawada J-i. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,15Sawa C. Goto M. Suzuki F. Watanabe H. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our results by Northern blot assay show that the expression levels of hGABPγ mRNA were varied in human tissues examined, compared with that of hGABPβ (data not shown). Therefor, the ratio of the hGABPγ mRNA to hGABPβ mRNA was different in various human tissues. For example, the ratios in skeletal muscle, liver and testis were 0.26, 0.43, and 1.2, respectively. This result is reminiscent of a similar observation previously reported by M. Marchioni et al. (32Marchioni M. Morabito S. Salvati A.L. Beccari E. Carnevali F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6479-6489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who found that the pattern of immunologically related hGABPβ subunit expression changes during Xenopus embryonic development while the pattern of hGABPα-like protein expression remains almost the same. These suggest that the ratio of hGABPβ to hGABPγ may contribute to the characters and functions of the tissues. Taken together, the results of the co-transfection assays and the kinetic studies suggest that the quantitative ratio of hGABPβ to hGABPγ directly influences the relative amounts of hGABPα·hGABPβ complex and hGABPα·hGABPγ complex in the cell, resulting in fine regulation of promoters having binding sites for the hGABP complex. However, certain promoters may have a mechanism to select for the binding of either the hGABPα·hGABPβ complex or the hGABPα·hGABPγ complex, where other DNA-binding factors on other regions of the promoter may play an important role in recruiting either hGABP complex on the promoter as a transcriptional regulation partner. Such a mechanism of transcription regulation is analogous to that of the positive factor TFIIA and the repressors, Dr1 and Dr2. These factors bind to the basic region of the TATA box-binding protein competitively, resulting in transcription regulation (27Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ilho H. William S.L. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 28Merno A. Madder K.R. Lane W.S. Champoux J.J. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 365: 227-232Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar). As in the case of hGABPγ and the hGABP complex, some gene-specific transcription factors with DNA binding activity, including Ets family proteins, may have partners which antagonize their interaction with associated factors necessary for their transactivation activity. The K D value of hGABPβ and hGABPγ for hGABPα leads to the interpretation that most of the hGABPα protein present in the cell forms a complex with hGABPβ or hGABPγ, if their intracellular concentrations are taken into account. This notion is supported by the observation that these three factors can be co-purified from HeLa nuclear extracts using Sepharose beads bound to DNA containing the hGABP-binding sequence (10Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and that hGABPβ and hGABPγ are responsible for efficient hGABPα migration into the nucleus as observed by an immunofluorescence assay of the co-transfected cells (15Sawa C. Goto M. Suzuki F. Watanabe H. Sawada J.-i. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The DNA-protein interactions of hGABP were also characterized kinetically using the SPR system and the gel-shift assay as summarized in Table II. The binding affinity of hGABPα for its target sequence (K D of 15 ± 2.6 × 10−10m) is equivalent to that of p42/Ets-1 (K D of 36 × 10−10m) reported previously (29Fisher R.J. Fivash M. Casas-Finet J. Erickson J.W. Kondoh A. Bladen S.V. Fisher C. Watson D. Papas T. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This may reflect the conservation of the highly homologous DNA binding domain, termed the Ets domain, in both proteins. The DNA binding affinity of gene-specific transcription factors generally ranges from 10−8m to 10−11m (equilibrium dissociation constant). The affinity of their Ets domains for target sequences is lower than that of the D. melanogaster transcription factor,fushi-tarazu, which has a homeodomain for DNA binding, and whose K D was reported to be approximately 2.5 × 10−11m by the gel-shift assay (30Florence B. Handrow R. Laughon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3613-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the binding of hGABPγ to hGABPα stabilizes the DNA binding affinity of hGABPα because it imparts a slower dissociation rate. The interaction may lead to conformational change(s) in hGABPα. We observed that the binding did not result in faster association of hGABPα with its target sequence. Recently, Batchelor et al. (31Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. Brousse F.C. Mcknight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) reported structural analysis of the GABPα and GABPβ complex and showed that Lys69 of GABPβ makes an indirect contact with the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone via Glu321 of GABPα. This may explain the slower dissociation rate. As the result of such stability the hGABP complex may reside for longer periods at promoters containing its recognition site than hGABPα alone. These findings suggest the importance of the stability of DNA binding activity in addition to interactions between the transactivation domain and the RNA polymerase machinery for transcription activation. We are grateful to Drs. H. Yasui, S. Hashimoto, T. Natsume, T. Wada, and T. Imai for helpful discussions. The contribution of M. Ikeda and K. Tamai to the production of polyclonal antibodies against hGABPβ is gratefully acknowledged. We also thank all of our colleagues in the laboratory for helpful comments."

Madin-Darby canine kidney horseradish peroxidase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells is divided into two morphologically, functionally, and biochemically distinct cell surface domains. The maintenance of cell surface polarity requires the continuous sorting of newly synthesized and internalized membrane components. Once arrived at the trans-side of the Golgi apparatus, newly synthesized membrane proteins are sorted into cell surface transport pathways in a manner that can vary from one epithelial tissue to another and from one protein to another (1Nelson W.J. Science. 1992; 258: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 2Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 3Keller P. Simons K.

With one exception, all studied apical and basolateral membrane proteins are directly sorted to their respective cell surface domain in the Golgi apparatus in MDCK1cells. Apical sorting can be mediated by different types of determinants including transmembrane domains and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors as well as luminalN-linked and perhaps O-linked carbohydrates (5Brown D.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1919-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Basolateral targeting has been associated with cytoplasmic domain determinants that mediate direct basolateral transport in the Golgi apparatus as well as in endosomes (2Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 3Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins lacking apical and basolateral targeting determinants accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, indicating that efficient cell surface transport does not occur by default (10Gut A. Kappeler F. Hyka N. Balda M.S. Hauri H.-P. Matter K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1919-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In one clone of MDCK cells, polarization of Na+K+-ATPase is mediated by selective basolateral stabilization after delivery to both cell surface domains (11Hammerton R.W. Krzeminski K.A. Mays R.W. Ryan T.A. Wollner D.A. Nelson W.J. Science. 1991; 254: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The apical pool of Na+K+-ATPase does not become transcytosed but is degraded, as seen during the repolarization of MDCK cells in calcium switch experiments (12Contreras R.G. Avila G. Gutierrez C. Bolivar J.J. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Darzon A. Beaty G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Cereijido M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C896-C905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although nonpolarized cell surface transport occurs only in a mutant MDCK cell line deficient in glycolipid sorting, the steady-state polarity of Na+K+-ATPase seems to be enhanced by selective basolateral stabilization also in wild-type MDCK cells (13Caplan M.J. Anderson H.C. Palade G.E. Jamieson J.D. Cell. 1986; 46: 623-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Mays R.W. Siemers K.A. Fritz B.A. Lowe A.W. van Meer G. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Integrins are functionally important basolateral membrane proteins composed of an α subunit and a β subunit (15Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref Scopus (1652) Google Scholar, 16Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref Scopus (2553) Google Scholar). MDCK cells express a variety of different α and β subunits (17Schoenenberger C.-A. Zuk A. Zinkl G.M. Kendall D. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 527-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ojakian G.K. Schwimmer R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 561-576PubMed Google Scholar). β1 seems to be the predominant β subunit and is involved in the formation of functional receptors for different extracellular matrix components as well as in the determination of the spatial orientation of polarized epithelial cells (18Ojakian G.K. Schwimmer R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 561-576PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schwimmer R. Ojakian G.K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2487-2498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zuk A. Matlin K. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1875-1889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We studied basolateral sorting of the human α5β1 integrin in stably transfected MDCK cells, which was basolaterally expressed in the steady state. The cytoplasmic domains of both subunits were found to be able to mediate the basolateral sorting of dimeric integrins as well as that of a chimeric reporter protein independently from one another but exhibited different capacities. Unlike other basolateral sorting signals, the presence of the cytoplasmic domains of α5 and/or β1 did not result in direct basolateral targeting, but in stabilization of the basolateral pool after transport to both cell surface domains. MDCK strain II cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) as described previously (21Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). For polarity experiments, the cells were cultured for 5–8 days on tissue culture-treated polycarbonate filters (Costar Transwells) with a pore size of 0.4 μm and a diameter of 24 mm (for biochemical assays) or 12 mm (for immunofluorescence). The cDNAs coding for human α5 and β1(generously provided by Dr. E. Ruoslahti, La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA) were cloned into Bluescript SK+and into the eukaryotic expression vectors pCB7 (α5; selectable with hygromycin) or pCB6 (β1; selectable with G418). α5CT9 and β1CT10 were constructed using the Bluescript constructs and PCR-based mutagenesis to introduce premature stop codons. Fc receptor chimeras were constructed as described previously using a modified FcRII-B2 cDNA coding for the apically expressed tail-minus receptor with a AflII site just before the stop codon (21Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of α5 (amino acids 3–28, resulting in FcR-α5:3-28) or β1 (amino acids 11–47, resulting in FcR-β1:11-47) with aAflII and a XbaI site were synthesized and cloned into the Fc receptor cDNA in pCB6. These two cDNAs were then used to construct chimeras with modified cytoplasmic domains using primers with 5′ XbaI sites for cloning. All constructs were sequenced over the entire subcloned PCR-derived fragment by dideoxy sequencing. MDCK cells were transfected and selected using G418 (pCB6) or hygromycin (pCB7), respectively (21Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). For double transfections, stable cell lines were first generated expressing either wild-type or truncated human β1. These cell lines were then used to co-express α5 cDNAs. Single clones were picked and analyzed for expression by immunofluorescence. At least three clones and an uncloned cell line (derived from a pool of the nonpicked clones) were grown and analyzed for all transfections. Transfected cells were cultured on filters for 5–8 days and then fixed with or without an overnight preincubation with 10 mm sodium butyrate. To label chimeric Fc receptors with a polyclonal antibody (22Green S.A. Plutner H. Mellman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9867-9874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human α5 with monoclonal antibody P1D6 (Life Technologies, Inc.), the cells were fixed for 20 min; to label human β1 with monoclonal antibody P4C10 (Life Technologies, Inc.), the cells were fixed for 60 min with 3% paraformaldehyde. The long fixation for the β1 staining eliminated background staining due to endogenous β1 if the primary antibody was sufficiently diluted (1:8000; each batch was newly titrated). The samples were then blocked and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% saponin, 10 mm glycine, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% sodium azide (23Balda M.S. Whitney J.A. Flores C. González S. Cereijido M. Matter K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1031-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in the same solutions, and the incubations were performed for 60 min at room temperature. In some experiments, cell surface chimeras were labeled by incubating the unfixed cells with primary antibody diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.5 mmCaCl2 added from both sides of the filter culture for 2 h on ice (24Matter K. Balda M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 511-519PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy as described previously (23Balda M.S. Whitney J.A. Flores C. González S. Cereijido M. Matter K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1031-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Filter-grown MDCK cells were metabolically labeled for 20 min with [35S]methionine/35S-cysteine, chased for different periods of time, and selectively biotinylated (25Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The biotinylated cells were solubilized with extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 1% Empigen BB, 10 mm glycine, and 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 ml/filter). The extracts were left on ice for 30 min and then spun in a microfuge for 15 min at 4 °C. The human integrin subunits were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibodies linked to protein A-Sepharose via a rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody, and the chimeras were immunopurified with the rabbit anti-Fc receptor antibody (21Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). After washing, the immunocomplexes were dissociated, and each precipitate was divided into three samples: (a) one sample was fractionated on a SDS gel, and radioactively labeled protein was visualized by fluorography; (b) another sample was diluted, reprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose, and then analyzed by electrophoresis and fluorography; and (c) the third sample was fractionated on a SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then probed with streptavidin-HRP. For the determination of the half-lives of proteins in the apical and the basolateral cell surface domains, cells were cooled on ice, and one of the two cell surface domains was biotinylated as described above. After incubating the cells for different periods of time at 37 °C in normal tissue culture medium, the samples were extracted, and the transfected protein(s) was immunoprecipitated. The precipitates were fractionated on SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the presence of biotinylated protein was tested using streptavidin-HRP and ECL. The steady-state distribution of Fc receptors was determined using a modified antibody-binding assay (21Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Filter-grown MDCK cells expressing chimeras were incubated with the polyclonal antibody against the Fc receptor (diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.5 mm CaCl2) from either the apical or the basolateral side on ice for 2 h (the opposite side contained buffer alone). The cells were then washed and incubated for another 2 h in the same way with a HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. After washing, the filters were excised from the holders and transferred to phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, and HRP was assayed colorimetrically (26Miettinen H.M. Matter K. Hunziker W. Rose J.K. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 875-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). MDCK cells endogenously express several different integrins, but β1 seems to be the most prominent β subunit (17Schoenenberger C.-A. Zuk A. Zinkl G.M. Kendall D. Matlin K.S. J.

We therefore decided to use human β1 and α5for the targeting studies; these two subunits can dimerize together, forming a receptor for fibronectin, and the human α5subunit can easily be specifically detected because MDCK cells do not seem to express significant amounts of the α5 integrin subunit (17Schoenenberger C.-A. Zuk A. Zinkl G.M. Kendall D. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 527-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To reconstitute this human integrin in MDCK cells, we first generated stable cell lines expressing human β1. This resulted in several clones that all expressed the human integrin subunit in the basolateral membrane (data not shown). We chose two homogeneously expressing clones into which we transfected a cDNA coding for human α5. Cell lines expressing the two human integrin subunits were then cultured on filters for 5 days to allow full polarization, and the polarity of expression was then studied by immunofluorescence combined with confocal microscopy. Because both the anti-α5 and anti-β1 antibodies are derived from mouse, we stained separate cultures for the two subunits. Fig. 1 A shows confocal sections obtained from monolayers preincubated overnight with sodium butyrate and then labeled with the two integrin antibodies. In both cases, very little apical staining could be detected, but the lateral and the basal plasma membranes were efficiently labeled. When nontransfected MDCK cells were labeled with the two antibodies under the same conditions, no staining could be detected (the anti-β1 antibody showed some staining in cells that were gently fixed for 15 min, but not if the cells were fixed as described here for 60 min). Basolateral expression of the two subunits was also obtained when they were separately transfected (data not shown). The cell surface expression in such single transfections was lower, and the β1 subunit could be detected accumulating in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that the expression of only one subunit did not result in efficient cell surface transport due to insufficient amounts of partners for dimerization. Although this suggests that the two transfected subunits dimerized together, it could also be that at least a fraction of the transfected subunits was transported to the cell surface in association with an endogenous integrin subunit. As shown below, however, co-expressed subunits can determine the polarity of each other's cell surface distribution, indicating that in the steady state, the vast majorities of co-transfected human integrin subunits must be dimerized with one another. Because basolateral sorting of several membrane proteins has been shown to depend on distinct cytoplasmic targeting determinants, we constructed C-terminally truncated α5 and β1 integrin subunits lacking most of the cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 2: α5CT9 and β1CT10) and generated stable cell lines co-expressing the two mutant subunits. Filter-grown cells preincubated overnight with sodium butyrate were fluorescence labeled using either the anti-α5 or the anti-β1 monoclonal antibody and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Fig. 1 B shows that both antibodies efficiently stained the apical membrane of MDCK cells expressing human α5 and β1 integrin subunits lacking their cytoplasmic domains (α5CT9 and β1CT10), and only a little staining of the basolateral cell surface was detected. Thus, one or both of the cytoplasmic domains are required for basolateral expression of human α5β1 integrin in MDCK cells. Furthermore, the absence of cytoplasmic basolateral sorting information results in the preferential apical expression of the integrin, as in the case of many monomeric membrane proteins (2Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We next co-expressed mutant α5 and β1subunits with the corresponding wild-type subunit to test whether one or both of the cytoplasmic domains are required for basolateral expression; if only one was required, we tested to see which one. In cells expressing wild-type α5 and β1CT10, both antibodies resulted in efficient basolateral labeling with little apical fluorescence (Fig. 1 C), indicating that the α5 cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to mediate basolateral expression. Cells expressing wild-type β1 and α5CT9 were labeled by both antibodies on both cell surface domains (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain of β1 also mediates basolateral expression, but at an apparently lower efficiency than the cytoplasmic domain of α5. These experiments also demonstrated that one transfected subunit could efficiently redirect the other one, indicating that most of the integrin staining we observed must have been due to the transfected human α5 and β1dimerized with each other. This is also supported by the observation that efficient apical expression was not observed when the cells were transfected with either one of the mutant subunits alone (data not shown). It is important to note that expression of mutant integrin subunits did not negatively affect MDCK cells. We could not detect decreases in transepithelial electrical resistance, indicating that the transfected cells were still forming electrically tight monolayers, and the cells did not show any obvious morphological alterations when observed by electron microscopy after embedding in Epon and thin sectioning (data not shown). Because integrin affinity to the ligand can be affected by mutations in the cytoplasmic domains, it could be that the deletions of the cytoplasmic domains caused a redistribution due to the effects on substrate binding. The effects of mutations that we observed on the polarized cell surface distribution, however, do not correlate with the known effects on affinity (27Hughes P. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To test a direct involvement of the integrin cytoplasmic domains in basolateral sorting, we linked the entire cytoplasmic tail of α5 (amino acids 1–28) or the region of β1 required for basolateral expression of the integrin (amino acids 11–47) to the transmembrane and extracytoplasmic domain of the mouse Fc receptor for IgG (Fig. 2), a protein that is apically expressed in the absence of a basolateral sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain (28Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We then generated stable MDCK cell lines expressing these chimeric constructs and analyzed polarized expression in filter-grown cells with an antibody recognizing the Fc receptor ectodomain. Fig. 3 shows confocal sections taken from such samples derived from cells treated with (A and B) or without (C) sodium butyrate. The chimera containing the cytoplasmic domain of α5 (Fig. 3 A) was basolaterally expressed, and only a little apical staining could be detected. The cytoplasmic domain of human α5 is thus sufficient to mediate basolateral expression of the reporter protein. When MDCK cells expressing the β1 Fc receptor chimera were analyzed, labeling of both cell surface domains could be detected after the induction of high expression levels by sodium butyrate (Fig. 3 B). The staining appeared heterogeneous: some cells were only basolaterally labeled, whereas other cells were fluorescent on both cell surface domains. Because random labeling seemed to coincide with more expression, we repeated the same experiment without induction with sodium butyrate. Indeed, primarily basolateral fluorescence was detected at low expression levels (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of β1 is also sufficient to mediate basolateral expression of the Fc receptor but seems to do so at a lower efficiency than that of α5. This is in agreement with the mixed cell surface polarity observed in cells co-expressing wild-type β1 and α5CT9 (Fig. 1 D). The apical expression of the β1 Fc receptor chimera at high expression levels could also have been due to a dominant negative effect of the integrin chimera causing a general defect in cell adhesion, as described for fibroblasts expressing a chimera containing the entire cytoplasmic domain of β1 (29Smilenov L. Briesewitz R. Marcantonio E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 31Lukashev M.E. Sheppard D. Pytela R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18311-18314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We could not detect negative effects on the monolayer morphology, the polarized expression of another basolateral membrane protein (Na+/K+-ATPase), or on the localization of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in cells expressing FcR-β1:11-47; such effects could easily be observed when a chimera containing the entire cytoplasmic domain of β1including the first 10 amino acids was expressed. We next introduced different deletions into the cytoplasmic domains of the α5 and β1 Fc receptor chimeras to map the regions in the cytoplasmic tails required for basolateral expression. We assayed the polarity of expression by binding the anti-Fc receptor antibody to either the apical or the basolateral cell surface domain of filter-grown transfected cells on ice. After washing, bound primary antibody was visualized with a secondary antibody conjugated to HRP and a colorimetric reaction. Fig. 3 D shows that 80% of the chimera containing the entire cytoplasmic domain of α5 was detected basolaterally, confirming the confocal images shown above. In contrast, C-terminal deletions of 19 or 11 amino acids, respectively, resulted in preferentially apically expressed chimeras (FcR-α5:3-9 and FcR-α5:3-17). In contrast, removal of the membrane proximal domain, which is conserved in all α subunits (32Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar), did not affect basolateral expression (FcR-α5:8-28). Thus, only the C-terminal part of the α5 cytoplasmic domain is required for basolateral expression of the chimeras. We then expressed a set of β1 Fc receptor chimeras and analyzed the polarity of expression without preincubation with sodium butyrate to avoid saturation. Fig. 3 E shows that C-terminal truncation also resulted in apical expression (FcR-β1:11-28 and FcR-β1:11-38), indicating that the C-terminal part of the β1 cytoplasmic domain is important for basolateral expression. Interestingly, substitution of tyrosine 44 by an alanine (FcR-β1:11-47Y-A44) reduced the polarity of expression (∼60% basolateral); hence, the tyrosine substitution resulted in only a partial inactivation of the basolateral sorting activity of the β1 cytoplasmic domain because the complete absence of basolateral sorting information results in preferential apical expression of Fc receptors (28Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, the last nine amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of β1 are important for basolateral expression, and tyrosine 44 is involved in this process. Cytoplasmic domain-mediated basolateral expression has thus far always been found to be achieved by direct transport from the Golgi apparatus to the basolateral cell surface, circumventing the apical plasma membrane domain (2Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To test whether the cytoplasmic domains of the human α5β1 integrin also mediate direct basolateral transport, we pulse-chase labeled transfected cells co-expressing wild-type α5β1 integrin and then biotinylated either the apical or the basolateral plasma membrane domain. After extraction, the human integrin was immunoprecipitated with the anti-α5 antibody. Each precipitate was then split into three samples: (a) the first sample was directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography to see the total labeled and immunoprecipitable integrin (i.e. newly synthesized integrin); (b) the second sample was reprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose to see the metabolically labeled biotinylated integrin (i.e. newly synthesized integrin at the cell surface); and (c) the third sample was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and biotinylated integrin was visualized with HRP-streptavidin and enhanced chemiluminescence to see the total biotinylated integrin (i.e. the steady-state cell surface distribution of human α5β1integrin). Fig. 4 A shows that α5 was synthesized as a higher molecular weight precursor (heaviest band at 0 min) and then processed and also started to co-immunoprecipitate β subunits. The total immunoprecipitated α5 appeared to increase with time, suggesting that the monoclonal antibody used in this experiment recognizes the mature forms more efficiently than the early forms, a common behavior of monoclonal antibodies that is often used to assay conformational maturation of proteins in the early secretory pathway (for examples, see Refs. 33Copeland C.S. Doms R.W. Bolzau E.M. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar and 34Matter K. Hauri H.-P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1916-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized integrin was detected on the cell surface after 60 min of chase (Fig. 4 A, surface 35S proteins) and started to appear at both cell surface domains in similar amounts. At longer times of chase, the integrin started to disappear from the apical cell surface, whereas it remained at the basolateral domain. Total biotinylated integrin exhibited a clear basolateral expression in all cultures, suggesting that the apical appearance was not due to preferential apical biotinylation or an inability of the antibody (or of the technique used) to immunoprecipitate basolateral integrin. If the immunoprecipitation was done with anti-β1 antibodies, the apical cell surface appearance was even more pronounced (Fig. 4 B). It is currently not clear what caused the difference in the amounts of apically detected integrin in Fig. 4 A and B, but it could be that a fraction of α5formed dimers with a relatively short half-life (and therefore did not influence the steady-state distribution) with an endogenous β subunit that, in contrast to β1, is able to mediate direct basolateral transport.

Each amino acid in the region (residues 162–173) between putative transmembrane helices IV and V of SGLT1 was replaced individually with Cys. Mutant proteins were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and studied using the two-electrode voltage clamp method. At certain key positions, Cys substitution resulted in 1) a change in the apparent affinity for sugar, 2) an alteration in the voltage dependence of the transient currents, and 3) a sensitivity to inhibition by either the ethylamine (MTSEA) or the ethylsulfonate MTS derivatives. For the three Cys mutants inhibited by MTSEA (F163C, A166C, and L173C), inhibition of steady state transport is related to changes in membrane potential-dependent transitions within the Na+/glucose transport cycle. MTSEA shifted the transient currents of these Cys mutants toward more negative membrane potentials (ΔV 0.5 = −18 mV for F163C and A166C, −12 mV for L173C). When the mutations were combined to produce double and triple Cys mutants, the degree to which the transient currents were shifted along the membrane potential axis by MTSEA correlated with the number of cysteines. In this way it was possible to manipulate the voltage dependence of the transient currents over a range spanning 91 mV. Examination of the Na+ dependence of the transient currents indicates that a 91-mV shift is equivalent to that caused by a 10-fold reduction in the external Na+ concentration. We conclude that this region has a role in determining the Na+binding- and voltage-sensing properties of SGLT1 and that it forms an α-helix with one surface possibly lining a Na+ pore within SGLT1.

The Na+/glucose cotransporter, SGLT1, utilizes the Na+ electrochemical gradient to drive transport of sugar across intestinal and renal brush border membranes.

The measurement of electrical currents carried by SGLT1 Na+ fluxes has confirmed the membrane potential dependence of Na+/glucose transport. In addition to SGLT1, many other cotransporters and exchangers that move cations such as Na+ and H+ across lipid bilayers have been found to demonstrate transport activities that are strongly influenced by membrane potential (9Bennett E.

Although the kinetics and ion dependences of the transient currents differ from transporter to transporter, the unifying concept is that the transient currents reflect an interaction between the cation and the transporter, and/or a conformational change that moves protein charges or dipoles across the membrane electric field. The sodium dependence, the effect of saturating concentrations of sugar and phlorizin, and the effect of temperature on the SGLT1 transient currents have all been studied (2Hazama A. Loo D.D.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) as arising from two transitions, namely the reorientation of the empty transporter within the membrane and a subsequent external Na+ binding event. The transient currents exhibited by SGLT1 have also been studied using the cut open oocyte method (25Taglialatela M. Toro L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which allows for an ultrafast voltage clamp and access to the intracellular ion concentrations. Using this technique, the transient currents were shown to arise from at least three transitions (26Chen X.Z. Coady M.J. Lapointe J.Y. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2544-2552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At present, the transient currents appear to arise from kinetically complex phenomena that relate either directly or indirectly to external Na+ binding events. In the present paper, we describe the results of a cysteine-scanning mutagenesis project of the region between putative transmembrane helices IV and V in which mutant transporters were analyzed using theX. laevis oocyte expression system. The ability of the mutant transporters to mediate Na+/glucose transport was assayed by using the two-electrode voltage clamp, and the sufficiently active mutants were tested for sensitivity to inhibition by the ethylamine and ethylsulfonate MTS1 derivatives MTSEA and MTSES, respectively. In previous reports, one of the mutants, A166C has already been characterized in detail using both the X. laevis oocyte system (27Lo B. Silverman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and the COS-7 cell system (28Vayro S. Lo B. Silverman M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The results of the present study demonstrate that while none of the residues in this region (residues 162–173) play an absolutely essential role in transport, some are located in close proximity to the pathway that extracellular sodium takes to its binding site in SGLT1. Indeed, the distribution of the cysteine mutants that were sensitive to MTS derivatives suggests that this region forms an α-helix, one surface of which lines a Na+ pore within SGLT1. We have also characterized the transient currents exhibited by the single cysteine mutants, F163C, A166C, and L173C, and then extended these studies by combining the mutations to construct multiple cysteine mutants. The results from the double and triple cysteine mutants demonstrate that it is possible to manipulate the membrane potential dependence of the transient currents exhibited by SGLT1 over a range as large as 91 mV. Collectively, our observations represent an important structural localization of a region of SGLT1 that is key in the membrane potential transitions that give rise to the transient currents. We hypothesize that these transitions include the external Na+ binding event and that the region 162–173 of SGLT1 defined by the various single and multiple cysteine mutants forms the pathway that external Na+ takes to reach its binding site. The multicloning site of the eukaryotic expression vector pMT3 (kindly provided by the Genetics Institute, Boston, MA) was removed by digestion with PstI and KpnI, and the cDNA of rabbit SGLT1 (kindly provided by M. A. Hediger) was subcloned into the remaining EcoRI site. The mutations were introduced into this construct using the megaprimer method of PCR mutagenesis (29Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) by making mutation-containing PCR products that were digested with BclI and then ligated to BclI-digested pMT3-SGLT1. The mutations and stretch of DNA between the two BclI sites were verified by dideoxy chain termination DNA sequencing. The DNA used for the oocyte injections was prepared using the QIAprep Spin Plasmid Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) without further purification. MTSES and MTSEA were obtained commercially (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada). X. laevis frogs were anaesthetized with a 0.17% solution of 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester in water. Stage V or VI oocytes were then surgically removed and digested with 2 mg/ml type IV collagenase (Sigma) prepared in modified Barth's saline (MBS) for 60–90 min. The composition of the MBS was 0.88 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm KCl, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 15.0 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 0.3 mm CaNO3, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 mg/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin. After the collagenase digestion, oocytes were kept in MBS overnight at 18 °C before being injected with the DNA. Using a Drummond Nanoject (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA), 4.7 nl of TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) containing 0.15 ng of mutant SGLT1 in pMT3 and 0.15 ng of secreted alkaline phosphatase in pMT3 was injected into the animal pole of the defolliculated oocytes as described previously by Swick et al. (30Swick A.G. Janicot M. Cherval-Kastelic T. McLenethan J.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The injected oocytes were kept in MBS supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate for 2–3 days before being transferred to 96-well plates to be incubated individually another 16–24 h. The incubation solution from each oocyte was then tested for alkaline phosphatase activity following the protocol of Tate et al. (31Tate S.S. Uraer R. Micanovic R. Gerber L. Underfriend S. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Oocytes that were positive according to this assay were then selected for the electrophysiology, which was conducted over the next 2 days. In all experiments, the oocyte currents were measured with the two-electrode voltage clamp techniques (8Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We used an Axoclamp-2A amplifier, TL-2 data acquisition system, and pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) to generate voltage pulses and measure the current responses. Oocytes with resting membrane potentials less negative than −30 mV were discarded. Microelectrode resistances ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 megaohms. During an experiment, the voltage-clamped oocyte was under the constant perfusion of buffer at approximately 2 ml/min. the composition of this uptake buffer was 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-Tris base (pH 7.4). Current responses to 100-ms voltage pulses were recorded at a sample rate of 2.5 ms−1as the average of the responses to three consecutive trials and were subjected to a 500-kHz, five-point Gaussian filter prior to curve fitting or the calculation of steady state parameters. In an oocyte expressing SGLT1, the total transient current response following a voltage pulse consists of 1) a nonspecific component and 2) an SGLT1-specific component that is inhibited by phlorizin. In all of our experiments, we isolated the SGLT1-specific transient currents by performing a point by point subtraction of the current response measured immediately before and after the addition of 0.2 mm phlorizin. The principle on which this analysis is based is that the nonspecific component, due mostly to oocyte membrane capacitance, is approximated by the total transient current response measured in the presence of a saturating concentration of phlorizin. Once the SGLT1-specific transient currents were isolated using the phlorizin subtraction method described above, to obtain theQ(V t) relationship, we first base line-corrected and then integrated the transient currents with respect to time. Typically, the transient currents were measured for a series of 100-ms test potentials (V t) ranging from −150 to +50 mV from a holding potential of −50 mV, and the base-line correction was done by subtracting the average values for the currents measured toward the end of these voltage pulses (between 95 and 99 ms). The integration of the SGLT1-specific transients that followed was always done over the entire duration of the voltage pulses (from 0 to 99 ms), and the Q(V t) relationships thus obtained were fitted to the Boltzmann distribution,QVt=Qmax/1+expVt−V0.5zF/RT−Qhyp(Eq. 1) where Q(V t) equals the charge that has moved in response to a voltage jump from the hyperpolarizing limit to V t, Q max corresponds to the maximal charge transfer, Q hyp isQ at the hyperpolarizing limit, V 0.5is the voltage at which the charge movements are half-completed,z is apparent valence, F is Faraday's constant,R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. Curve fitting was done using the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm (Origin 4.0, Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Each amino acid in the region between putative transmembrane helices IV and V, residues 162–173, was replaced individually with cysteine in wild type (WT) rabbit SGLT1 without prior removal of any of the 15 endogenous cysteines. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing, and except for the desired base changes, the sequence for all of the mutants between and including the BclI restriction enzyme sites was identical to WT. Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of SGLT1 showing the location of the single cysteine mutants. The schematic is based on a proposed secondary structure in which SGLT1 is composed of a short extracellular N terminus followed by 14 α-helical hydrophobic domains that traverse the membrane in zig-zag fashion (33Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The ability of the mutants to function as Na+/glucose cotransporters was assessed using the X. laevis oocyte expression system and the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The assay used to screen the mutants for function was a straightforward measurement of the currents induced by increasing concentrations of αMG, a nonmetabolizable SGLT1 sugar substrate. In Fig. 2 A, we show the results of a typical experiment with an oocyte expressing the L173C mutant. Here, the αMG concentration was systematically titrated from 0.025 to 1.0 mm, and at each concentration, the currents were measured as the membrane potential was stepped from −10 to −150 mV in increments of 20 mV. We show that these eight sets of data can be independently fitted to the Michaelis-Menten relationship,I = I max[αMG]/(K m + [αMG]). This illustrates that when the functional expression is sufficiently high, the steady state αMG-induced currents can be used to calculate an apparent αMGK m for the mutant transporter. From the kind of experiment described above, accurate determinations of an apparent αMG K m were made for the following eight mutants: F163C, A166C, I167C, F168C, Q170C, L171C, T172C, and L173C. Table I summarizes the apparent αMG K m for these cysteine mutants whenV = −50 mV. For three of the mutants (F163C, A166C, and T172C), the apparent affinities for αMG are significantly reduced compared with WT; for another three mutants (I167C, Q170C, and L173C), the affinities are relatively unchanged; and for another two mutants (F168C and L171C), the affinities are higher compared with WT. The remaining four mutants (I162C, S164C, G165C, I169C) exhibited measurable αMG-induced currents, but the levels of these currents were too small to allow for accurate determination of an apparent αMGK m. From titrations of αMG concentrations up to 10 mm αMG, the best that could be accomplished for these four mutants was an estimate of an upper bound to the apparent αMG affinity (<0.2 mm).Table IApparent Km (in mm) for αMG of the various single cysteine mutants at −50 mVMutantαMG apparentK mMutantαMG apparent K mI162C<0.2F168C0.055 ± 0.004F163C0.580 ± 0.038I169C<0.2S164C<0.2Q170C0.110 ± 0.013G165C<0.2L171C0.070 ± 0.016A166C0.905 ± 0.057T172C0.35 ± 0.041I167C0.150 ± 0.011L173C0.126 ± 0.012WT SGLT1 apparent K m is 0.150 ± 0.024 mm. Errors are S.D. values (n ≥ 3). Open table in a new tab WT SGLT1 apparent K m is 0.150 ± 0.024 mm. Errors are S.D. values (n ≥ 3). In Fig. 2 B we show the voltage dependence of the apparent αMG K m for several of the cysteine mutants. Q170C and L173C exhibit apparent K m versus V curves that are nearly identical to the one exhibited by WT SGLT1, whereas F163C and A166C demonstrate curves shifted significantly toward reduced apparent αMG affinities. In every case, the curves are invariant with respect to membrane potential at sufficiently negative membrane potentials, indicating that for these cysteine mutants the sugar binding step is membrane potential-independent. The low levels of αMG-induced currents exhibited by I162C, S164C, G165C, and I169C can be attributed to low levels of expression caused by the particular cysteine substitution. The possibility that the low current levels were due to poorly performed cDNA injections and/or unhealthy oocytes was ruled out for the following reasons: 1) the low levels of αMG-induced currents for oocytes injected with the four mutants were consistently low despite the fact that oocytes from the same batch injected with WT or another mutant cDNA demonstrated much larger currents, and 2) coinjection of cDNA encoding secreted alkaline phosphatase and the secreted alkaline phosphatase assay performed on the same or previous day demonstrated that the oocytes expressing poor αMG-induced currents at the same time were expressing high levels of secreted alkaline phosphatase. The low levels of αMG-induced currents are therefore probably a direct consequence of the cysteine mutation. Since the low levels of αMG-induced currents were accompanied by reduced amounts of charge movements (see “Charge Movements”), this further suggests that the four mutants I162C, S164C, G165C, and I169C are each expressing poor transport function, probably because they are not being properly trafficked to the plasma membrane. Such an interpretation is consistent with previous reports that charge movements of WT SGLT1 are correlated to plasma membrane expression levels (32Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Boorer K.J. Loo D.D. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and that many single amino acid substitutions elsewhere in the SGLT1 sequence do in fact lead to a trafficking defect in which the mutant protein is made at normal levels but poorly processed or never processed to the plasma membrane (10Wright E.M. Loo D.D. Turk E. Hirayama B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Wild type SGLT1 exhibits transient currents that are capacitive-like charge movements that occur in response to rapid changes in membrane potential. The integral of these transient currents represents a charge movement with a membrane potential dependence that follows a typical Boltzmann distribution. The most general molecular interpretation for the transient currents is that they are either 1) associated with a conformational change that moves protein charges or dipoles across the membrane electric field or 2) ion movements from the extracellular medium and to a binding site within the membrane electric field. As a secondary assay for screening the function of the various cysteine mutants, we measured the charge movements specific to the mutant transporters by voltage jump experiments in the absence and presence of saturating phlorizin (see “Materials and Methods”) and then fit theQ(V t) relationships thus obtained to the Boltzmann distribution. Table IIsummarizes the V 0.5 determined for 8 of the 12 cysteine mutants. We see that for F163C, A166C, F168C, and L173C, theV 0.5 is shifted toward more positive potentials and that for Q170C and L171C, the V 0.5 is shifted toward more negative potentials. In general terms, shifts in the Q(V t) relationship along the voltage axis are probably due to changes in one or more membrane potential transitions in the SGLT1 transport cycle. These transitions may be associated with the binding of extracellular Na+ and/or the reorientation of the empty transporter from inside facing to outside facing. The results indicate that the region where the cysteine substitutions were made (amino acids 162–173) has an important role to play in such membrane potential-dependent transitions.Table IIV0.5 of the various single cysteine mutantsMutantV 0.5MutantV 0.5I162CND2-aND, not determined.F168C24.1 ± 4.41F163C9.4 ± 0.6I169CNDS164CNDQ170C−11.7 ± 1.24G165CNDL171C−13.3 ± 2.2A166C19.53 ± 0.76T172C3.05 ± 1.55I167C2.71 ± 3.40L173C23.6 ± 3.20Values were obtained from fitting theQ(V t) curves to the Boltzmann relationship.

WT SGLT1 V 0.5 = −2.54 ± 0.7 mV. Errors are S.D. values (n ≥ 3). We note that, as with the αMG-induced currents, the low expression levels precluded an accurate determination of theV 0.5 for the remaining four mutants, I162C, I169C, G165C, and S164C, although phlorizin-inhibitable transient currents were clearly detectable in every case. For the eight cysteine mutants that demonstrated significant αMG-induced currents, we also tested whether introduction of the cysteine would allow the sulfydryl-reactive compound MTSEA or MTSES to inhibit transporter function. Neither compound has any effect on either the steady-state transport kinetics or transient currents exhibited by WT SGLT1, and the experiments were carried out in anticipation that some of the cysteines had been introduced into positions that were not only accessible to the MTS reagents but also in close enough proximity to functionally critical residues that their own chemical modification would lead to an alteration in transporter function. The functional screen consisted of first adding αMG to the buffer perfusing the oocyte and then, while measuring the αMG-induced currents, adding either 1 mmMTSEA or MTSES to the buffer. For WT, I167C, L171C, and T172C, there was no obvious inhibition of the αMG-induced currents by either MTS reagent; for F163C, A166C, and L173C there was a dramatic and rapid inhibition of the currents by 1 mm MTSEA but not 1 mm MTSES; for Q170C, there was equally dramatic and rapid inhibition with 1 mm MTSES but not 1 mm MTSEA. In Fig. 3 A, the time course of inhibition of currents mediated by F163C, A166C, and L173C by MTSEA is shown, illustrating that the reaction with MTSEA is complete within 1–2 min. The MTSES inhibition time course for Q170C-mediated currents is qualitatively very similar (Fig. 3 B). The results of the MTS functional screen foc"
https://openalex.org/W2051976853,"A 26-amino acid sequence in an extracellular loop of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit between membrane-spanning segments 7 and 8 has been shown to bind to the β subunit of Na,K-ATPase and to promote αβ assembly (Lemas, M. V., Hamrick, M., Takeyasu, K., and Fambrough, D. M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 8255–8259) When this 26-amino acid sequence of the rat Na,K-ATPase α3 subunit was replaced by the corresponding sequence of the rat gastric H,K-ATPase α subunit, the chimeric α subunit assembled preferentially with the rat gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit (Wang, S.-G., Eakle, K. A., Levenson, R., and Farley, R. A. (1997)Am. J. Physiol. 272, C923–C930). In the present study, these 26 amino acids (Asn886–Ala911) of rat Na,K-ATPase α3 were replaced by the corresponding amino acids Asn908–Ala933 of rat distal colon H,K-ATPase. Site-directed mutagenesis of the chimeric α subunits and Na,K-ATPase α3 showed that Val904, Tyr898, and Cys908 in the Na,K-ATPase α3 subunit are key residues in αβ subunit interactions. The V904Q mutation in Na,K-ATPase α3 reduced the B max for ouabain binding and the ATPase activity of α3β1 complexes by ∼95%, and Y898R reduced theB max and ATPase activity by ∼60%. The complementary mutations Q904V and R898Y increased the amount of ouabain bound by yeast membranes expressing the chimera with the colon H,K-ATPase sequence. The amount of ouabain bound by complexes assembled between Na,K-ATPase α3 containing the Y898R,C908G mutations and gastric H,K-ATPase β was less than 10% of wild type Na,K-ATPase α3 expressed with the same β subunit. The R898Y,G908C mutations in the chimeric α subunits also increased ouabain binding. A 26-amino acid sequence in an extracellular loop of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit between membrane-spanning segments 7 and 8 has been shown to bind to the β subunit of Na,K-ATPase and to promote αβ assembly (Lemas, M. V., Hamrick, M., Takeyasu, K., and Fambrough, D. M. (1994) J. Biol.

In the present study, these 26 amino acids (Asn886–Ala911) of rat Na,K-ATPase α3 were replaced by the corresponding amino acids Asn908–Ala933 of rat distal colon H,K-ATPase.

The R898Y,G908C mutations in the chimeric α subunits also increased ouabain binding. Na,K-ATPase H,K-ATPase rat Na,K-ATPase α3 subunit with amino acids Asn886–Ala911 replaced by amino acids Gln905–Val930 of rat gastric H,K-ATPase α subunit rat Na,K-ATPase α3 subunit with amino acids Asn886–Ala911 replaced by amino acids Asn908–Ala933 of rat colon H,K-ATPase α subunit P-type ATPases are those ion-transporting ATPases that are phosphorylated transiently by ATP as part of the catalytic mechanism. This class of ion-motive ATPase, including Na,K-ATPase (NK),1 H,K-ATPase (HK), and Ca-ATPase, is distributed widely throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. All of these ion pumps contain a large catalytic α subunit with a molecular mass between 70 and 200 kDa, and the potassium-transporting ATPases such as HK and NK also require a second, smaller glycosylated β subunit (30–55 kDa) for their enzymatic functions. The α subunit has multiple transmembrane segments and contains all of the amino acids thus far identified with the enzymatic functions of ATP hydrolysis and cation transport. The β subunit is a glycoprotein with one transmembrane segment and most of its mass located on the noncytoplasmic side of the membrane. The role of the β subunit in active ion transport is not fully understood. Lemas et al. (1Lemas M.V. Hamrick M. Takeyasu K. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have identified 26 amino acids in NKα, predicted to be located in an extracellular loop between transmembrane segments 7 and 8, which mediate interactions between α and β subunits. These 26 amino acids correspond to Asn886–Ala911 of the rat NKα3 subunit. Wanget al. (2Wang S.-G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) examined αβ assembly using a chimeric α subunit (NGH26) formed by replacement of Asn886–Ala911 of rat NKα3 with the corresponding amino acids Gln905–Val930 of rat gastric HKα. When NGH26 was expressed in yeast cells with HKβ, the number of ouabain binding sites was the same as for NKα3 expressed with either NKβ1 or HKβ. In contrast, only about 10% as many complexes were formed between NGH26 and NKβ1. Wang et al.concluded that some amino acids within the sequence Gln905–Val930 of rat gastric HKα probably destabilize αβ complexes formed with NKβ, leading to a reduction in the number of steady-state pumps. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that a chimeric α subunit with amino acids 1–519 from NKα and amino acids 519–1033 from gastric HKα did not form stable complexes with NKβ1 (3Gottardi C. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike gastric HKα, other HKα subunits do not appear to discriminate between different β subunits. For example, functional pumps are assembled between a distal colon HKα subunit and either NKβ1 or HKβ subunits. Codina et al. (4Codina J. Kone B.C. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29759-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that86Rb uptake into Xenopus oocytes increased when colon HKα was expressed with either NKβ1 or gastric HKβ, and Cougnon et al. (5Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7277-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) observed an increase in the86Rb uptake rate of oocytes injected with cRNA for colon HKα and an amphibian HKβ. A human HKα subunit (ATP1AL1) with 86% amino acid sequence identity to rat colon HKα was cloned by Modyanovet al. (6Modyanov N.N. Mathews P.M. Grishin A.V. Beguin P. Beggah A.T. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C992-C997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who observed that any of several different β subunits could be coimmunoprecipitated with ATP1AL1 when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Expression of rabbit gastric HKβ with ATP1AL1 in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a 3-fold increase in86Rb uptake compared with uninjected cells (7Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13740-13748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify amino acids that are involved in interactions between the α and β subunits, a new chimeric α subunit (NCH26) was made by replacing the 26-amino acid sequence Asn886–Ala911 of the rat NKα3 subunit with the corresponding sequence Asn908–Ala933 of rat distal colon HK α subunit. A series of mutations was introduced into NKα3 or the chimeric NGH26 and NCH26 subunits, and the presence of functional αβ complexes was measured by ouabain binding or ATPase activity after expression of the α polypeptides in yeast with either NKβ1 or gastric HKβ. Stability of the complexes was estimated from the ability of each αβ complex to bind ouabain at elevated temperatures. As a result of these measurements, Val904, Tyr898, and Cys908 in NKα3 have been identified as important amino acids for assembly of α subunits and β subunits. The plasmid pRD-CHK containing the cDNA of the rat colon HK α subunit was a gift of Dr. Gary Shull (University of Cincinnati). A 102-base pair fragment of pRD-CHK, encoding positions 2711–2812, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and ClaI and HpaI restriction sites were introduced at the same time. For construction of plasmid pNCH26m, the polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with ClaI and HpaI and was ligated into the corresponding region of clone pNGH26m (2Wang S.-G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) whoseClaI-HpaI fragment (79 base pairs) had been removed. Three mutations (N886D, 2Mutations are expressed as residue number flanked on the left by the original amino acid and on the right by the new amino acid. The α subunit in which the mutations were made is shown separated from the amino acid by a slash (/).A911V, and F912N), resulting from the introduction of ClaI and HpaI sites, were corrected by polymerase chain reaction. The resultant plasmid pNCH26 encodes the rat NKα3 subunit with the region (Asn886–Ala911) replaced by the 26 amino acids (Asn908–Ala933) of the rat colon HKα subunit. The AflII-BglII fragment (1,486 base pairs) of the yeast expression plasmid YEpNGH26 (2Wang S.-G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was replaced by the corresponding AflII-BglII fragment of pNCH26. The final plasmid (YEpNCH26) was analyzed by restriction digestion and by DNA sequencing. Mutations in the cDNA were made using the polymerase chain reaction, as described previously (2Wang S.-G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used to perform the site-directed mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants were screened by restriction enzymes and were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The yeast strain 30-4 (MAT α, trp1, ura3, Vn2, GAL+) obtained from R. Hitzeman (Genentech, South San Francisco) was transformed with different combinations of the chimeric α subunit or α mutant expression plasmid and one of the β subunit expression plasmids pG1T-Rβ1 and pG1T-HKβ (9Eakle K.A. Kim K.S. Wang S.-G. Farley R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2834-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) by the method of Elble (8Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). After identification of transformants containing α and β subunits on selective medium, frozen glycerol stocks from four different clones were made and were stored at −80 °C. Cultures for experiments described in this report were started from these glycerol stocks. A membrane fraction of transformed yeast cells was prepared as described previously (9Eakle K.A. Kim K.S. Wang S.-G. Farley R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2834-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Membranes were extracted with 0.1% (w/v) SDS as described previously (10Eakle K.A. Kabalin M.A. Wang S.-G. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6550-6557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ouabain binding to yeast membranes was done as described previously (2Wang S.-G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J.

To determine the number of steady-state pump complexes (B max) and the ouabain dissociation constant (K d), binding data were fit by a self-competition model (11Johnson C.L. Schultheis P.J.

For determination of the effects of heat on αβ stability, 3 mg of yeast microsomal membrane protein was dissolved in 400 μl of 25 mm imidazole-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (sodium-free), pH 7.4, and was heated at different temperatures (40–50 °C) for 90 s. Membranes were placed in ice for 15–30 min, and the amount of ouabain bound at 37 °C was measured. The amount of ouabain bound by membranes without heating was used as 100%.Figure 7Heat inactivation of ouabain binding. Upper panel, NKα3 and related mutants expressed with NKβ1. Lower panel, NKα3 and related mutants expressed with gastric HKβ. 3 mg of yeast membranes containing different αβ complexes were heated at different temperatures (40–50 °C) for 90 s, and then the amount of ouabain binding was determined in quadruplicate at 37 °C by incubation with 20 nm[3H]ouabain, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Pi, pH 7.5.

The blots were first incubated with monoclonal antibody α5 (D. Fambrough, Johns Hopkins University), then incubated with the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem). The α subunits were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) and nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma). The density of each α band was determined by scanning with a Bio-Rad scanner (Imaging Densitometer, model GS-670). The average of the expression levels of NCH26 + NKβ1 and NCH26 + HKβ with three different clones was determined and compared with the NKα3 + NKβ1 and NKα3 + HKβ controls. NK activity was determined in triplicate by measuring ouabain-inhibitable phosphate release, as described previously (12Eakle K.A. Lyu R.-M. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13937-13947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The sequence Asn886–Ala911 of rat NKα3 was replaced by the corresponding sequence Asn908–Ala933 of rat colon HKα, and this chimeric α subunit NCH26 was expressed in yeast cells with either NKβ1 and gastric HKβ. Fig. 1 A shows an immunoblot of membranes prepared from three different clones expressing either NKα3 or NCH26 with either NKβ1 or HKβ. Three clones expressing only NKα3 are also shown. Because the antibody α5 recognizes the same epitope on both NKα3 and NCH26, the relative abundance of each α subunit can be compared directly. The abundance of NCH26 expressed with NKβ1 is 82 ± 19% of NKα3 expressed with NKβ1, and the amount of NCH26 expressed with HKβ is 87 ± 11% of NKα3 expressed with HKβ (Fig. 1 B). When expressed in the absence of a β subunit, NKα3 is present at only 10 ± 10% of NKα3 levels found with NKβ1. In the absence of the β subunit, the α subunit is degraded rapidly, and the higher steady-state abundance of α subunits expressed with either NKβ1 or HKβ reflects stabilization of the α subunit by association with a β subunit (13Geering K. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These results show that the steady-state level of NCH26 expressed in yeast with NKβ1 or HKβ is not significantly different from NKα3 (p > 0.05). Functional NCH26 + β complexes were quantitated by ouabain binding, and theB max and K d values for NKα3 or NCH26 expressed with different β subunits were determined for three different clones each. The results presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that functional complexes are formed equally well in yeast between NKα3 and either NKβ or HKβ. Although the NCH26 polypeptide is present at the same level as NKα3, fewer functional complexes are formed between NCH26 and either NKβ1 or HKβ than with NKα3. Yeast membranes containing NCH26 + NKβ1 form about 40% of the number of functional pumps as NKα3 + NKβ1, and the number of functional NCH26 + HKβ complexes is about 20% of NKα3 + HKβ. The K d for ouabain binding by NCH26 + NKβ1 is 50 ± 13 nm, and for NCH26 + HKβ it is 206 ± 95 nm. These values are 8- and 27-fold higher than the K d values of NKα3 + NKβ1 (6 ± 2 nm) and NKα3 + gHKβ (7 ± 3 nm), respectively. The number of ouabain-binding complexes formed by NCH26 and HKβ is only 20–40% of the number formed by either NKα3 + HKβ or NGH26 + HKβ (2Wang S.-G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result might be explained if residues within the sequence Asn908–Ala933 of rat colon HKα are less suitable for assembly with gastric HKβ than corresponding residues of rat NKα3 or rat gastric HKα. A comparison of the amino acid sequences Asn886–Ala911 of rat NKα3, Gln905–Val930 of rat gastric HKα, and Asn908–Ala933 of rat colon HKα shows that the three sequences have identical residues or conservative substitutions in all positions except at amino acids 898, 908, and 909. In both NKα3 and rat gastric HKα, a tyrosine or a phenylalanine is located at position 898, and a cysteine is located at position 908. In rat colon HKα these residues are arginine and glycine, respectively. In position 909, the amino acids are different for all three sequences. To see whether the amino acids in positions 898 and 908 are important for the assembly with HKβ, mutations R898Y and/or G908C were introduced into NCH26, and the amount of ouabain bound by the mutants expressed in yeast with different β subunits was measured. The maximum amount of ouabain bound (B max) by the R898Y, G908C, and R898Y,G908C mutants of NCH26 expressed in yeast cells with either NKβ1 or gastric HKβ was used to indicate the number of functional αβ complexes (Fig. 3). The mutation R898Y increases the B max of NCH26 + NKβ1 complexes to the same value as NKα3 + NKβ1. When expressed with HKβ, the B max of the R898Y mutant increases 2.7 times higher than that of NCH26 + HKβ but is still less than that of NKα3 + HKβ. The mutation G908C does not affect the number of NCH26 + NKβ1 complexes. When expressed with HKβ, however, the mutation G908C reduces the B max of NCH26 from 22% to 3% of NKα3 + HKβ. When the two mutations R898Y and G908C are made in NCH26, the B max for ouabain binding is the same as NKα3 + HKβ (p > 0.05), and is 1.8 times higher than that of NCH26/R898Y + HKβ. Wang et al.studied the chimeric NGH26 α subunit and concluded that amino acids of gastric HKα between Gln905 and Val930interact more stably with the extracellular domain of HKβ than NKβ (2Wang S.-G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Charged amino acids have been implicated in the assembly of some membrane proteins (14Cramer W.A. Engelman D.M. von Heijne G. Rees D.C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3397-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Cosson P. Lankford S.P. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 351: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and within the 26 residues that were exchanged during chimera formation, the charged amino acids Lys902 and Glu905 are conserved among all of the NKα subunits and also in the colon HKα subunits. In the gastric HKα subunits, these amino acids are leucine and glutamine, respectively. Because NGH26 forms fewer functional pumps with NKβ1 than with HKβ, charged residues in positions 902 and 905 may be important for interactions between α subunits and NKβ1. To test this possibility, the mutations L902K and Q905E were introduced separately or together into NGH26, and the α subunits were expressed in yeast with either NKβ1 or HKβ. Only the Q905E mutation reduced the ouabain binding capacity of yeast membranes containing the mutant α subunits assembled with HKβ (p < 0.05). Introduction of the double mutation (NGH26-KE), however, restored the binding capacity and reduced the K d for ouabain binding by NGH26 from 72.7 to 23 nm (Table I).Table IOuabain binding affinity and binding capacity of α subunits expressed with HKβα Subunit and mutationK dB maxnmpmol/mgNKα3 None8.1 ± 2.33.4 ± 1.1NGH26 None72.7 ± 17.12.0 ± 0.3 L902K97.8 ± 31.81.5 ± 0.3 Q905E72.8 ± 19.80.6 ± 0.1 L902K,Q905E23.0 ± 6.31.8 ± 0.2Ouabain binding to yeast membranes containing either NKα3 + HKβ or NGH26 + HKβ was done as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mutations made in the NGH26 chimeric α subunit are indicated.

Open table in a new tab Ouabain binding to yeast membranes containing either NKα3 + HKβ or NGH26 + HKβ was done as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mutations made in the NGH26 chimeric α subunit are indicated. The ouabain binding affinity (dissociation constant (Kd, in nm) and maximum amount of ouabain bound (B max, in pmol/mg protein) were determined from a fit to the data by a single-site self-competition model (11Johnson C.L.

Although the mutations L902K and Q905E make the amino acid sequence of NGH26 more nearly like that of NKα3, the number of pumps is not increased above the NGH26 + NKβ1 level. This may be a result of the presence in NGH26 and NGH26-KE of amino acids whose side chains are sterically or electrostatically incompatible with assembly with NKβ1or because of the absence in these α subunits of amino acids whose side chains are important for specific interactions with NKβ1. There are 10 amino acid differences between the NKα3 sequence and NGH26-KE (Fig. 4). Each of these amino acids was changed in NGH26-KE, either individually or in pairs, to those amino acids in NKα3, and ouabain binding was used to identify amino acids that are important for assembly of NKα3 with NKβ1. Yeast membranes containing the α subunit mutants derived from NGH26-KE together with either NKβ1 or gastric HKβ were equilibrated with 20 nm [3H]ouabain, and specific binding was measured as before. As shown in Fig. 5, when the double mutation Y903V,Q904V is made in NGH26-KE and this mutant α subunit is expressed with NKβ1, yeast membranes bind 10 times more ouabain than when NGH26-KE is expressed with NKβ1. In addition, the double mutation Y903V,Q904V in NGH26-KE increases the amount of ouabain bound by when expressed in yeast with HKβ. The amount of ouabain bound by the rest of the mutants when expressed with either NKβ1 or HKβ is not significantly different from that of NGH26-KE + NKβ or NGH26-KE + HKβ (p > 0.05), respectively. The mutations Y903V,Q904V in the chimera NGH26-KE and R898Y,G908C in the chimera NCH26 lead to large increases in the amount of ouabain bound by yeast membranes containing these chimeric α subunits and either NKβ1 or HKβ. These increases could be due to changes in the affinity of the mutants for ouabain and/or to increased stability of the αβ complexes. If amino acids in positions 898, 903, 904, and/or 908 participate in interactions between α and β subunits, then the reverse mutations in NKα should reduce the amount of ouabain bound by yeast membranes expressing each αβ complex. Thus, the mutations V904Q, Y898R, C908G, and Y898R,C908G were made in NKα3 and the ouabain binding affinity and capacity of each αβ complex were measured after isolation of yeast membranes. Non-polar amino acid side chains are conserved among NKα subunits in position 904 but not in position 903, and so the effect of amino acid substitutions in position 903 was not tested. The left panel of Fig. 6 shows the B maxvalues of the NKα3 mutants expressed with NKβ1, and the right panel shows the B max values for NKα3 mutants expressed with HKβ. The B max of NKα3/V904Q + NKβ1 is only 5% of the B maxfor NKα3 + NKβ1, and the B max of NKα3/V904Q + HKβ is 18% of NKα3 + HKβ, confirming that Val904 is important for the functional assembly of NKα with both β subunits. The B max of NKα3/Y898R + NKβ1 is 42% of NKα3 + NKβ1, and theB max of NKα3/Y898R + HKβ is not significantly different from that of NKα3 + HKβ. For the mutation C908G in NKα3, no significant increase or decrease in the number of αβ complexes was seen when assembled with either subunit. Even though the individual mutation Y898R or C908G has no significant effect on the number of NKα3 + HKβ complexes, the double mutation Y898R,C908G was associated with a reduction in theB max for ouabain binding to about 10% of NKα3 + HKβ levels. Table II shows that for the V904Q mutation, no change in ouabain affinity was observed when the mutant NKα3 subunit was expressed with either NKβ1 or HKβ.Table IIOuabain binding affinities of NKα3 and NKα3-related mutants expressed with NKβ1 or HKβMutationNKβ1HKβnmnmNone6.1 ± 1.77.5 ± 3.2Y898R13.0 ± 5.449.6 ± 6.3C908G11.2 ± 2.733.5 ± 1.5Y898R,C908G77.6 ± 8.495.1 ± 50.5V904Q3.5 ± 1.56.8 ± 2.0The K d values (nm) were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values are shown as means ± S.D.

Yeast membranes containing the different α + NKβ1 complexes were extracted with SDS (16Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 36-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) to see whether reduction in the number of pump complexes caused by mutation of residues in NKα3 is accompanied by a similar reduction in ATPase activity. When expressed with NKβ1, the ATPase activities of the mutants V904Q, Y898R, C908G, and the double mutant Y898R,C908G were reduced to the same extent as theB max values (Table III). As shown previously (9Eakle K.A. Kim K.S. Wang S.-G. Farley R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2834-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the α + HKβ complexes are unstable in SDS, and the influence of the mutations on the ATPase activity of these complexes could not be determined.Table IIIComparison of the effects of mutations in NKα3 on ouabain binding capacity and on ouabain-inhibitable ATPase activity in yeast membranesMutationB maxATPase activity%%None100 ± 18100 ± 3V904Q5 ± 24 ± 2Y898R42 ± 1044 ± 2C908G119 ± 2290 ± 9Y898R,C908G31 ± 226 ± 3The data for the B max values are from the experiments summarized in Fig. 7.

The stability of the NKα3 mutants expressed in yeast with NKβ1 or HKβ was investigated by heating the membranes at different temperatures (40–50 °C) for 90 s and then measuring the amount of ouabain bound at 37 °C. Fig. 7 (upper panel) shows that all of the mutants are as stable as NKα3 + NKβ1 when expressed with NKβ1. In contrast, when expressed with HKβ, both NKα3 and the mutants denature at much lower temperatures (lower panel). Compared with NKα3 + HKβ, the α + HKβ complexes containing the mutations Y898R and C908G are significantly less stable. The mutant containing the double mutation Y898R,C908G is extremely unstable when expressed with HKβ. Ouabain binding by complexes of this mutant expressed with HKβ was not detected after the membranes were heated at 45 °C for 90 s (data not shown). In contrast to Y898R and C908G, the mutation V904Q in NKα3 has no effect on the thermal stability of the functional α + HKβ complexes. Glutamine is conserved in all gastric HKα subunits in the position corresponding to Val904 in NKα. It has been shown previously that both α and β subunits are required by NK and gastric HK to catalyze active ion transport (17Noguchi S. Mishina M. Kawamura M. Numa S.

This result indicates that interactions between β subunits and colon HKα or gastric HKα are mediated by amino acids that are different in the two α subunits. Wang et al. (2Wang S.-G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that substitution of amino acids Gln905–Val930 from rat gastric HKα for the corresponding sequence Asn886–Ala911 of rat NKα3 reduces the assembly of this chimeric α subunit (NGH26) with NKβ1 compared with assembly with HKβ. In the experiments reported here, a chimeric α subunit (NCH26) was formed by replacing the sequence Asn886–Ala911 of rat NKα3 with the corresponding sequence Asn908–Ala933 of the rat colon HKα subunit to examine the structural basis for the selectivity of α subunits for assembly with different β subunits. The formation of functional pumps was compared when NKα3, NCH26, or NGH26 was expressed in yeast with either NKβ1 or gastric HKβ, and amino acids in the α subunits that are important for interactions between α and β subunits were identified after site-directed mutagenesis. The steady-state abundance of the NCH26 polypeptides expressed in yeast with NKβ1 or HKβ is the same as that of NKα3 (Fig. 1 A). About 40% of the NCH26 + NKβ1 complexes are functional, as determined by the ability to bind ouabain, and about 20% of the NCH26 + HKβ complexes are functional (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with the observation of Codina et al.(4Codina J. Kone B.C. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29759-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that the colon HKα is capable of functional assembly with either NKβ1 or gastric HKβ. The result also suggests that some NCH26 + β complexes are inactive in the yeast membranes. Codina et al. (4Codina J. Kone B.C. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29759-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported that high concentrations of ouabain inhibited colon HKα expressed in Xenopus oocytes with either NKβ1 or HKβ (IC50 = 400–600 μm in the presence of 1 mm external KCl). In the absence of KCl, the K d for ouabain binding to NKα3 expressed in yeast with either NKβ1 or HKβ is 6–8 nm (Tables 1 and 2). The K d for ouabain binding to NCH26 + NKβ1 is 50 nm, and for NCH26 + gastric HKβ the K d is greater than 200 nm. It is likely, therefore, that the low affinity of colon HKα for ouabain is due at least in part to amino acids Asn908–Ala933. These amino acids are found in a loop predicted from hydropathy analysis to be located on the non-cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane, between transmembrane segments 7 and 8. The loop between these transmembrane segments of NKα has been implicated in ouabain binding by Schultheis et al. (20Schultheis P.J. Wallick E.T. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22686-22694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who observed that mutations in Arg880 led to a reduction in the affinity of the sodium pump for ouabain. The chimeric α subunit NGH26 contains amino acids Gln905–Val930 from rat gastric HKα substituted for Asn886–Ala911 of rat NKα3. When this chimera was expressed in yeast, about 10 times as many pumps were assembled with gastric HKβ as with NKβ1 (2Wang S.-G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in the number of pumps assembled in yeast from NKα, from gastric HKα, or from the chimeric polypeptides NCH26 and NGH26 and either NKβ1 or HKβ probably reflects differences in assembly or in the stability of the different αβ complexes. Consequently, mutations were made in the chimeras NGH26 and NCH26 and also in NKα3 to identify amino acid side chains that might mediate αβ subunit interactions. Introduction of charged amino acids in positions 902 and 905 of NGH26 (L902K and Q905E) increased the affinity of the pump for ouabain but did not increase the number of pumps assembled with HKβ (Table I). Because the single mutations alone did not influence the dissociation constant of ouabain binding of NGH26 + HKβ, it is likely that neither Leu902 nor Gln905 interacts directly with ouabain. The lower K d of the double mutant is probably caused by an induced tertiary structure in the ouabain binding site of the double mutant similar to that of the NKα3 subunit. Because neither the single mutations (L902K and Q905E) nor the double mutation (L902K,Q905E) increase the B max of NGH26 expressed with either NKβ1 or HKβ, these amino acids also are probably not located in the αβ interaction interface. The chimera containing the L902K and Q905E mutations (NGH26-KE) was used as a template for additional mutations that changed amino acids in the chimera to those found in NKα3. Most of the mutations in NGH26-KE did not affect ouabain binding by the chimera; however, the mutations Y903V and Q904V led to a significant increase in the amount of ouabain bound when the mutant/chimeric α subunit was expressed with NKβ1 (Fig. 5). This result suggests that one or both of these small hydrophobic amino acids may be important for complex formation with NKβ1. The valine at position 903 is not conserved among NKα subunits. Polar amino acids including threonine, glutamine, and glutamic acid are also found at this position in some isoforms or species. A non-polar amino acid such as valine, leucine, or isoleucine is conserved at position 904 in all NKα subunits, and a glutamine is found at this position in all gastric HKα subunits. Because gastric HKα subunits do not assemble with NKβ subunits, the mutation V904Q was made in NKα3 to test whether the glutamine in position 904 of gastric HKα could be the reason that gastric HKα does not assemble with NKβ1. The V904Q mutation in NKα3 caused a reduction in both the number of functional αβ complexes (Fig. 6) and the ATPase activity (Table III) to only 5% of NKα3 + NKβ1, without affecting the affinity of the mutant for ouabain (Table II). This result shows that the presence of glutamine at position 904 in gastric HKα subunits is sufficient to prevent assembly of HKα subunits with NKβ1. It also suggests that valine or another small hydrophobic amino acid in position 904 in NKα subunits is important for assembly with NKβ1. In addition to Val904, Tyr898 also appears to be important for assembly of α subunits with NKβ1. The mutation R898Y in NCH26 caused a 2-fold increase in the number of functional α + NKβ1 complexes (Fig. 3), and the reverse mutation Y898R in NKα3 caused a 50% reduction in the number of functional pumps when assembled with NKβ1 (Fig. 6). Arginine is conserved in colon HKα subunits at the position corresponding to amino acid 898 of NKα3, and the positive charge may limit assembly of colon HKα subunits with NKβ subunits. Interestingly, the Y898R mutation did not lead to a decrease in the number of pumps formed with gastric HKβ (Fig. 6). The thermal stability of pumps containing the V904Q or Y898R mutation in NKα3 is comparable to that of nonmutated NKα3 (Fig. 7). This result indicates that the reduced number of functional pumps containing these mutations is probably not the consequence of unstable αβ complexes. The limiting factor may be the initial assembly of the two polypeptides, such that the V904Q or Y898R mutation in NKα3 prevents the majority of the two subunits from forming functional complexes.

Beguin P. Jaunin P. Peitsch M.C. Geering K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14117-14124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In particular, the double mutation V269N,F271N abolished the cellular accumulation of α subunits, which is an indication of αβ complex formation. The finding here that Val904 and Tyr898 in NKα3 are important for assembly with NKβ1 is intriguing in this context. Perhaps the valine-aromatic amino acid pair on each subunit interacts with one another to provide a stable contact between the subunits. The double mutation Y898R,C908G in NKα3 caused a reduction in the number of functional pumps assembled with HKβ by 90%, despite the absence of an effect of either mutation alone (Fig. 6). This effect of the double mutation on the assembly of NKα3 with HKβ is consistent with the observation that the reciprocal mutations R898Y,G908C in NCH26 led to a 4-fold increase in the amount of ouabain bound when when this chimeric/mutant α subunit was expressed in yeast with HKβ. The thermal stability profile (Fig. 7) demonstrates that NKα3 with the double mutation Y898R,C908G is extremely unstable when assembled with HKβ. Thus, the small number of pumps assembled either from NKα3 containing either these mutations or from NCH26, and HKβ, may be the consequence of instability in α + HKβ complexes caused by arginine and glycine at these positions. The double mutations Y898R,C908G in NKα3 also caused a 13-fold reduction in the ouabain affinity of pumps assembled with NKβ1 (Table II) with little effect on complex stability (Fig. 7). Because neither Y898R nor C908G alone affected ouabain binding, it is likely that neither Tyr898 nor Cys908 is located within the ouabain binding site, and the double mutation reduces ouabain affinity by indirectly affecting the ouabain binding site."

Quinton suggested in 1983 (24Quinton P.M. Nature. 1983; 301: 421-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) that Cl− transport is defective in CF,1 and 6 years later, cloning of the CF gene and subsequent studies showed that CFTR is indeed a chloride channel (1Anderson M.P.

The selectivity of the channel is Br− > Cl− > I− > F−. Subsequent to the cloning of the CF gene, many investigators have used site-directed mutagenesis to create CFTR cDNAs containing both naturally occurring and artificial mutations. Studies on the consequences of these mutations have shaped our thinking about the structure and function of the protein. For example, a mutant CFTR (TNRCFTR) composed of the first transmembrane domain, the first nucleotide binding domain, and the R domain can form a functional chloride channel with characteristics approaching that of wtCFTR (3Sheppard D.N. Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1091-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,4Morales M.M. Carroll T.P. Morita T. Schwiebert E.M. Devuyst O. Wilson P.D.

An additional construct composed of only the first six transmembrane-spanning segments of TMD1 also forms an ion channel with selectivity and single-channel conductance identical to that of wild-type CFTR (5Schwiebert E.M. Morales M.M. Devidas S. Egan M.E. Guggino W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2674-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have previously shown (6Carroll T.P. Morales M.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11941-11946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that the ion selectivity and single-channel conductance of Δ259 CFTR, which contains membrane-spanning segments M5, M6, and the second half of the CFTR, are identical to those of wild-type CFTR. These studies suggest that the major structural components that allow the CFTR to select among different anions reside within TMD1, more specifically, distal to transmembrane segment M4. Although TMD1 (7Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Cook T.A. Archdeacon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14865-14868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) has been studied extensively, the role of the second half of the CFTR in ion conduction is still unresolved. To evaluate the functional contributions of this region of the protein, we generated deletion constructs encompassing the second half of the CFTR (Fig. 1). The cRNA for these mutants was then injected into Xenopus oocytes. Seventy-two h after injection, two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed to look for channel activity. The first construct contains the regulatory domain, the second transmembrane domain, and the second nucleotide binding domain of CFTR (RT2N2CFTR). A second construct containing the second transmembrane domain and the second nucleotide binding domain (T2N2CFTR) was also tested for cAMP-stimulated chloride channel activity. Both constructs included the first 159 bases of wtCFTR so as to include the Kozak methionine for translation initiation. Our results suggest that the second half of the CFTR does play a role in Cl− conduction. The double-stranded mutagenesis method (Stratagene) was used to generate all of the necessary mutations. Both constructs (RT2N2CFTR and T2N2CFTR) were constructed using a wtCFTR plasmid (PBluescript CFTR) as the template. AStuI site (AGGCCT) was created at position 160 using the oligonucleotide CGCCTCTGGAAAAGGCCTGCGTTGTCTCCAAAC, and anotherStuI site was created at positions 2125 (for RT2N2CFTR) and 2523 (for T2N2CFTR) using oligonucleotides CCTAACTGAGGCCTTACACCGTTTCTCATTAGAAGG and CGAAAAGTGTCACTGGCGCCTCAGGCAAACTTG, respectively. The selection primer used for this method of mutagenesis was one that eliminated theKpnI site on the vector backbone (CGACCTCGAGGGGGGGCCCAGATCTCAGCTTTTGTTCCC). The three oligonucleotides were phosphorylated and added to a mixture of wtCFTR plasmid and mutagenesis buffer, followed by denaturation by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. The mixture was cooled on ice for 5 min and then at room temperature for 30 min to facilitate the annealing of the primers to the single-stranded template. The oligonucleotides were extended using DNA polymerase and deoxynucleotide triphosphates, followed by ligation with DNA ligase. Any wild-type plasmid that remained was eliminated by digestion with KpnI for 2 h. A mutS strain was then transformed with the digestion mix and spread out on LB-agar plates overnight. Plasmid DNA was extracted from the colonies and redigested with KpnI to eliminate the wild-type plasmids. The remaining undigested plasmids were then retransformed into XL1 supercompetent cells. Plasmids were then extracted from individual colonies and screened for the mutation of interest. Plasmids carrying mutations at both sites (160 and 2125/2523) were ligated after removal of the intervening regions (160–2125 for RT2N2CFTR and 160–2523 for T2N2CFTR) using the Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The sequences were confirmed by sequencing. The newly generated constructs thus had the first 159 bases of wtCFTR so as to include the Kozak methionine to facilitate translation initiation and the second half of the CFTR (2125–4700 for RT2N2CFTR; 2523–4700 for T2N2CFTR). The cDNA fragments encoding the two second-half constructs were excised from their PBQ vector backbones using the restriction enzymes NotI and SalI. These were then subcloned into a PRSVCFTR vector that had been cut with the same two enzymes to excise wtCFTR, followed by ligation using the Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PBqCFTR vector was linearized with XhoI (New England Biolabs). One μg of the linearized DNA was in vitro-transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion Megascript Kit; Ambion, Austin, TX). The methodologies involved have been described in detail by Schwiebertet al. (5Schwiebert E.M. Morales M.M. Devidas S. Egan M.E. Guggino W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2674-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The methodologies involved have been described in detail by Morales et al. (4Morales M.M. Carroll T.P. Morita T. Schwiebert E.M. Devuyst O. Wilson P.D. Lopes A.G. Stanton B.A. Dietz H.C. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F1038-F1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the expression studies, oocytes were isolated and incubated for 24 h in modified Barth's solution for 24 h before microinjection. Fifty ng of RNA were microinjected into the cytoplasm of the oocytes and incubated at 18 °C for 72 h. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed on an oocyte immersed in a 1-ml recording chamber filled with frog Ringer solution. The frog Ringer solution used consisted of 115 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCL, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. DIDS (500 μm) was used in the frog Ringer solution at all times. To study iodide currents, sodium chloride in the Ringer solution was substituted by an equimolar quantity of sodium iodide. For membrane current measurements, the oocytes were impaled with two electrodes filled with 3 mKCl with resistances of 0.5–2 megaohms. The resting membrane potentials were allowed to stabilize for 15 min and were typically in the range of 38–48 mV. The membrane potentials were clamped to −40 mV using a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (AXOCLAMP-2A; Axon Instruments). The voltage protocol used consisted of voltage steps ranging from −80 to +60 mV in increments of 20 mV delivered from a Pentium 133 MHz computer. Data were analyzed using PClamp 6.03 software (Axon Instruments). Experiments were performed at room temperature. The cAMP stimulation mixture consisting of 10 μm forskolin and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was added after recording the baseline current. Ten to 15 min after the addition of the mixture, currents were recorded again to measure channel activity. Cells were seeded at 30–50% confluence and transfected as described previously (5Schwiebert E.M. Morales M.M. Devidas S. Egan M.E. Guggino W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2674-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with Ca2+Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) to remove serum. Thirty μl of36Cl− solution (DuPont New England Nuclear; 1 mCi/ml) were diluted in 9 ml of Ringer's solution, and 1.5 ml of this loading solution were added to each well of a 6-well plate. The plate was incubated for 2–3 h in a 37 °C room. The Ringer's solution for these experiments was a standard HCO3−-free, HEPES- and phosphate-buffered, 140 mm NaCl Ringer solution supplemented with 5 mm glucose and titrated to pH 7.45 with 1n NaOH. All efflux runs were performed in a 37 °C room. Each well served as its own control. At time 0, Ringer's solution without cAMP agonists was added and removed immediately. A fresh aliquot of Ringer's solution was added immediately after that, and the efflux run was started. This process was repeated every 15 s until the 1 min time point, at which time 750 μl of Ringer's solution with forskolin (2.5 mm), 8-bromo-cAMP (250 mm), and CPT-cAMP (250 mm) were added and removed every 15 s for the remaining 2 min of the efflux run. At the end of the run, 750 μl of 0.5 n NaOH was added in two aliquots to lyse and recover all of the cell lysate to determine how much labeled chloride had remained in the cells, and this was used to standardize the data. Each sample was diluted in a scintillation mixture, counted in a scintillation counter, and normalized on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet as the rate of labeled chloride lost from the cells per minute. Cells were seeded at 50% confluence and transfected with wild-type, mutant, or truncated CFTR cDNA. The night before recording and approximately 48 h after transfection, transfected cells were trypsinized from 6-well plates, seeded, and concentrated onto Vitrogen (human collagen; Celtrix, Inc., Palo Alto, CA)-coated glass coverslips (Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ) for patch-clamp recording. Symmetrical 145 mm Tris-Cl solutions were used to study Cl− currents exclusively. Whole cell recording has been described in detail previously (9Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T.H. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Single-channel patch-clamp recording was carried out in the excised inside-out patch-clamp configuration by using conventional procedures. Catalytic subunits of protein kinase A (75 nm; Promega) and Mg-ATP (1 mm; Sigma) were added to cytoplasmic face of excised patches to activate the channel. All single-channel patch-clamp studies were performed at 25 °C. Integrity of the cell-attached patch was confirmed by visualizing the membrane patch ripping away from the cell, because the patch was excised from the inside-out configuration. Currents were amplified with an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier and recorded on videotape for later analysis. Data were low-pass filtered at 200 Hz and digitized at 1 kHz. Data were analyzed by pCLAMP6.03 software. A simplex maximum likelihood estimate routine was used to fit the logarithmically binned data (6 bins/decade). The bath solution contained 140 mm N-methyl-d-glutamine chloride, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.35 withN-methyl-d-glutamine); the pipette solution contained 140 mm N-methyl-d-glutamine chloride, 2 mmCaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.35 withN-methyl-d-glutamine). To evaluate the functions of the second transmembrane domain of CFTR, cRNA for wtCFTR and the two second-half mutants was expressed in Xenopusoocytes. Water-injected oocytes exhibited little or no current activity in the absence (I = 90.06 ± 6.88 nA,n = 9 at 60 mV; Fig. 2) or presence of cAMP agonists (I = 92.24 ± 7.44 nA, n = 9 at 60 mV). wtCFTR-injected oocytes expressed linear currents upon cAMP stimulation that were DIDS insensitive and exhibited linear I/V characteristics and a reversal potential consistent with a chloride current. The current magnitude was reduced (wtCFTR, I Cl− = 534.67 ± 39.7 nA at 60 mV (n = 8) and I I− = 410.1 ± 39.7 nA at 60 mV (n = 8); Fig. 3) upon switching to an iodide Ringer solution, consistent with the selectivity profile demonstrated for wtCFTR (Cl− > I−; Ref. 1Anderson M.P.

Representative two-electrode voltage clamp current recordings of wild-type CFTR-injected oocytes. Basal, cAMP-stimulated, and I/V current characteristics are depicted. The voltage protocol used consisted of a stepwise depolarization, in steps of 20 mV, from −80 to +60 mV with a holding potential of −40 mV. The outward rectification of the curves is due to the higher extracellular concentration of chloride (121 mm) compared with that of the inside of the oocyte (40 mm). Average whole cell currents at +60 mV are as follows: basal, I = 115.06 ± 9.16 nA, n = 8; cAMP-stimulated current,I Cl− = 534.67 ± 39.7 A,n = 8; I I− = 410.1 ± 39.7 nA at 60 mV, n = 8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On the contrary, oocytes injected with RT2N2CFTR (I = 470.52 ± 84.51 nA at 60 mV) exhibited a large baseline constitutive current compared with those injected with wtCFTR (I = 115.06 ± 9.16 nA, n = 8 at 60 mV; Fig. 4). The current was further increased upon the addition of cAMP agonists (RT2N2CFTR,I = 676.03 ± 87 nA at 60 mV, n = 9; wtCFTR, I = 534.67 ± 39.7 nA at 60 mV,n = 8). The current magnitude was unchanged upon switching the Ringer solution from one in which the predominant anion was chloride to one in which the predominant anion was iodide. This was in contrast to wtCFTR-injected oocytes, in which a decrease in current magnitude was observed upon switching to an iodide-containing Ringer's solution. Oocytes injected with cRNA for T2N2CFTR exhibited a small baseline current similar to that exhibited by wtCFTR-injected oocytes (Table I, I = 86.47 ± 6.62 nA, n = 8 at 60 mV; Fig. 5). However, the addition of cAMP agonists increased the current magnitude by only 10–20% compared with wtCFTR (I = 175.38 ± 17.46 nA, n= 8 at 60 mV). There was, however, no change in current magnitude upon switching to an iodide-containing Ringer's solution.Table ICl− currents in cRNA-injected oocytescRNA-injected oocytesBasal (nA)cAMP-stimulated oocytes (nA)nWater90.06 ± 6.8892.24 ± 7.449Wild-type CFTR115.06 ± 9.16534.67 ± 39.78Del 259-M265 CFTR103.27 ± 4.32429.06 ± 3.914RT2N2CFTR470.52 ± 84.51676.036 ± 879T2N2CFTR86.47 ± 6.62175.38 ± 17.468Current values are shown for all mutants immediately before and 15 min after the application of cAMP agonists (see “Materials and Methods”) at the 60 mV clamped voltage.

To assess the Cl− channel functions of CFTR, paired36Cl− efflux assays without and with a cAMP agonist mixture (2.5 μm forskolin and 250 μm 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP or CPT-cAMP) were performed in IB3-1 cells. IB3-1 cells are a CF bronchial epithelial cell line used extensively to study CFTR function. The experiments were performed as an initial screen to assess whether an individual CFTR mutant could restore cAMP-stimulated efflux of labeled chloride. Parental IB3-1 cells and mock-transfected IB3-1 cells failed to respond to cAMP agonists (Table II), which is typical of CF cells. Wild-type-, Δ259-M265-, RT2N2CFTR-, and T2N2CFTR- transfected cells, however, all responded to cAMP agonists as predicted from oocyte recordings (Table II). Surprisingly, cells transfected with T2N2CFTR also demonstrated an increase in efflux upon cAMP stimulation that was similar to that exhibited by cells transfected with wtCFTR. This could be attributed to a larger number of channels being formed on the plasma membrane.Table IICl− efflux analysis in IB3–1 cellscDNA-transfected cellsnCl− efflux (counts/min)Before agonistsAfter agonistsMock2435.92 ± 6.1129.31 ± 3.95wtCFTR2436.76 ± 15.5166.80 ± 27.64Del 259-M265 CFTR2421.85 ± 1.4347.67 ± 5.95RT2N2CFTR2426.47 ± 7.7837.65 ± 9.15T2N2CFTR2424.94 ± 5.1547.71 ± 12.9936Cl− efflux of labeled chloride from IB3–1 CF cells is shown.

Whole cell current patch-clamp recordings were carried out to assess the Cl− channel function of wild-type CFTR and the second-half mutants in IB3-1 cells, a CF cell line. Mock-transfected cells failed to exhibit cAMP-stimulated chloride currents (Fig. 6 A). However, cells transfected with wtCFTR exhibited cAMP-stimulated currents that were DIDS insensitive (Fig. 6 B). Cells transfected with RT2N2CFTR exhibited a larger baseline compared with those transfected with wtCFTR. When stimulated, RT2N2CFTR-transfected cells generated currents comparable to those of wtCFTR-transfected cells (Fig. 6 C). On the other hand, cells transfected with T2N2CFTR exhibited a small baseline current comparable to that of wtCFTR-transfected cells and were stimulated to a smaller extent upon the addition of cAMP agonists (Fig. 6 D). Single-channel analysis of the mutant constructs in excised inside-out patches also revealed chloride channels with significantly smaller conductances than that of wtCFTR (Table III; Fig. 7), whereas wtCFTR had a conductance of 10.2 pS, compared with a conductance of 4 pS for RT2N2CFTR and 3.8 pS for T2N2CFTR. Interestingly enough, both constructs were nonselective for the halides chloride or iodide, in contrast with wild-type CFTR, which was more selective for chloride than iodide.Table IIISingle-channel characteristics of the second-half of CFTR in IB3–1 CF cellsConstructnConductance (pS)Po3-aPo, probability.SelectivitywtCFTR510.2 ± 0.430.56 ± 0.07Br− > Cl− > I−RT2N2CFTR54.0 ± 0.500.18 ± 0.03Br− = Cl− = I−T2N2CFTR53.8 ± 0.610.15 ± 0.04Br−= Cl− = I−Single-channel patch-clamp recording from IB3–1 CF cells transfected with wt-CFTR, RT2N2-CFTR, and T2N2-CFTR is shown.

These mutants expressed chloride currents upon cAMP stimulation, which had close to wild-type characteristics. The single-channel conductances and anion selectivity of these mutants resembled that of wild-type CFTR, suggesting that ICL4 does not contribute directly to the conduction pore. However, the mutants did have varied influences on the open state probability and burst duration. The authors speculate that ICL4 mutations might disrupt or modify some aspect of gating of the Cl− channel pore but not the conduction of anions through the pore. Siebert et al. (16Siebert F.S.

Fluorescence assays on peptides corresponding to the individual transmembrane segments revealed that membrane-spanning regions in the second half were able to conduct chloride and could thus line the pore in the wild-type protein. McCarty et al. (17McCarty N.A. McDonough S. Cohen B.N. Riordan J.R. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and McDonoughet al.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) studied the diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid binding properties of residues within the putative chloride permeation pathway of CFTR. Residues in CFTR that exhibit altered diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid binding properties when mutated may line the pore. They showed that residues in both M6 and M12 may line the channel pore, suggesting that regions of the second half of the CFTR may line the channel pore. Anderson et al. (1Anderson M.P. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 251: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) mutated several amino acids in the TMDs and evaluated their effects on CFTR channel function. They hypothesized that if the charged amino acids that lined the channel were mutated, they would disrupt the wild-type electrical forces in the pore, thereby influencing ion selectivity. Lys95 in M1 and Lys335 in M6 were mutated to Asp and Glu, respectively. HeLa cells were transfected with wtCFTR or with the mutants. Analysis of whole cell cAMP-stimulated chloride currents showed that these lysine mutations altered wild-type ion selectivity from Br− > Cl− > I− > F− to I− > Br− > Cl− > F−. In contrast, the mutation of Arg347 in M6 and Arg1030 in M10 did not induce major differences in halide selectivity compared with wtCFTR. From these data, they concluded that the residues in TMD1 play an important role in the selectivity filter of the CFTR. The results from our studies suggest that regions of the second half of CFTR may line the channel pore and have important contributions to its chloride channel function, whereas the selectivity filter of CFTR is provided by charged residues on the sixth transmembrane segment (M6) of wtCFTR. We have shown that expression of the second half of CFTR distal to the first nucleotide binding domain generated functional chloride channels albeit with properties distinct from that of wild-type CFTR. RT2N2CFTR produces Cl− currents that are stimulated by cAMP. On the other hand, T2N2CFTR generated a smaller increase in current upon cAMP stimulation. This could be due to the fact that T2N2CFTR has no consensus phosphorylation sites, whereas RT2N2CFTR retains most of the phosphorylation sites that lie in the R domain. In the case of the wild-type protein, phosphorylation of the R domain followed by ATP binding and hydrolysis causes the opening of the channel. In the case of RT2N2CFTR, the R domain is unable to keep the channel closed in the basal or unstimulated state. This could suggest that in the absence of the first transmembrane domain and the first nucleotide binding domain, the R domain is unable to form a regulated channel. Furthermore, the first two domains may be necessary for the R domain to keep the channel closed in the unstimulated state. The observation that T2N2CFTR channels were not stimulated significantly upon the addition of cAMP agonists is not surprising because this construct lacks any consensus PKA phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, NBD1 has been shown to be responsible for the opening of the channel, whereas NBD2 has been shown to be associated with channel closing. The presence of NBD2 in this construct could also result in the longer closure of these channels and, subsequently, a smaller stimulation of the channels. The smaller conductance exhibited by these second-half constructs could suggest that the overall conductance of CFTR is provided by TMD1 and TMD2. TNRCFTR, which contains the first transmembrane domain, the first nucleotide domain, and the R domain, displays a conductance (8 pS) almost equal to that of wtCFTR, whereas the second-half constructs discussed above show much smaller conductances (RT2N2CFTR, 4 pS; T2N2CFTR, 3.8 pS). This could suggest that the major contribution to the size of the pore comes from the first half of the protein, whereas regions of the second half could contribute a smaller part. The results summarized above suggest that the second half of CFTR has important functions in the overall tertiary structure of the channel. The regions of the second half distal to the second nucleotide binding domain may also play important roles in the regulatory interactions of CFTR with the outwardly rectifying chloride channel, the epithelial sodium channel, and other potassium channels. Finally, the discovery of proteins that facilitate interactions between membrane proteins via interactions at the amino and carboxyl termini could add importance to the second half of CFTR. There is growing evidence that proteins with PDZ domains do interact with other ion channels (19Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 20Kim E. Cho K.O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Expression of proteins containing these domains causes a clustering of ion channels and receptors at the plasma membrane. For instance, coexpression of PSD-95 (a PDZ domain-containing protein) results in clustering of voltage gated K+ channels and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors at the plasma membrane (19Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). The PSD-95 protein recognizes a specific sequence present at both the carboxyl termini of the Shaker voltage gated K+ channel and the NR2 subunit of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. Similar domains have also been identified recently for CFTR (21Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several such proteins have been discovered that interact with the carboxyl-terminal of CFTR, rendering this region of the protein to be of greater importance than previously thought (21Wang S.

The majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded from nuclear DNA and synthesized in the cytosol. These nascent proteins possess nonidentical N-terminal amino acid sequences that contain sufficient information to direct the protein from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Although mitochondrial leaders do not share any primary sequence identity, they are statistically rich in positively charged amino acid residues and display the ability to form an amphiphilic secondary structure (1von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 2Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial receptors, which recognize and interact with these leader sequences, possess regions in their primary sequence that are enriched with negatively charged residues (3Pfanner N. Craig E.A. Honlinger A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although the structures of the various import receptor components are unknown, it is likely that certain receptor components bind the leader sequences amphiphilically (4Roise D. Theiler F.

The enrichment of negative charges within segments of the mitochondrial receptors implies an electrostatic complementation to the positive charges of the leader sequence. From a statistical basis, negatively charged amino acid residues are infrequently found in leader sequences (1von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). However, a number of leader sequences that have been investigated, such as isopropyl malate synthase (6Beltzer J.P. Morris S.R. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol.

Mutational studies have demonstrated both a tolerance and an intolerance to the introduction of negative charges within leader sequences (10Bedwell D.M. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell.

The statistical fact that naturally occurring leader sequences are biased to be rich in positive charges, coupled with conflicting import results from the mutagenic introduction of negatively charged residues, raises questions as to how negative charges could be tolerated. The leader sequence for the pALDH1 has been studied extensively both structurally and in two separate systematic mutational investigations (14Wang Y. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4759-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9872-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the leader is comprised of 19 amino acids that can be induced into a helix-linker-helix amphiphilic structure in the presence of trifluroethanol or detergent micelles. Deletion of the linker results in a nonprocessible leader that is more stable and longer in helical content (17Thornton K. Wang Y. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19906-19914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the linker results in a leader capable of importing aldehyde dehydrogenase to greater levels than that of the native sequence (15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The enhanced stability of the linker-deleted leader has been successfully used to study structural aspects as a compensating factor for the loss of positive charges through arginine to glutamine mutational substitutions. The leader sequence of pALDH contains five arginines with two arginines in each helix and one in the linker segment. It was found from a mutational study that numerous arginine to glutamine substitutions could be made with no apparent effect on import (15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although each helical segment contains an equal number of positive charges, the N-terminal helical segment has been shown to provide the majority of the necessary charge for efficiently targeting the leader to the matrix. If both of the N-helical segment arginines were substituted with glutamine residues, the ability to import was essentially eliminated. This result implies that the net positive charge in the N-helical segment is more important than the total positive charge throughout the leader. In contrast, the linker-deleted structure could import a passenger protein even if both of the N-terminal arginine residues (Arg3 and Arg10) were mutated to glutamines. The linker-deleted leader demonstrated that a longer, more stable amphiphilic structure compensates for the absence of the N-terminal positive charges. Based on the positive chargeversus structural compensation model developed from our previous studies, glutamic and aspartic acid residues were systematically introduced into the pALDH leader to ascertain how negative charges may be tolerated. The plasmid containing rat liver mitochondrial pALDH, which was previously cloned into pGEM-3Z (Promega; Ref. 18Farres J. Guan K.L. Weiner H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), was digested with BglII and HindIII to remove the segment coding from amino acid residue 23 to the end the mature protein. Mouse dihydrofolate reductase cloned into SP64 was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction utilizing a 5′ primer with aBglII overhang and a 3′ primer with a HindIII overhang. The BglII- and HindIII-digested polymerase chain reaction fragment was ligated to the abovementioned vector, resulting in a plasmid that codes for the leader sequence of pALDH, the first 22 amino acids of the mature segment of pALDH, followed by dihydrofolate reductase. Subsequent point mutations within the leader sequence were performed by polymerase chain reaction with 5′ primers encoding a SphI overhang and the desired codon change and a 3′ primer with a BglII site. Oligonucleotides were obtained and purified as described previously (15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All mutational constructs were verified by sequencing. Mitochondria were isolated from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley Wistar rat livers as described previously (15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol.

Radiolabeled proteins were synthesized using the TNT Quick Coupled transcription and translation system (Promega). Quantification of import was performed using the band intensities from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels with a Bio-Rad phosphor imaging system. The level of import was defined as the ratio of the total counts of the protease-protected bands:that of the total counts provided in the assay. The import values obtained from the mutant leaders were normalized to the values obtained from the native leader in the same experiment. The averages shown in Table I reflect a minimum of three separate import experiments.Table ICorrelation between pALDH mutant import and residual positive chargeaImport is reported on a relative scale to the native leader sequence.

The experiments were performed at a peptide concentration of 20 μm at 25 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.2 or pH 7.2. The percentage of TFE was based on volume. Three baseline determinations were obtained and averaged at the given percentage of TFE. Three measurements with the peptide under the same percentage of TFE were obtained and averaged. A value of −35,600 was used to estimate the fraction of peptide in a helical conformation at [Θ]222 (15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol.

The pALDH leader sequence is structurally comprised of two amphiphilic helical segments joined by a flexible, three-amino acid linker segment (Fig. 1). Each helical segment, referred to as either the N-terminal or the C-terminal segment, contains two arginines, whereas the linker contains one arginine. It was our aim to determine the effect on import by the introduction of negative charges, particularly in the N-terminal helical segment, because this helix segment is thought to be responsible for the positive charge required for import (14Wang Y. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4759-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We chose Ser7 as the residue to begin the site-directed mutagenic introduction of a negative charge. A mutagenic replacement of this Ser with Glu or Asp would retain the amphiphilicity required for mitochondrial leader sequences, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (4Roise D. Theiler F. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Allison D.S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As a control for replacing Ser7with the charged residues, both Gln and Asn were substituted at the same position. As shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table I, the S7N and S7Q mutants were capable of targeting the dihydrofolate reductase passenger protein to the matrix to the same extent as the native leader. The S7E mutant was imported to levels that averaged up to 84% of the native leader, indicating a tolerance to a negative charge. The S7D mutant was only capable of importing to about 30% of the native levels. Previously, we showed that only one arginine was required in the N-terminal domain of the pALDH leader sequence, because both the R3Q and R10Q mutant leaders were imported as well as the native sequence (15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The double mutant R3Q(R10Q) was impaired at import, demonstrating a necessity for at least one positive charge in the first 10 amino acids. If the positive charges of the arginines could interact with the negative charge through ion pairing, this interaction could shield and reduce the effect of the introduced negative charge. To test this hypothesis, two mutants were made in which the flanking arginines were substituted with glutamine, a neutral, helix-promoting residue. As shown in Fig. 2, the R3Q(S7E) and R10Q(S7E) mutants were imported less than the S7E mutant, indicating that both arginines were required to achieve native import levels when a negatively charged amino acid was present at position 7. In the R3Q(S7E) and R10Q(S7E) mutants, the total charge of the leader has been reduced from +5 to +3, whereas in the N-terminal helical segment, the charge was reduced from +2 to 0. The N-helical segment of the impaired R3Q(R10Q) leader also possessed a net charge of 0. If a net charge within the N-terminal helical segment is more important than the total charge of the leader, then we could potentially influence this net charge through a S7E(R11E) mutant. Although, this additional glutamic acid is not part of the N-terminal helical segment, its presence could cancel the effect of the adjacent positive charge of Arg10. As shown in Fig. 2, the S7E(R11E) mutant was impaired at import. The import results with the mutants of S7E, R3Q(S7E), and R10Q(S7E), as well as the R3Q(R10Q) previously studied, converge to a model that supports a regional net charge effect in the leader sequence of pALDH rather than the total number of positive charges in the entire leader, as has been previously implied with the ornithine transcarbamylase leader (19Horwich A.L. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. Furtak K. Pollock R.A. Rosenberg L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, S7E(R11E) does not fully support the model of a regional N-terminal net charge because the total charge of the leader may have been reduced too much. To attempt to resolve whether S7E(R11E) was impairing import by influencing either the total charge of the leader or the N-helical segment's net charge, we introduced an additional negative charge into the C-helical segment of the S7E mutant. The two arginines in the C helix of the native leader could be separately mutated to glutamines without any effect on import, but the R14Q(R17Q) double mutant was imported to 50% efficiency (15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We chose Arg14 to preserve the processing site motif and thus made a S7E(R14E) leader. If the total charge of the leader were more important than the net charge of the N-helical segment, then we would expect import to be reduced similar to that of S7E(R11E). If the net charge of the N-terminal helical segment were providing the necessary positive charge, we would expect import levels similar to that of R14Q(R17Q). As shown in Fig. 2, neither of the expected results was observed. The S7E(R14E) mutant was found to be more efficient at importing compared with the native leader. In the S7E(R14E) mutant, the overall net charge of the native leader sequence has been reduced, as in the S7E(R11E) mutant, to +2, yet import was increased. What may have compensated for the C-terminal net charge deficiency was a network of potential ion pairs between the Glu and Arg residues that could form in both helical segments as well as between them. There are six potential ion pairs in the S7E(R14E) leader, and this ion pairing may have improved the stability of the leader, especially through the linker segment. If the potential increase in structural stability were the factor in compensating for net positive charge reduction in the C-helical segment, structural stability may also compensate for the loss of positive charge in the N-terminal helical segment by removing the linker. Removing the linker segment in the leader sequence of pALDH has been shown to result in increased stability and helical length (17Thornton K. Wang Y. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19906-19914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown to compensate for the loss of positive charges in the N-helical segment, as with the R3Q(R10Q) mutant (15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Removing the linker from the R3Q(S7E) and R10Q(S7E) double mutants restored import, as shown in Fig. 2. Although both mutants were imported, the efficiencies were dissimilar. The R10Q(S7E)-RGP mutant restored import to levels equivalent to that of the linker-deleted leader, whereas the R3Q(S7E)-RGPmutant was imported to native levels. What may have been a contributing factor for the reduced import in the R3Q(S7E)-RGP leader compared with that of R10Q(S7E)-RGP was that the first N-terminal side chain bearing a charge was negative. However, improving the apparent stability and increasing the helical length of the leader can compensate for an N-terminal positive charge deficiency. The S7D and R3Q(S7E) leaders were impaired at import, which may suggest that the ability of these leaders to be induced into a stable helix has been compromised by the substituted amino acid. Peptides corresponding to the S7D and R3Q(S7E) leaders were studied at 20 and 40% TFE to assess their ability to be induced into an α-helix. Because the S7E leader was not impaired at import, we also studied this leader to assess its ability to form a stable helical structure and compare it with the S7D and R3Q(S7E) peptides. Two different pH conditions were utilized. A pH of 5.2 was used for comparison with the previous circular dichroism and NMR studies with the native and linker-deleted peptides (15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A pH of 7.2 was utilized to keep the glutamic residues ionized in the aqueous TFE medium and thus potentially allow ion pairs to form within the peptides. As summarized in Table II, the ability of the S7D to be induced into a helical conformation at 20 and 40% TFE was comparable to that of the native peptide at pH 5.2. At pH 7.2, the S7D peptide displayed a greater fraction of peptide in a helical conformation compared with that of the native leader at both 20 and 40% TFE. In contrast to the S7D peptide, the S7E peptide was approximately 2-fold higher in helical population compared with that of the native leader at both 20 and 40% TFE and was surprisingly independent of the pH value.Table IICircular dichroism of the S7D, S7E, R3Q(S7E), and S7E(R14E) peptides20% TFE, pH 5.240% TFE, pH 5.220% TFE, pH 7.240% TFE, pH 7.2pALDH2-aValues were previously determined from Ref. 15.−4,896 (14%)−7420 (21%)−4,896 (14%)Not determinedS7D−6,806 (19%)−9,691 (27%)−9,676 (27%)−12,000 (34%)S7E−10,000 (28%)−14,875 (42%)−9,806 (28%)−14,594 (41%)R3Q(S7E)−9,454 (27%)−17,126 (48%)−12,193 (34%)−17,580 (49%)S7E(R14E)−12,080 (29%)−18,503 (52%)−12,972 (36%)−19,344 (54%)pALDH-RGP 2-aValues were previously determined from Ref. 15.−14,959 (42%)−19,586 (55%)Not determinedNot determinedMean residue ellipticity, [θ]222, measured in aqueous TFE prepared as (v/v) proportions with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.2 and pH 7.2.

Open table in a new tab Mean residue ellipticity, [θ]222, measured in aqueous TFE prepared as (v/v) proportions with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.2 and pH 7.2. The fraction of peptide in a helical conformation with respect to the total is shown in parentheses. The R3Q(S7E) peptide, in contrast to S7E, displayed a pH dependence on helical conformation and was more readily induced into a helix at 20 and 40% TFE, pH 7.2. As with the S7D and S7E peptides at 20% TFE and pH 7.2, the S7E and R3Q(S7E) peptides were indistinguishable at 20% TFE, pH 5.2. Although there is a greater ability to form a helical structure in R3Q(S7E) as compared with the S7E peptide, neither peptide was as capable of being induced into a helix as well as the linker-deleted leader. The circular dichroism results with peptides S7D, S7E, and R3Q(S7E) show that their ability to form a helix has not been compromised. Thus, the reason for the reduced import of S7D and R3Q(S7E) is most likely to be charge related and not structurally related. S7E(R14E) displayed greater levels of import, surpassing that of the linker-deleted leader. The peptide S7E(R14E) displayed a pH dependence on being induced into a helix. At 20% TFE and pH 5.2, the population of peptide in a helical conformation was essentially identical to that of S7E and R3Q(S7E). However, at 40% TFE and pH 5.2, the ability to form a helix was approaching that of the linker-deleted peptide. At 40% TFE and pH 7.2, it was nearly identical to that of the linker-deleted peptide. Analogous to the linker-deleted peptide, the ability of S7E(R14E) to form such a stable structure is a likely explanation for the enhanced import. The mitochondrial import receptor complexes of translocator of the outer membrane and translocator of the inner membrane from yeast have been extensively studied, and the functional roles of each complex have been partially uncovered (3Pfanner N. Craig E.A. Honlinger A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The translocator of the outer membrane complex is thought to provide regions of net negative charge on both sides of the outer membrane, which may serve to electrostatically guide the leader to the intermembrane space. The translocator of the inner membrane complex, which is also thought to contain acidic patches for binding leaders, differs from the translocator of the outer membrane complex with respect to the transfer mechanism of a leader across the inner membrane. Translocation from the translocator of the inner membrane complex to the matrix requires a Δψ (negative inside) chemical potential across the inner membrane, used apparently for the electrophoretic migration of the leader (20Schleyer M. Schmidt B. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21Martin J. Mahlke K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18051-18057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing the helix-promoting glutamic acid residue while maintaining amphiphilicity in all of the constructs, we demonstrated a tolerance to a statistically uncommon acidic residue in a mitochondria leader sequence. The leader sequences of the mutants S7E and S7E(R14E) revealed a remarkable tolerance to the presence of a negative charge. A previous study demonstrated that the leader sequence of F1-βATPase could tolerate the mutational introduction of glutamic acids as single and double point mutations (10Bedwell D.M. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4038-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, in another study, negative charges introduced in the same leader interfered with import (11Bedwell D.M. Strobel S.A. Yun K. Jongeward G.D. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1014-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The conflicting results may be interpreted using arguments based on amphiphilicity. In the case in which negative charges interfered with the import of F1-βATPase, amphiphilicity was not maintained. This was also observed in a mutant of malate dehydrogenase in which a Leu to Glu mutation placed the negative charge on what appears to be the hydrophobic portion of the helix (12Chu T.W. Grant P.M. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15759-15764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the negative charges that were tolerated in F1-βATPase were placed in a proper amphiphilic position. An alternative explanation for the different results may reside in a model of structural compensation for charge deficiencies to be developed below. We have shown that not all of the positive charges in the leader of pALDH are required for import; R3Q, R10Q, R14Q, R17Q, and R14Q(R17Q) are all functional leaders under in vitro conditions (15Hammen P.K. Waltner M. Hahnemann B. Heard T.S. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21041-21048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The double mutant R3Q(R10Q) was import impaired and led to the suggestion of the necessity of at least one positive charge in the N-helical segment. Both Arg3 and Arg10 are required for the S7E mutant to function properly. A likely explanation for the ability of the leader to tolerate the S7E substitution is that the N-helical segment retains a sufficient, net positive charge. As summarized in Table I, the S7E mutant is equivalent in N-helical segment charge to the mutants of R3Q and R10Q. The mutants R3Q(S7E) and R10Q(S7E) are equivalent to that of R3Q(R10Q) in that all three display a net charge of 0 in the N-terminal helical segment. Arguments for a net positive charge requirement in the N-terminal helical segment were strengthened by the results obtained from the S7E(R11E) and S7E(R14E) mutants. For both the S7E(R11E) and S7E(R14E) mutants, the overall charge of the leader was reduced from +5 to +2. The S7E(R14E) mutant displayed greater import and even surpassed the import level of the linker-deleted structure. The introduction of the two negative charges in the S7E(R14E) mutant may have potentially improved the stability of the leader through a network of electrostatic interactions within the leader, as illustrated in Fig. 3 and suggested by the circular dichroism experiments. In the S7E(R11E) mutant, the presence of a negative charge was more likely influencing the net charge of the N-terminal helical segment, even though it is not part of the structure determined from the native leader determined by NMR (16Karslake C. Piotto M.E. Pak Y.K. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9872-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Removing both positive charges from either the N-terminal helical segment or the C-terminal helical segment of the aldehyde dehydrogenase leader sequence impaired import. However, deleting the linker from the R3Q(R10Q) or R14Q(R17Q) mutants restored import. This was also found for the R3Q(S7E) and R10Q(S7E) mutants. The more stable helix, produced by removing the linker, appeared to overcome charge deficits in that it restored import when arginines were substituted by glutamines. Although the linker-deleted leader could compensate for the reduction of positive charges, the level of import depended upon whether a positive or negative charge was the first charged residue in the sequence. The S7D mutant of pALDH was not imported as well as the S7E mutant. A structural investigation on a peptide corresponding to the S7D leader showed no apparent loss in the ability of the peptide to be induced to a helical structure as compared with the native peptide. There are two plausible explanations for the observation that the S7D precursor mutant is import deficient, yet structurally stable. Firstly, the glutamic acid residue of S7E is capable of extending the charge toward a hydrophilic environment, but the charge on the shorter aspartate residue is unable to extend away from what may be a hydrophobic environment. If the N-terminal helix of pALDH begins to interact amphiphilically with the receptor proteins, the negative charge on the aspartate residue may be placed in an unfavorable hydrophobic environment. The glutamic acid and arginine residues are capable of proper extension and potential ion paring, which may shield opposing charge effects and add a favorable, albeit small, energetic contribution to helix stability. An alternative, related explanation for the reduced import of the S7D mutant could be that the charge was not effectively shielded through potential electrostatic interactions with the two arginines in the leader. From the results of this study, we propose a model to explain how negative charges may be tolerated in the leader sequence of pALDH. Introducing a negative charge into the N-terminal helical segment reduces the net charge of the helix in much the same manner that was observed when the positive charges were substituted with glutamines in absence of negative charges. Provided that a net positive charge is maintained in the N-helical segment, negative charges are tolerated, and import is maintained. When the presence of a negative charge reduces the net charge of the N-terminal helical segment to 0, import is impaired but can be restored by increasing the length and stability of the leader. Although more structural information and import properties are needed from other leader sequences that naturally contain negative charges, the model is consistent with our previous studies that have shown structure to be an important contributor to offset any reduction in positive charge. If our model is correct, mitochondrial leader sequences that naturally contain a number of negative charges such as isopropyl malate synthase may have a greater capacity to form a longer, more stable helix than those that are richer in positive charges."

This process is important to control their expression on the cell surface and requires sorting in early endocytic compartments. Little is known about the mechanisms and the signals involved. We have studied the signal involved in targeting the interleukin 2 receptor β chain (IL2Rβ), a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, toward degradation after internalization. We show that a motif of 8 amino acids in the cytosolic tail of IL2Rβ is sufficient to target a normally recycling receptor toward degradation. Deletion of this signal strongly impairs IL2Rβ degradation. Further molecular characterization of the motif shows that it does not resemble the well documented tyrosine and dileucine families of trafficking signals.

Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a process used by cells for rapid and specific uptake of extracellular macromolecules. After their internalization from the plasma membrane, receptors travel from one organelle to another. They may recycle back to the cell surface, thus following the default pathway, or reach other compartments such as late endosomes and lysosomes, the trans-Golgi network, or other specialized compartments. Sorting may take place at several steps during this journey, to ensure that each receptor reaches its proper destination (1Mellmann I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Sorting mechanisms described to date involve short amino acid sequences carried by the cytosolic region of the membrane protein to be routed. A large majority of these motifs, which target receptors to various intracellular compartments, resemble the well described internalization signals, which allow receptors to interact with clathrin-coated pits (2Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). They have been classified in two groups, a tyrosine-based motif and a dileucine-based motif (3Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Many internalization signals have now been described, but much less is known about the characteristics of the motifs involved in targeting to late endocytic compartments and to lysosomes. Most of our knowledge comes from studies on lysosomal membrane glycoproteins. After synthesis, these proteins either are directly targeted from thetrans-Golgi network to endosomes and lysosomes, or first appear on the cell surface before reaching their final destination. Sequences necessary for targeting lysosomal membrane glycoproteins to lysosomes have been described by mutation analysis (reviewed in Ref.4Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). They belong to the tyrosine or dileucine families of signals described for clathrin-coated pit endocytosis. Usually, when these signals are mutated, both the information for endocytosis and for targeting to lysosomes are lost. Sequences necessary for internalization and degradation of a few nonlysosomal membrane proteins have been reported and are also similar to these internalization motifs, i.e. CD4, CD3 γ and δ, HLA-DM, and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1 associated invariant chain (5Shin J. Dunbrack Jr R.L. Lee S. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10658-10665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Letourneur F. Klausner R.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An important category of membrane proteins that are also targeted to late endocytic compartments after endocytosis are the growth factor receptors. In this case, degradation of the receptors plays an important role in controlling their expression and consequently the cellular response to growth factors. Little is known about the motifs involved in their sorting. The cytokine interleukin 2 (IL2) is produced by activated helper T lymphocytes and stimulates proliferation and effector functions of a variety of cells of the immune system. High affinity IL2 receptors (K d ≈ 10–100 pm) are composed of three distinct components, the α, β, and γ chains, which are associated in a noncovalent manner (9Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the β and γ chains, but not the α chain, belong to the cytokine receptor superfamily (10Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). This hematopoietic cytokine receptor family includes receptors for several cytokines, for erythropoietin, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, the leukemia inhibitory factor, growth hormone, prolactin, and ciliary neurotrophic factor. Many receptor subfamily members share at least one component; thus, the receptors for IL2, -4, -7, -9, and -15 have a common γ chain, and the receptors for IL2 and IL15 share the β chain (reviewed in Ref. 11Sugamura K. Asao H. Kondo M. Tanaka N. Ishii N. Ohbo K. Nakamura M. Takeshita T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). One of the early events following IL2 binding to high affinity receptors on the cell surface is the internalization of IL2 receptor complexes (12Duprez V. Cornet V. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12860-12865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Subtil A. Hémar A. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After endocytosis, the components of this multimolecular receptor have different intracellular fates: one of the chains, α, recycles to the plasma membrane, while the others, β and γ, are routed to late endocytic compartments (14Hémar A. Subtil A. Lieb M. Morelon E. Hellio R. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the interleukin 2 receptor β chain (IL2Rβ) is constitutively endocytosed and degraded when expressed in cells lacking the α or the γ chains (15Hémar A. Lieb M. Subtil A. DiSanto J.P. Dautry-Varsat A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1951-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A truncated form of IL2Rβ, β27, composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains followed by the first 27 cytosolic amino acids out of 286, is also efficiently internalized and degraded (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have reported that the β27 construct carries several weak internalization signals within the transmembrane and cytosolic domains, acting in an additive fashion (17Subtil A. Dautry-Varsat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, its cytosolic tail contains a signal that is sufficient to target a recycling receptor toward degradation (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we show that this signal is unique since, when it is deleted, IL2Rβ is no longer degraded. We have further characterized this sequence by mutational analysis. It does not have the characteristics of the tyrosine or dileucine families of signals. K562, a human erythroleukemia cell line, was grown in suspension in RPMI 1640, 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum, supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine. Stably transfected K562 cells were grown in the same medium supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml G418. Monoclonal antibodies 7G7B6 (IgG2a) or 2A3A1H (IgG1) directed against the α chain of the IL2 receptor were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) (18Rubin L.A. Kutman C.C. Fritz M.E. Biddison W.E. Boutin B. Yarchoan R. Nelson D.L. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3172-3177PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 341 (IgG1) and 561 (IgG2a), directed against IL2Rβ, were kind gifts from Dr R. Robb (Dupont Merck Pharmaceutical Co., Wilmington, DE) (19Voss S.D. Leary T.P. Sondel P.M. Robb R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2428-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat F(ab)′2 anti-murine IgG was obtained from Immunotech (Marseilles, France). All β27 mutants and αYβnm chimeras were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The truncated form of the β chain lacking cytosolic residues 22–27 (βΔ22–27) was constructed by PCR amplification of the β chain region, encompassing the extracellular and transmembrane domains plus the first 21 cytosolic amino acids. A NotI restriction site was introduced in the upstream primer. The downstream primer ATTGAGCTCGAGGGGTCTGGGGTGTTAC contained a SacI restriction site overlapping the junction between residue 21 and residues 28–29. The PCR product was cloned in the NT expression vector using the NotI/SacI restriction sites. The fragment coding for amino acid 28 to the last amino acid (286) of the β chain was then added using the uniqueSacI site in IL2Rβ cDNA. All kinetics and half-life analyses described here have been performed in stably transfected K562 cells. To generate stable transfectants, 7 × 106 K562 cells were washed once in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4.5 g/liter glucose and resuspended in 800 μl of the same medium, with 20 μg of the plasmid of interest. Electroporation was performed using the Easyject electroporator (Eurogentec) with a single pulse, 240 V, 1500 microfarads. Selection with 1.5 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) was initiated 2 days after transfection, and the cells were cloned in 96-well dishes. G418-resistant clones were assayed for expression by flow cytometry using anti-α (7G7B6) or anti-β (341) antibodies. The expression levels of recombinant proteins in all clones tested were the same or less than their normal level in activated lymphocytes. Internalization of the different β constructs was measured using radiolabeled anti-β antibody. Antibody 561 was radiolabeled with 125I by the chloramine T method to a specific activity of 2–10 μCi/μg. Cells (2 × 106) were incubated in 100 μl of RPMI-Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, at 37 °C, and 1–5 nm125I-labeled anti-β antibody was added. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times, the cells were rapidly cooled to 4 °C and washed twice. Cell surface-associated radioactive ligand was then removed by two successive acid pH treatments (2 min at pH 2.0) at 4 °C as described previously (20Duprez V. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15450-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding, measured for each ligand by adding a 100-fold excess of the same unlabeled ligand, was less than 10% and was subtracted. The efficiency of removal of cell surface-associated ligands by acid pH washes was measured for each ligand and was more than 90%. The data presented here thus show specific binding and internalization. In all figures, the ratio of intracellular to cell surface-associated125I-labeled antibody is represented. All experiments were done at least three times, with different clones expressing the same construct. The means ± S.E. are shown. Internalization of 2A3A1H antibodies directed against the αYβnm chimeras were quantitated by flow cytometry as described previously (21Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with 2A3A1H (1/200 ascites fluid). The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, and after incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times, rapidly cooled to 4 °C and washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat F(ab)′2 anti-murine IgG and washed once at 4 °C. Internalization was monitored by the decrease in mean fluorescence as a function of time at 37 °C. The background fluorescence intensity, determined with cells incubated only with the secondary antibody, was less than 10% and was subtracted. To measure the half-life on the cell surface of the different β27mutants or αYβnm chimeras, cells were incubated with cycloheximide to prevent the synthesis of new receptors. After different times of incubation at 37 °C in culture medium with 50 μm cycloheximide (Sigma), the cells were cooled to 4 °C, and cell surface expression of the constructs was assayed by flow cytometry as described (22Hémar A. Dautry-Varsat A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2629-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Time 0 on the graph corresponds to a 30-min incubation in cycloheximide, which is the time required for a newly synthesized IL2 receptor to reach the cell surface (20Duprez V. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15450-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were done at least four times, with different clones expressing the same construct. The means ± S.E. are shown. After internalization, IL2Rβ is targeted to late endocytic compartments and is degraded. We have previously described a 10-amino acid sequence, in its cytosolic domain, which functions as a sorting signal for the receptor (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). IL2Rβ cytosolic domain is 286 amino acids long and could contain more than one sorting signal. We constructed a mutated receptor in which an essential part of the signal we have characterized (amino acids 22–27) was deleted (βΔ22–27). To analyze the fate of this receptor during endocytosis, we measured its half-life on the cell surface when protein synthesis was inhibited. We have previously shown that, under these conditions, the loss of IL2Rβ from the cell surface can be equated with degradation as measured in a pulse-chase labeling experiment (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The half-life of βΔ22–27 on the cell surface was very long, more than 8 h, compared with that of IL2Rβ, 3 h (Fig. 1 A). This difference was not due to a defect in internalization since both proteins were internalized with similar kinetics (Fig. 1 B). This result indicates that βΔ22–27 is no longer sorted to late endocytic compartments, but is recycled back to the cell surface after internalization. Thus, IL2Rβ cytosolic domain contains a unique sorting signal that targets the receptor toward degradation after endocytosis. We have shown that IL2Rβ sorting signal functions in β27, a truncated form with only the first 27 cytosolic amino acids of IL2Rβ. We decided to better define IL2Rβ sorting signal by inserting point mutations in β27 and measuring the half-life on the cell surface of these mutant proteins. When protein synthesis is inhibited, disappearance of a membrane protein from the cell surface is the net result of two events: internalization from the cell surface and sorting out of the general recycling pathway in endosomes. The limiting step(s) in these processes are not known. If the endocytic rate is limiting, a decrease or an increase in the endocytic rate should increase or decrease the half-life of the protein on the cell surface, respectively. Analysis of different mutants showed that it was not the case. For example, β27ΔS25 or β27S25T (in which Ser-25 was deleted or replaced by a similar amino acid, threonine, respectively), were internalized about 2-fold slower than β27 (Fig. 2 A), but their half-life was the same as that of β27 (Fig. 2 B). A further decrease in endocytosis might affect the half-time on the cell surface, since the half-life of mutants that were internalized about 3-fold slower than β27, such as β27F24A and β27F24P, was increased by about 50%. We concluded that the rate of internalization was not the rate-limiting step for the net disappearance of β27 from the cell surface, but internalization might become limiting if reduced more than 2-fold. In any case, to characterize the intracellular sorting step, we will compare the half-life of mutants that are internalized with similar rates. This way, differences in half-lives between two mutants reflect a difference in sorting after endocytosis. Most sorting signals described to date resemble internalization motifs, and indeed also promote endocytosis. Although the IL2Rβ sorting signal is not by itself an internalization motif (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it contains two phenylalanines, which can sometimes replace tyrosine in tyrosine-based internalization signals. In the previously described cases, Tyr usually forms a better internalization signal than Phe, and other mutations at this position abolish the signal (23Davis C.G. van Driel I.R. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4075-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Canfield W.M. Johnson K.F. Ye R.D. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5682-5688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the two phenylalanines, only Phe-24 is part of a sequence that resembles tyrosine-based internalization motifs (26Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 27Boll W. Ohno H. Songyang Z. Rapoport I. Cantley L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5789-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Mutation of Phe-24 to a tyrosine resulted in an increase in endocytosis, while mutation to an alanine or a proline had the opposite effect, suggesting that Phe-24SQL could function as a weak internalization motif related to the tyrosine-based signal family (Fig. 3 A and Ref. 17Subtil A. Dautry-Varsat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, β27F24Y half-life on the cell surface was not accelerated compared with that of β27 (Fig. 3 B). The half-lives of β27F24A and β27F24P were increased by about 50%, a difference that might be entirely due to a defect in endocytosis and not in sorting, since the internalization rates for both mutants were more than 3-fold slower than that of β27 (Fig. 2). Thus, mutations known to produce stronger or weaker internalization signals, and which indeed had the expected effect on β27internalization, did not affect β27 sorting in a corresponding way. We concluded that IL2Rβ sorting signal does not have the same requirements as tyrosine-based internalization motifs. In our previous study, we had shown that the IL2Rβ sorting signal was comprised within amino acids 18–27 of its cytosolic domain. To better define this signal, we measured the half-life on the cell surface of β27 mutants in which amino acids within this sequence had been deleted or replaced by other residues. The internalization rates and half-lives of the mutants are reported in Fig. 3. Residues 18 and 19 do not seem to play a critical role in the sorting signal (for further details, see below and Fig. 4). We had previously reported that Pro-20 could be replaced by a leucine, without affecting sorting after endocytosis (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Deletion of Ser-21 or Lys-22 did not modify β27 half-life. These results suggest that amino acids 20–23 are not essential for the IL2Rβ sorting signal function. Mutation of Phe-23 to a tyrosine or an alanine increased the half-life of β27 to 165 and 250 min, respectively. This was not only due to a decrease in internalization compared with β27 since β27ΔS25, which was internalized with similar kinetics as β27F23Y and β27F23A, had a 125-min half-life. This result shows that Phe-23 is an important amino acid in IL2Rβ sorting signal. Its replacement by another aromatic amino acid impairs the signal only slightly, but replacement by an alanine increased the half-life of β27 2-fold. As reported above, mutation of Phe-24 to an alanine or a proline increased β27 half-life to 180 and 200 min, respectively, a delay that could be entirely due to a defect in internalization, since β27F24A and β27F24P are internalized about 3-fold slower than β27. The half-life of β27F24Y is slightly longer than that of β27, despite an accelerated rate of entry. Deletion or substitution of Ser-25 by a glycine had no effect on β27 half-life. Thus, Ser-25 is not an essential amino acid in IL2Rβ sorting signal. On the contrary, deletion or mutation of Gln-26 of β27 had a dramatic effect; the half-life of both constructs increased to about 400 min, while their internalization was faster than that of β27ΔS25. These results show that Gln-26 is important for the IL2Rβ sorting signal to function. Finally, we investigated the role of Leu-27 in this signal. The dramatic effect of its deletion (β26 half-life was more than 12 h) suggested that this residue played an essential role in IL2Rβ sorting signal (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Replacement of Leu-27 by an isoleucine slightly increased β27 half-life, while replacement by a proline and a threonine increased it about 2-fold. The internalization rates of β27L27P and β27L27T were lower than that of β27, but similar to that of β27ΔS25, and therefore do not account for the half-life increase. These results suggest that Leu-27 plays an essential role in IL2Rβ sorting signal. In our previous study, we had shown that a 10-amino acid sequence in IL2Rβ was sufficient to mediate sorting of a recycling receptor, αY, toward degradation (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The αY chimera was constructed by inserting the transferrin receptor internalization motif at the carboxyl-end of the IL2 receptor α chain cytosolic domain. We have shown that this chimera was efficiently internalized and recycled back to the cell surface. In contrast, αYβ18–27, in which amino acids 18–27 from IL2Rβ had been added to the cytosolic domain of αY, was sorted toward degradation after internalization. We constructed a shorter chimera, αYβ20–27. Its half-life on the cell surface was the same as that of αYβ18–27, 200 min, showing that IL2Rβ sorting signal can be limited to 8 amino acids (Fig. 4). Studies on the β27 mutants presented here suggested that, within these 8 residues, amino acids between Phe-23 and Leu-27 were important for sorting. We prepared a chimera between αY and these 5 amino acids, αYβ23–27. While αYβ23–27 was as efficiently internalized as the αYβ20–27 chimera, its half-life on the cell surface was 350 min, indicating that its sorting was impaired (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, only 4 amino acids separate23FFSQL27 from the YTRF internalization signal in αYβ23–27, while in αYβ20–27 there is a 7-amino acid spacing between the two signals. A minimal spacing between these two motifs might be necessary for the sorting signal to function. To test this hypothesis, we studied the trafficking of a chimera with a three-alanine spacer between the internalization and lysosomal sorting signals, αYAAAβ23–27. This chimera was internalized with the same kinetics as αYβ20–27 but was poorly degraded, showing that the difference in spacing between the two signals is not sufficient to account for the prolonged half-life of the αYβ23–27 chimera. The IL2Rβ chain is constitutively internalized and targeted to late endocytic compartments, where it is degraded (14Hémar A. Subtil A. Lieb M. Morelon E. Hellio R. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We had previously shown that amino acids 18–27 of the IL2Rβ cytosolic domain are sufficient to target a recycling receptor toward degradation. Here, we show that this signal is unique in the IL2Rβ, and that it is comprised within amino acids 20–27. We further characterize this sorting signal by mutational analysis. Several sorting signals have been described since the identification of the low density lipoprotein receptor internalization motif 12 years ago (28Davis C.G. Lehrman M.A. Russel D.W. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1986; 45: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Most of them fall into two categories: the tyrosine- and the dileucine-based motifs. These families have been first described and best characterized in the case of the internalization signals, but are also encountered as signals for sorting to the trans-Golgi network, to late endocytic compartments, to MHC class-II compartments, or for polarized sorting (for reviews, see Refs. 3Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 4Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, and 26Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). An important characteristic of these signals is that, in addition to a specific sorting step, they also promote internalization from the plasma membrane. In some cases, several signals are found in the same receptor and can have an additive effect. Another important feature is that these signals do not consist of a fixed amino acid sequence, but are relatively flexible. Some positions in the signal, such as the tyrosine itself, or one leucine, tolerate only very limited change, while others are less restricted. Our study allows to draw a comparison between the IL2Rβ sorting signal and the other well documented trafficking signals. On one hand, the IL2Rβ sorting signal shares many properties with other trafficking motifs. It is also a short amino acid sequence, which functions in different protein surroundings (here the IL2Rβ or αy), and which tolerates limited change in its composition. Leu-27 is clearly an essential residue in this signal, since even a conservative substitution, by an isoleucine, slightly increased the half-life of β27L27I, a defect that was further enhanced by substitution by a proline or a threonine, and since deletion of Leu-27 totally impaired sorting (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Deletion or mutation of Gln-26 increased the half-life of β27 more than 3-fold, showing that Gln-26 is important for the signal to function. Serine 25, which could be deleted or replaced by a glycine without any consequence on the half-life, is not a crucial residue. The same seems to be true for Ser-21 and Lys-22, whose deletion did not affect sorting, and for Pro-20, which could be replaced by a leucine (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Phe-23 and Phe-24 could each be replaced by another aromatic residue, a tyrosine, with only a small increase in the half-life. Replacement by an alanine further impaired sorting, especially in β27F23A, whose half-life was twice as long as that of β27, suggesting that these aromatic residues play a role in the signal function. In summary, our results show the importance of the FFSQL motif for lysosomal targeting of IL2Rβ, residues Phe-23, Gln-26, and Leu-27 being critical within this motif. Another feature of IL2Rβ sorting signal common to other trafficking motifs is that many of these signals are not extremely efficient, but perform their function in an iterative manner. We measured that half of the cell surface IL2Rβ gets internalized in about 20 min, while the half-life of the receptor on the cell surface is about 180 min. Cycloheximide, used in the half-life measurement, does not slow receptor entry (data not shown). These results imply that the IL2Rβ recycles several times between the cell surface and endosomes before it gets sorted to late endocytic compartments. The same is true for the lysosomal proteins that are delivered to the plasma membrane before being sorted to lysosomes, and for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (29Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 30Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30340-30346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We had previously shown that IL2Rβ sorting signal is part of an α-helix (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Again, several other trafficking motifs have also been located to structured domains of receptors, either in α-helix or in β-turns (8Motta A. Bremnes B. Morelli M.A.C. Frank R.W. Saviano G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Bansal A. Gierasch L.M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2257-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Another point in common is that in none of these examples is it known whether the structure is important for the signal to function. In vitro studies, on the recognition of internalization motifs placed in different protein environments, suggest that the surrounding amino acids, which will determine the overall structure, are not important for the signal recognition (27Boll W. Ohno H. Songyang Z. Rapoport I. Cantley L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5789-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Here we found that replacement of Ser-25 by a glycine did not affect sorting. Secondary structure predictions using AGADIR program (36Munoz Serano Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), allowing to detect the α-helix tendencies of peptides, showed that the α-helix is very likely disrupted in the β27S25G mutant. This result therefore suggests that IL2Rβ sorting signal structure is not important for its function, as long as it is accessible to the cell machinery that recognizes it. In this respect, it is interesting to note that IL2Rβ sorting signal is more efficient at the COOH-terminal end of β27 (half-life ∼ 130 min) than in IL2Rβ cytosolic tail (half-life ∼ 180 min). A carboxyl-terminal location is also found in most, if not all, lysosomal proteins, and it has been suggested that this location promotes signal recognition and subsequently enzyme transport to the lysosomes (37Ohno H. Fournier M.-C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the IL2Rβ sorting signal differs in several ways from the trafficking motifs described so far. First, although it includes a F24SQL sequence, reminiscent of tyrosine-based sequences, we show here that IL2Rβ sorting signal does not share the requirements of this category of signals. Mutation of Phe-24 to a tyrosine increased the endocytic rate of the mutant, without decreasing its half-life. Interestingly, the replacement of the tyrosine in the LAMP1 motif by alanine was shown to impair targeting to lysosomes (38Höning S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In our case, mutation to an alanine increased the half-life only slightly, a difference that could be entirely due to the 3-fold decrease on the endocytic rates of this mutant. Second, the IL2Rβ sorting signal is not by itself an internalization motif (16Subtil A. Delepierre M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The observation that βΔ22–27, in which it is deleted, is internalized with similar kinetics as IL2Rβ also shows that this sequence is not critical for the receptor internalization. However, we have shown that β27 internalization is promoted by several sequences in its cytosolic and transmembrane domains, and this sorting signal, together with other sequences, may also be involved in βwt internalization (17Subtil A. Dautry-Varsat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Third, transmembrane proteins often contain several signals, which seem to have redundant roles in targeting (39Chang C.-P. Lazar C.S. Walsh B.J. Komuro M. Collawn J.F. Kuhn L.A. Tainer J.A. Trowbridge I.S. Farquhar M.G. Rosenfeld M.G. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19312-19320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Johnson K.F. Chan W. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10010-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 41Ponnambalam S. Rabouille C. Luzio J.P. Nilsson T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This redundancy has also been illustrated in the sorting toward degradation of the EGF receptor and of the γ and δ chains of the T cell receptor (6Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 30Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4325-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although IL2Rβ cytosolic domain is quite large, it contains a unique signal for sorting to degradation after endocytosis, since the receptor is no longer degraded when this signal is deleted in βΔ22–27. This last characteristic seems to be shared by some other cytokine receptors, the γ chain of the IL2R, the gp130 chain of the IL6 receptor (43Morelon E. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22044-22051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 44Dittrich E. Haft C.R. Muys L. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5487-5494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A novel lysosomal targeting signal has been recently characterized within the cytosolic tail of P-selectin (45Green S.A. Setiadi H. McEver R.P. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 46Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Norcott J.P. Cutler D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2729-2737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It shares some features with the IL2Rβ sorting signal; it does not belong to the tyrosine- or dileucine-based families, it does not function as an internalization motif, and it appears to be the unique degradation signal. This sorting signal (KCPL) shares no obvious sequence homology with that of IL2Rβ (FFSQL). Very little is known about the cellular machinery responsible for targeting membrane proteins to late endocytic compartments and lysosomes. Lysosomal proteins might be sorted to lysosomes directly from thetrans-Golgi network by interaction of their sorting motif with the μ1 chain of AP-1 adaptors (47Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 48Honing S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The EGF receptor has been the principal model to study plasma membrane receptor degradation after endocytosis. Identification of a protein that interacts with its lysosomal targeting code has been reported, but it might be specific for this receptor (49Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). COPI proteins, known for their role in intra-Golgi transport, might also be involved in endosome function, but the protein(s) that interact specifically with sorting signal remain to be identified (50Schekman R. Mellman I. Cell. 1997; 90: 197-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 51Aniento F. Gu F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 52Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Sheff D. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The location where the signals for sorting to late endocytic compartments are recognized is also unknown. It is generally accepted that membrane proteins, even internalized by different pathways, reach a common endosome (53Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this compartment, sorting physically occurs; membrane proteins carrying trafficking signals are targeted according to this information toward different compartments, while signal-free proteins are trafficked to the recycling endosome by a default mechanism, and then back to the cell surface (54Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Sorting signals might be recognized in the sorting endosome, but not necessarily. Recognition could also take place earlier in the endocytic pathway, even before internalization proceeds. This model is supported by our observation that the endocytic rate is not, to some extent, a limiting factor for degradation, in agreement with another report (55Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B. Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 907-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For example, β27, which was internalized 2-fold faster than β27ΔS25, was not degraded faster. If the signal recognition took place after internalization, one could expect that a faster rate of entry, which results in a higher intracellular distribution at equilibrium, would favor signal recognition and therefore degradation. However, if sorting signals were recognized at the plasma membrane, this step would be favored in slowly internalized receptor, a positive effect that could compensate for the negative effect of slow internalization. The identification and characterization of the molecular signals that target membrane proteins toward degradation compartments is only at its beginning. Our detailed study on the IL2Rβ chain degradation signal may help to identify similar signals in other receptors. It may also open the way to the identification of the cellular components that interact with this signal. We are grateful to Dr. M. Delepierre for computer simulation, and we thank Drs. C.

Kinesin molecular motors have twin motor domains, or “heads,” and “walk” along microtubules (MTs),1 touching down with alternate heads to binding sites spaced 8 nm apart along the microtubule protofilament axis. It is unknown if walking occurs in tightrope fashion along a single microtubule protofilament or whether kinesin can straddle between two protofilaments. But in either case, the two heads must be coordinated such that each can alternately detach and search for a binding site, while the other remains attached and acts as a holdfast. Runs of 100 or more steps are typical of unloaded kinesin (1Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 2Vale R.D. Funatsu T. Pierce D.W.

Some degree of guidance or conformational restriction is presumably applied by the trailing head to the leading head, such that the leading head binds to the correct site on the microtubule, in the productive direction and in line, so as to maintain its characteristically accurate axial tracking (3Ray S. Meyhofer E. Milligan R.A. Howard J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). At the same time, the free head needs a considerable degree of conformational freedom to allow it to stretch and attach to the new binding site, transiently developing the “bridge” (both heads attached) structure that defines walking (4Howard J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 703-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 5Crevel I.M. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Cross R.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 631-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the head-tail junction, the two kinesin heads are joined at their C termini to a rodlike tail built predominantly from α-helical coiled coil. The original crystal structure of the monomeric human kinesin head in complex with MgADP (7Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) had as its most C-terminal feature the helix α6, the extreme C terminus of the head being disordered and therefore invisible. The more recent two-headed crystal structure of rat kinesin (8Kozielski F. Sack S. Marx A. Thormahlen M. Schonbrunn E. Biou V. Thompson A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 91: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), also in complex with MgADP, reveals the head-tail junction in more detail. The coiled coil tail starts at Ala339. Between the end of α6 and Ala339, the chain folds into two short β-strands, β9 and β10. C-terminal to Ala339, and beyond the region visible in the crystals, the coiled coil structure of the tail is predicted to be interrupted by Pro/Gly-rich insertions, which may trigger local unwinding and strand separation of the tail. Strand separation has been proposed as a possible basis for the ability of the molecule to bridge between adjacent binding sites on the MT (5Crevel I.M. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar); there is, however, no direct evidence for it. Studies on isolated peptides tended, on the contrary, to indicate that two-chain dimers were remarkably stable (11Morii H. Takenawa T. Arisaka F. Shimizu T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Tripet B. Vale R.D. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8946-8956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but the possibility of local unwinding nonetheless remains (13Block S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More recently, mutation of the neck region of kinesin in an attempt to stabilize the coiled coil structure of the kinesin neck did not affect the ability of the molecule to walk (step repetitively) between binding sites (14Romberg L. Pierce D.W. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Presumably, the relatively complex structure of the region surrounding the head-tail junction of kinesin (5Crevel I.M. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reflects a requirement for this region to somehow satisfy conflicting conformational demands: it must be flexible enough to facilitate the diffusional search made by the leading head for its imminent binding site and yet stiff enough to support strain as the kinesin molecule exerts traction force on the microtubule. Recent work has revealed that attachment of the head of ncd, a MT minus end-directed motor, to the tail of nkin, a kinesin-like plus end-directed motor, can force the ncd head to reverse its normal direction of movement and move toward MT plus ends (15Henningsen U. Schliwa M. Nature. 1997; 389: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Cross R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is thus clear that the structure of the head-tail attachment can profoundly influence the action of the motor. On the other hand, Inoue et al. (17Inoue Y. Toyoshima Y.Y. Iwane A.H. Morimoto S. Higuchi H. Yanagida T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7275-7280Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have reported rapid and efficient motion of bead-kinesin complexes along MTs when the kinesin heads were attached to the beads via a flexible linker fused in at residue 340, which suggests that structuring of the region immediately C-terminal to 340 is unnecessary for efficient movement. Relevant also are experiments from the Gelles laboratory, in which it was shown that kinesin single heads fused at residue 340 to a biotinated protein drive MT sliding only slowly (0.09 μm s−1) compared with the typical rate for longer, dimeric constructs (0.75 μm s−1; 26 °C) (18Young E.C. Mahtani H.K. Gelles J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3467-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Broadly, two kinds of physical mechanism have been proposed for the cross-bridge action of molecular motors: those based on directionally biased capture by the track of a thermally diffusing cross-bridge (19Huxley A.F. Prog. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1957; 7: 257-318Crossref Google Scholar) and those based on force-producing conformational changes that occur in the cross-bridge following attachment to the track (20Huxley A.F. Simmons R.M. Nature. 1971; 233: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). A schematic diagram exemplifying the potential involvement of these two sorts of process in the stepping action of kinesin is shown in Fig. 1. The tethered diffusion of the leading head occurs prior to capture by the microtubule and is relatively insensitive to the presence or absence of a lever arm. The tilting and subsequent conformational change that may follow attachment to the microtubule will have their effective amplitude amplified by any lever arm. For both kinesin and myosin, the general problem of the molecular motor mechanism is to understand the contribution of these two processes and specifically the protein-structural pathway via which the turnover of nucleotide in the motor active site drives the mechanical cycle. The lever arm theory for myosin action relates to the force-producing conformational change type of mechanism, whereby following binding of the myosin head to its actin track, a force-producing conformational shift occurs which is amplified by the swinging action of a lever arm that is rigidly attached to the head (21Holmes K.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R112-R118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For kinesin, the relative importance in the mechanism of these two types of process, rectified diffusion and conformational change, is not currently clear, but for the related myosin motor, the need for some sort of structured lever arm at the head-tail junction is more evident. There is evidence that the neck region (the light chain binding domain) of myosins acts as a mechanical amplifier, a semi-rigid cantilever arm, which swings through an arc of several tens of degrees in response to conformational changes within the head which are in turn driven by the ADP and/or Pi release steps of ATP turnover (21Holmes K.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R112-R118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments to test this idea, the putative lever arm of myosin has been lengthened mutagenically, by inserting an artificial lever arm consisting of copies of the putatively rigid α-actinin rod repeat (22Anson M. Geeves M.A. Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or extra copies of the wild type light chain binding domain (23Uyeda T.Q. Abramson P.D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Both experiments produced an increase (respectively 1.3-fold for a doubling of lever length and 2.6-fold for a 3-fold increase in lever length) in unloaded sliding velocity. In the case of the Uyeda et al.experiments (23Uyeda T.Q. Abramson P.D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), the increase was linearly proportional to the predicted lever arm length. A lever arm mechanism thus seems plausible in the myosin case, although definitive proof is still being sought (24Block S.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The experiments described here are loosely modeled on those described above for myosin. We probed for a lever arm action in kinesin by extending the presumptive lever arm (the region of the tail closest to the head) using protein engineering. If a lever arm action is involved in the kinesin mechanism, then lengthening this region should accelerate the motor in proportion to the total length of the lever arm, as was observed for myosin. In seminal work, Goldstein and colleagues (41Stewart R.J. Thaler J.P. Goldstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5209-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) coupled the kinesin head to part of the rodlike tail of Drosophila spectrin, making the junction at residue 448 of Drosophila kinesin, and showed that the chimera was active in MT sliding assays. In the current experiments, we worked with kinesin-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions in which the tail was truncated to various extents, close to the head-tail junction now shown to be at Ala339. We inserted into these a rigid extension piece consisting of the central two sequence repeats of the four-repeat chick embryo α-actinin rod domain and compared the performance of the truncated constructs with and without the inserted α-actinin module. For the dimeric constructs, this insertional mutagenesis produced maximally only a relatively modest increase in velocity (125% of wild type), despite an estimated ∼11-nm increase in predicted lever arm length (see below). The expression vector used for this study for production of kinesin-GST fusion and for kinesin-α-actinin-GST fusions was a pET 17b (Novagen)-based bacterial vector that had been modified by inserting a PCR-amplified GST sequence at the EcoRI restriction site of the multicloning site of the vector. The vector fuses the GST protein C-terminally to the various motor truncations, which were inserted between theNdeI and EcoRI sites (5Crevel I.M. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All PCR reactions were performed according to Lockhart et al. (38Lockhart A. Crevel I.M. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Kinesin inserts corresponding to amino acids 1–340, 1–376, and 1–401 were PCR-amplified from the original rat kinesin heavy chain clone (a kind gift of Dr. Scott Brady and Ann Sperry) with 5′-CCGCTCTACATATGGCGGACCCAGCCGAATGCAGC-3′ as the forward primer and the following reverse primers: for K340, 5′-ACCTCTGAATTCTGCTGTTAGTTCC-3′ (producing a 1020-base pair fragment); for K376, 5′-ACCGGAGAATTCCACAGCTTCCCCGTTCCT-3′ (producing a 1128-base pair fragment); for K401, 5′-ACCCCGGAATTCGTTGTCTATGATGGGTGTGTT-3′ (producing a 1203-base pair fragment). The forward primer introduced an NdeI site 5′ of residue 1 to generate an in frame translation initiation codon. The reverse primers introduced an EcoRI site at the 3′-ends. The amplified products were purified from an agarose gel, cut withNdeI/RI, and ligated into the NdeI/RI-cut pET17bGST vector. Kinesins (K∂340, K∂376, and K∂401) were PCR-amplified with 5′-CCGCTCTACATATGGCGGACCCAGCCGAATGCAGC-3′ as the forward primer and either 5′-ACCTCTGAGCTCTGCTGTTAGTTCC-3′ (for K∂340) or 5′-ACCGGAGAGCTCCACAGCTTCCCCGTTCCT-3′ (for K∂376) or 5′-ACCCCGGAGCTCGTTGTCTATGATGGGTGTGTT-3′(for K∂401) as reverse primers. The forward primers inserted an NdeI site at the 5′-end of the kinesin. The reverse primers added a SacI site at the 3′-end of the truncated C termini of the kinesins. After amplification, all of the kinesin fragments were cut withNdeI/SacI and were ligated into pET 17b vector (Novagen), which had been cut with NdeI/SacI. Following ligation, the constructs were digested withSacI/RI in preparation for ligation to the α-actinin insert. The α-actinin insert was PCR-amplified from the original chick embryo α-actinin clone (27Baron M.D. Davison M.D. Jones P. Patel B. Critchley D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2558-2561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 5′-ACCGAGCTCGAGATCCGGAGGCTAGAGAGGCTG-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-AATCCGGAATTCCCTTCTAGGAACCAGCTGCCG-3′ as the reverse primer. The forward primer introduced a SacI site, and the reverse primer introduced an EcoRI site. The amplified insert corresponded to amino acids 385–615 of the α-actinin clone, the two central repeats of the rod. The insert was cut with SacI/R1 and ligated to each of the three above-described SacI/R1-cut pET17b kinesin plasmids. Following ligation, these plasmids were again digested with NdeI/RI to excise the α-actinin-kinesin fusions and ligated into the above describedNdeI/R1-cleaved pET17bGST vector. The engineering of the SacI site introduced two extra amino acid codons (corresponding to EL) at the kinesin-α-actinin junction. Tubulin was prepared from porcine brain as described by Lockhart and Cross (28Lockhart A. Cross R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Microtubules were assembled by the addition of MgCl2 to 2 mm and GTP to 1 mm, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and stabilized by adding taxol to 10 μm. For expression of the recombinant proteins, a single colony of freshly transformed competent BL-21(DE3) cells was grown overnight to saturation in liquid 2× YT medium (with 100 μg/ml ampicillin). The next morning, the overnight culture was diluted 1:50 into prewarmed 2× YT (Difco) medium and grown to an A 590 of 1.0. The culture was then cooled to 22 °C over a period of 30 min with shaking and subsequently induced with 0.8 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and shaken for a further 4 h at 22 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cell pellets were stored in a −70 °C freezer. For preparation of the protein, the thawed pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing additionally 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol (GST column buffer), supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor tablets (Boehringer Mannheim) (1 tablet/30 ml of buffer). For more labile proteins, extra leupeptin and aprotinin were added. The cell suspension was incubated on ice with lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) for 15–20 min followed by the addition of 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 and DNase I (40 μg/ml) and further incubation for 10 min on ice. The cell-free supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 27,000 ×g. This supernatant was incubated with 5–7 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech, UK) equilibrated with GST column buffer, on a roller at 4 °C for 30–40 min, and the beads were then packed into a column. The beads were first washed with 10 volumes of the GST column buffer and then 5 volumes of Hi-Trap Q column buffer, comprising 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The bound protein was eluted with 20 mm GSH, pH 7.0, in Hi-Trap Q column buffer, and the pooled eluate was loaded onto a 1-ml Q column at a rate of 1 ml/min. Hi-Trap Q chromatography was performed with an FPLC system (Pharmacia). The column was washed with 10 volumes of Q column buffer and then 5 volumes each of 0.1 m, 0.2m, and 0.3 m NaCl in Q column buffer. Most of the protein eluted at 0.2 m NaCl. The purity of the eluted protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and peak fractions were pooled; mixed with 15% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml of α-casein, and 100 μm ATP; frozen; and stored in liquid nitrogen in small aliquots. The concentrations of the purified expressed proteins were determined spectrophotometrically (29Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Proteins stored this way were active indefinitely. Once thawed, the protein aliquots were used immediately and never refrozen. Analytical gel filtration chromatography was done in sample storage buffer supplemented with 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP using a Superose 6 column, and a 500-μl sample loop. The column was run at 0.2 ml/min, and the absorbance of the eluate was monitored atA 280 running the recorder chart at 0.5 cm/ml. 0.2-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Motility assays for all of the constructs were carried out according to Ref. 30Cross R.A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998: 317-325Google Scholar in PEMD buffer (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol). 0.2 mg/ml α-casein (Sigma) was added to the protein samples as soon as they were thawed. 10–15-μl flow cells were constructed from uncleaned glass coverslips supported on two strips of Scotch Magic tape and coated using casein-containing motor at concentrations of 10–30 μm at room temperature (normally 23 °C) for 5–6 min. The flow cells were then rinsed with PEMD buffer freshly supplemented with 1 mm ATP, followed by perfusion with a suspension of 1 μm MT in the same buffer supplemented with 20 μm taxol. After a few seconds, the flow cell was rinsed with PEMD plus 1 mm ATP and mounted on the microscope stage. The microscope was an upright Nikon Microphot SA with standard DIC transmission optics and a Nikon 60 × 1.4 NA DIC objective, illuminated using light from a 100-watt mercury arc lamp fed through a fiber optic light scrambler (Technical Video, Woods Hole). At the input end of the scrambler, the light was filtered by reflection from a dichroic mirror to remove infrared and at the output end by a green interference filter. The DIC slider was set close to extinction, and the image was further magnified using an in line 2× lens and an in line zoom ocular to produce a 22 μm square field at the CCD camera faceplate. The video signal was real time background-subtracted and contrast-enhanced using a Hamamatsu Argus 20, and then recorded simultaneously to SVHS video tape and (in time lapse) to a PC hard disc via a frame grabbing card controlled from the RETRAC package (see Ref.30Cross R.A. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998: 317-325Google Scholar). The temperature of the specimens was clamped by flowing temperature-controlled water through soft copper tubes, which were wrapped around the objective and stage. The microscope and stage were wrapped in cling film to restrict air flow over the specimen, and the actual temperature of the flow cell was monitored by insertion of a thermocouple probe. For each temperature assayed, a new flow cell was prepared. For each data point, at least three different 20-frame clips, each from a different field, were grabbed. Tracking was done using the RETRAC package as described previously (5Crevel I.M. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). RETRAC calculates an updated S.D. of the mean velocity for each additional x, y data point, and tracking was continued (more fields were analyzed) until this value stabilized. In the velocityversus temperature plots, the error bars for this S.D. fall within the data points. The current experiments were modeled on the earlier work on myosin lever arm extension by Anson and colleagues (22Anson M. Geeves M.A. Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), in which part of the rodlike central domain of α-actinin was used as the lever arm extension. It is clear from recent electron microscopy (31Winkler J. Lunsdorf H. Jockusch B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and from a series of solution studies (32Gilmore A.P. Parr T. Patel B. Gratzer W.B. Critchley D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Flood G. Kahana E. Gilmore A.P. Rowe A.J. Gratzer W.B. Critchley D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Flood G. Rowe A.J. Critchley D.R. Gratzer W.B. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that the four central ∼106-residue pseudorepeats of α-actinin fold up into four quasi-independent “beads” within a rodlike domain. The detailed pattern of backfolding of the primary chain into the four presumed spectrin-like triple coiled coil structural repeats is unknown but is presumed to be similar to that of spectrin (35Pascual J. Castresana J. Saraste M. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), for which a crystal structure is available (36Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It is believed for α-actinin that the antiparallel dimerization of the intact α-actinin molecule is due to the interaction of pseudorepeats 1 and 4. We used the central pseudorepeats 2 and 3 (using the operational repeat boundaries defined by Critchley (33Flood G. Kahana E. Gilmore A.P. Rowe A.J. Gratzer W.B. Critchley D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Flood G. Rowe A.J. Critchley D.R. Gratzer W.B. Eur. Biophys.

Trans. 1995; 23: 399SCrossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar)) of chick embryo α-actinin, on the grounds that these should form a stable, elongated, freely soluble and non-self-associating module. This rodlike module corresponds approximately to the Dictyostelium α-actinin module used by Anson et al. in the myosin experiments (22Anson M. Geeves M.A. Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), allowing the two sets of data reasonably to be compared. The correspondence is not exact, however; the work by Anson et al. (22Anson M. Geeves M.A. Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) used repeat 1 or repeat 1 plus 2 of Dictyostelium α-actinin, whereas here we have used repeat 2 plus 3 of chick α-actinin. The module used here was confirmed in FPLC gel filtration experiments to be soluble and non-self-associating when bacterially expressed as a C-terminal fusion to GST (not shown). The guest α-actinin module was inserted into the kinesin neck at three points, as shown in Fig. 2 A; the sequences of the kinesin-α-actinin junctions are shown in Fig. 2. The purity of the expressed, purified proteins was checked using SDS microslab electrophoresis and is shown in Fig. 3. The physical state of association of the proteins was examined using analytical gel filtration. We were particularly concerned to check for combined effects of truncation of the kinesin and insertion of the α-actinin spacer module on the aggregation state of the motors. Previous work has shown that K∂340 is predominantly monomeric and that K∂401 is predominantly dimeric (38Lockhart A. Crevel I.M. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These constructs have been used in our EM reconstruction work (39Hirose K. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 40Hirose K. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. Amos L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which allowed direct visual confirmation that K∂340 is monomeric and that K∂401 is dimeric. Fig. 4 shows FPLC analytical gel filtration data for the current truncation/insertion mutants. The K∂340AAGST mutant, which inserts the α-actinin module adjacent to the heads (Fig. 2), is seen to be predominantly monomeric, with a major monomer peak corresponding to the mobility of K∂340GST (not shown) and a secondary peak corresponding to a smaller population of dimers. K∂430GST, with no α-actinin insert, consists predominantly of dimers, with smaller amounts of probably monomers and tetramers. The truncation/insertion mutants K∂376AAGST and K∂401AAGST are dimeric, with a variably sized minor leading shoulder, which may correspond to a small population of tetramers, formed by the antiparallel dimerization of the GST fusion protein. We conclude that the insertion of the α-actinin spacer does not substantially influence the intramolecular dimerization equilibria of the constructs, consistent with our prediction based on the earlier findings of Critchley and co-workers (33Flood G. Kahana E. Gilmore A.P. Rowe A.J. Gratzer W.B. Critchley D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Flood G. Rowe A.J. Critchley D.R. Gratzer W.B. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that the central two α-actinin repeats are not involved in the dimerization of α-actinin chains.Figure 4FPLC gel filtration.

https://openalex.org/W2032530534,"We have cloned eIF4E from the marine mollusk,Aplysia californica. The sequence of eIF4E fromAplysia is more similar to vertebrate eIF4Es than to other invertebrate sequences. Aplysia eIF4E is encoded by two tissue-specific RNAs. Antibodies raised to the carboxyl terminus of eIF4E recognize a 29-kDa protein that can bind to 7-methyl-GTP caps. The phosphorylation site identified in mammalian eIF4E is conserved in the Aplysia homologue, and an Aplysia eIF4E fusion protein is phosphorylated well by both Aplysiaprotein kinase C isoforms. However, protein kinase C phosphorylates both Ser-207 and Thr-208 in vitro, while only Ser-207 is phosphorylated in vivo. We have confirmed that Ser-207 is phosphorylated in vivo by raising a phosphopeptide antibody to this site. This antibody will be useful in determining the signal transduction pathways leading to eIF4E phosphorylation in Aplysia. We have cloned eIF4E from the marine mollusk,Aplysia californica. The sequence of eIF4E fromAplysia is more similar to vertebrate eIF4Es than to other invertebrate sequences. Aplysia eIF4E is encoded by two tissue-specific RNAs. Antibodies raised to the carboxyl terminus of eIF4E recognize a 29-kDa protein that can bind to 7-methyl-GTP caps. The phosphorylation site identified in mammalian eIF4E is conserved in the Aplysia homologue, and an Aplysia eIF4E fusion protein is phosphorylated well by both Aplysiaprotein kinase C isoforms. However, protein kinase C phosphorylates both Ser-207 and Thr-208 in vitro, while only Ser-207 is phosphorylated in vivo. We have confirmed that Ser-207 is phosphorylated in vivo by raising a phosphopeptide antibody to this site. This antibody will be useful in determining the signal transduction pathways leading to eIF4E phosphorylation in Aplysia. eukaryotic initiation factor eukaryotic elongation factor protein kinase C 5′-7-methyl-G(5′)ppp(5′) mitogen-activated protein polymerase chain reaction nitrilotriacetic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis serotonin. Synaptic strength is modulated in the short term by post-translational modifications, such as protein phosphorylation, and in the long term by changes in gene expression. Recently, the regulation of translation has been suggested to be important in regulating synaptic strength at a time between short and long term periods (1Kang H. Schuman E.M. Science. 1996; 273: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 2Sossin W.S. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 215-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 3Steward O.

Brain Res. 1994; 100: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We are therefore interested in the biochemical pathways that regulate translation in the nervous system. Translation is regulated by a number of factors, both eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs)1and eukaryotic elongation factors (eEFs). In the nervous system, a large decrease in translation rate during ischemia in vertebrates is correlated with a Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of eEF2 (5Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Premont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translation rate can be increased by synaptic activation (6Feig S. Lipton P. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by the actions of growth factors (1Kang H. Schuman E.M. Science. 1996; 273: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar); however the translation factors involved in these pathways have not been identified. In other cell types growth factors increase the translation rate through a rapamycin-sensitive pathway involving phosphorylation of two regulators of translation, the S6 kinase and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein (7Brown E.J.

Phosphorylation of the eIF4E-binding protein releases eIF4E, the subunit of the eIF4F initiation complex that binds directly to the 5′-7-methyl-G(5′)ppp(5′)N mRNA cap, from its complex with the eIF4E-binding protein (9Pause A.

In the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, the facilitating neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) induces both short and long term facilitation of the sensory-motorneuron synapse (22Byrne J.H. Kandel E.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 425-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While short term facilitation does not require protein synthesis and long term facilitation requires the activation of transcription, at intermediate times facilitation requires translation, but not transcription (23Ghirardi M. Montarolo P.G. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 413-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when 5-HT is applied only to the synaptic region, long term facilitation requires local protein synthesis at the synapse (24Martin K.C. Casadio A. Zhu H.X., E, Y.P. Rose J.C. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). 5-HT increases the rate of translation in sensory neurons and in the entire pleural ganglia (25Barzilai A. Kennedy T.E. Sweatt J.D. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1577-1586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26Yanow S.K. Manceau F. Hislop J. Castellucci V.F. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 572-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 5-HT-mediated activation of translation in the pleural ganglia can be blocked by rapamycin (26Yanow S.K. Manceau F. Hislop J. Castellucci V.F. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 572-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may involve regulation of eIF4E. To study the regulation of translation at the molecular level in this system, we have cloned and characterized the Aplysia homologue of mammalian eIF4E. The Aplysia eIF4E shares many properties with the vertebrate molecule, including phosphorylation at a conserved serine in vivo. Degenerate PCR primers were designed from eIF4E regions of high conservation and low degeneracy (Fig. 1) and used to synthesize by PCR (template = Aplysia nervous system cDNA plasmid library (27Bartsch D. Ghirardi M. Skehel P.A. Karl K.A. Herder S.P. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R.

Two opposing specific PCR primers were made based on the sequence of this subclone and used in conjunction with primers hybridizing to λGT10 arms to amplify from an Aplysia nervous system λGT10 cDNA library (28Dyer J.R. Johnston W.L. Castellucci V.F. Dunn R.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two overlapping DNA fragments were synthesized, subcloned into BlueScript II plasmid, and sequenced. This eIF4E clone lacked an initiating methionine; therefore, an Aplysia λZAP cDNA library was screened at high stringency with a probe from the 5′ end of the λGT10 eIF4E clone. This screening yielded a clone that includes a possible initiating methionine with a good match to the Kozak consensus sequence. The sequence has been submitted to GenBankTM with accession number AF085810. A six-histidine fusion protein (His-eIF4E) was expressed in bacterial Top10 cells from a pTrcHis plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing an insert of eIF4E amino acids 16 to 215 synthesized using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), primers specific for the ends of the λGT10 eIF4E ORF, and the λGT10 library. The ST-AA mutant was created by PCR using the same 5′ primer, a different 3′ primer (GGGGTACCTTATACTGTAAAGCGGTTTTTCACAGCTGCTCCAGCCTTGCCTGC), and the pTrcHis-eIF4E plasmid. The His-eIF4E fusion proteins were purified on nickel-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen, Missisauga, ON). RNA was isolated from Aplysiatissue using Trizol. Five μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane (equivalent amounts verified by methylene blue staining of the nylon filters). The RNA was transferred to Hybond-N nylon filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Oakville, ON), UV-cross-linked, and hybridized overnight at 42 °C with an end-labeled antisense oligonucleotide probe (CATCTTCCTCCCTTCTTATTCTGTGCGTCCTCCCACATAGG-CTGGATGCCGGCCTTAAACACGCT) corresponding to amino acids 77–99 (Fig. 1) in 6× SSC, 0.5% sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml tRNA. The blots were washed twice for 15 min at 55 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed for 6 days at −80 °C. The 15 carboxyl-terminal amino acids (Fig. 1) plus an amino-terminal cysteine and the same peptide with Ser-207 converted to phosphoserine were synthesized, conjugated to bovine serum albumin maleimide (Pierce) via the cysteine, and injected intramuscularly into rabbits along with TitreMax Gold (CytRx, Norcross, GA) three times at 3-week intervals. Serum from the animals was passed over a SulfoLink affinity column (Pierce) of the immunizing peptide, and specifically retained antibodies were eluted and concentrated in a Centriplus-10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Western blots were performed as described (29Dyer J.R. Sossin W.S. Klein M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 932-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with the nonphosphorylated peptide antibody at 2 μg/ml dilution or the phosphorylated peptide antibody at 1 μg/ml dilution, and goat anti-rabbit, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1 μg/ml. For immunoblots with the phosphopeptide antibody, nonphosphorylated peptide at 1 μg/μl was incubated with the primary antibody for 30 min prior to its addition to the blot. Results were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). A. californica (100–250 g) were obtained from Marine Specimins Unlimited (Pacific Palisades, CA) and maintained in an aquarium for at least 3 days before experimentation. The nervous system from an Aplysia was homogenized on ice in homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) and 100 mm KCl for 60 min at 15 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed twice with 500 μl of 100 μm GDP before elution of the bound eIF4E by a 5-min incubation with 500 μl of 100 μm 7-methyl-GTP. Equivalent proportions of each fraction were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with the eIF4E antibody as described above. The His-eIF4E fusion protein was tested as a substrate for phosphorylation by purified AplI and AplII, the two Aplysia PKC isoforms (29Dyer J.R. Sossin W.S. Klein M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 932-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Sossin W.S. Fan X.T. Saberi F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 40 nm to 3 μm His-eIF4E was incubated with either 1.5 nm AplI or 0.5 nm AplII in the presence of 20 nm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 50 μm ATP, including 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer, separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membranes were exposed to film and/or a PhosphorImager screen and quantitated using ImageQuant (Molecular Probes). The carboxyl-terminal peptide (30 μm to 1 mm) was also tested as a substrate for AplI and AplII. The phosphorylation reactions were stopped by spotting them on phosphocellulose P81 filters and soaking the filters in 3 mm ATP. The filters were washed for 5 min in 100 mm phosphoric acid four times, and the bound radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. For tryptic mapping of the peptides, the bovine serum albumin-peptide conjugates were phosphorylated under similar conditions, separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and excised for tryptic digestion. Three adult Aplysianervous systems were incubated in resting medium (26Yanow S.K. Manceau F. Hislop J. Castellucci V.F. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 572-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) containing [32P]orthophosphate at 2 mCi/ml for 20 h at 15 °C, washed in resting medium three times, homogenized on ice in homogenizing microtubes in 500 μl of homogenization buffer (see above) supplemented with 50 mm NaF and 1 μmmicrocystin, and centrifuged at 2500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. 360 μl of the supernatant was added to 40 μl of 1m KCl and 150 μl of 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose 4B beads and then handled as described in the cap binding section above, except that the beads were rinsed twice in 500 μl of homogenization buffer plus 100 mm KCl before the GDP washes, and the beads were eluted with 200 μl of 7-methyl-GTP, all of which was loaded onto the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was exposed to Kodak BioMax MS film for 2 days at −80 °C with enhancing screens. Phosphopeptide analysis was performed as described with several modifications (31Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Membrane fragments containing protein bands were preblocked in 0.5% PVP-360 in 100 mm acetic acid, washed, and subsequently digested overnight with 10 μg of trypsin in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 5% acetonitrile. An additional 10 μg of trypsin was added to each band for 3 h the following day and the supernatant solution containing desired peptides was lyophilized to completion. Peptides were resuspended in pH 1.9 buffer (0.6 m formic and 1.4 m acetic acid) and analyzed by two-dimensional TLC using a Hunter-3000 HTLC. Labeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax MS film on the plate. After tryptic digestion and lyophilization, eIF4E peptides derived from in vitro orin vivo phosphorylations were hydrolyzed to constituent amino acids using constant boiling 6 n HCl for 2.5 h at 110 °C. Sample amino acids were mixed with phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards prior to running the mixture in the primary TLC dimension using standard buffers (31Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid standards were stained with 0.25% ninhydrin in acetone, and autoradiography was performed on the completed plate. We used a degenerate PCR strategy to clone a fragment of eIF4E from anAplysia nervous system cDNA library and then used PCR and library screening to extend this clone (see “Experimental Procedures”). Eventually a 2000-base pair DNA fragment was cloned containing an ORF of 215 amino acids 30–59% identical to eIF4E from other species (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the clone is more homologous to the vertebrate sequence (59%) than to other invertebrate sequences. The ORF begins at a putative initiating methionine which has a good match to the Kozak consensus and whose position is similar to that in vertebrate eIF4Es. An in-frame stop codon at the carboxyl-terminal is present at a position analogous to that of other eIF4E proteins. Residues necessary for eIF4E binding to the 5′ cap of mRNA (32Morino S. Hazama H.

Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) are completely conserved, as is the phosphorylation consensus sequence near the carboxyl-terminal. The distribution of the eIF4E message in three Aplysia tissues was investigated by Northern blot. A 3000-nucleotide message was detected in the gill, while a 6000-base pair message was seen in the nervous system and ovotestis (Fig. 2 A). The different relative amounts of the two transcripts in different tissues indicates that the transcripts are regulated in a tissue-specific manner. The large size of the message suggests that there are considerable uncharacterized 5′- and/or 3′-untranslated sequences on the messages. We raised an antibody to a synthetic peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal of Aplysia eIF4E. This antibody recognized a major 29-kDa protein in all the tissues examined (Fig. 2 B), including gill where the eIF4E message was smaller. The 29-kDa protein is specifically eluted from 7-methyl-GTP beads, whereas other cross-reacting bands are not (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating that this immunoreactive 29-kDa protein has the properties expected of eIF4E. Although 29 kDa is larger than the predicted molecular size of eIF4E (24.6 kDa), it is very similar to the apparent molecular size of vertebrate eIF4E run on SDS-PAGE which also has a similar predicted molecular size(15, 35). We determined whether eIF4E is phosphorylated in vivo by examining the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into Aplysia eIF4E in intact ganglia. Two proteins which specifically eluted from 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose beads were labeled (Fig. 2 D), one at 29 kDa that aligns exactly to the location of Aplysia eIF4E as seen on the corresponding Western blot (Fig. 2 D, lane 3), and the other at 22 kDa, which is more heavily phosphorylated. The 22-kDa protein is likely to be an eIF4E-binding protein, but we cannot rule out a protein that binds independently to caps, such as the cap-binding protein involved in cap-dependent mRNA transport (36Izaurralde E. Lewis J. Gamberi C. Jarmolowski A. McGuigan C. Mattaj I.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 37Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C. Jankowska M. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In mammals, eIF4E is phosphorylated by PKC in vitro at Ser-209, which is also the in vivophosphorylation site (12Flynn A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21684-21688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Joshi B. Cai A.L. Keiper B.D. Minich W.B. Mendez R. Beach C.M. Stepinski J. Stolarski R.

Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11831-11837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This site is conserved in Aplysia (Ser-207) (Fig. 1). To assess AplysiaeIF4E as a substrate for phosphorylation by PKC, we expressedAplysia eIF4E in bacteria as a fusion protein with an amino-terminal six-histidine tag. This recombinant protein (His-eIF4E) was readily phosphorylated in vitro by bothAplysia PKC isoforms, AplI and AplII (data not shown). Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the data yieldedK m values of 215 ± 22 nm, S.E.,n = 4 (AplI) and 123 ± 18 nm, S.E., n = 4 (AplII). Maximal phosphorylation of eIF4E incorporated 0.4 mol of phosphate/mol of eIF4E, similar to results from vertebrates (14Whalen S.G. Gingras A.C. Amankwa L. Mader S. Branton P.E. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11831-11837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether the carboxyl-terminal PKC consensus sequence in Aplysia eIF4E can be phosphorylated, an in vitrophosphorylation reaction was performed using the carboxyl-terminal peptide (Fig. 1) containing the consensus sequence. Surprisingly, although these peptides were phosphorylated, the K mvalues were several orders of magnitude higher than that of the fusion protein, K m = 503 ± 133 μm, S.E., n = 3 (AplI) and K m= 512 ± 167 μm, S.E., n = 3 (AplII), suggesting that the peptides themselves are poor substrates for PKC. Despite the high K m value for the peptides, PKC phosphorylation of His-eIF4E was due to phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal sites. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analysis of PKC-phosphorylated eIF4E revealed two spots (Fig. 3 A), and these same two spots are observed in the PKC-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal peptide (Fig. 3, B and C). This suggests that the sites where PKC phosphorylates eIF4E are included in the carboxyl-terminal peptide. The difference in the K m values for phosphorylation is consistent with the idea that the three-dimensional folding of the protein is important for phosphorylation (14Whalen S.G. Gingras A.C.

Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Rhoads R.E. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10617-10621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the two spots seen in the two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis may be due to PKC phosphorylation at Thr-208, as well as Ser-207, as has been reported for vertebrate eIF4E (13Joshi B. Cai A.L. Keiper B.D. Minich W.B. Mendez R. Beach C.M. Stepinski J. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14597-14603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Indeed, phosphoamino acid analysis of the tryptic peptides generated after phosphorylation of His-eIF4E showed phosphorylation at both serine and threonine (data not shown). To confirm this, we synthesized the carboxyl-terminal peptide with serine converted to phosphoserine. Consistent with the hypothesis that PKC phosphorylates Thr-208 in vitro, this peptide was also a substrate for PKC. Two-dimensional tryptic analysis of this product revealed only the slower migrating spot demonstrating that this spot corresponded to the doubly phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 3, D and E). This is consistent with its predicted charge of −1 compared with the predicted charge of 0 for the singly phosphorylated peptide. Only one spot that co-migrated with the singly phosphorylated peptide was seen after in vivo phosphorylation of eIF4E (Fig. 3, Fand G). The in vivo labeled eIF4E contained only serine by phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 3 H). These results are consistent with phosphorylation of Ser-207 in vivo. To confirm the site of phosphorylation, we generated an antibody to the carboxyl-terminal peptide phosphorylated at Ser-207. This antibody did not recognize the His-eIF4E fusion protein, but did recognize this fusion protein after phosphorylation by PKC in vitro (Fig. 4 A). After mutating Ser-207 and Thr-208 of His-eIF4E to alanines, the antibody was unable to recognize the mutated eIF4E treated with PKC, and phosphorylation of the mutant His-eIF4E by PKC was greatly reduced (Fig. 4 B). The eIF4E antibody that was generated to the nonphosphorylated carboxyl-terminal peptide was not sensitive to this mutation, suggesting that this antibody is not sensitive to the phosphorylation state of eIF4E (Fig. 4 B). The anti-phosphopeptide antibody recognized eIF4E from Aplysiaganglia demonstrating that Ser-207 is phosphorylated in vivoat a basal level (Fig. 4 C). In this experiment, different levels of nonphosphorylated His-eIF4E were also included on the gel to ensure that the phosphopeptide antibody signal did not contain immunoreactivity to nonphosphorylated eIF4E. At the exposure times used, there was no cross-reactivity to the His-eIF4E, even though the levels were substantially above the level of eIF4E in the ganglia (Fig. 4 C). eIF4E is the least abundant component of the translation initiation complex. Consequently, its activity and availability regulate the complex's function and, in turn, the rate of translation in eukaryotes (10Sonenberg N. Herschey J. Matthews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar). We have cloned eIF4E from Aplysia to study its potential role in changing the translation rate during learning and memory formation in this organism. We demonstrate here that Aplysia eIF4E is a true eIF4E homologue based on its high homology to eIF4E in other species and its ability to bind specifically to a mRNA cap analogue. In addition,Aplysia eIF4E is phosphorylated in vivo at the serine homologous to the serine phosphorylated in vertebrate cell lines. The amino acid sequence of Aplysia eIF4E is closer to that of vertebrate eIF4E isoforms (almost 60% identical) than to other invertebrate isoforms (30–40% identical), suggesting that the function and regulation of Aplysia eIF4E will be similar to that of eIF4E in vertebrates. The closer relationship to vertebrate isoforms is primarily due to a higher degree of identity in the carboxyl-terminal region, including the consensus phosphorylation site (Fig. 1). This is somewhat surprising, as mollusks are at least as distant from vertebrates as are insects, and for many otherAplysia sequences that are present in both vertebrates and insects, the Aplysia sequence is more similar toDrosophila homologues than to vertebrate ones (data not shown). This suggests that regulation of translation in Aplysia may be more similar to vertebrates than to these other invertebrates. There are two transcripts of eIF4E in Aplysia detected on Northern blots. There are mRNAs for multiple eIF4E isoforms in humans (38Gao M. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4622-4628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), Drosophila (39Lavoie C.A. Lachance P. Sonenberg N. Lasko P. J. Biol.

The alternatively spliced Drosophila isoforms differ only slightly at their amino termini, and the Xenopus isoforms differ only in containing one or two copies of a short insert. However, the two types of eIF4E in wheat germ arise from different genes, have quite different amino acid sequences (50% identity), and exist in different initiation complexes. In Aplysia, the twoAplysia eIF4E mRNAs differ greatly in size and tissue distribution, although it is unlikely that the proteins encoded by the mRNAs differ proportionately in size, because our antibody recognizes proteins which migrate identically on SDS-PAGE from tissues expressing either the larger or the smaller mRNA. Rather, there are probably additional domains in the untranslated regions of the longer mRNA, making it tempting to speculate that the messages are translated in response to different cellular factors, such as is the case for insulin-like growth factor II (44Nielsen F.C. Ostergaard L. Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Nature. 1995; 377: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The initiation of translation is regulated by the availability and phosphorylation of eIF4E, which enhances mRNA cap binding (15Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and stabilizes the interaction between eIF4E and eIF-4G (16Bu X. Haas D.W. Hagedorn C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4975-4978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, eIF4E is phosphorylated at Ser-209 in vivo (12Flynn A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21684-21688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Joshi B. Cai A.L. Keiper B.D. Minich W.B. Mendez R. Beach C.M. Stepinski J. Stolarski R.

This serine is conserved in Aplysia (Ser-207), and Aplysia eIF4E in vitro is a good substrate for the Aplysia PKC isoforms. However, while PKC phosphorylates both Ser-207 and Thr-208 in vitro, eIF4E is phosphorylatedin vivo only at Ser-207. Furthermore, activation of PKC in the Aplysia nervous system decreases translation (26Yanow S.K. Manceau F. Hislop J. Castellucci V.F. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 572-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), while an increase in eIF4E phosphorylation would be predicted to increase the translation rate. Recently, activation of the MAP kinase-activated Mnk has been proposed to be associated with phosphorylation of eIF4E (20Wang X. Flynn A. Waskiewicz A.J. Webb B. Vries R.G. Baines I.A. Cooper J.A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9373-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and Mnk phosphorylates eIF4E in vitro at Ser-209 (21Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the MAP kinase pathway is also involved in regulating long term facilitation in Aplysia (45Martin K.C. Michael D. Rose J.C. Barad M. Casadio A. Zhu H. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 899-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and may be involved in regulating translation. The eIF4E phosphopeptide antibody will be useful for dissecting out the pathway controlling eIF4E phosphorylation in Aplysia. If the antibody is also useful in immunocytochemistry, it should be possible to localize the activation of eIF4E and determine whether the local protein synthesis required for synapse-specific long term facilitation (24Martin K.C.

https://openalex.org/W2035742371,"A cDNA for human microfibril-associated glycoprotein-2 (MAGP-2) was used to screen a human leukocyte genomic DNA library in EMBL-3 vector. One clone, clone H (10 kilobase pairs (kbp)), was isolated that contained most of the MAGP-2 gene. The remainder of the 3′ end of the gene was obtained by direct polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA. The human MAGP-2 gene was found to be about 11 kbp in size and to contain 10 evenly distributed exons. The internal exons range in size from 30 base pairs (bp) to 88 bp with exons 4 and 6 the only exons of equal size (45 bp). All internal intron:exon junctions are defined by canonical splice donor and acceptor sites. Each junction has a 1/2 codon split with the exception of the exon 8/9 junction, which has a 2/1 split. The translation initiation codon is in exon 2, and the final exon contains 110 bp of coding sequence, including 2 cysteine codons. Primer extension experiments identified only one major transcription initiation site, 213 bases upstream of the ATG site. Rapid analysis of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the 5′ end of MAGP-2 mRNA from placenta confirmed this result and did not detect any alternative splicing of transcripts. The putative promoter region of the MAGP-2 gene was found to be AT-rich and it lacked a TATA box and other common regulatory elements. However the sequence surrounding the transcription start site CTCA(+1)TTCC was similar to the consensus CTCA(+1)NTCT (N is any nucleoside) for an initiator element found in terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and a number of other highly regulated genes. Comparison with the previously characterized human MAGP-1 gene showed that structural similarity was largely confined to the exact size, sequence, and junction alignment of the two penultimate exons which encode the first six of the seven cysteine residues that are precisely spaced in both proteins. The findings are consistent with the growing evidence that, although MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 are both intimately involved in the biology of fibrillin-containing microfibrils, the MAGPs are structurally, functionally, and developmentally diverse proteins which share one characteristic cysteine-rich motif.

MAGP-21 is a 25-kDa glycoprotein that recently has been identified in specific association with fibrillin-containing microfibrils in the extracellular matrix of a number of tissues (1Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G.

In elastic tissues such as artery, lung, and skin, these microfibrils are components of elastic fibers in association with the elastic protein, elastin. In other tissues such as ocular zonule, kidney glomerulus, and muscle, the microfibrils occur as elastin-free bundles (3Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1983; 10: 97-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite being the subjects of intensive investigation, the precise molecular composition, architecture, and structural and functional heterogeneity of the microfibrils are still being elucidated (4Cleary E.G.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 747-760Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The major structural components of the microfibrils are rod-like, 350-kDa glycoproteins named fibrillin 1 and 2 that appear to be arranged as parallel bundles of 4–8 molecules joined in series in a head to tail manner (6Sakai L.Y.

Fibrillins 1 and 2 have distinct but overlapping spaciotemporal tissue distributions, and it is unclear if they form separate populations of microfibrils or if they can coexist in the same microfibril (9Zhang H.

It has been suggested that fibrillin 1 has a persistent structural role, whereas fibrillin 2 is predominantly involved in the early stages of elastic fiber assembly (10Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W.

Mutations in the genes for fibrillin 1 and fibrillin 2 have been, respectively, linked to the heritable connective tissue disorders, Marfan syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly (12Dietz H.C.

However, in the case of MAGP-1 there is strong biochemical and immunoelectron microscopic evidence that, in tissues, this 31-kDa glycoprotein is covalently linked by disulfide bonding in a specific periodic manner to most if not all fibrillin-1-containing microfibrils (23Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S.

This suggests that MAGP-1 may be an integral component of microfibrils of this type. Its structural relative, MAGP-2, is also disulfide-bonded to fibrillin-containing microfibrils, but it exhibits more restricted tissue and developmental patterns of distribution, suggesting that MAGP-2 has a more specialized role in microfibril biology (1Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G.

Cloning of MAGPs 1 and 2 revealed that they each contain a central region of close sequence similarity between the molecules, including precise alignment of seven cysteine residues (1Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G.

It is considered likely that this cysteine-rich region is involved in the interactions of MAGPs with other components of the microfibril. In contrast, the other regions of MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 were found to be very divergent in structure, and the N-terminal regions of the molecules have also been shown to have distinct molecular binding properties (28Brown-Augsburger P.

In the current study, we have characterized the exon structure of the human MAGP-2 gene and compared it to that of the human MAGP-1 gene described previously (27Faraco J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Francke U. Genomics. 1995; 25: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Overall the genes for MAGPs 1 and 2 were found not to be closely related in structure. A 318-bp digoxigenin-labeled fragment of human MAGP-2 cDNA was prepared from cDNA clone H61 (1Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Kumaratilake J.S. Sandberg L.B. Nichol J.K. Sutherland G.R. Cleary E.G. J.

The primers used were F1, 5′-CCTGGGGGTCAATAGTCAAC-3′, and R2, 5′-CACAGGGAGGAAGTCGGAAGTAAT-3′, corresponding to bases 282–301 and 677–700, respectively, of the final cDNA sequence. The reaction mixture (40 μl) contained MgCl2 (2 mm); dATP, dCTP, and dGTP (200 μm each); dTTP (130 μm); digoxigenin-dUTP (70 μm), primers (0.1 μm each), and Taq DNA polymerase (0.5 units). The PCR was conducted on a capillary thermal cycler, model FTS-1 (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia) for 40 cycles of 95, 55, and 72 °C, as per the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA probe was gel-purified and used to screen a human leukocyte genomic library in EMBL-3 λ vector (CLONTECH) plated at a density of 2 × 104 plaque-forming units/plate. Hybridization to nylon membrane plaque lifts was conducted at 37 °C as described previously (18Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Davis E.C. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Mecham R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6932-6942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the final wash was conducted at 42 °C. Positive plaques were identified with anti-digoxigenin antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase as described previously (26Gibson M.A. Sandberg L.B. Grosso L.E. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7596-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic DNA inserts were amplified using EMBL-3-specific primers and the Expand Long Template PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Clones were authenticated by successful PCR reamplification of insert fragments with a range of primer pairs consisting of one MAGP-2 cDNA-specific primer and one EMBL-3 primer. Direct sequencing (fmol kit, Promega) of these products was used to confirm the presence of exons from the MAGP-2 gene. Further sequencing of both DNA strands with appropriate primers was used to elucidate the sequences surrounding intron:exon junctions. The 3′ region of the MAGP-2 gene was directly amplified and sequenced from human genomic DNA by PCR using a forward primer Gen F3, 5′-GGCCGGTTAAACAATGCATTCATCAG-3′ (bases 509–534), and reverse primer R10, 5′-AAGCTGGACATTGCAAAAGGATT-3′ (bases 841–863) from the 3′-untranslated region of the MAGP-2 cDNA. Total RNA was prepared from human term placentas using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. A reverse primer, PERA, 5′-TCCGCTGAAACAATGAGATGAGG-3′, corresponding to bases 55–77 of the MAGP-2 cDNA, was synthesized and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi/pmol of primer). Labeled primer (5 pmol) was then annealed in water with 3-μg samples of total placental RNA, or tRNA as a control, by heating to 70 °C for 10 min followed by cooling in ice. The samples (20 μl) were then incubated at 50 °C for 50 min with 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, containing 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 400 μm dNTPs. The reaction was terminated by incubation at 70 °C for 15 min, and the RNA was digested by treatment with RNase A (10 μg) for 20 min at 37 °C. The primer extension products were ethanol-precipitated and analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel. To identify the transcription start site, labeled primer PERA was also used to prime (from MAGP-2 genomic DNA) a standard sequencing ladder that was electrophoresed concurrently on the gel. To confirm the position of the transcription start site and to search for possible alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA, RACE-PCR was used to obtain a range of cDNA clones corresponding to the 5′ region of MAGP-2 mRNA from human placental RNA. The 5′ RACE system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used following the manufacturers instructions. Briefly, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (1 μg) using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (200 units) and 100 nmol of reverse primer, R7, 5′-AGTCGCTTGAGTCACATCGTCT-3′ corresponding to bases 306–327 of MAGP-2 cDNA. The first-strand cDNA was purified using a GlassMax spin cartridge and oligo(dC)-tailed using terminal transferase. Nested PCR was used to amplify the cDNA through two rounds of 40 cycles of 95, 50, and 72 °C. For the first round of amplification, a MAGP-2 cDNA-specific reverse primer, R17, 5′-CCCAGGGGTATCCAGTCAGAGGT-3′ (bases 265–287, spanning the exon 2/3 junction), and an inosine-containing oligo(dC) binding anchor primer 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′ were used. For direct sequencing, the second round of PCR utilized primer R17 and abridged anchor primer 5′- GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′. Exon 2-specific reverse primer R11, 5′-TGCAGCAAGAAACAGCAGCACC-3′ (bases 234–255) was used to prime the sequencing reaction. For cloning, the abridged anchor primer and reverse primer R16 SalI, 5′-GACATATTGTCGACGGTGTTCTGCTCTT-3′ (bases 191–218, modified to include the SalI restriction site, underlined) were used for the second round of PCR. The PCR product was digested with SalI and cloned into pBluescript (KS+) vector. A range of individual clones were purified and sequenced as described previously (26Gibson M.A. Sandberg L.B. Grosso L.E. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7596-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Screening of the EMBL-3 human genomic DNA library with a human MAGP-2 cDNA probe led to the identification and purification of a 10-kbp clone, clone H, which yielded PCR products when amplified using several MAGP-2 cDNA-specific oligonucleotide primers. The authenticity of clone H was confirmed when sequencing of the PCR products revealed the presence of MAGP-2 cDNA sequences. Further sequencing revealed that clone H contained all but the extreme 3′ end of the MAGP-2 gene. This region was directly amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using a reverse primer from the 3′-untranslated region of MAGP-2 cDNA. The human MAGP-2 gene was found to be about 11 kbp in size and to contain 10 exons, which are evenly distributed (Fig. 1). Sequencing showed that all internal intron:exon junctions are defined by canonical splice donor and acceptor sites (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the human MAGP-2 cDNA sequence with the exon boundaries marked. Each junction has a 1/2 codon split with the exception of the exon 8/9 junction, which is split 2/1. The internal exons range in size from 30 to 88 bp, with exons 4 and 6 the only exons of equal size (45 bp each). The translation initiation codon is located in exon 2, and the final exon contains 110 bp of coding sequence including two cysteine codons. The 3′ end of exon 10 remains to be defined.Figure 2Sequences of intron:exon junctions. The 5′ and 3′ ends of each exon are shown in uppercase.

The two penultimate exons, 8 and 9, of the MAGP-2 gene match in size with the corresponding exons, 7 and 8, respectively, of the MAGP-1 gene, which contains one less coding exon (27Faraco J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Francke U. Genomics. 1995; 25: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However the splicing patterns for the rest of the two genes have no discernible similarities, indicating that the genes are quite divergent in structure. Further analysis showed precise sequence and junction alignment of exons 8 and 9 of the MAGP-2 gene with exons 7 and 8 of the MAGP-1 gene (Fig. 4). These exons encode most of the region of amino acid sequence homology previously identified between MAGP-1 and MAGP-2, where the spacing of seven cysteine residues is precisely conserved between the two proteins (96). The first group of four aligned cysteines are encoded by MAGP-2 exon 8 and MAGP-1 exon 7, which also encodes an additional cysteine. The next two cysteines are aligned in MAGP-2 exon 9 and MAGP-1 exon 8. The remaining region of homology containing the seventh aligned cysteine is encoded in both genes at the extreme 5′ end of the final exon. In the exon 8/exon 7 alignment, sequence similarity is present throughout the exon, whereas in the exon 9/exon 8 comparison there is strong similarity in the 5′ region but little homology in the 3′ region.Table IComparison of the number and size of coding exons in the human MAGP-2 and MAGP-1 genesMAGP-1MAGP-2ExonSizeExonSizebpbp278260390336427445587533645645730788888874974910110110codingcodingBoldface numbers correspond to exons with size and sequence similarities between the genes.

Francke U. Genomics. 1995; 25: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To identify the translation start site and thus to define the 5′ end of exon 1, a primer extension experiment was conducted using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and total RNA from human placenta (Fig. 5). A major band was identified in extensions from two different placental RNA samples (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3), which was absent from the tRNA control lane (Fig. 5, lane 1). The size of this extension product was determined to be 77 bp by comparison to the sequence ladder obtained from genomic clone H using the same primer. It should be noted that the band corresponds to the base that is one space higher on the sequencing ladder due to the mechanism of sequencing that terminates each chain by the addition of a dideoxynucleotide. This corresponds to a point 213 bases upstream of the ATG translation initiation site in the MAGP-2 cDNA. Three additional bands migrating slightly more slowly than the major band were also identified. However these bands were also present in the tRNA control lane (lane 1), indicating that they represent nonspecific artifacts in the analysis. Thus only one major transcription start site was evident for the MAGP-2 gene in placental tissue. The above findings were consistent with the results of the RACE-PCR of MAGP-2 mRNA from placenta (not shown). Direct sequencing of the RACE-PCR product showed clear sequence from exons 1 and 2, which could be read to within 8 bases of the transcription start site identified above. There was no evidence of shadow sequences, which would indicate alternative exon usage. Analysis of more than 20 individual clones prepared from the RACE-PCR product showed that the 5′ end of each was downstream of the identified start site and that most clones terminated at various points within 25 bases of the site. Sequences that diverged from exon 1 sequences were not detected. The results confirm that exon 1 is the first exon of the MAGP-2 gene. The finalized sequence of exon 1 and 976 bases of upstream sequence are shown in Fig. 6. This 5′-flanking region containing the putative promoter of the MAGP-2 gene was found to be A + T-rich (59%), and it lacked a typical TATA box. However the sequence around A+1 of the transcription initiation site showed strong similarity to pyrimidine-rich initiator elements, which encompass the transcription start site of a number of developmentally regulated genes with TATA-less promoters. In particular, the MAGP-2 gene sequence −3CTCATTCC+5 is similar to the extensively characterized initiator consensus sequence−3CTCANTCT+5 found in the highly regulated gene, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and several other TATA-less genes (31Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 32Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev.

The putative promoter and exon 1 were scanned for the presence of potential regulatory elements. No full consensus sequences for common transcription regulatory elements such as Sp1, OCT, or CAAT sites were identified in the region proximal to the initiator sequence using the program TESS (Transcription Element Search Software) 2http://agave.humgen.upenn.edu/tess/index.html. and the Transfac v3.2 data base (34Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 364-370Crossref Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). However, the complementary sequence immediately upstream of the initiator site,−12GGGAATTTGC-21, has similarity to the consensus, GGGANTTYCC, for binding of regulatory factor NF-κB (35Zabel U. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 252-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study has characterized the human MAGP-2 gene, which we have previously located on chromosome 12 at 12p12.3–13.1 (1Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Kumaratilake J.S. Sandberg L.B. Nichol J.K. Sutherland G.R. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1096-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and compared its structure to that of the MAGP-1 gene (27Faraco J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Francke U. Genomics. 1995; 25: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The two genes were found to be diverse in structure. The MAGP-2 gene was shown to consist of 10 exons, 9 of which contain coding sequence for a total of 173 amino acids (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). In contrast, the human MAGP-1 gene utilizes 8 coding exons for 183 amino acids (27Faraco J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Francke U. Genomics. 1995; 25: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating that its average exon size is larger (Table I). Structural conservation between the genes was confined to the precise size and splice junction alignment of two penultimate exons, 8 and 9 in the MAGP-2 gene and 7 and 8 in the MAGP-1 gene (Fig. 4 A). These two exons encode the first 6 of the 7 precisely aligned cysteine residues in the center of both proteins (Fig. 4 B). This region of each protein is probably responsible for a function(s) common to both proteins, including linkage to other components of the fibrillin-containing microfibrils. Neither MAGP-1 nor MAGP-2 has yet been shown to bind to fibrillins, but differential molecular interactions with other molecules have been found involving the structurally divergent N-terminal domains. This region of MAGP-1 binds tropoelastin and collagen VI in vitro, and it is possible that the glycoprotein functions on the surface of the microfibrils as an elastin-binding protein during elastinogenesis and as an anchoring protein mediating the interaction of fibrillin-containing microfibrils and collagen VI microfibrils (28Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Mecham L. Mercer R. Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28443-28449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. Biochem.

In contrast, MAGP-2 lacks these binding characteristics, but its N-terminal region contains an RGD motif that interacts in vitro with cell surfaces via the αVβ3 integrin, 3M. A. Gibson, manuscript in preparation. suggesting that MAGP-2 may play a role in microfibril-cell interactions. Thus the divergent nature of their exon structures is consistent with the distinct binding functions of the two proteins. Although both MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 are specifically associated with fibrillin-containing microfibrils, MAGP-2 has more restricted patterns of tissue expression, being absent from the microfibrils of the ocular zonule and the elastic fibers of the aortic media and having restricted distribution in tissues such as kidney and skin (2Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). During development of the highly elastic tissue, bovine nuchal ligament, MAGP-2 expression was found to peak during the early stages of elastinogenesis, whereas MAGP-1 was expressed at consistently high levels throughout middle and late fetal development (2Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus it is evident that the MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 genes are differentially regulated, and this is supported by comparison of the structures of their putative promoter regions. The RACE-PCR experiments detected no alternative splicing of the human MAGP-2 gene in placental tissue, suggesting that the gene contains only one promoter region (not shown). In addition, primer extension experiments detected the presence of only one major transcription initiation site (Fig. 5). Upstream from this site, the putative promoter region is AT-rich and lacks TATA, CAAT, and other common regulatory elements (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the sequence spanning the transcription start site has close similarity to the consensus for initiator elements found in terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and a number of other highly regulated TATA-less genes (32Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar, 33Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Such sequences are able to initiate accurate basal transcription without the presence of other upstream regulatory elements (31Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Like the MAGP-2 gene, the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene lacks common regulatory elements, is not GC-rich, and has one transcription start site. Non-GC-rich, TATA-less promoters are usually highly regulated during development and differentiation and initiate transcription at only one or a few tightly clustered start sites (31Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Thus the promoter region of the MAGP-2 gene appears to have characteristics that are consistent with its restricted patterns of expression. It is interesting that several additional examples of the pyrimidine-rich initiator consensus were identified in exon 1, and it is unclear why these are not utilized for transcription. It is possible that the NF-κB-like element immediately upstream of the transcription start site is important for its selection and regulation of MAGP-2 gene transcription (Fig. 6). NF-κB/Rel transcription factors (36Grilli M. Chui J.J.-S. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar) have been shown to interact with the initiator protein, TFII-I, and to bind to sequences close to initiator elements in several genes (37Montano M.A. Kripke K. Norina C.D. Achacoso P. Herzenberg L.A. Roy A.L. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12376-12381Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast to the MAGP-2 gene, the human MAGP-1 gene appears to exhibit alternative exon usage at the extreme 5′ end of the mRNA (27Faraco J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Francke U. Genomics. 1995; 25: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that its transcription could be initiated from at least two distinct sites and raising the possibility that the gene may be under the control of two distinct promoter regions. The sequences flanking the alternatively used primary exons also lack TATA and CAAT sequences but are relatively GC-rich rather than AT-rich (27Faraco J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Francke U. Genomics. 1995; 25: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus the MAGP-1 gene appears to be regulated by a promoter that can be categorized with a different group of TATA-less promoters. Genes of this GC-rich group often have several transcription initiation sites and are usually widely expressed (31Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 32Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it is apparent that the two human MAGP genes contain different classes of promoters that reflect their patterns of tissue and developmental expression. The distinct structures of the two MAGP genes are consistent with the concept that MAGP-1 and MAGP-2, although they share one characteristic cysteine-rich motif, are structurally and functionally diverse proteins involved in the biology of fibrillin-containing microfibrils."

By coexpression of human prepro-LPH with furin in COS-7 cells we show that furin generates a mature-like LPH. Radioactive amino acid sequence analysis reveals that furin recognizes the motif R-T-P-R832, a protein convertase consensus, to generate a NH2 terminus located 36 amino acids upstream of the NH2 terminal found in vivo at Ala869. This intermediate is ultimately cleaved to the mature LPH form by other proteases including the pancreatic ones.

This precursor is glycosylated and subjected to proteolytic processing events on its way from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the brush-border membrane. Mature LPH consists of somewhat more than the COOH-terminal half portion of prepro-LPH, i.e. two of the four homologous regions (regions III and IV) plus the transmembrane and the cytosolic segments. The first protease acting on prepro-LPH is signal peptidase in the ER, which was predicted (1Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G.

Note that we indicate as mature-like LPHs those lactase forms that have a molecular size similar to, but have not been demonstrated to have an amino acid sequence identical to that of mature brush-border LPH. Endoproteolytic cleavages at sites comprising the sequence motifs -R-R- or K/R-X-X-R- participate in the post-translational processing of many proteins. The subtilisin-related proprotein convertases (PCs) are a family of calcium-dependent serine endoproteases. These enzymes share between 50 and 74% amino acid sequence identity in the subtilisin-like catalytic domain (for reviews on their substrate consensus motifs, see, e.g., Refs. 11Steiner D.F.

Recent reports have suggested that processing of human pro-LPH to mature LPH in the intestine occurs in more than one step (4Wüthrich M. Grünberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I. Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Jacob R. Radebach I. Wüthrich M. Grünberg J. Sterchi E.E. Naim H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism, however, is not known. Because the pro region of human LPH contains several potential cleavage sites for subtilisin-like proteases (one site occurs upstream of, but not immediately preceding the NH2 terminus of mature, brush-border LPH), we examined their potential to process human pro-LPH. We have now identified furin as a likely candidate involved in the first step of the maturation of human pro-LPH. Furin or furin-like PC(s) can generate a mature-like LPH that is 36 amino acids longer than mature LPH. Further proteolytic processing of this mature-like LPH form of human lactase to generate the final mature LPH form includes the eventual, albeit limited, action of pancreatic proteases (e.g. trypsin). All chemicals were of the highest possible purity and were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) unless otherwise indicated. pSCTmLPH (human prepro-LPH (25Oberholzer T. Mantei N. Semenza G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) was prepared in our laboratory. The cDNA coding for mouse furin, pSCTmfurin (26Hatsuzawa K. Hosaka M. Nakagawa T. Nagase M. Shoda A. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. K. Nakayama, University of Tsukuba, Japan, and subcloned into the vector pSCT Gal-X-556 (27Rusconi S. Severne Y. Geargiev O. Galli I. Wieland S. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Three double mutations were generated at basic residues located upstream of the NH2 terminus of mature lactase: R829T/R832T, K853T/R854T, and K866T/R868T (see Fig. 4). Prepro-LPH cDNA was subcloned from the plasmid pSCTmLPH (human prepro-LPH (25Oberholzer T. Mantei N. Semenza G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) into the vector pGEM-2 (Promega, Switzerland). A 3.5-kilobase fragment was deleted with PvuII and the resulting plasmid used for site-directed mutagenesis using the Unique Site Elimination mutagenesis kit (Pharmacia, Switzerland). The mutagenesis reactions were performed with the following mutant sense primers (the nucleotides causing the mutation are underlined): LPH R829T/R832T, 5′-GC AGC AAG TCA ACG ACT CCC ACG AAA TCT GCC-3′; LPH K853T/R854T, 5′-CC AAG GGG GCA ACA ACA CTG CTA CCA CC-3′; LPH K866T/R868T, 5′-C CTC CCC TCC ACA GTC ACA GCC TTC ACT TTT CC-3′. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the following sense primer: 5′-CCT TCT GGT TAC AGC CAG CGG-3′. After mutation, the 3.5-kilobase PvuII fragment was reinserted. The final expression vectors, pcDNA I/Amp LPH R829T/R832T, pcDNA I/Amp LPH K853T/R854T, pcDNA I/Amp LPH K866T/R868T, and pcDNA I/Amp LPH wt (wild type), were constructed by cloning the mutated and wt LPH cDNA into the EcoRI site of pcDNA I/Amp (Invitrogen, Switzerland). COS-7 cells, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Switzerland), were transiently transfected as described by Chen and Okayama (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). One day before transfection, the cells were seeded into six-well plates, to reach approximately 80% confluence the next day. During the last 30 min before transfection, the cells were incubated in 1.5 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 3.5% CO2. The calcium phosphate-DNA mixture was prepared by mixing 5 μg of plasmid DNA with 100 μl of 250 mm CaCl2 and 100 μl of 2 × BBS (50 mm BES, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, pH adjusted with NaOH to exactly 6.95) and incubating for 15 min at room temperature. 150 μl of this mixture was then added slowly to the cells, and incubation was continued for 24 h at 37 °C and 3.5% CO2. The following day, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), refed 2 ml of fresh medium, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For metabolic labeling studies, the cells were washed with minimal essential medium (methionine-free) 48 h after transfection and then incubated in 2 ml of methionine-free labeling medium (minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum) for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After depletion of methionine, the cells were pulse labeled in 1 ml of labeling medium containing 25 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham, Switzerland, specific activity > 1,000 Ci/mmol) for the time period indicated. The cells were washed twice with PBS and chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 10 mm methionine. In some experiments, brefeldin A (BFA) was added to all media at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. The furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (29Hallenberger S. Bosch V. Angliker H. Shaw E. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) was added to all media needed at a final concentration of 100 μm. The labeled cells were collected and solubilized in 400 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01 volume of 100 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 volume of inhibitor mixture (0.25 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.06 mg/ml aprotinin, 1.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 4.7 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.24 mg/ml bestatin, 0.3 mg/ml E-64, and 38.3 mg/mlo-phenanthroline). Immunoprecipitations, using a monoclonal mouse anti-human LPH antibody (30Hauri H.P. Sterchi E. Bienz D. Fransen J. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), were performed as described by Lottaz et al. (31Lottaz D. Oberholzer T. Bahler P. Semenza G. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In some experiments equal volumes of cell lysates were treated with 50 μg of trypsin for different time intervals at 37 °C, and then the reaction was stopped with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the inhibitor mixture, and 200 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The samples were then processed further for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from Sepharose beads by boiling in 30 μl of 100 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 0.2% SDS for 4 min. Then 3 μl of 10 × Glyco F buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 5% Nonidet P40) and 200 milliunits of peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F, Boehringer, Switzerland) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Samples (immunoprecipitates and proteins subjected to PNGase F treatment) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 5% acrylamide gels according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The gels were stained and fixed with Coomassie Blue R-250 in 10% ethanol and 5% acetic acid, destained, and treated with Amplify (Amersham, Switzerland) for 30 min, dried, and then exposed to Fuji RX medical x-ray films at −80 °C. The percentage of processed human LPH was obtained by quantifying the radioactivity in the dried gels with a PhosphoImager scanner using Imagequant 3.2 software (both from Molecular Dynamics). Transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed for 30 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, treated for 15 min with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, and permeabilized or not for 5 min with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. LPH wt and its mutants were detected with the monoclonal anti-human LPH antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Tago, Switzerland). COS-7 cells transfected with LPH wt or LPH mutants were detached with a rubber policeman and collected in cold PBS. The cells were disrupted with a conical grinding pestle and sonicated (15 s, 60 watts). Lactase activity was determined as described by Wackeret al. (2Wacker H. Keller P. Falchetto R. Legler G. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18744-18752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell homogenates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 33 mm sodium maleate buffer, pH 6.0, using 33 mm lactose as substrate. After boiling for 2 min the liberated d-glucose was determined at 365 nm withd-glucose dehydrogenase (Merck). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Pro-LPH and mature-like LPH were immunopurified from COS-7 transfected cells, separated by gel electrophoresis, and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was washed and stained in 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 50% methanol. Individual protein bands were cut from the membrane. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of a portion of each band was determined by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 470 gas phase Sequencer. When radioactive amino acid sequencing was performed, COS-7 cells cotransfected with prepro-LPH and furin cDNAs were labeled with [3H]phenylalanine for 1 h and chased for 16 h. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, then radioactive bands were excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and used directly for protein sequence determination. Radioactivity in each cycle was determined by collecting the anilinothiazolinone amino acid derivatives and counting in a Beckman LS1801 scintillation counter. Human prepro-LPH undergoes a number of incompletely described proteolytic cleavage events in the constitutive secretion pathway in vivo. To study the processing of human prepro-LPH in detail we used COS-7 cells as a model. This cell line was used successfully in our laboratory to study the processing of rabbit lactase (23Keller P. Zecca L. Boukamel R. Zwicker E. Gloor S. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25722-25728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows that the lactase precursor, immunopurified from transiently transfected COS-7 cells, is processed to a 150-kDa mature or mature-like protein. This processing, however, takes place far more slowly than in enterocytes. COS-7 cells need almost 3 days to process pro-LPH completely to the 150-kDa mature or mature-like protein. To investigate the processing in detail, we first examined whether cleavage of prepro-LPH by signal peptidase in COS-7 cells occurred at the same position as expected in enterocytes (1Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and as found in MDCK cells transfected with prepro-LPH cDNA (4Wüthrich M. Grünberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I. Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal amino acid sequence determination of immunopurified pro-LPH confirms that the cleavage takes place after Gly19, i.e. where predicted for human prepro-LPH (1Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). However, for the further processing of pro-LPH to mature or mature-like LPH, we failed to obtain an unambiguous NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of this LPH form (approximately 150 kDa) slowly generated in COS-7 cells, suggesting that pro-LPH is cleaved at more than one site in COS-7 cells. We have shown previously that predominantly furin, PC1/3, and/or PC6A are implicated in the processing of rabbit pro-LPH to generate the 180-kDa intermediate form (23Keller P. Zecca L. Boukamel R. Zwicker E. Gloor S. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25722-25728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether furin generates human mature-like LPH. Furin is localized mainly in the trans-Golgi network with ubiquitous tissue distribution (12Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Day R. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it can translocate between the cell surface and the trans-Golgi network (34Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 35Vey M. Schafer W. Berghofer S. Klenk H.D. Garten W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1829-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), a behavior that is in agreement with its proposed role in multiple processing events. To examine the potential of furin to cleave human pro-LPH in detail, COS-7 cells were transfected with the full-length cDNA of prepro-LPH together with the cDNA of furin. Fig. 2 A shows that furin is able to increase the amount of protein referred to as mature-like LPH approximately 3-fold after 5 h of chase. The apparent molecular mass is very similar to the mass of mature-like lactase generated by endogenous proteases in COS-7 cells (150 kDa). This is more clearly visible after deglycosylation with PNGase F (Fig. 2 B). Processing is blocked by BFA (Fig. 2 A), which interrupts transport from the ER to the Golgi. Processing of pro-LPH in the small intestine is known to take place in thetrans-Golgi network or in a later compartment (31Lottaz D. Oberholzer T. Bahler P. Semenza G. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 37Rossi M. Maiuri L. Salvati V.M. Russomanno C. Auricchio S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), where furin is also known to be located. The enhanced processing of pro-LPH by coexpressed furin is inhibited by the membrane-permeant specific inhibitor of furin decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (29Hallenberger S. Bosch V. Angliker H. Shaw E. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) when added to the medium during the pulse-chase period (Fig. 2 C). This inhibitor is not able to inhibit processing of lactase by COS-7 cell endogenous proteases (although there is a reduction in the amount of immunoprecipitated LPH forms, the inhibitor does not alter the ratio between the 220-kDa pro-LPH and the 150-kDa mature-like form). The cleavage of human pro-LPH in non-furin-transfected COS-7 cells must thus be caused by other proteases. The results described in the preceding paragraph show that overexpressed furin elevates the split of pro-LPH to a mature-like protein in COS-7 cells. At least two furin motifs are present in human pro-LPH shortly upstream of the mature NH2 terminus (i.e. at Arg832 and Lys-Arg854, Fig. 3 A). To identify the cleavage site used by furin, COS-7 cells, cotransfected with prepro-LPH and furin cDNA, were labeled with [3H]phenylalanine. The lactase forms were immunoprecipitated, and mature-like lactases were subjected to radioactive amino acid sequencing. The results (Fig. 3 B) show that human pro-LPH is cleaved by furin after the motif R-T-P-R832 (Fig. 3 A) to generate a NH2 terminus starting at Lys833. This protein is 36 amino acids longer than the native, mature LPH found in the brush-border membrane (NH2 terminus, Ala869) (1Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 38Montgomery R.K. Büller H.A. Rings E.H.H.M. Grand R.J. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2824-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To provide further experimental evidence for the cleavage of pro-LPH by furin, we altered the furin motif R-T-P-R by site-directed mutagenesis (mutant pro-LPH R829T/R832T) and generated two additional mutants: pro-LPH K853T/R854T (a dibasic site located between the former and the final NH2 terminus) and pro-LPH K866T/R868T (thus abolishing the K-V-R motif just in front of the native NH2 terminus of mature LPH) (Fig. 4 A). All constructs as well as wt prepro-LPH were expressed in COS-7 cells. The cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h and chased for 6 h. Immunoprecipitation of LPH wt with the antibody against the mature lactase reveals 210/220-kDa species (the range of sizes of pro-LPH, high mannose and complex glycosylated, respectively) and a weak (10% of total) 150-kDa protein (approximately the size of mature LPH) (Fig. 4 B). Immunoprecipitations of lactase mutants K853T/R854T and K866T/R868T showed a pattern similar to that of lactase wt. In contrast, immunoprecipitation of mutant pro-LPH R829T/R832T revealed only one polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 210 kDa which corresponded to the size of the high mannose form (Fig. 4 B). In the presence of cotransfected furin we could again observe the furin-mediated enhanced processing of wt pro-LPH as well as the enhanced processing of the mutants K853T/R854T and K866T/R868T. However, in the presence of coexpressed furin the mutant R829T/R832T is not processed (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were obtained with LoVo and Ltk− cells (data not shown). To examine the fate of this mutant R829T/R832T two parameters were studied: lactase enzymatic activity and cellular localization of this mutant. Fig. 4 C (white bars) shows that lactase activities of wt and the mutant proteins K853T/R854T and K866T/R868T are clearly measurable (although the activity of mutant K866T/R868T is somewhat lower). Mutant R829T/R832T, in contrast, does not display detectable lactase activity. Similar results were obtained in the presence of furin (Fig. 4 C, black bars). Because the enzymatic activity of pro-LPH is known to be the same as that of mature LPH (39Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the absence of activity cannot simply be attributed to incomplete processing of the pro-LPH mutant R829T/R832T. We tested whether mutant R829T/R832T had reached the plasma membrane. COS-7 cells were transfected with wt or mutant cDNAs of prepro-LPH. 48 h later, the cells were fixed and either permeabilized with Triton X-100 or not permeabilized. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to localize the lactase forms. Pro-LPH wt (a) and mutants K853T/R854T (c) and K866T/R868T (d) are found on the cell surface and also in intracellular compartments (probably the ER and Golgi) (Fig. 5). Mutant R829T/R832T (b), however, is detectable only after cell permeabilization and is localized around the nucleus, i.e. it is retained intracellularly. This observation is in agreement with the result shown in Fig. 4 B for this mutation, where only the 210-kDa precursor, indicative of high mannose pro-LPH, was expressed. The same immunolocalization of pro-LPH wt and mutants was found in cells cotransfected with furin (data not shown). It is known that the treatment of pro-LPH molecules with trypsin alone generates a lactase with an apparent molecular mass similar to that of brush-border mature LPH (39Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears likely that subsequent cleavage of human mature-like LPH by trypsin leads to the generation of the “mature” enzyme in vivo. To provide evidence for this assumption, we incubated cell extracts from COS-7 cotransfected with or without furin with trypsin and analyzed the proteins by SDS-PAGE before and after deglycosylation with PNGase F (Fig. 6). Deglycosylated mature-like LPH treated with trypsin has an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa (corresponding to the calculated mass of 120,993 Da of mature human intestinal lactase). Deglycosylated mature-like LPH not treated with trypsin has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 124 kDa. This small shift in the molecular mass of mature-like LPH produced by COS-7 cells is independent of the presence or absence of overexpressed furin, indicating again that endogenous COS-7 proteases cleave pro-LPH very close to or at the furin motif around Arg832. These results suggest that the brush-border mature LPH is most probably produced by a multistep processing involving, e.g. furin, perhaps more PC(s), aminopeptidases, granzyme A (52Haddad P. Jenne D.E. Krähenbühl O. Tschopp J. Sitkovsky M.V. Henkart P.A. Cytotoxic Cells: Recognition, Effector Function, Generation and Methods. Birkhäuser, Boston, 1993: 251-262Google Scholar), and/or pancreatic proteases (e.g. trypsin). Intestinal human lactase is synthesized as a large precursor (prepro-LPH) of 1927 amino acid residues which is subjected to a number of proteolytic and other events before (and probably also after) reaching the final destination, the brush-border membrane. As prepared from this membrane, human LPH is a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass (by SDS-PAGE) of approximately 150–160 kDa, encompassing the amino acid sequence from Ala869 to the COOH terminus (calculated molecular mass of the polypeptide chain, 120,993 Da). Mature brush-border LPH corresponds, therefore, to the COOH-terminal 56% of the original sequence of prepro-LPH. Although number, types, and cellular sites of the proteolytic events producing mature LPH from prepro-LPH have been studied extensively, albeit with controversial results, much less has been learned about t"
