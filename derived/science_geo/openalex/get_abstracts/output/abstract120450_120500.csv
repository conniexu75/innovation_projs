https://openalex.org/W2090630729,"Rare individuals have been multiply exposed to HIV-1 but remain uninfected. The CD4+ T-cells of two of these individuals, designated EU2 and EU3, are highly resistant in vitro to the entry of primary macrophagetropic virus but are readily infectable with transformed T-cell line adapted viruses. We report here on the genetic basis of this resistance. We found that EU2 and EU3 have a homozygous defect in CKR-5, the gene encoding the recently described coreceptor for primary HIV-1 isolates. These individuals appear to have inherited a defective CKR-5 allele that contains an internal 32 base pair deletion. The encoded protein is severely truncated and cannot be detected at the cell surface. Surprisingly, this defect has no obvious phenotype in the affected individuals. Thus, a CKR-5 allele present in the human population appears to protect homozygous individuals from sexual transmission of HIV-1. Heterozygous individuals are quite common (approximately 20%) in some populations. These findings indicate the importance of CKR-5 in HIV-1 transmission and suggest that targeting the HIV-1-CKR-5 interaction may provide a means of preventing or slowing disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2049106847,"Patterning matter on the nanometre scale is an important objective of current materials chemistry and physics. It is driven by both the need to further miniaturize electronic components and the fact that at the nanometre scale, materials properties are strongly size-dependent and thus can be tuned sensitively. In nanoscale crystals, quantum size effects and the large number of surface atoms influence the, chemical, electronic, magnetic and optical behaviour. 'Top-down' (for example, lithographic) methods for nanoscale manipulation reach only to the upper end of the nanometre regime; but whereas 'bottom-up' wet chemical techniques allow for the preparation of mono-disperse, defect-free crystallites just 1-10 nm in size, ways to control the structure of nanocrystal assemblies are scarce. Here we describe a strategy for the synthesis of 'nanocrystal molecules', in which discrete numbers of gold nanocrystals are organized into spatially defined structures based on Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions. We attach single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides of defined length and sequence to individual nanocrystals, and these assemble into dimers and trimers on addition of a complementary single-stranded DNA template. We anticipate that this approach should allow the construction of more complex two- and three-dimensional assemblies."

https://openalex.org/W2090636859,"XTcf-3 is a maternally expressed Xenopus homolog of the mammalian HMG box factors Tcf-1 and Lef-1. The N-terminus of XTcf-3 binds to beta-catenin. Microinjection of XTcf-3 mRNA in embryos results in nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. The beta-catenin-XTcf-3 complex activates transcription in a transient reporter gene assay, while XTcf-3 by itself is silent. N-terminal deletion of XTcf-3 (delta N) abrogates the interaction with beta-catenin, as well as the consequent transcription activation. This dominant-negative delta N mutant suppresses the induction of axis duplication by microinjected beta-catenin. It also suppresses endogenous axis specification upon injection into the dorsal blastomeres of a 4-cell-stage embryo. We propose that signaling by beta-catenin involves complex formation with XTcf-3, followed by nuclear translocation and activation of specific XTcf-3 target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2062148688,"A putative chemokine receptor that we previously cloned and termed LESTR has recently been shown to function as a co-receptor (termed fusin) for lymphocyte-tropic HIV-1 strains. Cells expressing CD4 became permissive to infection with T-cell-line-adapted HIV-1 strains of the syncytium-inducing phenotype after transfection with LESTR/fusin complementary DNA. We report here the indentification of a human chemokine of the CXC type, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), as the natural ligand for LESTR/fusin, and we propose the term CXCR-4 for this receptor, in keeping with the new chemokine-receptor nomenclature. SDF-1 activates Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with CXCR-4 cDNA as well as blood leukocytes and lymphocytes. In cell lines expressing CXCR-4 and CD4, and in blood lymphocytes, SDF-1 is a powerful inhibitor of infection by lymphocyte-tropic HIV-1 strains, whereas the CC chemokines RANTES, MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta, which were shown previously to prevent infection with primary, monocyte-tropic viruses, are inactive. In combination with CC chemokines, which block the infection with monocyte/macrophage-tropic viruses, SDF-1 could help to decrease virus load and prevent the emergence of the syncytium-inducing viruses which are characteristic of the late stages of AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2075175573,"The majority of early-onset cases of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are linked to mutations in two related genesPS1 and PS2, located on chromosome 14 and 1, respectively. Using two highly specific antibodies against nonoverlapping epitopes of the PS1- encoded polypeptide, termed presenilin 1 (PS1), we document that the preponderant PS1-related species that accumulate in cultured mammalian cells, and in the brains of rodents, primates, and humans are ∼27–28 kDa N-terminal and ∼16–17 kDa C-terminal derivatives. Notably, a FAD-linked PS1 variant that lacks exon 9 is not subject to endoproteolytic cleavage. In brains of transgenic mice expressing human PS1, ∼17 kDa and ∼27 kDa PS1 derivatives accumulate to saturable levels, and at ∼1:1 stoichiometry, independent of transgene-derived mRNA. We conclude that PS1 is subject to endoproteolytic processing in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2062732100,"In the Arabidopsis root meristem, initial cells undergo asymmetric divisions to generate the cell lineages of the root. The scarecrow mutation results in roots that are missing one cell layer owing to the disruption of an asymmetric division that normally generates cortex and endodermis. Tissue-specific markers indicate that a heterogeneous cell type is formed in the mutant. The deduced amino acid sequence of SCARECROW (SCR) suggests that it is a member of a novel family of putative transcription factors. SCR is expressed in the cortex/endodermal initial cells and in the endodermal cell lineage. Tissue-specific expression is regulated at the transcriptional level. These results indicate a key role for SCR in regulating the radial organization of the root."
https://openalex.org/W2038894508,"We report that the many Eph-related receptor tyrosine kinases, and their numerous membrane-bound ligands, can each be grouped into only two major specificity subclasses. Receptors in a given subclass bind most members of a corresponding ligand subclass. The physiological relevance of these groupings is suggested by viewing the collective distributions of all members of a subclass. These composite distributions, in contrast with less informative patterns seen with individual members of the family, reveal that the developing embryo is subdivided into domains defined by reciprocal and apparently mutually exclusive expression of a receptor subclass and its corresponding ligands. Receptors seem to encounter their ligands only at the interface between these domains. This reciprocal compartmentalization implicates the Eph family in the formation of spatial boundaries that may help to organize the developing body plan."
https://openalex.org/W2106267269,"Axo-dendritic synaptogenesis was examined in live hippocampal cell cultures using the fluorescent dyes DiO to label dendrites and FM 4-64 to label functional presynaptic boutons. As the first functional synaptic boutons appeared in these cultures, numerous filopodia (up to 10 micron long) were observed to extend transiently (mean lifetime 9.5 min) from dendritic shafts. With progressively increasing numbers of boutons, there were coincident decreases in numbers of transient filopodia and increases in numbers of stable dendritic spines. Dendritic filopodia were observed to initiate physical contacts with nearby axons. This sometimes resulted in filopodial stabilization and formation of functional presynaptic boutons. These findings suggest that dendritic filopodia may actively initiate synaptogenic contacts with nearby (5-10 micron) axons and thereafter evolve into dendritic spines."

https://openalex.org/W2029445497,"A novel class of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins has been identified recently. Genetic evidence suggests that RGS proteins inhibit G protein-mediated signaling at the level of the receptor-G protein interaction or the G protein alpha subunit itself. We have found that two RGS family members, GAIP and RGS4, are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), accelerating the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gi alpha 1 at least 40-fold. All Gi subfamily members assayed were substrates for these GAPs; Gs alpha was not. RGS4 activates the GTPase activity of certain Gi alpha 1 mutants (e.g., R178C), but not others (e.g., Q204L). The GAP activity of RGS proteins is consistent with their proposed role as negative regulators of G protein-mediated signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2075947758,"During development of the Drosophila peripheral nervous system, a sensory organ precursor (SOP) cell undergoes rounds of asymmetric divisions to generate four distinct cells of a sensory organ. Numb, a membrane-associated protein, is asymmetrically segregated into one daughter cell during SOP division and acts as an inherited determinant of cell fate. Here, we show that Notch, a transmembrane receptor mediating cell–cell communication, functions as a binary switch in cell fate specification during asymmetric divisions of the SOP and its daughter cells in embryogenesis. Moreovernumb negatively regulates Notch, probably through direct protein–protein interaction that requires the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of Numb and either the RAM23 region or the very C-terminal end of Notch. Notch then positively regulates a transcription factor encoded bytramtrack (ttk). This leads to Ttk expression in the daughter cell that does not inherit Numb. Thus, the inherited determinant Numb bestows a bias in the machinery for cell–cell communication to allow the specification of distinct daughter cell fates."

https://openalex.org/W2016856383,"The perceptual world is organized hierarchically: the forest consists of trees, which in turn have leaves. Visual attention can emphasize the overall picture (global form) or the focal details of a scene (local components). Neuropsychological studies have indicated that the left hemisphere is biased towards local and the right towards global processing. The underlying attentional and perceptual mechanisms are maximally impaired by unilateral lesions to the temporal and parietal cortex. We measured brain activity of normal subjects during two experiments using 'hierarchically' organized figures. In a directed attention task, early visual processing (prestriate) areas were activated: attention to the global aspect of the figures activated the right lingual gyrus whereas locally directed attention activated the left inferior occipital cortex. In a subsequent divided attention task, the number of target switches from local to global (and vice versa) covaried with temporal-parietal activation. The findings provide direct evidence for hemispheric specialization in global and local perception; furthermore, they indicate that temporal-parietal areas exert attentional control over the neural transformations occurring in prestriate cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2059124316,"Chapsyn-110, a novel membrane-associated putative guanylate kinase (MAGUK) that binds directly to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and Shaker K+ channel subunits, is 70%-80% identical to, and shares an identical domain organization with, PSD-95/SAP90 and SAP97. In rat brain, chapsyn-110 protein shows a somatodendritic expression pattern that overlaps partly with PSD-95 but that contrasts with the axonal distribution of SAP97. Chapsyn-110 associates tightly with the postsynaptic density in brain, and mediates the clustering of both NMDA receptors and K+ channels in heterologous cells. Indeed, chapsyn-110 and PSD-95 can heteromultimerize with each other and are recruited into the same NMDA receptor and K+ channel clusters. Thus, chapsyn-110 and PSD-95 may interact at postsynaptic sites to form a multimeric scaffold for the clustering of receptors, ion channels, and associated signalling proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2141236652,"During Drosophila neurogenesis, differential segregation of Numb is necessary for daughter cells of asymmetric divisions to adopt distinct fates, at least partly by biasing the Notch-mediated cell-cell interaction. We have isolated a highly conserved mammalian homolog of Drosophila numb, m-numb. During mouse cortical neurogenesis, m-Numb is asymmetrically localized to the apical membrane of dividing ventricular neural progenitors. Depending upon the orientation of the cleavage plane, m-Numb may be distributed into one or both of the daughter cells. When expressed in Drosophila embryos, m-Numb is localized asymmetrically in dividing neural precursors and rescues the numb mutant phenotype. Furthermore, m-Numb can physically interact with mouse Notch1. We propose that some shared molecular mechanisms, both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic, generate asymmetric cell divisions during neurogenesis of vertebrates and invertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W2075784029,"Ku is a heterodimeric DNA end binding complex composed of 70 and 86 kDa subunits. Here, we show that Ku86 is essential for normal V(D)J recombination in vivo, as Ku86-deficient mice are severely defective for formation of coding joints. Unlike severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice, Ku86-deficient mice are also defective for signal joint formation. Both hairpin coding ends and blunt full-length signal ends accumulate. Contrary to expectation, Ku86 is evidently not required for protection of either type of V(D)J recombination intermediate. Instead, V(D)J recombination appears to be arrested after the cleavage step in Ku86-deficient mice. We suggest that Ku86 may be required to remodel or disassemble DNA-protein complexes containing broken ends, making them available for further processing and joining."

https://openalex.org/W1982289883,"Asymmetric cell divisions play a key role in establishing neuronal diversity in the mammalian and Drosophila CNS, but the mechanisms involved are mostly unknown. The Drosophila MP2 precursor divides asymmetrically to generate the dMP2/vMP2 interneurons. Delta–Notch signaling is required to specify vMP2 fate, whereas the localized determinant Numb is segregated into dMP2 and is required to specify dMP2 fate. Notch; numb double mutants have two dMP2 neurons; hence, Numb is not required for dMP2 fate, but antagonizes the Delta–Notch “vMP2” signal. In vivo Delta expression and in vitro culture experiments show that vMP2 fate is specified by an “inductive” signal from outside the MP2 lineage. Thus, intrinsic and extrinsic cues converge to specify binary cell fates in the MP2 cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1982100899,"The immunophilin FKBP12 is an evolutionarily conserved abundant protein; however, its physiological roles remain poorly defined. Here we report that FKBP12 is a common cytoplasmic interactor of TGFβ family type I receptors. FKBP12 binds to ligand-free TGFβ type I receptor, from which it is released upon a ligand-induced, type II receptor mediated phosphorylation of the type I receptor. Blocking FKBP12/type I receptor interaction with FK506 nonfunctional derivatives enhances the ligand activity, indicating that FKBP12 binding is inhibitory to the signaling pathways of the TGFβ family ligands. Overexpression of a myristylated FKBP12 in Mv1Lu cell specifically inhibits two separate pathways activated by TGFβ, and two point mutations on FKBP12 (G89P, I90K) abolish the inhibitory activity of FKBP12, suggesting that FKBP12 may dock a cytoplasmic protein to the type I receptors to inhibit TGFβ family mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2156511976,"Early in development, neural progenitors in cerebral cortex normally produce neurons of several layers during successive cell divisions. The laminar fate of their daughters depends on environmental cues encountered just before mitosis. At the close of neurogenesis, however, cortical progenitors normally produce neurons destined only for the upper layers. To assess the developmental potential of these cells, upper-layer progenitors were transplanted into the cerebral cortex of younger hosts, in which deep-layer neurons were being generated. These studies reveal that late cortical progenitors are not competent to generate deep-layer neurons and are instead restricted to producing the upper layers."

However, H1 is required for the normal basal repression of a gene (ngoA) in growing cells but is not required for its activated expression in starved cells. Surprisingly, H1 is required for the activated expression of another gene (CyP) in starved cells but not for its repression in growing cells. Thus, H1 does not have a major effect on global transcription but can act as either a positive or negative gene-specific regulator of transcription in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2057075902,"In budding yeast, cell division is initiated in late G1 phase once the Cdc28 cyclin-dependent kinase is activated by the G1 cyclins Cln1, Cln2, and Cln3. The extreme instability of the Cln proteins couples environmental signals, which regulate Cln synthesis, to cell division. We isolated Cdc53 as a Cln2-associated protein and show that Cdc53 is required for Cln2 instability and ubiquitination in vivo. The Cln2–Cdc53 interaction, Cln2 ubiquitination, and Cln2 instability all depend on phosphorylation of Cln2. Cdc53 also binds the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Cdc34. These findings suggest that Cdc53 is a component of a ubiquitin–protein ligase complex that targets phosphorylated G1 cyclins for degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1991537855,"Using capacitance measurements and the single-cell immunoblot assay to study secretion in dorsal root ganglion neurons, we found that the somata underwent robust exocytosis upon depolarization and released substance P, in response to KCl stimulation. The parallel changes between capacitance responses and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) at different membrane potentials and the inhibition of exocytosis by Ca2+ chelators suggest that soma release is Ca(2+)-dependent. We also assessed the level of Ca2+ required for exocytosis by raising the average [Ca2+]i with the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin. Capacitance changes were triggered by cytosolic Ca2+ > 0.6 microM; the [Ca2+]i at the release sites during depolarizations was estimated to be 3-10 microM. These Ca2+ levels are similar to those obtained from neuroendocrine cells, but are at least 10 times lower than those required for transmitter release from nerve terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2072157553,"Repeated exposure to psychomotor stimulants produce long-term changes in behavior ranging from addiction to behavioral sensitization. Many of these behaviors depend on the nigrostriatal system of the basal ganglia. We show here that chronic cocaine exposure not only leads to time-varying alterations in the inducibility of bZIP transcription factors in individual striatal neurons, but also to long-lasting network changes in which ensembles of striatal neurons express these proteins. These network-level adaptations suggest that the behavioral sensitization induced by repeated psychomotor stimulant exposure may reflect an enduring functional reorganization of basal ganglia circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1979160989,"Bcl-2 is a major regulator of programmed cell death, a critical process in shaping the developing nervous system. To assess whether Bcl-2 is involved in regulating neuronal survival and in mediating the neuroprotective action of neurotrophic factors, we generated Bcl-2-deficient mice. At birth, the number of facial motoneurons, sensory, and sympathetic neurons was not significantly changed, and axotomy-induced degeneration of facial motoneurons could still be prevented by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Interestingly, substantial degeneration of motoneurons, sensory, and sympathetic neurons occurred after the physiological cell death period. Accordingly, Bcl-2 is not a permissive factor for the action of neurotrophic factors, and although it does not influence prenatal neuronal survival, it is crucial for the maintenance of specific populations of neurons during the early postnatal period."
https://openalex.org/W2025457180,"We have examined the mechanism by which growth factor-mediated induction of the Ras pathway interferes with signaling via the second messenger cAMP. Activation of cellular Ras with insulin or NGF stimulated recruitment of the S6 kinase pp90RSK to the signal-dependent coactivator CBP. Formation of the pp90RSK-CBP complex occurred with high stoichiometry and persisted for 6-8 hr following growth factor addition. pp90RSK specifically recognized the E1A-binding domain of the coactivator CBP. In addition, like E1A, binding of pp90RSK to CBP was sufficient to repress transcription of cAMP-responsive genes via the cAMP-inducible factor CREB. By contrast with its effects on the cAMP pathway, formation of the pp90RSK-CBP complex was required for induction of Ras-responsive genes. These results provide a demonstration of cross-coupling between two signaling pathways that occurs at the level of a signal-dependent coactivator."
https://openalex.org/W1989575185,"The development of the visual centers of the Drosophila brain is tightly regulated by the ingrowth of retinal axons from the developing eye. In the first optic ganglion, the lamina, arriving retinal axons trigger the precursors of their synaptic partners to complete a final cell division and commence neural differentiation. The secreted product of the hedgehog gene regulates the temporal assembly of photoreceptor precursor cells into ommatidial clusters in the compound eye. Here, we show that Hedgehog is transmitted along the retinal axons to serve as the inductive signal in the brain. Hedgehog acts in the first of two retinal axon-mediated steps in the assembly of lamina synaptic cartridges. These observations provide a novel insight into the molecular interactions that orchestrate the assembly of neural precursor cells into precise synaptic circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2048288169,"We describe the genetic and kinetic defects for a low- affinity fast channel disease of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) that causes a myasthenic syndrome. In two unrelated patients with very small miniature end plate (EP) potentials, but with normal EP AChR density and normal EP ultrastructure, patch-clamp studies demonstrated infrequent AChR channel events, diminished channel reopenings during ACh occupancy, and resistance to desensitization by ACh. Each patient had two heteroallelic AChR ε subunit gene mutations: a common εP121L mutation, a signal peptide mutation (εG-8R) (patient 1), and a glycosylation consensus site mutation (εS143L) (patient 2). AChR expression in HEK fibroblasts was normal with εP121L but was markedly reduced with the other mutations. Therefore, εP121L defines the clinical phenotype. Studies of the engineered εP121L AChR revealed a markedly decreased rate of channel opening, little change in affinity of the resting state for ACh, but reduced affinity of the open channel and desensitized states."
https://openalex.org/W2095552729,"The muscle-derived factors required for survival of embryonic motoneurons are not clearly identified. Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a cytokine related to ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), is expressed at high levels in embryonic limb bud and is secreted by differentiated myotubes. In vitro, CT-1 kept 43% of purified E14 rat motoneurons alive for 2 weeks (EC50 = 20 pM). In vivo, CT-1 protected neonatal sciatic motoneurons against the effects of axotomy. CT-1 action on motoneurons was inhibited by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC), suggesting that CT-1 may act through a GPI-linked component. Since no binding of CT-1 to CNTFR alpha was detected, CT-1 may use a novel cytokine receptor alpha subunit. CT-1 may be important in normal motoneuron development and as a potential tool for slowing motoneuron degeneration in human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2068703549,"The sigma factor sigma 70 of E. coli RNA polymerase acts not only in initiation, but also at an early stage of elongation to induce a transcription pause, and simultaneously to allow the phage lambda gene Q transcription antiterminator to act. We identify the signal in DNA that induces early pausing to be a version of the sigma 70 -10 promoter consensus, and we show that sigma 70 is both necessary for pausing and present in the paused transcription complex. Regions 2 and 3 of sigma 70 suffice to induce pausing. Since pausing is induced by the nontemplate DNA strand of the open transcription bubble, we conclude that RNA polymerase containing sigma 70 carries out base-specific recognition of the nontemplate strand as single stranded DNA. We suggest that sigma 70 remains bound to core RNA polymerase when the -10 promoter contacts are broken, and then moves to the pause-inducing sequence."

https://openalex.org/W2093612041,"tRNA maturation consists of the specific removal of precursor sequences from both the 5' and 3' termini of an initial RNA transcript. How this is accomplished has heretofore not been ascertained in any system. Using Northern analysis of RNA isolated from a variety of RNase-deficient E. coli strains, we have identified the processing intermediates that accumulate in the absence of specific processing nucleases. From this information we have established the maturation pathways for 12 different E. coli tRNAs including the specific role of each of the relevant RNases in the process. The surprising conclusion from this work is that tRNA maturation is a stochastic process that lacks a defined order and that can proceed with a variety of alternative 3' processing nucleases."
https://openalex.org/W2089417576,"Growth and patterning of the Drosophila leg are organized by three secreted proteins: Hedgehog (Hh), Wingless (Wg), and Decapentaplegic (Dpp). Hh is secreted by posterior cells; it acts at short range to induce dorsal anterior cells to secrete Dpp and ventral anterior cells to secrete Wg. Here we show that the complementary patterns of dpp and wg expression are maintained by mutual repression: Dpp signaling blocks wg transcription, whereas Wg signaling attenuates dpp transcription. We also show that this mutual repression is essential for normal axial patterning because it ensures that the dorsalizing and ventralizing activities of Dpp and Wg are restricted to opposite sides of the leg primordium and meet only at the center of the primordium to distalize the appendage."

https://openalex.org/W1987735963,RNA polymerase recognizes its promoters through base-specific interaction between defined segments of DNA and the σ subunit of the enzyme. This interaction leads to separation of base pairs and exposure of the template strand for RNA synthesis. We show that base-specific recognition by the σ70 holoenzyme in this process involves primarily nontemplate strand bases in the −10 promoter region. We suggest that melting involves the persistence of these contacts as the bound duplex (closed) form is converted to the single-stranded (open) form of the enzyme-promoter complex.
https://openalex.org/W1990679018,"We have studied synaptic plasticity in hippocampal cell cultures using a new imaging approach that allows unambiguous discrimination of presynaptic function at the level of single synaptic boutons. Employing a protocol designed to test for use-dependent plasticity resembling N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (NMDA-type LTP), we find that brief tetanic stimuli induce a potentiation of evoked synaptic vesicle turnover that lasts for at least 1 hr. Induction of this clearly presynaptic potentiation is blocked by putative postsynaptic glutamate receptor antagonists, suggesting that a retrograde induction signal might be involved. Potentiation appears to occur approximately equally at boutons of low and high initial release probabilities, and evidently does not involve an increase in the size of the total recycling synaptic vesicle pool."
https://openalex.org/W1970674827,"Cerebral deposition of amyloid beta protein (A beta) is an early and critical feature of Alzheimer's disease. A beta production requires the proteolytic release of A beta from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP). Thus, inhibition of A beta release is a prime therapeutic goal. Here, we show that the broad spectrum, irreversible serine protease inhibitor, AEBSF, inhibits the constitutive production of A beta in five different human cell lines, both neural and nonneural. AEBSF also stabilizes full-length beta APP and enhances alpha-secretion, as shown by an increase in the proteolytic derivative, alpha-APPS. Further, we demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of AEBSF is specific for A beta proteins starting at Aspartate 1, suggesting that AEBSF directly inhibits beta-secretase, the Methionine-Aspartate (Met-Asp)-cleaving enzyme. These results indicate that specific inhibition of this A beta-generating protease is possible in living human neural cells and provide information about the characteristics of this as yet unidentified enzyme."

The major intracellular form of RrSP-D accumulated in the RER as complexes containing up to four trimeric subunits. Disulfide cross-link formation and RrSP-D secretion were selectively inhibited by 2,2′-dipyridyl, an inhibitor of prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase, and by 2 mM dithiothreitol, but unaffected by tunicamycin or elimination of the consensus sequence for glycosylation at Asn70.

Surprisingly, the secretion of RrSP-Dser15/20 was unaffected by 2,2′-dipyridyl. These studies strongly suggest that the most important and rate-limiting step for the secretion of SP-D involves the association of cross-linked trimeric subunits to form dodecamers stabilized by specific inter-subunit disulfide cross-links. Interference with collagen helix formation prevents secretion by interfering with efficient disulfide cross-linking of the NH2-terminal domain.
