https://openalex.org/W2028461501,Weathering has had little differential effect on modal values of the index of refraction of pumice glasses from the eruptions of Mount Mazama and Glacier Peak thousands of years ago. Confidence is thus increased that the ranges of values for the index of refraction are reliable characteristics by which the two glasses may be distinguished from one another.

https://openalex.org/W2041463769,Five fossil maize-pollen grains were identified in a peat profile from Dismal Swamp. Extrapolation from the radiocarbon age of peat lower in the section suggests an age of 2200 years. The find suggests that a small clearing within the swamp was cultivated and thus supports the hypothesis that agriculture had diffused into coastal regions before the end of Early Woodland time.
