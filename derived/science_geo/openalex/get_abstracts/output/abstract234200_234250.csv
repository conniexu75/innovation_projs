This method is based on an as yet unexplained correlation between the usual ionosphere echoes (E, F and F 2) and the future movement or behaviour of the three main air masses, which make the weather all over the world: polar, maritime and tropical, or equatorial, as some people call it. Our results have already been published in the Bulletin of the Meteorological Society of America, in 1946, and in a paper sent to the last Pacific Science Congress held in New Zealand last February."

https://openalex.org/W2003237969,"MUCH work has been carried out upon the mechanisms whereby yeast is able to utilize nitrogen from amino-acids for its nutrition, and the mechanisms worked out by Ehrlich and Stickland illustrating nitrogen uptake are well known1,2. These and other authors (for example, Thorne3) have been concerned with the value of amino-acids to yeasts simply as sources of nitrogen. Working with aspartic acid and asparagine, however, we have for some time observed that yeast growth has been stimulated under some conditions to a remarkable extent if either aspartic acid or asparagine has been present in nutrient solutions containing sugars and inorganic salts and nutrilites under various conditions of wort aeration. Under several conditions of experimental procedure, always with good aeration, it has been found that aspartic acid and asparagine added in relatively large amounts have always had the effect of increasing the yield of yeast obtained from a standard amount of fermentable sugar. Thus, under one set of conditions, it has been found that the addition of 1 gm. of asparagine would yield an additional 2.7 gm. of yeast (at 27 per cent dry matter) or 0.729 gm. of yeast dry matter. Also, while we have never been able to obtain yields of yeast (at 27 per cent dry matter) greater than 210 per cent of the hexose sugar supplied, this figure has, under some conditions, been greatly exceeded when either aspartic acid or asparagine has been present in the wort in sufficient amount."

The present hypothesis suggests two series of alleles with near loci on the X-chromosome, N, r, r′, p and N′, g, d′, d, in which N and N′ stand for the normal genes, r for red anomaly, r′ for red anomaly with darkened red4, p for protanopia, g for green anomaly, d′ for deviant or anomalous deuter-anopia5, and d for ordinary deuteranopia. The orders of dominance are believed to be as shown above, N and N′ being the most dominant. The two-locus theory is supported by the observation that certain women carrying genes from both series are of normal phenotype1,2,6,7, and the discovery all over the world of fewer women defectives3 than would be expected on the single-locus theory by the calculation given by Ford8."

https://openalex.org/W2094651088,"IT is customary to assume that an enzyme fulfils the function in vivo that it exhibits in vitro, however surprising the conclusions to which this leads; yet it is frequently overlooked that, were its true function unknown, hæmoglobin might similarly be credited only with its powers of acting as a peroxidase, or absorbing carbon monoxide, neither of which would form a useful basis for a study of the physiology of blood. The extremely high concentration of urease found in a number of seeds is an interesting example of this type of problem; it can, for example, be readily calculated from the results below that the cotyledons of the seed of Citrullus (the water-melon) contain sufficient urease to decompose more than their own weight of urea every hour. Moreover, the technique used has been such that this result is almost certainly too low. An extensive literature on the occurrence of urease exists, virtually all of it directed to the production of pure or concentrated urease preparations for kinetic studies or urea determinations; the function of the urease in the seed receives in general no more than a puzzled mention."

https://openalex.org/W2094086436,"FROM the time of the original discovery of the virulence-enhancing power for bacteria of hog gastric mucin by Miller1 and, independently, Nungester2, the effect has been used extensively in the production of experimental infections of animals, as, for example, in chemotherapeutic and in serum testing (for review, see ref. 3). A large number of different species of bacteria show enhanced virulence when injected intraperitoneally together with the mucin, and the effect is often striking—a reduction of 104–106 in L.D.50 is frequent. Furthermore, the effect is not confined to hog gastric mucin: other mucins have been reported active. This suggests that the mucins coating epithelial surfaces may aid pathogenic bacteria in their initial attack; such a possibility makes the investigation of mucins for a chemical entity producing the effect an interesting problem."

https://openalex.org/W4249851930,THE theories of Mr. F. Hoyle and Prof. Pascual Jordan have renewed an interest in an important cosmological problem: How and when did the substance of the material universe come into existence ? It may facilitate discussion if the difficulties in the way of the various theories about this are summarized in the simplest possible terms.

The alga was associated with Nostochopsis lobatus (Wood) Geitler1, on the submerged rocks and small pebbles. The colonies appear as small brownish-green incrustations usually distributed on rock surfaces that are exposed directly to water currents. This is in contrast to the conditions in which Nostochopsis lobatus2 is found."
