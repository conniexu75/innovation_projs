However, the mechanism by which FFAs mediate lipoapoptosis is unclear. Because JNK activation is pivotal in both the metabolic syndrome accompanying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cellular apoptosis, we examined the role of JNK activation in FFA-induced lipoapoptosis. Multiple hepatocyte cell lines and primary mouse hepatocytes were treated in culture with monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. Despite equal cellular steatosis, apoptosis and JNK activation were greater during exposure to saturated versus monounsaturated FFAs. Inhibition of JNK, pharmacologically as well as genetically, reduced saturated FFA-mediated hepatocyte lipoapoptosis. Cell death was caspase-dependent and associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release indicating activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. JNK-dependent lipoapoptosis was associated with activation of Bax, a known mediator of mitochondrial dysfunction. As JNK can activate Bim, a BH3 domain-only protein capable of binding to and activating Bax, its role in lipoapoptosis was also examined. Small interfering RNA-targeted knock-down of Bim attenuated both Bax activation and cell death. Collectively the data indicate that saturated FFAs induce JNK-dependent hepatocyte lipoapoptosis by activating the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bim and Bax, which trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

Because a subset of patients with NAFLD progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and end stage liver disease (1Matteoni C.A. Younossi Z.M. Gramlich T. Boparai N. Liu Y.C. McCullough A.J. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 1413-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar), NAFLD has emerged as a substantial public health concern. This syndrome is associated with hepatocyte steatosis and elevated serum free fatty acids (2Feldstein A.E. Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. J. Hepatol. 2003; 39: 978-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, the cellular mechanisms linking elevated serum free fatty acids and hepatocyte steatosis to tissue injury remain obscure. Liver cell apoptosis is a prominent feature of NASH and correlates with disease severity (3Feldstein A.E. Canbay A. Angulo P. Taniai M. Burgart L.J. Lindor K.D. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The toxicity of lipids, or lipotoxicity, and specifically lipid-induced apoptosis, or lipoapoptosis, is a potential mechanism relating apoptosis to NASH. In support of this concept, FFAs have been reported to cause cellular steatosis and enhance expression of the apoptosis effectors tumor necrosis factor-α and Fas (2Feldstein A.E. Canbay A.

Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Rydzewski R. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence for hepatocyte lipoapoptosis by individual FFAs is lacking as is the potential mechanism by which they may engage the cellular apoptotic machinery. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated by various stress signals and interestingly also in obesity (5Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Gorgun C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar, 6Liu W. Schoenkerman A. Lowe Jr., W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E782-E790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The JNK pathway contributes to stress-induced apoptosis in several cell types, including pancreatic β-cells, neurons, and hepatocytes (7Ammendrup A. Maillard A. Nielsen K. Aabenhus Andersen N.

Dent P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3052-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interactions between FFAs and JNK signaling may, therefore, be a potential link between obesity and lipoapoptosis. JNK has three isoforms of which only two are expressed in the liver, JNK1 and JNK2 (10Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3612) Google Scholar). Sustained JNK2 and JNK3 activation are cytotoxic in neurons (11Keramaris E. Vanderluit J.L. Bahadori M. Mousavi K. Davis R.J. Flavell R. Slack R.S. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1132-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas JNK1 potentiates hepatocyte apoptosis by the toxic bile acid deoxycholate (9Qiao L. Han S.I. Fang Y. Park J.S. Gupta S. Gilfor D. Amorino G. Valerie K. Sealy L. Engelhardt J.F. Grant S. Hylemon P.B. Dent P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3052-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, JNK isoform cytotoxicity appears to be cell type- and stimulus-specific. JNK may induce cell injury through both transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms. Growth factor withdrawal-, UV light-, and oxidative stress-associated JNK-mediated apoptosis requires activation of the transcription factor c-Jun/AP-1 (12Hochedlinger K. Wagner E.F. Sabapathy K.

Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, JNK may also induce apoptosis in a transcription-independent process by activating proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bim and Bax, or inactivating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, antiapoptotic members of this family (16Aoki H.

Activation of the proapoptotic proteins or inhibition of their antiapoptotic counterparts triggers mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. The dual objectives of this study were to determine whether individual free fatty acids induce hepatocyte apoptosis and whether the observed lipoapoptosis is JNK-dependent. We induced steatosis in cultured hepatocytes and demonstrated apoptotic cell death with free fatty acid treatment. Sustained JNK activation was a prominent feature of this lipoapoptosis, and inhibition of JNK abrogated hepatocyte lipotoxicity. Cells—Mouse hepatocytes were isolated from C57/Bl6 wild type, JNK1-/-, JNK2-/- (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), and cathepsin B-/- mice (21Guicciardi M.E. Deussing J. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Svingen P.A. Peters C. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) by collagenase perfusion (22Faubion W.A. Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Roberts P.J. Svingen P.A. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). After Percoll purification hepatocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose (25 mm), 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. HepG2, a well differentiated human hepatoblastoma cell line frequently used for studies of lipid metabolism (23Dashti N. Wolfbauer G. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 423-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Huh7, a human hepatoma cell line, and MRH 7777, a rat hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, were also cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. Fatty Acid Treatment—Oleic acid (catalog number O 1008), palmitoleic acid (catalog number P 9417), palmitic acid (catalog number P 0500), and stearic acid (catalog number S 4751) were all obtained from Sigma. Palmitic acid and stearic acid were dissolved in isopropanol at a concentration of 20 or 40 mm. Oleic acid and palmitoleic acid, commercially available in liquid form, were diluted in isopropanol to obtain 20 and 40 mm stock solutions. The concentration of the vehicle, isopropanol, was 1% in final incubations. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin was used in all experiments. The concentration of fatty acids used ranged from 50 to 400 μm. Fat Quantitation by Nile Red—Free fatty acid-treated cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Intracellular neutral lipid was stained with Nile Red (0.2 mg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature (24Greenspan P. Mayer E.P. Fowler S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Images were acquired by confocal microscopy with an inverted Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NJ). Cellular fluorescence was quantitated using Zeiss KS400 image analysis software (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Oberkochen, Germany). Nile Red staining, reflecting lipid content, was expressed as an increase in total cellular fluorescence intensity per cell (pixels above threshold × fluorescence intensity). Quantitation of Apoptosis—Nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and fluorescence microscopy were used to quantitate apoptotic cells. 400 random cells were counted in each condition. Cells with the characteristic nuclear changes of chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were considered apoptotic. Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin-EDTA, 10 min, 37 °C) and fixed by resuspension in ice-cold 70% ethanol. After washing once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), low molecular mass DNA fragments were extracted by rinsing fixed cells in extraction buffer (0.2 m Na2HPO4, 0.1 m citric acid, pH 7.8). Cellular DNA was stained with propidium iodide (20 μg/ml) in the presence of DNase-free RNase A (200 μg/ml) (25Gong J. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric data were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems). Quantitation of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψ)—Cells were cultured on 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). Δψ was measured using a fluorescence unquenching assay based on the concept of resonance energy transfer (26Ribeiro A. Bronk S.F. Roberts P.J. Urrutia R. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1490-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The normal negative mitochondrial membrane potential results in selective uptake of the cationic MitoFluor green, which covalently binds mitochondrial proteins. On loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, MitoFluor green is still retained within mitochondria; tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), also a fluorescent cation, loads into mitochondria based on Δψ but rapidly diffuses out of mitochondria upon mitochondrial depolarization. MitoFluor green fluorescence emission at fluorescein wavelengths is effectively quenched by TMRM via resonance energy transfer in fully polarized mitochondria. However, as Δψ is lost, TMRM diffuses out of mitochondria resulting in enhanced MitoFluor green fluorescence. Cells were treated with free fatty acid for 24 h prior to loading with 200 nm MitoFluor green for 20 min at 37 °C in medium. Then the cells were loaded with 1 μm TMRM for 20 min at 37 °C. After initial fluorescence measurement (Y), the nonfluorescent uncoupler 1799 (50 nm) was added. This uncoupler results in mitochondrial depolarization and loss of TMRM allowing determination of maximal MitoFluor green fluorescence (X) from depolarized mitochondria. Change in fluorescence (X - Y) was calculated for control (XC - YC) and treated (XT - YT) cells and expressed as a percent change of control (XT - YT/XC - YC × 100). By this assay percent decrease in florescence intensity correlates with loss of Δψ. Fluorescence was recorded using an inverted fluorescence microscope, and images were collated using a cooled, charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and digitized by MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging, Westchester, PA). Immunocytochemistry—Cells on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Permeabilization was performed with 0.0125% CHAPS in PBS, 0.05% saponin in PBS, and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for Bax, cytochrome c, and NF-κB immunostaining, respectively. Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-NF-κB RelA/p65 (1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-universal Bax (1:50-1:100 dilution, Exalpha Biologicals, Watertown, MA), and mouse anti-cytochrome c (1:200 dilution, BD Pharmingen). Secondary antibodies were TMRM-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (4 μg/ml), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse (4 μg/ml) antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000, Jackson Immunological Research Laboratories, Inc.) ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes) was used as mounting medium. Images were acquired by confocal microscopy with an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Carl Zeiss Inc.). Cell Fractions—Whole cell, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions were prepared from HepG2 cells ∼70% confluent prior to treatment with free fatty acids. To prepare whole cell lysates, cells were placed on ice, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then scraped in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Diagnostics), transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. For subcellular fractions, cultured cells were collected by scraping in homogenization buffer (70 mm sucrose, 220 mm mannitol, 3 mm EDTA, 5mm MOPS, pH 7.4) and transferred to an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer. After 100 up and down passes in the homogenizer (on ice), the crude homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet mitochondria from cytosol. The supernatant from this step is the cytosolic fraction, and the pellet is the mitochondrial fraction. The mitochondrial pellet was rinsed in wash buffer (5 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4), collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Diagnostics). After incubating for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking, the mitochondrial lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble protein. The protein content of samples was estimated by the Bradford assay (Sigma). The mitochondrial, cytosolic, and whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described below. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein was electrophoretically resolved by SDS-PAGE and immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. 5% nonfat dairy milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) with 0.1% Tween 20 was used to block nonspecific binding sites. Primary antibodies were: JNK, phospho-JNK, c-Jun, phospho-c-Jun, p38 MAPK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); phospho-p38 (1:2000), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (1:2500, Promega Corp., Madison, WI); Bid (1:1000, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), cytochrome c (1:500, BD Pharmingen); Bax, Bak (1:500), and cytochrome c oxidase II (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Bim (1:1000, Chemicon, Temecula, CA); and Bim (1:1000, BD Pharmingen). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000, BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) were used to detect antigen-antibody complexes. Immune complexes were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunoreactive areas were quantitated by densitometry using an imaging densitometer (Model GS-700, Bio-Rad) and the Molecular Analyst software program (Bio-Rad) to calculate the ratio of Bim-EL to γ-tubulin. Caspase 3/7 Activity—Cells were plated in 96-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Caspase activity assay was performed using the commercially available Apo-ONE homogeneous caspase 3/7 assay (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly this assay involves cleavage of a profluorescent caspase 3/7 consensus substrate, bis-(N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-aspartic acid amide) conjugated to rhodamine 110 (Z-DEVD-R110) on its carboxyl-terminal side. Proteolytic cleavage liberates rhodamine 110, unquenching its fluorescence. Fluorescence was measured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 498 and 521 nm, respectively. JNK and Phospho-JNK Immunoreactivity by ELISA—JNK and phospho-JNK immunoreactivity was measured using a commercially available Fast Activated Cell-based ELISA (FACE; Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly cells were plated in 96-well plates. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde followed by quenching of endogenous peroxidase with 1% H2O2 and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Each well was incubated with antibody specific to total JNK or phospho-JNK. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was subsequently added and developed with the commercial reagent. Absorption was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer. Cell number was quantitated by crystal violet staining. JNK and phospho-JNK immunoreactivity was normalized to cell number. Bim Gene Silencing by siRNA—RNA interference was used to silence Bim gene expression in Huh7 and HepG2 cells. A 21-nucleotide doublestranded siRNA, 5′-AAT TAC CAA GCA GCC GAA GAC-3′, targeting human Bim was designed using proprietary software and synthesized using a Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Transient gene silencing was attained by transfection of siRNA into cells using siPORT lipid transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Scrambled siRNA was used as a control. Gene silencing was verified by detecting protein with immunoblot analysis after transient transfection of Huh7 cells with siRNA. Briefly cells grown in 6-well dishes were transiently transfected with 35 nm siRNA using 4 μl/ml siPORT lipid (Ambion Inc.) in a total transfection volume of 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h, 1 ml of normal growth medium was added. Transfected cells were then analyzed for apoptosis, for Bax activation by immunofluorescence, or by immunoblot as described elsewhere under “Experimental Procedures.” Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Maloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers (Invitrogen) were used to reverse transcribe RNA into cDNA. The cDNA template was quantified using real time PCR (LightCycler, Roche Applied Science) using SYBR green (Molecular Probes) as fluorophore. The PCR primers for Bim were forward 5′-AGATCCCCGCTTTTCATCTT-3′ and reverse 5′-AGGACTTGGGGTTTGTGTTG-3′; the primers for human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 were forward 5′-CTACAAGGCGGTGAAGGAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGGAGTGCTGAGTAGGTGGA-3′; the primers for murine CYP2E1 were forward 5′-TTCATCAACCTCGTCCCTTC-3′ and reverse 5′-AGGCCTTCTCCAACACACAC-3′. Commercially available 18 S rRNA primers (Ambion Inc.) were used as internal control. The expected PCR product was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel and eluted into Tris·HCl using a DNA elution kit (gel extraction kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The concentration of DNA in the extracted PCR product was measured (copies/μl) spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. A standard curve was generated using the extracted PCR product. The inverse linear relationship between copy and cycle numbers was then determined. Each resulting standard curve was then used to calculate the copy number per microliter in each experimental sample. The target mRNA level was expressed relative to the 18 S rRNA level for each sample. The PCR conditions and primers were optimized to produce a single PCR product of the correct base pair size. Reagents—TMRM, MitoFluor, and MitoTracker green were from Molecular Probes. Nile Red, DAPI, Percoll, stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and palmitoleic acid were from Sigma. Z-VAD-fmk was from Enzyme Systems (Livermore, CA). Mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors U0126, PD98059, and SP600125 and JNK peptide inhibitor were from Calbiochem. Caspase inhibitor IDN-6556 was from IDUN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Differences between groups were compared using Student's t test. FFA Treatment Induces Cellular Steatosis—We first confirmed our cell culture model of cellular steatosis by incubating HepG2 cells with various FFAs in medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Specifically HepG2 cells were incubated with oleic acid (C18:1) and palmitoleic acid (C16:1), both monounsaturated fatty acids, and stearic acid (C18:0) and palmitic acid (C16:0), both saturated fatty acids, for 18 h. Intracellular lipid vacuoles visible under phase-contrast microscopy were confirmed by Nile Red staining (Fig. 1A). To confirm equal steatotic effects of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, cellular steatosis, expressed as a percentage of total cellular area, was quantified (Fig. 1B). Percent steatosis was 9.5 ± 2.6% in oleic acid-treated cells, 14.7 ± 1.9% in palmitic acid-treated cells, 10.1 ± 0.5% in palmitoleic acid-treated cells, 12.4 ± 1.8% in stearic acid-treated cells, and 3.7 ± 0.4% in untreated controls. Thus, all the individual FFAs produced similar cellular steatosis. CYP2E1 expression is associated with human NASH (27Weltman M.D. Farrell G.C. Hall P. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Liddle C. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). CYP2E1 expression in palmitic acid-treated Huh7 cells was modestly increased (∼2-fold) (data not shown). In contrast, free fatty acid treatment did not result in enhanced CYP2E1 expression in primary murine hepatocytes or HepG2 cells (data not shown). Thus, our reductionistic model recapitulates cellular steatosis, a cardinal feature of human NASH, and other features of human NASH albeit in a cell-specific manner. FFAs Induce Lipoapoptosis—FFA cytotoxicity was time- and concentration-dependent (Fig. 2, A and B). In HepG2 cells treated for 24 h with 200 μm FFA (Fig. 2C), stearic acid toxicity was 64.5 ± 3%, and palmitic acid toxicity was 41.8 ± 2.6%, whereas only modest oleic acid and palmitoleic acid toxicity was observed (12.2 ± 2.1 and 11.5 ± 1.2%, respectively). Similar results were observed in Huh7 cells (data not shown), MRH 7777 cells, and primary mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 2D). Thus, saturated fatty acids, palmitic and stearic, were more toxic than monounsaturated fatty acids, oleic and palmitoleic, in primary hepatocytes and all hepatoma cell lines examined. Biochemical confirmation of apoptosis was obtained by demonstrating DNA cleavage and caspase activation, both biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis (28Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis demonstrated 15.6 ± 1.1% death in control cells; this was increased to 19.8 ± 1.3% (p = 0.04) with oleic acid treatment and 58 ± 2.7% (p < 0.001) with palmitic acid treatment for 24 h. Fatty acid treatment also led to robust caspase 3/7 activation (Fig. 2E). Consistent with the morphologic assessment of apoptosis, caspase 3/7 activity was greater in palmitic acid-(7.1-fold) and stearic acid (6.5-fold)-treated HepG2 cells as compared with oleic acid-treated cells (2.6-fold). The pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk attenuated cell death by all FFAs examined in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2F). The structurally dissimilar pancaspase inhibitor IDN-6556 also reduced cell death by 50% in HepG2 cells incubated with palmitic acid or stearic acid (p < 0.01, data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that FFAs induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. FFA-mediated Apoptosis Occurs via the Mitochondrial Pathway of Apoptosis—Mitochondrial dysfunction with loss of Δψ and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol are prominent features of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Indeed Δψ was 26 ± 14% of the initial value following treatment with palmitic acid and 25 ± 11% of the initial value following treatment with stearic acid for 18 h. Upon treatment with fatty acids, cytochrome c was also released from mitochondria into the cytosol as demonstrated by a change from punctate to diffuse cytoplasmic staining in 19% of oleic acid-treated HepG2 cells, 98% of palmitic acid-treated cells, and 96% of stearic acid-treated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Release of cytochrome c into the cytosol by palmitic acid and stearic acid was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that saturated FFAs mediate apoptosis by engaging the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatocytes may be initiated via either death receptor (extrinsic) or"
https://openalex.org/W2122564376,"To date there is no accepted clinical diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease (PD) based on biochemical analysis of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn) protein has been linked to the pathogenesis of PD with the discovery of mutations in the gene encoding alpha-syn in familial cases with early-onset PD. Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which constitute the main pathological features in the brains of patients with sporadic PD and dementia with Lewy bodies, are formed by the conversion of soluble monomers of alpha-syn into insoluble aggregates. We recently reported the presence of alpha-syn in normal human blood plasma and in postmortem CSF. Here, we investigated whether alpha-syn can be used as a biomarker for PD. We have developed a novel ELISA method that detects only oligomeric ""soluble aggregates"" of alpha-syn. Using this ELISA, we report the presence of significantly elevated (P=0.002) levels of oligomeric forms of alpha-syn in plasma samples obtained from 34 PD patients compared with 27 controls; 52% (95% confidence intervals 0.353-0.687) of the PD patients displayed signals >0.5 OD with our ELISA assay in comparison to only 14.8% (95% confidence intervals 0.014-0.281) for the control cases. An analysis of the test's diagnostic value revealed a specificity of 0.852 (95% confidence intervals 0.662-0.958), sensitivity of 0.529 (95% confidence intervals 0.351-0.702) and a positive predictive value of 0.818 (95% confidence intervals 0.597-0.948). These observations offer new opportunities for developing diagnostic tests for PD and related diseases and for testing therapeutic agents aimed at preventing or reversing the aggregation of alpha-syn."
https://openalex.org/W2160118258,"Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) is a key enzyme in the trans-sulfuration pathway, which uses L-cysteine to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The CSE/H2S system has been shown to play an important role in regulating cellular functions in different systems. In the present study, we overexpressed CSE in human aorta smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) using a recombinant defective adenovirus containing CSE gene (Ad-CSE). Infection of HASMCs with Ad-CSE resulted in a significant increase in the expression of CSE protein and H2S production. Ad-CSE transfection inhibited cell growth and stimulated apoptosis, as evidenced by cell viability assay, Hoechst 33258 staining, TUNEL, and caspase 3 activation. CSE-mediated apoptosis was associated with an increased ERK and p38 MAPK activation, up-regulation of p21(Cip/WAK-1), and down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression. After inhibiting endogenous background CSE gene expression, direct administration of H2S at 100 microM induced apoptosis of HASMCs. The other two endproducts of CSE-catalyzed enzymatic reaction, ammonium and pyruvate, failed to do so. These results demonstrate that overexpression of CSE stimulates SMC apoptosis due to an increased endogenous production of H2S. Adenovirus-mediated transfer of CSE gene may provide a novel therapeutic approach in treating vascular diseases linked to abnormal cellular proliferation and vascular remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2057523896,"Human Eg5, responsible for the formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle, has been identified recently as one of the targets of S-trityl-l-cysteine, a potent tumor growth inhibitor in the NCI 60 tumor cell line screen. Here we show that in cell-based assays S-trityl-l-cysteine does not prevent cell cycle progression at the S or G2 phases but inhibits both separation of the duplicated centrosomes and bipolar spindle formation, thereby blocking cells specifically in the M phase of the cell cycle with monoastral spindles. Following removal of S-trityl-l-cysteine, mitotically arrested cells exit mitosis normally. In vitro, S-trityl-l-cysteine targets the catalytic domain of Eg5 and inhibits Eg5 basal and microtubule-activated ATPase activity as well as mant-ADP release. S-Trityl-l-cysteine is a tight binding inhibitor (estimation of Ki,app <150 nm at 300 mm NaCl and 600 nm at 25 mm KCl). S-Trityl-l-cysteine binds more tightly than monastrol because it has both an ∼8-fold faster association rate and ∼4-fold slower release rate (6.1 μM–1 s–1 and 3.6 s–1 for S-trityl-l-cysteine versus 0.78 μM–1 s–1 and 15 s–1 for monastrol). S-Trityl-l-cysteine inhibits Eg5-driven microtubule sliding velocity in a reversible fashion with an IC50 of 500 nm. The S and d-enantiomers of S-tritylcysteine are nearly equally potent, indicating that there is no significant stereospecificity. Among nine different human kinesins tested, S-trityl-l-cysteine is specific for Eg5. The results presented here together with the proven effect on human tumor cell line growth make S-trityl-l-cysteine a very attractive starting point for the development of more potent mitotic inhibitors.

Kinesins form a superfamily of motor proteins with about 14 different subfamilies clearly identified so far. They play important roles in intracellular transport and at different stages of cell division. The driving force behind these processes is ATP hydrolysis.The roles of different kinesins during cell division make them highly important for understanding fundamental aspects of mitosis and meiosis. In recent years, some of them have appeared as potential targets for anti-cancer drugs (1Wood K.W. Cornwell W.D. Jackson J.R. Curr. Opin.

Cell-based as well as in vitro assays have led to the discovery of a series of inhibitors that target Eg5 and lead to mitotic arrest and cell death. Among these inhibitors are monastrol, the first Eg5 inhibitor discovered (7Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggarty S.J. King R.W. Schreiber S.L. Mitchison T.J.

Several of these inhibitors are currently intensively studied as potential anticancer drugs, as tools for studying fundamental processes in mitosis and function of its target (chemical genetics) (13Canman J.C.

Skoufias D. Robin G. Lebeau L. Lopez R. Margolis R. Wade R.H. Kozielski F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1079-1090PubMed Google Scholar). STLC was shown to effectively inhibit the in vitro Eg5 basal and MT-stimulated ATPase activities (IC50 = 1 μm and IC50 = 140 nm, respectively) each at a given protein concentration and to induce mitotic arrest in HeLa cells in the sub-micromolar range (IC50 = 0.7 μm), without visible effects on the MT network, even at high inhibitor concentration. Additionally, we were able to show that STLC and monastrol share a common binding region on Eg5 (18Brier S. Lemaire D. DeBonis S. Forest E. Kozielski F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13072-13082Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). STLC has been identified by computer-assisted analysis of cytotoxicity data as a mitotic arrest agent (19Paull K.D. Lin C.M. Malspeis L. Hamel E. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3892-3900PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in the NCI 60 tumor cell line screen, making it a potentially very interesting candidate for drug development.To better understand its inhibition mechanism, we studied the effect of STLC in HeLa and U2OS cells and in vitro by using the recombinantly expressed Eg5 motor domain comprising the first 386 N-terminal residues of the native protein. We describe here the characterization of the interaction of STLC with human Eg5, its mode of inhibition, effects on HeLa cells, and the characteristics of both enantiomers. These results provide a basis for understanding the inhibition mechanism of a molecular motor and for the development of more potent inhibitors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Fetal bovine serum was bought from Hyclone. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Invitrogen. Nocodazole, taxol, and aphidicholine were from Sigma, and STLC was from Novabiochem. 96-Well half-area and 96-well μclear plates were from Greiner BioOne. The anti-γ-tubulin antibody was obtained from Sigma. FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies were bought from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA. The MPM-2 mouse monoclonal antibody was from Dako, Carpinteria, CA. Mant-ADP was purchased from Jena Biosciences, Germany. The chiral chirobiotic T column was from Advanced Separation Technologies Inc., Whippany, NJ.S-Tritylcysteine Compounds—Stock solutions of STLC (NSC 83265) and S-trityl-d-cysteine (STDC, NSC 124676) were prepared at 50 mm in Me2SO and kept at –20 °C. The purity of all compounds used in this study was checked by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. To better judge the small differences observed between STLC and STDC by using the in vitro and cell-based assays, we compared the wavelength scans of both solutions (2 μl of each enantiomer stock solution in 98 μl of ethanol) and found that their concentrations were practically identical with a maximal error of ±4.6%. The enantiomeric purity of STLC and STDC was checked by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a chiral chirobiotic T column (250 × 4.6 mm) using a mixture of acetonitrile/water (85:15 v/v; flow rate, 1 ml/min). The wavelength for the detection of S-trityl compounds was 235 nm. STLC from either NCI or Novabiochem was eluted at tR 10.9 min, whereas STDC was eluted at tR 13.5 min. Both STLC and STDC used in this study were judged to be at least 97% enantiomerically pure. In addition STLC obtained from the NCI seemed to be enantiomerically slightly more pure than the compound purchased from Novabiochem (supplemental Fig. 1).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Homo sapiens kinesins containing the catalytic domain were purified as follows: Eg5 (construct HsEg52–386 with bound ADP as well as nucleotide-free and XlEg51–430), uKHC (a member of the kinesin-1 family), MKLP1 and RabK6 (kinesin-6), KIFC1 (kinesin-14), CENP-E (kinesin-7), KIF2A and KIF2C (kinesin-13), and Kid (kinesin-10) were prepared as described 3S.

Williams J.R. Lee J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The polymerization assays of tubulin (at 40 μm) in the presence and absence of STLC (50 μm) and two controls (40 μm taxol and 10 μm nocodazole) were performed in 96-well half-area plates in a volume of 100 μl at 37 °C (Sunrise photometer, TECAN, Maennesdorf, Switzerland). The buffer used for polymerization of tubulin was 100 mm PIPES, pH 6.75, 1 mm Na-EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.7 mm GTP. All concentrations indicated are final after mixing.Testing the Specificity of STLC Using Other Human Kinesins—The ATPase activity of kinesins was determined by using the enzyme-coupled assay described by Hackney and Jiang (24Hackney D.D. Jiang W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 164: 65-71PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of STLC was determined by measuring the inhibition of the basal or MT-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of increasing amounts of STLC using NaCl concentrations that had been optimized individually for each kinesin to maximize their activities.Testing STLC and STDC for Tight Binding—Measurements of inhibition of the basal Eg5 ATPase activity were performed as described by DeBonis et al. (12DeBonis S. Skoufias D. Robin G. Lebeau L. Lopez R. Margolis R. Wade R.H. Kozielski F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1079-1090PubMed Google Scholar). To optimize the signal for basal Eg5 activity at low protein concentration, measurements were performed in the presence of 300 mm NaCl. Eg5 at seven different concentrations (0.175, 0.35, 0.7, 1.4, 2.8, 3.5, and 4.2 μm) was incubated at room temperature for 25 min with STLC or STDC from 0 to 5 μm. The final Me2SO concentration in all cases was 2% in a final volume of 30 μl. The mixture containing Eg5 and STLC or STDC was rapidly mixed with 170 μl ATPase buffer previously dispensed into wells of a μclear 96-well plate, and the resulting decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was measured using the 96-well Sunrise photometer. The IC50 values for inhibition of basal Eg5 ATPase activity by increasing amounts of inhibitor were determined in triplicate. In a previous publication (12DeBonis S. Skoufias D. Robin G. Lebeau L. Lopez R. Margolis R. Wade R.H. Kozielski F. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1079-1090PubMed Google Scholar), we determined initial IC50 values for STLC by fitting the experimental data to Equation 1, v/v0=100−(A×([I]/([I]+IC50)(Eq. 1) where v is the reaction velocity at different STLC concentrations; v0 is the control velocity in the absence of inhibitor; A represents the amplitude; [I] indicates the concentration of STLC, and IC50 indicates the median inhibitory concentration. This led to a nonoptimal fit for tight binding STLC. The experimental data were best fitted now to the Morrison Equation 2 (25Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) for tight binding inhibitors, vi/v0=1−(([E]+[I]+Ki,app)−([E]+[I]+Ki,app)2−4[E][I])/2[E](Eq. 2) where v0 is the velocity in the absence of inhibitor; vi is the measured velocity; [E] is equal to the total enzyme concentration; [I] indicates the added inhibitor concentration, and Ki,app indicates the apparent equilibrium inhibition constant, which depend on the type of inhibition.Stopped-flow Analysis—Stopped-flow analysis of the fast phase of STLC binding to the complex of Eg5 with mant-ADP was performed as described previously for monastrol (14DeBonis S. Simorre J.P. Crevel I. Lebeau L. Skoufias D.A. Blangy A. Ebel C. Gans P. Cross R. Hackney D.D. Wade R.H. Kozielski F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed at high (300 mm NaCl) and low (25 mm KCl) salt concentrations. Excitation was at 285 nm. The data for the fast phase were fitted to Equation 3 at low STLC concentrations, kobs=k−1+k1[I](Eq. 3) where I represents the different STLC concentrations, and k1 and k–1 are the binding and release rate constants for Reaction 1, E·mant-ADP+I⇆E·mant-ADP·I(Eq. 4) and k1 and k–1 are the rate constants for binding and release of STLC.Motility Assays—STLC was resuspended at 50 μm in 100% Me2SO and subsequently diluted in Me2SO prior to addition to the motility buffer, to keep a constant 2% Me2SO concentration. Before loading in the chamber, Eg5 was diluted 3-fold to 5 μm using buffer A (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm Na-EGTA, 5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol), supplemented with 1 mm ATP and 0.1 mg/ml casein. The chamber was incubated 5 min at room temperature and then washed with buffer X containing 1 mm ATP. Finally, in vitro assembled pig brain MTs at 0.075 μm were injected in buffer X containing 1 mm ATP and 20 μm paclitaxel. Both the STLC inhibition and the Me2SO inhibition were confirmed to be fully reversible on washout.Cell Culture—HeLa and U2OS cells were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Stock solutions of 1 mg/ml nocodazole and 50 mm aphidicholine were prepared in Me2SO and kept at –20 °C until use.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were left to adhere for at least 36 h on poly-d-lysine-coated glass in 24-well plates before the addition of the drugs. Following incubation with drugs for 8 h, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde/PBS at 37 °C for 3 min, followed by an incubation in 100% methanol at –20 °C for 5 min and then washing with PBS for 5 min. After two additional 5-min washes, fixed cells were incubated with YL1/2 anti-α-tubulin and anti-γ-tubulin for 1 h and then with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 30 min and counterstained with propidium iodide. Images were collected with a, MRC-600 laser scanning confocal apparatus (Bio-Rad) coupled to a Nikon Optiphot microscope.Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells treated as above were collected and fixed in 90% methanol at –20 °C for at least 10 min, followed by three washes with PBS. Two-dimensional flow cytometric analysis was carried out using the MPM-2 mouse monoclonal antibody, a specific mitotic marker (26Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and propidium iodide, a marker of DNA content. Following incubation with MPM-2, cells were labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies and propidium iodide as described previously (27Andreassen P.R. Skoufias D.A. Margolis R.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 281: 213-225PubMed Google Scholar). Data were collected using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using Cellquest software, and only gated cells were taken into account.Live Cell Imaging and Video Microscopy—For time-lapse microscopy, HeLa cells were plated in glass-bottom dishes covered with a CO2-permeable membrane and then placed inside the video microscopy platform equipped with an incubator enabling the regulation of the temperature and the CO2 level. Time lapse Z series images (Z = 3) were collected with an inverted motorized microscope (Axiovert 200M, Zeiss) controlled by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Tubulin-GFP-marked cells were observed with a plane neofluar objective (63 × 1.4 NA), and fluorescent images were acquired with a CoolSnap HQ charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) every 5 min for 8 h for the control without inhibitor and up to a maximum of 38 h in presence of 5 or 10 μm STLC under low illumination to avoid cell damage. The acquisition time was 100 ms. For each Z series images, the best focus was chosen before the reconstitution of the movie.RESULTSComparison between STLC and STDC—STLC is a non-natural derivative of the α-amino acid cysteine (Fig. 1), which incorporates a single chiral center and consequently exists as two enantiomers (d and l). The enantiomeric purity of STLC and STDC was determined by HPLC on the chiral chirobiotic T column (supplemental Fig. 1). STLC from either the NCI (Fig. 1A) or Novabiochem (Fig. 1B) was eluted at tR 10.9 min, whereas STDC was eluted at tR 13.5 min (Fig. 1C). The difference in retention time between the two enantiomers was more evident when the two were mixed and then separated (Fig. 1D). The STLC and STDC used in this study were both judged to be at least 97% enantiomerically pure.To determine whether one of the enantiomers is more active than the other, we measured the inhibition of basal- and MT-activated ATPase activities using Eg5 concentrations of 0.7 and 0.073 μm, respectively, and quantified the number of monoastral spindles when incubating HeLa cells with STLC (Fig. 2). Both enantiomers inhibit the basal Eg5 ATPase activity with IC50 values of 403 nm for STLC and 611 nm for STDC (Fig. 2A), and the MT-activated ATPase activity with an IC50 of 286 ± 11 nm for STLC and 240 ± 28 nm for STDC (Fig. 2B). Phenotype-based assays with HeLa cells also showed that the two enantiomers are nearly equally potent (Fig. 2C). Within the first 8 h of incubation, both enantiomers gave a concentration-dependent accumulation of mitotic cells with MTs emanating from a single spindle aster (Fig. 2C, upper panels) with IC50 values of 700 and 750 nm for STLC and STDC, respectively (Fig. 2D). Immunofluorescence microscopy using a γ-tubulin antibody as a centrosomal marker revealed the two centrosomes (four γ-tubulin spots) had failed to separate in the center of the monoasters (Fig. 2C, lower panels). This monoaster phenotype has been described previously to result from inhibition of Eg5 activity either after injection of Eg5 antibodies (5Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) or after inhibition of Eg5 activity by specific inhibitors like monastrol (7Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggarty S.J.

Both enantiomers were also equally potent in inhibiting cell cycle progression at G2/M. Two-dimensional FACScan analysis (using propidium iodide for DNA content and the mitotic marker MPM2 antibody) revealed that addition of STLC and STDC in asynchronously cycling HeLa cells leads to the accumulation of cells, in a concentration-dependent manner, with a 4 n DNA content (Fig. 2, E and F). After 24 h of incubation with the drugs at concentrations equal to and above 5 μm, more than 80% of the cells are arrested in G2/M phase (Fig. 2G). Interestingly, after a 24-h incubation period and even at high concentrations the drugs do not appear to be cytotoxic. Furthermore, 80% of total cells were mitotic because they were positive for the mitotic marker MPM2 (Fig. 2H). These data suggest that STLC and STDC are potent mitotic inhibitors. Quantitatively similar mitotic arrest data were obtained with the U2OS tumor cell line (data not shown).FIG. 2Comparison of STLC and STDC.

FACScan analysis of treated cells revealed that when starting before 48 h there is accumulation of the sub-G1 population of cells, indicative of apoptotic cells, which is more prominent at 72 h. Although they block in mitosis after prolonged incubation with STLC, U2OS cells, in contrast to HeLa cells, experience adaptation and mitotic slippage and proceed to the next cell cycle. After 72 h, there is a peak of 8N cells suggesting that the cells were able to proceed to a second round of DNA replication (Fig. 3B). A sub-G1 population of U2OS cells was also apparent.FIG. 3STLC blocks cell cycle specifically in mitosis. HeLa cells (A) and U2OS (B) cells were analyzed by FACScan analysis following incubation with STLC (5 μm) at the indicated times. C, U2OS cells presynchronized with aphidicholine for 18 h at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. Following aphidicholine washout, cells were treated with 5μm STLC. Samples for FACScan analysis at the indicated times were collected. Cells reached G2/M phase 8 h following release from the G1/S block and remained blocked at G2/M for the next 24 h in the presence of STLC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)STLC as a Specific Inhibitor of Mitotic Progression—We were also interested to know if STLC was able to block cells in a different phase of the cell cycle. U2OS cells were exposed to STLC, following presynchronization with aphidicholine at early G1/S before centrosome duplication (Fig. 3C). U2OS cells, 8 h following aphidicholine release in the presence of STLC, passed through the S phase and arrived at G2/M synchronously where they remained blocked for the next 24 h. Identical behavior was obtained with the MT assembly inhibitor nocodazole (data not shown). These results suggest that STLC does not inhibit cell cycle progression at S or G2 phases and that indeed is a specific inhibitor of mitotic progression.Reversibility of STLC—We also examined whether the inhibition of Eg5 activity by STLC in mitotically arrested cel"
https://openalex.org/W2039533506,"P110delta phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) plays a pivotal role in the recruitment and activation of certain inflammatory cells. Recent findings revealed that the activity of p110delta also contributes to allergen-IgE-induced mast cell activation and vascular permeability. We investigated the role of p110delta in allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness using IC87114, a selective p110delta inhibitor, in a mouse asthma model. BALB/c mice were sensitized with OVA and, upon OVA aerosol challenge, developed airway eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion, elevation in cytokine and chemokine levels, up-regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Intratracheal administration of IC87114 significantly (P<0.05) attenuated OVA-induced influx into lungs of total leukocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, as well as levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and RANTES in a dose-dependent manner. IC87114 also significantly (P<0.05) reduced the serum levels of total IgE and OVA-specific IgE and LTC(4) release into the airspace. Histological studies show that IC87114 inhibited OVA-induced lung tissue eosinophilia, airway mucus production, and inflammation score. In addition, IC87114 significantly (P<0.05) suppressed OVA-induced airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine. Western blot analyses of whole lung tissue lysates shows that IC87114 markedly attenuated the OVA-induced increase in expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, RANTES, and eotaxin. Furthermore, IC87114 treatment markedly attenuated OVA-induced serine phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream effector of PI3K signaling. Taken together, our findings implicate that inhibition of p110delta signaling pathway may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic airway inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2025512024,"The NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) family of transcription factors plays a fundamental role in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response. However, NFATs are ubiquitously expressed, and recent evidence points to their important functions in human epithelial cells and carcinomas. Specifically, NFAT has been shown to be active in human breast and colon carcinoma cells and to promote their invasion through Matrigel. The mechanisms by which NFAT promotes invasion have not been defined. To identify NFAT target genes that induce carcinoma invasion, we have established stable breast cancer cell lines that inducibly express transcriptionally active NFAT. Gene expression profiling by cDNA microarray of cells induced to express NFAT revealed up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Increased NFAT expression and activity induced COX-2 expression as well as prostaglandin E2 synthesis. This induction was more prominent when NFAT was activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore ionomycin and was blocked by the NFAT antagonist cyclosporin A. Breast cancer cells with elevated COX-2 expression showed increased invasion through Matrigel, and this was reduced in cells treated with COX-2 inhibitors. Conversely, loss of NFAT1 protein expression using small interfering RNA led to a reduction in COX-2 transcription and reduced invasion. Similarly, Matrigel invasion was reduced in cells in which COX-2 expression was reduced using specific siRNA.

However, subsequent studies have revealed that NFAT is also expressed and is active in many other cell types and tissues, and it regulates the expression of genes related to cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and cell differentiation (4Caetano M.S.

The NFAT family of transcription factors comprises four classical members: NFAT1, NFAT2, NFAT3, and NFAT4 (2Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). All are calcium-responsive and are regulated by the calcium/calcineurin signaling pathway (9Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 10Feske S. Okamura H. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1117-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A recently identified member, NFAT5, is distinct from NFAT1–4 as it is calcium-insensitive and is regulated by osmotic stress and integrins (11Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Thomas S. Disteche C. Jenkins N.A. Rao A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NFATs are phosphorylated at a cluster of serine residues located in the regulatory domain, effectively masking a nuclear localization signal, thereby retaining NFAT in an inactive conformation in the cytoplasm (2Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 12Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J.

Upon stimulation with agonists that elicit an increase in intracellular calcium, NFATs are dephosphorylated by the phosphatase calcineurin and translocate to the nucleus. Here they are transcriptionally active by binding to the promoter regions of target genes (13Shaw K.T. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

When the cells return to their unstimulated state, NFAT becomes rephosphorylated and is exported out of the nucleus (2Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). Classical NFATs typically interact with other transcription factors such as AP-1 (15Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z.

Cyclooxygenases convert arachidonic acid produced from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). Prostaglandin endoperoxide is then converted to biologically active prostaglandins (PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α), prostacyclin (PGI2), and thromboxanes (TxA2) by tissue-specific synthases or reductases (20Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. DeWitt D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Following their synthesis, these prostanoids are secreted and bind to G protein-coupled membrane receptors in target cells in an autocrine or paracrine fashion, thereby triggering downstream signaling events (21Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar). Prostaglandins are important regulators of numerous cellular processes including cell proliferation, inflammation, and angiogenesis (22Hla T. Ristimaki A. Appleby S. Barriocanal J.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase-2 catalyzes the formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). COX-2 is distinct from the other isoform, COX-1, which is considered a housekeeping enzyme and is expressed constitutively in most tissues. Conversely, COX-2 is normally expressed at very low or undetectable levels and is rapidly induced at sites of inflammation and proliferation in response to stimuli such as growth factors and tumor promoters (23Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). COX-2 expression and PGE2 levels are elevated in a variety of human cancers (24Fujita T.

Several epidemiological studies have indicated that continuous users of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit COX activity, have reduced risk or mortality from cancer (33Rosenberg L.

Moreover, COX-2-specific inhibitors have been shown to suppress tumor growth in animal models of human cancer (36Kawamori T. Rao C.V. Seibert K. Reddy B.S.

A link between NFAT activity and COX-2 is evident from previous studies. NFAT has been reported to regulate COX-2 expression in human T lymphocytes (19Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Putative NFAT recognition sequences are present in the human COX-2 proximal promoter, and deletion analysis has shown that they are important for its transcriptional activation (19Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A recent study also demonstrated that these sites are essential for the induction of COX-2 by NFAT in colon carcinoma cells (38Duque J. Fresno M. Iniguez M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8686-8693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The consequence of NFAT-mediated COX-2 induction for cancer cell phenotypes has not been established. The significance of NFAT for cancer development or progression to metastasis has to date not been investigated. Our previous studies on NFAT revealed that it plays an essential role in promoting migration and invasion of breast and colon carcinoma cells (39Jauliac S. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Shaw L.M. Brown L.F. Rao A. Toker A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To identify the downstream NFAT target genes that are important for invasion, we have analyzed the gene expression profile of breast cancer cells that express NFAT1. We detected a significant up-regulation of COX-2 in these cells. We show that activation of NFAT increases COX-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis. Inactivation of NFAT by cyclosporin A (CsA) or siRNA significantly diminished COX-2 expression. Expression of COX-2 promoted invasion through Matrigel, and this was reduced by the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 or with siRNA. Together, these results provide the first direct evidence that NFAT promotes breast cancer cell invasion through the induction of COX-2. Cell Lines and Reagents—The human cell lines MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 g/ml glucose, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Nova-Tech, Grand Island, NE). The estrogen-independent breast cancer cell line SUM-159-PT has been described (40Flanagan L. Van Weelden K. Ammerman C. Ethier S.P. Welsh J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 58: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and was maintained in Ham's F-12 medium with l-glutamine (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma). SUM.N1-16 and 435.N1-23 cells with inducible NFAT1 expression were derived from SUM-159-PT and MDA-MB-435 cells, respectively, and generated using the tetracycline-regulated expression system from Invitrogen. HA-tagged NFAT1 was subcloned into pcDNA4/TO/Myc-His and was co-transfected into SUM-159-PT cells with pcDNA6/TR. Positive clones were selected and maintained in medium with 20 μg/ml blasticidin and 0.1 mg/ml zeocin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). 435.N1-23 cells were prepared by transfecting HA-NFAT1 in pcDNA4/TO/Myc-His into MDA-MB-435 cells that have constitutive expression of tetracycline repressors from pcDNA6/TR. Positive clones were selected and maintained in culture medium containing 10 μg/ml blasticidin and 0.4 mg/ml zeocin. Expression of NFAT1 was induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Clontech) for 16–24 h at 37 °C. SUM.N1 siRNA-4 and SUM.N1 siRNA-17 cells that express NFAT1 siRNA were prepared by transfecting SUM-159-PT cells with NFAT1 siRNA (see below). Stable clones were selected with 20 μg/ml blasticidin and 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Cells were treated with PMA (100 nm; Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) and ionomycin (100 nm; CalBiochem) for 16–24 h. Cyclosporin A (CalBiochem) was used at 10 μm and NS-398 (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) at 50–100 μm. Anti-HA antibody was purified in-house from the 12CA5 hybridoma. Monoclonal anti-COX-2 was from Cayman Chemical Co., and anti-NFAT1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin antibody was from Sigma. Plasmid Constructs—HA-NFAT1 was prepared by cloning HA-tagged murine NFAT1 cDNA into pcDNA4/TO/Myc-His (Invitrogen). The pIL2-Luc luciferase reporter plasmid has been described (41Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The pCS2-(n)-β-gal plasmid was from Promega (Madison, WI). The pCMV-COX-2 expression plasmid and the COX-2 promoter luciferase reporter P2-274 have been described (19Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and were provided by Dr. Miguel Iñiguez. COX-2 siRNA was generated by cloning the annealed oligonucleotides with sequences 5′-GAT CCC CAA CCG AGG TGT ATG TAT GAG TGT TTC AAG AGA ACA CTC ATA CAT ACA CCT CGG TTT TTT TGG AAA-3′ and 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA ACC GAG GTG TAT GTA TGA GTG TTC TCT TGA AAC ACT CAT ACA TAC ACC TCG GTT GGG-3′ into the BglII/HindIII sites of the pSUPER vector (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA). To silence NFAT1 expression, SUM.N1 siRNA-4 and SUM.N1 siRNA-17 cells were generated with the siRNA plasmid constructed with the following sequences: 5′-GAT CCC CTC CTT AAG CCG CAC GCC TTT TCA AGA GAA AGG CGT GCG GCT TAA GGA TTT TTG GAA A-3′ and 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAT CCT TAA GCC GCA CGC CTT TCT CTT GAA AAG GCG TGC GGC TTA AGG AGG G-3′. Immunoblotting—Total cell lysates were prepared in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Protein lysates were denatured, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The protein blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Signals were developed by using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate from Pierce. Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA samples were extracted from the cultured cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and were reverse transcribed into cDNA using Taqman reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)16 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR master mix in an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (both from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The reactions were carried out with a polymerase-activating step of 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of a two-step cycling program (95 °C for 15 s; 60 °C for 1 min) for NFAT1 detection or a three-step cycling program (95 °C for 15 s; 57 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s) for analyzing COX-2 transcription. For murine NFAT1, the primers were 5′-CGG AGT CCA AGG TTG TGT TCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGT GGC TGA CTT CGT TTC CTC-3′ (antisense). For human NFAT1, the primers were 5′-TGC ATC TAA CCC CAT CGA GTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGA GGA TCA TTT GCT GGC C-3′ (antisense). For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the primers were 5′-GCA AAT TCC ATG GCA CCG T-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCG CCC CAC TTG ATT TTG G-3′ (antisense). For COX-2, the primers were 5′-CAA AAG CTG GGA AGC CTT CTC TAA CC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCC CAG CCC GTT GGT GAA AG-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were analyzed on 1 or 1.5% agarose gels to ensure the specificity of amplification. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—All cell lines were transfected using the TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent from Mirus Bio Corporation (Madison, WI). Luciferase reporter constructs were transiently co-transfected into the cells with pCS2-(n)-β-gal. Cells were then left untreated or treated overnight with PMA/ionomycin with or without cyclosporin A. Total cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined using Promega's luciferase assay system and Galacton-Plus from Tropix (Bedford, MA), respectively, in a MicroLumat LB 96 P luminometer (Berthold Analytical Instruments, Nashua, NH). Matrigel Invasion Assays—Invasion assays were performed essentially as described previously (39Jauliac S. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Shaw L.M. Brown L.F. Rao A. Toker A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Briefly, Transwell chambers with 8-μm pore filters (Corning, Acton, MA) were coated with 1–5 μgof Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Cells were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and added (1.0–1.5 × 105 cells/assay) in triplicates to Transwell chambers. The cells were allowed to invade the Matrigel-coated filters at 37 °C toward NIH 3T3-conditioned medium in the lower compartment. After 4–8 h, cells that had invaded to the lower surface of the filter were fixed and stained with crystal violet or 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and counted. PGE2 Measurements—PGE2 levels in the culture medium of treated cells were determined using a PGE2-monoclonal enzyme immunoassay kit from Cayman Chemical Co. according to the manufacturer's protocol. To collect culture medium supernatants for the assay, growth medium of the cells was replaced with serum-free medium, and after overnight incubation at 37 °C, cell culture medium was spiked with 10 μg/ml arachidonic acid and collected 30 min later. The samples were clarified by centrifugation and analyzed in triplicates. The amount of PGE2 in the culture medium was determined by referring to the signal intensities obtained from a set of PGE2 standards. Our previous study demonstrated that the α6β4 integrin, a tumor-associated antigen, up-regulates NFAT activity in breast carcinoma. We showed that although NFAT5 increases cell migration, NFAT1 promotes both migration and invasion (39Jauliac S. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Shaw L.M. Brown L.F. Rao A. Toker A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To identify the target genes induced by NFAT that are responsible for promoting migration and invasion, we established clones of MDA-MB-435 and SUM-159-PT cells that inducibly express NFAT1 upon stimulation with tetracycline or the analog doxycycline. As shown in Fig. 1A, NFAT1 expression was induced in doxycycline-treated clones of MDA-MB-435 (435.N1-23) and SUM-159-PT (SUM.N1-16) cells. Increased NFAT1 expression induction was also confirmed at the mRNA level by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether the induced NFAT1 was transcriptionally active, we transfected an IL-2 luciferase reporter plasmid. As predicted, the induced NFAT1 was functional at driving NFAT-dependent transcription of IL-2 (Fig. 1C). When the stable transfectants were allowed to invade Matrigel in an in vitro invasion assay, doxycycline-treated cells were significantly more invasive compared with their untreated controls (Fig. 1D), consistent with previous data (39Jauliac S. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Shaw L.M. Brown L.F. Rao A. Toker A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Using cDNA prepared from untreated and doxycycline-treated 435.N1-23 and SUM.N1-16 cells, we analyzed the gene expression profile induced subsequent to NFAT1 expression. A 6.06-fold (435.N1-23) and 3.05-fold (SUM.N1-16) induction of COX-2 was observed (data not shown). NFAT has been shown to bind to the COX-2 promoter and regulate its transcription in immune cells (19Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and a recent study has reported the regulation of COX-2 by NFAT in human colon carcinoma (38Duque J. Fresno M. Iniguez M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8686-8693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the relevance of NFAT in COX-2 regulation and function in breast cancer cell signaling or responses has not been determined. To address this question, we analyzed the expression of COX-2 in doxycycline-treated cells. COX-2 transcription measured by RT-PCR was increased upon NFAT1 expression induced by doxycycline (Fig. 2A). At the protein level, untreated SUM.N1-16 cells revealed low to undetectable levels of both NFAT1 and COX-2. After doxycycline treatment, NFAT1 expression significantly increased and was accompanied by a small but reproducible elevation in COX-2 protein (Fig. 2B). Stimulation with the NFAT agonists PMA and ionomycin led to a dramatic increase in COX-2 expression, likely because of the activation of endogenous NFAT. Moreover, combined treatment of doxycycline and PMA/ionomycin led to an even greater increase in NFAT1 and COX-2 expression (Fig. 2B). Next we determined whether the induction of COX-2 by NFAT1 is mediated through the transcriptional activation of the COX-2 promoter. SUM.N1-16 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with the pIL2-luc or the human COX-2 promoter luciferase reporter construct P2-274. Cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin showed a basal low level of NFAT activity when compared with untreated control (Fig. 3A, left panel). In contrast, induction of NFAT1 expression with doxycycline significantly increased the transcription of both IL-2 (Fig. 3A, left panel) and COX-2 (right panel). Maximum induction of IL-2 and COX-2 transcription was revealed when induced NFAT1 was activated by PMA/ionomycin. Blocking the activation of NFAT with CsA significantly diminished transcription from both reporters (Fig. 3A). As MDA-MB-231 cells have high levels of endogenous NFAT, we also examined the NFAT-driven IL-2 and COX-2 transcription in these cells. Activation of endogenous NFAT by PMA/ionomycin significantly increased transcriptions from both the IL-2 and COX-2 promoters (Fig. 3B). Again, NFAT inhibition by CsA reduced the induction of transcriptional activation of both reporters. To further investigate the regulation of COX-2 by NFAT, we have developed clones of SUM-159-PT cells in which NFAT expression is reduced by siRNA. Real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that two distinct clones expressed significantly less NFAT1 transcripts compared with parental SUM-159-PT cells. This was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-NFAT1 (Fig. 4A). Reduced NFAT1 expression with siRNA also markedly attenuated transcription from the IL-2 promoter in cells treated with PMA/ionomycin compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 4B). Most importantly, reduced expression of NFAT by siRNA also led to a quantitative reduction of COX-2 promoter luciferase activity (Fig. 4C). Finally, to demonstrate that loss of NFAT1 translates into loss of invasion, we measured Matrigel invasion in control SUM-159-PT cells compared with the stable siRNA clones. As predicted, reduced expression of NFAT1 by siRNA resulted in not only a loss of COX-2 expression but also a marked loss of invasion (Fig. 4D). To extend the above findings, we transiently transfected COX-2 into MDA-MB-435 and SUM-159-PT cells and measured Matrigel invasion. In both cell lines, COX-2 expression increased invasion (Fig. 5A). COX-2 expression was confirmed by immunoblotting. We also used a loss-of-function approach and constructed COX-2 siRNA to silence COX-2 expression. The efficacy of silencing endogenous COX-2 was determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5B). Next, SUM.N1-16 cells were transfected with either control or COX-2 siRNA, induced with doxycycline to express NFAT1, followed by Matrigel assays. When NFAT1 expression was induced in control transfected cells, as already demonstrated, this led to a reproducible increase in invasion. However, in the presence of COX-2 siRNA, invasion was reduced to control levels (Fig. 5C, left panel). COX-2 siRNA also significantly blunted Matrigel invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5C, right panel). These results demonstrate directly that at least one mechanism by which NFAT promotes invasion is through the induction of COX-2. PGE2 is the major product of COX-2. To further define the role of COX-2 induction by NFAT1 in the invasion phenotype, we assayed PGE2 levels in the culture medium of SUM.N1 cells. In control cells, low levels of PGE2 were detected, but these levels significantly increased when cells were stimulated by PMA/ionomycin to activate endogenous NFAT (Fig. 6A). Moreover, treatment with NS-398, a potent and specific COX-2 inhibitor, blocked PGE"
https://openalex.org/W2043847489,"Activation of sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) by overexpression or agonist stimulation promotes cell proliferation, survival, and anti-apoptosis. Studies on the function of endogenous SK1 are lacking. Endogenous SK1 has been shown to be down-regulated under stress, and knockdown of the enzyme reduces the percentage of viable MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Taha, T. A. et al. 2004. J. Biol. Chem. 279, 20546-20554). In this study, we examined the mechanisms by which SK1 loss affects the growth of cells. Knockdown of the enzyme by small interfering RNA caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis. Cell death involved effector caspase activation, cytochrome c release and Bax oligomerization in the mitochondrial membrane, thus placing SK1 knockdown upstream of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. SK1 knockdown also induced significant increases in ceramide levels in whole cells and in mitochondria enriched fractions of cells. Inhibition of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis with myriocin significantly attenuated Bax oligomerization and downstream caspase activation after SK1 loss. These studies for the first time implicate endogenous SK1 as an important survival enzyme in MCF-7 cells and link the biological consequences of knocking down the enzyme to its biochemical role as a regulator of sphingolipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2000870077,"The molecular mechanisms influencing muscle atrophy in humans are poorly understood. Atrogin-1 and MuRF1, two ubiquitin E3-ligases, mediate rodent and cell muscle atrophy and are suggested to be regulated by an Akt/Forkhead (FKHR) signaling pathway. Here we investigated the expression of atrogin-1, MuRF1, and the activity of Akt and its catabolic (FKHR and FKHRL1) and anabolic (p70(s6k) and GSK-3beta) targets in human skeletal muscle atrophy. The muscle atrophy model used was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). All measurements were performed in biopsies from 22 ALS patients and 16 healthy controls as well as in G93A ALS mice. ALS patients had a significant increase in atrogin-1 mRNA and protein content, which was associated with a decrease in Akt activity. There was no difference in the mRNA and protein content of FKHR, FKHRL1, p70(s6k), and GSK-3beta. Similar observations were made in the G93A ALS mice. Human skeletal muscle atrophy, as seen in the ALS model, is associated with an increase in atrogin-1 and a decrease in Akt. The transcriptional regulation of human atrogin-1 may be controlled by an Akt-mediated transcription factor other than FKHR or via another signaling pathway."

We present an innovative therapy based on the assignment of inactivated enzymes acting as scavengers for TIMP-1. Hepatic fibrosis was induced in BALB/c mice by repetitive intraperitoneal CCl4 injection. The animals were treated with proteolytic inactive matrix metalloproteinase-9 mutants (E402Q, H401A, E402H/H411E) using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Application of these MMP-9 mutants inhibited fibrogenesis, which was indicated by decreasing portal and periportal accumulation of collagen. Total hydroxyproline of liver tissue, the morphometric stage of fibrosis as well as mRNA expression of marker proteins for hepatic fibrosis in livers of E402Q- and H401A-treated mice were significantly reduced. MMP-9 mutants suppressed transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells to the myofibroblast like phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, adenoviral application of the mutants MMP-9-H401A and -E402Q led to increased apoptosis of activated hepatic stellate cells, thought to be the main promoters of hepatic fibrosis. Application of MMP-9 mutants as TIMP-1 scavengers may provide a new therapeutic strategy for hepatic fibrosis."

The GAGs play important roles in mediating biological functions of proteoglycans, mainly due to their ability to interact with a variety of proteins (1Iozzo R.V. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS) proteoglycans carry GAGs composed of alternating units of GalNAc and GlcA, or IdoUA in the case of DS. The chondroitin/CS/DS family has been ascribed a variety of physiological/developmental effects that range from control of basic cellular processes such as cell division in Caenorhabditis elegans, scaffold functions in various types of connective tissue, to highly cell type-specific effects, as exemplified by the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity mediated by rare structures in cerebral CS/DS (6Bao X.

Protein ligands targeted by CS/DS include growth factors, modulators of blood coagulation, selectins, and chemokines. It is important to define the CS/DS structures involved in selective protein binding and to understand how they are generated. The IdoUA-containing domains of DS chains are of particular significance in this regard, because IdoUA residues endow conformational flexibility to the polymer, which is believed to facilitate protein interactions (10Ferro D.R. Provasoli A. Ragazzi M. Casu B. Torri G. Bossennec V. Perly B. Sinay P. Petitou M. Choay J. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 195: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of CS/DS involves initial formation of a precursor polysaccharide composed of alternating GlcA and GalNAc residues, which subsequently undergoes a series of modification reactions (11Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Our previous studies established that the generation of IdoUA units in DS (12Malmstrom A. Fransson L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3419-3425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Malmstrom A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 161-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in heparin/heparan sulfate (14Hook M. Lindahl U. Backstrom G. Malmstrom A. Fransson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3908-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), occurs by C5-epimerization of a portion of the GlcA residues previously incorporated into the polysaccharide chain. Moreover, CS/DS polysaccharides are O-sulfated at C2 of GlcA and IdoUA and C4 and/or C6 of GalNAc (15Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Notably, IdoUA units are consistently found adjacent to 4-O-sulfated GalNAc residues. The extent of these modifications varies between tissues and seems to be influenced by the core protein structure (16Seidler D.G. Breuer E. Grande-Allen K.J. Hascall V.C. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42409-42416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, both epimerization and sulfation can be affected by growth factors (17Tiedemann K. Olander B. Eklund E. Todorova L. Bengtsson M. Maccarana M. Westergren-Thorsson G. Malmstrom A. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate and CS/DS have been cloned, all except the chondroitin-glucuronate C5-epimerase required for IdoUA formation in DS (in the following denoted DS epimerase). In this study, we therefore purified this enzyme ∼43,000-fold from bovine spleen microsomes and identified by mass spectrometry a candidate protein, SART2 (squamous cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cells 2) that had previously been cloned but not assigned any specific function. Transgenic expression of this protein in mammalian cell lines yielded a product with DS epimerase activity, capable of inducing IdoUA formation in exogenous chondroitin substrate. Moreover, cells transfected with DS epimerase synthesized dermatan sulfate chains with increased IdoUA content compared with mock-transfected control cells.

After defructosylation (18Rodriguez M.L. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J.

Protease inhibitors were obtained from Sigma and applied at a final concentration of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Metabolically 3H- or 14C-labeled K4 polysaccharides (DS epimerase substrates) were prepared by growing a K4-producing Escherichia coli strain in medium containing d-[5-3H]glucose or d-[1-14C]glucose, as described previously (20Hannesson H.H.

The resulting labeled K4 polysaccharides were defructosylated (dK4). HS epimerase substrate was generated in an analogous manner by incubating E. coli K5 bacteria with d-[5-3H]glucose, followed by N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of the resultant radiolabeled polysaccharide (21Hagner-McWhirter A. Lindahl U. Li J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 69-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hagner-McWhirter A. Li J.P. Oscarson S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14631-14638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DS epimerase was assayed by its ability to release 3H-labeled water from chondroitin substrate containing [3H]GlcA residues, essentially as described (23Malmstrom A. Aberg L. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but with some modifications based on preliminary kinetics analysis of semipurified enzyme (data not shown). Enzyme samples, containing 3 mg of BSA as carrier unless otherwise stated, were desalted at 4 °C on Sephadex G-25 columns (0.7 × 3 cm), equilibrated with desalting buffer (20 mm MES (pH 5.5 at 37 °C), 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors). Incubations were performed in a 100-μl final volume of 0.8× desalting buffer, 0.5 mg of BSA, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 30,000 dpm [5-3H]dK4 or [1-14C]dK4 (∼200 μm HexA for both substrates). Incubations were done at 37 °C for 2–14 h and stopped by boiling for 5 min, and samples were centrifuged. For quantitation of [3H]water, 90 μl of the incubations were transferred to a distillation tube containing 200 μl of (unlabeled) water. After distillation (24Backstrom G. Hook M. Lindahl U. Feingold D.S. Malmstrom A. Roden L. Jacobsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 200μl of the distillate was analyzed by scintillation counting. The assay is linear up to 3000 dpm of released 3H. Protein was estimated by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), using BSA as standard. HexA content was determined by the carbazole reaction (25Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar). Bovine spleen was obtained fresh from the local slaughterhouse and was processed immediately. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C, and all buffers contained 1 mm DTT as reducing agent. Step 1. Microsomal Preparation and Extraction—On day 1, three spleens were freed from surrounding fat tissue, cut into 1–2-cm cubes, washed twice with cold distilled water, and placed in homogenization buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors). Batches of 350 × g of tissue were first homogenized without any added buffer in a food processor and were then rehomogenized three times after step additions of 350, 500, and 500 ml of buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 8,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 38,400 × g for 45 min. The 38,400 × g pellet was extracted with 90 ml of solubilization buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors). The combined extracted material from 11 such preparations, in all corresponding to 3.9 kg of tissue, was subjected to two strokes with a 200-ml Potter device and centrifuged at 38,400 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was collected. On day 2, the final supernatant from day 1 was further centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 40 min. Approximately half of the resulting supernatant was clear and was collected, whereas the other half was turbid and was diluted 1:2 with solubilization buffer and recentrifuged, and the resulting clear supernatant was collected. Step 2. Red-Sepharose—The microsomal extract was applied at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min to a Red-Sepharose column (5 × 13 cm). After application, the flow rate increased to 8 ml/min. The column was washed with 50 bed volumes of 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100; further washed with 4 bed volumes of 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (Buffer A) containing 150 mm NaCl; and finally eluted with 4 liters of 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 m NaCl. Step 3. ConA-Sepharose—The eluted material from Step 2 was adjusted to 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 and applied to a column of ConA-Sepharose (2.6 × 6 cm; gel not reutilized) run at 2 ml/min. The gel was washed with 30 bed volumes of 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Buffer B), 0.5 m NaCl, and then with 6 bed volumes of Buffer B, 20 mm NaCl. To save elution buffer (Buffer B, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 m methyl-α-d-mannoside) and increase recovery, five 90-ml elutions were performed, each involving about 12 cycles each of 30 min of buffer recirculation followed by 30 min without recirculation. Step 4. dK4-Sepharose—The eluate from Step 3 was applied to a dK4-Sepharose column (2.6 × 3 cm) at 2 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of Buffer A, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm CHAPS, further washed with 10 bed volumes of Buffer A, 20 mm NaCl, and finally eluted with Buffer A, 150 mm NaCl. Fractions with epimerase activity were pooled, dialyzed versus Buffer A, 10 mm NaCl, and concentrated by applying them to a Mono-Q 5/5 column, run at 0.5 ml/min. After application, the column was inverted and eluted at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min with Buffer A, 1 m NaCl. Step 5. Superose 12—The 1-ml concentrated material from Step 4 was injected to a Superose 12 column, which was subsequently eluted at 0.05 ml/min with Buffer A, 150 mm NaCl. Fractions of ∼0.3 ml were collected (Fig. 2A) and analyzed for epimerase activity. Active fractions were pooled, diluted with Buffer A to a final NaCl concentration of 20 mm, and concentrated on a Mono-Q PC 1.6/5 column, operated as described above. Step 6. Superose 12—The 0.2-ml concentrated material from Step 5 was injected to a second Superose 12 column, operated as above. Step 7. Red-Sepharose—The most active fraction from the previous step was diluted with Buffer A to 100 mm NaCl; CHAPS was added to final 10 mm concentration, and the sample was batch-incubated with 50 μl of fresh Red-Sepharose gel. After incubation for 2 h, the gel was washed five times with 500 μl of Buffer A, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CHAPS, further washed five times with 1 ml of the same solution without CHAPS, and finally eluted with 10 × 150 μl of Buffer A, 2 m NaCl. The ∼0.6 million-fold purified analytical sample shown in Fig. 2B, lane 2, was prepared as above, with one modification; an initial elution step with Buffer A, 1 m NaCl preceded the final elution with Buffer A, 2 m NaCl. The final eluate contained ∼10% of the epimerase activity incubated with the Red-Sepharose gel. Material from the last purification step was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the pellet was resuspended in reducing Laemmli buffer. SDS-PAGE was carried out on NuPAGE pre-made 10% acrylamide gels (Invitrogen) that were stained with Brilliant Blue G Colloidal staining solution (Sigma). Gel bands of interest were cut out, and the proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega) as described (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization-based LC-MS/MS analyses were carried out using an Agilent 1100 series instrumentation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) on a 75-μm × 10.5-cm fused silica microcapillary reversed phase column (5-μm Magic C18 beads; Michrom Bioresources). The column was eluted at 200 nl/min using a gradient of 5–35% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, over a 50-min period as described (27Lee H. Yi E.C. Wen B. Reily T.P. Pohl L. Nelson S. Aebersold R. Goodlett D.R. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2004; 803: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). LC-MS/MS was performed using an LTQ ion trap (Thermofinnigan, San Jose, CA) with an electrospray voltage of 2 kV. The instrument was set up to perform one MS scan (400–1600 Da) followed by three MS/MS analyses in a data-dependent mode with an intensity threshold of 15,000 counts. The repeat count was set to 3, the repeat duration to 30 s, and the exclusion duration was 60 s; and the exclusion list size was 100. Data base search was carried out using SEQUEST (28Yates III, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), and the search results were further analyzed by peptide and protein prophet as described previously (29Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3897) Google Scholar, 30Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4646-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3635) Google Scholar). The identified peptides and corresponding proteins were stored and analyzed in a MySQL data model, which was used to accommodate further analysis of the data (31Malmstrom L. Marko-Varga G. Westergren-Thorsson G. Laurell T. Malmstrom J. BMC Bioinformatics,. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). SART2 human cDNA clone (IMAGE number 5272885) was obtained from RZPD, Germany, and subcloned into pcDNA 3.1/myc-His vector (Invitrogen) using XhoI and AgeI restriction sites (underlined in the primers) introduced by PCR using primers 5′-GATCCTCGAGATGAGGACTCACACACGGGG-3′ and 5′-GATCACCGGTACACTGTGATTGGGAACAAGA-3′, respectively. The insert was confirmed by sequencing. Ligation into the expression vector resulted in a construct with SART2 in-frame with a C-terminal His6 tag. CHO-K1 cells, maintained in F12-K medium, 10% FBS, HFL-1 cells and 293HEK cells, both maintained in minimum Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, were grown in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with pcDNA-His or pcDNA SART2-His plasmid, using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 48 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors. After 30 min at 4 °C, cell lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 20,000 × g, and 200 μl of the supernatant was desalted (without carrier BSA added prior to desalting), followed by determination of protein content and enzyme activity. DA strain rats, 6 weeks old, were sacrificed, and the organs were put in ∼3-fold excess (v/w) lysis buffer (see above for buffer composition and lysate preparation). The predominantly muscular tissues heart, uterus, and skeletal muscle were ground and further homogenized by three Potter strokes. For the remaining soft tissues the use of the Potter homogenizer alone was adequate. Two strategies were adopted to analyze the reaction products. In one experimental set, samples of 15,000 dpm of [1-14C]dK4, recovered after incubation with cellular lysate as described in Fig. 4A, were digested with chondroitinase AC-I, and the split products were analyzed by gel chromatography, as described below. Alternatively, the overall composition of enzyme-incubated [1-14C]-labeled dK4 was determined by analysis of labeled HexA-aTalR disaccharides, generated by N-deacetylation followed by deaminative cleavage and reduction of the products essentially as described (20Hannesson H.H. Hagner-McWhirter A. Tiedemann K. Lindahl U. Malmstrom A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were subjected to hydrazinolysis (64% hydrazine, 36% H2O, 1% hydrazine sulfate) at 100 °C for 16 h, and the product was reisolated on a PD-10 column eluted with water and then treated with HNO2 at pH 3.9. The resultant disaccharides, representing 64% of the total radioactivity, were reduced with NaBH4 and recovered by gel chromatography on a Superdex Peptide column, eluted at 0.3 ml/min with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The labeled disaccharides were separated by paper chromatography (20Hannesson H.H. Hagner-McWhirter A. Tiedemann K. Lindahl U. Malmstrom A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of 293HEK cells, grown in 75-cm2 flasks was performed as described above, with pcDNA-His or pcDNA SART2-His plasmid. After transfection, cell were grown for 24 h in ordinary minimum Eagle's medium, washed once in sulfur-deprived Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, maintained for 2 h in 10 ml of sulfur-deprived Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, and finally 100 μCi/ml 35SO4 was added. After an additional 24-h culture period, medium was collected and applied to a 2-ml DE52 column, equilibrated with 50 mm acetate, pH 5.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 6 m urea. The column was washed with 30 bed volumes of equilibration buffer and then with 5 volumes of water, 5 volumes of 0.2 m NH4HCO3, and finally eluted with 10 volumes of 2 m NH4HCO3. Ten μg of cold DS were added, and the samples were lyophilized and then subjected to alkaline β-elimination (50 mm KOH, 1 m NaBH4, 45 °C for 16 h). GAG chains were reisolated using the DE52 column, operated as described above. The GAG chains were deaminated at pH 1.5 (32Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and intact CS/DS chains were recovered after gel filtration. 35S-Labeled CS/DS chains (15,000 dpm) were digested for 4 h at 37 °C in 200 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl/sodium acetate, pH 7.3, with 36 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC or 10 milliunits of chondroitinase AC-I. Chondroitinase B digestions were performed with 8 milliunits of enzyme in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl/sodium acetate, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.01% BSA. Digests were heated at 100 °C for 2 min, mixed with 100 μg of heparin, and applied to a Superdex Peptide column, operated at 0.3 ml/min in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Purification of DS Epimerase—Initial data base searches for clues to the DS epimerase coding sequence based on similarity with the HS or alginate C5-epimerases were unsuccessful, and we therefore decided to isolate the DS epimerase protein. Screening various rat tissues for enzyme activity pointed to spleen as the richest source of DS epimerase (Fig. 1). A survey of bovine tissues gave similar results (data not shown), and bovine spleen was therefore selected as starting material for purification of DS epimerase. The overall purification process (see “Experimental Procedures”) is summarized in Table 1. Solubilized microsomes were first applied to Red-Sepharose gel, yielding a 10-fold purification with excellent recovery. A ConA-Sepharose column efficiently removed contaminants but allowed only 30–40% recovery of epimerase activity. dK4-Sepharose provided consistent 3-fold purification, with high recovery. After concentration, the partially purified enzyme was applied to a Superose 12 column. Most of the protein emerged as high molecular weight complexes, but the epimerase fraction was more retarded and relatively homogeneous in size, being eluted 4-fold and purified with the peak of activity at the position of a 67-kDa marker (Fig. 2A). Size fractionation was refined by reapplication of the active pool to the same column, thus yielding a sharp peak with 80% of the eluted activity in two effluent fractions, again with a 4-fold purification. The most active fraction was incubated, batchwise, with a small amount of Red-Sepharose gel. Most of the activity was recovered and 14-fold further purified. The complexity of this sample, purified altogether ∼43,000-fold, was assessed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B, lane 1). An 89-kDa band was considered of particular interest, because the (Colloidal Blue) staining intensity of this band in the eluted fractions from Superose 12 and Red-Sepharose correlated with epimerase activity (data not shown). Furthermore, by modifying the elution conditions of the last purification on Red-Sepharose (see “Experimental Procedures”), ∼0.6 millionfold purified active material was obtained, at the expense of recovery. Silver staining after SDS-PAGE showed the 89-kDa band as a major component (Fig. 2B, lane 2).TABLE 1Purification of DS epimeraseTotal proteinTotal activityRecoverySpecific activityPurificationmgdpm/h × 10-6%dpm/h/mg × 10-3-foldMicrosomal preparation (step 1)12,1029210081Red-Sepharose (step 2)1,03377847510ConA-Sepharose (step 3)54283052068dK4-Sepharose (step 4)10.9 (6.5)aValues are given in parentheses after concentration.18 (12)aValues are given in parentheses after concentration.19 (13)aValues are given in parentheses after concentration.1,650220Superose 12 (step 5)1.53 (0.32)aValues are given in parentheses after concentration.9.3 (6.6)aValues are given in parentheses after concentration.10 (7)aValues are given in parentheses after concentration.6,080800Superose 12 (step 6)0.0671.82.026,9003,500Red-Sepharose (step 7)∼0.004bEvaluation was from Colloidal Blue staining after SDS-PAGE.1.31.4∼330,000∼43,000Red-Sepharose (step 7), analytical samplecSee purification, “Step 7” under “Experimental Procedures.”∼1 ngdEvaluation was from silver staining after SDS-PAGE.0.005NAeNA indicates not applicable.∼5,000,000∼600,000a Values are given in parentheses after concentration.b Evaluation was from Colloidal Blue staining after SDS-PAGE.c See purification, “Step 7” under “Experimental Procedures.”d Evaluation was from silver staining after SDS-PAGE.e NA indicates not applicable. Open table in a new tab Gene Identification—Seven SDS-PAGE Colloidal Blue-stained bands (Fig. 2B, lane 1) were trypsinized and subjected to electrospray ionization-based LC-MS/MS analysis. Data base search of the results against the NCBI nonredundant (NRP.nci.fasta.20041115) data base yielded 56 proteins identified with more than one peptide matched and with a protein prophet probability of 1.0 (29Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3897) Google Scholar, 30Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4646-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3635) Google Scholar). Several proteins were identified in more than one band, decreasing the number of unique proteins identified to 33. The following four proteins were identified from the 89-kDa gel band, believed to contain the DS epimerase: human SART2 (UPTR:Q9UL01; 6 peptides), lactotransferrin (gi.7428768; 11 peptides), hu-k4 (Q92853; 2 peptides), and pld3 protein (O35405; 2 peptides). The seven LC-MS/MS runs were then searched against a data base generated from the merged output from two genome-wide gene-finder programs, GenScan and GeneId and protein sequences from Bos taurus at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

https://openalex.org/W1979770213,"Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are ubiquitous transcription factors that mediate adaptation to hypoxia by inducing specific sets of target genes. It is well accepted that hypoxia induces accumulation and activity of HIFs by causing stabilization of their alpha subunits. We have demonstrated that hypoxia stimulates translation of HIF-1alpha and -2alpha proteins by distributing HIF-alpha mRNAs to larger polysome fractions. This requires influx of extracellular calcium, stimulation of classical protein kinase C-alpha (cPKC-alpha), and the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR. The translational component contributes to approximately 40-50% of HIF-alpha proteins accumulation after 3 h of 1% O2. Hypoxia also inhibits general protein synthesis and mTOR activity; however, cPKC-alpha inhibitors or rapamycin reduce mTOR activity and total protein synthesis beyond the effects of hypoxia alone. These data show that during general inhibition of protein synthesis by hypoxia, cap-mediated translation of selected mRNAs is induced through the mTOR pathway. We propose that calcium-induced activation of cPKC-alpha hypoxia partially protects an activity of mTOR from hypoxic inhibition. These results provide an important physiologic insight into the mechanism by which hypoxia-stimulated influx of calcium selectively induces the translation of mRNAs necessary for adaptation to hypoxia under conditions repressing general protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2113961541,"Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) catalyzes the first committed step in triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipid biosynthesis. GPAT activity has been identified in both ER and mitochondrial subcellular fractions. The ER activity dominates in most tissues except in liver, where the mitochondrial isoform (mtGPAT) can constitute up to 50% of the total activity. To study the in vivo effects of hepatic mtGPAT overexpression, mice were transduced with adenoviruses expressing either murine mtGPAT or a catalytically inactive variant of the enzyme. Overexpressing mtGPAT resulted in massive 12- and 7-fold accumulation of liver TAG and diacylglycerol, respectively but had no effect on phospholipid or cholesterol ester content. Histological analysis showed extensive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Furthermore, mtGPAT transduction markedly increased adipocyte differentiation-related protein and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) in the liver. In line with increased SCD-1 expression, 18:1 and 16:1 in the hepatic TAG fraction increased. In addition, mtGPAT overexpression decreased ex vivo fatty acid oxidation, increased liver TAG secretion rate 2-fold, and increased plasma TAG and cholesterol levels. These results support the hypothesis that increased hepatic mtGPAT activity associated with obesity and insulin resistance contributes to increased TAG biosynthesis and inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, responses that would promote hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W2021255508,"Immunization with amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides or passive immunization with antibodies against Abeta has been reported to reduce plaque burden, neuritic dystrophy, early Tau pathology, microgliosis as well as reversing learning and memory deficits. This has created a central paradox: how does vaccination in peripheral tissues reduce plaque burden in the brain? No single explanation for these phenomena has yet been presented. To reconcile these observations, we demonstrate that the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a structural barrier between the brain and the blood, is compromised in Tg2576 Alzheimer disease (AD) model mice. We immunized Tg2576 mice with Abeta before and after the onset of AD-type neuropathology and observed that BBB permeability, amyloid burden, and microgliosis are decreased in immunized mice. It is concluded that the integrity of the BBB is disrupted in AD mice, and after Abeta immunization the immune system clears Abeta from sources in the brain as it would in peripheral organs lacking barriers. Once Abeta is removed, the integrity of the BBB is restored. The data therefore provide an intellectual framework for understanding how the immune system can clear amyloid deposits from AD brains and suggest new strategies for limiting disease progression in amyloidopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2169922833,"The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) -PAS domain containing transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 are two major components of the circadian molecular oscillator. It is known that the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex positively regulates the activity of E-box containing promoters. Here we demonstrate that the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex can also suppress the activity of some promoters upon its interaction with CRYPTOCHROME (CRY). Such a dual function of the circadian transcriptional complex provides a mechanistic explanation for the unpredicted pattern of circadian gene expression in the tissues of Bmal1 null mice. We speculate that the switch from transcriptional activation to transcriptional repression may provide a highly efficient mechanism for circadian control of gene expression. We also show that CLOCK/BMAL1 can interfere with promoter regulation by other, non-circadian, transcription factors including N-MYC and ETS, leading to attenuation or abrogation of transcription of CLOCK/BMAL1-controlled stress-induced genes. We propose that, based upon these results, both circadian repression and activation of the transcription of different target genes are required for circadian responses to various external stimuli, including genotoxic stress induced by anticancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1969995846,"Retinal capillary pericytes undergo premature death, possibly by apoptosis, during the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. The α-oxoaldehyde, methylglyoxal (MGO), has been implicated as a cause of cell damage in diabetes. We have investigated the role of MGO and its metabolizing enzyme, glyoxalase I, in high glucose-induced apoptosis (annexin V binding) of human retinal pericyte (HRP). HRP incubated with high glucose (30 mm d-glucose) for 7 days did not undergo apoptosis despite accumulation of MGO. However, treatment with a combination of high glucose and S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester, a competitive inhibitor of glyoxalase I, resulted in apoptosis along with a dramatic increase in MGO. Overexpression of glyoxalase I in HRP protected against S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester-induced apoptosis under high glucose conditions. Incubation of HRP with high concentrations of MGO resulted in an increase of apoptosis relative to untreated controls. We found an elevation of nitric oxide (NO·) in HRP that was incubated with high glucose when compared with those incubated with either the l-glucose or untreated controls. When HRP were incubated with an NO· donor, DETANONOATE ((Z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate), we observed both decreased glyoxalase I expression and activity relative to untreated control cells. Further studies showed that HRP underwent apoptosis when incubated with DETANONOATE and that apoptosis increased further on co-incubation with high glucose. Our findings indicate that glyoxalase I is critical for pericyte survival under hyperglycemic conditions, and its inactivation and/or down-regulation by NO· may contribute to pericyte death by apoptosis during the early stages of diabetic retinopathy.

Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness in the working age population (1Stitt A.W. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2003; 75: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Loss of pericytes from the retinal microvas-culature is considered one of the earliest hallmarks of diabetic retinopathy (2Addison D.J. Garner A. Ashton N. Br. Med.

Yanoff M. Jian B. He Z. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-le-grand). 1999; 45: 59-66PubMed Google Scholar, 5Podesta F. Romeo G. Liu W.H. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Gerhardinger C. Lorenzi M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Once pericytes are eliminated from retinal capillaries, endothelial cell death follows with the subsequent formation of acellular capillaries (6Hammes H.P. Horm. Metab. Res. 2005; 37: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the proliferative form of the disease, areas containing acellular capillaries become ischemic and subsequently non-perfused. Non-perfused regions of the retina suffer hypoxia, which causes the expression of a number of angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (7Aiello L.P. Pierce E.A. Foley E.D.

New blood vessels that grow toward the vitreous are fragile and prone to rupture, resulting in retinal detachment. In both diabetic humans and animal models of diabetes, retinal capillary pericytes and endothelial cells die, possibly by apoptosis, as indicated by observations of terminal dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells in capillaries (9Mizutani M. Kern T.S. Lorenzi M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 2883-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and activation of key apoptotic proteins and caspases in the retina (10Mohr S. Xi X. Tang J. Kern T.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). One recent study suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction causes apoptosis of both endothelial cells and pericytes in retinas of diabetics (11Kowluru R.A. Abbas S.N. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5327-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Other studies documented activation of pro-apoptotic caspases and other apoptotic pathway proteins in the diabetic retina (12Kusner L.L. Sarthy V.P. Mohr S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 1553-1561PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kowluru R.A. Koppolu P. Free Radic. Res. 2002; 36: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Some investigators proposed that the frequency of early apoptosis in retinal pericytes was the major determinant for development of diabetic retinopathy (14Kern T.S. Tang J. Mizutani M. Kowluru R.A. Nagaraj R.H. Romeo G. Podesta F. Lorenzi M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3972-3978PubMed Google Scholar). Exactly how pericytes undergo apoptosis is still uncertain, although evidence suggests various biochemical mechanisms (5Podesta F. Romeo G. Liu W.H. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Gerhardinger C. Lorenzi M.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2241-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), including triggering of a pro-apoptotic program by activation of NF-κB in response to hyperglycemia (16Romeo G. Liu W.-H. Asnaghi V. Kern T.S. Lorenzi M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2241-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cultured pericytes undergo apoptosis in the presence of high concentrations of glucose (11Kowluru R.A. Abbas S.N. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5327-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), implying that glucose-driven processes cause or enhance their death. MGO 2The abbreviations used are: MGO, methylglyoxal; glu, glucose; AGE, advanced glycation end product; BBGC, bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DETANONOATE, (Z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate; HRP, human retinal pericytes; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. is an α-oxoaldehyde that is highly reactive with lysine or arginine residues in proteins, modifying them at their amine moieties to form AGEs (17Nagaraj R.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6928-6936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of both MGO and AGEs have been observed in serum and various tissues of diabetic patients, respectively (19Beisswenger P.J. Howell S.K. Touchette A.D. Lal S. Szwergold B.S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 20Monnier V.M. Sell D.R. Nagaraj R.H. Miyata S. Grandhee S. Odetti P. Ibrahim S.A. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 36-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both AGEs and MGO cause pericyte apoptosis (21Denis U. Lecomte M. Paget C. Ruggiero D. Wiernsperger N. Lagarde M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Kim J. Son J.W. Lee J.A. Oh Y.S. Shinn S.H. J. Korean Med. Sci. 2004; 19: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Apoptosis prompted by this mechanism is probably due to enhanced oxidative stress within the cells. In fact, antioxidants inhibit apoptosis caused by MGO and AGEs (22Kim J. Son J.W. Lee J.A. Oh Y.S. Shinn S.H. J. Korean Med. Sci. 2004; 19: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Kowluru R.A. Life Sci. 2005; 76: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We showed that extracellular matrix proteins modified by dicarbonyls induce pericytes apoptosis as well (24Liu B. Bhat M. Padival A.K. Smith D.G. Nagaraj R.H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 1983-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of the polyol pathway is implicated in pericyte apoptosis (25Murata T. Ishibashi T. Khalil A. Hata Y. Yoshikawa H. Inomata H. Ophthalmic Res. 1995; 27: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 26Dagher Z. Park Y.S. Asnaghi V. Hoehn T. Gerhardinger C. Lorenzi M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2404-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Retinal capillary cells produce insulin-like growth factor-1, and a recent study related loss of retinal pericytes to excessive levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (27Ruberte J. Ayuso E. Navarro M. Carretero A. Nacher V. Haurigot V. George M. Llombart C. Casellas A. Costa C. Bosch A. Bosch F. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Until now, studies were concerned with damage of pericytes by high glucose, but there was little emphasis on how high glucose stress influences enzymes within these cells. Glyoxalase I is an integral part of the cellular machinery for removal of MGO. The glyoxalase system is composed of two enzymes; glyoxalase I, which metabolizes MGO to S-d-lactoylglutathione, and glyoxalase II, which converts S-d-lactoylglutathione to d-lactate. Work by Shinohara et al. (28Shinohara M. Thornalley P.J. Giardino I. Beisswenger P. Thorpe S.R. Onorato J. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of glyoxalase I in bovine endothelial cells reduced intracellular AGEs when the cells were cultured in the presence of high glucose. In addition, a series of studies indicated that certain tumor primary cultures and cell lines overexpress glyoxalase I (29Davidson S.D. Milanesa D.M. Mallouh C. Choudhury M.S. Tazaki H. Konno S. Urol. Res. 2002; 30: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Rulli A. Carli L. Romani R. Baroni T. Giovannini E. Rossi G. Talesa V. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2001; 66: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggesting that increased amounts of this enzyme prevent tumor cell apoptosis (31Sakamoto H. Mashima T. Kizaki A. Dan S. Hashimoto Y. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Blood. 2000; 95: 3214-3218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly by limiting MGO production. These findings spurred us to determine whether impaired function of glyoxalase I could result in HRP apoptosis in diabetes. Materials—Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (with 5 mmol/liter d-glucose), 0.25% trypsin, 0.1% EDTA, and Hanks' balanced salt solution were purchased from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). Fetal bovine serum and antibiotic/mycotic solution were purchased from Invitrogen. Endothelial growth supplement, insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite (ITS), porcine esterase, nitrate reductase, and MGO (40% solution) were purchased from Sigma. MGO was purified by distilling twice under low pressure and temperature. The TACS-annexin apoptosis detection kit was purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Annexin-647 was obtained from Invitrogen. Bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (BBGC) was synthesized as previously described (32Thornalley P.J. Edwards L.G. Kang Y. Wyatt C. Davies N. Ladan M.J. Double J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The NO· donor DETANONOATE was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Isolation, Culture, and Characterization of HRP—HRP were isolated by the method of Grant and Guay (33Grant M. Guay C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Two sets of eyes from two non-diabetic donors (aged 41 and 72) were received 23 h after death from the Cleveland Eye Bank. Retina were detached from the pigmented layer, placed on 55-μm nylon mesh, and macerated while flooding with 2% bovine serum albumin in Hanks' balanced salt solution. The vasculature was transferred to a flask containing 5 mg/ml collagenase (Type I, Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) and stirred for 30-45 min at 37 °C. Collagenase was inactivated by the addition of growth media (1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 15 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 1× ITS, antibiotic/antimycotic (10 units of penicillin, 10 μg of streptomycin, 25 μg of amphotericin)), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was washed once with 5 ml of growth medium and centrifuged again. The final pellet was re-suspended in 10 ml of growth medium and seeded onto 2 × 25 cm2 flasks pre-coated with gelatin. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with a change of medium every 2-4 days until the cells attained near confluence. Cells were detached by washing with PBS then covered with 0.25% trypsin, 0.1% EDTA for 60-90 s. Fresh medium was added, and the cells were centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in growth media, and cells were plated in 10-cm2 dishes. Positive staining for both smooth muscle actin a subunit (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and NG-2 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) identified the cultured cells as pericytes (Fig. 1). Once they were successfully characterized as HRP, the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. They were used between passages 3-7 for all experiments detailed below. Cell Experiments—HRP were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in either 30 mm d-or 25 mm l-glucose (d-glu or l-glu) until the cultures reached 80% confluence (typically 7 days). The medium was replaced every 2 days. For apoptosis experiments with BBGC, 80% confluent HRP were treated with BBGC and incubated for a further 24 h. BBGC dissolved in Me2SO was added to achieve final concentrations of 25, 50, 100, and 200 μm. The final concentration of Me2SO in the media was estimated to be <5 mm. In later experiments cells were incubated for 6 days with either 30 mm d- or 25 mm l-glu. The inclusion of 5 mm d-glu in our normal medium brought the final glucose concentration to 30 mm in these experiments. Along with the addition of glucose, the cells were also treated with either 35 μm BBGC or Me2SO alone (3.9 μl/10 ml media) and incubated 24 h longer. For apoptosis and quantitative PCR experiments, 80% confluent HRP were incubated for 24 h with the NO· donor, DETANONOATE, at final concentrations of 100, 250, 500 μm, 1 mm, and 1.2 mm. In another experiment cells were incubated with either 30 mm d- or 25 mm l-glu for 6 days and then treated with 1 mm DETANONOATE for the final 24 h. For measurement of apoptosis, the media serum concentration was reduced to 2% 24 h before further treatment. MGO or glyoxal (175 μm) in 2% serum-containing media was then added to 80% confluent cultures. After 24 h the cells were supplied with fresh media containing either MGO or glyoxal and 35 μm BBGC in Me2SO or Me2SO alone. The cultures were then incubated for 24 h longer. Measurement of Glyoxalase I Activity—Cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA for 5 min, washed with PBS, and harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1:100 diluted protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), subjected to 3 freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, and sonicated for 20 s on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and extensively dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 °C, and the supernatant was tested for glyoxalase I activity as previously described (28Shinohara M. Thornalley P.J. Giardino I. Beisswenger P. Thorpe S.R. Onorato J. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 mmol of S-d-lactoylglutathione/min/mg of protein. Protein concentration of lysates was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay solution (Bio-Rad). For BBGC de-esterification, BBGC dissolved in 10% Me2SO was added to 0.5 units of esterase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Controls contained esterase or BBGC alone in either 10% Me2SO or 50 mm Tris-HCl. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, 50 μg of lysate was added, and the mixtures were incubated 1 h longer. Glyoxalase I activity was measured as described above. Flow Cytometry—After exposure of cells to BBGC and DETANONOATE, the incubation media along with any detached HRP was removed and retained. The adherent cells were detached with trypsin, mixed with the retained media, and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then incubated with fluoroisothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptosis was quantified using a Beckman Coulter XL flow cytometer (Fullerton, CA) equipped with an argon-ion laser for excitation at 488 nm. Fifteen thousand cells were analyzed per sample. HRP treated with 1 μm staurosporine (Kamiya Biomedical Co., Seattle, WA) for 1.5 h were positive controls for apoptosis. We used the same procedure for transfected cells (see below), except annexin V-647 was substituted for annexin V-fluoroisothiocyanate. The samples were analyzed with a BD Biosciences LSR I flow cytometer (San Jose, CA) using 2 laser excitations; a 488-nm argon laser for propidium iodide and a 633 nm helium/neon laser for annexin V-647 fluorescence. At least 20,000 events were collected for transfection experiments. Quantification of MGO in HRP—HRP cultures were washed with PBS, the cells were detached with trypsin, pooled with the media in which they had been incubated, and collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 10% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was derivatized with 7 mm 6-hydroxy-2,4,5-triaminopyrimidine at 60 °C for 45 min. The subsequent pterin adduct (6-methylpterin) was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography as previously described (34Padayatti P.S. Jiang C. Glomb M.A. Uchida K. Nagaraj R.H. Curr. Eye Res. 2001; 23: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Glyoxalase I Expression after Treatment with DETANONOATE—Cells were treated with various concentrations of DETANONOATE as described for the apoptosis experiments. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 0.5 μg of RNA was subjected to reverse transcription-PCR using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was diluted 10× in distilled H2O. Ten μl of cDNA was added to the appropriate primers (final concentration of primers was 1 μm). The human glyoxalase I forward primer was 5-CCGCCATGATTCACATTTGA-3, and the reverse primer was 5-GTTGGCATGGCCTTTCCA-3. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression was used to normalize expression. Human GAPDH M33197 forward primer (5-ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGA-3) and reverse primer (5-CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGT-3) were added to cDNA in parallel. Twelve μl of SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was added to these mixtures, and quantitative PCR was done with an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The relative -fold difference in expression was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCT method (35Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127074) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection of HRP with Vector Harboring Glyoxalase I—The human glyoxalase I sequence (accession number NM_006708) was PCR-amplified from a pUC 19 vector harboring the gene (gift from Dr. Sulabha Ranganathan, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). We introduced restriction sites NheI and KpnI and subcloned the sequence into pCMS-EGFP (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to form pCMS-EGFP-glyI. Next, we used 10 μg of either pCMS-EGFP or pCMS-EGFP-glyI to transfect 8 × 105 HRP in 100 μl of Basic Nucleofector™ kit for Primary Smooth Muscle Cell solution (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). Mock-transfected cells were prepared by substituting sterile distilled H2O for DNA. The remainder of the transfection procedure was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electroporation was carried out with a Nucleofector II apparatus (Amaxa) using the P-13 program. After electroporation, each sample containing 8 × 105 cells was incubated in 500 μl of RPMI (Cambrex, Pittsburgh, PA) for 15 min and then diluted 1:7 in HRP media in a 60-mm dish. Transfected cells were incubated between 48-72 h with a change of medium every day. The percentage of cells transfected was estimated by counting green fluorescent protein-expressing cells through a Nikon Eclipse TS100 light microscope (Melville, NY) fitted with an epifluorescence attachment and camera (Digital Sight DS-L1, Nikon). For apoptosis experiments immediately after transfection, the cells were incubated for 48 h in media supplemented with either 30 mm d-glu or 25 mm l-glu media alone. Controls were incubated in media without additions. Then all samples were treated for 24 h with either 10 μm BBGC or 50% Me2SO in the presence of the appropriate glucose isomer or H2O. Measurement of NO· Concentration in HRP—Cell lysates were prepared as described for the glyoxalase I assay, except that the culture media from the cells was pooled with the trypsinized cells. After sonication and centrifugation, the samples were passed through 10-kDa cutoff filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Samples (125 μl) were treated with nitrate reductase to reduce nitrates to nitrite (36Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Twenty μl of Griess reagent (Griess reagent kit for nitrite determination, Invitrogen) was then added, and absorbance of the resulting azo compound was measured at 570 nm in a microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). The concentration was determined by comparison with a standard curve constructed from known standards of sodium nitrite. Statistical Analyses—All experiments were performed independently at least twice, with triplicate samples for each intervention within the experiment. Data were assessed for normal distribution and then compared by either Student's t test (parametric) or a Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Pericytes isolated from human retina by the procedure described were 90-95% positive for the purported pericyte markers, smooth muscle α-actin and NG-2 proteoglycan (Fig. 1). This procedure was used previously to isolate human retinal endothelial cells (33Grant M. Guay C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of endothelial growth factors in the culture medium allowed us to select for pericytes over endothelial cells. Our first experiments sought to determine whether incubation in a high glucose environment increased glyoxalase I activity in HRP. Glyoxalase I activity was assessed by measuring the product, S-d-lactoylglutathione. Control cell lysates had 1.64 units of glyoxalase I activity (Fig. 2A). The enzyme activities in cells incubated with either d-glu or l-glu (final concentration = 30 mm) were not significantly different from controls (Fig. 2A). To determine whether glyoxalase I protects HRP from apoptosis, we used BBGC, a competitive inhibitor of glyoxalase I. We first needed to confirm that BBGC inhibits the HRP glyoxalase I under our experimental conditions. We showed that incubation of HRP with BBGC results in a concentration-dependent increase in the un-metabolized substrate, MGO. Fig. 2B shows that MGO increases ∼4-fold compared with untreated controls at the highest concentration (200 μm) of BBGC. These data confirm inhibition of HRP glyoxalase I activity by BBGC, as determined by increased intracellular MGO. We confirmed that BBGC inhibited glyoxalase I in a second experiment. HRP cell lysates were incubated with de-esterified BBGC, the form required for its inhibitory capacity (37Creighton D.J. Zheng Z.-B. Holewinski R. Hamilton D.S. Eiseman J.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1378-1382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows that glyoxalase I activity in cell lysates incubated with de-esterified BBGC decreased ∼45% compared with lysates treated with esterase or BBGC alone. Because we found an increase in MGO with increasing concentrations of BBGC, we wanted to determine whether elevation of MGO caused pericyte apoptosis. We defined early apoptosis by quantifying cells that bind annexin V-fluoroisothiocyanate. In the process of early apoptosis, phosphatidylserine is exposed to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which then binds annexin V-fluoroisothiocyanate in the presence of Ca2+. Late apoptosis is defined by the binding of propidium iodide; this reagent intercalates with DNA only after permeabilization of the cell membrane. Treatment of HRP with BBGC results in a concentration-dependent increase in both early and late apoptosis (up to 50 μm, Fig. 3). Fifty μm BBGC appears to be the limit for early apoptosis (22%), with little increase at either 100 or 200 μm. However, 100 μm BBGC increased the late apoptotic population of HRP as much as 45% relative to the untreated control. Our results, thus, link inhibition of HRP glyoxalase I to pericyte apoptosis. To our knowledge this is the first report of such a correlation. We wanted to determine whether glyoxalase I contributes to pericyte dropout during diabetic retinopathy. Accordingly, we investigated whether a high glucose environment increased apoptosis in cultures of retinal pericytes and whether the addition of BBGC exacerbates this effect. A high glucose environment can elevate MGO in a number of tissues (38Thornalley P.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 1993; 14: 287-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), apparently by increasing the metabolic flux of glucose through the glycolytic pathway (38Thornalley P.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 1993; 14: 287-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) (which is the major route) and also through glucose autoxidation, degradation of Amadori products, acetone and threonine metabolism (a minor route). Experiments with HRP cultured for as long as 7 days in a high concentration of glucose (30 mm) failed to show statistically significant increases in early apoptosis relative to either the l-glu control or the untreated control (Fig. 4). We noted a statistically significant increase in late apoptosis compared with the l-glu control, but not the untreated control. A dramatic increase in both early and late apoptosis occurred when cells cultured in media containing 30 mm d-glu were also exposed to BBGC. Both early and late apoptosis increased in both the osmotic control co-incubated with BBGC (l-glu plus BBGC) and cells treated with BBGC alone, although not to the same degree as the d-glu plus BBGC samples (Fig. 4). These findings indicate that as long as glyoxalase I remains functional, HRP remain viable, even in a high glucose environment. However, once this enzyme is inhibited, apoptosis ensues. To address whether apoptosis was due to an elevation of intracellular MGO due to glyoxalase I blockade and additional synthesis of MGO as a result of the high glucose environment, we measured MGO levels in BBGC and d-glu-treated cells. After 7 days of culture in media containing 30 mm d-glu, the intracellular MGO of HRP increased relative to untreated controls (to 89 pmol of MGO/mg of protein). There was a slight but significant increase in MGO concentration in BBGC-treated cells ("
https://openalex.org/W2128725341,"Trypsin-mediated trypsinogen activation (autoactivation) facilitates digestive zymogen activation in the duodenum but may precipitate pancreatitis if it occurs prematurely in the pancreas. Autoactivation of human cationic trypsinogen is inhibited by a repulsive electrostatic interaction between the unique Asp218 on the surface of cationic trypsin and the conserved tetra-aspartate (Asp19-22) motif in the trypsinogen activation peptide (Nemoda, Z., and Sahin-Tóth, M. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 29645-29652). Here we describe that this interaction is regulated by chymotrypsin C (caldecrin), which can specifically cleave the Phe18-Asp19 peptide bond in the trypsinogen activation peptide and remove the N-terminal tripeptide. In contrast, chymotrypsin B, elastase 2A, or elastase 3A (proteinase E) are ineffective. Autoactivation of N-terminally truncated cationic trypsinogen is stimulated ∼3-fold, and this effect is dependent on the presence of Asp218. Because chymotrypsinogen C is activated by trypsin, and chymotrypsin C stimulates trypsinogen activation, these reactions establish a positive feedback mechanism in the digestive enzyme cascade of humans. Furthermore, inappropriate activation of chymotrypsinogen C in the pancreas may contribute to the development of pancreatitis. Consistent with this notion, the pancreatitis-associated mutation A16V in cationic trypsinogen increases the rate of chymotrypsin C-mediated processing of the activation peptide 4-fold and causes accelerated trypsinogen activation in vitro. Trypsin-mediated trypsinogen activation (autoactivation) facilitates digestive zymogen activation in the duodenum but may precipitate pancreatitis if it occurs prematurely in the pancreas. Autoactivation of human cationic trypsinogen is inhibited by a repulsive electrostatic interaction between the unique Asp218 on the surface of cationic trypsin and the conserved tetra-aspartate (Asp19-22) motif in the trypsinogen activation peptide (Nemoda, Z., and Sahin-Tóth, M. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 29645-29652). Here we describe that this interaction is regulated by chymotrypsin C (caldecrin), which can specifically cleave the Phe18-Asp19 peptide bond in the trypsinogen activation peptide and remove the N-terminal tripeptide. In contrast, chymotrypsin B, elastase 2A, or elastase 3A (proteinase E) are ineffective. Autoactivation of N-terminally truncated cationic trypsinogen is stimulated ∼3-fold, and this effect is dependent on the presence of Asp218. Because chymotrypsinogen C is activated by trypsin, and chymotrypsin C stimulates trypsinogen activation, these reactions establish a positive feedback mechanism in the digestive enzyme cascade of humans. Furthermore, inappropriate activation of chymotrypsinogen C in the pancreas may contribute to the development of pancreatitis. Consistent with this notion, the pancreatitis-associated mutation A16V in cationic trypsinogen increases the rate of chymotrypsin C-mediated processing of the activation peptide 4-fold and causes accelerated trypsinogen activation in vitro. The digestive enzyme cascade is a tightly regulated activation process of pancreatic zymogens in the duodenum. First, trypsinogen is activated to trypsin by enteropeptidase (enterokinase), and in turn, trypsin activates all other protease zymogens. Trypsin also activates trypsinogen, in a proteolytic reaction termed autoactivation, which is thought to have a physiological role in facilitating zymogen activation in the duodenum. However, the unique ability of trypsinogen to autoactivate renders this zymogen a potentially harmful disease-causing agent, since inappropriate autoactivation within the pancreas might initiate an autodigestive process and result in pancreatitis. The human pancreas produces three isoforms of trypsinogen encoded by separate genes, the PRSS1 (protease, serine 1), PRSS2, and PRSS3 genes (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Chen J.M. Ferec C. Cooper D.N. Nature Encyclopedia of the Human Genome. Macmillan, London2003: 645-650Google Scholar and references therein). On the basis of their relative isoelectric points and electrophoretic mobility, the iso(pro)enzymes are commonly referred to as cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1), anionic trypsinogen (PRSS2), and mesotrypsinogen (PRSS3). PRSS1 (∼60-70%) and PRSS2 (∼30-40%) account for the majority of trypsinogens in the pancreatic juice, whereas PRSS3 is secreted in relatively low amounts. Furthermore, this minor isoform exhibits defective inhibitor binding, and it cannot autoactivate or activate other protease zymogens (2Sahin-Tóth M. Protein Pept. Lett. 2005; 12: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The causative role of trypsinogen in pancreatitis is supported by the identification of mutations in the PRSS1 gene of patients with hereditary pancreatitis (3Whitcomb D.C. Gorry M.C. Preston R.A.

In contrast, genetic variants of PRSS2 or PRSS3 have not been described in association with chronic pancreatitis (8Chen J.M. Audrezet M.P. Mercier B. Quere I. Ferec C. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1999; 34: 831-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Three PRSS1 mutations, namely R122H (∼70%), N29I (∼25%), and A16V (∼4%), have been found with relatively high frequency in multiple families, whereas 18 additional genetic variants have been identified only in very few patients (for an up-to-date list, see the pancreatitis mutation data base on the World Wide Web at www.uni-leipzig.de/pancreasmutation). Biochemical analyses of the frequently found R122H and N29I mutations as well as a subset of rare mutations (D19A, D22G, K23R, N29T) indicated that the common phenotypic change in the pancreatitis-associated mutants is an increased propensity for autoactivation (9Sahin-Tóth M.

However, the third most frequently detected mutation, A16V, which alters the N-terminal amino acid of trypsinogen, has appeared to be an exception so far, because in a recent study, the A16V mutant failed to exhibit increased autoactivation (14Király O. Guan L. Szepessy E. Tóth M. Kukor Z. Sahin-Tóth M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 10.1016/j.pep.2006.01.023PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the conserved tetra-aspartate sequence (Asp19-22) in the trypsinogen activation peptide plays an essential role in suppressing autoactivation of human cationic trypsinogen (15Nemoda Z. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29645-29652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two inhibitory interactions were identified that employ the activation peptide: one between Asp22 and the conserved hydrophobic S2 subsite on trypsin and another between Asp21 and the unique Asp218, which forms part of the S3 subsite on trypsin. Together, these interactions can suppress the rate of autoactivation by more than 2 orders of magnitude. Interestingly, the inhibitory mechanism of autoactivation due to the Asp21-Asp218 interaction appears to be specific for human cationic trypsinogen, since Asp218 is rarely found in vertebrate trypsinogens, which mostly contain a Tyr residue at the corresponding position. Here we report that not only is this inhibitory interaction unique to humans, but it is also regulated by a novel mechanism, which involves proteolytic processing of the activation peptide by chymotrypsin C. Autoactivation of the N-terminally truncated cationic trypsinogen increases significantly, which can facilitate physiological zymogen activation in the duodenum, and may play a role in the precipitation of pancreatitis in carriers of the A16V cationic trypsinogen mutation. Nomenclature—The genetic abbreviations PRSS1 (protease, serine 1) and PRSS2 (protease, serine 2) are used to denote human cationic trypsinogen and anionic trypsinogen, respectively. Similarly, chymotrypsinogens B and C are abbreviated as CTRB and CTRC, and proelastase 2A and proelastase 3A are indicated as ELA2A and ELA3A. Note that chymotrypsin C is also known in the literature as caldecrin. Amino acid residues in the trypsinogen sequences are numbered according to their position in the native preproenzyme, starting with Met1. The first amino acid of the mature cationic trypsinogen is Ala16. The term “autoactivation” is used to describe trypsin-mediated trypsinogen activation. The intrinsic catalytic activity of trypsinogen is ∼108-fold lower than the activity of trypsin; therefore, its impact on trypsinogen activation is negligible in our experiments (16Pasternak A. Liu X. Lin T.Y. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16201-16210Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Human Pancreatic Juice Samples—Deidentified samples of pure human pancreatic juice were received in lyophilized form, as a kind gift from Dr. Niels Teich (University of Leipzig, Germany). The juice was collected from patients who underwent pancreas transplantation with bladder drainage of exocrine pancreatic secretions. To prevent zymogen activation, Trasylol (aprotinin) was added at the time of collection. See Ref. 17Keim V. Iovanna J.L. Orelle B. Verdier J.M. Busing M. Hopt U. Dagorn J.C.

Recombinant Trypsinogen Preparations—Because the routinely used recombinant trypsinogen preparations expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3) cells contain abnormal N termini (see below), in this study, recombinant trypsinogens were also made in the E. coli LG-3 strain and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 2The abbreviation used is: HEK, human embryonic kidney. 293T cells, which produce trypsinogens with homogenous, authentic N-terminal sequences. In the experiments, which analyze rates of chymotrypsin C-mediated N-terminal processing of cationic trypsinogen, recombinant preparations from LG-3 or HEK cells were used exclusively. On the other hand, we observed that N-terminal processing of trypsinogen preparations from E. coli Rosetta(DE3) cells is markedly accelerated. Therefore, these trypsinogen preparations proved to be valuable in experiments, which examined the effect of N-terminal processing. The source of the recombinant preparations used in the different experiments is clearly indicated in the figure legends. Purification of Native Protease Zymogens from Pancreatic Juice—Fifty mg of lyophilized pancreatic juice powder was solubilized with 1 ml of 10 mm HCl, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted with 3 ml of water and loaded onto a MonoQ anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Proteins were eluted with a 0-0.5 m NaCl gradient at a 1 ml/min flow rate, and 1 ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of fractions were subjected to trypsin and chymotrypsin activity assays before and after activation with enteropeptidase or trypsin, respectively. Briefly, a 10-μl fraction was mixed with 40 μl of assay buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2) and 150 μl of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide trypsin substrate or N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide chymotrypsin substrate, dissolved in assay buffer, was added to a final concentration of 0.14 and 0.15 mm, respectively. After recording the absorbance change at 405 nm for 1 min in a microplate reader, 0.032 nm recombinant human enteropeptidase (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or 10 nm cationic trypsin was added (final concentrations). After a 1-min (enteropeptidase) or 5-min (trypsin) incubation, the rate of p-nitroaniline release was measured again for 1 min. Zymogens were further purified from high activity fractions by ecotin affinity chromatography, as reported previously (18Lengyel Z. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Expression of Recombinant Protease Zymogens in the E. coli Rosetta (DE3) Strain—The pTrap-T7 expression plasmids harboring the PRSS1, PRSS2, and ELA2A genes were described earlier (9Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Note that in this expression plasmid, the sequence encoding the secretory signal peptide is deleted, and a codon for an initiator methionine is placed before the mature zymogen sequence. The PRSS1 D218Y and D218S mutants and the PRSS2 Y218D mutant were constructed previously (15Nemoda Z. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29645-29652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cDNA for CTRC was PCR-amplified from IMAGE clone 5221216 (GenBank™ accession number BI832476; this corresponds to the reported HC1 variant with Arg80 instead of Trp80) with the sense primer 5′-GCC TGT GCC ATG GCT TGT GGG GTG CCC AGC TTC CCG CCC AAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CCC AGC GTC GAC TCA CAG CTG CAT TTT CTC GTT GAT CC-3′. The sense primer introduces a Met-Ala sequence in place of the secretory signal peptide of CTRC. The cDNA for proelastase 3A (ELA3A) was PCR-amplified from IMAGE clone 3950453 (GenBank™ accession number BC007028), using the sense primer 5′-GCC GTT GCC ATG GCT GGC TAT GGC CCA CCT TCC TCT CAC TCT TCC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TTG GTT GTC GAC TTA GTG GCT TGC TAT GGT CTC CTC AAT CC-3′. The sense primer replaces the secretory signal peptide of ELA3A with a Met-Ala-Gly sequence, and the antisense primer changes the amber stop codon (TAG) to ochre (TAA). The CTRC and ELA3A PCR products were digested with NcoI and SalI restriction enzymes and cloned under the control of the T7 promoter in the pTrap-T7 expression plasmid. Recombinant protease zymogens were expressed in the E. coli Rosetta(DE3) strain as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Small scale expression and in vitro refolding of the zymogens was carried out as reported previously (9Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), except that 6 m guanidine-HCl was used to solubilize the proelastases and chymotrypsinogen C from inclusion bodies. Expression of Recombinant Human Cationic Trypsinogen with an Authentic N Terminus in the E. coli LG-3 Strain—Trypsinogens expressed from the pTrapT7 plasmid in E. coli Rosetta(DE3) contain a mixture of abnormal N termini, which consists of ∼70% Met-Ala16-Pro17-Phe18- and ∼30% Pro17-Phe18-sequences. Recently, we developed an E. coli expression system that was designed to produce recombinant trypsinogens with a homogenous, intact N-terminal sequence of Ala16-Pro17-Phe18-. The method involves the use of a self-splicing miniintein fused in frame with the N terminus of human cationic trypsinogen and a newly engineered E. coli strain deficient in aminopeptidase P, designated E. coli LG-3. Details of the construction of the intein-trypsinogen fusion construct and the LG-3 strain are described elsewhere (14Király O. Guan L. Szepessy E. Tóth M. Kukor Z. Sahin-Tóth M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 10.1016/j.pep.2006.01.023PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type cationic trypsinogen and mutants A16V, N29I, and R122H were expressed as intein fusions in the LG-3 strain. After C-terminal self-cleavage of the intein, trypsinogens with the native N terminus (Ala16-Pro17-Phe18-) accumulated in inclusion bodies. In vitro refolding and purification of trypsinogens was then carried out according to the protocol described previously (9Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Expression of Human Cationic Trypsinogen in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293T Cells—The PRSS1 cDNA was PCR-amplified from IMAGE clone 6217518 (GenBank™ accession CA778152) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1(-) plasmid using the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites. Mutation A16V was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and 4 mm l-glutamine. Cells were grown in the same medium but without penicillin before transfection in 75-cm2 flasks to 95% confluence. Transfections were carried out in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium with 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) using 32 μg of plasmid DNA and 80 μl of Lipofectamine 2000™ reagent (Invitrogen). After 5 h, the medium was supplemented with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum to a 10% final concentration. After 24 h, cells were washed with Opti-MEM containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 1 mm benzamidine and covered with 20 ml of the same medium. Conditioned medium was then harvested and replenished with fresh medium every other day for 10-12 days. Collected media were pooled (100-120 ml), and trypsinogens were purified by ecotin affinity chromatography (18Lengyel Z. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein Concentrations—Concentrations of the purified zymogen solutions were calculated from their UV absorbance at 280 nm, using the following theoretical extinction coefficients: PRSS1, 36,160 m-1 cm-1; PRSS2, 37,440 m-1 cm-1; ELA2A, 73,505 m-1 cm-1; ELA3A, 76,025 m-1 cm-1; CTRB, 47,605 m-1 cm-1 and CTRC, 64,565 m-1 cm-1. In mixed zymogen preparations purified from pancreatic juice, protein concentrations were estimated using the extinction coefficient of the predominant protease zymogen. Enzymatic Assays—Trypsin activity was measured with the synthetic chromogenic substrate, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (0.14 mm final concentration). Chymotrypsin activity was assessed by N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (0.15 mm final concentration). One-min time courses of p-nitroaniline release were followed at 405 nm in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, at room temperature using a Spectramax Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Autoactivation assays and calculation of initial rates using progress curve analysis with KINSIM and FITSIM computer programs (21Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal.

Chem. 2005; 280: 29645-29652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar. Autoactivation reactions contained 2 μm trypsinogen and were initiated by the addition of 10 nm trypsin (final concentrations). The initiating trypsin was always prepared from the corresponding trypsinogen preparation. The rate of N-terminal processing of trypsinogens by CTRC, CTRB, ELA3A, and ELA2A was measured using SDS-PAGE. Zymogens were activated in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm CaCl2 with 10 nm trypsin (final concentration). Trypsinogens (2 μm concentration) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of active proteases in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm benzamidine. Aliquots (100 μl) were withdrawn from the activation mixtures, and trypsinogen was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration). The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, and heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in the absence of a reducing agent. Electrophoretic separation was performed on 13% SDS-PAGE minigels in standard Tris-glycine buffer, and gels were stained with Brilliant Blue R. An N-terminally Processed Cationic Trypsinogen Variant in Pancreatic Juice Is Associated with Increased Autoactivation—We have isolated cationic and anionic trypsinogens from three deidentified human pancreatic juice samples (PS7, PS13, and PS19). Our aim was to compare properties of autoactivation of native human trypsinogens to those of recombinant trypsinogens produced in E. coli. Unexpectedly, autoactivation of cationic trypsinogen isolated from PS19 was significantly increased relative to cationic trypsinogen from PS7, PS13, or from E. coli, which were comparable. Fig. 1A demonstrates time courses of autoactivation at pH 8.0, and Fig. 1B shows the pH dependence of the rate of autoactivation between pH 4.0 and 8.0. The increased autoactivation of cationic trypsinogen from PS19 was detectable between pH 6.0 and 8.0 and showed a maximum at pH 7.0. In contrast, anionic trypsinogen isolated from PS19 autoactivated slower than anionic trypsinogen from PS7, PS13, or E. coli; however, the difference was not significant (see Fig. 1C for time courses at pH 8.0 and Fig. 1D for pH dependence). SDS-PAGE analysis of native and recombinant trypsinogens under reducing and nonreducing conditions revealed that native trypsinogens purified from PS19 are heterogeneous and exhibit two bands (Fig. 2). The doublet was best appreciated under nonreducing conditions in the 13% polyacrylamide gel used. The two cationic trypsinogen bands were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to Edman degradation, which yielded two distinct N-terminal sequences (Fig. 2). One of the sequences corresponded to the N terminus of intact, mature cationic trypsinogen starting with Ala16, whereas the other sequence showed a truncated N terminus, with the Ala16-Pro17-Phe18 tripeptide missing. N-terminal sequencing of the anionic trypsinogen doublet revealed the same proteolytic modification. Interestingly, the shortened N-terminal sequence was also observed by Guy et al. (23Guy O. Lombardo D. Bartelt D.C. Amic J. Figarella C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), when the N-terminal sequences of native human trypsinogens were first determined (23Guy O. Lombardo D. Bartelt D.C. Amic J. Figarella C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Clearly, a so far unidentified proteolytic activity in pancreatic juice cleaves off the N-terminal tripeptide of human trypsinogens. Remarkably, N-terminal processing stimulates autoactivation of cationic trypsinogen, whereas anionic trypsinogen remains largely unaffected.FIGURE 2N-terminal heterogeneity of trypsinogens purified from pancreatic juice PS19. Approximately 5 μg of native (N) or recombinant (R) trypsinogens were heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer either in the presence or absence of 100 mm dithiotreithol (DTT) and electrophoresed on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels. Gels were stained with Brilliant Blue R. Native trypsinogens exhibiting double bands were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. In addition to the native, intact sequence, a new truncated form was detected, with the N-terminal Ala16-Pro17-Phe18-tripeptide deleted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chymotrypsin C Activity Is Responsible for Stimulation of Autoactivation of Human Cationic Trypsinogen—The cleavage after Phe18 suggested that a chymotrypsin-like enzyme was responsible for the observed N-terminal processing of human trypsinogens. Therefore, we set out to identify this enzyme in human pancreatic juice. We based our experimental approach on the reasonable assumption that the unknown enzyme would cleave the synthetic chromogenic chymotrypsin substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, which is analogous to the N terminus of human trypsinogens in the P1-P2-P3 positions. Furthermore, it seemed likely that the unknown enzyme was present or activated in PS19, but not in PS7 and PS13, and thus comparative analysis of the three juices would be informative. The juice samples were loaded onto a MonoQ anion exchange column and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0-0.5 m). The flow-through and eluted fractions were collected and analyzed for the presence of chymotrypsin activity before and after incubation with low concentrations of trypsin, which was added to activate proenzymes. Trypsin activity was also measured in each fraction before and after activation of trypsinogens with enteropeptidase. Fig. 3 demonstrates the elution (UV absorbance at 280 nm) and enzyme activity profiles for all three juice samples. Before activation with trypsin, chymotrypsin activity was negligible in the PS7 and PS13 fractions but was clearly detectable in the flow-through and fractions 18 and 19 from PS19 (see orange trace in Fig. 3A). After activation with trypsin, three distinct chymotrypsin activity peaks emerged in all three juice samples, corresponding to the flow-through (peak I) and to fractions 14 and 15 (peak II) and fractions 18 and 19 (peak III). No spontaneous trypsin activity was observed in any of the chromatography fractions from the three juice samples. After activation with enteropeptidase, two trypsin activity peaks appeared, which represented cationic trypsinogen (fractions 24-26) and anionic trypsinogen (fractions 27-29). The presence of chymotrypsin activity in peak III of PS19 even without activation with trypsin, suggested that the chymotrypsin-like enzyme in peak III was responsible for the N-terminal processing of human trypsinogens. To investigate this notion, ecotin affinity chromatography was used to purify the putative chymotrypsinogens from peaks I-III. The purified proteins were electrophoresed on 13% minigels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to N-terminal protein sequencing. Peak II contained a single prominent band, which was identified as chymotrypsinogen B. Peak III exhibited three bands: an intense upper band corresponding to chymotrypsinogen C, a faint middle band that contained proelastase 3A, and a relatively weak lower band, which was chymotrypsinogen B. Finally, peak I purified from the MonoQ flow-through also contained all three bands, with chymotrypsinogen B as the predominant component (Fig. 4A). The chymotrypsinogen C band in peak III exhibited a fuzzy appearance on gels, suggesting that the protein might be glycosylated. Indeed, treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) resulted in a mobility shift on gels, whereas the mobility of chymotrypsinogen B was unaffected (not shown). The addition of trypsin also caused small but detectable mobility shifts for all proteins, indicating that the zymogens were activated by trypsin (not shown). Activity assays confirmed that trypsin-mediated activation resulted in the development of chymotrypsin activity in all three ecotin-affinity purified MonoQ peaks. To test the effect of the purified chymotrypsins on trypsinogen function, autoactivation of recombinant cationic trypsinogen was measured in the presence of proteins from peaks I-III. Clearly, peak III stimulated autoactivation to a significant extent, whereas peak I was only marginally active, and peak II was devoid of stimulatory activity (Fig. 4B). Efforts to purify chymotrypsinogen C completely free from the two small contaminating proteins (i.e. chymotrypsinogen B and proelastase 3A) present in peak III were unsuccessful; therefore, we expressed chymotrypsinogen C and proelastase 3A recombinantly in E. coli.

It also contains a heme cofactor to which carbon monoxide (CO) or nitric oxide can bind, resulting in enzyme inhibition. To understand the mechanism of this regulation, we have investigated the equilibria and kinetics of CO binding to the highly active catalytic core of CBS, which is dimeric. CBS exhibits strong anticooperativity in CO binding with successive association constants of 0.24 and 0.02 μm-1. Stopped flow measurements reveal slow CO association (0.0166 s-1) limited by dissociation of the endogenous ligand, Cys-52. Rebinding of CO and of Cys-52 following CO photodissociation were independently monitored via time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy. The Cys-52 rebinding rate, 4000 s-1, is essentially unchanged between pH 7.6 and 10.5, indicating that the pKa of Cys-52 is shifted below pH 7.6. This effect is attributed to the nearby Arg-266 residue, which is proposed to form a salt bridge with the dissociated Cys-52, thereby inhibiting its protonation and slowing rebinding to the Fe. This salt bridge suggests a pathway for enzyme inactivation upon CO binding, because Arg-266 is located on a helix that connects the heme and pyridoxal phosphate cofactor domains.

Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) 5The abbreviations used are: CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; CO, carbon monoxide; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; CBS(5c), one or both hemes are five-coordinate; CBS-CO, CO bound to both hemes; Fe(II)-CBS, heme with reduced Fe and Cys side chain bound to both the hemes. 5The abbreviations used are: CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; CO, carbon monoxide; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; CBS(5c), one or both hemes are five-coordinate; CBS-CO, CO bound to both hemes; Fe(II)-CBS, heme with reduced Fe and Cys side chain bound to both the hemes. is a key enzyme in the regulation of homocysteine in humans (1Banerjee R. Zou C.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2Miles E.W. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29871-29874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Mutations in CBS are the most common cause of hereditary homocystinuria, in which elevated plasma homocysteine levels are associated with a range of pathologies, including mental retardation and cardiovascular disease (3Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovby F. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1279-1328Google Scholar). CBS is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine with serine to give cystathionine. In addition to the PLP cofactor, human CBS contains a heme group. The heme is not required for enzyme activity and is absent in CBS produced by yeast and protozoa (4Evande R. Ojha S. Banerjee R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 427: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A fragment of the human enzyme in which the 69-residue N-terminal region is deleted no longer binds heme but retains ∼40% activity (4Evande R. Ojha S. Banerjee R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 427: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the heme can play a regulatory role; the Fe(II) form of the enzyme is inhibited upon binding CO or nitric oxide (5Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Taoka S. Banerjee R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 87: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), whereas activity is doubled when the Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) (7Taoka S. Ojha S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The redox state of the heme is pH dependent, with reoxidation of Fe(II)-CBS to Fe(III)-CBS being favored at low pH conditions (8Pazicni S. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Oliveriusova J. Rees K.A. Parks R.B. Clark R.W. Rodgers K.R. Kraus J.P. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14684-14695Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the physiological implications of this regulatory behavior in CBS are uncertain, this protein joins the growing list of heme sensor proteins in which enzymatic or DNA binding activity is controlled by the ligation or redox status of the heme. In addition to the N-terminal heme-binding domain, CBS has a C-terminal inhibitory domain; the inhibition is lifted upon binding of another regulatory molecule, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (9Janosik M. Kery V. Gaustadnes M. Maclean K.N. Kraus J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10625-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Evande R. Blom H. Boers G.H.J. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11832-11837Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Truncation of the AdoMet-binding domain leaves a fully active catalytic core that is less prone to aggregation than the full-length enzyme and is useful for spectroscopic and mechanistic studies (11Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Catalysis is inhibited by CO binding, as in the full-length protein. The truncated protein in which the last 143 residues of the C-terminal domain have been deleted (CBS-Δ143) is dimeric (whereas the full-length protein forms tetramers and higher oligomers). The crystal structure of the catalytic core has revealed the arrangement of the heme- and PLP-binding domains, which are ∼20 Å apart (Fig. 1) (12Meier M. Oliveriusova J. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1647: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Taoka S. Lepore B.W. Kabil Ö. Ojha S. Ringe D. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10454-10461Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated CO binding to truncated CBS with the aim of elucidating the mechanism of regulation by this gas. Our principal findings are that the dimer displays equilibrium anticooperativity in CO binding, that the rate of CO binding is controlled by pre-dissociation of the endogenous Cys-52 ligand, and that rebinding of Cys-52 is relatively slow and independent of pH, between 7.6 and 10.5, implying a perturbed pKa for the dissociated Cys-52. These results support a model in which interaction between the heme and PLP cofactors is mediated by a hydrogen bond between Cys-52 and the Arg-266 residue, which is connected via an intervening helix to the PLP binding site. Enzyme Purification and CO Equilibrium Constant Measurements— The truncated dimer, CBS-ΔC143, was purified as described previously (11Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The binding constants for CO for the truncated enzyme were determined exactly as described for the full-length enzyme (5Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation—For Raman spectroscopy, aliquots of Fe(III)-CBS protein were transferred to NMR tubes and diluted using specified buffers to achieve a typical concentration of 25 μm in heme. The tubes were sealed with rubber septa and parafilm and purged with high purity nitrogen gas for 2 h. Sodium dithionite was added to reduce the iron to the Fe(II) form under anaerobic conditions. To prepare the CO-bound form of CBS following the reduction step above, the samples were immediately purged with CO for 3-5 min. For the rapid mixing experiments, Fe(II)-CBS for the stopped flow experiments was prepared with the same procedure as for Raman experiments. The final concentration was 14 μm before mixing. CO-saturated buffers for use in rapid mixing experiments were prepared by first degassing with alternate application of vacuum and N2 flushing followed by 2 h of CO purging. Solutions saturated with CO are 1 mm in dissolved CO. Buffer with lower concentrations of CO was obtained by mixing the CO-saturated buffer with an appropriate volume of N2-saturated buffer. The buffers used were phosphate at pH 7.6, Tris at pH 8.6, and glycine-NaOH at pH 10.6. These latter two pH values were above those at which significant anaerobic reoxidation of Fe(II)-CBS has been observed; the reoxidation of Fe(II)-CBS is slow at pH 7.6 (8Pazicni S. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Oliveriusova J. Rees K.A. Parks R.B. Clark R.W. Rodgers K.R. Kraus J.P. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14684-14695Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and so did not interfere in the conversion to the CO adduct, which was stable. Stopped Flow Measurements of CO Association Rates—A solution of CBS (75 μl, 14 μm) in buffer (Tris, pH 8.6) was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of buffer solution (Tris, pH 8.6) containing dissolved CO using a stopped flow instrument (HI-TECH Scientific SF-61 DX2 Double Mixing Stopped Flow System) with a diode array detector. The concentration of CO was varied by dilution of CO-saturated buffer (1.0 mm). A total of 300 scans were acquired over a period of 4500 s. The spectral range observed was from 300 to 700 nm. All reactions were carried out at 24.5 ± 1 °C. Global analysis of the time-dependent changes in the spectra was carried out using MATLAB v.7.0.4 on the data from 380 to 650 nm. Time-resolved Resonance Raman Measurements of Photorecombination—The set-up has been described in detail previously (14Zhao X.J. Chen R.P. Tengroth C. Spiro T.G. Appl. Spectrosc. 1999; 53: 1200-1205Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Zhao X. Balakrishnan G. Moore E.G. Spiro T.G. J. Raman Spectrosc. 2000; 31: 349-352Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The second harmonic of a Q-switched Nd:YLF laser (Photonics International GM-30-527) was used to pump a Ti:sapphire laser (Photonics International TU-UV) that gave a narrowed laser frequency output (<0.1 cm-1) tunable between 810 and 920 nm. The Ti:S laser output (∼25 ns at 1 kHz) was frequency doubled using a non-linear LBO crystal to obtain pump pulses at 419 nm. Probe laser pulses at 426 nm were generated by a second Ti:S laser with the same characteristics. The optimum pump laser power to achieve maximum photolysis (i.e. no further increase in the intensity of the ν4 resonance Raman band of the five-coordinate heme at the earliest time) was 140 milliwatt. Photolysis from the probe laser was minimized by keeping its power at ∼1.0 milliwatt. The time delay between pump and probe pulses (0.20-300 μs) was controlled by a DG535 delay generator. The sample solution in an NMR tube was spun for efficient mixing of the sample. Spinning ensured that the volume sampled was replaced between probe pulses and that there was no permanent product formation. The pump and probe beams were spatially overlapped and then focused onto the sample with a pair of cylindrical lenses. The scattered light was collected and focused onto a single spectrograph (SPEX 1269, 3600 grooves/mm) equipped with a gated intensified photo diode array detector. Ten scans, each of 30-s acquisition time, were averaged. Spectra were calibrated with N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, and methylcyclohexane. Spectral deconvolution was carried out with the GRAMS/AI v.7.00 software. Parameters for curve fitting included use of a mixed Gaussian/Lorentzian (1:9) band shape and the incorporation of fixed bandwidths: 9 cm-1 (1372 cm-1); 12 cm-1 (1354 cm-1); and 11 cm-1 (1361 cm-1). The spectra were divided by control spectra, obtained by reversing the order of the pump and probe pulses, to compensate for any slow changes in sample composition. Measurement of Relative Raman Cross-sections—Relative Raman cross-sections were determined in two ways. In one experiment, samples of Fe(II)-CBS and of its CO adduct were made at the same concentration, and spectra were recorded under identical conditions. The laser power at the sample was 0.2 milliwatt. Measured intensities of the ν4 band were used to obtain the relative cross-sections. To obtain cross-section of CBS(5c) relative to CBS-CO, the laser intensity was increased stepwise to cause different amounts of photolysis. The intensities of ν4 were then used to calculate the relative cross-section using a linear least squares procedure under the constraint that total heme concentration is constant. In another experiment, CBS was reduced under nitrogen atmosphere and the spectrum of Fe(II)-CBS was recorded. Following this, the sample solution was kept under 1 atm CO for 2 h. CO binding was monitored by recording the absorption spectrum periodically. When CO binding was complete, the Raman spectrum of CBS-CO was recorded. In both experiments, intensities were determined by deconvolution of the spectrum in the ν4 region into three bands at 1354, 1361, and 1372 cm-1 as described above for the TR3 measurements. Equilibrium Constants for CO Binding—Equilibrium dissociation constants were measured by titration of Fe(II)-CBS with CO (not shown). Two dissociation constants were obtained: 3.9(2.0) μm and 50 (8Pazicni S. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Oliveriusova J. Rees K.A. Parks R.B. Clark R.W. Rodgers K.R. Kraus J.P. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14684-14695Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) μm, which are similar to those reported for wild-type human CBS, 1.5(0.1) μm and 68 (14Zhao X.J. Chen R.P. Tengroth C. Spiro T.G. Appl. Spectrosc. 1999; 53: 1200-1205Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) μm (5Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, CO binding to one subunit reduces the CO binding affinity of the second subunit. CO Association Rates—Fig. 2 shows the spectra at various times after mixing CO with Fe(II)-CBS in the stopped flow apparatus. The heme Soret band shifts from 449 nm in Fe(II)-CBS to 419 nm in the CO adduct. However, a side reaction was discovered, which we attribute to a small amount of O2 in the Fe(III)-CBS solution prior to dithionite addition. When the O2 was allowed to increase, complete bleaching of the 449 nm Fe(II)-CBS absorption band was observed, and yet subsequent addition of CO led to complete recovery of the 419 nm Fe(II)-CBS-CO absorption band (supplemental Fig. S1). Presumably, radical species resulting from the reaction of O2 with dithionite attack the Fe(II)-CBS heme, but the nature of the product, which reverts back to the normal CO adduct, is currently a puzzle. The extent of bleaching could be reduced, but not eliminated, by a freeze-pump-thaw cycle on the Fe(III)-CBS solution. In the stopped flow experiments, the extent of bleaching was minor, but somewhat variable, and produced an extraneous rapid initial increase in the 419-nm absorbance due to CO reaction with the bleach product. To eliminate the influence of this artifact on the course of the CO binding to authentic Fe(II)-CBS, we applied global analysis to extract the spectral component that changed over time because of the binding of CO to Fe(II)-CBS (Fig. 3a). The kinetics of the change in this spectral component (Fig. 3b) could be fit to two successive exponentials with the fast phase having a much larger amplitude, on average four times greater, than the slow phase (supplemental Table S1). The successive pseudo-first-order rate constants, kobs (Table 1), differ by an order of magnitude. The fast phase was [CO] dependent and increased non-linearly with [CO], showing saturation behavior (Fig. 4). This is the behavior expected when the rate of CO association is limited by the prior dissociation of an endogenous ligand (Cys-52 in the case of CBS) (18Puranik M. Nielsen S.B. Youn H. Hvitved A.N. Bourassa J.L. Case M.A. Tengroth C. Balakrishnan G. Thorsteinsson M.V. Groves J.T. McLendon G.L. Roberts G.P. Olson J.S. Spiro T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21096-21108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The kinetic scheme, illustrated in Fig. 5, leads to Equation 1. kobs≈k-cyskCO[CO]kcys+kCO'[CO]=k-cys[CO]kcys/kCO'+[CO](Eq. 1) when CO dissociation is much slower than binding, k-CO << k′CO[CO], and when Cys-52 dissociation is much slower than rebinding of either ligand, k-cys << kcys + k′CO[CO] (16Trent J.T. II I Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6155-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The CO saturation limit gives the Cys-52 dissociation rate constant, k-cys, whereas the curvature is determined by the ligand rebinding rate ratio, kcys/k′CO. The fitting of Equation 1 to the data for kobs1 in Fig. 4 gives k-cys = 0.0166 (8Pazicni S. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Oliveriusova J. Rees K.A. Parks R.B. Clark R.W. Rodgers K.R. Kraus J.P. Burstyn J.N.

An independent estimate of the latter is available from flash photolyis (see next paragraph). The slow phase of the CO binding was [CO] independent and had a much smaller amplitude than the fast phase. We attribute it to a subpopulation of Fe(II)-CBS molecules that are unable to bind CO, perhaps because the Cys-52 ligand is not primed to dissociate (see “Discussion”) and requires a conformation change to do so. This conformation change is slow, occurring in hours (kobs2 ∼0.0011 s-1, Table 1).TABLE 1Apparent rate constants for CO association with CBS observed in stopped flow experiments at various concentrations of CO[CO]kobs1kobs2μMs–15000.0133(3)aStandard errors with significant figures of the last decimal place are given in parentheses0.00107(4)3000.0127(2)0.00104(4)2000.0106(2)0.00127(6)1250.0087(2)0.00121(6)a Standard errors with significant figures of the last decimal place are given in parentheses Open table in a new tab FIGURE 5Kinetic scheme for ligand replacement in CBS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ligand Rebinding after Flash Photolysis—Resonance Raman spectroscopy was used to assess rebinding rates for CO and Cys-52 after flash photolysis of the CO adduct, at equilibrium with 1 mm CO. The ν4 heme resonance Raman band has distinguishable positions for the native protein (bound Cys-52), 1361 cm-1, the CO adduct, 1372 cm-1, and the five-coordinate (5c) heme intermediate, 1354 cm-1. Fig. 6 shows the time evolution of the ν4 band envelope at different delay times between pump (419 nm) and probe (426 nm) lasers. Deconvolution of this envelope into the three components is illustrated for the 200-ns delay spectrum. The deconvoluted band areas were converted to concentrations after determining the relative cross-sections. Comparison of pure solutions of CBS and the CO adduct revealed the ν4 cross-sections to be the same at 426 nm. The cross-section of the five-coordinate heme photoproduct was found to be 1.7-fold larger, via a least squares fit of the intensities under the constraint of constant heme concentration. Fig. 7 shows the time evolution of the relative fractions of CBS-CO, CBS(5c), and Fe(II)-CBS. The intensities were corrected for probe laser photolysis by subtraction of the probe-only spectrum and normalization with respect to the probe-only intensity of the CBS-CO band. Nearly 70% of the photolyzed CO recombines geminately, so that the initial fraction of CBS(5c) is ∼30%. This intermediate decays and is replaced by CBS-CO and by Fe(II)-CBS, but the former grows faster than the latter. The data are well described by single exponentials, with time constants of 45 (15Zhao X. Balakrishnan G. Moore E.G. Spiro T.G. J. Raman Spectrosc. 2000; 31: 349-352Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and 55 (12Meier M. Oliveriusova J. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. Biochim. Biophys.

The formation rate for the slowly evolving Fe(II)-CBS is best determined from the rate difference between CBS(5c) decay and CBS-CO formation as shown in Equation 2. k5c,obs=kCO'[CO]+kcys(Eq. 2) The derived Fe(II)-CBS rate constants are the same within experimental error for all these pH values (Table 2).TABLE 2Rate constants (s-1) from the pump-probe Raman spectroscopy of CBS-CO photolysisPHCBS-5cCBS-COCBS-Cys (calc)7.61.8 (0.3)aStandard errors with significant figures of the last decimal place are given in parentheses × 1041.32 (0.16) × 1044.

Because geminate recombination accounts for 70% of the heme, we cannot exclude the possibility that the kinetic traces are monitoring only one of the two hemes in the CBS dimer However, the kcys/k′CO ratio obtained from the rebinding data, 220 (170) μm at pH 8.6, is within experimental error of the value determined from the stopped flow CO binding experiment. Thus, the same elementary rates are monitored in the two experiments, one starting with Fe(II)-CBS and the other with Fe(II)-CBS-CO, suggesting equal rates for the two hemes.

Recently investigated proteins of this class include rice hemoglobin, rHb1 (20Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), in which CO replaces an endogenous histidine, and the gene activator protein CooA (17Springer B.A. Silgar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (721) Google Scholar) from the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum, in which CO replaces the N-terminal amine group, which belongs to a proline residue. As might be expected, the exogenous ligand affinity is diminished by the binding affinity of the endogenous ligand. Thus, the equilibrium constant for CO association is much lower for these proteins than it is for myoglobin, for which values in the range of 27-41 μm-1 are reported (17Springer B.A. Silgar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In CooA, a dimeric protein showing positive cooperativity, successive equilibrium constants are 0.17 and 1.25 μm-1 for the first and second binding steps, with a geometric mean of 0.46 μm-1 (18Puranik M. Nielsen S.B. Youn H. Hvitved A.N. Bourassa J.L. Case M.A. Tengroth C. Balakrishnan G. Thorsteinsson M.V. Groves J.T. McLendon G.L. Roberts G.P. Olson J.S. Spiro T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21096-21108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The affinity is even lower for CBS; the equilibrium constants are 0.25 and 0.02 μm-1 for the first and second binding steps, with a geometric mean of 0.07 μm-1. The lower mean value may reflect the extra energy required to displace an anionic ligand relative to a neutral one. Likewise, the rate constant for endogenous ligand dissociation is lower for CBS, 0.0166 s-1, compared with 0.2 and 0.07 s-1 for CooA and 1900 s-1 for rHb1. The recombination rate of the endogenous ligand is faster for CBS than for rHb1, 4000 versus 500 s-1, again as might be expected for an anionic ligand attacking the positively charged Fe(II). For CooA, two rates are deduced from the requirement for cooperative CO binding, 4000 and 84 s-1, which bracket the rHb1 value; the faster rate is the same as the value for CBS. The equilibrium constant for Cys-52 association in CBS is calculated from the forward and reverse rate constants to be 2.4 × 105. This is much larger than the Pro association constants derived for CooA, 20,000 and 1,200, and nearly a million times larger than the His association constant in rHb1, 0.27. On the other hand, the rate of CO rebinding to the five-coordinate photoproduct for CBS, 18 μm-1 s-1, is between the rates for rHb1 (6μm-1 s-1) and CooA (32 μm-1s -1). Thus, the dynamical differences among these three six-coordinate heme proteins lie in the nature of the endogenous ligand being replaced. In contrast to CooA, the equilibrium binding of CO is anti-cooperative for CBS. However, there is no evidence for kinetic inequivalence between the two binding sites of the dimer, either in CO association to Fe(II)-CBS or in CO rebinding to photolysed Fe(II)-CBS-CO. The inequivalent equilibrium constants must therefore stem from inequivalent CO dissociation rates, which have not been measured in this study. The CO dissociation rate must diminish for the second heme when the first heme loses CO, perhaps due to an allosteric change that limits egress of CO from the heme pocket. Mechanism of Enzyme Regulation—The heme group in CBS is 20 Å distant from the PLP active site, yet enzyme activity is diminished 1.7-fold when Fe(III) heme is reduced to Fe(II) (7Taoka S. Ojha S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and is abolished altogether by CO binding to the heme (5Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). An allosteric mechanism is presumed to be responsible for this regulatory behavior. Helix 8 separates the heme and PLP sites (Fig. 8) and is a likely candidate for an allosteric element. It has been noted that this helix supports Thr-257 and Thr-260 on the PLP side and Arg-266 on the heme side (4Evande R. Ojha S. Banerjee R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 427: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The two threonine residues donate hydrogen bonds to the PLP phosphate group, whereas Arg-266 donates an H-bond to the Cys-52 ligand. Thus the Arg-266-Thr-257/260 segment may act as a lever between the heme and the PLP site, modulating the activity of the latter via mechanical tension that is mediated by the hydrogen bonds at either end. An important finding in this connection is the absence of any significant pH effect on the photodissociation dynamics. Essentially the same rebinding rates are observed when the solution pH ranges from 7.6 to 10.5 (Table 2). It might have been expected that the Cys-52 thiolate would be subject to protonation after it is displaced by CO. The thiolate pKa is ∼8.8 in aqueous solution (21Kortemme T. Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). If the displaced Cys-52 were protonated at pH 7.6, its recombination rate should have slowed substantially relative to pH 10.5, but this did not happen. We conclude that Cys-52 remains unprotonated and that its pKa is shifted below 7.6 by interactions in the binding pocket. The obvious interaction is the hydrogen bond with Arg-266, which can convert to a salt bridge when the Cys-52 thiolate anion is displaced from the positive Fe(II). This interaction can explain the otherwise surprising fact that it is the anionic Cys-52 ligand that is displaced by CO, rather than the neutral His-65 ligand on the other side of the heme. The Cys-52 thiolate is primed for displacement by the availability of a salt bridge interaction. We speculate that the slow conformation change, represented by the low amplitude [CO]-independent phase of the stopped flow kinetics (above), arises from a subpopulation of Fe(II)-CBS molecules in which Arg-266 is misoriented for H-bonding to Cys-52, which is therefore resistant to displacement by CO. The salt bridge could account for enzyme inhibition if its formation reorients the Arg-266 side chain and, with it, the Arg-266-Thr-257/260 lever. The resulting movement of Thr-257 and Thr-260, which are anchored to the PLP phosphate group, may misalign the pyridoxal end of the PLP, interfering with an optimal geometry for catalysis. It is possible that a more subtle shift of the Arg-266-Thr-257/260 lever could also account for the 1.7-fold reduction in activity between Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms of the heme. The Arg-266-Cys-52 H-bond is expected to weaken significantly when Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III), because of the reduced negative charge. This weakening could shift the Arg-266-Thr-257/260 lever slightly, inducing a suboptimal alignment of the PLP. Thus the proposed allosteric mechanism could account for heme regulation of PLP activity by both redox and ligand displacement processes. Physiological Implications—Does CO binding regulate CBS activity in vivo? This is quite possible because the reported range of physiologically relevant CO concentrations, 3-30 μm (19Ingi T. Chiang G. Ronnett G.V. J. Neurosci. 1996; 15: 5621-5628Crossref Google Scholar), is bracketed by the two dissociation constants of human CBS, 1.5 and 68 μm (5Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) of full-length human CBS, implying that the reduced enzyme is normally half-saturated with CO. It has also been suggested that heme redox state is a regulator of CBS (7Taoka S. Ojha S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) because the activity doubles when the reduced form is oxidized to Fe(III)-CBS. The two effects are not mutually exclusive, because the reduction potential of Fe(III)-CBS would be raised by CO binding to Fe(II)-CBS. The physiologically relevant active and inactive states might be Fe(III)-CBS on the one hand and Fe(II)-CBS-CO on the other. The relatively slow rate of CO binding complicates the issue. At 10 μm CO, the half-time for CO binding is expected to be 500 s from the present data on the truncated protein, and it may be affected by interactions with other proteins or with effector molecules in vivo. However, a slow binding rate might act as a filter to avoid unproductive responses to transient changes in local CO levels, as has been suggested for CooA (18Puranik M. Nielsen S.B. Youn H.

Despite extensive biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies, the mechanism by which helicase unwinds double-stranded DNA remains to be elucidated. Using a wide array of biochemical and biophysical approaches, we have previously shown that the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase functions as a monomer. In this study, we have further characterized the kinetic mechanism of the RecQ-catalyzed unwinding of duplex DNA using the fluorometric stopped-flow method based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Our results show that RecQ helicase binds preferentially to 3′-flanking duplex DNA. Under the pre-steady-state conditions, the burst amplitude reveals a 1:1 ratio between RecQ and DNA substrate, suggesting that an active monomeric form of RecQ helicase is involved in the catalysis. Under the single-turnover conditions, the RecQ-catalyzed unwinding is independent of the 3′-tail length, indicating that functional interactions between RecQ molecules are not implicated in the DNA unwinding. It was further determined that RecQ unwinds DNA rapidly with a step size of 4 bp and a rate of ∼21 steps/s. These kinetic results not only further support our previous conclusion that E. coli RecQ functions as a monomer but also suggest that some of the Superfamily 2 helicases may function through an “inchworm” mechanism.

Helicases are molecular motor proteins that use the energy of nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis to translocate along and separate the complementary strands of a nucleic acid duplex. These enzymes play essential roles in most aspects of the DNA metabolic pathway, such as replication, repair, recombination, and transcription (1Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev.

A large number of helicases have been identified; however, the mechanisms by which helicases unwind double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 3The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s). remain obscure. One of the major concerns in studying the unwinding mechanism of a DNA helicase is its oligomeric state. This is because an oligomeric structure could provide multiple potential binding sites for the DNA substrate and nucleotide cofactors, which are absolutely required for the helicase to translocate along the DNA track during the processive DNA unwinding. Indeed, the biochemical and structural studies have shown that some helicases assemble into stable cooperative hexameric rings (3Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). These helicases include the Escherichia coli DnaB (6San Martin M.C. Stamford N.P.J. Dammerova N. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. J.

For the non-ring helicases, the enzymes could be assembled into oligomers, and the DNA binding sites may be located on the separate subunits. On the basis of quantitative analyses of DNA binding properties, a “rolling model” was proposed to explain factorial DNA unwinding (15Wong I. Lohman T.M. Science. 1992; 256: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This model suggests that each monomer of the Rep dimer binds alternatively to ssDNA and dsDNA. This process is regulated by repeated binding and hydrolysis of ATP and release of ADP. In this way, Rep dimer rolls along the DNA with translocation coupled to ATP binding and DNA unwinding coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Kinetic studies have shown that both Rep (16Bjornson K.P.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) have revealed that these helicases are in the monomeric forms. It is important to use other biochemical and biophysical methods to examine the oligomeric state of a helicase in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism by which the helicase unwinds duplex DNA. In this study, we focus on the kinetic DNA-unwinding mechanism and active oligomeric state of the E. coli RecQ, a Superfamily 2 helicase. The RecQ family proteins are the conserved helicase enzymes involved in several aspects of DNA metabolism (37van Brabant A.J. Stan R. Ellis N.A. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2000; 1: 409-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 38Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Three of human RecQ helicases, WRN (39Yu C. Oshima J. Fu Y. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Najura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenbrg G.D.

Genet. 1999; 22: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), are associated with human genetic diseases, Werner, Bloom, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes, respectively. The E. coli RecQ, composed of 610 amino acids, is the prototype helicase of this family. The DNA unwinding studies of this enzyme have shown that the unwinding amplitude displays a sigmoidal dependence on ATP concentration with a Hill number of 3.3 (42Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 232-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This observation has been taken as an argument that RecQ functions as a hexamer. However, we have previously shown that the RecQ helicase functions as a monomer (29Xu H.Q. Deprez E. Zhang A.H. Tauc P. Ladjimi M.M. Brochon J.C. Auclair C. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34925-34933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), using an array of biochemical and biophysical approaches. Our studies employed size exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, and functional analysis. Our conclusion is consistent with the crystal structure of the RecQ in the apo form (36Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, several questions related to the oligomeric state of the active RecQ helicase remain to be addressed. First, the oligomer states could be transient in nature or unstable to be detected by these approaches. Second, the crystal structure of RecQ was obtained with the C-terminal truncated protein, in the absence of a DNA substrate (36Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of the truncated protein in the absence of DNA could be different from that of the full-length protein in the presence of DNA. Furthermore, the full-length BLM (43Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and the exonuclease domain of WRN (44Xue Y. Ratcliff G.C. Wang H. Davis-Searles P.R. Gray M.D. Erie D.A. Redinbo M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2901-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) form oligomeric ringlike structures in solution, revealed by electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, respectively. As the RecQ family helicases are highly conserved in sequence and in function, it is therefore possible that the RecQ helicase could also function as a hexamer in solution. In this study, we resorted to the rapid stopped-flow fluorescence assays that were based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer, allowing the continuous and real time observations of the DNA unwinding (16Bjornson K.P. Amaratunga M. Moore K.J. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14306-14316Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 45Zhang X.-D. Dou S.-X. Xie P. Wang P.-Y. Xi X.G. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2005; 37: 593-600Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). By taking advantage of these approaches, the RecQ-mediated DNA unwinding kinetics was analyzed under both pre-steady-state and single-turnover DNA unwinding conditions. Our results support our previous conclusion that RecQ is a monomeric DNA helicase. Reagents and Buffers—All chemicals were reagent grade, and all buffers were prepared in high quality deionized water from a Milli-Q® ultra-pure water purification system (Millipore) having resistivity greater than 18.2 megaohms·cm. All unwinding reactions and DNA binding assays were performed in buffers containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol unless noted elsewhere. ATP was from Sigma and dissolved as a concentrated stock at pH 7.0. ATP concentration was determined by using an extinction coefficient at 259 nm of 1.54 × 104 cm-1 m-1. RecQ Protein—His6-tagged E. coli RecQ helicase was expressed from pET 15b expression plasmid in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as described previously (29Xu H.Q. Deprez E. Zhang A.H. Tauc P. Ladjimi M.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RecQ protein was purified to >95% homogeneity, and the concentration was quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.48 × 104 cm-1 m-1 (47Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was also determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The protein concentrations reported in this study represent the average values determined by both methods mentioned above. The purified E. coli RecQ protein was stored in storage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) at -80 °C. Oligonucleotide Reaction Substrates—The DNA substrates used in the unwinding assays have both strands labeled with fluorescein and hexachlorofluorescein, respectively, whereas those used in the DNA binding assays have only one strand labeled with fluorescein. Their structures and sequences, similar to those in our previous studies (46Xu H.Q. Zhang A.H. Auclair C. Xi X.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), are shown in Table 1. The protein trap used for single-turnover kinetic experiments was 56-nt poly(dT), dT56. Single-stranded oligonucleotides, with or without fluorescent labels, were purchased from SBS Genetech Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China), and all synthetic oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before storage in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA at -20 °C. Concentrations of single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically based on extinction coefficients calculated by the nearest neighbor method. A 50μm working stock of dsDNA was prepared by mixing equal concentrations of complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5 at 25 °C) containing 100 mm NaCl, followed by heating to 85 °C. After equilibrating for 5 min, annealing was allowed by slow cooling to room temperature. The duplex was stored at -20 °C. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the oligonucleotide hybridization, the 3′-fluorescein-labeled ssDNA was further labeled with 32Patits5′-end. The hybridization was then performed under the same conditions as above. The resulting dsDNA and ssDNA were separated by native gel and further quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. The results showed that the quantity of ssDNA represents 0.5-2%.TABLE 1Substrates used in DNA binding and unwinding assaysSubstrateStructure and sequence16-bp duplex with 3′-ssDNA tail3′-F-TTAGGCAGCTCGTCTC-5′aF, fluorescein5′-H-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAG(dTn)-3′bH, hexachlorofluorescein16-bp duplex with 5′-ssDNA tail5′-F-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAG-3′3′-TTAGGCAGCTCGTCTC(dTn)-5′12-bp duplex with 10-nt 3′-ssDNA tail3′-F-GCAGCTCGTCTC-5′5′-H-CGTCGAGCAGAG(dT10)-3′20-bp duplex with 10-nt 3′-ssDNA tail3′-F-CGGAGCGACGGCAGCGGTTT-5′5′-H-GCCTCGCTGCCGTCGCCAAA(dT10)-3′25-bp duplex with 10-nt 3′-ssDNA tail3′-F-CGGAGCGACGGCAGCGGTTTGCTTC-5′5′-H-GCCTCGCTGCCGTCGCCAAACGAAG(dT10)-3′30-bp duplex with 10-nt 3′-ssDNA tail3′-F-CGGAGCGACGGCAGCGGTTTGCTTCCAATG-5′5′-H-GCCTCGCTGCCGTCGCCAAACGAAGGTTAC(dT10)-3′35-bp duplex with 10-nt 3′-ssDNA tail3′-F-CGGAGCGACGGCAGCGGTTTGCTTCCAATGTAAGG-5′5′-H-GCCTCGCTGCCGTCGCCAAACGAAGGTTACATTCC(dT10)-3′40-bp duplex with 10-nt 3′-ssDNA tail3′-F-CGGAGCGACGGCAGCGGTTTGCTTCCAATGTAAGGGCGAC-5′5′-H-GCCTCGCTGCCGTCGCCAAACGAAGGTTACATTCCCGCTG(dT10)-3′a F, fluoresceinb H, hexachlorofluorescein Open table in a new tab Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—DNA Binding of RecQ was analyzed by fluorescence polarization as described previously (46Xu H.Q.

The assays were performed using a Bio-Logic autotitrator (TCU-250) and a Bio-Logic optical system (MOS450/AF-CD) in fluorescence anisotropy mode. Varying amounts of proteins were added to 1 ml of binding buffer containing 5 nm DNA substrate. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate in solution for 1.5 min, after which fluorescence polarization was measured. Titrations were performed in a temperature-controlled cuvette at 25 °C. The solution was stirred continuously by a small magnetic stir bar during the whole titration process. The stoichiometry (N) and dissociation constant (KD, in units of molarity) were determined by globally fitting the anisotropy data according to Equation 1 (49Kopelman M. Cogan U. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 439: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 50Xu H. Wang Y. Bleuit J.S. Morrical S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7651-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), αDT=NPTα1-α-KD(Eq. 1) where DT represents the total concentration of DNA and PT is the concentration of RecQ protein in the binding solution, and Equation 2, α=Amax-AAmax-Amin(Eq. 2) where A is the fluorescence anisotropy at a given concentration of RecQ, Amax is the anisotropy at saturation, and Amin is the initial anisotropy. For convenience of fitting, Equation 1 can be further written as follows, A=Amin+(Amax-Amin)Δ-Δ2-4cVDTNPT2DT(Eq. 3) where Δ= cV DT + NPT + KD, and cV is used to account for the decrease of DNA concentration during the titration. In terms of the RecQ concentration in the binding solution (PT) and that in the titrant (Ptitrant), cV can be expressed as cV = 1 - PT/Ptitrant. Stopped-flow Fluorescence Measurements—The stopped-flow assays were carried out using a Bio-Logic SFM-400 mixer with a 1.5 mm × 1.5-mm cell (FC-15, Bio-Logic) and the Bio-Logic MOS450/AF-CD optical system equipped with a 150-watt mercury-xenon lamp. Fluorescein was excited at 492 nm (2-nm slit width), and its emission was monitored at 525 nm using a high pass filter with 20-nm bandwidth (D525/20; Chroma Technology Co.). Unwinding kinetics were measured in a two-syringe mode, where RecQ helicase and duplex DNA substrates were preincubated at 25 °C in syringe 1 for 5 min while ATP and protein trap were in syringe 4. Each syringe contained unwinding reaction buffer, and the unwinding reaction was initiated by rapid mixing. All concentrations listed are after mixing unless noted otherwise. For converting the output data from volts to percentage unwinding, a calibration experiment was performed in a four-syringe mode, where helicase in syringe 1, hexachlorofluorescein-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides in syringe 2, and fluorescein-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides in syringe 3 were incubated in unwinding reaction buffer, and the solution in syringe 4 was the same as in the above unwinding experiment. The fluorescent signal of the mixed solution from the four syringes corresponded to 100% unwinding. All of the solutions were filtered and extensively degassed immediately before they were used. The stopped-flow temperature was controlled by means of an external thermostated water bath (B12; Thermo Haake) and a high flux pump to circulate the water between the bath and the stopped-flow apparatus. The standard reaction temperature was 25 °C. Kinetic Data Analysis—As indicated under “Results,” all stopped-flow kinetic traces were an average of over 15 individual traces. The kinetic traces were analyzed using Bio-Kine (version 4.26; Bio-Logic) with one of the following equations. A(t)=A(1-e-kobst)(Eq. 4) A(t)=A1(1-e-kobs,1t)+A2(1-e-kobs,2t)(Eq. 5) A(t)=A1(1-e-kobs,1t)+ksteadyt(Eq. 6) A(t)=A11-∑n=1kobsn-1tn-1(n-1)!e-kobst+ksteadyt(Eq. 7) In Equation 4, A(t) represents the unwinding amplitude as a function of time, A is the total unwinding amplitude, and kobs is the unwinding rate constant. In Equation 5, A1 (A2) and kobs,1 (kobs,2) represent, respectively, the unwinding amplitude and rate of the fast (slow) phase. In Equation 6, A1 and kobs,1 represent, respectively, the unwinding amplitude and rate of the fast phase, and ksteady represents the steady-state rate. It should be noted that Equation 6 corresponds to Equation 5 (i.e. ksteady = A2kobs,2) in the special case of kobs,2t << 1. Equation 7 is used to determine the step size of DNA unwinding (51Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 52Ali J.A. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 815-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), where A1 is the unwinding amplitude of the fast phase, n is the number of steps required to unwind the duplex DNA, and kobs is equivalent to the unwinding rate in one step when neglecting the dissociation rate of the enzyme during unwinding. RecQ Preferentially Binds 3′-Flanking Duplex DNA in Proportion to ssDNA Tail Length—It has been shown that RecQ helicase unwinds dsDNA in the 3′-5′ direction and binds both ssDNA and dsDNA with a preference for ssDNA (46Xu H.Q. Zhang A.H. Auclair C. Xi X.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 48Dou S.-X. Wang P.-Y. Xu H.Q. Xi X.G. J. Biol.

A. 1990; 87: 5363-5364Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, the binding affinity of RecQ for a partial dsDNA that contains a 3′- or 5′-tail, compared with ssDNA and dsDNA, is not known, and neither is the binding preference for 3′- or 5′-overhanged dsDNA. To address these questions, the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of the RecQ helicase for three different DNA substrates were determined using a fluorescence polarization assay, as described previously (46Xu H.Q. Zhang A.H. Auclair C. Xi X.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 48Dou S.-X. Wang P.-Y. Xu H.Q. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6354-6363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The blunt-ended and 3′- or 5′-overhanged dsDNA were used. The titration experiments were performed under conditions essentially identical to those used for the DNA unwinding, but without ATP, by titrating 5 nm of dsDNA (initial concentration) with increasing concentrations of RecQ. The anisotropy of the fluorescein-labeled DNA was then measured. The fluorometric data were fitted to Equation 3 to determine the stoichiometric number (N) and the dissociation constant. The typical titration curves are given in Fig. 1A. RecQ did not bind the blunt-ended dsDNA until the concentration reached 150 nm. However, RecQ did bind the 3′-overhanged dsDNA with a 5-50-nt tail. RecQ could also bind 5′-overhanged dsDNA but with a much lower affinity (see Fig. 1C). The stoichiometric numbers and dissociation constant were then determined using Equation 3. For the 3′-overhanged dsDNA, the number of the RecQ molecules bound per DNA substrate increased linearly with increasing tail length, with a slope of 0.114 ± 0.003 RecQ molecule/nt (Fig. 1B), which corresponds to a binding size of 8.8 ± 0.2 nt. This number is similar to that determined previously (∼10 nt) (48Dou S.-X. Wang P.-Y. Xu H.Q. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6354-6363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant per site, KD/N, for both 3′- and 5′-overhanged dsDNA was given in Fig. 1C. The lowest KD/N values were observed for the 3′-overhanged dsDNA with a 3′-ssDNA tail of 10 and 15 nt, indicating that the RecQ protein had a much higher affinity for binding to the ss/dsDNA junction than to ssDNA. This explains why RecQ could still bind very well to the ss/dsDNA substrate with only a 5-nt tail, whereas it had very low affinity even for a 7-nt ssDNA substrate (48Dou S.-X. Wang P.-Y. Xu H.Q. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6354-6363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similar phenomena have been recently observed for NS3h (54Levin M.K. Gurjar M. Patel S.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The noncooperative binding model (Equation 3) fitted well to the binding curves, indicating that RecQ binds DNA with no cooperativity. This is in agreement with the previous observation (48Dou S.-X. Wang P.-Y. Xu H.Q. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6354-6363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the RecQ helicase preferentially binds the 3′-overhanged dsDNA. Pre-steady-state Kinetic Analysis of DNA Unwinding Catalyzed by RecQ Reveals That the Enzyme Functions as a Monomer—Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis has been shown to be a powerful method of determining the quantity of active enzyme in the reaction mixture by measuring the first cycle of product formation. Knowledge of the stoichiometry between the formed product and the active enzyme involved in the catalysis can offer an insight into the mechanism by which the enzyme functions (55Liao J.-C. Jeong Y.-J. Kim D.-E. Patel S.S. Oster G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 452-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently, in combination with rapid kinetic techniques, pre-steady-state kinetic analysis has been successfully applied to investigate the kinetic process of helicase-catalyzed dsDNA unwinding, especially for determining the active form of helicases, such as Rep (17Cheng W. Hsieh J. Brendza K.M. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 327-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and Dda (28Nanduri B. Byrd A.K. Eoff R.L. Tackett A.J. Raney K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

GLP-1 induces glucose-dependent insulin secretion in the pancreas, whereas glucagon stimulates gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver. The identification of a hybrid peptide acting as both a GLP-1 agonist and a glucagon antagonist would provide a novel approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Toward this end a series of hybrid peptides made up of glucagon and either GLP-1 or exendin-4, a GLP-1 agonist, was engineered.

To overcome the short half-life of this mutant peptide in vivo, while retaining dual GLP-1 agonist and glucagon antagonist activities, site-specific attachment of long chained polyethylene glycol (PEGylation) was pursued.

GLP-1 and glucagon originate from a common precursor, pre-proglucagon, which upon tissue-specific processing leads to production of GLP-1 in the intestine and glucagon in the pancreas (for review see Ref. 1Mayo K.E. Miller L.J. Bataille D. Dalle S. Goke B. Thorens B. Drucker D.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 167-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). GLP-1 and glucagon constitute highly homologous peptides, displaying identity at 14 positions (45% identity) and similarity at 3 positions. The receptors for these two peptides are homologous (58% identity) and belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors (2Jelinek L.J. Lok S. Rosenberg G.B. Smith R.A. Grant F.J. Biggs S.

A. 1992; 89: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). However, despite the high degree of homology between the peptides and the homology between their receptors, GLP-1 and glucagon bind with a high degree of selectivity to their respective receptors (4Hjorth S.A. Adelhorst K. Pedersen B.B. Kirk O. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30121-30124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exendin-4 is a structural homolog of GLP-1 (50% amino acid identity) isolated from saliva of the Gila monster that also acts as a potent agonist of the GLP-1 receptor (5Goke R. Fehmann H.C. Linn T. Schmidt H. Krause M. Eng J. Goke B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Both GLP-1 and glucagon play major, but opposing, roles in overall glucose homeostasis. GLP-1 is synthesized in intestinal endocrine cells and induces glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the pancreas and thereby acts to lower plasma glucose concentrations without the risk of hypoglycemia (6Mojsov S. Kopczynski M.G. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8001-8008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Weir G.C. Mojsov S. Hendrick G.K. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 338-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activity of GLP-1 has made it attractive as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (for review see Ref. 8Roges O.A. Baron M. Philis-Tsimikas A. Expert. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2005; 14: 705-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Glucagon is secreted fromα-cells in pancreatic islets in a glucose-dependent manner. Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, resulting in elevation of plasma glucose. Glucagon has a critical role in maintaining serum glucose concentration, and glucagon receptor antagonists are being pursued as a potential therapeutic approach to inhibit hepatic glucose output (for review see Ref. 9Jiang G. Zhang B.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E671-E678Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). A molecule capable of both activation of the GLP-1 receptor and inhibition of the glucagon receptor has potential to be a highly effective and novel approach to control blood glucose in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.Structure-activity studies have been performed to determine the role of individual amino acids within both GLP-1 and glucagon sequences. GLP-1 and glucagon have no defined structure in aqueous solution, but in the presence of micelles, adopt an α-helical structure in the midsection, with flexible N- and C-terminal regions (10Thornton K. Gorenstein D.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3532-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Ying J. Ahn J.M. Jacobsen N.E. Brown M.F. Hruby V.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2825-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This suggests that the helical structure is required for binding to their respective receptors. Mutations in the N-terminal region of both peptides result in receptor antagonists, suggesting the importance of the N terminus for receptor activation by both GLP-1 (12Knudsen L.B. Pridal L. Eur. J.

Bittar E.E. Bittar N. Principles of Medical Biology. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1997: 387-401Google Scholar). For example, mutations at positions 11, 12, 16, 17, and 18 of glucagon appear to negatively affect receptor activation more than binding (20Unson C.G. Wu C.R. Cheung C.P. Merrifield R.B. J. Biol.

Some possible increase in glucagon antagonism may also be provided by changes in amino acids 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 21, and 29 (24Smith R.A. Sisk R. Lockhart P. Mathewes S. Gilbert T. Walker K. Piggot J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 741-748PubMed Google Scholar).For GLP-1, extensive mutational analysis has been reported. For example, alanine-scanning mutagenesis on GLP-1-(7-36)-amide implicates positions 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 22, 23, and 26 to be critical for receptor binding (25Adelhorst K. Hedegaard B.B. Knudsen L.B. Kirk O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6275-6278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gallwitz B. Witt M. Paetzold G. Morys-Wortmann C. Zimmermann B. Eckart K. Folsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). On the other hand, combinatorial alanine substitutions at positions 8, 11, 12, and 16 of GLP-1 have a minimal effect on GLP-1 receptor binding and activation (27Xiao Q. Giguere J. Parisien M. Jeng W. St-Pierre S.A. Brubaker P.L. Wheeler M.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2860-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In vivo, GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP-IV), a protease responsible for cleaving peptides containing proline or alanine residues in the penultimate N-terminal position, resulting in the inactive GLP-1-(9-36)-amide metabolite (28Mentlein R. Gallwitz B. Schmidt W.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Removal of the DPP-IV site by mutagenesis greatly improves plasma stability (29Ritzel U. Leonhardt U. Ottleben M. Ruhmann A. Eckart K. Spiess J. Ramadori G. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 159: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Exendin-4 has a prolonged half-life in vivo relative to GLP-1 likely due to the lack of the DPP-IV site (5Goke R. Fehmann H.C. Linn T. Schmidt H. Krause M. Eng J. Goke B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The similarity between GLP-1 and glucagon, and between their respective receptors, raises the possibility of producing a hybrid peptide that can bind to both receptors. Indeed, Hjorth et al. (4Hjorth S.A. Adelhorst K. Pedersen B.B. Kirk O. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30121-30124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) generated a chimeric peptide consisting of the N-terminal part of the glucagon molecule joined to the C-terminal part of the GLP-1 molecule that displayed high affinity for both receptors. However, the design of a peptide that binds both receptors and exhibits agonist activity on the GLP-1 receptor but antagonist activity on the glucagon receptor is more challenging.A therapeutic drug based upon a hybrid peptide with dual GLP-1 agonist and glucagon antagonist action would still have to overcome the very short half-life (<5 min) inherent to its parent peptides, which makes them unsuitable for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. PEGylation, the covalent attachment of long chained polyethylene glycol (PEG) to a target molecule, has been successfully employed to increase the circulation half-life of proteins, allowing once-a-week dosing (for review see Ref. 30Harris J.M. Chess R.B. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2003; 2: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2681) Google Scholar). PEGylation protects the protein from protease digestion and keeps the protein out of the kidney filtrate. However, the high molecular weight PEGs required for significant improvement of plasma half-life tend to have a negative effect on protein activity, due to steric hindrance. Given the small size of GLP-1 and glucagon peptides, and the fact that functionally important amino acids are spread throughout the peptide sequences, it is a further challenge to generate a PEGylated peptide that retains dual GLP-1 agonist and glucagon antagonist activities.In the current study, we have engineered hybrid glucagon/GLP-1 peptides with targeted mutations that result in the identification of a peptide with both GLP-1 agonist and glucagon antagonist activity. We believe this is the first example of a single chimeric peptide that possesses opposing agonist and antagonist effects on related receptors. To enhance the duration of action, we have site-specifically modified the hybrid peptides with high molecular weight PEGs and succeeded in identifying a PEGylated peptide retaining both GLP-1 agonist and glucagon antagonist activities.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis and PEGylation—Peptides were supplied by Sigma Genosys (The Woodlands, TX) or SynPep (Dublin, CA).

Peptides were site-specifically PEGylated with 22- or 43-kDa PEG-maleimide purchased from Nektar Therapeutics (San Carlos, CA) and purified to >95% purity (data not shown).RINm5F Cell Culture—RINm5F cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.Preparation of RINm5F Cell Membranes—RINm5F cells were washed with PBS, scraped in ice-cold HES buffer (20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose buffer containing protease inhibitors), and homogenized. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min. Membranes were resuspended in HES.Preparation of Plasma Membranes from Rat Liver—Male Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed, and livers were removed and placed into ice-cold TES buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose containing protease inhibitors). The tissue was minced in 5 volumes of ice-cold TES, and a slurry was prepared using a Polytron. The slurry was further homogenized using a handheld Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was passed through several layers of cheesecloth and spun at 25,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in TES, and plasma membranes were isolated from the interface of 1.2 m sucrose and TES cushion centrifugation at 180,000 × g. The resulting membranes were washed with TES using a 15-min centrifugation at 200,000 × g, resuspended in TES again, and purified on a second sucrose cushion at 200,000 × g. The final pellet was resuspended in TES.Competitive Binding of Peptide to the GLP-1 and Glucagon Receptors—GF/C filtration plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were blocked with 0.3% or 0.1% polyethyleneimine for RINm5F membranes and rat liver plasma membranes, respectively. Filter plates were washed twice with binding buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mg/ml bacitracin. 5 μg of RINm5F cell plasma membranes or 3-5 μg of rat liver plasma membranes diluted in binding buffer were combined with 0.05 μCi of 125I-labeled GLP-1 or 125I-labeled glucagon and unlabeled test peptide at the indicated concentrations. Following a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the plates were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The plates were dried, scintillant was added to each well, and plates were counted using a Wallac Microbeta counter.Measurement of Peptide Signaling through GLP-1 Receptor—1.5 × 105 RINm5F cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates and grown overnight. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and then incubated with peptide in Hepes-PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were lysed, and intracellular cAMP was determined using the cAMP Scintillation Proximity Assay direct screening assay system (Amersham Biosciences).Measurement of Peptide Signaling through Glucagon Receptor—Hepatocytes were isolated according to a modified procedure of Berry (31Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were plated in 96-well plates at 7.5 × 104 cells/well in Hepes-bicarbonate-PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine. Following equilibration at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% O2 environment for 10 min, peptide was added for an additional 15 min. The cells were lysed, and intracellular cAMP was determined as described above. The ability of the hybrid peptide to inhibit glucagon activity was measured as follows: Following equilibration at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95%O2 environment for 10 min, 10 μm peptide was added to the cells followed immediately by either 2 or 10 nm glucagon for 15 min. The cells were lysed, and cAMP was determined.Measurement of Glucose Release from Rat Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were added into a flat bottom 96-well plate (2 × 105/100 μl/well) and preincubated in a 37 °C incubator with constant shaking and under 95% O2/5% CO2 flow for 10 min. Hepatocytes were incubated for another 30 min after addition of glucagon with or without peptide. Cells were then lysed with 15% perchloric acid and plates were spun. The supernatant was neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0):2.5 n KOH (45:55) and spun again. The resulting supernatant was analyzed for glucose with hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the A340 read on a fMAX plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Glucose output was calculated in the following manner: after subtracting the amount of glucose produced in the unstimulated hepatocytes from each data point, the percent inhibition was calculated.Insulin Release from Perifused Rat Islets—The bi-phasic response of insulin release stimulated by peptides was tested in perifused rat islets. Fifty islets were loaded in a perifusion chamber and perifused with HEPES-Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 3 mm glucose at 37 °C. After 60 min, islets were exposed to buffer containing 8 mm glucose with or without peptide (50 nm) and perifused for another 30 min. Fractions of perifusate were collected at 1- or 5-min intervals for insulin determination. Insulin was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Alpco Diagnostics, Windham, NH).Measurement of Peptide Stability in Rat Plasma—Fresh rat plasma was collected from male Wistar rats. The peptides were diluted in 100% rat plasma to 10-fold desired final concentration and incubated at 37 °C for 0, 3, 6, 18, or 24 h. Samples were then added to RINm5F cells, and cAMP production was measured after a 15-min exposure as outlined above. Percent peptide remaining was determined by comparing cAMP production at a given time point to cAMP production in a freshly diluted sample (zero time).Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test—Male Wistar rats (220-250 g) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). All procedures were approved by the Bayer Animal Care and Use Committee, and all experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Male Wistar rats were either fasted overnight and then given peptide or vehicle by subcutaneous injection or they were given peptide or vehicle first and then fasted overnight, depending on the time interval between dosing and when the IPGTT was to be performed. At the appropriate time after dosing, the fasting blood glucose level was measured from tail-tip blood using a Glucometer (Bayer HealthCare, Mishawaka, IN), and the animals were given 2 g/kg glucose by intraperitoneal injection. Blood glucose was measured again after 15, 30, and 60 min. The area under the glucose curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoidal method, and the effect of the peptide on the AUC was expressed as a percentage of the AUC for the vehicle-treated group.Statistical Analysis—In vitro results are means ± S.E. for the number of experiments (n) indicated in the figure legends. In vitro assay statistics were calculated by t test using Graphpad Prizm (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). In vivo data are expressed ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using InStat (GraphPad). Treatment effects were analyzed by analysis of variance with post hoc analysis using Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparisons Test (parametric methods) or the Kruskal-Wallis Test (non-parametric methods) when necessary. Differences are considered significant at p values of <0.05.RESULTSTo engineer a long acting dual GLP-1 agonist and glucagon antagonist peptide, a three-stage mutagenesis strategy was employed. In the first stage, glucagon, GLP-1, and the related GLP-1 agonist, exendin-4, were combined to generate a series of chimeric peptides with the goal of identifying peptides with high affinity toward GLP-1 and glucagon receptors. In stage two, mutations known to antagonize the glucagon receptor but not known to antagonize the GLP-1 receptor were selectively introduced into the GLP-1/glucagon binding-optimized chimeric peptide identified in stage one, leading to the identification of a peptide with potential to act as both a GLP-1 agonist and glucagon antagonist. The GLP-1 agonist and glucagon antagonist activities of the stage two selected peptide was then tested in secondary cell assays to examine its ability to promote pancreatic islet insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon-induced hepatocyte glucose output. Finally, in stage three, cysteine and lysine mutagenesis procedures were performed to identify a position suitable for attachment of a high molecular weight PEG to prolong duration of action in vivo.Stage 1: Optimization of Dual Binding Affinities to GLP-1 and Glucagon Receptors—As previously reported, both glucagon and GLP-1 displayed high affinity (IC50) and potency (EC50) for their own receptors but no significant cross-reactivity for the other receptor (Table 2). To identify novel peptides capable of binding to both receptors, 15 peptides (A1-A15) were synthesized (Table 1). Peptides A1 to A6 were designed to progressively introduce GLP-1-specific amino acids into the glucagon sequence from the C terminus. The N-terminal 18 amino acids of glucagon are critical for high affinity binding to its receptor, because C-terminal replacements with GLP-1 sequence beyond this point greatly reduce glucagon binding affinity (Table 2). The IC50 of A4-A6 at the glucagon receptor were at least 10-fold higher than that of peptides A1-A3. Exchange of only the three C-terminal amino acids of glucagon with the corresponding C-terminal GLP-1 amino acids, while only causing <3-fold decrease in glucagon receptor affinity, reduced glucagon agonist activity by >100-fold, as exhibited by peptide A1. Therefore, the precise amino acid sequence of the C-terminal portion of glucagon appears to be required for activation but not binding to the glucagon receptor. In contrast, binding to the GLP-1 receptor is much more tolerant to insertion of glucagon amino acids into the GLP-1 sequence. Even peptide A1, with 12 amino acid differences from GLP-1 in the N-terminal 26 positions, displayed relatively high affinity (IC50 = 6 nm) and potency (EC50 = 21.7 nm) for the GLP-1 receptor. Successive introduction of more GLP-1 amino acids into glucagon further enhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor culminating in peptide A6, which has four amino acid differences from GLP-1 but almost an identical IC50 and EC50 as GLP-1. Peptide A3, a chimera sequence of glucagon-(1-19) and GLP-1-(20-30) possesses the most desired in vitro profile of a potent GLP-1 agonist (EC50 = 4.9 nm) and a strong glucagon receptor binder (IC50 = 7.7 nm). Moreover, peptide A3 is a weak glucagon agonist (EC50 = 361 nm) and could potentially act as a glucagon antagonist. However, consistent glucagon antagonism could not be demonstrated with peptide A3 (data not shown) perhaps because it can act as a full agonist of the glucagon receptor at sufficiently high concentrations.TABLE 2Hybrid peptide GLP-1/glucagon receptor binding and activity GLP-1 and glucagon receptor binding (IC50) and activation (EC50) to receptors on RINm5F cells or rat liver membranes, respectively.

The non-natural amino acid norleucine is denoted as X. C-terminal amide is symbolized by asterisk. Open table in a new tab Similar substitution of glucagon with exendin-4 amino acids (A7-A11) showed comparable results at the GLP-1 receptor, suggesting GLP-1- or exendin-4-specific amino acids in the N-terminal portion are not required for potent activities at the GLP-1 receptor. Unlike the GLP-1 amino acids, substitution of exendin-4 amino acids into glucagon had a more profound effect on glucagon receptor binding. Only peptide A8 displayed high affinity and potency at the glucagon receptor. Introduction of a combination of GLP-1 and exendin-4 amino acids into peptides (A12-A15) showed a similar trend and again did not produce any peptide with a better profile with respect to GLP-1 agonist activity and lack of glucagon agonist activity when compared with peptide A3. Thus, peptide A3 was selected as the lead peptide from this stage and the template sequence for the next stage of mutagenesis.Stage 2: Optimization of GLP-1 Agonism and Glucagon Antagonism—To generate a peptide mutant that retains GLP-1 agonism but blocks glucagon from activating its receptor (i.e. glucagon antagonism) 18 peptides were designed that introduced known glucagon antagonist mutations into the template peptide A3 (Table 1). Mutations at positions 11, 12, and 16, which have been shown to affect glucagon receptor activation much more than glucagon receptor binding (21Unson C.G. Wu C.R. Fitzpatrick K.J. Merrifield R.B. J.

https://openalex.org/W2042172278,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-α (PTPα) activates Src family kinases (SFKs) to promote the integrin-stimulated early autophosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We report here that integrin stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPα. PTPα was dephosphorylated upon fibroblast detachment from the substratum and rephosphorylated when cells were plated on the integrin ligand fibronectin. α PTP phosphorylation occurred at Tyr789 and required SFKs (Src or Fyn/Yes), FAK, and an intact cytoskeleton. It also required active PTPα or constitutively active Src. These observations indicate that PTPα activates SFKs and that the subsequently activated SFK·FAK tyrosine kinase complex in turn phosphorylates PTPα. Reintroduction of wild-type PTPα or unphosphorylatable PTPα(Y789F) (but not inactive PTPα) into PTPα-null fibroblasts restored defective integrin-induced SFK activation, FAK phosphorylation, and paxillin phosphorylation. PTPα(Y789F) and inactive PTPα could not rescue delayed actin stress fiber assembly and focal adhesion formation or defective cell migration. This study distinguishes two roles of PTPα in integrin signaling: an early role as an activator of SFKs and FAK with no requirement for PTPα phosphorylation and a later downstream role in cytoskeleton-associated events for which PTPα phosphorylation at Tyr789 is essential.

Engagement of the receptor integrins by extracellular matrix ligands determines multiple cellular responses, notably those required for the complex process of cell movement. Many of these responses are mediated through early, tyrosine phosphorylation-based activation of the central signaling molecule focal adhesion kinase (FAK), 4The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; SFKs, Src family kinases; SH, Src homology; PTPα, protein-tyrosine phosphatase-α; FN, fibronectin. 4The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; SFKs, Src family kinases; SH, Src homology; PTPα, protein-tyrosine phosphatase-α; FN, fibronectin. and require the participation of Src family kinases (SFKs) (1Mitra S.K.

Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7928-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Integrin-stimulated phosphorylation of FAK and the ensuing formation of the SFK·FAK tyrosine kinase complex result in further phosphorylation and maximal activation of FAK, phosphorylation of FAK at sites that enable proteins such as Grb2 to associate with FAK, and phosphorylation of other substrates such as Cas and paxillin to promote further protein-protein associations and signaling events. Phospho-FAK ultimately serves as a scaffold and coordinating center that regulates focal adhesion formation and disassembly, actin stress fiber and cytoskeletal organization, and dynamic alterations in cell shape.The precise molecular events linking integrins to the initial and essential phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 are still not well defined. Phosphorylation of FAK at this site can be accomplished by autophosphorylation (3Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), but maximal Tyr397 phosphorylation requires SFKs that participate in an autocatalytic loop by phosphorylating FAK at Tyr576 and Tyr577 to enhance FAK activity and thus promote full autophosphorylation (4Calalb M.B.

The essential role of SFKs in FAK activation is demonstrated by the attenuated FAK autophosphorylation in response to integrin engagement in triple knockout fibroblasts lacking the SFKs Src, Fyn, and Yes (7Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) or in cells treated with the SFK inhibitor PP2 (8Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17788-17795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).SFK activity is constrained by intramolecular interactions involving binding of the SFK SH2 domain to the C-terminal phosphotyrosyl residue (in Src, Tyr527) and binding of the SFK SH3 domain to a region between the SH3 and kinase domains (9Williams J.C.

In this state, the regulatory tyrosine residue in the activation loop (in Src, Tyr416) is hypophosphorylated. Events that disrupt these interactions lead to conformational changes and the ensuing dephosphorylation of Tyr527, autophosphorylation of Tyr416, and kinase activation. Several mechanisms of integrin-dependent SFK activation have been described, in accord with the physical and functional requirement for SFKs in efficient FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation. FAK itself has been proposed to participate in Src activation, where early low level FAK Tyr397 autophosphorylation enables Src SH2 domain binding and the consequent disruption of Src intramolecular inhibitory constraints to promote Src activity (3Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). A direct linkage between β3 integrins and Src (mediated through the Src SH3 domain) may likewise destabilize Src intramolecular inhibitory interactions to permit Src autophosphorylation and activation upon integrin clustering (12Obergfell A.

Other SFKs associate with other integrin β-subunits, raising the possibility that activation of these kinases may occur in specific yet similar fashions. Another sequence of events involves the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase-α (PTPα), a physiological activator of SFKs (14Ponniah S. Wang D.Z.M. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr.

Thus, FAK- or integrin-mediated SFK activation and PTPα-catalyzed SFK activation may be interconnected rather than exclusive mechanisms of SFK activation in integrin signaling.How integrin engagement functionally alters PTPα to enable or to regulate subsequent signaling events is unknown. We report here that fibronectin-induced integrin stimulation results in the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPα at Tyr789. Our investigation of the role of this in integrin signaling demonstrates that it is not required for PTPα-mediated activation of SFKs or for efficient FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation. However, it is necessary for actin stress fiber assembly and focal adhesion formation involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and for cell migration. These findings identify and distinguish two roles for PTPα in integrin signaling: an early upstream role in promoting FAK autophosphorylation and SFK activation that is independent of PTPα tyrosine phosphorylation and a second role in focal adhesion formation and cytoskeletal alterations requiring PTPα tyrosine phosphorylation that is likely mediated by the active SFK·FAK complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Cell Culture—PTPα+/+(wild type), PTPα-/-, and Src-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived from the appropriate mouse embryos and spontaneously immortalized. These cell lines were used at passages 30-40 for the experiments described here. SYF (Src-/-/Fyn-/-/Yes-/-), Src+/+ (Src+/+/Fyn-/-/Yes-/-), FAK+/+, and FAK-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines were obtained from American Type Tissue Collection. The cells were all grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Prior to stimulation by fibronectin (FN), cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 18 h. In one experiment, cells were pretreated with 3 μm cytochalasin D (Sigma) for 20 min before trypsinization. The same amount of cytochalasin D was added during suspension and plating of cells on FN-coated dishes in serum-free medium.Expression Plasmids—The mammalian expression vectors pXJ41-PTPα-neo and pXJ41-PTPα(C433S/C723S)-neo have been described previously (18Zheng X.-M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 20Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The pXJ41-PTPα(Y789F)-neo plasmid was created by site-directed mutation of the appropriate PTPα-encoding nucleotides in the plasmid pGEX-KG-PTPα (21Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the PTPα mutant was excised and cloned into pXJ41-neo. Chicken c-src cDNA with a Y527F mutation was excised from the pLNCX vector (a gift from J. S. Brugge) and cloned into pXJ41-neo. The PTPα-/- cells were transfected with these plasmids using Lipofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen).Antibodies and Immunological Detection Reagents—Rabbit anti-PTPα antiserum 2205 has been described previously (22Lim K.L. Kolatkar P.R. Ng K.P. Ng C.H. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28986-28993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY20), FAK, paxillin, and Fyn used for immunoblotting were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to FAK Tyr397 and Tyr576 and Src and Tyr418 Tyr529 were from BIOSOURCE. Anti-dephospho-Src antibody (SRC 2) and anti-Fyn antibody used for immunoprecipitation were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-v-Src antibody (Ab-1) was from Oncogene Research Products. Anti-vinculin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (F-actin staining) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were from Molecular Probes.Anti-PTPα Phospho-Tyr789 Antibody—Anti-PTPα phospho-Tyr789 antibody was custom-made by 21st Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA). Rabbits were immunized with the phosphotyrosyl peptide CYIDAFSDpY789 ANFK (sequence confirmed by MS Check™) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. To ensure specificity, the sera obtained from immunized animals were subjected to multiple rounds of immunodepletion by passage through an affinity column of immobilized non-phosphopeptide antigen. This was followed by affinity purification using a column with the phosphopeptide antigen as ligand.Plating on Extracellular Matrix—FN (10 μg/ml; Chemicon International, Inc.) and poly-l-lysine (20 μg/ml; Sigma) were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. Diluted FN and poly-l-lysine were added to tissue culture dishes and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Before use, the dishes were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were serum-starved overnight and detached with 0.05% trypsin and 0.35 mm EDTA (Invitrogen). The trypsin action was stopped with 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and the cells were then washed twice with serum-free medium. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and maintained at 37 °C for 1 h. Suspended cells were plated onto extracellular matrixcoated plates (105 cells/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for various times.Cell Migration Assay—Haptotactic migration assays with FN were carried out as described previously (16Zeng L. Si X. Yu W.-P. Le H.T. Ng K.P. Teng R.M.H. Ryan K. Wang D.Z.M. Ponniah S. Pallen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cells (PTPα+/+, PTPα-/-, and PTPα-/- infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing different forms of PTPα) were serum-starved overnight prior to use in these assays, and cells (1 × 106/ml) were resuspended in 0.1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% BSA and added to each upper chamber. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed, fixed, stained, and counted.Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and processed for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments as described (16Zeng L. Si X. Yu W.-P. Le H.T. Ng K.P. Teng R.M.H. Ryan K. Wang D.Z.M. Ponniah S. Pallen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.02% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, the cells were incubated with anti-vinculin antibody (1:250 dilution) for 2 h. This was followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (1:250 dilution) for F-actin staining. Coverslips were mounted in VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and viewed using an Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Images were captured by a MicroColor CCD digital camera (CRi Inc.) and processed using SmartCapture VP software (Digital Scientific, Ltd.).PTPα Adenoviral Expression System—The AdEasy vector system (Qbiogene, Inc.) was used for PTPα expression in mouse fibroblasts. PTPα and PTPα(C433S/C723S) cDNAs with PacI site mutations have been described (16Zeng L. Si X. Yu W.-P. Le H.T. Ng K.P. Teng R.M.H. Ryan K. Wang D.Z.M. Ponniah S. Pallen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PTPα(Y789F) with a PacI site mutation was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutant forward primer sequence was 5′-GAT GCA TTC TCA GAT TTC GCC AAC TTC AAG TAA GCG-3′, and the mutant reverse primer sequence was 5′-CGC TTA CTT GAA GTT GGC GAA ATC TGA GAA TGC ATC-3′. The absence of other mutations introduced by PCR was confirmed by sequencing. The cDNAs encoding wild-type PTPα, PTPα(C433S/C723S), and PTPα(Y789F) were cloned into the SalI and NotI sites of the pShuttle-CMV vector. The three resulting plasmids were linearized with PmeI and cotransformed with pAdEasy-1 into Escherichia coli strain BJ5183 to generate the infectious viral DNA plasmid containing the desired forms of PTPα by homologous recombination. Recombinants were selected by kanamycin, and positive colonies were retransformed into E. coli strain DH5α to preserve the correct recombinants. These plasmids were cleaved by PacI, purified using a PCR purification kit (Stratagene), and transfected into QBI-293A cells using Lipofectamine™ reagent. Viral particles were harvested from the cells by freeze/thaw cycles and purified by continuous CsCl gradient centrifugation. Virus titers were determined by TCID50. To infect fibroblasts, ∼10,000 viral particles/cell were used in a minimal volume of medium that completely covered the cells. Following incubation at 37 °C for 90 min, the medium was topped up to the normal level, and the cells were cultured for 24 h prior to further manipulation.RESULTSIntegrin-stimulated Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PTPα—PTPα was tyrosine-phosphorylated in adherent fibroblast cell cultures (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 5). To determine whether PTPα phosphorylation status was regulated by cell adhesion and integrin signaling, fibroblasts were placed in suspension for 1 h and then plated on dishes coated with the integrin ligand FN. Detachment of cells from the substratum induced the partial dephosphorylation of PTPα (to 57 ± 4% of that of PTPα in fully adherent and spread cells) (Fig. 1, A, lanes 2 and 6; and B). Plating on FN induced phosphorylation of PTPα to 71 ± 4% of the level in growing adherent cells after 5 min on FN, further increasing to 93 ± 7% of the original level after 30 min on FN (Fig. 1, A, lanes 3 and 4; and B). In contrast, plating the suspended cells on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes for 30 min did not induce significant rephosphorylation of PTPα (68 ± 7%) (Fig. 1, A, lanes 5-7; and B). Under the above conditions, the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPα correlated with that of cellular proteins (Fig. 1A), with the major phosphoprotein that was detected in the lysates comigrating with FAK (data not shown).Catalytically Inactive PTPα or PTPα(Y789F) Is Not Phosphorylated upon Integrin Stimulation—Tyr789 in the C-terminal region of PTPα has been reported to be the major site of PTPα tyrosine phosphorylation (23den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether this is the site phosphorylated upon integrin stimulation. In addition, because PTPα can dephosphorylate and activate Src and Fyn (18Zheng X.-M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 19den Hertog J. Pals C.E. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 20Bhandari V. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8691-8698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we determined whether the catalytic activity of PTPα is required for its phosphorylation. PTPα-/- fibroblasts were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing wild-type PTPα, catalytically inactive PTPα lacking the two active-site cysteine residues of each catalytic domain (PTPα(C433S/C723S)), or PTPα with Tyr789 substituted with Phe (PTPα(Y789F)). In adherent growing cells, heterologously expressed wild-type PTPα was tyrosine-phosphorylated as observed in normal fibroblasts, whereas PTPα(Y789F) and catalytically inactive PTPα were not detectably phosphorylated (Fig. 2A). The lack of phosphorylation of catalytically inactive PTPα suggested that PTPα might be required to activate an SFK to induce subsequent PTPα phosphorylation. In accord with this, coexpression of inactive PTPα and constitutively active Src(Y527F) in PTPα-/- cells caused a pronounced tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPα(C433S/C723S) in adherent cells and in cells plated on FN (Fig. 2B). In contrast, coexpression of PTPα(Y789F) and active Src(Y527F) did not induce phosphorylation of PTPα(Y789F) in cells adhering to the dish or plated on FN (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the negligible phosphorylation of this mutant form of PTPα in the presence of active Src is due to the lack of a major site of integrin-stimulated SFK-mediated phosphorylation at Tyr789.FIGURE 2Catalytically active PTPα or Src is required for phosphorylation of PTPα at Tyr789. A, wild-type (+/+) or PTPα-null (-/-) fibroblasts that were left untransfected or were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing wild-type PTPα (wt), mutant PTPα(Y789F), or inactive PTPα(C433S/C723S) (dm) were grown on plastic dishes. IB, immunoblot. B, PTPα-null fibroblasts transiently expressing inactive PTPα(C433S/C723S) alone (α-dm) or with constitutively active Src(Y527F) (src-Y527F) were grown on plastic dishes (Ad), placed in suspension (0), and then replated on FN-coated dishes for 30 min (FN30). C, PTPα-null fibroblasts transiently expressing inactive PTPα(Y789F) (α-Y789F) or wild-type PTPα (α-wt) alone or with constitutively active Src(Y527F) (src-Y527F) were grown on plastic dishes, placed in suspension, and then replated on FN-coated dishes for 30 min. PTPα immunoprecipitates (IP) were prepared from the cell lysates in A-C and probed for phosphotyrosine (upper panel) or PTPα (lower panel). D, PTPα-null fibroblasts were left uninfected or were infected with adenovirus (AdV) expressing wild-type PTPα, PTPα(Y789F), or PTPα(C433S/C723S). Cell lysates were probed with antibodies to PTPα phospho-Tyr789 (P-Y789; upper panel) and PTPα (lower panel). E, wild-type and PTPα-null fibroblasts were left uninfected, or the PTPα-null fibroblasts were infected with adenovirus expressing wild-type PTPα or PTPα(Y789F). After 24 h, the cells were placed in suspension (0) and plated on FN for 15 min (FN15) before harvesting. Lysates were probed with antibodies to PTPα phospho-Tyr789 (upper panel) and PTPα (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that Tyr789 was indeed the PTPα residue phosphorylated upon integrin stimulation, we used an antibody raised against a phosphotyrosyl peptide comprising the C-terminal 12 amino acids of PTPα. Wild-type PTPα, PTPα(Y789F), and PTPα(C433S/C723S) were expressed in PTPα-null fibroblasts by adenovirus-mediated infection. Lysates prepared from adherent cells were probed with anti-PTPα phospho-Tyr789 antibody. Consistent with the results obtained by probing with antiphosphotyrosine antibody, only wild-type PTPα was recognized by anti-PTPα phospho-Tyr789 antibody (Fig. 2D). In other experiments, uninfected wild-type or PTPα-null fibroblasts or PTPα-null fibroblasts expressing wild-type PTPα or PTPα(Y789F) were placed in suspension and then plated on FN for 15 min. Probing cell lysates with anti-PTPα phospho-Tyr789 antibody detected signals corresponding to FN-stimulated increases in PTPα tyrosine phosphorylation in wild-type fibroblasts and in PTPα-null cells re-expressing wild-type PTPα (Fig. 2E). No signal was detected in lysates of uninfected PTPα-null cells or cells re-expressing PTPα(Y789F) (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that the antibody specifically recognizes PTPα phosphorylated at Tyr789 and that this residue is phosphorylated upon integrin stimulation.SFKs Are Required for Integrin-stimulated PTPα Phosphorylation—The possibility that PTPα phosphorylation is mediated by SFKs was further investigated. As observed in wild-type fibroblasts, PTPα was dephosphorylated when embryonic fibroblasts lacking Src were placed in suspension and was rephosphorylated when the cells were plated on FN (Fig. 3A, left panels), indicating that Src itself is not essential for integrin-regulated PTPα phosphorylation. However, in adherent embryonic fibroblasts lacking the three SFKs Src, Yes, and Fyn (SYF cells), PTPα phosphorylation was greatly reduced. Detachment from the substratum and replating on FN did not alter PTPα phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, middle panels). In cells with Src but lacking Fyn and Yes expression, PTPα was phosphorylated in adherent cells, dephosphorylated when the cells were placed in suspension, and rephosphorylated when the cells were plated on FN (Fig. 3A, right panels). Similar effects on PTPα tyrosine phosphorylation were observed when lysates prepared from suspended or FN-stimulated cells of these three lines were probed with anti-PTPα phosphoTyr789 antibody (Fig. 3B). The relative levels of expression of PTPα, Src, Fyn, and Yes in these fibroblasts are shown in Fig. 3C. The above results indicate that one or more SFKs, either Fyn/Yes or Src, are essential for integrin-stimulated phosphorylation of PTPα at Tyr789.FIGURE 3SFKs are required for FN-induced PTPα tyrosine phosphorylation. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in Src (Src-/-); deficient in Src, Yes, and Fyn (SYF); or deficient in Fyn and Yes (Src+/+) were grown on plastic dishes in the presence of serum (Ad) and then serum-starved overnight and placed in suspension (0) prior to replating on FN-coated dishes for 5 (FN5) or 30 (FN30) min. A, PTPα immunoprecipitates (IP) prepared from cell lysates were probed for phosphotyrosine (upper panels) or PTPα (lower panels). B, lysates prepared from cells in suspension or plated on FN for 30 min were probed with antibodies to PTPα phospho-Tyr789 (P-Y789; upper panels) and PTPα (lower panels). C, expression of PTPα, Src, Fyn, Yes, and actin in wild-type (WT), PTPα-/-, Src+/+, Src-/-, and SYF fibroblasts was determined by immunoblotting (IB) of cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PTPα Phosphorylation Requires an Intact Actin Cytoskeleton and FAK—In addition to SFKs, we tested other requirements for integrinstimulated PTPα phosphorylation. Integrin activation induces actin polymerization, and the effects of disrupting the actin cytoskeleton by treatment with cytochalasin D were examined. PTPα is phosphorylated in adherent cells, and this was not affected by cytochalasin D (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). The dephosphorylation of PTPα induced by cell detachment was also unaltered by cytochalasin D (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). However, FN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPα was blocked in the presence of cytochalasin D (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6), as we observed with phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 (lanes 5 and 6) and as has been reported for FAK (25Lipfert L. Haimovitch B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). This indicates that an intact actin cytoskeleton is required for integrin-mediated PTPα phosphorylation. Because multiple integrin-stimulated phosphorylation events are mediated by the SFK·FAK complex, we also tested whether FAK is required for PTPα phosphorylation. Adherent FAK-null fibroblasts contained a greatly reduced level of phosp"

Angiopoietin-like proteins 3 and 4 have recently been characterized as potent lipoprotein lipase inhibitors and therefore as important components of plasma triglyceride homeostasis. In the present study, the role of thyroid hormone in the regulation of both ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL3 gene expression was investigated. In vivo studies revealed that thyroid hormone down-regulates ANGPTL3 but not ANGPTL4 gene expression in hypothyroid rats. Using thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-deficient mice, we show that thyroid hormone regulates ANGPTL3 gene expression in a TRβ-dependent manner. Transfection studies revealed that this inhibition occurs at the transcriptional level in a DNA binding-independent fashion and requires the proximal (–171 to +66) region of the ANGPTL3 gene promoter. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that the HNF1 site within this proximal region mediates this TRβ-dependent repression. Finally, co-transfection studies and electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that TRβ antagonizes the HNF1α signaling pathway by inhibiting its transcriptional activity without interfering with its DNA-binding capacity. Taken together, our results lead to the identification of ANGPTL3 as a novel TRβ target gene and provide a new potential mechanism to explain the hypotriglyceridemic properties of TRβ agonists in vivo.

Most of the effects of the thyroid hormone are mediated by the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), which are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6043) Google Scholar). Two distinct genes, THRA and THRB (encoding TRα and TRβ, respectively) produce various forms of TR proteins, including the functional receptors TRα1, TRβ1, and TRβ2 (2Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Whereas TR isoforms are detectable in almost every tissue, there is some isoform-specific pattern of distribution. TRα1 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and brown fat, and TRα2 expression is mostly restricted to the brain. The almost ubiquitous TRβ1 is mainly expressed in the brain, liver, and kidney, whereas TRβ2 is exclusively present in the pituitary and hypothalamus in adults. All of the TR isoforms except TRα2 bind T3 with a similar affinity (2Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). TRs regulate gene transcription through their binding to specific TR-response elements (TRE) located in the promoter regions of target genes. TRs can bind in the absence of T3 as homodimers but preferentially bind those TRE as heterodimers with another nuclear receptor, namely the retinoid X receptor. TR can positively or negatively regulate T3-responsive gene expression, depending on the nature of the TRE, the hormonal status, and the cellular environment (2Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). In the absence of T3, the TR/retinoid X receptor heterodimer is associated with corepressors at the TRE. Those corepressors interact with multi-subunit protein complexes containing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity that maintain the chromatin in a compact state repressing gene activation. Upon T3 binding, TR undergoes a conformational change, releasing corepressors and allowing coactivator binding, thereby promoting gene activation through histone acetylation. The transcription of any given gene is defined by the control of the interactions between TR and those co-regulatory proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 3Moore J.M. Guy R.K. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 475-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar and 4Wu Y. Koenig R.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 207-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The use of transgenic and knock-out mouse models revealed the existence of TR isoform-specific functions (see Ref. 5Flamant F. Samarut J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 85-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar for review). Whereas it has been shown that TRα plays a key role in cardiac function by regulating both heart rate and contractility, TRβ has been characterized as a master regulator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid feedback and an important regulator of cholesterol homeostasis (5Flamant F. Samarut J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 85-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In fact, the link between thyroid disease and lipid disorders has been established several decades ago (6Duntas L.H. Thyroid. 2002; 12: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Hypothyroidism is characterized by elevated low density lipoprotein levels as well as an increased risk of atherosclerosis (7Hansson P. Valdemarsson S. Nilsson-Ehle P. Horm. Metab. Res. 1983; 15: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Roberts C.G. Ladenson P.W. Lancet. 2004; 363: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Furthermore, administration of thyroid hormone efficiently lowers plasma cholesterol levels in rodent models and also in humans (9Aviram M. Luboshitzky R. Brook J.G. Clin. Biochem. 1982; 15: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Engelken S.F. Eaton R.P. Atherosclerosis. 1981; 38: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). T3 regulates cholesterol homeostasis by affecting the expression of key hepatic proteins, such as the low density lipoprotein receptor and the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. Using transgenic mice, Gullberg and co-workers (11Gullberg H. Rudling M. Salto C. Forrest D. Angelin B. Vennstrom B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that T3 regulates cholesterol homeostasis in mice in a TRβ-dependent manner. In addition, those authors showed that TRβ regulates the transcription of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis (12Gullberg H. Rudling M. Forrest D. Angelin B. Vennstrom B. Mol.

Scanlan T.S. Dillmann W.H. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3057-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This strong effect is explained, at least in part, by a stimulation of the reverse cholesterol transport: increase of high density lipoprotein selective uptake in the liver by SR-B1 and a subsequent increase in cholesterol catabolism through Cyp7A activation (13Johansson L. Rudling M. Scanlan T.S. Lundasen T. Webb P. Baxter J. Angelin B. Parini P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10297-10302Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TRβ activation by thyromimetics has been shown to lower plasma triglyceride levels in various rodent models (14Ness G.C. Lopez D. Chambers C.M. Newsome W.P. Cornelius P. Long C.A. Harwood Jr., H.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Taylor A.H. Stephan Z.F. Steele R.E. Wong N.C. Mol.

In hypothyroid patients, serum levels of TG-rich lipoprotein were reported to be increased (17Abrams J.J. Grundy S.M. Ginsberg H. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 307-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Ito et al. (18Ito M. Takamatsu J. Matsuo T. Kameoka K. Kubota S. Fukata S. Tamai H. Miyauchi A. Kuma K. Hanafusa T. Clin. Endocrinol. (Oxf). 2003; 58: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that administration of T4 to patients with hypothyroidism led to a strong decrease in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and also triglyceride levels. This decrease was accompanied by a significant increase in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. In another study, Nikkila and Kekki (19Nikkila E.A. Kekki M. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 2103-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) found that postheparin LPL activity is increased in hyperthyroid state and decreased in hypothyroidism. Finally, Abrams et al. (17Abrams J.J. Grundy S.M. Ginsberg H. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 307-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed that hyperthyroid patients have remarkable facility in clearing VLDL-TG without any significant changes in LPL activity. Altogether, these reports suggest that thyroid hormone influences triglyceride metabolism, but the precise molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Recently, novel regulators of LPL activity have been identified. Angiopoietin-like proteins are proteins containing a coiled-coil domain and a fibrinogen-like domain similar to those found in angiopoietins (20Oike Y. Akao M. Kubota Y. Suda T. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). Six members of this growing family have been described so far (for a review, see Ref. 20Oike Y. Akao M. Kubota Y. Suda T. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to their angiogenic properties in the vasculature, members of this family have been found to play a role in metabolism (20Oike Y. Akao M. Kubota Y. Suda T. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). ANGPTL3 was identified by genetic analysis of the KK/San mice that present low plasma lipid levels despite being hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic (21Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Administration or overexpression of ANGPTL3 using adenovirus elicited a marked increase in circulating plasma total cholesterol, nonesterified fatty acid levels and TGs (21Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). ANGPTL3 regulates VLDL-TG levels by inhibiting LPL activity (22Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yoshida K. Ando Y. Koishi R. Ueda K. Inaba T. Minekura H. Kohama T. Furukawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33742-33748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Another study also proposed that ANGPTL3 may be able to target adipocytes to activate lipolysis, thereby enhancing the release of free fatty acids and glycerol (23Shimamura M. Matsuda M. Kobayashi S. Ando Y. Ono M. Koishi R. Furukawa H. Makishima M. Shimomura I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). More recently, a significant genetic association was found between ANGPTL3 and the development of atherosclerosis lesions in both mice and humans (24Korstanje R. Eriksson P. Samnegard A. Olsson P.G.

The patients carrying the mutated ANGPTL3 allele had higher circulating TG levels (24Korstanje R. Eriksson P. Samnegard A. Olsson P.G. Forsman-Semb K. Sen S. Churchill G.A. Rollins J. Harris S. Hamsten A. Paigen B. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 177: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Another member of the Angiopoietin-like proteins, ANGPTL4, has also been found to inhibit LPL activity (25Yoshida K. Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Furukawa H. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1770-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This gene, also called PGAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated angiopoietin-related protein) or FIAF (fasting-induced adipose factor), is tightly regulated in the liver and in the adipose tissue after feeding and fasting, suggesting a role in fat metabolism (26Kersten S. Mandard S. Tan N.S. Escher P. Metzger D. Chambon P. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28488-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice overexpressing ANGPTL4 in the heart showed a significant reduction in cardiac LPL activity and a subsequent inhibition in lipoprotein-derived free fatty acid delivery to the heart (27Yu X. Burgess S.C. Ge H. Wong K.K. Nassem R.H. Garry D.J. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Berger J.P. Li C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the potential involvement of thyroid hormone in ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 gene regulation. ANGPTL3, but not ANGPTL4, was found to be regulated specifically by TRβ in vivo. Furthermore, we show that TRβ negatively regulates this gene by, at least in part, antagonizing the HNF1α transcriptional pathway in a DNA binding-independent manner. Materials—T3 was obtained from Sigma. Charcoal/dextran-treated FBS was from Hyclone. The TRβ-selective agonist GC-1 (16Trost S.U. Swanson E. Gloss B. Wang-Iverson D.B. Zhang H. Volodarsky T.

Cell Culture—HepG2 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in basic Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Plasmids—The plasmids pSG5-TRβ and GAL4-TRβ (containing the human TRβ ligand-binding domain cloned in frame with the DBD of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor) were provided by Dr. J. Moore (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC). The pSG5 plasmid was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The G5-Luc reporter vector containing five copies of the GAL4 response element cloned upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter was provided by Promega. The human ANGPTL3 promoter constructs (–929 to +109, –296 to +109, –171 to +109, and –66 to +109) were obtained by PCR amplification using human genomic DNA (Clontech) as template. The resulting PCR products were inserted as BglII/HindIII fragments into pGL3 basic vector (Promega), yielding –929 to +109, –296 to +109, –171 to +109, and –66 to +109 ANGPTL3-Luc. The mutation of the LXR and HNF1 binding sites within the –929 to +109 ANGPTL3 promoter were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The GAL4-HNF1α construct was obtained by PCR amplification of full-length HNF1α using a human liver cDNA library (Clontech) as template. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned in frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain into the pM vector (Clontech), yielding GAL4-HNF1α. All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Transient Transfection Assays—HepG2 cells, plated in 96-well plates at 50–60% confluence in basic Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, were transiently transfected with reporter and receptor expression plasmids using Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) as indicated in the legends for Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The pSEAP2 expression plasmid (Clontech) was cotransfected to assess transfection efficiency. 24 h post-transfection, cells were refed with fresh medium containing 1% charcoal/dextran-treated serum and TR ligands or vehicle (Me2SO or 0.1% ethanol). 24 h later, cells were collected and assayed for luciferase and alkaline phosphatase activities. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E.FIGURE 4TRβ represses ANGPTL3 promoter activity in a DNA binding-independent manner.

Male Wistar rats (12 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Hypothyroidism was induced by administration by gavage of a 10-mg/kg/day 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) aqueous solution (Sigma) for 3 weeks. On the last day of the treatment, half of the PTU-treated rats received an intraperitoneal injection of L-T3 (300 μg/kg in 100 μlof PBS). 6 h postinjection, animals were sacrificed, and livers were excised for RNA preparation. Adult 8–10-week-old males TRα0/0 (29Gauthier K. Plateroti M. Harvey C.B. Williams G.R. Weiss R.E. Refetoff S. Willott J.F. Sundin V. Roux J.P. Malaval L. Hara M. Samarut J. Chassande O. Mol. Cell.

Mice were housed and maintained with approval from the animal experimental committee of the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon (Lyon, France). Briefly, for each genotype, control animals were fed standard mouse chow. TH deficiency was induced by feeding a low iodine diet supplemented with 0.15% PTU purchased from Harlan/Teklad and 0.05% methimazole into the drinking water. The day before the sacrifice (5 pm), one-half of the PTU-treated mice received an intraperitoneal injection of T3 (300 μg/kg in 100 μl of PBS). The PTU- and TH-treated mice were sacrificed at the end of the night cycle after an overnight fasting. At the conclusion of each experiment, blood was recovered for serum preparation, and the liver was quickly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and used for RNA extraction. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was treated with DNase I (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by inactivation at 75 °C for 5 min. Real time quantitative PCR assays were performed using an Applied Biosystems 7900 sequence detector. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed with random hexamers using a Taqman reverse transcription reagent kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA expression levels were determined by Sybr green assays as described (31Delerive P. Galardi C.M. Bisi J.E. Nicodeme E. Goodwin B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2378-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). β-Actin transcript was used as an internal control to normalize the variations for RNA amounts. Gene expression levels are expressed relative to β-actin mRNA levels. All of the PCR primers used in the present study are available upon request. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-GCTTAATGATTAACT-3′) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to standard procedures. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (32Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 33Dignam D.R. Healthc. Financ. Manage. 1983; 37: 38-40PubMed Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined using the BCA kit (Bio-Rad). 5 μg of extracts were incubated with 100,000 cpm of labeled probe for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.3 μg bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE buffer. The gel was then dried and exposed at –80 °C for autoradiography. In order to study a potential involvement of thyroid hormone in ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 gene regulation, male Wistar rats were rendered hypothyroid using a 3-week PTU treatment. This treatment induced a dramatic fall in both T4 and T3 levels. Animals then received T3 by intraperitoneal injection or vehicle (PBS). Hepatic gene expression was monitored 6 h later by real time quantitative PCR (Fig. 1). As expected, T3 injection resulted in a significant induction of SPOT14 gene expression (3.5-fold) in the hypothyroid rats in agreement with previous reports (34Flores-Morales A. Gullberg H. Fernandez L. Stahlberg N. Lee N.H. Vennstrom B. Norstedt G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ANGPTL3, but not ANGPTL4, gene expression was markedly down-regulated by the treatment (–70%), suggesting a role for thyroid hormone in the control of ANGPTL3 expression in vivo. To determine which TR isotype mediates this effect, we next measured ANGPTL3 gene expression in WT, TRα KO, and TRβ KO mice that had been subjected to PTU treatment for 3 weeks. At the end of this treatment, hypothyroid mice received T3 (300 μg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. 16 h later, mice were sacrificed, and hepatic gene expressions were monitored by Sybrman analysis (Fig. 2). As expected, SPOT14 was strongly (60-fold) induced in WT and TRα KO mice, but not in TRβ KO mice (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with previous reports (34Flores-Morales A. Gullberg H. Fernandez L. Stahlberg N. Lee N.H. Vennstrom B. Norstedt G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). ANGPTL3 mRNA levels were significantly diminished after T3 injections in both WT and TRα KO mice. By contrast, this repressive effect of T3 on ANGPTL3 expression was not observed in TRβ-deficient animals (Fig. 2B). Finally, as a control, liver ANGPTL4 mRNA levels were not significantly affected by T3 injection (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that ANGPTL3 is negatively regulated by T3 in vivo in a TRβ-dependent manner. In order to understand by which mechanism TRβ regulates ANGPTL3 gene expression, a 1-kb fragment of the promoter was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene. A functional analysis of this promoter was then carried out in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3). Preliminary experiments revealed that HepG2 cells express extremely low TRβ levels, as demonstrated by Taqman analysis (data not shown) and in line with previous reports (35Shin D.J. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34114-34118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 36Xiong S. Chirala S.S. Hsu M.H. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12260-12265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the absence of co-transfected TRβ, treatment with T3 or thyromimetics (GC-1 and CGS-23425) did not significantly affect ANGPTL3 promoter activity (Fig. 3A). Co-transfection of TRβ in the absence of ligand resulted in a small but significant inhibition of the reporter gene activity. This effect was potentiated by the addition of the different agonists, resulting in a 10-fold repression of the promoter activity (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, this ligand-induced transcriptional inhibition was dose-dependent, as demonstrated on Fig. 3B. This inhibition is also specific, since co-transfection of another nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, in the presence or absence of its synthetic ligand, failed to suppress ANGPTL3 promoter activity (data not shown). Taken together, the results indicate that T3 regulates ANGTPL3 at the transcriptional level. Since T3 has also been shown to regulate gene expression via mRNA destabilization (37Staton J.M. Leedman P.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1093-1100Cros"
https://openalex.org/W2129114605,"αLβ2 affinity for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is regulated by the conformation of the αL I domain, which is in turn controlled by the conformation and orientation of other adjacent domains. Additionally, overall integrin conformation (bent versus straightened) influences the orientation of the I domain and access to its ligands, influencing adhesive efficiency. The open or high affinity I domain conformation supports strong adhesion, whereas the closed, low affinity conformation mediates weak interactions or rolling. We have previously suggested that αLβ2 can also exist on the cell surface in an intermediate affinity state. Here we have studied the adhesive properties of integrin αLβ2 containing mutant I domains with intermediate affinities for ICAM-1. In an overall bent conformation, the intermediate affinity state of αLβ2 is hardly detected by conventional adhesion assays, but robust adhesion is seen when an extended conformation is induced by a small molecule α/β I allo-steric antagonist. Intermediate affinity αLβ2 supports more stable rolling than wild-type αLβ2 under shear tions. Moreover, antagonist-induced extension conditransforms rolling adhesion into firm adhesion in a manner reminiscent of chemokine activation of integrin αLβ2. These findings suggest the relevance of intermediate affinity states of αLβ2 to the transition between inactive and active states and demonstrate the importance of both I domain affinity and overall integrin conformation for cell adhesion. αLβ2 affinity for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is regulated by the conformation of the αL I domain, which is in turn controlled by the conformation and orientation of other adjacent domains.

Integrins are cell membrane proteins that integrate the extracellular and intracellular compartments by binding to ligands on other cells or on the extracellular matrix. Integrins contain two noncovalently associated, transmembrane glycoprotein α and β subunits. A globular headpiece binds ligand, and two long leg regions connect the ligand binding headpiece to the transmembrane and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. Half of integrin α subunits, including αL, contain a domain of ∼200 amino acids, known as an inserted (I) or von Willebrand factor A domain that contains the major ligand binding site. Integrin αLβ2, also known as leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), 4The abbreviations used are: LFA-1, leukocyte function-associated antigen-1; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1. is expressed on leukocytes and participates in leukocyte trafficking in inflammation, lymphocyte homing, and T lymphocyte interactions with antigen-presenting cells in immune reactions. The conformational state of the I domain in the αL subunit strongly influences its affinity for ligand. A downward movement of the C-terminal α-helix of the I domain, linked to conformational rearrangements at the metal ion-dependent adhesion site that constitutes the binding site, is seen in the ICAM-1-bound structure of the αL I domain (1Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.-D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A.

This conformation is termed open and has been engineered by locking the loop between the C-terminal β-strand and α-helix into the open conformation using a disulfide bond. The open I domain, both in isolation or in the context of intact αLβ2, can support firm adhesion to ICAM-1 that is comparable with activated, wild-type αLβ2 (2Shimaoka M. Lu C.

Open table in a new tab Besides the α I domain, integrin ectodomains contain four other domains in the α subunit and eight domains in the β subunit. In addition to conformational change in the I domain, integrins undergo large changes in the overall shape of the ectodomain. On physiological cell surfaces, integrins that lack I domains have been shown to assume multiple conformations with distinct affinity states, with the bent conformation in which the head folds over the legs because of a bend at the knees, being the predominant conformation for integrins in the resting, low affinity state (5Springer T.A. Wang J.-h. Cell Surface Receptors.in: Garcia K.C. 68. Elsevier, San Diego, CA2004: 29-63Google Scholar). Physiological signals that impinge on integrin cytoplasmic domains, as well as certain activating mAbs, alter the equilibrium between different conformational states and trigger extension. For integrins that lack I domains, two extended conformations that differ in the conformation of their heads and in affinity for ligand have been visualized by electron microscopy and in crystal structures (5Springer T.A. Wang J.-h. Cell Surface Receptors.in: Garcia K.C. 68. Elsevier, San Diego, CA2004: 29-63Google Scholar). On the cell surface, I domains may exist in the three conformations termed closed, intermediate, and open, as seen in crystal structures. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that αLβ2 can mediate adhesive interactions even when high affinity ligand binding cannot be detected (6Kim M. Carman C.V. Yang W. Salas A. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This cannot be explained by avidity regulation, implying the physiologic importance of intermediate affinity states. However, intermediate affinity states (with μm KD), which were first suggested in phorbol myristyl acetate-stimulated T cells, are difficult to detect using conventional ligand binding assays (7Lollo B.A. Chan K.W. Hanson E.M. Moy V.T. Brian A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21693-21700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we introduce three different intermediate affinity mutations into αLβ2 expressed in K562 cells and assess their impact on αLβ2 adhesion to ICAM-1. The affinity and kinetics for the binding to ICAM-1 of isolated I domains with the same mutations have previously been measured (1Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.-D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that intermediate affinity, in contrast to high affinity, is on its own insufficient to result in strong adhesion. Nevertheless, intermediate affinity increases the frequency of tethering and supports more stable rolling interactions. By using an αLβ2 α/β I allosteric inhibitor that induces αLβ2 extension (8Shimaoka M. Salas A. Yang W. Weitz-Schmidt G. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and has been shown to facilitate rolling by wild-type αLβ2 (9Salas A. Shimaoka M. Kogan A.N. Harwood C. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 393-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that, for the intermediate affinity state, integrin extension induces transition from rolling to firm adhesion in a way that is reminiscent of in situ activation by chemokines (10Campbell J.J. Hedrick J. Zlotnik A. Siani M.A. Thompson D.A. Butcher E.C. Science. 1998; 279: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that an intermediate affinity I domain, when in the context of extended α and β subunits, is sufficient to support cell arrest and firm adhesion on ICAM-1 surfaces. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Small Molecule Inhibitors—Overlap extension PCR was used to generate cysteine substitution mutations in intact αL, as described previously (3Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). K562 cells were stably transfected with K160C/F299C-αL, K160C/T300C-αL, L161C/F299C-αL, or L161C/T300C-αL in pcDNA3.1(hygro) together with wild-type β2 and then selected in 200 μg/ml hygromycin. The 1% highest expressing cells were sorted by immunofluorescent flow cytometry into 96-well plates at ∼1 cell/well. Wells with an outgrowth of a single colony were retested by immunofluorescence, and clones with similar expression to wild-type and high affinity transfectants were expanded and frozen in liquid N2. Clones were maintained in medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin. For each mutant, all results shown are for the same clone, and only one clone was tested. Similar αLβ2 surface expression as wild-type was selected and routinely verified by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. K562 cells stably transfected with wild-type αLβ2 or K287C/K294C-αL/β2 (high affinity) in pEF(puro) were as described previously (3Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). K562 transfectants were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 3 μg/ml puromycin (wild-type αLβ2 and high affinity αLβ2) or 200 μg/ml hygromycin for the rest of the mutants. A non-binding mouse IgG1 (X63) as control, an anti-human αL I domain mAb (TS1/22), an αL β-propeller domain mAb (TS2/4), and an anti-β2 I-like domain mAb (TS1/18) were used to determine surface expression of the transfectants by immunofluorescent flow cytometry or to specifically block αLβ2-ICAM-1 interactions (11Lu C.

Soluble ICAM-1 Binding Assay—K562 transfectants were washed with HBS (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) containing 5 mm EDTA and resuspended in HBS buffer containing the indicated cation concentrations. To induce activation, wild-type αLβ2 cells were pre-incubated with 10 μg/ml CBR LFA-1/2 for 15 min. In some experiments, cells were pre-incubated with 10 μg/ml αI blocking mAb TS1/22 or isotype mouse IgG control X63 before the addition of ICAM-1. Binding of dimeric soluble ICAM-1 was assayed as follows. A chimera containing the five Ig domains of human ICAM-1 fused to the Fc portion of IgA (ICAM-1-Fcα) (17Martin S. Casasnovas J.M. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the cells at 50 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To test the effect of XVA143 and BIRT377 on soluble ICAM-1-Fcα binding to the K562 transfectants, cells were pre-incubated with 0.001% Me2SO, 1 μm XVA143, or 10 μm BIRT377 for 10 min at 22 °C. The cells were washed and incubated with a 1:100 dilution of goat anti-human IgA-FITC (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry. In another series of experiments, multimeric ICAM-1 complexes were prepared by mixing ICAM-1-Fcα with affinity-purified goat anti-human IgA antibody labeled with FITC (1:10 w/w) and incubated at 22 °C for 30 min. The mixture (4 μl) was then added to 50 μl of transfected cells to yield final concentrations of 50 μg/ml anti-human IgA-FITC and 5 μg/ml ICAM-1-Fcα and incubated for 30 min at 22 °C. The cells were washed and subjected to immunofluorescence flow cytometry. Cell Adhesion to Immobilized ICAM-1 under Shear Flow—Cell adhesion in a parallel wall flow chamber was quantified as described previously (9Salas A. Shimaoka M. Kogan A.N. Harwood C. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 393-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A chimera containing the five immunoglobulin domains of human ICAM-1 fused to the Fc portion of IgG (ICAM-1-Fcγ) was a kind gift from Dr. Lloyd Klickstein (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). When indicated, Me2SO (0.001%) as control or XVA143 (1 μm) was added to the cells immediately before infusion into the flow chamber. V-bottom Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion to a V-bottom-well plate was assayed as described previously (18Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Briefly, V-bottom 96-well plates (Corning) were coated with affinity-purified human tonsil ICAM-1 or with bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were labeled for 15 min at 37 °C with 2′,7′-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes), washed, resuspended in L-15 medium/2.5% fetal calf serum (3 × 104 cells in 50 μl), and when indicated, incubated for 15 min with 1 mm MnCl2. The cells were added to the plates and immediately centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 min at room temperature. Flat Bottom Cell Adhesion Assay—Binding of the transfectants to immobilized ICAM-1 was as described previously (12Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells and plates (96-well flat bottom plates; Corning) were prepared as described above. In some experiments, wild-type αLβ2 transfectants were pre-incubated with 10 μg/ml CBR LFA-1/2, Me2SO (0.001%), BIRT377 (10 μm), or XVA143 (1 μm) for 15 min. Cells were added to the plates in 100 μl of L15/2.5% fetal calf serum with the indicated agents. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, unbound cells were washed off using a plate washer and fluorescence read. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed when indicated using Student's unpaired t test. Values are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Characterization of Intermediate Affinity αLβ2 Mutants and Adhesion to ICAM-1—Measurements of the solution affinity for ICAM-1 of different double cysteine mutants of the αL I domain (1Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.-D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A.

A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) show that they can be classified as low affinity (wild-type and K160C/T300C), intermediate affinity (L161C/T300C, K160C/F299, L161C/F299C), and high affinity (K287C/K294C) (Table 1). To correlate the solution affinity with adhesive behavior, the mutations were introduced into the full-length αL subunit. K562 cells were stably transfected with the double cysteine αL I domain substitution mutants together with wild-type β2. In preliminary experiments, two to three clonal cell lines expressing each mutant were tested in shear flow assays. No significant differences in rolling versus firm adhesion behavior was seen among clones of the same mutant. In all subsequent experiments, one clone for each mutant with the most similar expression to the wild-type αLβ2, as revealed by staining with an anti-β2 β-propeller mAb TS2/4 (Fig. 1) and an anti-β2 I-like domain mAb TS1/18 (data not shown), was selected. The previously described high affinity (K287C/K294C)-αL/β2 mutant (3Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was expressed on transfectants 50–70% as well as the others. Transfectants were tested for their ability to bind to immobilized human ICAM-1 in a flat bottom or a V-well assay. As previously described, adhesion of K562 transfectants expressing wild-type αLβ2 is hardly detectable in flat bottom adhesion assays when cells are incubated at room temperature (22 °C) (data not shown) (19Yang W. Shimaoka M. Salas A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2906-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and <10% of the cells adhere at 37 °C (Fig. 2A) (4Lu C.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2906-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or an activating antibody, CBR LFA-1/2, greatly increases adhesion to levels seen with high affinity (K287C/K294C)-αL/β2 (Fig. 2A) (4Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 19Yang W. Shimaoka M. Salas A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2906-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As expected, adhesion to immobilized ICAM-1 of K562 cells expressing the low affinity K160C/T300C-αL/β2 mutant was as low as that of wild-type αLβ2 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, none of the cells transfected with intermediate affinity αLβ2 mutants showed significantly higher binding to immobilized ICAM-1 in this assay (Fig. 2A). This contrasted with the higher affinity for ICAM-1 of the same mutations in isolated I domains as measured with surface plasmon resonance (Table 1). We next explored the ability of the K562 transfectants expressing αLβ2 mutants to bind to immobilized ICAM-1 under less stringent conditions than those of the flat bottom assay. In the V-well assay, cells are spun down at 200 × g and are never subjected to washing. Non-adherent cells roll or slide to the bottom of the V under centrifugal force, whereas adherent cells remain evenly distributed on the V-well bottom. The V-well assay detects lower affinity or avidity states that cannot be detected by conventional flat bottom assay or soluble ligand binding (6Kim M. Carman C.V. Yang W. Salas A. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 18Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In the V-well assay, ∼40–50% of the high affinity αLβ2 transfectants or Mn2+ -treated wild-type αLβ2 transfectants bound to the ICAM-1-coated wells, whereas the wild-type and low affinity K160C/T300C-αL/β2 transfectants were significantly less adherent (Fig. 2B). Despite the less stringent conditions of this assay, among the intermediate affinity mutants, significant adhesion (p < .05) was seen only with L161C/F299C (Fig. 2B), which has the highest affinity for ICAM-1 of the three intermediate affinity mutants (Table 1). Binding of Soluble Dimeric and Multimeric ICAM-1-Fcα to Intermediate Affinity αLβ2 Mutants—For comparison to the cell adhesion assay results, we examined binding of soluble ligands using dimeric or multimeric soluble ICAM-1-Fcα and fluorescent flow cytometry. In contrast to the cell adhesion assays, soluble ligand binding by αLβ2 transfectants (Fig. 3) correlated well with previous affinity measurements on purified I domains (Table 1). The panels in Fig. 3, A and B, are arranged in the same order as the affinities in Table 1. The rank order of these affinities in Table 1 is entirely concordant with the rank order of binding of dimeric and multimeric ICAM-1-Fcα in Fig. 3. Activation of wild-type αLβ2 with CBR LFA-1/2 mAb induced binding of ICAM-1-Fcα similar to the K287C/K294C mutant. Blocking by TS1/22 abrogated binding of dimeric and multimeric ICAM-1-Fcα to all of the transfectants studied, supporting the specificity of the binding. Binding of Intermediate Affinity Mutants to Immobilized ICAM-1 in the Presence of Shear Forces—Both the isolated wild-type αL I domain and αLβ2 on the cell surface can mediate weak adhesion and rolling when low shear forces are applied (20Knorr R. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Sigal A. Bleijs D.A. Grabovsky V. van Vliet S.J. Dwir O. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Alon R. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50255-50262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), despite the lack of binding in standard adhesion assays (Figs. 2 and 3) (2Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R. von Andrian U.H. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 3Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown (22Salas A. Shimaoka M. Chen S. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50255-50262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that wild-type αLβ2 mediates mostly weak, rolling interactions under shear forces and that activated αLβ2 or the high affinity mutant supports primarily firm adhesion that is resistant to high shear forces, as confirmed here (Fig. 4). Examination of the low and intermediate affinity mutants showed that adhesion in shear flow was correlated with affinity (Fig. 4). The low affinity mutant, which exhibits a 3-fold affinity increase over wild-type, exhibited more rolling cells than wild-type (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the three intermediate affinity mutants all showed a mixture of rolling and firmly adherent cells under basal conditions, in contrast to rolling by the low affinity mutant and firm adhesion by the high affinity mutant (Fig. 4). Differential Effect of the α/β I Allosteric Antagonist XVA143 on Low, Intermediate, and High Affinity Mutants—The small molecule αLβ2 antagonist XVA143 binds in a metal-dependent fashion to the β2 I-like domain and induces extension of the integrin legs, as shown by activation epitope exposure. XVA143 blocks activation of the αL I domain by the β2 I domain and therefore inhibits ligand binding by wild-type αLβ2 but not high affinity mutant αLβ2 (8Shimaoka M. Salas A. Yang W. Weitz-Schmidt G. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), or as shown below, intermediate affinity I domain mutants. Binding of XVA143 and extension of αLβ2 is reflected by the exposure of activation-dependent epitopes in the β2 I-like and integrin epidermal growth factor-like 2 domains detected by the antibodies m24 and KIM127, respectively (8Shimaoka M. Salas A. Yang W. Weitz-Schmidt G. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Salas A. Shimaoka M. Kogan A.N. Harwood C. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 393-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The mutations used here to introduce disulfide bonds into the αL I domain did not interfere with exposure by XVA143 of the m24 activation epitope in the β2 I domain or the KIM127 activation epitope in the integrin epidermal growth factor-like 2 domain in the β2 leg (Fig. 1). Thus, binding of this small molecule and extension of αLβ2 are not impaired by the αL I domain cysteine substitutions. XVA143 had an effect on the intermediate affinity mutants, unlike that seen on other classes of mutants (Fig. 5). For all three intermediate affinity mutants, XVA143 promoted a marked increase in the total number of firmly adherent cells that were bound and remained attached under shear forces (Fig. 5). As previously reported (9Salas A. Shimaoka M. Kogan A.N. Harwood C. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 393-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), XVA143 enhanced rolling by wild-type αLβ2 and had no effect on the high affinity mutant. These results suggest that, when αLβ2 has intermediate affinity for ligand, extension is a major factor influencing the strength of the adhesion. This may be similar to the case with wild-type αLβ2, where extension greatly promotes rolling (Fig. 5) (9Salas A. Shimaoka M. Kogan A.N. Harwood C. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 393-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to intermediate affinity mutants, extension of the wild-type or low affinity mutant was not sufficient to promote firm adhesion (Fig. 5). Following up on these findings, we tested the hypothesis that XVA143 could induce adhesion by the intermediate affinity mutants in the flat bottom assay described above. Indeed, incubation with XVA143 induced a significant increase in adhesion mediated by the intermediate affinity αLβ2 mutants but had no effect on the low affinity mutant K160C/T300C-αL/β2 (Fig. 6). In keeping with our previous findings (9Salas A. Shimaoka M. Kogan A.N. Harwood C. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2004; 20: 393-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), XVA143 abrogated binding mediated by resting and activated wild-type αLβ2, but as expected for an allosteric inhibitor, had no effect on adhesion mediated by the high affinity K287C/K294C-αL/β2-transfected cells (Fig. 6). As a contrast, we tested the effect of the small molecule BIRT377, which belongs to the α I allosteric class of inhibitors that stabilize the closed conformation of the αL I domain and do not induce extension of αLβ2 (8Shimaoka M.

BIRT377 did not increase binding by the intermediate affinity αLβ2 transfectants and, if anything, slightly decreased their binding (Fig. 6). As expected, BIRT377 completely blocks adhesion mediated by the resting or activated wild-type αLβ2 and had no effect on the high affinity K287C/K294C-αL/β2 mutant (Fig. 6). A structural picture of integrin activation is emerging from crystal, NMR, and electron microscopy studies (5Springer T.A. Wang J.-h. Cell Surface Receptors.in: Garcia K.C. 68. Elsevier, San Diego, CA2004: 29-63Google Scholar). Studies on integrins that lack I domains demonstrate at least three distinct conformational states: a bent conformation with the β I domain in the closed conformation, an extended conformation with the β I domain in the closed conformation, and an extended conformation with the β I domain in the open conformation. Integrins that contain I domains appear to undergo analogous extension and opening of the β I domain, with additional complexities because of the presence of the α I domain and evidence that it can exist in three conformational states (1Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.-D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A.

Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 2137-2147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In wild-type αLβ2, it is likely that extension and β I domain opening would be a requirement for or coupled in a yet-undefined manner to α I domain conformational transitions. Currently, there is highly suggestive, but indirect, evidence in favor of an intermediate affinity state during physiologic activation of wild-type αLβ2. That is, adhesion and binding to multivalent soluble ligands throughαLβ2 is stimulated in the absence of any change in clustering and in the absence of high affinity monomeric ligand binding (6Kim M. Carman C.V. Yang W. Salas A. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Highly sensitive ligand binding assays do detect a stimulated increase in monovalent affinity by cell surface αLβ2; however, they do not discriminate between a small subpopulation of high affinity αLβ2 or a larger population of intermediate affinity αLβ2 molecules (7Lollo B.A. Chan K.W. Hanson E.M. Moy V.T. Brian A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21693-21700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, modeling the intermediate affinity state with mutants has allowed us to demonstrate that an intermediate affinity state is capable of supporting cell adhesion, and use of an antagonist that induces extension has also enabled us to show that I domain affinity and integrin extension each contribute to integrin adhesiveness. Remarkably, the presence within an αLβ2 heterodimer of an intermediate affinity (KD ∼3–10 μm) I domain per se does not result in high adhesion to ICAM-1 as measured here by flat bottom and V-well bottom adhesion assays. By contrast, soluble dimeric and multimeric ligand binding was readily detected. These differences are attributable to the greater importance of integrin orientation for adhesion than soluble ligand binding. The KIM127 mAb recognizes an epitope in the β2 leg in integrin epidermal growth factor-like 2 domain that is buried in the bent conformation and exposed in the extended conformation (11Lu C.

Staining with these mAbs suggested that the low affinity and intermediate affinity mutants studied here, similar to the previously characterized high affinity mutant, basally assume predominantly the bent conformation with a closed β I domain. An important contrast was noted with αLβ2 containing a high affinity mutant I domain; even though it adopted predominantly a bent conformation, it supported adhesion in the flat well and V-well assays that was strong and indistinguishable from activated wild-type αLβ2. The parallel wall flow assay was more sensitive than the flat well or V-well assays in detecting adhesiveness. The K160C/T300C mutant with 3-fold higher affinity than wild-type, classed here as low affinity, showed enhanced rolling compared with wild-type and few or no firmly adherent cells. The three intermediate affinity mutants showed a marked increase in accumulation on the substrate at 0.3 dyn/cm2 compared with wild-type and the presence of both firmly adherent and rolling cells over a wide range of shear stresses. The percentage of rollingly adherent cells increased with shear. By contrast, essentially only firm adhesion was seen with the high affinity mutant at all wall shear stresses. These findings demonstrated a clear correlation between adhesive phenotype in shear flow and I domain affinity, predominant rolling with low affinity, mixed rolling and firm adhesion with intermediate affinity, and only firm adhesion with high affinity. We found that integrin extension also makes an important contribution to adhesive phenotype. The α/β I allosteric antagonist XVA143 induced β I domain opening and extension of all of the mutants studied here, as shown with the m24 and KIM127 epitopes. This antagonist binds to the β I domain and blocks activation of the α I domain in wild-type αLβ2; it has no direct effect on I domains (8Shimaoka M. Salas A. Yang W. Weitz-Schmidt G. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Welzenbach K. Hommel U. Weitz-Schmidt G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10590-10598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Modulation of I domain affinity, but not induction of extension, are abolished when the position of the α I domain C-terminal helix is stabilized with a mutationally introduced disulfide bond (8Shimaoka M. Salas A. Yang W. Weitz-Schmidt G. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). When predominantly in the bent conformation, αLβ2 heterodimers containing intermediate affinity I domains were inactive in conventional flat well adhesion assays. After small molecule-induced extension, all three intermediate affinity mutants mediated robust adhesion, whereas the low affinity mutant did not. Thus intermediate affinity and integrin extension alone are insufficient (but together are sufficient) to mediate adhesion. The effect of extension on adhesiveness in shear flow of intermediate affinity αLβ2 mutants was unique. The low affinity mutant mediated rolling adhesion with or without small molecule-induced extension, and the high affinity mutant supported only firm adhesion with or without extension. By contrast, small molecule-induced extension triggered a substantial shift of all three intermediate affinity mutants from rolling adhesion to firm adhesion. Previously, we had shown that extension substantially increased rolling through wild-type αLβ2, which exists basally in a low affinity state. In contrast, the current results demonstrate that extension alters the adhesive phenotype for the intermediate affinity state. Our findings have several important implications for integrin regulation in vivo. To date, it has generally been assumed that there should be a correlation between the activity of integrins in cell adhesion assays and integrin avidity as measured by binding of soluble, multivalent ligands. Our results show that this is not the case when overall integrin conformation changes; integrin extension greatly increases firm adhesion, particularly for integrins with intermediate affinity. Integrin extension appears to be the first step in activation of the extracellular domain in inside-out signaling. Separation of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains causes separation of the lower α and β subunit legs, which destabilizes their interface with the headpiece and converts the bent conformation to the extended conformation (5Springer T.A. Wang J.-h. Cell Surface Receptors.in: Garcia K.C. 68. Elsevier, San Diego, CA2004: 29-63Google Scholar, 18Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Opening of the β I domain is not hindered in the extended conformation as it is in the bent conformation; however, neither is there any mechanism in the extended conformation to favor opening of the β I domain. Other processes or interactions would be required to actively stabilize the open β I domain, which in turn would stabilize the open, high affinity α I domain. In vivo and in vitro, chemokines activate the arrest of rolling cells in <1 s (10Campbell J.J. Hedrick J. Zlotnik A. Siani M.A. Thompson D.A. Butcher E.C. Science. 1998; 279: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The available structural data and the results described here suggest that extension of αLβ2 and an intermediate affinity, intermediate conformation of the αL I domain are sufficient to mediate the arrest of rolling cells and that a high affinity, open conformation of the αL I domain is not required.

We find that S2-HR2 forms a symmetric coiled coil trimer in solution. Importantly, this structure provides the first structural evidence for the prefusion state of SARS-CoV envelope. Moreover, the S2-HR2 structure provides a framework for the design of novel peptides that inhibit viral entry.

Subsequently, the cells were pelleted, washed one time with M9 minimal medium, resuspended in 1 liter of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 g/liter of 15NH4Cl (Martek Biosciences, Columbia, MD) and 4 g/liter of 13C-glucose (Isotec, Miamisburg, OH), set to recover for 1 h at 37°C, induced with 0.8 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 4-5 h at 37 °C. The His-PG-S2-HR2 fusion protein was purified from the soluble fraction using a Ni2+ fast flow Sepharose column (Qiagen). The protein was then cleaved using tobacco etch virus protease and run once more over the Ni2+ column to remove His-PG and tobacco etch virus protease, which also contains a polyhistidine tag. The flow through fraction containing S2-HR2 was then dialyzed extensively against 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM3; Amicon, Billerica, MA). The purity and identity of S2-HR2 were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. NMR Spectroscopy—For the NMR experiments, the experimental conditions were 1 mm S2-HR2 in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 30% TFE-d3 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA), and 10% 2H2O. NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Buker AVANCE 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe. The spectra were processed by NmrPipe and visualized with NmrDraw (44Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). Backbone assignments were determined using a standard set of three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments including: HNCO, CBCA-(CO)NH and CBCANH (45Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 46Jiang S. Caffrey M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The side chain resonances were assigned by three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC, threedimensional HCC(CO)NH, and three-dimensional CC(CO)NH experiments. A three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (mixing time, 120 ms) was acquired for structural restraint information as well as confirmation of side chain assignments. An additional HNHA experiment was performed to add 3JHNα information (47Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The intersubunit NOEs were identified by recording a three-dimensional F1-filtered, F2-edited 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC with a mixing time of 120 ms (48Stuart A.C. Borzilleri K.A. Withka J.M. Palmer A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5346-5347Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) on a 1 mm sample comprised of a mixture of 50% 14N/12C-labeled and 50% 15N/13C-labeled monomers. Exchangeable amide protons were identified by the CLEANEX-PM experiment with a mixing time of 100 ms (49Hwang T.L. van Zijl P.C. Mori S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). HNOE values were measured by a standard pulse sequence (reviewed in Ref. 50Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W. Palmer A. Skeleton N. Protein NMR Spectroscopy Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). The HNOE values for each residue were calculated as the intensity ratio (I/I0)ofthe 15N-1H correlation peak in the presence (I) and absence (I0) of proton saturation during the relaxation delay of 5 s. Spectral processing and analysis was performed using the program NMRPipe (44Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—NOEs were manually assigned and classified as: strong (1.8-2.7 or 1.8-2.9 Å for the NOE of NH), medium (1.8-3.3 or 1.8-3.5 Å for NOE of NH), weak (1.8-5.0 Å), or very weak (1.8-6.0 Å). For distances involving methyl protons, 0.5 Å was added to the upper limit to account for the higher apparent intensity of methyl protons. ψ and φ torsion angle restraints were derived from 3JHNA (51Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 79-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and a data base analysis of chemical shifts (N, HN,Cα,Cβ,C′,Hα) using the program TALOS (52Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Minimum error ranges for ψ and φ were set to ± 40 and ±20, respectively. H-bonds, which were identified by the 13C backbone chemical shifts, short range NOE patterns, and nonex-changeable protons, were incorporated for the helical region, residues 17-48, as two restraints per H-bond where rNH-O = 1.5-2.8 Å and rN-O = 2.4-3.5 Å. The structures were calculated by simulated annealing in torsion angle space (53Stein E.G. Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 124: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) starting from three extended strands, followed by conventional simulated annealing (54Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), using the program CNS (55Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

The program was adapted to incorporate a conformational data base (56Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and a pseudopotential term for noncrystallographic symmetry (17Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T.

Acta. 2001; 1536: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A family of the 30 lowest energy structures was chosen, and a minimized mean structure was calculated. The overall quality of the final structures was assessed using the program PRO-CHECK (58Laskowski R.A. MacArther M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The figures were generated using the program MOL-MOL (59Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). Optimization of Experimental Conditions—Previous analytical ultracentrifugation studies have demonstrated that SARS CoV S2-HR2 is a trimer (40Tripet B. Howard M.W. Jobling M. Holmes R.K. Holmes K.V. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20836-20849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Accordingly, our initial NMR experiments on S2-HR2 were performed under varying conditions of pH and salt to optimize the solubility of the construct. However, at protein concentrations greater than 400 μm, which are typically necessary for NMR structural studies, S2-HR2 tends to form higher molecular mass species (larger than that of a trimer, 18 kDa) as evidenced by the presence of additional broad peaks in the 15N-edited HSQC (data not shown). The additional broad peaks of the higher molecular mass species are only observed at relatively high concentrations and therefore believed to be nonphysiologically relevant. The co-solvent TFE has previously been used to break up aggregates formed between coiled coil complexes without breaking up the true coiled coil quaternary structure (60Lindhout D.A. Litowski J.R. Mercier P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biopolymers. 2004; 75: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). By the addition of 30% TFE, we were able to obtain NMR spectra with one set of resonance peaks at a concentration of 1 mm, which was suitable for high resolution structural studies. Resonance Assignment and Secondary Structure—A two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectrum of S2-HR2 (buffer conditions 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 30% TFE-d3, 10% 2H2O) is shown in Fig. 1. The backbone assignments were obtained using the standard set of three-dimensional triple resonance experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures” (the resonance assignments have been deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Databank under entry 6969). The 15N-1H assignments are shown in Fig. 1. The 13C′ and 13Cα chemical shifts with respect to random coil values are shown in Fig. 2a. The secondary chemical shift suggests the presence of helix from residues 17 to 51. As shown by Fig. 2b, the HNOE profile further supports the presence of the helical region encompassing this region. For example, residues 3-16 and 52-55 clearly exhibit higher mobility with respect to the central region. The presence of exchangeable amide protons was next probed by CLEANEX-PM experiments (49Hwang T.L. van Zijl P.C. Mori S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the amides of residues 7-13, 49, and 51-55 are in relatively fast exchange with solvent. Based on the 13C chemical shifts, HNOE, and amide exchange experiment, as well as the short range NOE patterns, S2-HR2 consists of a continuous helix from residues Asn17 to Leu47.FIGURE 2Secondary structure of SARS-CoV S2-HR2. a, secondary chemical shift of S2-HR2 13Cα (gray) and 13C′ (white) with respect to random coil values.

The sample conditions were 1 mm of S2-HR2 monomer, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 30% TFE-d3 at 25 °C with a mixing time of 100 ms. Note that residues Thr4 and Ser5, which occur in an unstructured region at the N terminus, exhibit negative contours, presumably because of ROE effects and/or intermolecular NOEs with H2O (49Hwang T.L. van Zijl P.C. Mori S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The absence of a correlations for residues 17-47 suggests that they are involved in H-bonds. The absence of correlations for residues 14-16 and 50 may suggest the presence of H-bonds. The other missing correlations include those of residues 1-3, which are also missing from the 15N-edited HSQC (residue 6 is a proline).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Structure Determination—The calculation of a symmetric trimer using NMR is a challenging task and requires the use of isotopic-filtered NOE experiments (reviewed in Ref. 61Otting G.

In the present work, intermolecular NOEs were identified by a three-dimensional F1-filtered F2-edited 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC (48Stuart A.C. Borzilleri K.A. Withka J.M. Palmer A.G. J. Am. Chem.

Based on previous analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, S2-HR2 is a trimer; hence one is not able to distinguish between intermolecular NOEs for example between subunit A and B or subunit A and C. We therefore assigned the NOEs in such a way that a proton on one subunit is allowed to interact with protons of the other subunits as (∑r-6)-1/6 sums (17Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Covell D.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4572-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Examples of the quality of the filtered NOE spectrum are shown for selected residues in Fig. 4. In total, all intermolecular NOEs were found between residues in the a, d, e, and g positions of the helical wheel, consistent with the interface of a trimeric coiled coil structure, to be discussed below. The solution structure of S2-HR2 was determined using information from a total of 344 NOEs (including 85 intermolecular NOEs), 30 H-bonds, 19 J-coupling constants, and 110 dihedral restraints/subunit (Table 1). The structure statistics of the family of the 30 lowest energy structures and the final minimized mean structure are summarized in Table 1. The superposition of the backbone of the final 30 lowest energy simulated annealing structures is shown in Fig. 5a. The final ensemble shows no NOE violations over 0.5 Å and no dihedral angles in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). The root mean square deviation of residues Asn17-Leu47, which comprise the helical regions, relative to the mean is 0.46 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.04 Å for the heavy atoms.TABLE 1Structural statistics<SA><SA>rRoot mean square deviation from distance restraintsTotal (344)0.014 ± 0.00200.012Intraresidue (57)0.004 ± 0.0030.003Sequential (|i-j|=1) (153)0.010 ± 0.0030.008Short range (1<(|i-j|<5)) (49)0.014 ± 0.0030.014Intermolecular (85)0.024 ± 0.0040.019Root mean square deviations from dihedral restraints (deg) (110)aTorsion angle restraints consisted of 51 φ, 51 ψ, 4 χ1, and 4 χ2 per subunit.0.19 ± 0.140.16Root mean square deviations from JHNα coupling (Hz) (19)0.449 ± 0.090.539Deviations from Idealized Covalent GeometryBonds (Å)0.0018 ± 0.000160.0016Angels (deg)0.389 ± 0.0220.360Improper torsion (deg)0.339 ± 0.0260.317Measures of Structure QualitybOverall quality of the structure as determined by the program PROCHECK (58).Residues in most favorable region (%)88.1 ± 3.289.8Residues in additionally allowed region (%)11.5 ± 3.58.2Residues in generously allowed region (%)0.4 ± 0.82.0Residues in disallowed region (%)0.0 ± 0.00.0Number of bad contacts/100 residues4.8 ± 3.36.0Coordinates precision (Å)cDefined as average root mean square difference between the ensemble structures and the mean structure.Backbone residues 17-470.46 ± 0.17Heavy residues 17-471.04 ± 0.15a Torsion angle restraints consisted of 51 φ, 51 ψ, 4 χ1, and 4 χ2 per subunit.b Overall quality of the structure as determined by the program PROCHECK (58Laskowski R.A.

In this representation, subunits A, B, and C are colored red, green, and blue, respectively. S2-HR2 forms a symmetric trimeric coiled coil with an overall length of ∼96 Å and width of ∼13 Å. There are extensive contacts between the three subunits with ∼6150 Å2 buried upon complex formation. Interestingly, the side chains of the two conserved glycosylation sites of HR2, Asn17 and Asn38, are exposed to the surface as expected. A surface electrostatic representation of S2-HR2 shown in Fig. 5c reveals that the charge is evenly distributed along the entire helix. The main interface of the S2-HR2 coiled coil trimer was determined to include residues Asn17-Leu47. A coiled coil structure is a bundle of α-helices that interact with each other in such a way that they will form a left-handed superhelix. Residues in the a and d positions are often hydrophobic residues that will interact with each other to form the hydrophobic core. This packing is often referred to as knobs-into-holes and is the hallmark for a true coiled coil structure (62Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar, 63Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The packing of the amino acid side chains within S2-HR2 coiled coil is shown in Fig. 6. The hydrophobic residues in the a position (Val20, Ile27, Ala34, and Leu41) are colored purple, and those in the d position (Ile23, Leu30, Leu37, and Leu44) are colored green to show the relative orientation and positioning. The stacking of these residues is arranged in a way that creates a tightly packed core within the S2-HR2 trimer with the hydrophobic interface buried. Positions e and g within a heptad repeat usually contain charged amino acids placed in such a way that the charges are complementary to each other to allow electrostatic interaction. In the case of S2-HR2, there is only one charged amino acid, in position g (Glu26), and therefore it is not likely that the e and g positions play important roles in the stability of the S2-HR2 trimer. On the other hand, positions b, c, and f are surface exposed in the coiled coil structure and generally encompass polar amino acids that contribute to the solubility of the protein. In the coiled coil region of S2-HR2, we note that there are two surface exposed hydrophobic residues, Val21 and Ile42, that are conserved among coronaviruses. Interestingly, in the fusion structure (25Supekar V.M. Bruckmann C. Ingallinella P. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Carfi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17958-17963Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), post-Val and Ile form contacts with the HR1 that presumably stabilize the six-helix bundle conformation. Conclusions—In conclusion SARS-CoV S2-HR2 forms a coiled coil structure in solution consisting of three helices coming together to form a parallel trimer. As mentioned in the introduction, SARS-CoV S2 is thought to exist in two conformations: a prefusion conformation in which HR1 and HR2 do not interact with each other and a fusion conformation in which HR2 interacts with the trimeric coiled coil of HR1 in an antiparallel fashion to form the six-helix bundle, which was also observed for HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) gp41 and Ebola glycoprotein. In light of our results, it is enticing to speculate that the present structure represents a prefusion intermediate of the S2-HR2 region, which has never before been observed for coroniviridae. Importantly, the information provided in this study may be exploited for the design of novel antivirals. For example, the relatively poor antiviral activity of SARS-CoV S2-HR2 may be a consequence of its tendency to form the trimeric coiled coil, and thus one potential strategy would be to mutate residues that are important to the formation of a HR2 trimer while at the same time maintaining the interactions necessary for the HR2-HR1 interaction. We thank the members of the Brian Volkman laboratory (Uninversity of Wisconsin Medical College) for help with the intermolecular NOE experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2045109604,"The extracellular loops of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) frequently contain binding sites for peptide ligands. However, the mechanism of receptor activation following ligand binding and the influence of the extracellular loops in other aspects of receptor function are poorly understood. Here we report a structure-function analysis of the first and third extracellular loops of the human C5a receptor, a GPCR that binds a 74-amino acid peptide ligand. Amino acid substitutions were randomly incorporated into each loop, and functional receptors were identified in yeast. The first extracellular loop contains a large number of positions that cannot tolerate amino acid substitutions, especially residues within the W<i>X</i>FG motif found in many rhodopsin-like GPCRs, yet disruption of these residues does not alter C5a binding affinity. These results demonstrate an unanticipated role for the first extracellular loop, and the W<i>X</i>FG motif in particular, in ligand-mediated activation of the C5a receptor. This motif likely serves a similar role in other GPCRs. The third extracellular loop, in contrast, contains far fewer preserved residues and appears to play a less essential role in receptor activation."

Calculation of rate constants for membrane trafficking of wild-type and mutant Tac-MUC1 indicated that the lack of palmitoylation blocked recycling, but not endocytosis, and caused the chimera to accumulate in a EGFP-Rab11-positive endosomal compartment. Mutations CQC/AQA and Y20N inhibited Tac-MUC1 co-immunoprecipitation with AP-1, although mutant Y20N had reduced rates of both endocytosis and recycling, but a normal subcellular distribution.

The anti-adhesive property of MUC1 is also enhanced by its ability to compete with the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin for binding of cytoplasmic β-catenin, an important link in the maintenance of actin interactions with the adherins junctions of epithelia (14Yamamoto M.

The mechanism for nuclear or mitochondrial targeting of the MUC1 small subunit is unknown, but delivery of the subunit to any intracellular compartment is likely dependent on its endocytosis from the cell surface. We have reported previously that MUC1 is internalized faster with shorter glycans (32Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol.

Replacement of the extended ectodomain of MUC1 with that of Tac (interleukin-2 receptor α-subunit) also enhances endocytosis; and using site-specific mutagenesis, we identified two new interactions of the MUC1 tail that are required for its efficient endocytosis (37Kinlough C.L.

Mutation Y20N (numbered from the membrane; see sequence in Fig. 1A) inhibits both AP-2 (adaptor protein complex 2) binding and endocytosis, whereas mutation Y60N inhibits Grb2 binding and endocytosis; maximal inhibition of endocytosis was observed when both Tyr20 and Tyr60 were mutated, indicating that both adaptors are needed for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of MUC1 (37Kinlough C.L.

Previous reports indicated that mutation of the sequence CQC to AQA at the boundary of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (see Fig. 1) blocks surface expression of MUC1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 3The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; NHS-SS-Biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate; MESNA, 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid sodium salt; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DRMs, detergent-resistant membranes. 3The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; NHS-SS-Biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate; MESNA, 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid sodium salt; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DRMs, detergent-resistant membranes. cells (38Pemberton L.F.

Baruch A. Elroy-Stein O. Keydar I. Wreschner D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), consistent with a functional role(s) for this motif. The context of CQC3, between the transmembrane domain and a cluster of basic residues (RRK6), fits the minimal consensus for protein S-palmitoylation (40Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 32-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 41Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J.

Inhibition of transmembrane protein S-palmitoylation by mutation of target Cys residues has revealed multiple roles for this post-translational modification in regulating homotypic and heterotypic protein-protein interactions, association with lipid microdomains, protein maturation, and membrane trafficking. Therefore, experiments were carried out to determine whether MUC1 is S-palmitoylated and, if so, how this affects MUC1 expression and membrane trafficking. The results of our studies indicate that MUC1 exhibits dual palmitoylation of the CQC3 motif and that blocking palmitoylation by mutation of CQC to AQA inhibits recycling, whereas endocytosis is unaffected. It is interesting that mutations that block palmitoylation also decrease Tac-MUC1 association with AP-1 (adaptor protein complex 1) and cause chimera accumulation in recycling endosomes. Mutation Y20N also inhibits association with AP-1 and blocks both endocytosis and recycling, but this mutant chimera maintains a normal subcellular distribution, indicating that recycling of MUC1 is predominantly regulated by its palmitoylation. Cell Lines and Recombinant cDNAs—The generation of clonal Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing human MUC1 with 22 tandem repeats was described previously (32Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L.

MUC1 with 22 tandem repeats was also subcloned into pcDNA3-neo (Invitrogen) for transient expression of MUC1 or MUC1 mutants in CHO cells by infection with recombinant vaccinia virus (vT7CP) and transfection with plasmids using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (44Hughey R.P.

Briefly, cells were infected with vT7CP for 30 min, followed by transfection for 2.5 h before metabolic labeling as described below. The Tac-MUC1 chimera was prepared by replacing the MUC1 ectodomain with the Tac ectodomain as described previously (37Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Harkleroad K.L. Hughey R.P. J. Biol.

The Cys residue in the MUC1 transmembrane domain (mutant TM-C) or one or both Cys residues in the CQC3RRK sequence at the junction of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (mutants CQC/AQC, CQC/CQA, and CQC/AQA) were changed to Ala, or RRK was changed to QQQ (mutant RRK/QQQ) by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. A Y20N mutation was also introduced into Tac-MUC1 mutant CQC/AQA (mutant AQA+Y20N). Clonal lines of CHO cells stably transfected with either the Tac-MUC1 chimera or Tac-MUC1 mutants (all in pcDNA3-neo) were selected by growth in G418 (0.5 mg/ml) as described previously (37Kinlough C.L.

All cloned cDNAs were sequenced prior to use. Metabolic Labeling with [3H]Palmitate—CHO cells (35-mm wells) transiently transfected with wild-type MUC1 or Cys mutants were cultured overnight in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) with 1% fetal bovine serum and either 167 mCi of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (36.3 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 50 mCi of [35S]Met/Cys (1000 Ci/mmol; EasyTag EXPRE35S35S Protein Labeling Mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

The beads were then washed twice with 1 ml of HBS containing 0.01% SDS, and the immunoprecipitates were released by heating for 2 min at 90 °C in 0.06 ml of HBS containing 1% SDS. After centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was recovered: 10% was retained as “total immunoprecipitate,” and 90% was diluted with 0.75 ml of HBS before recovery of biotinylated protein with ImmunoPure immobilized avidin (Pierce) by end-over-end rotation overnight at 4 °C. After washing once with 1 ml of HBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and once with 1 ml of HBS, protein was eluted from the avidin-conjugated beads by heating for 3.5 min at 90 °C in 0.05 ml of SDS sample buffer containing 0.14 m β-mercaptoethanol.

For analysis of both subunits of MUC1, the nitrocellulose was cut horizontally at the 66-kDa molecular mass marker (Amersham Biosciences); the top was immunoblotted with mouse monoclonal antibody B27.29 (Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc., Malvern, PA), which recognizes the immunodominant epitope in the tandem repeat of the MUC1 large subunit from MDCK cells (220,000 Da), and the bottom was immunoblotted with Armenian hamster monoclonal antibody CT2 for the small subunit (25-30 kDa) (22Schroeder J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2000647523,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells like transcript-1 (TLT-1) is an abundant platelet-specific, type I transmembrane receptor. The extracellular fragment of TLT-1 consists of a single, immunoglobulin-like domain connected to the platelet cell membrane by a linker region called the stalk. Here we present evidence that a soluble fragment of the TLT-1 extracellular domain is found in serum of humans and mice and that an isoform of similar mass is released from platelets following activation with thrombin. We also report the crystal structure of the immunoglobulin domain of TLT-1 determined at the resolution of 1.19 Å. The structure of TLT-1 is similar to other immunoglobulin-like variable domains, particularly those of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1), the natural killer cell-activating receptor NKp44, and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. Particularly interesting is a 17-amino acid segment of TLT-1, homologous to a fragment of murine TREM-1, which, in turn, showed activity in blocking the TREM-1-mediated inflammatory responses in mice. Structural similarity to TREM-1 and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, and evidence for a naturally occurring soluble fragment of the TLT-1 extracellular domain, suggest that this immunoglobulin-like domain autonomously plays an as yet unidentified, functional role.

Schubert R.L. Quigley L. Disipio T. Feltz R. Cho E.H. McVicar D.W. Blood. 2004; 104: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The gene that codes for TLT-1 is located in the TREM gene cluster on human chromosome 6, locus 6p21.1, and murine chromosome 17. Related genes in the human TREM gene cluster include TREMs 1 and 2, TLTs 1 through 5, and the natural killer cell-activating receptor NKp44 (2Allcock R.J. Barrow A.D. Forbes S. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the murine genome, chromosome 17 includes genes encoding TREMs 1 through 5, and TLTs 1 and 2 (2Allcock R.J. Barrow A.D. Forbes S. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Gene products from the TREM gene cluster are expressed in specific populations of cells of the myeloid lineage. To date, only TREM-1, TREM-2, NKp44, and TLT-1 have been characterized. The immunoglobulin-like domain of human TLT-1 (hTLT-1) consists of 105 residues and is attached to the membrane by a 37-amino acid stalk. The putative transmembrane segment of hTLT-1 is 20 amino acids long and lacks the positively charged amino acid that other TREM family members use to interact with a negatively charged side chain of the adaptor molecule DAP12 (3Colonna M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Inside the membrane-spanning region, DNAX activation protein 12 contains a signaling motif known as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (3Colonna M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Two cDNA sequences, which code for proteins with identical extracellular and membrane-spanning regions but different cytoplasmic domains (2Allcock R.J. Barrow A.D. Forbes S. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), have been reported for hTLT-1. The shorter transcript has a cytoplasmic domain of 18 amino acids with no recognizable signaling motifs, and the cytoplasmic domain of the longer hTLT-1 transcript consists of 127 amino acids, including two tyrosine residues. Both cytoplasmic tyrosines are found in sequence motifs known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (4Washington A.V. Quigley L. McVicar D.W. Blood. 2002; 100: 3822-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TLT-1, carrying two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, is the only product of the TREM gene cluster with known signaling motifs. Crystal structures of the previously determined immunoglobulin-like domains from several TREM family receptors include NKp44 (PDB code 1HKF) (5Cantoni C. Ponassi M. Biassoni R. Conte R.

Biol. 2004; 342: 1237-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, TREM-1 and TREM-2 gained attention because of their potential involvement in human diseases. The presence of soluble TREM-1 in human serum has been shown to be a specific marker of bacterial infection (9Gibot S. Cravoisy A. Clin. Med. Res. 2004; 2: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and TREM-1 expression patterns appear to correlate with survival of patients with sepsis (10Gibot S. Le Renard P.E. Bollaert P.E. Kolopp-Sarda M.N. Bene M.C. Faure G.C. Levy B. Intensive Care Med. 2005; 31: 594-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mutations of TREM-2 cause a rare genetic disorder in humans called Nasu-Hakola disease (11Cella M. Buonsanti C. Strader C. Kondo T. Salmaggi A. Colonna M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Studies using a murine model of septic shock have demonstrated an interesting paradigm for TREM-1 function: Expression of surface-bound TREM-1 is up-regulated in response to bacterial infection, resulting in increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leading to an immune response against the potential pathogen. However, overreaction of the immune system can cause septic shock. A recent study showed that administration of either the intact immunoglobulin-like domain of murine TREM-1 or a specific 17-amino acid peptide fragment of mTREM-1 resulted in decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and protected mice from death caused by septic shock (12Gibot S. Kolopp-Sarda M.N. Bene M.C. Bollaert P.E. Lozniewski A. Mory F. Levy B. Faure G.C. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus, the mTREM-1 immunoglobulin-like domain apparently blocks the signal produced by surface-bound mTREM-1 (12Gibot S. Kolopp-Sarda M.N. Bene M.C. Bollaert P.E. Lozniewski A. Mory F. Levy B. Faure G.C. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). While examining the expression patterns of murine TLT-1 (mTLT-1) during platelet activation, we observed the time-dependent production of a smaller form of mTLT-1. Here, we present evidence that soluble species of TLT-1 can be found in murine and human serum. To build a strong foundation for future characterization of TLT-1 function, we crystallized a recombinant fragment of the hTLT-1 immunoglobulin-like domain consisting of residues 20-125, and determined its crystal structure at the resolution of 1.19 Å. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained and transfected as described earlier (13Paul S.P. Taylor L.S. Stansbury E.K. McVicar D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 483-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for mTLT-1 and characterization of full-length murine TLT-1 (mTLT-1) were previously described (13Paul S.P. Taylor L.S. Stansbury E.K. McVicar D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 483-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for mTLT-1 was tagged at the carboxyl terminus with a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fragment using PCR. Primers used for amplification included: forward, gtttaaacatgtgatggtgagcaagggcgaggag, and reverse, cggcacatgtggcagtcgtccatgccgagagtg. The PCR product was digested with PmeI and PvuII and blunt-end-ligated into an EcoRV site in the vector tag site to create mTLT-1YFP. hTLT-1 was generated by RT-PCR using Platinum HiFi-Supermix (Invitrogen) with human platelet cDNA as a template. Primers included: forward, atgggcctcaccctgctcttg, and reverse, gctggatggagtctgattg. Murine Platelets—Mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at NCI, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Frederick, MD. Animal care was provided following the procedures outlined in A Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (14National Research CouncilGuide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.National Institutes of Health Publication 86-23. NIH, Bethesda, MD1996Google Scholar). Peripheral blood collection via cardiac puncture and platelet purification from peripheral blood were performed as described earlier (15Jantzen H.M. Milstone D.S. Gousset L. Conley P.B. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Platelets were then washed in modified mouse Tyrode's buffer (10 mm HEPES, 138 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 2.9 mm KCl, and 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4). Human Platelets—Fresh platelet concentrate in acid-citrate-dextrose was obtained from the NIH blood bank. Platelets were isolated by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min and resuspended in Tyrode's solution (2 mm MgCl2, 137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 3 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1% glucose, 5 mm HEPES, and 0.35% albumin, pH 7.35) to a final concentration of 109 cells/ml. Washed platelets (108 cells) were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) and kept for 15 min on ice. Thereafter, 30 μg of protein per lane was examined by Western blot analysis as previously described (13Paul S.P. Taylor L.S. Stansbury E.K. McVicar D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 483-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antimurine TLT-1 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a fusion protein containing residues 21-167 of mTLT-1 and a polyhistidine tag for purification (Fusion Antibodies, Belfast, Northern Ireland). An additional antimurine TLT-1 polyclonal antibody, termed mTLT1-c, as well as antihuman TLT-1, were generated by immunizing goats, and purified by affinity chromatography (R&D Systems, Minneapolis). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and controls were obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The cDNA sequence encoding full-length hTLT-1 was obtained from GenBank™ (BC100945) (16Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Wheeler D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D34-D38Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The expression construct used for structure determination contains only the immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 20-125). This fragment (20-125) was chosen for structural studies based on alignment of the sequence of TLT-1 with the sequence used for structure determination of NKp44 (1HKF), and predicted secondary structure of hTLT-1 from the Jufo server (5Cantoni C.

Modeling. 2001; 7: 360-369Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence was optimized for expression in Escherichia coli using the program DNAWorks (18Hoover D.M. Lubkowski J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The gene assembly and amplification were performed as previously described (18Hoover D.M. Lubkowski J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and then the synthetic gene was cloned into a pET-22b plasmid vector for expression in E. coli. A pET-22b vector (Novagen) containing the gene encoding residues 20-125 of hTLT-1 was transformed into the E. coli BL21DE3-RIL-competent cells (Invitrogen). Transformed cells were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB):agar plates supplemented with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml of ampicillin. Individual colonies were isolated and used to inoculate 50-ml cultures of LB with chloramphenicol and ampicillin, and incubated for 12-16 h at 37 °C. The overnight cultures were resuspended in 950 ml of LB (with chloramphenicol and ampicillin) and incubated at 37 °C until optical densities showed logarithmic growth. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 1% glucose (m/v). After incubation with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3-5 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, with lysozyme (1 mg/ml), deoxyribonuclease I (1 mg/ml), and ribonuclease A (1 mg/ml). After mechanical cell lysis and centrifugation (28,000 × g for 40 min), the soluble lysate was discarded. The insoluble material containing TLT-1 was washed several times, and solubilized in 8 m urea as previously described (19Zhou G. Parthasarathy G. Somasundaram T. Ables A. Roy L. Strong S.J. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After centrifugation and filtering, the resulting solution was diluted with 50 mm Tris (pH 8) containing arginine (400 mm), reduced glutathione (5 mm), and oxidized glutathione (0.5 mm) to a final protein concentration between 0.1 and 0.01 mg/ml, and final urea concentration of 50-100 mm. After stirring for 4 days at 4 °C, the refolded and oxidized solution of hTLT-1 was concentrated (Amicon ultrafiltration cell, Millipore) and subjected to size-exclusion and ion-exchange chromatographies (Sephacryl S100 HR and DEAE-Sepharose, GE Biosciences). Purity and identity of the protein were established by SDS-PAGE, and by electrospray mass spectrometry, ESI-MS (Agilent Technologies, Hewlett-Packard). The purified hTLT-1 sample was digested with trypsin and analyzed by ESI-MS to establish the connectivity of disulfide bonds. Sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Roche Diagnostics Gmbh, Mannheim, Germany) was dissolved in 1 mm HCl to a concentration of 1 mg/ml and mixed in a mass-ratio of 1:50 with a 1 mg/ml solution of hTLT-1 in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5. After overnight digestion at room temperature, samples were analyzed by ESI-MS. Preparations of hTLT-1 immunoglobulin-like domain were subjected to crystallization trials by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Clusters of thin crystal plates initially appeared in the droplets containing 5-10 mg/ml hTLT-1, 0.8 m sodium/potassium phosphate (pH 5.6). Subsequent optimization resulted in thicker crystals. The final crystallization medium contained 1 μl each of 10 mg/ml hTLT-1 in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and mother liquor consisting of 15-19% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, and 0.5 m sodium/potassium phosphate (pH 5.6). All crystallization experiments were completed at 15 °C. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK) after brief soaking of crystals in a mother liquor, supplemented with 30% (v/v) glycerol. A complete set of diffraction intensities extending to the resolution of 1.7 Å was collected using X-radiation generated by rotating anode (λ = 1.542 Å) mounted on the Rigaku Ru200 x-ray generator (Rigaku/MSC) operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. Intensities were recorded using a Mar345 image plate detector (Mar Research). The high resolution data set (30-1.19 Å) was collected at the SER-CAT beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, USA) with x-ray wavelength tuned to 1.135 Å. The diffraction images were recorded using the 2 × 2 mosaic charge-coupled device detector (Mar Research). All data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (HKL Research) (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar).

Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; D57: 1373-1382Crossref Scopus (771) Google Scholar), and the experimental data were collected on a conventional x-ray source. The assembly of superimposed models of hTREM-1 (PDB: 1SMO chain A) (6Kelker M.S. Debler E.W. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), NKp44 (PDB: 1HKF) (5Cantoni C. Ponassi M. Biassoni R. Conte R. Spallarossa A. Moretta A. Moretta L. Bolognesi M. Bordo D.

After successful identification of the solution, hTREM-1 atoms from the search assembly were used as the initial model of the hTLT-1 structure. Through an iterative process of manual and automated structural refinement, the amino acid sequence was converted to that of hTLT-1 using the programs O (23Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1996; A47: 110-119Google Scholar) and CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). This process was repeated until all residues were incorporated into the model. The resolution of x-ray data was gradually extended to 1.6 Å. At this stage, all well defined water molecules were included in the model, and the resolution of the experimental data was extended to the available limit of 1.19 Å. Subsequent structural refinement was carried out with the program Refmac (25Murshudav G. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). Additional water molecules were identified automatically with the program ARP/wARP (26Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands2001: 720-722Google Scholar). During the final stages of refinement, isotropic B factors were replaced with anisotropic terms. Values of crystallographic R factor and free R for the final model were 0.165 and 0.195, respectively. The model's geometric and stereochemical properties were monitored by the programs Procheck (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WhatCheck (28Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). Table 1 shows detailed refinement statistics. The final coordinates and the experimental structure factors have been deposited with the protein data bank (PDB code: 2FRG). Soluble Fragment of TLT-1—TLT-1, found in the α-granules of resting platelets, is translocated to the platelet surface following activation by thrombin (1Washington A.V. Schubert R.L. Quigley L. Disipio T. Feltz R. Cho E.H. McVicar D.W. Blood. 2004; 104: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A time-course experiment was performed using resting and activated mouse platelets to characterize activation-dependent changes in mTLT-1 expression. Following activation, platelet suspensions were combined with an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer. The equivalent of 1.5 × 107 platelets was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. During the 5-h period, the apparent mass of mTLT-1 shifted from almost exclusively a 40-kDa form to a nearly equal mixture of 40- and 25-kDa forms (Fig. 1A). This observation led us to test whether the smaller mTLT-1 isoform was released from platelets. In subsequent experiments, platelets were centrifuged prior to lysis to separate the cell-associated and -soluble fractions. Pelleted resting platelets and the resulting supernatant showed no trace of a 25-kDa isoform (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). However, following activation with thrombin, a soluble form of mTLT-1 could be detected in the supernatant after removal of platelets by centrifugation (Fig. 1B, lane 4). The 25-kDa form of mTLT-1 was detected in murine serum when probed with an antibody specific for the extracellular domain of mTLT-1 but not detected in serum using an antibody specific to the cytoplasmic domain of mTLT-1, suggesting that the species in serum includes the extracellular domain (Fig. 1C). We confirmed the identity of the 25-kDa band as TLT-1 by showing that two different antibodies directed toward the extracellular domain of mTLT-1 reacted with it, whereas a series of control antibodies did not (Fig. 1D). TLT-1 was not observed in murine plasma or in defibrinated plasma (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3). To test whether mTLT-1 found in serum resulted from proteolytic cleavage of the platelet surface-associated variant, or from alternative transcription of soluble isoforms, we transfected HEK293 cells with cDNA encoding mTLT-1, or a mTLT1/YFP chimera (Fig. 1E). Similar results were obtained for both forms of recombinant mTLT-1 in that the protein is observed near the expected molecular masses in cell-associated fractions (lanes 1 and 3), and isoforms of identical size were detected in conditioned cell media, irrespective of the cDNA construct used for transfection (lanes 2 and 4). The isoform released from HEK293 cells was identical in apparent molecular mass to the form detected in murine serum (lane 5). Although there is >70% homology between the murine and human orthologs, we repeated the experiments using human platelets, serum, and HEK293 cells transfected with hTLT-1 cDNA. Human platelets and serum probed with an antibody specific for the extracellular domain of hTLT-1 demonstrate similarities to the murine system (Fig. 2, A and B). Activated human platelets show various hTLT-1 isoforms, but human serum contains only a pair of smaller forms (Fig. 2A). In human serum, two bands corresponding to apparent masses of 12 and 14 kDa were observed (Fig. 2A), very similar to the doublet observed in supernatant following platelet activation (Fig. 2B). Human TLT-1 is absent from supernatants of resting platelets and from plasma (Fig. 2B). To test whether hTLT-1 fragments were in fact derived from cleavage of hTLT-1, or from alternative transcription, we transfected HEK293 cells with the hTLT-1 cDNA encoding the smaller of two known forms of hTLT-1 and evaluated the cell culture media for the presence of these fragments. No hTLT-1 was detected from wild-type HEK293 cells or conditioned culture media, but full-length (35 kDa) and smaller forms (12 and 14 kDa) are clearly observed in extracts from cells, which were transfected with the hTLT-1 gene (Fig. 2C). Lanes 4 and 5 of Fig. 2C show that the isoforms of recombinant hTLT-1 released from HEK293 cells (lane 4) are identical in apparent molecular mass to those released from platelets following activation with thrombin (lane 5). Taken together, experiments examining TLT-1 from platelets and recombinant TLT-1 from HEK293 cells, suggest that the extracellular domain may have a function independent of the intact molecule. To gain a deeper understanding of how this domain may function, we have crystallized and determined the structure of the immunoglobulin-like domain of human TLT-1. The Overall Structure of hTLT-1—Human TLT-1 crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions a = 46.9 Å, b = 80.1 Å, and c = 25.7 Å. The final model described unique conformations of all the side chains, including those in the loop regions. Figs. 3 (A and B) show the overall structure of hTLT-1 consisting of nine β-strands connected by loops in the V-type immunoglobulin-like fold. The loop connecting strands B and C (B-C loop), and the E-F loop form short 310 helical segments, similar to those observed in TREM-1 (Fig. 3C). The overall structure of the immunoglobulin-like domain of hTLT-1 is very similar to antibody variable domains with the largest differences observed in CDR loop regions (Fig. 3D). hTLT-1 has two disulfide bonds, homologous to those seen previously in the structures of NKp44 and pIgR. Formation of the disulfide bonds was closely monitored during the purification of hTLT-1 by trypsin digestion and subsequent ESI-MS. One of the disulfide bonds (Cys38-Cys104) in TLT-1 is relatively conserved in immunoglobulin-like domains, and it is found in murine and human TREM-1, NKp44, and pIgR. The second disulfide bond in hTLT-1, connecting Cys52 located in strand βC and Cys59 (strand βC′), is not present in murine or human TREM-1 but is found in NKp44 and pIgR. Comparison with Known Structures—The model of hTLT-1 immunoglobulin-like domain was used as a probe for searching the protein data bank (PDB) using the Vector Search Alignment Tool from NCBI (29Gibrat J.F. Madej T. Bryant S.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The search identified 53 non-redundant protein structures with significant structural similarity to hTLT-1. The closest structural relatives to hTLT-1 are cell-surface receptors, including pIgR, TREM-1, NKp44, and the mouse myeloid cell receptor, Clm-1 (PDB code: 1ZOX). The immunoglobulin-like domain of hTLT-1 also shares significant structural homology with T-cell receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and other immune receptors. The root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the structurally equivalent Cα atoms in hTLT-1 and a T-cell receptor, Vα11 (PDB code: 1H5B chain A) is 1.7 Å, whereas the value calculated for the human junctional adhesion molecule type I (PDB code: 1NBQ) and hTLT-1 is 1.6 Å. For comparison, the r.m.s.d. values calculated for hTLT-1 and proteins with higher amino acid sequence homology, mTREM-1, hTREM-1, NKp44, and pIgR, are 1.1, 1.1, 2.1, and 1.4 Å, respectively. CDR-equivalent Loops—Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) have been identified in antibody V-domains as portions as antigen binding regions (30Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol.

The enzyme responsible for the initial step in the synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate is UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal-enzyme-N-acetylglucosmine-1-phosphotransferase(GlcNAc-phosphotransferase). GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is a multisubunit enzyme with an α2β2γ2 arrangement that requires a detergent for solubilization. Recent cloning of cDNAs and genes encoding these subunits revealed that the α- and β-subunits are encoded by a single gene as a precursor, whereas the γ-subunit is encoded by a second gene. The hydropathy plots of the deduced amino acid sequences suggested that the α- and β-subunits but not the γ-subunit contain transmembrane domains. Access to these cDNAs allowed us to express a soluble form of human recombinant GlcNAc-phosphotransferase by removing the putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains from the α- and β-subunits. Because this modification prevented precursor processing to mature α- and β-subunits, the native cleavage sequence was replaced by a cleavage site for furin. When the modified α/β-subunits (α′/β′-subunits) precursor and wild type γ-subunit cDNAs were co-expressed in 293T or CHO-K1 cells, a furin-like protease activity in these cells cleaved the precursor and produced an active and processed soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase with an α′2β′2γ2-subunits arrangement. Recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase exhibited specific activity and substrate preferences similar to the wild type bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase and was able to phosphorylate a lysosomal hydrolase, acid α-glucosidase in vitro.

Most lysosomal hydrolases are targeted to the lysosome via mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) 2The abbreviation used are: Man-6-P, mannose 6-phosphate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GAA, acid α-glucosidase; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal-enzyme-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase; ML, mucolipidosis; ML II, inclusion cell disease; ML IIIA, classical Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy disease; UCE, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. -modified N-glycans. The initial step of Man-6-P biosynthesis is catalyzed by the membrane-bound enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal-enzyme-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.8.17), which transfers GlcNAc 1-phosphate from UDP-GlcNAc to mannose in high mannose-type glycans (1Reitman M.L.

The second step is removal of GlcNAc by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester α-GlcNAcase (UCE) to expose mannose 6-phosphate (4Varki A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Previously, we reported that the bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase has an α2β2γ2-configuration (6Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We also found that GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is encoded by two genes; one encoding the α/β-subunits precursor (7Kudo M. Bao M. D'Souza A. Ying F. Pan H. Roe B.A. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36141-36149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Tiede S. Storch S. Lubke T. Henrissat B. Bargal R. Raas-Rothschild A. Braulke T. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the other, the γ-subunit (9Raas-Rothschild A. Cormier-Daire V. Bao M. Genin E. Salomon R. Brewer K. Zeigler M. Mandel H. Toth S. Roe B. Munnich A. Canfield W.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Characterization of the cDNAs revealed that the α- and β-subunits contain amino and carboxyl terminus transmembrane domains, respectively, whereas the γ-subunit does not. The mechanism responsible for the processing of the α/β-subunits precursor into the mature α- and β-subunits is not yet known, but likely to be the result of protease(s) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or cis-Golgi, where GlcNAc-phosphotransferase resides (24Pohlman R. Waheed A. Hasilik A. Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5323-5325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Access to the cDNAs for all three subunits of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase made it possible to express recombinant GlcNAc-phosphotransferase for further characterization and also to use GlcNAc-phosphotransferase for in vitro phosphorylation of proteins. Many types of cells express Man-6-P receptor on their surface, as well as in the trans-Golgi network. Therefore, glycoproteins containing Man-6-P can bind to the cell surface and then be targeted to the lysosome via cell-surface Man-6-P receptors. Generation of phosphorylated proteins might be useful for enzyme replacement therapy of lysosomal storage disease patients, who lack one or more lysosomal enzymes. The lysosomal enzyme could be modified with Man-6-P in vitro using GlcNAc-phosphotransferase and UCE. Production of recombinant GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, however, is limited because of its membrane-bound nature. Engineering of the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase to generate a secreted, soluble form will be helpful for the in vitro use of the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. In this paper, we describe the engineering, expression, and characterization of a recombinant soluble human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. To generate a soluble enzyme, the putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains in the α- and β-subunits were deleted, and a signal peptide sequence was attached at the amino terminus of the protein. It was found that the transmembrane domains are essential for efficient α/β-cleavage, and the cleavage is required for the optimal enzyme activity. Following molecular engineering of the α/β-cleavage site, a soluble recombinant GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was generated, which assembles with an α′2β′2γ2 structure (α′ and β′ stand for truncated α- and β-subunits, respectively) with a specific activity similar to purified bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (10Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31446-31451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The engineered soluble recombinant GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was able to transfer GlcNAc 1-phosphate to both small molecule and lysosomal hydrolase substrates. The recombinant GlcNAc-phosphotransferase thus generated has the potential use as a tool both for studying the mechanism of phosphorylation and for generation of phosphorylated molecules for enzyme replacement therapy. Expression Vector with a Signal Peptide and Epitope Tag—A double strand nucleotide sequence containing an NheI half-site, Kozak sequence (11Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar), mouse immunoglobulin κ chain signal peptide and cleavage site (METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTGD), HPC4 epitope (EDQVDPRLIDGK) (12Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 826-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a HindIII half-site was constructed by incubating synthetic oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide sequences that were used are available on request. The annealed double strand nucleotide was inserted between NheI and HindIII sites of pcDNA6/V5/His-A (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing. The resulting vector with signal peptide and epitope tag was cleaved with HindIII and XbaI to insert cDNA encoding partial GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α/β-subunits precursor sequences. Expression Plasmids for Soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α/β-Subunits Precursor, α-Subunit, and β-Subunit—Soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α/β-subunits precursor was generated by replacing the putative signal anchor/transmembrane domain at the amino terminus (amino acids 1-44) by a signal peptide and epitope tag and truncating the putative carboxyl terminus transmembrane domain (amino acids 1210-1256) in the wild type sequence (GenBank™ AY687932). The cDNA for the soluble precursor was generated by PCR and inserted between HindIII and XbaI site of the expression vector with a signal peptide and epitope tag. A cDNA for the soluble α-subunit was generated by the same method as the precursor except that the whole β-subunit was truncated. cDNA for the soluble β-subunit was generated by the same method except that the whole α-subunit and the first amino acid of the β-subunit (amino acid 929) were removed. The detailed methods for generation of these expression plasmids are available on request. Introduction of Protease Cleavage Sites at the Carboxyl Terminus of the α-Subunit—cDNAs encoding the precursor in which 4-6 amino acid at the carboxyl terminus of the α-subunit were changed to satisfy consensus protease cleavage sequences. The consensus sequences used are DDDDK for enterokinase (EC 3.4.21.9), IEGR for factor Xa protease (EC 3.4.21.6), RARYKR for furin (EC 3.4.21.75), and PGAAHY for Genease™ I (variant of subtilisin, EC 3.4.21.62). The detailed methods for generation of these expression plasmids are available on request. Bicistronic Expression Plasmid for Soluble α/β-Subunits Precursor and γ-Subunit—An expression plasmid encoding both the soluble α/β-subunits precursor with a furin cleavage site and the wild type γ-subunit was made using pEE6.1 and pEE14.1 (Lonza Biologics, Allendale, NJ). The cDNA for the soluble α/β-subunits precursor was subcloned into the XbaI site of pEE6.1, and the orientation was checked by sequencing. The γ-subunit cDNA was subcloned between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pEE14.1. Then both plasmids were cleaved with NotI and SalI. The NotI-SalI fragment containing the CMV promoter and the soluble α/β-subunits precursor cDNA was inserted between the NotI and SalI sites of the γ-subunit plasmid in pEE14.1. The resulting plasmid has a CMV promoter upstream of each cDNA. Transient Expression of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase in 293T Cells— 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in the atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were transfected with a plasmid or a mixture of plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Conditioned medium was harvested 72 h after transfection and analyzed for enzyme activity and protein expression by Western blotting using HPC4 antibody. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—CHO-K1 cells stably expressing recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase or GAA were developed using the glutamine synthetase gene expression system (Lonza Biologics). Briefly, CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the expression plasmids and selected in the presence of 25 μm l-methionine sulfoximine (Sigma). Following screening for enzyme activity to identify transfected cells, the inserted gene was further amplified by selection in 100-500 μm l-methionine sulfoximine. The clones with the highest protein expression level were chosen for protein production. Cell lines for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase and GAA were obtained by the selection with 500 and 100 μm l-methionine sulfoximine, respectively, and maintained with the presence of the same concentration of l-methionine sulfoximine. The CHO-K1 cells expressing GAA were further screened to obtain the cells lacking GlcNAc-transferase I activity using ricin (13Stanley P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 157-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ricin (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) was exhaustively dialyzed against potassium phosphate buffer. For selection, 107 cells in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were incubated in the presence of 1.3 mg of ricin for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were then plated into 96-well plates at the density of ∼5,000 cells/well. Ten colonies were formed after 3 weeks. The absence of GlcNAc-transferase I was confirmed by testing N-glycan structure on GAA by peptide-N-glycanase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) digestion. Cells lacking GlcNAc-transferase I produced GAA with only high mannose-type glycans that are released by endoglycosidase H, whereas wild type cells produced GAA with both complex and high mannose-type glycans, and some of the glycans are resistant to endoglycosidase H. Purification of Recombinant Soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase— CHO-K1 cell lines stably expressing recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase with HPC4 epitope were cultured in 1700 cm2 roller bottles in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. The conditioned medium was harvested every 3-4 days and subsequently clarified and concentrated ∼10-fold via a tangential flow filtration system equipped with a 30-kDa cut-off BioMax™ membrane (Millipore, Inc., Billerica, MA) and stored at -20 °C until purification. The GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was affinity-purified using a calcium-dependent HPC4-Sepharose column followed by anion-exchange chromatography. HPC4-Sepharose was prepared using NHS-activated-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The concentrated medium was loaded onto the HPC4-Sepharose column equilibrated with 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mm CaCl2, 15 mm MgCl2. Unbound materials were removed by washing first with the same buffer and then with 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 1 mm CaCl2, 15 mm MgCl2. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was eluted with 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA. The fractions containing GlcNAc-phosphotransferase were pooled and further purified on a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The pool was diluted six times with 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 15 mm MgCl2 and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column, followed by a wash with 20 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.5), 15 mm MgCl2. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was then eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.5), 15 mm MgCl2 and stored in aliquots at -80 °C until use. Purification of GAA with High Mannose-type Glycans—GAA with high mannose-type glycans were produced from CHO-K1 cells stably expressing GAA and lacking GlcNAc-transferase I activity. The cells were cultured in 1700 cm2 roller bottles in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2.5 μg/ml kifunensine (Industrial Research, Ltd., Wellington, New Zealand), 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 15% CO2, 85% air atmosphere. The increased CO2 concentration was to maintain the conditioned medium as slightly acidic to keep the GAA secreted in the culture medium active. Kifunensine is a mannosidase inhibitor that blocks Golgi mannosidase activity to maintain high mannose-type glycan on GAA. GAA-containing medium was clarified, concentrated 4-fold as described above, buffer-exchanged with 2 volumes of 20 mm BisTris, pH 5.5, and filtered again. The material was loaded onto DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mm BisTris, pH 5.5, followed by a wash with 20 mm BisTris, pH 5.5. GAA was eluted with 20 mm BisTris, pH 5.5, containing 150 NaCl. Ammonium sulfate was added to the eluate to 0.8 m and then applied to an Octyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.8 m ammonium sulfate buffer. Unbound materials were washed with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.8 m ammonium sulfate buffer and GAA was eluted with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5 buffer. The eluate was concentrated to final protein concentration of ∼10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration with a polyethersulfone filter with a 30-kDa molecular weight cut-off. The purified GAA was filtered through a 0.22-micron filter and then stored at -70 °C until further processing. Amino Terminus Amino Acid Sequencing—Subunits of recombinant human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase were separated by SDS-PAGE (6% polyacrylamide gel) (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) under reducing or non-reducing conditions and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Each subunit or a mixture of subunits was subjected to amino terminus microsequencing (15Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (performed at the Molecular Biology Resource Facility, University of Oklahoma, Health Sciences Center). GlcNAc-phosphotransferase Assay—GlcNAc-phosphate transferred to α-methylmannoside was determined with [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc as described previously (16Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Kudo M. Brem M.S. Canfield W.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 78: 451-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One unit of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity is defined as 1 pmol of GlcNAc phosphate transferred to α-methylmannoside/h in a reaction containing 150 μm UDP-GlcNAc and 100 mm α-methylmannoside. Phosphorylation of GAA—GAA was phosphorylated in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, 20 mm MnCl2, 0.0002% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 300 μm [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc at 37 °C for 1 h or 20 °C for 27 h. Protein was precipitated by adding equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid and incubating on ice for 30 min and centrifuging for 10 min. Radioactivity in the pellet was measured by the Cerenkov method. Generation of Soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase—GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is a membrane-bound enzyme, composed of three different subunits in an α2β2γ2 arrangement. Hydropathy plots of the sequences predicted that the α- and β-subunits, but not the γ-subunit, have membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 1A) (7Kudo M. Bao M. D'Souza A. Ying F. Pan H. Roe B.A. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36141-36149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To generate an engineered GlcNAc-phosphotransferase suitable for overexpression and process use, it was preferred that the enzyme be secreted and soluble in the absence of detergent. In a first attempt to generate a secreted enzyme, the cDNA sequence was modified, removing the putative membrane-spanning domains in the α- and β-subunits as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first 44 amino acids of the α-subunit were replaced by the 21-amino-acid mouse immunoglobulin κ light chain signal peptide and cleavage site sequence. The replaced region contains the signal anchor sequence (anchor, amino acids 1-10; putative transmembrane domain, amino acids 11-34) To remove the transmembrane domain in the carboxyl terminus region of the β-subunit, a stop codon was introduced into the cDNA at amino acid 1209. This deleted the carboxyl terminus 47 amino acids. To facilitate purification, the 12-amino-acid HPC4 epitope (12Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 826-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced between the signal peptide and the α-subunit (Fig. 1B). Transient Expression of Soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase Yields Inactive Enzyme—Initial studies to generate soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase were performed without co-transfection of the γ-subunit. Previously we observed that GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was expressed in the cell lysate following the transfection of 293T cells with the α/β-subunits precursor cDNA alone, suggesting that the γ-subunit is not required for activity on small molecule substrates (7Kudo M. Bao M. D'Souza A. Ying F. Pan H. Roe B.A. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36141-36149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Transfection of 293T cells with an expression plasmid encoding soluble α/β-subunits precursor (Fig. 1A) resulted in secretion of protein carrying the HPC4 epitope. Western blotting using the HPC4 antibody revealed that the protein (∼176 kDa) is expressed as a single band (∼176 kDa) at ∼1 μg/ml based on signal intensity (Fig. 2A). The GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity in the conditioned medium (409 pmol/ml/h) was 250 times higher than the activity from mock-transfected cells (1.6 pmol/ml/h). However, the apparent specific activity of the enzyme (∼409,000 pmol/mg/h) was ∼30 times less than that of purified bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (12,200,000 pmol/mg/h). This large discrepancy in specific activity suggested that the secreted enzyme was largely inactive. The Soluble α/β-Subunits Precursor Was Not Processed into Mature α- and β-Subunits—The molecular mass of the expressed protein (∼176 kDa) was slightly larger the bovine α-subunit (166 kDa (6Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)) or the predicted soluble α-subunit (∼162 kDa, calculated based on amino acid replacements). Expression in 293T cells and truncation of the transmembrane domains might affect either the extent of glycosylation or size of the glycans. Because the β-subunit was not epitope-tagged, it was impossible to determine whether the 176-kDa band represents the processed α-subunit or unprocessed α/β-subunits precursor. To clarify this issue, a plasmid expressing only the epitope-tagged soluble α-subunit (truncation at amino acid 928, Fig. 1C) was generated and expressed to provide a processed α-subunit standard. Western blotting of the medium with HPC4 antibody revealed that the product from the α/β-subunits precursor plasmid is significantly larger than the α-subunit standard, suggesting that the α/β-cleavage did not occur (Fig. 2B). This also demonstrated that the α-subunit alone is not active, which is consistent with the genetic data in ML II and ML IIIA patients (17Kudo M. Brem M.S. Canfield W.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 78: 451-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Expression of ER-targeted GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α/β-Subunits Precursor—Wild type GlcNAc-phosphotransferase resides in the ER and cis-Golgi component. Therefore, processing of the α/β-subunits precursor may require a protease localized in the ER or cis-Golgi. By converting the wild type, membrane-bound enzyme into a soluble form, the ER retention time and protease exposure might be reduced. Additionally, overexpression could have exceeded the capacity of the putative ER protease(s). Because the unprocessed enzyme appears to be ∼30-fold less active than the processed wild type enzyme, we thought any correction of the processing would result in an obvious increase in secreted activity. Therefore, only secreted enzyme activity was monitored in these experiments. To increase the retention time in the ER, the common ER retention signal (KDEL) (18Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) was added at the carboxyl terminus of the soluble α/β-subunits precursor (Fig. 1D). This approach did not increase the activity secreted in the medium (not shown). To increase ER retention time and avoid potential misfolding of the newly synthesized GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, we expressed the soluble α/β-subunits precursor at 20 °C, instead of 37 °C. However, expression at 20 °C did not increase the activity in the medium (not shown). Expression of Individual α- and β-Subunits—Because the attempts to improve processing by increasing ER retention time or improving protein folding were unsuccessful, we reasoned it might be possible to assemble an active processed enzyme by co-expression of individual subunits. The soluble α-subunit construct was previously described (Fig. 1C). To generate a soluble β-subunit construct, the κ light chain signal peptide and HPC4 epitope were appended to Thr930 (Fig. 1E). Co-expression of soluble β-subunit along with the soluble α-subunit minimally increased the activity (∼200 pmol/ml/h). However, the expression of the β-subunit was poor when the conditioned medium was examined by Western blotting using HPC4 antibody (not shown). A second approach to express individual α- and β-subunits was co-expression of two molecules that have only a single membrane-spanning domain at either the amino or carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1, F and G). We reasoned that these molecules might be better retained in ER or cis-Golgi and therefore processed more effectively. Upon processing, the precursor with the amino terminus membrane-spanning domain (Fig. 1F) might be processed into a membrane-bound α-subunit and soluble β-subunit. The precursor with the carboxyl terminus membrane-spanning domain (Fig. 1G) might be processed into a soluble α-subunit and membrane-bound β-subunit. The soluble α- and β-subunits thus produced might form an active soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. Again, this approach did not increase the activity in medium (not shown) Modification of the α/β-Subunit Junction by Addition of Proteolytic Cleavage Sites—After the failed attempts to express soluble α- and β-subunits as an active enzyme, we attempted to process the secreted α/β-subunits precursor in vitro. The amino terminus of the β-subunit (Asp929) was determined by sequencing the β-subunit in the mature, native bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. Although the carboxyl terminus of the processed bovine α-subunit is not precisely known, it must be close to amino acid 928 in the precursor according to the molecular mass the α-subunit. Therefore, the sequence of the α/β-subunits precursor near amino acid 930 was examined for potential cleavage sequences of described proteases using MacVector™ 7.2 (Accerelys). However, no protease recognition sites were found in this region. Because the native processing protease(s) could not be identified, we introduced cleavage sites for commercially available proteases (enterokinase, factor Xa, furin, or Genease I) at the α/β-subunit junction by replacing the α-subunit carboxyl terminus sequence (Figs. 1H and 3A). When the expression plasmids for these modified soluble α/β-subunits precursors were transfected to 293T cells, sequences containing enterokinase, factor Xa, or Genease I cleavage sites exhibited similar or lower activity than the soluble α/β-subunits precursor with the native cleavage site (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the sequence containing the furin cleavage site exhibited 11 times higher activity than the soluble α/β-subunits precursor with the native cleavage site (Fig. 3B, upper panel). To determine whether the increased activity from the furin site construct was because of the processing, Western blotting was performed. As shown in Fig. 3C, the protein expressed from the furin-containing sequence had a molecular mass similar to the α-subunit standard, whereas the other expressed proteins were similar in size to the unprocessed α/β-subunits precursor. The furin site-containing construct was expressed less well than others, suggesting that the higher activity observed was because of processing. We concluded that a furin-like protease(s) within the 293T cells processed and activated the soluble α/β-subunits precursor. To prepare GlcNAc-phosphotransferase with the γ-subunit, these cleavage site-modified plasmids were co-transfected with the γ-subunit plasmid. Again, the sequence containing the furin cleavage site resulted in higher activity than other sequences. However, the co-transfection with the γ-subunit resulted in ∼6 times lower activity for all the combinations (Fig. 3B, lower panel). This was due in part to the lower amount of the soluble α/β-subunits precursor plasmid used for the co-transfection. The γ-subunit appears to regulate the function of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase by restricting non-lysosomal hydrolase substrates (9Raas-Rothschild A. Cormier-Daire V. Bao M. Genin E. Salomon R. Brewer K. Zeigler M. Mandel H. Toth S. Roe B. Munnich A. Canfield W.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This regulatory role seems to reduce GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity as previously observed when the full-length α/β-subunits precursor was expressed in 293T cells in the presence and absence of the γ-subunit (7Kudo M. Bao M. D'Souza A. Ying F. Pan H. Roe B.A. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36141-36149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Structure of Recombinant Soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase—A CHO-K1 cell line stably expressing the recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression plasmid contains two expression cassettes each with a CMV promoter; one for the modified soluble α/β-subunits precursor (Fig. 1H) and the other for the full-length γ-subunit. The recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was purified by affinity chromatography over immobilized HPC4 resin. Although only the α-subunit was HPC4-tagged, all the three subunits were detected in the isolated enzyme by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). SDS-PAGE of the purified material under reducing and non-reducing conditions revealed that the α- and γ-subunits formed disulfide-linked homodimers like the native bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. The β-subunit was not disulfide-linked, again, like the native bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (Fig. 4A). Quantitative amino terminus sequencing of the whole protein revealed that these subunits are present at an ∼2.2:2:1 molar ratio. The slightly higher content of the α-subunit than the β-subunit might be because of the presence of the unprocessed α/β-subunits precursor. The lower content of the γ-subunit suggested that a portion of the purified enzyme does not contain the γ-subunit. Amino terminus sequencing showed that the α-subunit begins at Asp21 in the signal peptide, leaving an intact HPC4 epitope on the protein. The β- and γ-subunits contained the amino terminus sequence identical to the predicted sequence (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the subunit structure of the recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was α2′β2′γ2, similar to the native bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase previously described (Bao et al. (6Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31437-31445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)), whereas a portion might be α2′β2′ lacking the regulatory γ-subunit. Activity of Recombinant Soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase—The activity of the processed recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (α2′β2′γ2) was compared with native bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. Both preparations transferred ∼107 pmol of GlcNAc-phosphate to α-methylmannoside/mg/h, suggesting that transmembrane domains were not required for efficient transfer of GlcNAc-phosphate to low molecular weight acceptors. Further characterization of the enzymatic properties of the soluble recombinant enzyme showed the specificity for the α-anomeric form of the acceptor is retained (Fig. 5A). Additionally the linkage preferences for small molecule substrates were examined. As shown in Fig. 5B, the enzyme transfers GlcNAc-phosphate to the mannose dimer more efficiently when the linkage is α-1,2 (methyl 2-O-α-d-mannopyranosyl α-d-mannopyranoside) than α-1,3 (methyl 3-O-α-d-mannopyranosyl α-d-mannopyranoside) or α-methylmannoside. On the high mannose-type glycans on lysosomal enzymes, phosphorylation is mainly observed on the mannose in α-1,2-linkage (19Varki A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10847-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that the recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase maintained the same substrate preference as native GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. Phosphorylation of the Lysosomal Enzyme; Acid α-Glucosidase—To investigate substrate specificity with a lysosomal enzyme substrate, acid α-glucosidase (GAA) was chosen. GAA expressed with high mannose-type glycans was phosphorylated using the purified recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase and [32P]UDP-GlcNAc at 37 °C for 1 h. The amount of the GlcNAc-phosphate incorporated into GAA is shown in Fig. 6A. The Km for GAA was calculated to be ∼12 μm. It is similar to the Km determined for bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase using uteroferrin (22 μm) or cathepsin D (16 μm) as acceptor (10Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31446-31451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the Vmax of recombinant GlcNAc-phosphotransferase on GAA was 31 × 103 pmol/mg/h, which is ∼140 times lower than bovine enzyme on uteroferrin (10Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31446-31451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The same reaction was performed at 20 °C for a longer time (27 h) to ensure that phosphorylation can be performed at lower temperature where both GlcNAc-phosphotransferase and GAA are more stable (Fig. 6B). GAA was phosphorylated with similar Km (23 μm) and even lower Vmax (11 × 103 pmol/mg/h) at 20 °C. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the recombinant phosphotransferase itself was observed in the absence of GAA substrate (data not shown). The amount of GlcNAc-phosphate transferred to GAA was determined by subtracting the amount transferred in the absence of GAA. We concluded that the recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase retained the ability to phosphorylate a lysosomal hydrolase substrate in vitro. We have successfully generated a recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase by molecular engineering of the human GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α/β-subunits precursor cDNA. To generate this molecule, transmembrane domains on the α- and β-subunits were removed, and a furin cleavage site was introduced between the α- and β-subunits, whereas no modification was made to the γ-subunit cDNA. The recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase was expressed in mammalian cells and secreted in medium as an α2′β2′γ2 configuration identical to that of the wild type GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. This recombinant soluble enzyme transferred GlcNAc-phosphate to both synthetic small molecules (α-methylmannoside and similar derivatives) and a lysosomal enzyme substrate (GAA), demonstrating the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the α- and β-subunits are not required for the enzyme activity. The Km of the recombinant GlcNAc-phosphotransferase for GAA was similar to that of bovine GlcNAc-phosphotransferase for uteroferrin or cathepsin D, whereas the Vmax was ∼140 times lower. It was not clear whether this discrepancy in the Vmax was because of the substrate or GlcNAc-phosphotransferase itself. There were three interesting discoveries during the generation of the recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. First, the α/β-cleavage of the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase α/β-subunits precursor is necessary for optimal GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity. Second, the transmembrane domains on the α- and β-subunits are required for natural processing. Third, both the α- and β-subunits are required for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity. When the transmembrane domains from α/β-subunits precursor were removed to obtain a soluble enzyme, the secreted enzyme was almost inactive. Comparison of molecular size to the α-subunit standard revealed that the precursor was not processed into the α- and β-subunits. This suggested that the transmembrane domains are required for the processing, as discussed below. When the furin cleavage site was introduced between the α- and β-subunits, cleavage between the α- and β-subunits and the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase were both restored. Therefore, the α/β-cleavage was necessary for the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity. Furin is a calcium-dependent subtilisin-like endoprotease localized in the trans-Golgi network (20Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, UCE, the second enzyme in Man-6-P biosynthesis, is one of the substrates of furin and activated by furin in the trans-Golgi network (21Do H. Lee W. Ghosh P. Hollowell T. Canfield W.M. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29737-29744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Unlike UCE, GlcNAc-phosphotransferase does not contain a consensus cleavage sequence for furin. Instead, an unknown processing protease(s) cleaves the α/β-subunits precursor. However, when the furin cleavage site was introduced between the α- and β-subunits, the processing protease was substituted by an endogenous furin or furin-like activity. Because the majority of the recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase with furin cleavage site was processed, furin in the two cell lines used for expression (293T and CHO-K1 cells) seems to have a high capacity. The addition of a furin cleavage site might be a useful method for the expression of other proteins that require proteolytic cleavage for processing. When the transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic domains were removed from the α- and β-subunits precursor, processing was essentially abolished. This might be because 1) the retention of the precursor in the presence of the processing protease became too brief for efficient cleavage, 2) overexpression of the precursor exceeded the capacity of the processing protease(s), or 3) transmembrane domains are required for the interaction or action of the protease(s). We tried to test the first possibility by adding an ER retention signal to the carboxyl terminus of the soluble α/β-subunits precursor, but this addition did not improve the processing. Because the processing protease(s) is not identified, we could not test the second possibility by co-transfecting the processing protease with GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. The third possibility might be examined by studying the mutations found in ML II and ML IIIA patients. In ML II and ML IIIA patients, GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity is either absent or reduced, respectively. Because the unprocessed enzyme is inactive, the lack of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity in some of the patients might be because of the processing failure. Actually, some mutations in these patients are either a truncation of the carboxyl terminus transmembrane domain or a substitution in the amino terminus signal anchor domain (17Kudo M. Brem M.S. Canfield W.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 78: 451-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which is not required for the enzyme activity. Modifying and expressing the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase sequences found in these patients with the addition of a furin cleavage site will allow this hypothesis to be tested. Although the processing protease(s) for GlcNAc-phosphotransferase has not been identified, this protease(s) is likely to be in ER because the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is localized in the ER and cis-Golgi. In this study, a furin recognition sequence was added to the soluble α/β-subunits precursor to compensate for the impaired cleavage by the native processing protease(s). Because furin resides in the trans-Golgi network, the production of active GlcNAc-phosphotransferase suggests that cleavage at the later step in the secretory pathway was sufficient for the activation of the soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. The processing site and mechanism of the native membrane-bound GlcNAc-phosphotransferase must await further experimentation. Interestingly, unprocessed α/β-subunits precursor exhibited a low level of transferase activity on a small molecule substrate and to the glycans on GlcNAc-phosphotransferase itself (data not shown) but not to the lysosomal enzyme. This suggests that cleavage between the α- and β-subunits might be required for access of large molecule substrates such as lysosomal enzymes. This study also addressed the issue of the requirement for both the α- and β-subunits for activity. The UDP-GlcNAc binding site (10Bao M. Booth J.L. Elmendorf B.J. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31446-31451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and homology to the bacterial capsular polymerases (7Kudo M. Bao M. D'Souza A. Ying F. Pan H.

Although all of the evidence to localize the enzymatic functions of the enzyme implicates the α-subunit, the β-subunit is required for unknown reasons. This is proven by the failure of transfection of the α-subunit alone to generate GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity as well as genetic data showing that truncation of the β-subunit results in GlcNAc-phosphotransferase deficiency (8Tiede S.

The recombinant soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase maintained substrate preference similar to native GlcNAc-phosphotransferase. The enzyme preferred mannose in the α-anomer to the β-anomer. It also preferred mannose in Manα1→2Manα→Me linkage to Manα1→3Manα→ Me linkage, although we could not specify which mannose residue in these molecules was actually phosphorylated. Such preference matches the location of Man-6-P on the high mannose-type glycans on lysosomal enzymes (19Varki A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10847-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Varki A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2808-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble GlcNAc-phosphotransferase also transferred GlcNAc-phosphate to a natural substrate, a lysosomal enzyme. This soluble recombinant GlcNAc-phosphotransferase, together with the soluble recombinant UCE we described previously, allows the potential to in vitro phosphorylate therapeutic lysosomal enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2145471850,"The physiological effects of a variety of N6-substituted adenine and adenosine derivatives called cytokinins have been documented in plants, but information on their occurrence and function in other biological system is limited. Here we investigated the anti-proliferative effect of N6-isopentenyladenosine (i6A), an adenosine and isoprenoid derivative, in a thyroid cell system, FRTL-5 wild-type, and K-ras transformed KiMol cells. Addition of i6A to FRTL-5 cells caused a dose-dependent arrest of the G0-G1 cell phase transition associated with a reduction of cells in the S phase that was much more evident in KiMol cells. I6A arrested tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) and protein prenylation. Indeed the addition of farnesol reversed these effects and i6A affected protein prenylation, in particular lamin B processing. I6A effect was not mediated by the adenosine receptor but was due to a direct modulation of FPPS enzyme activity as a result of its uptake inside the cells. I6A inhibited FPPS activity more efficaciously in KiMol cells than in normal FRTL-5. Moreover, the i6A anti-proliferative effect was evaluated in vivo in a nude mouse xenograft model, where KiMol cells were implanted subcutaneously. Mice treated with i6A showed a drastic reduction in tumor volume. Our findings indicate that this isoprenoid end product might be used for antineoplastic therapy, an application emulating that of the lovastatin and/or farnesyl-transferase inhibitors"
https://openalex.org/W2075064466,"Activation loop phosphorylation plays critical regulatory roles for many kinases. Unlike other protein kinase Cs (PKC), PKC-δ does not require phosphorylation of its activation loop (Thr-507) for in vitro activity. We investigated the structural basis for this unusual capacity and its relevance to PKC-δ function in intact cells. Mutational analysis demonstrated that activity without Thr-507 phosphorylation depends on 20 residues N-terminal to the kinase domain and a pair of phenylalanines (Phe-500/Phe-527) unique to PKC-δ in/near the activation loop. Molecular modeling demonstrated that these elements stabilize the activation loop by forming a hydrophobic chain of interactions from the C-lobe to activation loop to N-terminal (helical) extension. In cells PKC-δ mediates both apoptosis and transcription regulation. We found that the T507A mutant of the PKC-δ kinase domain resembled the corresponding wild type in mediating apoptosis in transfected HEK293T cells. But the T507A mutant was completely defective in AP-1 and NF-κB reporter assays. A novel assay in which the kinase domain of PKC-δ and its substrate (a fusion protein of PKC substrate peptide with green fluorescent protein) were co-targeted to lipid rafts revealed a major substrate-selective defect of the T507A mutant in phosphorylating the substrate in cells. In vitro analysis showed strong product inhibition on the T507A mutant with particular substrates whose characteristics suggest it contributes to the substrate selective defect of the PKC-δ T507A mutant in cells.

Protein kinase C (PKC) 2The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; WT, wild type; aa, amino acid(s); PKA, protein kinase A; CK II, casein kinase II; MLK, mixed lineage kinase. is a family of 9 genes that can be further divided into classical, novel, and atypical PKCs, depending on their structural characteristics and their requirement for activation (1Parker P.J. Murray-Rust J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 131-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 3-7PubMed Google Scholar). Each of them is autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction of the kinase domain with an N-terminal regulatory domain, whose organization differs between subfamilies. Classic PKCs have C1 and C2 domains that bind diacylglycerol and Ca2+, respectively, for their activation. Novel PKCs have a C1 domain that binds diacylglycerol, but their C2-like domain does not bind Ca2+. Atypical PKCs do not have the ability to bind either Ca2+ or diacylglycerol, but are activated by other lipids or small G-proteins. Binding of the regulatory region with appropriate cofactors causes a conformational change that releases the auto-inhibition and results in activation. Besides the co-factor-induced conformational change, PKC activity is also regulated by phosphorylation on its kinase domain, most importantly on its activation loop (3Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 4Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The activation loop is a stretch of 20-30 amino acids located in the catalytic cleft of the kinase domain of all eukaryotic protein kinases that form part of the substrate peptide binding surface. The activation loop is relatively flexible, and undergoes varied forms of conformation regulation between the active and inactive states (5Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 6Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar, 7Engh R.A. Bossemeyer D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2001; 41: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One of the most common modes of kinase regulation is by phosphorylation of residues in the activation loop (8Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 9Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). When phosphorylated, the negatively charged phosphate forms critical interactions with charged residues on the kinase domain, stabilizing an active conformation. In some cases, there are no phosphorylation sites on the activation loop, but instead a negatively charged residue serves as a functional replacement for the phosphate group. There are also kinases that do not need negative charge on the activation loop to be active. Generally, PKCs depend on activation loop phosphorylation for their kinase activity. It is believed that most PKCs are well phosphorylated at its kinase domain shortly after synthesis (2Newton A.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 3-7PubMed Google Scholar, 4Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). So most cellular PKC is “competent,” but its activity is autoinhibited until it is released by a conformational change caused by co-factor binding. But PKC-δ is a special case; the dependence of its activity on activation loop phosphorylation is still a point of controversy. Some studies have found that the activation loop-dephosphorylated mutant of PKC-δ was still fully active in the in vitro kinase assay (10Stempka L. Girod A. Muller H.J. Rincke G. Marks F.

J. 2002; 361: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Others found that PKC-δ only had minimal activity when not phosphorylated, and its activity increased about 10-fold when phosphorylated on its activation loop (13Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Although various possible explanations have been proposed, the cause of the discrepancy is still unclear. In contrast to PKC-δ, the catalytic activity of the closest isoform, PKC-θ, is strictly dependent on activation loop phosphorylation (12Liu Y. Graham C. Li A. Fisher R. Shaw S. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because the two kinases have 87% sequence similarity in the kinase domain, they constitute an informative pair for investigating the structural basis of the unique functional properties of PKC-δ. As noted above, activation loop phosphorylation is generally constitutive in novel and classical PKCs in cells. In contrast, although PKC-δ is constitutively phosphorylated on its activation loop in some cell types, in a variety of contexts it undergoes regulated activation loop phosphorylation or dephosphorylation in cells (13Le Good J.A.

It is appealing that this phosphorylation has an important regulatory role in cells, but that possibility has been clouded by the controversy regarding the functional effect of phosphorylation at this site. We therefore investigated in greater detail the structural basis of activity regulation by phosphorylation of Thr-507 and the functional consequences thereof. Using a combination of mutational analysis, structural modeling, and molecular dynamics we have identified the molecular basis for stabilization of the activation loop of PKC-δ in the absence of phosphorylation. Moreover, our assessment of its functional capacity demonstrates both an altered range of substrates in cells and increased susceptibility to product inhibition in vitro. Of particular interest, we find that phosphorylation of Thr-507 is not required for apoptosis, one of the most notable functions of PKC-δ in cells. DNA Constructs—PKC-δ cDNA constructs have been described previously (12Liu Y. Graham C. Li A. Fisher R. Shaw S. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PKC-δ kinase domain and substrate (MARCKS and CREB) constructs were created using the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). The kinase domains (with or without the 20-residue N-terminal extension) are from human protein: PKC-δ (aa 329-676 or 349-676). Targeted substrate constructs were made by cloning the annealed oligonucleotides coding for the following peptide sequence into the pDest516 Gateway destination vector with Lck targeting motif and HA tag at the N-terminal and green fluorescent protein tag at the C terminus: human MARCKS aa 154-168 (KKKRFSFKKSFKLSG) and CREB aa 126-140 (EILSRRPSYRKILND) (supplemental Fig. 6A). Antibodies and Peptides—Anti-HA tag mAb and HA peptide were purchased from BabCO; anti-PKC-δ pT507, phospho-MARCKS and CREB antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies. MLK3 (QQVDRERPHVRRRRGpTFKRS) and PARIS1 (EYLERRApSRRRAV) phosphopeptides and the corresponding non-phosphopeptide were synthesized by Peptron Inc.; PKC-α pseudosubstrate peptide was purchased from Biomol. The panel of 96 proteomic peptides was synthesized by AxCell Biosciences as previously described (17Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Transfection, Apoptosis Assay, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot—HEK293T cell transfection was done with calcium phosphate using standard procedures. For apoptosis assay, 20 h after transfection the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, stained with HA mAb and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and observed with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. The transfected cells were lysed with lysis buffer: 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm Na4P2O7, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, lysate from one 10-cm dish was combined with 2 μg of HA mAb and then 20 μl of recombinant protein G-agarose (Invitrogen). For Western blot, the immunoprecipitate or cell lysate in the SDS sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot was done using the Amersham Biosciences ECL kit following the manufacturer's protocol. NF-κB and AP-1 reporter assays in transfected Jurkat cell were done as described previously (12Liu Y. Graham C. Li A. Fisher R. Shaw S. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assays with PKC-δ were generally done using eluted purified kinase (Figs. 4, 5, 6 and 8) or in a few experiments by an immune complex assay (Figs. 1 and 2). The immune complex kinase assay was done as described previously (12Liu Y. Graham C. Li A. Fisher R. Shaw S. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, PKC constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells, and immunoprecipitated using HA mAb. The immune complex kinase assay was done using 20 μm PKC-α pseudo-substrate peptide as substrate, which was captured onto P81 paper and emissions were counted. The kinase buffer contains 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2,20 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 100 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. A fraction of the immunoprecipitated PKC was blotted with HA mAb, quantitated, and assays adjusted to equal concentrations.FIGURE 5PKC-δ T507A has reduced activity toward some substrate peptides only at high concentrations. Detailed analysis of the concentration dependence of phosphorylation of four peptides chosen from Fig. 4. For two peptides, PARIS I and D40, phosphorylation by WT and T507A was almost the same. But for the other two peptides, MLK3 and diacylglycerol kinase-ι, phosphorylation by T507A decreased at high peptide concentrations resulting in deviation from the behavior of the WT kinase (A). A time course of phosphorylation of the MLK3 peptide and PARIS1 peptide by either PKC-δ WT or T507A was done.

A and B, a Lck-targeted kinase domain construct (WT or T507A) was transfected into HEK293T cells together with an HA-tagged substrate construct containing the PKC phosphorylation site from MARCKS (A) or CREB (B). After 18 h the cells were lysed. Phosphorylation of the substrate construct was assessed by Western blot with the corresponding phospho-specific antibody. The MARCKS substrate was phosphorylated only by WT PKC-δ (A), whereas the CREB substrate was phosphorylated by both (B). Expression of the substrate constructs (MARCKS or CREB) and the kinase domain constructs was assessed by Western blot with antibodies against peptide tags. Western blot results were quantitated and represented in a bar graph in which phosphorylation by WT is shown as 100% and phosphorylation by T507A was expressed as percent of the WT. Note that the CREB substrate undergoes a mobility shift after phosphorylation. The arrowhead indicates the position of a slightly lower mobility nonspecific band that is also seen in untransfected cells (not shown). C and D, PKC-δ WT or T507A protein was purified from transfected HEK293T cells, adjusted to equal protein concentrations by Western blot comparisons, and the immune complex kinase assay was done with serially diluted MARCKS peptide (C) or CREB peptide (D) as substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 1Two phenylalanines (Phe-500 and Phe-527) are critical for PKC-δ kinase activity when without activation loop phosphorylation.

Comparisons of the relative kinase activity of different constructs were made from in vitro kinase assays performed at equal kinase concentrations as determined by Western blots. For kinase assays using biotinylated peptides (Figs. 4, 5, 6), phosphorylation was assessed by capture of peptides onto streptavidin-coated plates as described previously (17Fujii K. Zhu G. Liu Y. Hallam J. Chen L. Herrero J. Shaw S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13744-13749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Km for ATP was assessed using PKC-α pseudo-substrate peptide as substrate and ATP concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 400 μm. In-cell Phosphorylation Assay—Lck motif-targeted PKC-δ kinase domain constructs and substrate (MARCKS and CREB) constructs were co-transfected into HEK293T cells. 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed. The cell lysate was blotted with HA-tagged mAb, to determine expression of both kinase domain and substrate constructs, and pMARCKS/pCREB antibody, to determine phosphorylation of the substrates. For all assays, all results shown are representatives of at least two independent experiments with similar results. Molecular Modeling—The spatial structure model of PKC-δ was constructed based on the known structure of protein kinases: PKC-θ, Protein Data Bank codes 1XJD; AKT2, 1O6L; and PKA, 1L3R, using the COMPOSER subroutine of SYBYL (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). Models of T507A and T507A/F500L mutants were made by creating point mutations. The molecular coordinates of the atoms in those mutants were first optimized by potential energy minimization using SYLBL subroutines and AMBER Force Fields. Terms of the energy function used for optimization include bond stretching, angle bending, torsional energy, van der Waals energy terms, electrostatic energy terms, and hydrogen bonding terms. For each of the mutants 10 short independent molecular dynamic simulations were carried out in the presence of solvent (box 77 × 62 × 62 Å with ∼8,000 water molecules) at 300 K. These minimized models were then further optimized in SYBYL by “heating,” which allows atoms to further reposition into even more energy-optimal conformational states. The total time of each molecular dynamic simulation was 20 ps; the Verlet algorithm, one of numerical algorithms for integrating the equations of motion in potential energy function (i.e. for calculating the trajectories of particles), was used with 1-fs steps. Two Phenylalanines In/Near the Activation Loop of PKC-δ Are Involved in Maintaining Kinase Activity—We sought a structural explanation for the dramatic difference shown previously between PKC-θ and -δ in their dependence on activation loop phosphorylation. We explored the possibility that sequence differences between PKC-δ and -θ, which are critical to maintaining an active conformation without phosphorylation are: 1) residues in the activation loop itself; and 2) residues that directly contact the activation loop. Although no structure is available for the PKC-δ kinase domain, the similarity between PKC-δ and PKC-θ made it straightforward to find such residues in a “first-pass” homology model. The notable differences are in the activation loop itself and ∼15 residues thereafter that are located in the C-lobe. Two Phe residues (Phe-500 and Phe-527) are notable among the few non-conservative changes (Fig. 1). Three attributes made them particularly interesting: 1) Phe is a very hydrophobic residue often involved in hydrophobic stacks that provide stable interactions. 2) They are located sufficiently close in the spatial model to make a hydrophobic stack between them plausible. 3) PKC-δ is the only PKC with a Phe at both positions, which could explain its uniqueness. As an initial test of whether these Phe were critical to activation loop independence of PKC-δ, functional studies were performed with mutant constructs. The two Phe residues were mutated to the corresponding residue in PKC-θ (F500L/F527H); mutations were made both in the wild type (WT) PKC-δ and PKC-δ mutant whose activation loop is unable to be phosphorylated (T507A). In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that mutation of either Phe (or both) dramatically decreased kinase activity of PKC-δ T507A (Fig. 1B). These Phe were unusually important because mutation of other residues corresponding to non-conservative changes (I499M, A505T, and T526N) did not have any significant effect on kinase activity of PKC-δ T507A (Fig. 1B). When the same analysis was conducted with mutants on the WT background, the Phe mutation did not have any defect. Thus the two Phe are critical for kinase activity only when the activation loop is not phosphorylated. The N-terminal Extension of the Kinase Domain Helps Maintain Kinase Activity by Interactions with the Activation Loop—Two considerations prompted us to consider the possibility that residues N-terminal to the kinase domain contribute to activation loop stabilization. (a) A mutant of PKC-θ in which the residues corresponding to Phe-500 and Phe-527 in PKC-δ (Leu-531 and His-558) are mutated to Phe is still not active without activation loop phosphorylation, suggesting requirements beyond the two Phe for activity. (b) Modest sequence similarity between PKC-δ and the A-helix of PKA (Fig. 2A) suggested that PKC-δ might have an α-helix. This would be relevant because the α-helix in PKA (“A-helix”) plays a role in stabilizing the kinase domain (18Breitenlechner C. Engh R.A. Huber R. Kinzel V. Bossemeyer D. Gassel M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7743-7749Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the sequence N-terminal to the kinase domain plays a role in stabilizing PKC-δ, we made four PKC-δ kinase domain-only constructs varying with respect to: 1) presence versus absence of 20 residues of the N-terminal sequence (aa 329-348) and 2) WT versus T507A. The in vitro kinase activity of T507A is markedly impaired in the absence of the N-terminal extension but close to normal with that extension (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the presence of a phosphorylatable activation loop (WT) allows PKC-δ to function normally without its N-terminal extension. Thus, the N-terminal extension, like the pair of Phe, is necessary for kinase activity only in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation. Structural modeling was undertaken to determine a structural explanation for the experimental results with the above constructs. Our model of the kinase domain per se was based on the solved structure of its closest paralog, PKC-θ (Protein Data Bank code 1XJD). Two elements that are important for a functional kinase but are missing from that structure were derived from other closely related kinases: part of the C-terminal extension (aa 619-633) from AKT2 (PDB code 1O6L) and the rest (aa 636-645) from PKA (PDB code 1L3R), and the A helix (aa 320-340) from PKA (PDB 1L3R). An important feature of the model is molecular interactions of the A-helix with the “bottom” of the kinase domain (Fig. 3). Its interaction with the C-helix is virtually identical to that observed in PKA, based on the conservation of critical Arg on the C-helix and a Trp on the A-helix. An interesting difference, however, is observed in the remainder of its interactions. In PKA the A-helix has strong hydrophobic interactions with a major hydrophobic groove on the bottom of the C-lobe (18Breitenlechner C. Engh R.A. Huber R. Kinzel V. Bossemeyer D. Gassel M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7743-7749Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the PKC-δ model the A-helix does not interact directly with the C-lobe but rather is connected to the C-lobe indirectly via hydrophobic residues in a short “insertion” in the activation loop (i.e. in PKCs but not PKA, Fig. 1A). Specifically, 1) Tyr-334 in the A-helix interacts with Phe-500 in the activation loop; and 2) Ile-499 in the activation loop interacts with Phe-527 in the C-lobe. Thus, the three structural elements found experimentally to be important for PKC-δ catalysis in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation (Phe-500, Phe-527, and A-helix) are all involved in this chain of hydrophobic interactions unique to PKC-δ. The surface features of these structural elements that create the hydrophobic interactions are depicted in supplemental Fig. 1. Molecular dynamics was used to investigate in more detail the position and function of critical phenylalanine residues Phe-500 and Phe-527. In the case of WT PKC-δ an unusual predominance of a single conformation was observed during multiple simulations, suggesting that this conformation is strongly favored. Preference of that conformation also was observed in models of T507A, but when Phe-500 is substituted by Leu the structure becomes more flexible mainly because of the loss of the tight interaction between Phe-500 and Tyr-334, indicating the special role of those aromatic residues in maintaining this stabilization of the activation loop. This favored conformation is controlled by distinctive interactions of Phe-500 with Tyr-334 and Phe-527 with Ile-499. Thus, the two Phe residues unique to PKC-δ appear to be essential to form that stable conformation. It is notable that the structural elements necessary for this stabilization (the pair of Phe residues and motif in N-terminal region) have been conserved in most vertebrates (mouse, rat, dog, xenopus, and even pufferfish). Analysis of ATP binding (supplemental Fig. 2) shows that the double Phe mutant F500L/F527H has a ∼2-fold increase in the Km for ATP, confirming the role of those Phe in optimizing kinase domain conformation. This alteration was less than the increase caused by the T507A mutation, which was ∼4-fold. The T507A mutant also had altered lipid dependence for activation (supplemental Fig. 3) as previously described (14Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol.

Furthermore, there are no structural data regarding VEGF-C interaction with its receptors. A mutant form of VEGF-C, which has lost its VEGFR-2 binding activity has been described, but the role of the mutated amino acid residue in receptor binding has not been analyzed (10Joukov V. Kumar V. Sorsa T. Arighi E. Weich H. Saksela O. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6599-6602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Rational design of ligands often employs modification of their receptor binding profiles on the basis of structural data (11Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3407-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Conversely, here we have deduced structural information from receptor binding data. To screen for structural elements of VEGF-C involved in specific receptor interactions, we created a library of mosaic molecules from VEGF and VEGF-C. Additional to the evaluation of individual residues based on the loss of ligand affinity upon mutation, we grafted VEGF-C segments into VEGF to gain VEGFR-3 binding. Because such DNA shuffling did not resolve the interaction determinants at the individual residue level, we scanned the regions that conferred VEGFR-3 binding by alanine mutagenesis to identify the residues that are important for specific receptor interaction. Finally, we showed in vivo that the introduction of additional receptor affinities into VEGF or VEGF-C modifies their biological effects, creating dual angiogenic/lymphangiogenic properties, which are somewhat weaker than the angiogenic and lymphangiogenic effects of VEGF and VEGF-C, respectively. Creation and Screening of the VEGF/VEGF-C Mosaic Library—We maximized the identity of nucleotide sequences coding for the VEGF homology domain of VEGF and VEGF-C by silent mutagenesis (see the supplemental data). Two sets of nine DNA fragments coding for segments of VEGF and VEGF-C, respectively, were synthesized. The overhangs of these fragments corresponded to stretches of 100% nucleotide sequence identity between VEGF and VEGF-C. Two or three adjacent fragments were simultaneously ligated into a modified pKO Scrambler V912 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Thus, four different vector sets were obtained (Fig. 1B). Two vector sets were then combined into 32 different vectors coding for the N-terminal halves of the mosaic molecules. Similarly, the two other vector sets were combined into 16 different vectors coding for the C-terminal halves. The final ligation created 512 different vectors. The expression plasmid pMosaic that hosted the library was constructed using sequences from pSecTagA and pICZα-A (both from Invitrogen), site-directed mutagenesis, and synthetic linkers. pMosaic contained a cytomegalovirus promoter, the immunoglobulin κ leader peptide for secretion, a C-terminal Myc epitope, and a hexahistidine tag for detection. The assembly of the library is schematically shown in Fig. 1B, and details can be found as supplemental data. All 512 constructs were separately transfected into 293T cells. After metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 24 h, the conditioned medium was immunoprecipitated with anti-pentahistidine antibody (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and VEGFR extracellular domain/immunoglobulin G Fc (VEGFR/IgGFc) fusion proteins. For the latter, the medium was supplemented with bovine serum albumin and heparin to final concentrations of 1% and 0.1 μg/ml. The protein A-bound fraction was analyzed in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Construction of VEGFR/IgGFc Expression Vectors—To construct the VEGFR-2/IgGFc expression plasmid, the first three Ig homology domains of the extracellular part of VEGFR-2 were amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GCGGATCCTTGCCTAGTGTTTCTCTTGAC-3′ and 5′-CCAGTCACCTGCTCCGGATCTTCATGGACCCTGACAAATG-3′ and cloned into the Signal pIgplus vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmid was cut with BamHI and KpnI, treated with T4 polymerase, and ligated to itself. The expression plasmids for VEG-FR-2/IgGFc and VEGFR-3/IgGFc (12Makinen T. Jussila L. Veikkola T.

The Ig homology domain 1 was deleted from the expression plasmid VEGFR-3/IgGFc by site-directed mutagenesis using primers 5′-CCTTGAACATCACGGAGGAGTCACACGTCAGAGACTTTGAGCAGCCATTCATCAACAAGC-3′ and 5′-AGCTGCTGGTAGGGGAGAAGGATCCTGAACTGCACCGTGTGG-3′ and excision of the BamHI fragment from the resulting plasmid. The plasmid coding for VEGFR-3 domains 2 and 3 was constructed by transfer of the SphI fragment from the original expression plasmid VEGFR-3/IgGFc into the plasmid encoding only VEGFR-3 domain 2. The sequences encoding four different versions of domain 2 of VEGFR-2 were amplified using forward primer 5′-AGCGCTAGCGTTCAAGATTACAGATCTCC-3′ and reverse primers 5′-CTAGGATCCCCTACAACGACAACTATG-3′,5′-CTAGGATCCACATCATAAATCCTATAC-3′,5′-GCATGGTCTCGGATCATGAGACGGACTCAGAAC-3′, and 5′-CTAGGATCCTTTTCTCCAACAGATAG-3′; subsequently the NheI- and BamHI- or BsaI-cut PCR products were subcloned into NheI and BamHI-cut Signal pIgplus vector. VEGFR Phosphorylation, Bioassay, and Determination of Relative Affinities Using Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Receptor phosphorylation was analyzed in porcine aortic endothelial VEGFR-2 (13Waltenberger J.

To determine the relative affinities of the VEGF/VEGF-C mosaics, serial dilutions of competing VEGF165 or ΔNΔC-VEGF-C and VEGFR/IgGFc were added in a subsaturating 1:15 molar ratio to MaxiSorp microtiter plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) coated with 400 ng of purified growth factor. After 16 h, the receptors bound to the plate were quantified using biotinylated mouse anti-human IgGFc and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (both from Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), and the competitor concentration that resulted in half-maximal binding of VEGFR/IgGFc to mosaic molecules was determined (EC50, absolute values given in the supplemental data). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Binding of VEGF-C and its mutants to VEGFR-1, -2, and -3 were analyzed with surface plasmon resonance in the Biacore 2000™ biosensor (Uppsala, Sweden). Flow cells of a CM5 biosensor chip were covalently coated with VEGFR/IgGFc fusion proteins via standard amine coupling. The binding of the alanine scan mutants was then analyzed in the standard Biacore running buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P-20) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The kinetics of the VEGF-C interaction with VEGFR-2 and -3 were determined at varying concentrations of VEGF-C (20-300 nm) over a surface to which 1500 resonance units of the respective receptor had been coupled. The VEGFR-2 and -3-immobilized flow cells were regenerated after every injection with a pulse of 100 or 20 mm hydrochloric acid, respectively. The coupling level used in the screening experiments of the interactions was chosen to be 6000 resonance units for VEGFR-2, and the concentration of VEGF-C mutants was 1 μm. The coupling level of the more reusable VEGFR-3 surface was kept at 1500 resonance units, and the concentration for screening of mutants was chosen to be 100 nm. Replicative screening experiments were done on freshly coupled surfaces. The coupling levels of the receptors and the concentrations of the mutants varied between the experiments. The contact time of VEGF-C and its mutants was 5 min and the flow rate 20 μl/min. The data were evaluated by first subtracting the sensorgram obtained from the empty control flow cell from the sensorgrams of the flow cells containing VEGFR-2 or -3. The obtained curves were fitted to the natural logarithmic 1:1 Langmuir binding model of the BiaEvaluation 3.1 software package (Biacore) to obtain the relative binding levels and the relative dissociation constants of the mutated VEGF-C proteins. Protein Production, Purification, and Gel Filtration—Ten selected mosaic VEGFs were produced in insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac system. Sf9 and High Five cells were maintained in Sf900II (all Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the supplier. First, the coding sequences for the melittin signal peptide and a hexahistidine tag were inserted into the transfer vector pFASTBAC1 as described previously (20Gerhardt H. Golding M. Fruttiger M. Ruhrberg C. Lundkvist A. Abramsson A. Jeltsch M. Mitchell C. Alitalo K. Shima D. Betsholtz C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2139) Google Scholar), and subsequently, the coding sequences of the VEGF/VEGF-C mosaic molecules were subcloned into this construct. Details about the growth factors and control proteins are listed in the supplemental data. To produce the proteins for the VEGFR-1 bioassay, the conditioned medium of the baculovirus-infected High Five cells was concentrated 50-fold using Centricon C-10 spin columns (Millipore, Bedford, MA) diluted into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the concentration of the mosaic molecules was determined by densitometry. To purify protein for the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, conditioned medium of High Five cells was harvested 72 h after infection and dialyzed against 30 mm sodium phosphate and 400 mm sodium chloride, pH 6. The pH was adjusted to 8.0, and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) was added. The samples were agitated for 12 h at + 4 °C. The resin was then collected and applied to the chromatography columns. The columns were washed with 30 mm sodium phosphate, 400 mm sodium chloride, 600 mm glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole at pH 8.0, and the bound proteins were eluted with imidazole, dialyzed against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and sterilized using Millex-GV filters (Millipore). The proteins were checked in silver-stained 15% polyacrylamide gels and quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Coding sequences for the alanine scan mutants used in the surface plasmon resonance analysis and the VEGFR-2/VEGFR-3 bioassays were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using megaprime-based PCR mutagenesis or the QuikChange method (Stratagene). Coding sequences were then subcloned into the pMT-BiP/V5HisC vector (Invitrogen) for expression in insect cells. Protein from 50 ml of HyQ Sfx insect medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) conditioned for 5 days by stably expressing S2 cells was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as described above followed by buffer exchange against standard Biacore running buffer using a HR10/10 Fast Desalting column on an Äkta Explorer (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK). Gel filtration was performed on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) calibrated with a gel filtration low molecular weight calibration kit (GE Healthcare) using phosphate-buffered saline as eluent, a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min, and a sample volume of 200 μl. Analysis was performed using the Unicorn 4.1 software package (GE Healthcare). CAM Assay—The CAM assay was carried out as described previously (21Oh S.J. Jeltsch M.M. Birkenhager R. McCarthy J.E. Weich H.A. Christ B. Alitalo K. Wilting J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Disks punched from Thermanox coverslips (Nunc) with the sterile salt- and carrier-free protein were applied to day 13 CAM, and after 3 days, the specimens were either fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or 0.5% ZnCl and embedded into paraffin or embedded into TissueTek and subsequently frozen. Specimens were photographed in an Olympus SZX9 stereomicroscope. Carrier disks alone and human serum albumin were used as negative controls. Quantitation of angiogenesis in the transparent CAM was based on the optical density of the digitized microphotographs using computer-assisted image analysis (22Maragoudakis M.E. Haralabopoulos G.C. Tsopanoglou N.E. Pipili-Synetos E. Miscrovasc. Res. 1995; 50: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mean relative optical density was measured from vessels with a diameter <0.1 mm using the program ImageJ (23Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophot. Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). Lymphangiogenesis was quantitated from four 1125-μm view fields from hematoxylin and eosinstained CAM sections located at the rim of the application disks. The ratio between the area occupied by lymphatic spaces and the total area was determined using ImageJ (23Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophot. Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed on sections of CAMs treated with 2.5 μg (control proteins) or 25 μg (mosaic proteins) of growth factor. Antiserum against Prox-1 was raised in rabbits (24Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Makela T.P. Saarela J. Virtanen I. Ferrell R.E. Finegold D.N. Kerjaschki D. Yla-Herttuala S. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4593-4599Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar); the protein A-bound fraction was used for the staining of unfixed frozen sections. Anti-α-smooth muscle actin (anti-αSMA) antibody (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:100, and the von Willebrand Factor antiserum (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) at a 1:300 dilution was used for the paraffin sections or at 1:500 on frozen sections. Mosaic VEGFs with Novel Receptor Binding Profiles—Based on eight hot spots of sequence homology at the nucleotide level (supplemental data), we fragmented the VEGF homology domains of VEGF and VEGF-C into nine subunits and swapped the homologous fragments in all combinations (Fig. 1). All clones were transiently expressed in 293T cells, and the factors were precipitated from the conditioned medium of metabolically labeled cells using soluble VEGFR/IgGFc fusion proteins. To our surprise, the library contained molecules with all possible receptor binding combinations (summarized in Table 1), including 10 factors binding to all three VEGF receptors (called here “super-VEGFs”). On the other hand, most of the molecules containing VEGF-derived fragment 3 and VEGF-C-derived fragment 7 were not secreted by the transfected cells (supplemental data).TABLE 1Receptor binding frequencies among mosaic VEGFsReceptor binding profilenVEFGR-1 and VEFGR-226VEFGR-2 and VEFGR-328VEFGR-125VEFGR-225VEFGR-326VEFGR-1 and VEFGR-33All three VEFGR receptors10None255Not expressed or not secreted114Total512 Open table in a new tab Composition of the Mosaic Molecules—The apparent molecular masses of the dominant polypeptide species (19 or 21 kDa) were 4 or 6 kDa higher than predicted from the amino acid sequence. A comparison of the mobilities of the recombinant proteins shown in Fig. 2A and the schematic structures shown in Fig. 2E indicate that the reason for the size difference is the utilization of the N-linked glycosylation sites in fragments 7 (both VEGF and VEGF-C) and 9 (VEGF-C). Enzymatic deglycosylation and analysis of glycosylation-deficient mutants of VEGF-C confirmed that VEGF-C indeed uses both potential N-glycosylation sites (supplemental data). The compositions, apparent molecular masses, and receptor binding profiles of 10 mosaic molecules that were selected for further analysis are described in Fig. 2E. The pattern of receptor interaction correlated with the composition of the mosaic molecules. VEGF-derived fragments 2 and 7 were required for VEGFR-1 binding, as none of the molecules with these fragments derived from VEGF-C could bind VEGFR-1. However, many mosaic molecules containing VEGF-derived fragments 2 and 7 bound efficiently to VEGFR-2 and -3; thus, these fragments were classified as “promiscuous.” Also, fragment 3 of VEGF favored VEGFR-1 binding. Although required, fragments 2, 3, and 7 alone were not sufficient for VEGFR-1 binding. VEGFR-3 Specificity and Binding Determinants—Unlike the binding to VEGFR-1, which depended strictly on VEGF-derived fragments 2 and 7, no single fragment of VEGF-C was absolutely required for binding to VEGFR-3. However, a bias toward VEGF-C-derived fragments was observed in the presumed bottom face of the molecule (fragments 4, 5, and 8). A predominantly VEGF-derived bottom face of the molecule precluded VEGFR-3 binding. Of the 67 VEGFR-3 binding molecules, 52, 56, and 45 had VEGF-C-derived fragments 4, 5, and 8, respectively. The importance of VEGF-C-derived fragments 4 and 8 for VEGFR-3 binding is exemplified in mosaic molecule 14-9, where these two fragments alone are sufficient to introduce VEGFR-3 binding into VEGF. Analogous to the promiscuous VEGF-derived fragments 2 and 7, the presence of VEGF-C-derived fragments 4, 5, and 8 did not inhibit VEGFR-1 or -2 binding. Identification of Critical Residues by a Mutagenesis Scan of VEGF-C—To determine how individual amino acid residues within fragments 4, 5, and 8 were contributing to receptor binding, we mutated the non-conserved residues in these fragments into alanine residues to evaluate their effects on VEGFR-3 and -2 binding by surface plasmon resonance analysis (Fig. 3). Only a few single amino acid mutants showed a pronounced increase in the apparent Kd for VEGFR-3, with the Cys156→Ala mutation being most efficient in reducing both VEGFR-2 and -3 binding. When the same cysteine residue was mutated into a serine residue, only VEGFR-2 binding was compromised, with VEGFR-3 binding remaining largely unaffected. To determine the cause of this difference, we used gel filtration to check the dimerization status of these mutants. For the Cys156→Ala mutant, the molar ratio of monomeric to dimeric molecules was 4.6 to 1. However, this can only partially explain the difference, because the Cys156→Ser mutant also showed a significant monomeric component with a molar ratio of 2 to 1. In fragments 4 and 8, the highest increase in the apparent Kd for VEGFR-3 binding was observed upon mutation of Phe151 and Pro198 residues, respectively. We confirmed that the increase of apparent Kd and the reduction in total binding translated into reduced signaling using a cell growth/survival bioassay in Ba/F3 cells expressing a chimeric VEGFR-3EC/Epo or VEGFR-2EC/Epo receptor (Fig. 3). For several mutants, notably the double deletion of Leu192 and Ser193, the reduction of activity in the bioassay was higher than expected when compared with other mutants whose apparent Kd and binding level were altered to a similar degree. A marked exception was the Pro198→Ala mutant of VEGF-C; its complex with VEGFR-3 appeared to be very unstable. However, neither total ligand binding nor survival signaling in the Ba/F3 assay were significantly affected. The Minimal VEGF-C Binding Fragment of VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2—The extent of the extracellular domain necessary for VEGF binding differs between VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. The second extracellular Ig homology domain of VEGFR-1 alone is sufficient for VEGF binding, whereas VEGFR-2 also requires the presence of the third domain. Moreover, the exact amount of linker between domains 2 and 3 of VEGFR-1 determines whether a specific domain 2-only construct can bind VEGF (4Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). To determine how much of the linker between the corresponding domains of VEGFR-2 and -3 is necessary for VEGF-C binding, we created a series of successive receptor deletion mutants. VEGF-C bound efficiently to soluble fusion proteins containing domains 1 and 2 of VEGFR-3 plus the linker between domains 2 and 3 up to Gly226 (supplemental data). When three additional residues were deleted, the fusion protein failed to be expressed. Thus, the minimal VEGF-C binding fragment of VEGFR-3 appears to extend C-terminally approximately to the same boundary as the minimal VEGF binding fragment of VEGFR-1. Although domain 2 of VEGFR-1 is sufficient for VEGF binding (4Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), no binding of VEGF-C occurred to VEGFR-3/IgGFc fusion proteins consisting of only domain 2 (including various lengths of the linker) or domains 2 and 3 (supplemental data). In contrast, VEGF-C bound efficiently to the second domain of VEGFR-2 consisting of residues 118-220; constructs containing an additional 6 or 12 C-terminal residues showed reduced interaction (supplemental data). Mosaic VEGFs Induce VEGFR-2 and -3 Phosphorylation—To confirm the binding data, we assayed the dimerization-induced autophosphorylation of native VEGF receptors. For the phosphorylation assay, we chose a growth factor concentration that would saturate the response to VEGF and VEGF-C but allow the detection of differences in less active molecules. The mosaic factors 12-11, 84-11, and 12-14 were almost as potent as VEGF-C in inducing the phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 (Fig. 4A). Many of the mosaic molecules, however, induced a weaker VEGFR-2 phosphorylation than VEGF or VEGF-C (Fig. 4A). The receptor phosphorylation data mirrored the receptor binding data, with the exception of molecule 12-14. This mosaic factor induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation but did not precipitate with the soluble VEGFR-2/IgGFc protein for reasons yet to be determined. As VEGFR-1 activation cannot be measured in terms of receptor phosphorylation (25Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 26Shibuya M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), we used a bioassay to demonstrate biological activity (Fig. 4B). All VEGFR-1 binding mosaic molecules were able to mediate survival of the stably transfected chimeric VEGFR-1EC/Epo receptor Ba/F3 cells, some at similar concentrations to VEGF. Mosaic molecules that were negative in the VEGFR-1 binding screen showed residual activity at very high concentrations. Mosaic VEGFs Are Angiogenic and Lymphangiogenic—To simultaneously analyze the angiogenic and lymphangiogenic potential of the mosaic molecules in vivo, the purified proteins were applied to differentiated chick CAM (Fig. 5) (21Oh S.J.

After incubation for 3 days, the blood vessels of the CAM were identified by staining for αSMA and von Willebrand factor, whereas the transcription factor Prox-1 was stained to identify the lymphatic vessels (Fig. 6A).FIGURE 6Characterization of the vasculature of the chick CAM treated with recombinant VEGF, VEGF-C and mosaic growth factors. A, in frozen serial sections, antibodies against αSMA stained all large blood vessels (red arrows). The CAM lymph vessels are devoid of smooth muscle, except for the largest collectors in the allantoic stalk (21Oh S.J. Jeltsch M.M. Birkenhager R. McCarthy J.E. Weich H.A. Christ B. Alitalo K.

To elucidate the minimum number of hemagglutinin trimers needed for fusion, the kinetics of fusion induced by reconstituted vesicles of hemagglutinin was studied by using single-vesicle image analysis. The surface density of hemagglutinin fusion-activity sites on the vesicles was varied, while keeping the surface density of receptor-binding activity sites constant, by co-reconstitution of the fusogenic form of hemagglutinin, HA1,2, and the non-fusogenic form, HA0, at various HA1,2:(HA1,2 + HA0) ratios. The rate of fusion between the hemagglutinin vesicles containing a fluorescent lipid probe, octadecylrhodamine B, and red blood cell ghost membranes was estimated from the time distribution of fusion events of single vesicles observed by fluorescence microscopy. The best fit of a log-log plot of fusion rate versus the surface density of HA1,2 exhibited a slope of 0.85, strongly supporting the hypothesis that single hemagglutinin trimers are sufficient for fusion. When only HA1,2 (without HA0) was reconstituted on vesicles, the dependence of fusion rate on the surface density of HA1,2 was distinct from that for the HA1,2-HA0 co-reconstitution.

The “initial fusion pores” mediated by HA have been recorded electrophysiologically, and the pore diameter is estimated to be 1-2 nm (6Spruce A.E. Iwata A. White J.M. Almers W.

Quick-freezing-replica electron microscopy observation of fusion between influenza virus and liposomes has directly demonstrated the HA-induced fusion sites and fusion pores of the nanometer order, and the fusion sites have been described morphologically as “micro-protrusions of lipid bilayers” (8Kanaseki T. Kawasaki K. Murata M. Ikeuchi Y. Ohnishi S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1041-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). From a comparison of the sizes of the initial fusion pores (1-2 nm) and the micro-protrusions (10-20 nm) with those of the three-dimensional structure of HA trimers (∼14 nm long and 4 nm wide (9Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar)), it would be rational to assume that a small number of HA trimers are involved at individual fusion sites, although each viral particle is covered with ∼400 HA trimer copies.

The minimum number of HA trimers needed for fusion should be determined unambiguously, because this issue is a prerequisite for clarifying the mechanism of HA-induced fusion and is also of primary importance for studies of intracellular membrane fusion.HA has receptor-binding as well as membrane-fusion activity, both of which are indispensable for viral infection of host cells. Viral particles attached to cell surfaces through binding of HA to viral receptors are endocytosed and transported to endosomes (20Martin K. Helenius A. J.

HA is a homotrimer in which each monomer consists of two disulfide-linked polypeptides, HA1 and HA2, generated by proteolytic cleavage of the primary translation product, HA0. This cleavage is an absolute requirement for low pH-induced fusion (25Maeda T. Kawasaki K. Ohnishi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26White J. Matlin K. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), although both uncleaved and cleaved forms of HA have receptor-binding activity.The aim of this study was to obtain conclusive evidence of whether HA-induced fusion occurs by a multiple-trimer or a single-trimer mechanism by the use of microscopic image analysis. The single-vesicle analysis we performed was vastly superior to the conventional fusion assay using fluorescence lipid mixing measurement for obtaining precise kinetic data on HA-induced fusion. We used two approaches to manipulate the surface density of HA. One series of experiments involved co-reconstitution of fusogenic HA1,2 trimers and non-fusogenic HA0 trimers with various HA1,2:(HA1,2 + HA0) ratios and with a constant protein/lipid ratio to assess the effect of the surface density of the fusion-activity sites of HA without changes in the surface density of the receptor-binding sites. The other series of experiments involved reconstitution of HA1,2 trimers without HA0 trimers, in which the surface densities of the fusion-activity sites and the receptor-binding sites were changed in parallel. The former series of experiments allowed us to deduce the minimum number of HA trimers required for fusion, whereas the latter series, in comparison with the former, could be used to evaluate how much HA-receptor binding interfered with fusion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Viruses, and Reagents—Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Influenza virus A/PR/8/1934(H1N1) was prepared from the supernatant of infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells at 12 h postinfection. The virus was purified by differential centrifugation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Viral protein was quantified by Lowry's method. Trypsin, benzamidine, aprotinin, Triton X-100, and cholesterol were purchased from Sigma. Soybean trypsin inhibitor was obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan), egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC) from NOF (Tokyo, Japan), and octadecylrhodamine B chloride (R18) from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Red Blood Cell Ghost Membranes—Human red blood cells (type A+) obtained from a single healthy donor were washed three times with PBS and diluted to 1% (v/v) in PBS. The red blood cells (0.2 ml) were allowed to attach to a poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslip at 4 °C for 15 min, then lysed to ghost membranes by three washes with ice-cold 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0). The ghost membranes were resealed in PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.49 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C, and kept in PIPES buffer (5 mm PIPES, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) on ice until use.Reconstituted Vesicles of HA—A/PR/8/1934 virus grown in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells contains HA as a precursor, HA0 (27Matlin K.S. Simons K. Cell. 1983; 34: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To cleave HA0, 5 μl of trypsin (10 mg/ml) was added to a virus suspension (12 mg of total viral protein in 1 ml of PIPES buffer), and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 mg/ml), 2 μl of benzamidine (62 mg/ml), and 1 μl of aprotinin (1 mg/ml) in PIPES buffer. The virus was then pelleted by centrifugation (55,000 × g for 30 min) and resuspended in PIPES buffer. HA1,2 and HA0 were purified from trypsin-treated virus and non-treated virus, respectively, by solubilization with Triton X-100 and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, as described previously (28Kawasaki K. Sato S. Ohnishi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 733: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Neuraminidase was not removed by this procedure but remained at a reduced level, as shown under “Results.”The isolated HA (1 mg in 1 ml of PIPES buffer) was resolubilized by addition of 40 μl of 20% (wt/wt) Triton X-100 and by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Triton X-100 treatment at 4 °C is often used for studies of lipid rafts to obtain detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes (29Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). The present procedure at room temperature (∼25 °C) was distinct from that at 4 °C in that HA trimers were not aggregated after Triton X-100 treatment as examined by gel-filtration chromatography (Sephacryl S-300, Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden; data not shown). A lipid mixture (2.5 mg) of egg PC/cholesterol/R18 (3.8:1.9: 1.0, by weight) in chloroform/methanol (2:1) was dried and kept under vacuum overnight. The lipid film was suspended in 0.31 ml of PIPES buffer and mixed with 0.19 ml of 20% Triton X-100. For the first series of reconstitutions (the “variable [F] experiment”), HA1,2 and HA0 samples mixed at various HA1,2:(HA1,2 + HA0) ratios were added to the lipid solution at 1.4 mg of HA per 1 mg of lipid. To remove the detergent, the mixtures were dialyzed through Spectrapor membrane tubing 2 (25 mm, Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA) against 2.0 liters of PIPES buffer containing CaCl2 and MgCl2 at 2 mm each and 3 g of Bio-beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) at room temperature for 4 h and then at 4 °C for 80 h (28Kawasaki K. Sato S. Ohnishi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 733: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Volsky D.J. Loyter S. FEBS Lett. 1978; 92: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The HA-reconstituted vesicles were purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. For the second series of reconstitutions (the “variable [F-B] experiment”), HA1,2 and lipid were mixed at various HA1,2 to lipid ratios. The vesicles were prepared in the same manner as described above.Total lipid in HA vesicles was quantified by the amount of R18 in the vesicles, based on the fact that R18 accounts for 15% of the total weight of lipids in the vesicles. The vesicles were solubilized by adding 0.1% (final concentration) Triton X-100 in PBS, and the fluorescence of R18 (excitation at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm) was measured using an aliquot of the solution with a spectrofluorometer (RF5300-PC, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), calibrated with R18 standard solutions containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The range of the HA:lipid ratio (wt/wt) was 3.2-4.5 for vesicle preparations in the variable [F] experiment, and 0.29-3.4 for those in the variable [F-B] experiment.The degree of R18 self-quenching in each HA vesicle was examined by comparison of R18 fluorescence before and after solubilization of the vesicle with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. R18 fluorescence was quenched to an almost equal extent independently of the vesicle composition, i.e. to a range of 3.3-3.7% in the HA vesicles of the variable [F] experiment and to a range of 3.0-4.3% in those of the variable [F-B] experiment.The HA1,2:(HA1,2 + HA0) ratio reconstituted on the vesicles in the variable [F] experiment was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis. The profiles of silver-stained gels of each vesicle preparation were digitized (Pictrography 3000, Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan) and were quantified with National Institutes of Health Image 1.61 software. It should be noted that the vesicles prepared with the non-trypsinized HA sample only contained a trace amount (∼2%) of HA1,2.Electron Microscopy—A droplet of HA vesicle sample was put on a 400-mesh copper grid (Veco, Eiersbeck, Netherlands) coated with collodion and then negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Transmission electron microscopic images were obtained using a model H-7000 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 75 kV.Image Analysis of Fusion Events of Single Vesicles—HA vesicles in 0.1 ml of PIPES buffer (0.05-0.15 μg of lipid/ml) were added to ghost membranes on coverslips mounted in a metal chamber (31Mizuno T. Kawasaki K. Miyamoto H. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After 5 min at 20 °C, unbound vesicles were removed by three washes with PIPES buffer, and the chamber was mounted on a laser scanning microscope (LSM 410, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a Planapochromat 63/1.4 numerical aperture objective. Capture of time-lapse sequences of the fluorescence images at 1.5-s intervals was started, and then to trigger fusion activity of HA, the PIPES buffer was replaced with 0.5 ml of an acidic buffer (145 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.2). Fluorescence of R18 upon excitation with a 543 nm HeNe laser was imaged by using a 590 nm cut-off filter.To monitor the fluorescence intensities of individual fusing membranes, two kinds of regions of interest were drawn (see Fig. 2, B and H): 1) outlines of punctate fluorescence from HA vesicles, and 2) roughly circular regions, enclosing the periphery of fluorescence redistributed to ghost membranes, as judged from the final fluorescence images of the time-lapse sequences. The changes in fluorescence intensity at individual regions were measured with National Institutes of Health Image 1.61 software. The response times before fusion of single vesicles were determined by the timing of fluorescence flashes at more than 300 vesicle regions for each vesicle preparation. Kinetics of vesicle fusion was obtained from the cumulative sums of the response time distributions. The fusion rate, V, was calculated in each case from the tangent drawn to the straight line of the time-dependence curve of vesicle fusion and used for log-log plot analysis.Reconstitution of HA into lipid vesicles by detergent dialysis often leads to fractions of protein/detergent/lipid micelles, “HA rosettes” (28Kawasaki K. Sato S. Ohnishi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 733: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the maximum level in the ratio of cholesterol to egg PC (cholesterol/egg PC = 1:2 by weight) used for reconstitution was effective to reduce the formation of HA rosettes, 3K. Kawasaki, unpublished result. minor fractions of HA rosettes were still possible. HA rosettes, however, were not included in the fluorescence flash analysis, because HA rosettes could not be discerned as bright punctate fluorescence under the microscope due to the size much smaller than that of HA vesicles. The results described below on fusion activity were attributable only to HA vesicles with intense fluorescence but not to HA rosettes.RESULTSResponse Time before Fusion Events of Individual HA Reconstituted Vesicles—Morphology of the HA1,2-reconstituted vesicles was examined by negative staining electron microscopy (Fig. 1). The surfaces of vesicles were covered with spike structures, consistent with the well known characteristic morphology of HA trimers.FIGURE 1A representative image of HA vesicle observed by negative-staining electron microscopy. HA1,2 vesicle with protein to lipid ratio of 3.4:1 (wt/wt) negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate was observed under an electron microscope. Spike structures of HA trimers were distributed on the lipid vesicle. Bar = 50 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As a first step in kinetic analysis of fusion by single-vesicle imaging, fluorescence microscopic images during fusion between the HA1,2-reconstituted vesicles and ghost membranes were examined. Individual vesicles were discerned as punctate fluorescence at pH 7.5, whereas the ghost membranes bound to the vesicles were invisible (Fig. 2A). Low pH treatment induced diffusion of R18 from the HA vesicles to the ghost membranes (Fig. 2, B-H), which agreed well with R18 redistribution due to membrane fusion (32Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar).To precisely examine the time course of fusion events at single HA vesicles, the time-lapse sequences of images of HA vesicle-ghost conjugates, such as those shown in Fig. 2, B-H, were analyzed quantitatively. Fluorescence intensities were measured in the region of the HA vesicle, in the region of the ghost membrane fusing with the vesicle, and in the area including both of them (Fig. 2I). The low pH treatment to induce fusion did not cause any instantaneous changes in the fluorescence intensity in any of the regions. After several seconds, however, an abrupt increase in fluorescence (fluorescence flash) and a subsequent decrease were observed in the vesicle region. We defined the interval between the low pH treatment and the fluorescence flash as the response time. The increase was ascribed to fluorescence dequenching of R18 due to lipid mixing between the vesicle and the ghost membrane upon fusion, similar to the previously observed increase in fluorescence of R18-labeled influenza virus fusing with ghost membranes (33Georgiou G.N. Morrison I.E. Cherry R.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Lowy R.J. Sarkar D.P. Chen Y. Blumenthal R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1850-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The decrease, on the other hand, was attributable to lateral diffusion of R18 from the vesicle region out to the ghost region, consistent with the simultaneous appearance of fluorescence in the ghost region. As the sum of these changes in the vesicle and ghost regions, the fluorescence intensity in the total area increased in a simple saturating manner with response time. Fluorescence flashes at HA vesicles were not observed at neutral pH (see the next section).Among several aspects of the changes in the fluorescence images of fusing membranes described above, we hereafter examined only the response time between the low pH trigger and the fluorescence flash at a single vesicle, rather than the later phases of the changes in fluorescence, to discriminate the initial fusion events from the following lipid redistribution steps. Thus, we defined the onset of the fluorescence flash, i.e. the onset of lipid mixing at a single vesicle, as the onset of single-vesicle fusion. The response times before the fluorescence flashes were determined at hundreds of HA vesicles for each preparation, and used for the following kinetic analysis.Variable [F] Experiment: Fusion Rates of HA Vesicles with Varying Surface Density of HA1,2 but with a Constant Surface Density of Total HA—For the first series of reconstitutions, we prepared co-reconstituted vesicles of HA1,2 and HA0 at various HA1,2:(HA1,2 + HA0) ratios (from 0.02 to 1.0) and at a constant ratio of total HA to lipid (within the range 3.2:1 to 4.5:1 by weight). HA1,2:(HA1,2 + HA0) ratios reconstituted in each vesicle preparation was quantitatively examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Because HA1,2 is fusogenic and HA0 is non-fusogenic, the surface density of fusion-activity sites of HA on the vesicle membranes should be proportional to the HA1,2 content. On the other hand, the surface density of receptor-binding sites of HA on the membranes should be constant, because both HA1,2 and HA0 have equal receptor-binding activities. The three-dimensional structures of HA1,2 and HA0 differ only at the proteolytic cleavage site; the other residues, including the receptor-binding pockets, are essentially superimposable (35Chen J. Lee K.H. Steinhauer D.A. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 409-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). We refer to this series of HA1,2-HA0 co-reconstitutions as the “variable [F] experiment” (Fig. 4, top).FIGURE 3SDS-PAGE of co-reconstituted vesicles of HA0 and HA1,2. HA1,2:(HA1,2 + HA0) ratios in each reconstituted vesicle sample of the variable [F] experiment was quantified by SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis. HA1,2:(HA1,2 + HA0) ratios were 100% (lane a), 61% (lane b), 37% (lane c), 22% (lane d), 11% (lane e), 8% (lane f), and 2% (lane g), which correspond to HA1,2 to lipid ratios (wt/wt) of 3.4:1, 1.9:1, 1.2:1, 0.75:1, 0.46:1, 0.31:1, and 0.099:1, respectively.

For the vesicle preparation with 100% HA1,2 (Fig. 5A, panel a), the vesicle fusion was the most synchronized and the frequency of fusion at the peak level was the highest among the samples tested. On the other hand, the histograms broadened as the HA1,2 content in the vesicles was reduced (Fig. 5A, panels b-g). Cumulative sums of the distributions of the response times in Fig. 5A gave the kinetics of vesicle fusion (Fig. 5B). In the samples with 61 and 100% HA1,2, fusion events were observed with >90% of the vesicles, demonstrating that the functional reconstitution of HA on lipid vesicles was highly successful. The efficient fusion was not due to the relatively high concentration of R18 in the vesicles, because the fusion kinetics was independent of R18 concentration within the range 2-15% (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S1). The optimal value of fusion efficiency of HA vesicles and ghost membranes (>90%) was >60 times higher than that of HA-expressing cells and liposomes (<1.56% (12Ellens H. Bentz J. Mason D. Zhang F. White J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9697-9707Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar)), indicating the remarkable suitability of HA reconstitution for the quantitative analysis of HA-induced fusion.FIGURE 5Kinetic analysis of vesicle fusion in the variable [F] experiment. A, response time distributions of single-vesicle fusion. The co-reconstituted vesicles with various HA1,2:(HA1,2 + HA0) ratios were pre-bound with ghost membranes and treated at pH 5.2 and 20 °C, and fluorescence intensities at individual vesicles were measured as in Fig. 2I to determine the response times for vesicle fusion (panels a-g). HA1,2 to lipid ratios (wt/wt) were determined as in Fig. 3. Fusion (fluorescence flash) of HA1,2 vesicles (HA1,2 to lipid ratio of 3.4:1) with ghost membranes was not observed at pH 7.5 (h). “n” in each box denotes the number of HA vesicles examined, with parenthesized number of fused vesicles/number of non-fused vesicles within 90 s.

D, a log-log plot of the fusion rate versus surface density of HA1,2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It should be borne in mind that the increase in R18 fluorescence can sometimes be induced by lipid exchange between closely apposed membranes, as well as by fusion of the membranes (36Ohki S. Flanagan D. Hoekstra D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7496-7503Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), fluorescence flashes were not recorded with HA1,2 vesicles bound to ghost membranes at pH 7.5, indicating that the single-vesicle image analysis was not affected by possible R18 exchange without fusion. Under certain conditions of fusion, lipid mixing can proceed without any mixing of the aqueous content, a phenomenon known as “hemifusion,” i.e. fusion that occurs only at the outer leaflets of lipid bilayers and not at the inner leaflets (37Markosyan R.M. Cohen F.S. Melikyan G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Using single-vesicle analysis, we therefore examined whether or not vesicle-ghost fusion terminated at a hemifusion state.

Phosphatases including Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases (SHPs), are well known as negative regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway, but their precise mechanisms are largely unknown. Based on our previous finding that in cultured rat brain microglia, gangliosides induce rapid and transient activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, we hypothesized that raft-mediated SHP-2 activation is involved in transient activation of JAK-STAT signaling by gangliosides. We first used Western blot analysis to confirm that gangliosides rapidly induce the phosphorylation of SHP-2. This was inhibited by pretreatment with the lipid raft disrupter filipin and was restored following filipin removal. Immunostaining using antibodies directed against p-SHP-2 and flotillin-1 revealed ganglioside-induced clustering and polarization of p-SHP-2 in membrane rafts. Raft-associated regulation of SHP-2 was further demonstrated in fractionation experiments using detergent and detergent-free sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Rapid SHP-2 recruitment to detergent-insoluble raft fractions by gangliosides was inhibited by filipin, further indicating the involvement of rafts. We also confirmed by immunoprecipitation that SHP-2 rapidly binds in a raft-dependent manner to JAK2 in response to gangliosides.

The positive regulation of MAP kinase is achieved through dephosphorylation of the RasGap-binding site on the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, association with other adaptor molecules, or inactivation of inhibitory molecules, all of which eventually lead to Ras-Raf-MAP kinase activation. SHP-2 exerts its negative regulatory effects via direct dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules such as JAKs and STATs, which must occur through direct targeting of SHP-2 to tyrosine-phosphorylated or otherwise modified signaling molecules.

Therefore, lipid raft-mediated regulation of SHP-2 is an essential component of many cellular signaling pathways.

Raft domains contain several types of signaling molecules, including receptor tyrosine kinases, the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and G proteins, as well as structural proteins such as members of the caveolin and flotillin families. Microglia activation, which induces initial neuroinflammation in several neurodegenerative diseases (15Benveniste E.N. J. Mol.

The mechanisms involved in microglia activation and strategies for suppressing it have been vigorously studied (16Liu B. Hong J.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 23Park E.J. Park S.Y. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Biol.

We previously reported that a JAK-STAT-mediated inflammatory signal is activated by gangliosides, lipopolysaccharide, and interferon-γ in microglia, with the signal activated by gangliosides being particularly rapid and transient (21Kim O.S. Park E.J. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40594-40601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Kim H.Y. Park E.J. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6072-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We also reported that an activated JAK-STAT signal is inhibited by curcumin or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonists through interaction of JAK1/2 with SHP-2 (23Park E.J. Park S.Y. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14747-14752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 26Kim H.Y. Park E.J. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6072-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms through which SHP-2 is regulated in microglial inflammatory responses and is associated with JAKs remain largely unknown. Based on our previous results, we propose that raft-associated SHP-2 recruitment and activation may be involved in the rapid and transient activation of the JAK-STAT pathway by gangliosides. In this study, we take advantage of the biochemical characteristics of membrane rafts to demonstrate that SHP-2 phosphorylation and targeting are induced by gangliosides, suppressed by filipin, a disrupter of membrane rafts, and restored upon filipin removal. Using double immunostaining with antibodies against p-SHP-2 and the raft marker flotillin-1, we further demonstrate that p-SHP-2 is recruited to the membrane raft by gangliosides. In addition, we use immunoprecipitation to show that the interaction between SHP-2 and JAK2 is also inhibited by filipin and restored when filipin is removed. Together, these results indicate that SHP-2 phosphorylation and targeting as well as its interaction with JAK2 occur in a raft-dependent manner. Reagents—Gangliosides mixture (Gmix) was purchased from Matraya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Antibodies against p-SHP-2 (Y580) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverley, MA). Antibodies against JAK2 were purchased from UBI (Lake Placid, NY), and antibodies against actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Technology (Santa Cruz, CA). SHP-2 and flotilin-1 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Cholera toxin B (GM1), horseradish peroxidase (conjugated), and Filipin complex were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—Primary microglia were cultured from the cerebral cortices of 1-3-day old Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (21Kim O.S. Park E.J. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40594-40601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Kim H.Y. Park E.J. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6072-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cortices were triturated into single cells in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and plated in 75-cm2 T-flasks (0.5 hemisphere/flask) for 2-3 weeks. Microglia were then detached from the flasks by mild shaking and filtered through a nylon mesh to remove astrocytes. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes (8 × 105 cells/dish) or 100-mm dishes (2 × 106 cells/dish). After 60 min, the cells were washed to remove unattached cells before being used in experiments. BV2-immortalized murine microglial cells were obtained from Dr. E. J. Choi (Korea University). The BV2 cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum. All cells were serum-starved overnight before being used for experiments. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4) containing protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm EDTA). The lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was then collected. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell BioScience). The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), and then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system. Isolation of Detergent-insoluble Fraction—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with HEPES buffer (10 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. These supernatants were used as the soluble fraction in experiments. The pellets were washed with 1 ml of cold HEPES buffer without detergent, solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. These supernatants were used as the insoluble fraction in experiments. Each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting. Detergent-free, Discontinuous Sucrose Gradient Ultracentrifugation— To isolate the low-density membrane rafts, discontinuous sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was performed (27Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 0.5 m sodium carbonate (pH 11.0). Homogenization was then performed using a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer (about 40 strokes). The homogenate was then adjusted to 40% sucrose by addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5-35% discontinuous sucrose gradient (4 ml of 5% sucrose; 4 ml of 35% sucrose; both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) was formed above the sample and centrifuged at 190,000 × g for 20 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). From the top of each gradient, 1-ml fractions were collected for a total of 12 fractions. Gradient fractions were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blotted and incubated with anti-SHP-2 antibody. Immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts were prepared using modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm NaVO4). Lysates weighing 300-500 μg were incubated with 1-2 μg of SHP-2 antibody at 4 °C overnight and precipitated with protein G-agarose beads (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) for 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was then performed with several antibodies as indicated in the text and figure legends. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—To determine p-SHP-2 and flotilin-1 localization, cells cultured on poly-d-lysin-coated coverslips were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 100% methanol at -20 °C. The fixed cells were then washed with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) and blotted with 10% serum for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h, and then mounted and observed under a confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany). The Measurement of Band Density and Statistical Analysis—The band density of Western blotting was measured by Image Gauge version 4.0 program (FUJI Photo Film Co., Ltd). The graphs were expressed as mean ± S.E. They were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc comparisons (Student-Newman-Keuls) using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). SHP-2 Phosphorylation Is Rapidly Induced by Gmix in Rat Primary Microglia and BV2 Murine Microglial Cell Lines—Based on our previous observations that JAK-STAT activation occurs within 5-15 min of Gmix addition and then dissipates after 30 min in cultured rat brain microglia (21Kim O.S. Park E.J. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40594-40601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Kim H.Y. Park E.J. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6072-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether this transient activation is due to the suppression of JAKs by SHP-2. We first assessed SHP-2 phosphorylation using Western blot analysis, because SHP-2 phosphatase activity is regulated by the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine residues Tyr-542 and Tyr-580 (28Lu W. Gong D. Bar-Sagi D. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Primary microglia or BV2 murine microglial cells were stimulated with 50 μg/ml Gmix for the times indicated in Fig. 1. The cells were then harvested and cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using an antibody directed against SHP-2 phosphorylated at Tyr-580. SHP-2 was rapidly phosphorylated by 5 min, but this dissipated after 30 min in both Gmix-treated primary microglia (Fig. 1A) and BV2 microglial cells (Fig. 1B). SHP-2 Phosphorylation by Gmix Is Mediated via Lipid Rafts—Because SHP-2 activation is known to be linked to its raft translocation, we measured raft involvement by pretreating cells with filipin, a cholesterol-binding polyene macrolide that disrupts lipid rafts by dispersing cholesterol, a major raft component. Cells were pretreated with 5 μg/ml filipin for 15 min, washed with serum-free media, and then treated with 50 μg/ml Gmix. Filipin treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of SHP-2 induced by Gmix in both rat primary microglia (Fig. 2A) and BV2 microglial cells (Fig. 2B). Lipid rafts are known to reform after filipin removal through reincorporation of cholesterol (29Bolard J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 257-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 30Robinson J.M. Karnovsky M.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1980; 28: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31McGookey D.J. Fagerberg K. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm the regulation of SHP-2 through lipid rafts, we measured SHP-2 phosphorylation after allowing sufficient time for lipid raft reconstruction. Two hours after filipin removal, addition of 50 μg/ml Gmix restored the phosphorylation of SHP-2 in BV2 microglial cells (Fig. 2B). Therefore, it appears that Gmix-regulated SHP-2 phosphorylation is mediated by lipid rafts. Clustering and Polarization of p-SHP-2 in Membrane Rafts Are Induced by Gmix—Lipid rafts are reorganized and polarized by recruitment of signaling molecules and are coalesced into larger domains. To investigate whether reconstitution of lipid rafts is induced by Gmix and whether p-SHP-2 is present in these rafts, we examined the localization of flotillin-1 and p-SHP-2 using immunocytochemistry visualized with confocal microscopy. Cells treated with or without 50 μg/ml Gmix were incubated with antibodies against the raft marker flotillin-1 and p-SHP-2. The double-stained cells were then observed under a confocal microscope. Immunofluorescence patterns of flotillin-1 and p-SHP-2 were diffusely distributed in the control primary microglia (Fig. 3A, a and b) and BV2 cells (Fig. 3B, a and b). Treatment with 50 μg/ml Gmix for 5 min induced clustering and polarization of flotillin-1 and p-SHP-2 in rat primary microglia (Fig. 3A, d and e) and BV2 microglial cells (Fig. 3B, d and e). The merged images revealed that flotillin-1 and p-SHP-2 are colocalized in Gmix-treated primary microglia (Fig. 3A, f) and BV2 cells (Fig. 3B, f). These results indicate that in Gmix-treated microglia, lipid rafts are reformed and p-SHP-2 is localized at lipid raft. SHP-2 Is Recruited to Detergent-insoluble Fractions by Gmix—Because lipid rafts are easily isolated by their insolubility in non-ionic detergents at 4 °C, they are also called detergent-resistant microdomains. Whereas many signaling proteins are permanently associated with lipid rafts, some are only temporally associated with rafts via biochemical or biological modifications. SHP-2 is primarily present in the cytosol and is recruited to its target molecules in lipid rafts. Because we observed p-SHP-2 localization at the lipid raft in Fig. 3, we investigated whether SHP-2 is recruited to lipid rafts by Gmix using detergent-insoluble fractionation by the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100. Primary microglia or BV2 microglial cells were treated with 50 μg/ml Gmix for the times indicated in Fig. 4, and cell lysates were then fractionated into insoluble and soluble fractions using 0.5% Triton X-100. These separated fractions were then subjected to Western blot analysis. SHP-2 appeared to be translocated to the detergent-insoluble fraction at 5 min after Gmix treatment in rat primary microglia (Fig. 4A). Similarly, in BV2 microglial cells, Gmix increased the recruitment of SHP-2 to the detergent-insoluble fraction quickly (Fig. 4B). Immunoblotting with flotillin-1 confirmed the presence of lipid rafts in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Flotillin-1 was also used as loading control for the detergent-insoluble fractions. p-SHP-2 in the detergent-insoluble fraction was hardly detected under our experimental conditions. This is probably either because of a lack of a sufficient amount of cell lysates or a methodological problem. SHP-2 Is Recruited by Gmix to the Low-density Fraction during Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—In addition to detergent-insoluble fractions, lipid rafts are known to be present in the low-buoyant density of sucrose gradients; therefore, we determined whether SHP-2 is also targeted into the low-density fraction by Gmix. Detergent-free sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” BV2 microglial cells were homogenized in detergent-free buffer, subjected to sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and divided into 12 fractions each containing 1 ml. Lipid rafts were detected by Western blot analysis with horseradish peroxidase-linked cholera toxin B, which binds to GM1, a major component of lipid rafts. GM1 was primarily detected in fractions 4 and 5 in BV2 microglial cells, indicating that these fractions contained lipid rafts (Fig. 5A). SHP-2 was detected in the GM1-positive fractions, and Gmix induced rapid association of SHP-2 to the raft region of GM1-positive fractions at 5 min (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C shows the ratio of the band density of lipid raft-associated SHP-2 (fractions 4 and 5) over total SHP-2. Results of Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that SHP-2 was practically recruited to lipid raft by Gmix. SHP-2 Translocation to Detergent-insoluble Fractions Is Suppressed by Filipin and Restored upon Filipin Removal—To confirm that the recruitment of SHP-2 is suppressed by disassembly of lipid rafts, we examined the effect of filipin on the translocation of SHP-2 to the detergent-insoluble fraction. As described in the legend to Fig. 2, cells were incubated with filipin for 15 min to allow for disruption of the lipid raft and subsequently incubated in fresh media for 2 h to allow raft reassembly. Cells were separated into insoluble and soluble fractions using Triton X-100 and analyzed by Western blotting. Pretreatment with 5 μg/ml filipin for 15 min suppressed recruitment of SHP-2 by Gmix in rat primary microglia (Fig. 6A) and BV2 microglial cells (Fig. 6B). Two hours after filipin removal, Gmix-induced SHP-2 recruitment was restored, further confirming that SHP-2 targeting is regulated by lipid rafts. JAK2 Is Recruited to Detergent-insoluble Fractions by Gmix—The above results indicate that SHP-2 is targeted to and phosphorylated in lipid rafts, suggesting that this is where regulation of SHP-2 occurs. We therefore decided to search for an SHP-2 target molecule, JAK2, in the membrane raft using detergent-resistant fractionation. To examine whether the translocation of JAK2 to lipid rafts is induced by Gmix, primary microglia (Fig. 7A, a) or BV2 microglial cells (Fig. 7B, a) were treated with 50 μg/ml Gmix for the times indicated. The cells were then lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100-containing HEPES buffer and centrifugation was performed to isolate the soluble and insoluble fractions. Each sample was then subjected to Western blot analysis. Gmix-induced recruitment of p-JAK2 and JAK2 to the insoluble fraction occurred by 5 min, but, p-JAK was not detected in soluble fractions (Fig. 7, A, a and B, a). The recruitment of JAK2 into the rafts was also inhibited by filipin in primary microglia and BV2 cells (Fig. 7, A, b and B, b, respectively) and restored following filipin removal in primary microglia. These results indicate that, like SHP-2, p-JAK2 and JAK2 are regulated through lipid rafts. SHP-2 Targeting to JAK2 Is Regulated by Lipid Rafts—SHP-2, which is known to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues, binds JAKs and negatively regulates the JAK-STAT pathway. To demonstrate that SHP-2 interacts with and inhibits JAK2, we performed immunoprecipitation using an antibody directed against SHP-2. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-2 and subjected to Western blotting with anti-JAK2. In BV2 microglial cells, Gmix increased the association of SHP-2 with JAK2 within 5 min, whereas control levels were restored after 30 min (Fig. 8A). Pretreatment of filipin suppressed the increased binding of SHP-2 with JAK2 by Gmix, and binding was restored following filipin removal in both rat primary microglia (Fig. 8B, a) and BV2 microglial cells (Fig. 8B, b), confirming that SHP-2 association with JAK2 is regulated by lipid rafts. Finally, we tested whether SHP-2 and JAK2 are associated in the detergent-insoluble fractions. BV2 microglial cells were treated with 50 μg/ml Gmix. At the indicated times cells were lysed and separated into detergent-insoluble and -soluble fractions. SHP-2 was isolated from each fraction by immunoprecipitation, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibody against JAK2 or SHP-2. Although treatment with Gmix for 5 min increased the association of SHP-2 and JAK2 in the insoluble fraction, there was no change in the soluble fraction (Fig. 8C, and data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that Gmix promotes SHP-2 recruitment to the insoluble fraction and its association with JAK2 in lipid rafts in microglia. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the transient activation of the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway in ganglioside-stimulated microglia is because of the phosphorylation and lipid raft-mediated association of SHP-2 with JAK-2, suggesting a potential mechanism for the regulation of SHP-2 in activated microglia. JAKs and STATs are traditionally considered interferon signaling molecules, but recent reports suggest that they are also involved in signaling triggered by other cytokines and growth factors and may thus mediate a variety of cellular functions including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation (32Kisseleva T. Bhattacharya S. Braunstein J. Schindler C.W. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 285: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 33Shuai K. Liu B. Nat. Rev.

Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). JAK-STAT signaling is tightly regulated by induction of inhibitory molecules such as SOCS family proteins, activation of phosphatases, and degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathways (35Cooney R.N. Shock. 2002; 17: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 36Kile B.T. Alexander W.S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 37Wormald S. Hilton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The rapid and transient activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway by gangliosides prompted us to consider regulation by proteintyrosine phosphatases such as SHPs, particularly because we have previously shown that JAK-STAT signals are negatively regulated by SHP-2 (23Park E.J. Park S.Y. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14747-14752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 26Kim H.Y. Park E.J. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6072-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We have shown that SHP-2 phosphorylation is rapidly induced from 5 to 15 min in ganglioside-stimulated microglia. SHPs are autoinhibited in their resting state by an intramolecular interaction between their SH2 domains and their protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain is activated following its association with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including membrane receptors and JAKs (38Fuhrer D.K. Feng G.S. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24826-24830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently, Lu et al. (28Lu W. Gong D. Bar-Sagi D. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the two C-terminal tyrosine residues (Tyr-542 and Tyr-580) are also involved in SHP-2 activation by intramolecularly interacting with SH2 domains. However, the precise mechanisms through which SHP-2 comes in contact with phosphotyrosine residues and dephosphorylates its target molecules remain to be clarified. Although SHP-2 is a cytosolic protein, it is involved in the dephosphorylation of many membrane proteins. Therefore, SHP-2 must be somehow recruited to the membrane via an adapter protein or conformational changes. The necessity of membrane recruitment suggests the possible participation of lipid rafts. SHP-2 targeting to lipid rafts following cell attachment has been shown to influence cell adhesion and migration by regulating Rho activity (8Lacalle R.A. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Jimenez-Baranda S. Martinez A. Manes S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, SHP-2 has been reported to be recruited to the low-density membrane fractions in confluent endothelial cells via its interaction with annexin II in a cholesterol-dependent manner (39Burkart A. Samii B. Corvera S. Shpetner H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18360-18367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that disruption of lipid rafts by filipin inhibits phosphorylation of SHP-2. In addition, SHP-2 is rapidly recruited to the detergent-insoluble, low-density fraction obtained during detergent-free sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation following incubation with Gmix, and this recruitment is inhibited by disrupting the lipid rafts with filipin. Immunocytochemical experiments using phospho-SHP-2 and flotillin-1 antibodies further revealed the induction of raft clustering by Gmix and that phospho-SHP-2 and flotillin-1 colocalized following incubation of cells with Gmix. The present results reveal that although little SHP-2 is translocated into lipid rafts compared with that not in lipid rafts, it is sufficient to account for the Gmix-induced, lipid-raft-mediated changes in phosphorylation. Our results are in agreement with a previous report that a small but significant amount of SHP-2 is present in lipid rafts following T cell stimulation and that purified SHP-2 blocks protein tyrosine phosphorylation in T cell membranes (40Su M.W. Yu C.L. Burakoff S.J. Jin Y.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3975-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). SHP-2 is known to be involved in many cellular signaling pathways in both catalytic-dependent or -independent manners. This protein modulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and MAP kinase in catalytic-dependent ways. Specifically, SHP-2 positively regulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation (41Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 42Wang Q. Downey G.P. Herrera-Abreu M.T. Kapus A. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol.

Yu W.M. Bunting K.D. Qu C.K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3659-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although SHP-2 is generally known to act in a catalytically dependent manner, it has also been reported to have catalytically independent activity. Yu et al. (45Yu W.M. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Qu C.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5995-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) reported that catalytically inactive SHP-2 does not affect phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation but rather reduces JAK and ERK pathway signaling induced by interleukin-3, although all three signaling molecules are altered in SHP-/- hematopoietic cells, indicating that SHP-2 regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in a catalytically independent manner. Also, SHP-2 acts as an adaptor molecule downstream of the prolactin receptor and is required for recruitment of its substrate (46Minoo P. Chughtai N. Campiglio M. Stein-Gerlach M. Lebrun J.J. Ullrich A. Ali S. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Components of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade have previously been reported to be target molecules of SHP-2. SHP-2-/- mutant mice display increased interferon-induced STAT1 activation, suggesting that SHP-2 negatively regulates the JAK-STAT pathway. SHP-2 is also known to be required as an adaptor molecule for JAK2 association with its receptor (47Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, SHP-2 acts as a dual-specificity phosphatase during the dephosphorylation of STAT1 on tyrosine and serine residues (48Wu T.R. Hong Y.K. Wang X.D. Ling M.Y. Dragoi A.M. Chung A.S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47572-47580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and direct associations between SHP-2 and JAKs have been reported (38Fuhrer D.K. Feng G.S. Yang Y.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, our previous studies showed that SHP-2 interacts with JAK and is an important inhibitory molecule of the JAK-STAT pathway. In this study, we demonstrated that SHP-2 interacts specifically with JAK2 and that this interaction is inhibited by filipin. These results suggest that rapid phosphorylation of SHP-2 by Gmix causes the JAK-STAT signal to subside in a raft-dependent manner. Although the present results did not directly show that SHP-2 regulates transient JAK-STAT activation, a recent report that transient activation of STAT1 by oncostatin M was sustained by a mutant gp130 receptor that does not bind SHP-2 (50Mahboubi K. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) is consistent with our findings. We did not detect p-SHP-2 in the detergent-insoluble fraction by Western blot analysis. Fawcett and Lorenz (51Fawcett V.C. Lorenz U. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2849-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) recently reported that SHP-1 in the lipid rafts is not detected by a monoclonal antibody against the C terminus of SHP-1 but that it is detected by polyclonal antibodies against SHP-1. This suggests that the C terminus of SHP-1 possesses a novel modification that targets it to lipid rafts (51Fawcett V.C. Lorenz U. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2849-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because SHP-2 and SHP-1 have similar structures and mechanisms of regulation, we suspect that SHP-2 also has a modification that targets it to lipid rafts. The study of biochemically isolated lipid rafts helps clarify pathways for rapid and accurate signaling. However, their significance and existence in vivo are controversial due to a lack of direct evidence (52Munro S. Cell. 2003; 115: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 53Skwarek M. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. (Warsz.). 2004; 52: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have been carried out in living cells using refined techniques such as fluorescence energy transfer in an attempt to determine their relevance. Friedrichson and Kurzchalia (54Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) used chemical cross-linking to demonstrate that lipid raft exist at the surface of living cells (54Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Recently, however, Glebov and Nichols (55Glebov O.O. Nichols B.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) used fluorescence energy transfer to show that there is no detectable clustering or overall enrichment of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins or cholera toxin B binding sites in activated T cells. Despite numerous attempts to confirm the presence of lipid rafts, their nature and existence are still controversial. Nonetheless, the characteristics and specific changes of proteins within biochemically isolated lipid rafts suggest they are sites where signaling molecules are concentrated and redistributed according to various stimuli. Taken together, our results demonstrate that transient activation of the JAK-STAT pathway by Gmix is regulated by SHP-2 activation and that its association with JAK2 occurs in a raft-dependent manner, thus describing a novel role for SHP-2 targeting to lipid rafts during microglial activation. Because microglial activation plays important roles in several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson disease, stroke, and Alzheimer disease, raft-mediated control mechanisms of JAK-STAT inflammatory signaling involved in microglial activation could be a useful therapeutic target to combat neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1995755728,"Transgenic mice expressing IGFBP-5 in the mammary gland exhibit increased cell death and plasmin generation. Because IGFBP-5 has been reported to bind to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), we determined the effects of this interaction in HC11 cells. PAI-1 prevented plasmin generation from plasminogen and inhibited cleavage of focal adhesions, expression of caspase 3, and cell death. IGFBP-5 could in turn prevent the effects of PAI-1. IGFBP-5 mutants with reduced affinity for IGF-I (N-term) or deficient in heparin binding (HEP– and C-term E and F) were also effective. This was surprising because IGFBP-5 reportedly interacts with PAI-1 via its heparin-binding domain. Biosensor analysis confirmed that, although wild-type IGFBP-5 and N-term both bound to PAI-1, the C-term E had greatly decreased interaction with PAI-1. This suggests that IGFBP-5 does not antagonize the actions of PAI-1 by a direct molecular interaction. In a cell-free system, using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) to activate plasminogen, PAI-1 inhibited plasmin generation induced by both activators, whereas IGFBP-5 prevented the effects of PAI-1 on tPA but not uPA. Furthermore, we noted that IGFBP-5 activated plasminogen to a greater extent than could be explained solely by inhibition of PAI-1, suggesting that IGFBP-5 could directly activate tPA. Indeed, IGFBP-5 and the C-term E and F were all able to enhance the activity of tPA but not uPA. These data demonstrate that IGFBP-5 can enhance the activity of tPA and that this can result in cell death induced by cleavage of focal adhesions. Thus IGFBP-5 can induce cell death by both sequestering IGF-I and enhancing plasmin generation. Transgenic mice expressing IGFBP-5 in the mammary gland exhibit increased cell death and plasmin generation.

These data demonstrate that IGFBP-5 can enhance the activity of tPA and that this can result in cell death induced by cleavage of focal adhesions. Thus IGFBP-5 can induce cell death by both sequestering IGF-I and enhancing plasmin generation. We have shown previously a large increase in the concentration of IGFBP-5 protein in the milk of rats after 48 h of mammary involution induced by removal of the suckling young, and we propose that this acts to inhibit IGF-I interaction with its receptor on the epithelial cells, resulting in cell death (1Tonner E. Barber M.C. Travers M.T. Logan A. Flint D.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5101-5107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We subsequently showed this to be the case in three independent studies, involving transgenic animals expressing IGFBP-5 in the mammary gland (2Tonner E. Barber M.C. Allan G.J. Beattie J. Webster J. Whitelaw C.B. Flint D.J. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 4547-4557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as exogenous treatment with IGFBP-5 both in vivo (3Allan G.J. Tonner E. Barber M.C. Travers M.T. Shand J.H. Vernon R.G. Kelly P.A. Binart N. Flint D.J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4310-4319Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and in vitro (4Marshman E. Green K.A. Flint D.J. White A. Streuli C.H. Westwood M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). More recently we have shown that IGFBP-5 mRNA levels are also significantly increased during involution in the mouse mammary gland (5Boutinaud M. Shand J.H. Park M.A. Phillips K. Beattie J. Flint D.J. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Changes consistent with a role for IGFBP-5 as an inhibitor of IGF-I-mediated cell survival were evident, because phosphorylation of the type I IGF 3The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, IGF-binding protein; WT, wild type; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; EACA, ϵ-amino caproic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; pNA, p-nitroanilide; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; VLL-pNA, H-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 3The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, IGF-binding protein; WT, wild type; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; EACA, ϵ-amino caproic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; pNA, p-nitroanilide; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; VLL-pNA, H-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide; GST, glutathione S-transferase. receptor and a downstream signaling molecule Akt were both decreased in IGFBP-5 transgenic mice. Furthermore, these mice exhibited decreased concentrations of two pro-survival molecules, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and increased activity of caspase-3. Most intriguingly, these mice also exhibited increased concentrations of plasmin in their mammary glands. The remodeling of the mammary gland, which occurs at the end of lactation, involves an initial phase in which there are dramatic increases in the rates of apoptosis and a second phase involving extracellular proteases, including the plasminogen system and matrix metalloproteinases, which are involved in degrading the extracellular matrix in the later stages of tissue remodeling (6Lund L.R. Romer J. Thomasset N. Solberg H. Pyke C. Bissell M.J. Dano K. Werb Z. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 181-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 has been reported to bind to PAI-1 and therefore to influence IGF-mediated cell responses (7Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2972-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that the effects of IGFBP-3 and -5 can be both IGF-dependent and IGF-independent and that interactions with particular extracellular matrix components might influence these responses (8Perks C.M. McCaig C. Clarke J.B. Clemmons D.R. Holly J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Perks C.M. McCaig C. Clarke J.B. Clemmons D.R. Holly J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These observations led us to consider whether the extremely high concentrations of IGFBP-5 in milk from involuting mammary glands (∼50–100 μg/ml) were present solely to inhibit IGF actions or whether they were also involved in additional and perhaps IGF-independent actions (10Flint D.J. Tonner E. Allan G.J. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus we were interested in examining whether IGFBP-5 is also involved in the regulation of tissue remodeling via a direct influence upon the plasminogen system. We have identified a specific interaction of IGFBP-5 with αs2-casein (11Tonner E. Allan G.J. Flint D.J. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This milk protein has also been shown to bind plasminogen and its activator, tPA (12Heegaard C.W. Andreasen P.A. Petersen T.E. Rasmussen L.K. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 1997; 11: 29-36Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the physical apposition of all of these molecules adds further weight to the hypothesis that IGFBP-5 may directly influence aspects of plasminogen activation. The aims of this study were therefore to determine whether IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-5 mutants that are unable to bind to IGF-I or heparin are able to interact with PAI-1 and influence plasminogen activation. If so, this could provide a mechanism by which IGFBP-5 could coordinate the induction of cell death (by sequestering IGF-I) with the activation of extracellular matrix degradation by generation of the extracellular protease cascades initiated by plasminogen activators. Cell Culture—The mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11 (a subclone of COMMA-1D cells derived from mid-pregnant mice) (13Danielson K.G. Oborn C.J. Durban E.M. Butel J.S. Medina D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Bruce Whitelaw, Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, and was cultured as described previously (14Phillips K. Park M.A. Quarrie L.H. Boutinaud M. Lochrie J.D. Flint D.J. Allan G.J. Beattie J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Bovine insulin (I-6634), epidermal growth factor (E-4127), and uPA were from Sigma. tPA, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and plasminogen were from Calbiochem. PAI-1 was a mutant form (K154T, Q319L, M354I, and N150H), which is virtually unable to be converted to the latent form (half-life = 145 h at 37 °C, pH 7.4) (15Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DMEM (phenol red free 31053-028), penicillin/streptomycin (15140-122), l-glutamine (25030-024), and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. When cells reached confluence, cultures were washed with serum-free medium and treated with various combinations of plasminogen, PAI-1, and wtIGFBP-5 or mutant IGFBP-5 proteins in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were cultured for a further 24 h, at which time conditioned medium was removed for analysis of plasmin activity. At the end of the culture period, cell monolayers were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with crystal violet for histological analysis. After photographing the cells, the crystal violet stain was eluted in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, and absorbance was read at 590 nm. Treatments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Focal Adhesions—After fixation, cells were incubated with phalloidin and antibodies to vinculin to identify focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, exactly as described previously (16Deugnier M.A. Faraldo M.M. Rousselle P. Thiery J.P. Glukhova M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Death—Caspase-3 activity was measured using a colorimetric assay kit (Sigma, CASP-3-C) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of treatment, cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm CHAPS, 5 mm DTT). Lysates were then incubated with 0.2 mm Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroaniline (Ac-DEVD-pNA) in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm DTT) at 37 °C, and the absorbance at 405 nm was read at intervals to measure released pNA. Assay of Plasmin Activity—Plasmin activity was measured by incubating conditioned media, from cells cultured in serum-free conditions, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4, with 25 μl of the artificial plasmin substrate 6 mm H-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (VLL-pNA) from Bachem (0554101). The absorbance at 405 nm was measured at 15-min intervals for 4 h, and plasmin activity was determined by the rate of change in absorbance. Plasminogen Activator Assays—tPA and uPA activities were measured indirectly by their ability to convert plasminogen to plasmin followed by cleavage of the plasmin substrate VLL-pNA. tPA or uPA was incubated in the presence or absence of PAI-1 and IGFBP-5 in 96-well plates containing 2 μm plasminogen, 10 μl of 6 mm VLL-pNA, and buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl plus 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Absorbance at 405 nm was measured at 15-min intervals for 3 h. tPA standards (5–200 ng/ml) were used to determine a dose-response curve. After an initial lag phase, the generation of plasmin increased over the first 15–75 min (depending upon the quantity of tPA), and this period was used to quantitatively assess the effects of IGFBP-5 and PAI-1 on the activity of tPA, using the tPA standards as a reference. tPA activity was also measured directly using the Chromozym-tPA assay (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the tPA substrate N-methylsulfonyl-d-Phe-Gly-Arg-4-nitranilide acetate. tPA (20 ng/ml) was incubated either alone or in the presence of varying concentrations of IGFBP-5. Absorbance readings were monitored at 405 nm for 4 h. Comparison of tPA Activating Activities of IGFBP-5 with Fibrin—Soluble fibrin fragments were prepared from a suspension of fibrin from human plasma (Sigma). 100 mg/ml fibrin suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the soluble fraction in the supernatant was used. The protein concentration of soluble fibrin was determined by using the Bradford assay. Such soluble fragments of fibrin have been shown to mimic the effect of polymeric fibrin (17Anonick P.K. Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Nieuwenhuizen W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). tPA (5 ng/ml) was incubated in the absence or presence of soluble fibrin (1–100 mg/ml) or IGFBP-5 and mutants thereof (1–100 mg/ml) in 96-well plates containing 2 μm plasminogen, 10 μl of 6 mm VLL-pNA and buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl plus 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Absorbance at 405 nm was measured at 15-min intervals for 3 h. The ability of fibrin and IGFBP-5 to enhance the activity of tPA was also investigated in the presence of two inhibitors of fibrin-mediated tPA enhancement. Fibrin activation of tPA involves fibrin fragments containing C-terminal lysine residues, and we thus used a competitive inhibitor EACA, a lysine analogue, and carboxypeptidase-B that enzymatically removes C-terminal lysine residues. tPA (5 ng/ml) was incubated with fibrin or IGFBP-5 (both at 100 mg/ml) in the absence or presence of 50 mm EACA (Sigma) or 10 mg/ml pancreatic carboxypeptidase-B (Sigma) in 96-well plates containing 10 μl of 2 μm plasminogen, 10 μl of 6 mm VLL-pNA and buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl plus 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Absorbance at 405 nm was measured at 15-min intervals for 4 h. Production of Recombinant Mouse IGFBP-5—Expression of recombinant IGFBP-5 proteins was carried out using conditions identical to those described by Allan et al. (3Allan G.J. Tonner E. Barber M.C. Travers M.T. Shand J.H. Vernon R.G. Kelly P.A. Binart N. Flint D.J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4310-4319Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). cDNAs for mouse wtIGFBP-5 and various IGFBP-5 mutants minus the signal peptide-encoding sequence were cloned into the pGEX 6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) between BamHI and EcoRI in the multiple cloning site, so that the proteins would have an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. The mutants used in this study included N-term, a mutant with five mutations in the N-terminal domain (K68N/P69Q/L70Q/L73Q/L74Q) with greatly reduced affinity for IGFs (19Shand J.H. Beattie J.

The C-terminal mutants consisted of HEP–, in which four basic residues in the C terminus were mutated (R201L/K202E/K206Q/R214A (21Song H. Beattie J. Campbell I.W. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and C-term E (R201A/K202A/K206A/R207A/K208A/K211A/R214A/R216A/K217A/R218A (22Allan G.J. Tonner E. Szymanowska M. Shand J.H.

Endocrinology. 2005; 147: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)), and a mutant, C-term F, based upon C-term E but with additional mutations in the central domain of IGFBP-5 (R136A/R137A), which are involved in a second putative heparin-binding domain (23Song H. Shand J.H. Beattie J. Flint D.J. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 26: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purification of IGFBPs—IGFBPs were purified from glutathione affinity columns after release from GST using the PreScission Protease system (3Allan G.J. Tonner E. Barber M.C. Travers M.T. Shand J.H. Vernon R.G. Kelly P.A. Binart N. Flint D.J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4310-4319Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 proteins were further purified in two ways, either on IGF affinity columns and quantified as described previously (23Song H. Shand J.H. Beattie J. Flint D.J. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 26: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or by RP-HPLC. This involved using a polymeric column (PLRP-S, 300 Å; 8-μm beads; 4.6 mm diameter × 150 mm; Polymer Laboratories Ltd., Church Stretton, UK) equilibrated with a mobile phase of 25% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 1-ml aliquots of GST-purified protein (∼2 mg of protein) in cleavage buffer were injected onto the column, which was run at 1 ml/min. Isocratic elution at 25% acetonitrile for 5 min was followed by a gradient of 25–55% acetonitrile over the next 60 min. Absorbance of column eluate was monitored at 220 nm, and fractions were assessed for protein purity by SDS-PAGE and by Western immunoblotting with anti-IGFBP-5, as described previously (24Bramani S. Song H. Beattie J. Tonner E. Flint D.J. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with quantitation of protein by the Bradford assay. Fractions were lyophilized and stored at –70 °C. Proteins were redissolved in Tris-HCl/Tween 20 buffer, pH 7.4, for use. Biosensor Analysis—Biosensor studies were performed on a fully automated BIAcore 3000 instrument under conditions as described previously (19Shand J.H. Beattie J. Song H. Phillips K. Kelly S.M.

The human PAI-1 mutant was dissolved at 10 μg/ml in sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and immobilized to the surface of a carboxymethyl (CM-5) biosensor chip using standard amine coupling chemistry, also as described previously (19Shand J.H.

PAI-1 was immobilized to a level of 1000 resonance units, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was immobilized to a similar level in a control flow cell. Wild type IGFBP-5, C-term E, and N-term were analyzed for binding to PAI-1 surfaces at concentrations of 0, 93, 187, 375, 750, and 1500 nm at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Association was for 3 min, and dissociation was for 15 min. Binding was analyzed in duplicate for each protein concentration with randomization of injection for each individual analyte with respect to concentration. Biosensor chip surfaces were regenerated with 1 × 15-s pulses of 100 mm HCl, 0.5 m NaCl prior to the next cycle of analyte binding. Data were analyzed as described previously (19Shand J.H. Beattie J.

Although the IGFBP-5 proteins purified by glutathione-Sepharose were relatively pure, we did note, in some preparations, the presence of impurities, particularly IGFBP-5 fragments (see Fig. 1). The majority of these fragments was derived from IGFBP-5 as demonstrated by Western immunoblotting using an antiserum to IGFBP-5 (results not shown). We further purified IGFBP-5, either on an IGF affinity column or by RP-HPLC (Fig. 1). These subsequent purifications produced IGFBP-5, and mutants thereof, devoid of fragments. Wild-type, N-term, and C-term E are shown as examples (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the effects of IGFBP-5 described in our studies were not because of artifactual generation of IGFBP-5 polymers during the purification process, because our preparations run as monomeric proteins under native conditions, which are routinely used for Western ligand blotting (results not shown). HC11 cells attached to the substratum via numerous focal adhesions and exhibited actin stress fibers when cultured in serum-free medium in the absence of plasminogen (Fig. 2a). In contrast, in the presence of plasminogen, there was evidence of cleavage of focal adhesions, some cell migration, and increased cell-cell contact before cells died via anoikis within 12–24 h (Fig. 2, b and c). This was accompanied by a 4-fold increase in the activity of caspase 3 in the cells 24 h post-treatment, an effect that was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by PAI-1 (results not shown). Fig. 3a shows a confluent monolayer of HC11 cells cultured in serum-free conditions, stained with crystal violet. IGFBP-5, in the absence of plasminogen, showed no intrinsic ability to modify cell attachment or survival (Fig. 3b). Addition of plasminogen, in contrast, resulted in cell migration and ultimately cell death, indicating the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by plasminogen activator(s) produced by the cells (Fig. 3c). These plasmin(ogen)-induced effects were completely prevented by PAI-1 (Fig. 3d). However, the addition of IGFBP-5 to cultures containing PAI-1 and plasminogen antagonized the effects of PAI-1 and induced cell detachment (Fig. 3e). In contrast, the pGEX-6P1 empty vector control (potentially containing contaminating proteases from the bacterial expression system) failed to influence the actions of PAI-1 (Fig. 3f). Cell death was also assessed quantitatively after solubilization of crystal violet staining (Fig. 3g) and confirmed the visual changes induced in the cells by the various treatments. These effects were because of plasmin generation as confirmed by measuring plasmin activity in the medium (Fig. 4). After 24 h of culture in serum-free medium, in the absence of exogenous plasminogen, there was no evidence of plasmin activity, either in the presence or absence of IGFBP-5. However, if plasminogen was added to the HC11 cultures, plasmin activity was readily detectable in the medium removed at the end of the 24-h culture period. The addition of PAI-1, together with plasminogen, prevented plasmin formation. When IGFBP-5 was added together with PAI-1 and plasminogen, it was able to prevent the effects of PAI-1, resulting in increased plasmin generation. The pGEX-6P1 plasmid (empty vector control) failed to influence plasmin generation, indicating that any trace contamination of bacterial proteins/proteases following glutathione purification had no effect in these assays.FIGURE 4Plasmin concentration in the medium from cells cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium and treated with plasminogen, PAI-1, and IGFBP-5 as in Fig. 3. 25 μl of medium was collected and mixed with 125 μl of Tris-HCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4, and 25 μl of 6 mm VLL-pNA. Readings were taken at A405 at 15-min intervals over 4 h. A representative experiment is shown. Addition of plasminogen (squares) led to rapid generation of plasmin. Addition of PAI-1 with plasminogen (circles) completely prevented this. Addition of plasminogen, PAI-1, and IGFBP-5 (triangles) led to increased plasmin generation. Addition of PAI-1 plus proteins from the pGEX-6P1 empty vector control (crosses) failed to generate plasmin. Finally, there was no endogenous generation of plasmin in the absence of exogenous plasminogen, either without or with IGFBP-5 (diamonds; data for these last two treatments were superimposable). This experiment was performed on at least five occasions for each treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A mutant IGFBP-5 that had greatly reduced affinity for IGF-I (N-term) was as effective as wtIGFBP-5 protein in terms of cell remodeling (Fig. 5e). A mutant HEP–, which had a greatly reduced affinity for heparin, showed only a small decrease in potency when compared with wtIGFBP-5 (Fig. 5f). Details of the properties of these mutants have been reported previously (22Allan G.J. Tonner E. Szymanowska M. Shand J.H. Kelly S.M. Phillips K. Clegg R.A. Gow I.F. Beattie J. Flint D.J.

Endocrinol. 2001; 26: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made for the C-term E and C-term F, two additional non-heparin-binding mutants (results not shown). These findings were supported by determination of the plasmin concentration in the medium 24 h after addition of the treatments in serum-free medium that paralleled the phenotypic changes (results not shown). These observations indicated that the effect of IGFBP-5 on PAI-1 action was almost entirely unrelated to its ability to bind to IGFs or heparin. Biosensor analysis demonstrated that wtIGFBP-5 bound to PAI-1 with a Kd of ∼100 nm (Fig. 6a). However, the non-heparin-binding mutant C-term E had a greatly reduced affinity for PAI-1 (Fig. 6b), whereas the N-term mutant had a similar affinity to wtIGFBP-5 (Fig. 6c). Given that the C-term E had little affinity for PAI-1, it seemed unlikely that it could antagonize the effects of PAI-1 by a direct molecular interaction. We therefore examined these effects of IGFBP-5 on tPA, uPA, and PAI-1 activities in greater detail by using cell-free studies. As shown in Fig. 7, tPA and uPA generated plasmin from exogenous plasminogen, and PAI-1 could inhibit this in a dose-dependent manner. When IGFBP-5 was added into the tPA/PAI-1 mixture, as anticipated, it markedly inhibited the effect of PAI-1 (Fig. 7A). However, we also noted that, at a lower dose of PAI-1, IGFBP-5 not only inhibited the effect of PAI-1 but actually increased plasmin production to levels even greater than with tPA alone (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, when IGFBP-5 was incubated with uPA plus PAI-1, IGFBP-5 failed to inhibit the action of PAI-1 (Fig. 7C). These results suggested that IGFBP-5 was acting not by inhibiting PAI-1 but by specifically enhancing the activity of tPA but not uPA.FIGURE 6Biosensor analysis of interactions of PAI-1 with IGFBP-5.

This confirmed our hypothesis, because IGFBP-5 enhanced the effect of tPA on plasminogen in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 8A). BSA was used as a control and showed no ability to enhance tPA (Fig. 8B) or uPA activity. In complete contrast, plasmin generation by uPA was not enhanced by IGFBP-5 (Fig. 8C). More importantly, we demonstrated that, in the absence of tPA or uPA, IGFBP-5 possessed no enzymatic activity capable of cleaving plasminogen to plasmin (Fig. 8C). The ability of IGFBP-5 to enhance tPA activity was similar in preparations that were derived from the glutathione column (containing some fragments) as well as the highly purified preparations from HPLC or IGF affinity purifications that were devoid of IGFBP-5 fragments, suggesting that proteolytic fragments of IGFBP-5 present in the bacterially expressed proteins, potentially containing C-terminal lysines, were not major contributors to this effect of IGFBP-5 (results not shown). To examine the possibility that such C-terminal lysines were produced during the incubation with plasminogen, we used EACA, a lysine analogue, and carboxypeptidase-B to inhibit interactions of tPA and plasminogen with the C-terminal lysine residues, potentially present in breakdown products of IGFBP-5. Fibrin was used as a positive control and was able to enhance the activity of tPA in a dose-response fashion, resulting in increases of tPA activity greater than 40-fold (Fig. 9A). IGFBP-5 (Fig. 9C) and C-term E (results not shown) were as potent as soluble fibrin in enhancing tPA activity. EACA inhibited the effects of fibrin in a dose-dependent manner, with 100 mm EACA being completely inhibitory (Fig. 9A). Carboxypeptidase-B also markedly attenuated fibrin-mediated enhancement of tPA (Fig. 9B), and similar effects were evident when IGFBP-5 replaced fibrin (Fig. 9C). We finally determined whether the enhancement of tPA-mediated plasminogen activation by IGFBP-5 was exerted through an induced conformational change in tPA, which enhanced its direct catalytic activity. To examine this, the effect of IGFBP-5 on tPA activity was investigated in a direct amidolytic assay for tPA. IGFBP-5 showed a dose-dependent ability to increase the activity of tPA, although this was more modest (2-fold) than the effect achieved in the indirect assay (results not shown).FIGURE 9Influence of EACA and carboxypeptidase-B on tPA-catalyzed plasminogen cleavage. A, 5 ng/ml tPA was incubated alone (diamonds), with 100 mg/ml fibrin (squares), or with fibrin plus EACA at concentrations of 1 (circles), 10 (triangles), or 100 mm (crosses). B, 5 ng/ml tPA was incubated alone (diamonds), with 100 mg/ml fibrin (squares), or with fibrin plus 50 mm EACA (triangles) or with fibrin plus 10 mg/ml carboxypeptidase B (circles). C, same as for B except that 100 mg/ml IGFBP-5 replaced fibrin. All wells contained 10 μl of 6 mm VLL-pNA and 2 μm plasminogen in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured at 15-min intervals for 3 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By utilizing the epithelial cell line HC11, we were able to show that plasmin generation induced proteolytic cleavage of focal adhesions and disruption of actin stress fibers, which ultimately led to cell death as indicated by activation of caspase-3 and eventual cell detachment. These effects were inhibited by PAI-1, and we now show for the first time that IGFBP-5 can prevent these effects of PAI-1. This clearly suggests that the physical interaction of IGFBP-5 with PAI-1, as described previously (7Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2972-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), serves to inhibit the actions of PAI-1. Subsequently, we showed that IGFBP-5 mutants that were unable to bind either to IGF-I or heparin were also able to antagonize the effects of PAI-1. This was somewhat surprising given that PAI-1 has been described to interact with IGFBP-5 via its heparin-binding domain (amino acids 201–218). We thus examined IGFBP-5 interactions with PAI-1 using biosensor analysis and showed that IGFBP-5 did indeed bind to PAI-1, whereas a heparin-binding mutant (C-term E) used in this study showed greatly compromised binding to PAI-1, supporting the earlier findings of Clemmons and co-workers (7Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2972-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It was thus puzzling that a mutant with limited ability to bind to PAI-1 could nevertheless prevent the effects of PAI-1 on plasmin generation. However, we were able to show that IGFBP-5 activated plasminogen independently of PAI-1 by specifically enhancing the activity of tPA directly, although it was unable to influence the effects of uPA and had no intrinsic plasminogen cleaving activity. This finding implies that the interaction of IGFBP-5 with tPA lies out with the basic residues of the heparin-binding domain of IGFBP-5 and presumably out with the major IGF-binding site present in the N terminus of IGFBP-5, because C-term E and N-term were able to enhance tPA activity to a similar extent as wild-type IGFBP-5. The manner in which IGFBP-5 enhanced tPA activity is similar to that of fibrin. The intrinsic activity of tPA against plasminogen is very low but is considerably enhanced by fibrin (26Fischer B. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This involves two mechanisms. In the first, fibrin creates a ternary complex with tPA and plasminogen, involving interactions of tPA and plasminogen with C-terminal lysine residues of fibrin, thereby retaining the molecules in close apposition. This mechanism was also evident for IGFBP-5 because the lysine analogue EACA and carboxypeptidase-B inhibited the actions of both IGFBP-5 and fibrin. Carboxypeptidase-B or thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor inhibits fibrinolysis by removing the C-terminal lysine residues from fibrin that are required for efficient plasmin formation (27Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 28Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The second mechanism involves binding of fibrin, or fragments thereof, to tPA, which induces favorable conformational changes in both tPA and plasminogen (29Fischer B.E. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 197-204PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-5 was also able to act in this way, and this role of IGFBP-5 thus contrasts with that of a-s2 casein, which enhances the activation of tPA exclusively by ternary complex formation and exhibits no ability to enhance tPA activity in the direct amidolytic assay (12Heegaard C.W. Andreasen P.A. Petersen T.E. Rasmussen L.K. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 1997; 11: 29-36Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Most intriguingly, we have shown that IGFBP-5 binds to casein micelles and interacts exclusively with a-s2 casein on ligand blots (11Tonner E. Allan G.J. Flint D.J. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that casein micelles thus provide a matrix for plasmin generation in milk and that this serves to prevent formation of casein (milk) clotting. The presence of IGFBP-5 at high concentrations in these matrices, coupled with its ability to bind to PAI-1, provides additional support for a physiological role of IGFBP-5 in the process of plasminogen activation in vivo, at least in the mammary gland. The processes of clotting of milk and blood share numerous features on a molecular and hydrodynamic level (30Christy J.R. Macleod N. Cardiovasc. Res. 1989; 23: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The fact that IGFBP-5 can serve as an activator of tPA (an important fibrinolytic agent) and the fact that IGFBP-5 is also expressed in situations where atherosclerotic plaques are evident (31Zheng B. Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8994-9000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Jones J.I. Doerr M.E. Clemmons D.R. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 319-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and that it binds to thrombospondin and osteopontin (33Nam T.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which are involved in this process, suggest that IGFBP-5 may, in addition, play an important role in processes such as thrombolysis and wound healing. The possibility that it plays a role in localized inhibition of blood clotting is worthy of investigation. Although IGFBP-5 may play a role in maintaining the patency of mammary milk ducts, the plasminogen activator content of the rodent mammary gland is also correlated with involutionary processes, and thus plasminogen activation is also considered to be involved in the later stages of tissue remodeling (34Ossowski L. Biegel D. Reich E. Cell. 1979; 16: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). For example, in rodents, an increase in plasminogen activator production and a decrease in PAI-1 activity are correlated with the destruction of the basement membrane and loss of the secretory cells during mammary gland involution (34Ossowski L. Biegel D. Reich E. Cell. 1979; 16: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 35Talhouk R.S. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1271-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 36Busso N. Huarte J. Vassalli J.D. Sappino A.P. Belin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7455-7457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus IGFBP-5 potentially plays a dual role in mammary gland remodeling during the involutionary process. First, it sequesters IGF-I and induces cell death; and second, it activates tPA and thereby induces the proteolytic cascades, including activation of matrix metalloproteinases, which are involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix in the mammary gland. It is thus likely that IGFBP-5 serves to coordinate these events. In summary, despite the fact that we were able to confirm by biosensor analysis that IGFBP-5 binds to PAI-1, we were unable to show any direct effect of IGFBP-5 on PAI-1 activity. Rather, the ability of IGFBP-5 to counteract the effects of PAI-1 appeared to be indirect, due to activation of tPA but not uPA. Of course, this does not rule out the possibility that IGFBP-5 can influence other actions of PAI-1, such as its ability to modulate cell migration, involving a plasmin-independent process (20Imai Y.

Mutants, including a double switch variant with Lys48 and Glu327 exchanged, were expressed and assayed in Escherichia coli membranes. SeHAS(E327Q) and seHAS(E327K) were expressed at low levels, whereas seHAS(E327D) and the Lys48 mutants were expressed well. The specific enzyme activities (relative to wild type) were 17 and 7% for the K48R and K48E mutants and 26 and 38% for the E327Q and E327D mutants, respectively. In contrast, seHAS(E327K) showed only 0.16% of wild-type activity but was rescued over 46-fold by changing Lys48 to Glu. Expression of the seHAS(E327K,K48E) protein was also rescued to near wild-type levels.

The results indicate that Glu327 within MD4 is a critical residue for the stability of seHAS, that it may interact with Lys48 within MD2, and that these residues are involved in the ability of HAS to synthesize very large HA.

For example, angiogenesis is stimulated by small, but not large, HA (16West D.C. Hampson I.N. Arnold F. Kumar S. Science. 1985; 228: 1324-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 17Slevin M.

McKee C.M. Cowman M. Shin H.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2373-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Small HA fragments stimulate signal cascades in target cells through specific cell surface receptors, in particular CD44 (18Misra S. Ghatak S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20310-20315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus, large and small HA molecules can have different physiological functions. The growing recognition that certain biological responses may be dependent on HA of a particular size meshes nicely with the discovery that, although they catalyze the same reaction, different HASs can differ in the size distribution of HA they produce (20Brinck J. Heldin P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y.

For example, membranes from cells expressing HAS1 or HAS3 synthesized HA of 0.2-2.0 MDa, whereas HA of >2 MDa was produced by membranes from cells expressing HAS2 (20Brinck J. Heldin P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S.

If similar results are applicable to human cells in vivo, then the actual HA size distribution made by HAS1, HAS2, or HAS3 could be different for specific biological functions. The expression patterns for the three human HAS genes in different adult and embryonic tissues are quite distinct, as are their temporal patterns of expression during embryogenesis (23Tien J.Y. Spicer A.P. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Nardini M. Ori M. Vigetti D. Gornati R. Nardi I. Perris R. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HA of different size made by the three HAS isozymes in specific tissues at different times may, therefore, be involved in different physiological functions. There is currently great interest in understanding the mechanisms by which cells regulate HAS activity and the factors that influence the size of HA made by HAS. This is the first report in which the molar masses of HA products made by membranes containing wild-type or mutant HAS have been analyzed by SEC-MALLS (size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle laser light scattering). In the present study, we examined whether two conserved amino acids, each of which is localized within a different membrane domain (MD) of HAS, are important for HAS function. The results show their involvement in the ability of HAS to synthesize high molar mass HA and support the possibility that MD2 and MD4 are close enough for these two residues to interact directly, and possibly with HA. Vectors, Primers, and Reagents—The expression vector pKK223 was from Amersham Biosciences. Escherichia coli SURE cells and QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kits were from Stratagene. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (Spring, TX) and were purified by reverse-phase chromatography. Cy-5 fluorescent sequencing primers were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility, Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center. Other oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by The Great American Gene Co. (Ransom Hill Bioscience, Inc.). UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc were from Fluka and Sigma, respectively. UDP-[14C]GlcUA (300 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were the highest grade available from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The seHAS gene with a fusion at the 3′-end encoding a His6 tail (seHAs-His6) was cloned into pKK233 (25Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutagenic sense primers (altered codons are italic and boldface) were designed to change Glu327 to Gln (5′-CTATGGACCATACTTCAGGTGTCTATGTTTATG), Asp (5′-CTATGGACCATACTTGATGTGTCTATGTTTATG), or Lys (5′-CTATGGACCATACTTAAGGTGTCTATGTTTATG) and to change Lys48 to Arg (5′-GCTTACCTATTAGTCAGAATGTCCTTATCCTTT) or Glu (5′-GCTTACCTATTAGTCGAAATGTCCTTATCCTTT). Two complementary oligonucleotide primers encoding the desired mutation were used to create each single residue mutation. The seHAS(K48E,E327K) double mutant was made using a single mutant plasmid DNA as the template. Mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange method according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pKK233 plasmid containing the seHASHis6 gene was grown in SURE cells, purified using a Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen), and used as the template for the primer extension reaction with a pair of mutagenic primers. PCR amplification conditions using pfu DNA polymerase were: 16 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 18 min after which mutated plasmids were treated with DpnI to digest the methylated and hemimethylated parental DNA. The digested pDNA was transformed into SURE cells, and colonies were screened for the desired mutations by sequencing the isolated pDNA using fluorescently labeled terminators (ABI Prism 377 MODEL program, v2.1.1). The complete open reading frames of selected mutants were confirmed by sequencing in both directions with Cy-5-labeled vector primers on a Pharmacia ALF Express DNA Sequencer. Data were analyzed using ALF Manager, v3.02. Enzymatic Activity of seHAS Mutants—E. coli SURE cells transformed with plasmids containing various seHAS mutants were grown in Luria Bertani medium at 32 °C to A600 ∼0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested and membranes were prepared as described previously (26Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Kumari K. Heldermon C. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4246-4253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The specific activities of seHAS variants were determined at 37 °C in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium and potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 μm pepstatin, and 2 μm leupeptin, 240 μm UDP-GlcUA, 0.7 μm UDP-[14C]GlcUA, and 0.6 mm UDP-GlcNAc. Membranes (0.5-40 μg of protein) were added to initiate the enzyme reaction. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 2% (w/v), and incorporation of [14C]GlcUA into HA was determined by descending paper chromatography (7DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14568-14571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All samples were assayed in duplicate or triplicate using two or three independent membrane preparations. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Assays were performed under conditions that were linear with respect to time and protein concentration. Km and Vmax values were determined as described by Tlapak-Simmons et al. (26Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Kumari K. Heldermon C. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4246-4253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Determination of seHAS Protein Concentration in Membranes and Normalization of seHAS Activity—E. coli membranes containing wild-type or mutant seHASs were solubilized and subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% (w/v) gels (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar), and seHAS protein in each membrane preparation was quantified (25Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by image analysis of stained gels using a Fluorchem™8000 (Alpha Innotech Corp). Integrated values for seHAS bands in membranes were compared with standard curves using pure seHAS to estimate seHAS protein/mg of membrane protein (28Heldermon C.D. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2037-2046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These data were then used to normalize variant HAS activity in membranes compared with wild type. Determination of HA Size Produced by seHAS Variants—The absolute masses of the HA synthesized by wild-type or mutant seHAS were determined by SEC-MALLS analysis of unlabeled HA products. Documentation of the SEC-MALLS procedures to study HA synthesized by membranes containing HAS is described in more detail elsewhere (29Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were suspended by brief sonication at 0 °C and added to 0.5-1.0 ml of assay buffer (in microcentrifuge tubes) prepared as above but with 2% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA and without MgCl2 or substrates. UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc were added to 1 mm final concentrations, the mixture incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was added to a final concentration of 0.02 unit/μl. MgCl2 was then added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the samples were incubated for 4 h at 30°C in a vibrating Taitec mixer (San Jose, CA). Synthesis was terminated by adding EDTA and UDP to final concentrations of 40 and 10 mm, respectively, chilling on ice for ∼20 min, and then heating at 100 °C (1 min/0.1 ml) to inactivate the phosphatase. Chromatographic separation of samples was performed using two PLaquagel-OH60 (Polymer Laboratories) columns in series at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl at 22 °C. MALLS analysis was performed continuously on the eluate using a DAWN DSP Laser Photometer in series with an OPTILAB DSP Interferometric Refractometer (both from Wyatt Technologies, Inc.). Samples (200 μl) in microcentrifuge tubes were incubated in a 100 °C bath for 2 min just prior to injection. Data were analyzed using Astra v4.73, a dn/dc value of 0.153, an A2 value of 0.0023, and first order Zimm or second order Berry fits, respectively, for HA of <2 MDa or >2 MDa. General—Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Lee and Cowman (30Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Western analysis to detect seHAS was performed according to the procedure of Burnette (32Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5915) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal rabbit anti-peptide IgG (33DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with modifications as described previously (25Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Amino acid alignment of HAS family members revealed several well conserved charged or polar residues present within verified MDs. Charged or polar amino acids are not typically found within MDs, although this occurs in many proteins, because they create an unfavorable energetic situation when present within the hydrophobic bilayer. One mechanism to alleviate this is to have a second polar or oppositely charged residue near enough to allow formation of an ion pair or H-bonded pair. For example, Arg144 in the lactose permease in MD-V forms an H-bond with Glu269 in MD-VIII, and this interaction helps align and stabilize the formation of two H-bonds between Arg144 and the substrate lactose (37Abramson J. Iwata S. Kaback H.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In seHAS, Lys48 and Glu327 are within MD2 and MD4, respectively, and these residues are absolutely conserved among the streptococcal enzymes (Fig. 1). Although Lys48 in seHAS is not conserved in the other HAS family members, an absolutely conserved polar Gln residue occurs at the same position (Fig. 1A). Among eukaryotic HAS family members, the Glu327 residue of seHAS is highly conserved positionally; all HAS family members have a Glu within 3 amino acids of the position in seHAS (Fig. 1B). Lys48 could be charged or uncharged and participate in H-bond pairs within the streptococcal HASs. Like Lys, the polar side chain of Gln can engage in multiple H-bonds as an acceptor or donor. We have suggested that the MDs of HASs form an internal pore-like structure through which a growing HA chain can move and that HASs have the ability to translocate HA through the membrane as it is elongated (34Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because the streptococcal and probably also the eukaryotic HASs are phospholipid dependent (34Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39832-39835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), such a pore is likely to be formed by specific interactions within a HAS-lipid complex. The pore would also likely require specific interactions between MDs within HAS. To examine the possibility that Lys48 and Glu327 interact or are otherwise important for HAS function, we created mutants in which Lys48 was changed to Arg or Glu and Glu327 was changed to Asp, Lys, or Gln. All of these seHAS mutants were expressed, based on Western analysis (Fig. 2A), although the protein levels varied greatly (Fig. 2B). The E327D, K48R, and K48E variants showed near-wild-type expression levels (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the E327Q and E327K variants were expressed poorly. However, adding the K48E mutation restored expression of the seHAS(E327K) protein to wild-type levels. In subsequent kinetic analyses, different amounts of membrane protein were used to compensate, at least partially, for these expression differences. The HAS family members all migrate in SDS-PAGE at a considerably smaller apparent size (8DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), e.g. the ∼49-kDa seHAS migrates as a ∼42-kDa protein. This anomalous behavior indicates that, despite boiling in SDS, these proteins retain substantial secondary or tertiary structure and do not completely unfold. Interestingly, the SDS-PAGE migration rates of seHAS(E327D) and seHAS(K48E) were reproducibly slower than wild type or the other variants, indicating that these two proteins were more unfolded and more sensitive to denaturation by SDS. Normal migration was restored by adding the E327K change to the seHAS(K48E) protein (Fig. 2A). All the seHAS variants had synthase activity, although seHAS(E327K) was barely detectable (Table 1). Vmax values, relative to wild type, ranged from 0.16% for seHAS(E327K) to 38% for seHAS(E327D). Amino acid changes to similar residues at positions Lys48 or Glu327 were generally less disruptive than changes to a dissimilar polar residue. The UDP-sugar Km values for the seHAS mutants were not altered drastically; they differed from wild type by up to ∼2-fold (not shown). Although seHAS variants with Glu327 changed to Asp or Gln had good activity, the E327K variant had dramatically less activity (Table 1). However, both the activity and expression of seHAS(E327K) were greatly increased by combining this mutation with the reciprocal change at position 48 to create the seHAS(K48E,E327K) mutant. This double switch variant was expressed as well as wild type (Fig. 2B) and exhibited 7.4% of wild-type activity. The conversion of Lys48 to Glu essentially rescued the seHAS(E327K) enzyme, increasing activity of this variant by >46-fold.TABLE 1HA synthase activities and molar masses of HA products produced by seHAS variants at Lys48 and Glu327 Multiple experiments using two-three independent membrane preparations were performed to analyze Vmax values and the weight-average molar mass of HA made by membranes containing the indicated seHAS variants.

Perturbing this pore might alter the rate at which HAS could translocate a growing HA chain (resulting in a decreased synthesis rate) and also affect the ability of HAS to retain the growing HA chain, resulting in smaller HA products. There are no reports using SEC-MALLS to characterize HA made by membranes containing HAS, despite the fact that MALLS is one of the best techniques to assess the size distributions and absolute masses of polydisperse HA. We recently developed a procedure to perform such analyses (29Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and used this new approach to quantify possible differences in HA size made by these seHAS variants (Figs. 3 and 4). The weight-average molar mass values are summarized in Table 1. The gel filtration profiles show that the distributions of HA products remained normal (i.e. approximately symmetric) even though the mutants made smaller HA (Fig. 3). The seHAS(K48E) and seHAS(K48E,E327K) variants made the smallest HA, with essentially identical molar masses. The weight-average masses of HA products made by the wild-type enzyme and seHAS(K48E,E327K) were 3.64 and 0.61 MDa, respectively (Fig. 4, Table 1). Fig. 4 illustrates the high quality light scattering data that can be obtained for HA made by membranes expressing seHAS.FIGURE 4SEC-MALLS analysis of HA synthesized by membrane-bound wild-type seHAS or seHAS(K48E,E327K). Unlabeled HA was synthesized by membranes containing wild-type seHAS (solid line, filled circles) or the double switch mutant (dashed line, filled triangles) and then processed and analyzed by SEC-MALLS.

Although good progress has been made in understanding HAS topology (28Heldermon C.D. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2037-2046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and the mechanism of HA chain elongation, several key questions about HAS function remain unanswered. One question is how HAS controls HA product size. A second concerns the mechanism by which the HA products are transferred to the cell exterior, since the active sites of the enzyme are intracellular (28Heldermon C.D. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2037-2046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Others have suggested that HAS makes HA inside the cell and that HA-specific ABC transporters then transport HA to the outside of the cell (41Ouskova G. Spellerberg B. Prehm P. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have suggested that membrane-bound HASs are inherently able to translocate HA chains across the bilayer during biosynthesis (10Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 13Weigel P.H.

This hypothesis is based on a variety of findings, including that the UDP-sugar binding sites are located at or very near the membrane-HAS interface (42Kumari K. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and, unlike virtually all other glycosyltransferases, the HASs are phospholipid dependent (34Tlapak-Simmons V.L.

In addition, the genetic and biochemical data show that if substrates are present, HAS is the only protein required for HA biosynthesis. When bacteria that do not normally make HA are transformed with the hasA gene and genes for the synthesis of UDP-sugar precursors, the cells make and, importantly, secrete HA into the medium. For example, no other exogenous genes except hasA are needed for Enterococcus faecalis (7DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14568-14571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Bacillus subtilis (43Widner W. Behr R. Von Dollen S. Tang M. Heu T. Sloma A. Sternberg D. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H.

Based on radiation inactivation analysis of two streptococcal HASs (35Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26100-26109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and Xenopus HAS1 (36Pummill P.E. Kempner E.S. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39832-39835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the active membrane-bound enzymes contain only a single HAS protein (rather than an oligomer), but the protein is associated with an additional mass of ∼23 kDa. This extra mass could not be identified for the active HAS1 enzyme but was identified as cardiolipin for the streptococcal enzymes (35Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Kempner E.S. Baggenstoss B.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26100-26109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, an active streptococcal HAS is one protein in complex with about 16 molecules of cardiolipin. When purified in the absence of cardiolipin, the streptococcal HASs show very low activity, but when this phospholipid is restored enzyme activity increases ∼10-fold (34Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, all HAS family members might require lipid to synthesize HA, but different HASs may require different types of lipids. We proposed that cardiolipin molecules help the enzymes to create a pore-like passage within the HAS-lipid complex through which a growing HA chain passes (34Tlapak-Simmons V.L.

If the MDs of HAS form a pore through which HA passes during biosynthesis, then there are likely to be very specific interactions between MDs that stabilize this structure and mediate its cycle of making and breaking interactions with the HA chain as the HA-UDP is alternately translocated or extended. The results show that changing either Lys48 or Glu327 can inhibit enzyme activity and alter HA product size and support the possibility that Lys48 and Glu327 are binding partners that mediate interaction between MD2 and MD4. This latter conclusion is supported strongly by the rescue of both protein expression and enzyme activity in the double switch mutant compared with the E327K mutant. Although other explanations can be proposed for rescue of the E327K variant by introducing the K48E change, the simplest is that the Glu and Lys residues at these two positions directly interact. Based on the topology of seHAS (28Heldermon C.D. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2037-2046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), Lys48 and Glu327 are within the same region of the bilayer (Fig. 5A) and could interact physically. Because of the very short extracellular loops of HAS, MD1-MD2 and MD4-MD5 are likely to be adjacent MD pairs (e.g. Fig. 5B). It is also possible that the two polar residues within MD2 and MD4 interact with polar groups in HA and are involved in the HA alignment or translocation process during synthesis. When the enzyme is not engaged in HA synthesis, then the two side chains might directly interact as suggested above. An interesting hybrid of these two ideas is that Lys48 and Glu327 could switch between these two states in an alternating way (i.e. interacting with each other versus with HA) during chain elongation and translocation. Translocation of HA through the enzyme would likely require the coordinated movement of one or more MDs bound to the chain to achieve HA movement. This would have to be a cyclic process in which the interactions between residues in HAS and specific groups within the HA chain were made and then broken as the chain was translocated in a ratchet-like manner through the membrane to the cell exterior. Although changing either residue influences HA product size, Glu327 appears to be more critical for seHAS activity than Lys48. Changing Glu327 to the very similar Asp had minimal effect on protein expression and reduced HA product size by only ∼12%, whereas changing Glu327 to Lys destabilized the protein, reduced expression, and drastically inhibited activity. The K48R and K48E mutants were both well expressed, indicating that these changes did not destabilize the protein. The slower migration of seHAS(K48E) in SDS-PAGE and its smaller HA product size (∼19% of wild type) are consistent with the mutant protein being less compact and hindered in either HA bond formation, HA translocation, or both. We interpret all of these results to indicate that Glu327 participates in H-bonding or ionic interactions that are structurally important. The relative tolerance to changes at Lys48 suggests that if this residue interacts with Glu327, then Glu327 likely also has important interactions with other residues. The two side chains could interact either directly or indirectly through water, phospholipid head groups, or other side chains. The results in the present study indicate that there is not a simple correlation between the effects of a mutation on enzyme activity compared with enzyme stability as assessed by migration in SDS-PAGE. A possible explanation for this is that both Lys48 and Glu327 also likely interact with other residues in HAS and possibly with groups in HA as noted above. If these two residues interact in a complex, alternating cyclic manner with side chains in the protein and in HA, then correlations among enzyme activity, protein stability, and domain flexibility may not be apparent for individual mutants or may be too complex to sort out without substantially more structural information. A pore region within HAS would have multiple contacts with the growing HA-UDP chain. Differences in the energetics of these intermolecular contacts among the three eukaryotic HAS isozymes could alter the balance between HA retention and HA release forces and result in inherent differences in HA size distributions made by HAS variants or native HAS isozymes (44Heldermon C. Kumari K. Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Weigel P.H. Abatelangelo G. Weigel P.H. New Frontiers in Medical Sciences: Redefining Hyaluronan. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam2000: 41-50Google Scholar). For example, a mutation that decreased HA retention by HAS could result in decreased average HA product size. Further studies are needed to test this model and to elucidate the roles of Lys48, Glu327, and other conserved amino acids in the ability of HAS to make HA of a particular size."

To identify unknown targets or signal transduction pathways that are regulated by PTEN, microarray analysis was performed to compare the gene expression profiles of Pten null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) cell lines and their isogenic counterparts. Expression of a heparin binding growth factor, pleiotrophin (Ptn), was found to be up-regulated in Pten–/– MEFs as well as Pten null mammary tumors. Further experiments revealed that Ptn expression is regulated by the PTEN-PI3K-AKT pathway. Knocking down the expression of Ptn by small interfering RNA resulted in the reduction of Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation and suppression of the growth and the tumorigenicity of Pten null MEFs. Our results suggest that PTN participates in tumorigenesis caused by PTEN loss and PTN may be a potential target for anticancer therapy, especially for those tumors with PTEN deficiencies.

Loss of function mutations or reduced expression of the PTEN gene are found at high frequencies in a wide variety of human tumors, including glioblastoma, as well as endometrial, prostate, colorectal, lung, and breast cancers. Experimental and clinical evidence demonstrate that PTEN is a critical tumor suppressor (4Parsons R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). PTEN acts primarily as a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway by virtue of its lipid phosphatase activity (5Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2600) Google Scholar, 6Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M.

Liu X. Wu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6199-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Loss of PTEN leads to an increase in the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate level, mimicking the effect of constitutive PI3K activation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate accumulation results in the activation of various protein kinases, including the PDK1 and PKB/AKT serine/threonine kinases. AKT is the central node in the PTEN-regulated pathway and activated AKT has been shown to promote cell cycle progression, cell growth, cell survival, cell migration, angiogenesis, protein synthesis, and glucose metabolism through phosphorylation of its substrates (8Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 387-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 9Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). Aside from acting as a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway, which depends on its lipid phosphatase activity, PTEN also functions independently of its lipid phosphatase activity. Raftopoulou et al. (10Raftopoulou M. Etienne-Manneville S. Self A. Nicholls S. Hall A. Science. 2004; 303: 1179-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) showed that PTEN inhibits cell migration through its C2 domain and dephosphorylates itself depending on its protein phosphatase activity. Freeman et al. (11Freeman D.J. Li A.G. Wei G. Li H.H. Kertesz N. Lesche R. Whale A.D. Martinez-Diaz H. Rozengurt N. Cardiff R.D. Liu X. Wu H.

To further understand the biological functions of PTEN, we undertook an unbiased approach by comparing gene expression profiles of a Pten–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line with that of its isogenic counterpart (11Freeman D.J.

Among genes that are differentially expressed in these cell lines, we found that pleiotrophin (Ptn) was up-regulated in the Pten–/– MEFs as well as mammary tumor tissues of Pten conditional knock-out mice (14Li G. Robinson G.W. Lesche R. Martinez-Diaz H. Jiang Z. Rozengurt N. Wagner K.U. Wu D.C. Lane T.F. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Wu H. Development. 2002; 129: 4159-4170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further experiments indicated that the expression of Ptn was regulated by the PI3K pathway, and Ptn overexpression contributes to tumorigenesis caused by PTEN loss. Cell Culture and Generation of Immortalized Fibroblasts—Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin, and penicillin, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Immortalized wild-type (Pten+/+) and Pten–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were generated independently according to the 3T9 protocol (13Liliental J. Moon S.Y. Lesche R. Mamillapalli R. Li D.

The PtenΔloxp/Δloxp (PtenΔ/Δ) cell line was generated by infecting immortalized PtenLoxP/LoxP (PtenL/L) mouse embryonic fibroblasts with an adenovirus vector expressing Cre recombinase (11Freeman D.J.

Microarray Analysis—Mouse cDNA microarrays containing 8,928 elements were printed by the UCLA Microarray Core Facility. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For probe labeling and microarray hybridization, a protocol published by Xiang et al. (15Xiang C.C. Kozhich O.A. Chen M. Inman J.M. Phan Q.N. Chen Y. Brownstein M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was adopted with minor modifications. Briefly, cDNA probes that incorporate aminoallyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP; Sigma) were synthesized by reverse transcription using 10 μg of total RNA in a 30-μl reaction volume, containing oligo(dT) primer (0.5 μg/μl, 2 μl), RNase inhibitor (Promega, 5 units/μl, 1 μl), 1× first-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm dATP/dGTP/dCTP, 0.3 mm dTTP, 0.2 mm aa-dUTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, 1.9 μl). The reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 2 h and terminated by addition of EDTA (0.5 m, 10 μl). The RNA was hydrolyzed with NaOH (1 m, 10 μl) and the solution was neutralized with HCl (1 m, 10 μl), and then Microcon 30 concentrators (Millipore) were used to clean up the cDNA. Purified cDNA from Pten null and wild-type MEFs was labeled with either Cy5 or Cy3 monoreactive fluors (Amersham Biosciences), combined, and competitively hybridized to microarrays under a coverslip for 16 h at 65 °C. Microarray slides were scanned using the GenePix 4000A fluorescent scanner (Axon Instruments), variable photomultiplier tube voltage settings were used to obtain the maximal signal intensities with <1% probe saturation and balanced intensities between the two channels (ratio of medians is ∼1). The experiment was performed in duplicate using independently isolated RNA samples. Raw data files were generated and analyzed using the GenePix 3.0 microarray analysis software, then imported into Excel. Features for which R2 values were below 0.4 and less than 50% of feature pixels that were 1 S.D. above background pixels in either channel were filtered out. Features with ratio of medians ≥2 were considered to be up-regulated and features with ratio of medians ≤0.5 were considered to be down-regulated. Extraction of RNA and Northern Blot Hybridization—RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the procedure provided by the manufacturer. Total RNA was separated on 1.0% agarose gels in the presence of formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized in QuikHyb® hybridization solution (Stratagene). Probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the random priming kit (Prime-It® II, Stratagene). DNA Constructs and Transfection—Constructs containing wild-type Pten and the C124S mutant were generated by ligating corresponding Pten cDNA into BglII and SalI sites of the pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech). Constructs containing wild-type (WT) Akt1 and dominant negative Akt1 were generated by cutting Akt1 cDNAs in pUSEamp (Upstate) with BamHI and PmeI, and ligating into BglII and SmaI sites of the pIRES2-EGFP vector. For constructs expressing activated Akt1, a PCR fragment containing activated Akt1 (16Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) was ligated into EcoRI and SmaI sites of the pIRES2-EGFP vector. DNA constructs were transfected into MEFs and 3T3 cells using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Inhibitor Treatments—MEF1 cells were treated with 10 and 30 μm phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (BIOMOL), and 50 μm mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-specific inhibitor, PD98059 (BIOMOL), for 24 h, then subjected to Northern hybridization. siRNA—Three siRNAs were designed to target the open reading frame of the mouse Ptn gene at site A (131–149 nucleotides), B (243–261 nucleotides), and C (325–343 nucleotides). The oligonucleotides used were: (A) sense, 5′-GATCCCAGTCTGACTGTGGAGAATGttcaagagaCATTCTCCACAGTCAGACTttttttGGAAA-3′ and antisense, 3′-GGTCAGACTGACACCTCTTACaagttctctGTAAGAGGTGTCAGTCTGAaaaaaaCCTTTTCGA-5′; (B) sense, 5′-GATCCCGACTCAGAGATGTAAGATCttcaagagaGATCTTACATCTCTGAGTCttttttGGAAA-3′ and antisense, 3′-GGCTGAGTCTCTACATTCTAGaagttctctCTAGAATGTAGAGACTCAGaaaaaaCCTTTTCGA-5′; (C) sense, 5′-GATCCCGTGTGACCTCAATACCGCCTttcaagagaAGGCGGTATTGAGGTCACAttttttGGAAA-3′ and antisense, 3′-GGCACACTGGAGTTATGGCGGAaagttctctTCCGCCATAACTCCAGTGTaaaaaaCCTTTTCGA-5′. These oligonucleotides were annealed and subcloned to the downstream H1 promoter in pSilencer™ 3.1-H1 hygro vectors (Ambion) using BamHI and HindIII. To test the knocking down abilities of the 3 siRNAs against Ptn, plasmids carrying Ptn-siRNA A, B, or C, or siRNA negative control (Ambion) were transiently transfected into 3T3 cells using Lipofectamime 2000 (Invitrogen), the cells were subjected to Northern hybridization using Ptn cDNA as probe. To generate cell lines stably expressing Ptn siRNA, 2 × 105 PtenΔ/Δ-241 cells were transfected with plasmids carrying Ptn-siRNA A, B, C, or control siRNA, respectively, and cultured for 48 h. The cells were then selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin for 2 weeks; the obtained clones were screened for Ptn knocking down by Northern hybridization. Cell Growth Curve—Cells were seeded into 24-well plates in triplicates at a density of 8 × 103 per well, the number of live cells was determined by trypan blue staining and was scored daily for 7 days with a hematocytometer under an inverted microscope. Statistical Analysis—Microsoft Excel was used to analyze the data and plot curves. Analysis of variance was applied for multiple comparisons. Tumorigenecity in Nude Mice—Athymic female nude mice were each injected subcutaneously with 4 × 106 PtenΔ/Δ-241 cells stably expressing Ptn siRNA B or control siRNA (n = 8 for each group). The mice were kept in pathogen-free environments and checked every 2 days. The dates, at which a palpable tumor first arose, and the weights of the tumors were recorded. Western Blot Analysis—Protein was extracted using RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium dexoycholate, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche)) and fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blots were then probed with the antibodies against PTN (R&D Systems), and AKT, phospho-AKT (Thr-308), phospho-GSK-3β and β-actin, which were all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and LumiGLO™ reagent (Cell Signaling Technology) were used to detect specific binding, and signals were captured by x-ray film. Genes Differentially Expressed in Pten WT and Null MEF Cell Lines—To identify unknown targets or signal transduction pathways that are regulated by PTEN, we compared gene expression profiles of Pten WT and null mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines (7Sun H.

Sixteen genes were found to be up-regulated with ratio of medians above 2.0 (Table 1), whereas 30 genes were found to be down-regulated with ratio of medians below 0.5 (Table 2), based on two independent microarray analysis. Eight of 10 differentially expressed genes could be confirmed by other means, such as Northern blot analysis, reverse transcriptase-PCR, or Western blot analysis (data not shown), indicating the high quality of our microarray analysis.TABLE 1Genes that are up-regulated in Pten–/–MEF cellsGene symbolDescriptionUnigene No.Ratio of mediansABCxcl12 (Sdf1)Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12Mm.30323110.62911.256Ccnd2Cyclin D2Mm.3334064.8924.088Trim10 (Rnf9)Tripartite motif protein 10Mm.2991554.4993.818Fn1Fibronectin 1Mm.1930994.2643.495Timp3Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3Mm.48713.933.265SlpiSecretory leukocyte protease inhibitorMm.3715833.7971.839Zfp36l1 (Brf1)Zinc finger protein 36, C3H type-like 1Mm.2351323.4582.576Bicc1Bicc1: Bicaudal C homolog 1 (Drosophila)Mm.2868342.9792.713PtnPtnMm.2796902.9663.345Rbp1Retinol-binding protein 1, cellularMm.2797412.4542.438Serpine2Serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor, clade E, member 2Mm.30932.3582.226Sepp1Selenoprotein P, plasma, 1Mm.226992.2932.48Slc39a10Solute carrier family 39 (zinc transporter), member 10Mm.2338892.2182.125Pde7bPhosphodiesterase 7BMm.3702162.1612.124Snx5Sorting nexin 5Mm.2733792.1482.04Scamp2Secretory carrier membrane protein 2Mm.2860692.0913.662 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Genes that are down-regulated in Pten–/– MEF cellsSymbolDescriptionUnigene No.Ratio of mediansABMmp2Matrix metalloproteinase 2Mm.295640.2390.382Npepl1Aminopeptidase-like 1Mm.2956290.260.274Zfp148Zinc finger protein 148Mm.2568090.2640.26Foxo1Forkhead box O1Mm.298910.2810.304Bat8HLA-B-associated transcript 8Mm.353450.2820.421Scarb2Scavenger receptor class B, member 2Mm.2979640.290.456E430026A01RikRIKEN cDNA E430026A01 geneMm.294020.3150.222Sdcbp2Syndecan-binding protein (syntenin) 2Mm.320680.3490.182Ly6cLymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus CMm.15830.3590.353Pdlim2PDZ and LIM domain 2Mm.2839680.360.444Ap3s2Adaptor-related protein complex 3, σ-2 subunitMm.2201730.3660.217Lgals3Lectin, galactose binding, soluble 3Mm.2486150.3660.473Gsta3Glutathione S-transferase, α3Mm.147190.3660.151Cnn1Calponin 1Mm.43560.3720.2971110013G13RikRIKEN cDNA 1110013G13 geneMm.2103050.3750.129Ube2iUbiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2IMm.2400440.3850.294Cyp2f2Cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily f, polypeptide 2Mm.45150.3980.309Rnf144Ring finger protein 144Mm.2149320.4060.32Pte2aPeroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase 2AMm.2023310.4090.33Cyr61Cysteine rich protein 61Mm.12310.4140.259Gpr125G protein-coupled receptor 125Mm.2729740.440.3119030409G11Rik:RIKEN cDNA 9030409G11 geneMm.2559860.440.4512310047C17RikRIKEN cDNA 2310047C17 geneMm.2038660.4440.278H2-BfHistocompatibility 2, complement component factor BMm.6530.4530.47Akp2Alkaline phosphatase 2, liverMm.2881860.4540.318Prpf3PRP3 pre-mRNA processing factor 3 homolog (yeast)Mm.2798720.4570.475TfpiTissue factor pathway inhibitorMm.1243160.4740.308Dab2ipDisabled homolog 2 (Drosophila) interacting proteinMm.296290.4820.355Hrb2HIV-1 Rev-binding protein 2Mm.346060.4860.334BC034204CDNA sequence BC034204Mm.39570.4980.451 Open table in a new tab We further checked the expression statuses of these genes in another line of Pten null MEFs, which is designated as PtenΔ/Δ. The PtenΔ/Δ cell line was generated by transfecting immortalized PtenLoxP/LoxP (PtenL/L) mouse embryonic fibroblasts with an adenovirus vector expressing Cre recombinase. Ptn, among several other genes (data not shown), was also up-regulated in PtenΔ/Δ cells (Fig. 1A). An interesting observation to be noted is that up-regulation of Ptn in Pten-null MEFs is cell density-dependent: the differences in Ptn level between WT and Pten–/– MEF cells are more significant when cells reach high density. As shown in Fig. 1B, there was no difference in Ptn expression level between WT and Pten–/– MEF cells when they are on log phase, but significant difference was observed when they reached confluence, and a more significant difference was observed 2 days after they reached confluence (Fig. 1B). Because PTN, a secreted growth factor, can promote cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis (17Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T.

Development. 2002; 129: 4159-4170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ptn mRNA expression levels increased strikingly in mammary tumors of the PtenLoxp/Loxp;MMTVCre+/– mice, as compared with the WT controls (Fig. 2A). The increase of Ptn expression in mammary tumors of the mutant mice could also be detected by Western blots (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Ptn overexpression may either correlate with or participate in tumorigenesis caused by PTEN loss. Ptn Expression Is Regulated by PI3K/AKT Pathways—We then determined which pathway was involved in Ptn transcription regulation using various pathway-specific inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 3A, Ptn expression was significantly down-regulated by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 at a concentration of 30 μm (Fig. 3A, third lane; quantification shown on the right panel). On the other hand, no significant changes of Ptn expression were seen when the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-specific inhibitor PD98059 was used, indicating that the expression of Ptn is regulated by PI3K pathways. Chemical inhibitor treatment can only provide a rough picture on how Ptn is regulated. To further define the pathways that may be involved in Ptn regulation, we transfected various Pten constructs into 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, transfection of wild-type Pten into 3T3 cells could suppress the expression of Ptn, whereas a non-functional, mutated form of Pten (C124S phosphatase-dead mutation) had no effect. Overexpression of wild-type and the activated form of Akt-1 also resulted in up-regulation of Ptn, whereas expression of a dominant-negative form of Akt-1 resulted in a down-regulation of Ptn expression (Fig. 3C), indicating that regulation of Ptn by PTEN is PI3K/AKT-dependent. siRNA against Ptn Could Suppress the Malignant Phenotypes of Pten Null Cells—To assess the tumorigenicities of the Pten null cell lines in vivo, we injected PtenΔ/Δ MEFs into nude mice subcutaneously, and observed the mice for 4 months. PtenΔ/Δ MEFs could form tumors in nude mice with a latency of greater than 2.5 months. We then dissociated tumors and cultured the tumor cells in vitro. A clonally derived line, PtenΔ/Δ-241, was used for study as described below because of its shorter tumor forming latency. To test if knocking down the expression of Ptn can reverse the malignant phenotypes of the PtenΔ/Δ-241 cells, we designed 3 siRNAs against the mouse Ptn gene. To test the knocking down abilities of the siRNAs against Ptn, 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids expressing the Ptn siRNAs and subjected to Northern blot analysis. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 4A, Ptn-siRNA B and C had better knocking down abilities than Ptn-siRNA A. Plasmids containing Ptn-siRNA B or C were then stably transfected into PtenΔ/Δ-241 cells, 3 clones for Ptn-siRNA B and 2 clones for Ptn-siRNA C were picked, and Ptn expression levels were tested by Northern blots. The expression of Ptn in clone 2of Ptn-siRNA B was almost totally knocked down, whereas clone 2 of Ptn-siRNA C had less reduction (Fig. 4A, right panel). We then measured growth properties of these two clones and compared the control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). Consistent with expression levels of Ptn seen in Fig. 4B, the growth rate of clone 2 of Ptn-siRNA B was significantly decreased, whereas the growth rate of clone 2 of Ptn-siRNA C showed mild reduction, indicating that reduction of Ptn expression could inhibit the growth of PtenΔ/Δ-241 cells. We then injected clone 2 of Ptn-siRNA B into nude mice. For the mice injected with PtenΔ/Δ-241 cells transfected with control siRNA, 5 of 8 developed tumors with a latency of 21 to 47 days; whereas in mice injected with clone 2 of Ptn-siRNA B, only one of eight had tumor with latency of more 90 days (Table 3). Taken together, these results indicate that knocking down the expression of Ptn could suppress the tumorigenicity of Pten null cells and overexpression of Ptn may indeed participate in tumorigenesis caused by PTEN loss.TABLE 3siRNA directed against Ptn significantly inhibits PtenΔ/Δ-241 cell growth in nude miceSiRNAInjectionsTumorsTumor weightLatencygDaysNegative control850.1239-1.522aWeighed at 2 months after injection.21-47Ptn siRNA B810.4125bWeighed at 4 months and 10 days after injection.>90a Weighed at 2 months after injection.b Weighed at 4 months and 10 days after injection.

Several possibilities could explain these discrepancies. First, PTEN could regulate different sets of genes in different cell types, tissues, or systems. Second, additional genetic alterations may be introduced during the process of model establishing, which is not directly related with PTEN expression. For example, alterations of p53 or p19 functions are usually associated with immortalizing MEFs (32Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Ra"

Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP), a type I integral membrane protein with one transmembrane domain, by enzymatic digestion involving β- and γ-secretase activities (3Xia W. Curr. Ne1urol. Neurosci. Rep. 2001; 1: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cleavage of APP by β-secretase generates an ∼100-kDa soluble N-terminal fragment and a 12-kDa C-terminal fragment (C99), which can be further cleaved by γ-secretase to yield the APP intracellular domain and 40- and 42-amino acid-long Aβ peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42), the latter of which appears the most prone to aggregate (the amyloidogenic pathway) (4Lorenzo A.

Besides its role in APP processing, γ-secretase can also modulate the proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor (6De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S.

The Notch signaling pathway mediates a wide range of developmental cell fate decisions. In response to ligand binding, Notch receptors undergo an extracellular cleavage at a site near the membrane, generating a membrane-tethered C-terminal domain. Subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase at a site within the transmembrane domain releases the Notch intracellular domain that translocates to the nucleus where it associates with RBP-Jκ and other transcription factors to regulate the promoters of specific target genes of the pathway (14Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

In addition to APP and Notch, γ-secretase also catalyzes the proteolytic release of the intracellular domains of numerous other type I transmembrane receptors, underscoring its complex role in cell signaling and development (17De Strooper B.

Activation of caspase-3, a member of the evolutionary conserved cysteine-aspartate-specific protease family, leads to caspase-dependent apoptosis (24Robertson G.S. Crocker S.J. Nicholson D.W. Schulz J.B. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 25Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar), and this also occurs in zebrafish (26Negron J.F. Lockshin R.A. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 231: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Under most circumstances, two transcription factors, p53 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) play opposite roles in promoting apoptosis. Activation of p53 enhances cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and it is mutated in more than 50% of human tumors (27Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4402) Google Scholar, 28Bates S. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 29Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7400) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB, on the other hand, usually leads to the expression of anti-apoptotic genes, like caspase-8/FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein or inhibitors of apoptosis. In mammalian cells, depending on the specific cell type and the type of inducer, NF-κB can also promote apoptosis under certain conditions (30Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). The NF-κB transcription factor family includes several structurally related proteins, and in zebrafish, three NF-κB molecules, p65, c-Rel, and p100, have been identified (31Correa R.G. Tergaonkar V. Ng J.K. Dubova I. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Knocking down p65 and p100 caused defective posterior morphogenesis, resulting in mutant embryos with a short trunk and tail. Recent studies have demonstrated that the NF-κB subunit p65 can sequester p53 in an inactive complex, thereby inhibiting p53-stimulated apoptosis (32Jeong S.J. Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M.F. Park H.U. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10326-10332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Jeong S.J. Radonovich M. Brady J.N. Pise-Masison C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 1490-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have found that selective knockdown of Pen-2 in developing zebrafish embryos induced a strong p53-dependent apoptotic cascade throughout the whole animal (34Campbell W.A. Yang H.W. Zetterberg H. Baulac S. Sears J.A. Liu T. Wong S.T.C. Zhong T.P. Xia W. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 1423-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear whether NF-κB/p65 was involved in the Pen-2 knockdown-elicited apoptotic pathway. To dissect the molecular property of Pen-2 that plays an important and specific role in promoting cell survival and protecting cells from apoptosis in vivo, we generated constructs expressing truncated Pen-2 molecules lacking either the cytosolic or the C-terminal domain. We found that the cytosolic loop of Pen-2 harbors an anti-apoptotic activity and that the C-terminal 12 amino acids are dispensable for the anti-apoptotic activity of Pen-2. Importantly, knocking down Pen-2 appeared to trigger an unconventional pro-apoptotic activity of NF-κB in zebrafish, because double knockdown of Pen-2 and p65 suppressed caspase activation found in single Pen-2 knockdown embryos. Fish Strains—Embryos were obtained from natural spawning of wild-type (Tübingen long fin strain) adults; they were raised and staged according to Kimmel et al. (35Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W.

Antisense Morpholino Injection—Pen-2 MO directed against the translation start codon of the Pen-2 mRNA (Gene Tools, Corvallis, OR) was injected into fertilized zebrafish eggs at the one-cell stage. The morpholino sequences were as follows: Pen-2 MO, 5′-CATAATGAAGTATTTGTGGTGGTGG-3′; p65 MO, 5′-CCCACTGGTGAAACATTCCGTCCAT-3′; standard control against the zebrafish β-globin intron, 5′-CCTCCTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′. MO oligonucleotides were dissolved in 1× Danieu solution at a concentration of 5 mm, diluted to 0.1 mm (Pen-2 and control) or 0.5 mm (p65 and control) prior to injection, and ∼4-8 ng was injected into each embryo. After injection, the embryos were incubated at 28.5 °C in embryo medium (37Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1994Google Scholar). Generation of Truncated Pen-2 and Injection of Capped RNA—The full-length zebrafish Pen-2 cDNA with a FLAG tag at the N terminus was generated by PCR (forward primer, 5′-ATGGACTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGATGAATCTGGAAAGGATTCCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AAGGTGAAGCAGCGGGTCTC-3′) and subcloned into the pCS2+ vector. The zebrafish Pen-2 cDNA with the last 12 amino acids deleted and containing a FLAG tag at the N terminus was generated by PCR (forward primer, 5′-ATGGACTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGATGAATCTGGAAAGGATTCCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCATCCCACTTCACCCCACTG-3′) and subcloned into the pCS2+ vector. The resulting plasmid was designated Pen-2ΔC. A construct encoding Pen-2 with a 15-amino acid deletion in the cytosolic domain was constructed by PCR amplification of the N- and C-terminal fragments of the Pen-2 cDNA, using the primer pairs 5′-AAATACGGATCCATGGACTACAAGGATGACGACGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAACACATATGATTTAAAAAACCA-3′ (reverse) and 5′-AAGTCATATGTAAAGAAGTCTGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGCGGTCTAGAAAGGTGAAGCAGCGGGTCTC-3′ (reverse), respectively. The two PCR products were cleaved with BamHI and NdeI and NdeI and XbaI, respectively, and the fragments were ligated into a BamHI- and XbaI-opened pCS2+ vector. The resulting plasmid was designated Pen-2ΔL. Capped RNA was synthesized using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions, resuspended in water, and injected at a concentration of 10 ng/μl along with Pen-2 MO. Acridine Orange Staining—Live embryos were manually dechorionated at 24 h and placed in the vital dye acridine orange (AO) (acridinium chloride hemi-zinc chloride; Molecular Probes) at 16.7 μg/ml in embryo medium for 20 min. The embryos were anesthetized in 0.0003% 3-amino-benzoic acid ethylester (Sigma) and viewed using an Olympus SZX12 microscope. Caspase Assay—Twenty-four hours after injection 20 zebrafish embryos were homogenized in 100 μl of modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA) without protease inhibitors. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C) and stored at -80 °C pending analysis. Caspase-3 activity was determined using a caspase-3 activity detection kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). The caspase-3 fluorometric substrate (Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC) was prepared as a stock solution of 3.6 mm in Me2SO, stored in -20 °C, and used at a final concentration of 36 μm after dilution in modified RIPA buffer. At the start of the proteolytic assay, 50 μl of embryo lysate (10 embryos) and 50 μl of RIPA-diluted substrate were added to a 96-well plate (Nunc), and fluorescence of the cleavage product was repeatedly measured over time at room temperature for 1 h in a Wallac 1420 Multilabel Counter plate reader (PerkinElmer), with the excitation wavelength at 350 nm and the detection wavelength at 460 nm. Maximal enzyme activity (Vmax) was calculated and expressed as relative fluorescence units/second. The embryos treated with 800 nm of the potent protein kinase C inhibitor and apoptosis inducer staurosporine (38Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 39Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar) for 24 h were used as positive controls, and the embryos treated with an equal volume of Me2SO were used as negative controls. TUNEL Staining—TUNEL assay was performed using the TMR-RED in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Optical sections were taken with the Zeiss LMR510 confocal microscope. We injected zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage with an antisense modified oligonucleotide (morpholino) directed against the 5′ end of the first exon of the Pen-2 gene. The embryos were harvested at 24 h post fertilization (hpf) and lysed for Western blot with an antibody against zebrafish Pen-2. Compared with uninjected embryos or embryos injected with a control MO, Pen-2 MO clearly reduced the expression of Pen-2 (Fig. 1B). Injection of control MO against β-globin intron did not affect the expression level of endogenous Pen-2, which was identical to that from uninjected embryos. We analyzed two phenotypic characteristics of Pen-2 MO-injected embryos, an opaque region in the head and a curved tail (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). Previous studies have shown that γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT-treated zebrafish show defects in somitogenesis and defective anteroposterior polarity (40Geling A. Steiner H. Willem M. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Upon DAPT treatment, most posterior somites do not form normally, resulting in a short or curved tail. This phenotype strikingly resembles zebrafish Notch pathway mutants like beanter (bea), deadly-seven (des), after-eight (aei), and white-tail (wit), which can be rescued by microinjection of notch intracellular domain. Therefore, the short or curved tail in Pen-2 MO-injected embryos was the phenotype related to impaired γ-secretase-mediated Notch signaling.TABLE 1Number of embryos demonstrating unique phenotypes upon the injection of Pen-2 MO and mRNAMO/mRNATotalOpaque region in head and curved tailCurved tail only; no opaque region in headNormalUninjected990 (0%)10 (10%)89 (90%)Control MO1070 (0%)8 (7%)99 (93%)Pen-2 MO219201 (92%)9 (4%)9 (4%)Pen-2 MO/FL mRNA1767 (4%)19 (11%)150 (85%)Pen-2 MO/ΔL mRNA205174 (85%)17 (8%)14 (7%)Pen-2 MO/ΔC mRNA15424 (16%)115 (75%)15 (9%) Open table in a new tab The reduction of Pen-2 protein in Pen-2 MO-injected embryos also led to large opaque regions primarily located in the head of the fish (Fig. 2B, left panel), in contrast to control MO-injected embryos (Fig. 2A, left panel). These opaque regions were most likely due to massive cell death, accompanied by precipitation of proteins. To determine whether apoptosis contributed to these opaque regions, we used the vital dye, AO, to stain these live embryos. AO staining verified a significant degree of cell death throughout the embryos (Fig. 2B, center panel) and abundantly in the head (Fig. 2B, right panel). This is consistent with our previous finding that knockdown of Pen-2 results in extensive TUNEL-positive staining in the whole animal (34Campbell W.A. Yang H.W. Zetterberg H. Baulac S. Sears J.A. Liu T. Wong S.T.C. Zhong T.P. Xia W. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 1423-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Co-injection of in vitro transcribed mRNA encoding full-length Pen-2 along with Pen-2 MO rescued this phenotype (Fig. 2C), and over 85% of embryos showed normal phenotypes similar to those of control MO injected embryos, compared with only 4% of Pen-2 MO-injected embryos showing normal phenotypes (Table 1). To determine which domain of Pen-2 harbors the anti-apoptotic activity, two deletion constructs were made, one containing a deletion of amino acids 40-54 in the cytosolic loop region of Pen-2 (Pen-2ΔL) and another containing a deletion of the C-terminal amino acids 90-101 (Pen-2ΔC) (Fig. 1A). The deletions did not change the topology of Pen-2, because the two-transmembrane domain structure of truncated Pen-2 still existed, according to the prediction using the dense alignment surface in silico method (41Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The truncated Pen-2 constructs were transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells, and the cells were lysed for Western blotting. Staining with antibody against the FLAG tag clearly showed different sizes of full-length and truncated Pen-2 molecules, in contrast to a lack of staining in untransfected cells (Fig. 3B, left panel). To determine whether the truncated Pen-2 could be stably expressed in zebrafish embryos, we injected capped RNA along with Pen-2 MO into embryos and lysed embryos at 24 hpf for Western blotting. Because the MO was designed to encompass the upstream of the ATG codon, as well as the codon itself, the FLAG-tagged Pen-2 RNA had no overlap with the MO. Thus, Pen-2 MO did not target injected Pen-2 RNA and affect the expression levels of Pen-2ΔL and Pen-2ΔC. Although Pen-2 MO significantly reduced endogenous Pen-2 levels, compared with control MO-injected embryos, exogenous FLAG-tagged full-length Pen-2 and Pen-2ΔL were expressed at high levels (Fig. 3B, right panel). Even Pen-2ΔC was expressed at moderate levels, indicating that the truncated Pen-2 variants were stable and could be easily detected by Western blotting of lysates prepared from injected embryos (Fig. 3B). We examined the Pen-2 MO/Pen-2 RNA co-injected embryos by AO staining. Co-injection of in vitro transcribed mRNA encoding Pen-2ΔL failed to rescue the apoptotic phenotype, resulting in a phenotype indistinguishable from that obtained by injection of Pen-2 MO alone (Fig. 2D). The majority of embryos (85%) showed opaque regions in the head and a curved tail, a phenotype represented by almost all Pen-2 MO-injected embryos (92%) (Table 1). A large number of apoptotic cells corresponded to the opaque areas in the brain region (Fig. 2D). On the contrary, co-injection of in vitro transcribed mRNA encoding Pen-2ΔC rescued the apoptotic phenotype. Only a small percentage of embryos still showed opaque regions in the head (16%, Table 1), and almost no apoptotic cells were detected in Pen-2ΔC-injected embryos (Fig. 2E). The morphology of rescued embryos was different from that of wild-type embryos (Fig. 2E). Consistent with previous findings that Pen-2ΔC is not functional in the γ-secretase complex (20Hasegawa H.

Steiner H. Willem M. Bally-Cuif L. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Apparently, Pen-2ΔC could not rescue the phenotype caused by the lack of a functional γ-secretase complex in Pen-2 knockdown embryos, and 75% of the embryos carried curved tails (Table 1). However, expression of Pen-2ΔC prevented embryos from undergoing apoptosis, because the opaque regions were no longer observed in 84% of the embryos injected with Pen-2 MO and Pen-2ΔC mRNA (Table 1). To verify that the opaque regions in the head represented excessive apoptosis, we established a biochemical measurement of apoptosis in whole animals by optimizing a method to determine caspase-3 activity in zebrafish embryos (Fig. 4). Treatment of embryos with staurosporine, a potent inducer of apoptosis (38Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), induced a significant caspase-3 activation compared with embryos treated with an equal volume of the carrier (Me2SO). Injection of embryos with Pen-2 MO alone resulted in an even stronger activation of caspase-3. This activation could be completely abrogated by co-injecting the Pen-2 MO along with capped mRNA encoding full-length Pen-2. However, co-injection of Pen-2ΔL mRNA could not inhibit the activation of caspase-3, consistent with the earlier finding that it failed to rescue the apoptotic phenotype induced by Pen-2 knockdown (Fig. 2D). Co-injection of Pen-2ΔC mRNA completely suppressed the caspase-3 activation. Although the 12 amino acids deleted in Pen-2ΔC have been shown to be critical for the stabilization of presenilin fragments and restoration of γ-secretase activity (20Hasegawa H. Sanjo N. Chen F.

https://openalex.org/W2079624210,"Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) is the prototype of a subgroup of metalloproteinases with manifold roles in morphogenesis. Four mammalian subgroup members exist, including BMP1 and mammalian Tolloid-like 1 (mTLL1). Subgroup members have a conserved protein domain structure: an NH2-terminal astacin-like protease domain, followed by a fixed order of CUB and epidermal growth factor-like protein-protein interaction motifs. Previous structure/function studies have documented those BMP1 protein domains necessary for secretion, and activity against various substrates. Here we demonstrate that, in contradiction to previous reports, the most NH2-terminal CUB domain (CUB1) is not required for BMP1 secretion nor is the next CUB domain (CUB2) required for enzymatic activity. The same is true for mTLL1. In fact, secreted protease domains of BMP1 and mTLL1, devoid of CUB or epidermal growth factor-like domains, have procollagen C-proteinase (pCP) activity and activity for biosynthetic processing of biglycan, the latter with kinetics superior to those of the full-length proteins. Structure-function analyses herein also suggest differences in the functional roles played by some of the homologous domains in BMP1 and mTLL1. Surprisingly, although BMP1 has long been known to be Ca2+-dependent, a property previously assumed to apply to all members of the subgroup, mTLL1 is demonstrated to be independent of Ca2 levels in its ability to cleave some, but not all, substrates. We also show that pCP activities of only versions of BMP1 and mTLL1 with intact COOH termini are enhanced by the procollagen C-proteinase enhancer 1 (PCOLCE1) and that mTLL1 binds PCOLCE1, thus suggesting reappraisal of the accepted paradigm for how PCOLCE1 enhances pCP activities.

Such components include collagen types I–III, V, VII, and XI; small leucine-rich proteoglycans biglycan and osteoglycin; the ECM cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase; the basement membrane protein laminin 5; and dentin matrix protein 1, which is thought to be involved in initiating mineralization of ECM in hard connective tissues (1Greenspan D.S. Top. Cur. Chem. 2005; 247: 149-183Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the BMP1-like proteinases act in morphogenesis by activating certain members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily of growth factors. This includes activation of BMPs 2 and 4 via cleavage of the extracellular antagonist chordin and activation of growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) 8 (also known as myostatin) and 11 (also known as BMP11) via cleavage within prodomain sequences to release mature GDF8 and 11 from noncovalent, latent complexes (1Greenspan D.S.

Thus, BMP1-like proteinases not only regulate formation of the ECM and signaling by a subset of transforming growth factor-β-like factors but may orchestrate the two in morphogenetic events.

The BMP1-like proteinases share a common protein domain structure comprising an NH2-terminal prodomain that must be cleaved by furin-like proprotein convertases to yield the mature proteinase. This is followed by a protease domain common to the astacin M12A family of the M12 subclade of metalloproteases (6Greenspan D.S. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Elsevier, London2004: 621-623Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and then by EGF-like motifs and CUB (complement-Uegf-BMP1) domains, thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions (1Greenspan D.S.

BMP1 differs from the other three mammalian members of this family in lacking the most COOH-terminal EGF motif and two most COOH-terminal CUB domains found in the other three proteinases (1Greenspan D.S. Top. Cur. Chem. 2005; 247: 149-183Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The four mammalian BMP1-like proteinases differ in their distributions of expression and in the phenotypes resulting from ablation of their cognate genes (1Greenspan D.S. Top. Cur.

In regard to the latter difference, ablation of the Bmp1 gene, which encodes both BMP1 and mTLD, results in perinatal lethality and defects of ventral wall closure, probably reflecting defects in ECM formation and dorsal-ventral patterning (9Suzuki N.

They have also reported that retention of the most COOH-terminal BMP1 CUB domain (CUB3) is required for full enhancement of BMP1 pCP activity by the PCOLCE1. The latter has previously been thought to enhance cleavage of procollagen C-propeptides solely by binding to procollagens, thus inducing conformational changes that make them fitter substrates for BMP1-like proteinases (13Kessler E.

In the present report, we demonstrate that CUB1 is not necessary for secretion of either BMP1 or mTLL1 and that secreted BMP1 and mTLL1 protease domains devoid of CUB or EGF-like domains retain pCP activity and have enhanced activity, compared with full-length BMP1 or mTLL1, for the biosynthetic processing of probiglycan at the physiologically appropriate site. We also demonstrate that PCOLCE1 only enhances full-length mTLL1 and BMP1 and not truncated versions missing the most COOH-terminal EGF and CUB domains and that full-length mTLL1, but not truncated versions of mTLL1, binds PCOLCE1. Finally, mTLL1 is shown to be independent of Ca2+ levels in the ability to cleave some, but not all, substrates. This is in contrast to the long known Ca-2+ dependence of BMP1 proteolytic activities (13Kessler E. Adar R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Kessler E.

To generate a form of mTLL1 truncated after the CUB3 domain (TLL1-CUB3), oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCAAATCTGACAATACTGTATCCAAGAAGGGCTTCAAACTAGTGCCGCGGGGAAGCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTAGTCTAGAGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCTCTAGACTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGCTTCCCCGCGGCACTAGTTTGAAGCCCTTCTTGGATACAGTATTGTCAGATTTG-3′ were annealed to create a sequence encoding the COOH-terminal portion of the CUB3 domain fused to a thrombin cleavage site and a COOH-terminal FLAG epitope. The annealed oligonucleotides were cloned between an EcoRI site in the mTLL1 sequence and an NotI site in pcDNA4/TO. Expression vectors for the other truncated forms of mTLL1 were constructed via PCR amplification and cloning of amplimers between a Bsu36I site in mTLL1 coding sequences and a SacII site in the thrombin cleavage site sequence. A common forward primer used for all such amplification was 5′-AATGGACCTCAGGCAATCTCTATC-3′, whereas reverse primers were 5′-TTCCCCGCGGCACTAGACATCTATACAGCTTTCTTGCCT-3′ (for TLL1-proteinase): 5′-TTCCCCGCGGCACTAGATAGACAGCTGCAAAGCCTTTTCC-3′ (TLL1-CUB1) and 5′-TTCCCCGCGGCACTAGTTTGTTCACAGTTCCGTCAGAAAC-3′ (for TLL1-CUB2). To generate truncated forms that retained the mTLL1 COOH-terminal domain, oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGTGATAAGATATCCAGATACCACACATACCAAAAAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTTTTGGTATGTGTGGTATCTGGATATCTTATCA-3′ (antisense) were annealed to each other, thus creating the sequences encoding the COOH-terminal domain. The annealed oligomers were cloned between SpeI and SacII sites in the thrombin cleavage site sequences in the expression vectors for truncated forms described above. To produce BMP1 and truncated forms, a cDNA encoding full-length human pro-BMP1 (5Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.

To generate a form of BMP1 truncated after the CUB2 domain (BMP1-CUB2), PCR was performed using forward primer, 5′-TGGCGGATCCAGGTGTCTGAGGGCTT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GATCGCGGCCGCTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCGATTTTGTTAATGGACCCGTCAGAGACGA-3′. The PCR amplimer was cloned between a BamHI site in the BMP1 sequence and a NotI site in pcDNA4/TO. The resulting construct contains a COOH-terminal FLAG epitope, separated from BMP1 sequences by a ClaI site. To generate a form of BMP1 truncated after the CUB1 domain (BMP1-CUB1), oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCCGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAATTGGGTTGGAAAGGGCTTCTTTGCAGTCTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGTAGACTGCAAAGAAGCCCTTTCCAACCCAATTGCTGCTGCTGCGG-3′ (antisense) were annealed and cloned between an EcoRI site in BMP1 sequences and a ClaI site in the CUB3 construct.

Cells at 80% confluence were transfected with 1 μg of expression plasmid/35-mm culture dish using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were selected in the same type of medium containing 200 μg/ml Zeocin. Resistant clones were isolated by ring cloning, and clones producing high levels of secreted full-length or truncated mTLL1 or BMP1 upon induction with 1 μg/ml tetracycline were identified by Western blot. For the production of recombinant proteinases for enzymatic assays, confluent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by addition of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline, to induce protein expression, and 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Conditioned medium was harvested every 24 h, and protease inhibitors were added to final concentrations of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid. Conditioned medium was centrifuged to remove debris, and supernatants were stored at –70 °C. Proteins were affinity-purified from medium using an anti-FLAG M2 affinity column (Sigma), as described (5Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A.

For the Western blot analyses of Fig. 2, cell layers were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, after the second harvest of media, and then scraped into hot SDS-sample buffer. 20 μl of second harvest conditioned media and equivalent amounts of cell layer samples were then separated on 4–15% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). In Vitro Enzyme Assays—2 μg of full-length mTLL1 was incubated at 37 °C with 15 ng of trypsin or chymotrypsin (Promega) in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, respectively, for the indicated times. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer and boiling 5 min at 100 °C. Proteins were separated on 4–15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gradient gels and visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. Collagen processing was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. 400 ng of 3H-labeled type I procollagen, prepared as previously described (5Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N.

Full-length or truncated mTLL1 or BMP1 was then added to a 12 nm final concentration (except that for experiments in which collagen processing in the absence or presence of Ca2+ was compared, 24 nm of isolated BMP1 and mTLL1 protease domains was used), and the reaction was stopped after 16 h at 37 °C by adding SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were separated on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel and followed by treatment of the gel with EN3HANCE (DuPont) and autofluorography. 500 ng of probiglycan, prepared as described (18Scott I.C. Imamura Y.

Subsequently, 0.01 unit of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Corp.) and 6× chondroitinase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 240 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm EDTA) were added to the reaction, and samples were incubated an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer, and proteins were separated on a 7.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel. For studies on Ca2+ dependence of probiglycan cleavage, assays were performed essentially as above, except that 500 ng of probiglycan was incubated 16 h with 1 nm full-length or truncated BMP1 or mTLL1 in the presence or absence of 5 mm CaCl2. Recombinant chordin was prepared, and processing reactions were performed essentially as previously described (5Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L.

Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—The products of cleavage assays, performed as described above, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Proteins were revealed with 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation at the Harvard University Microchemistry Facility. Far Western Blotting—100 ng of full-length mTLL1 and equal molar amounts of truncated forms of mTLL1 were separated on a 4–15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel under non-reducing conditions and were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5 mm CaCl2 (TBS-T/Ca2+) 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with or without 200 ng/ml PCOLCE1 in 0.5% nonfat dry milk/TBS-T/Ca2+ overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with TBS-T/Ca2+ buffer, the membrane was incubated with anti-PCOLCE1 antibodies and washed as previously described for PCOLCE1 Western blots (17Steiglitz B.M. Keene D.R.

Characterization of mTLL1 Domain Structure by Limited Proteolysis—Limited digestions were performed to define boundaries of folded protein domains in mature, active 120-kDa mTLL1. Digestion with trypsin produced major protein fragments of ∼60, 45, and 38 kDa (Fig. 1, A and C), whereas digestion of mTLL1 with α-chymotrypsin produced ∼92, 65, 60, 45, 39, and 17 kDa protein fragments (Fig. 1, B and C). Subsequent NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing showed the 60- and 38-kDa trypsin products to correspond to COOH-terminal fragments resulting from cleavage between mTLL1 residues 564KA565, and 724KA725, respectively, in the published human pro-mTLL1 sequence (Ref. 4Takahara K. Brevard R. Hoffman G.G. Suzuki N. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1996; 34: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, GenBank™/EBI accession number U91963). NH2-terminal sequences of the 45-kDa fragment corresponded to the NH2 terminus of mature mTLL1, beginning with the first amino acid after the predicted furin cleavage site for removal of the prodomain (5Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Thus, based on SDS-PAGE mobility and NH2-terminal sequence, the 45-kDa band is predicted to represent the NH2-terminal fragment resulting from cleavage at the 564KA565 site (Fig. 1C). A somewhat heterogeneous ∼65-kDa band (Fig. 1A) may correspond to the NH2-terminal product of cleavage at the 724KA725 site but was not in sufficient amounts to obtain amino acid sequences. Edman degradation of chymotrypsin fragments showed the 60- and 39-kDa bands to both correspond to COOH-terminal portions resulting from cleavage between mTLL1 residues Ser558 and Asp559. Thus, based on SDS-PAGE mobility, the 60-kDa fragment is predicted to extend to the COOH terminus of mature mTLL1, whereas the size of the 39-kDa fragment is consistent with a COOH terminus somewhere near the junction of the CUB4 and CUB5 domains (Fig. 1C). NH2-terminal sequences of the 92-, 65-, 45-, and 17-kDa fragments all corresponded to the NH2 terminus of mature mTLL1. Thus, based on SDS-PAGE mobility and NH2-terminal sequences, the 45-kDa fragment is predicted to represent the NH2-terminal fragment resulting from cleavage at the 558SD559 site, whereas the 92-, 65-, and 17-kDa NH2-terminal fragments are predicted to be truncated at positions illustrated in Fig. 1C. Cleavage by chymotrypsin and trypsin between CUB2 and EGF1 and by trypsin between CUB3 and EGF2 demonstrates these to be linker regions, which lie between individually folded domains and to be relatively exposed to proteases. Bands relatively resistant to protease digestion likely represent tightly folded protein domains. These limited proteolysis results differ in marked ways from results obtained by Sieron et al. (22Sieron A.L. Tretiakova A. Jameson B.A. Segall M.L. Lund-Katz S. Khan M.T. Li S. Stocker W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) for limited proteolysis of mTLD with chymotrypsin. These differences, illustrated in Fig. 1C, suggest that, despite identical domain structures, mTLL1 and mTLD may differ in folding. However, use of pro-mTLD in the earlier study and mature, active mTLL1 here makes direct comparison difficult, because retention of the prodomain may affect folding and protease accessibility of the protease, CUB, and EGF domains. Structure-Function Analyses of mTLL1 Domains: Secretion—To determine the roles of various mTLL1 protein domains, a number of recombinant truncated versions of mTLL1 were produced for functional comparison to full-length mTLL1. Proteins TLL1-CUB3, TLL1-CUB2, TLL1-CUB1, and TLL1-protease are versions of mTLL1 truncated at, and inclusive of, the CUB3, CUB2, CUB1, and protease domains, respectively (Fig. 2A). The COOH termini of TLL1-CUB2 and TLL1-CUB3 were Lys564 and Lys724, respectively, thus corresponding to COOH termini resulting from limited trypsin proteolysis (see above). This represents an attempt to have ends of these forms correspond to natural boundaries of mTLL1 protein domains, as defined by the limited proteolysis studies described above. Surprisingly, all of these truncated proteins were secreted from transfected 293 T-REx cells as efficiently as full-length, except for the longest truncated protein, TLL1-CUB3 (Fig. 2B), which was secreted less efficiently, because a faint CUB3 band was only visible in the media sample after prolonged exposure of the blot (data not shown). These results were surprising for three reasons: 1) truncated versions shorter than TLL1-CUB3 were efficiently secreted, whereas TLL1-CUB3 was not; 2) TLL1-CUB3 has a domain structure very similar to that of wild-type BMP1, which normally ends at CUB3; and 3) previous studies with truncated versions of BMP1 have shown that retention of CUB1 in its proper position is necessary for secretion of the protease domain to occur (11Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For a direct structure-function comparison of mTLL1 and BMP1 protein domains, a series of truncated versions of BMP1, with COOH termini corresponding to those of the truncated mTLL1 proteins (Fig. 2A), were expressed, together with full-length BMP1, under conditions identical to those under which mTLL1 and its truncated forms were expressed in Fig. 2B. As can be seen (Fig. 2C), all truncated forms of BMP1 were secreted. Although the form corresponding to isolated BMP1 protease domain (BMP1-protease) was secreted with less efficiency than the other forms, it has previously been reported that isolated BMP1 protease is not secreted at all (11Hartigan N. Garrigue-Antar L. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18045-18049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, CUB1 is not essential for secretion of either mTLL1 or BMP1 protease domains but does enhance secretion in the case of BMP1.

https://openalex.org/W2094897846,"The Cdc7 kinase is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. Two regulatory subunits of the Xenopus Cdc7 kinase have been identified: XDbf4 and XDrf1. In this study we determined the expression pattern of XDbf4 and XDrf1 and examined their involvement in DNA replication. We show that XDrf1 expression is restricted to oogenesis and early embryos, whereas XDbf4 is expressed throughout development. Immunodepletion from Xenopus egg extracts indicated that both proteins are only found in complexes with XCdc7 and there is a 5-fold molar excess of the XCdc7/Drf1 over SCdc7/Dbf4 complexes. Both complexes exhibit kinase activity and are differentially phosphorylated during the cell cycle. Depletion of the XCdc7/Drf1 from egg extracts inhibited DNA replication, whereas depletion of XCdc7/Dbf4 had little effect. Chromatin binding studies indicated that XCdc7/Drf1 is required for pre-replication complex activation but not their assembly. XCdc7/Dbf4 complexes bound to the chromatin in two steps: the first step was independent of pre-replication complex assembly and the second step was dependent on pre-replication complex activation. By contrast, binding of XCdc7/Drf1 complexes was entirely dependent on pre-replication complex assembly. Finally, we present evidence that the association of the two complexes on the chromatin is not regulated by ATR checkpoint pathways that result from DNA replication blocks. These data suggest that Cdc7/Drf1 but not Cdc7/Dbf4 complexes support the initiation of DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts and during early embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1964303330,"ATP-dependent drug transport by human P-glycoprotein (Pgp, ABCB1) involves a coordinated communication between its drug-binding site (substrate site) and the nucleotide binding/hydrolysis domain (ATP sites). It has been demonstrated that the two ATP sites of Pgp play distinct roles within a single catalytic turnover; whereas ATP binding or/and hydrolysis by one drives substrate translocation and dissociation, the hydrolytic activity of the other resets the transporter for the subsequent cycle (Sauna, Z. E., and Ambudkar, S. V. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 2515–2520; Sauna, Z. E., and Ambudkar, S. V. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 11653–11661). Trapping of ADP (or 8-azido-ADP) and vanadate (ADP·Vi or 8-azido-ADP·Vi) at the catalytic site, following nucleotide hydrolysis, markedly reduces the affinity of Pgp for its transport substrate [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin ([125I]IAAP), resulting in dissociation of the latter. Regeneration of the [125I]IAAP site requires an additional round of nucleotide hydrolysis. In this study, we demonstrate that certain thioxanthene-based allosteric modulators, such as cis-(Z)-flupentixol and its closely related analogs, induce regeneration of [125I]IAAP binding to vanadate-trapped (or fluoroaluminate-trapped) Pgp without any further nucleotide hydrolysis. Regeneration was facilitated by dissociation of the trapped nucleotide and vanadate. Once regenerated, the substrate site remains accessible to [125I]IAAP even after removal of the modulator from the medium, suggesting a modulator-induced relaxation of a constrained transition state conformation. Consistent with this, limited trypsin digestion of vanadate-trapped Pgp shows protection by cis-(Z)-flupentixol of two Pgp fragments (∼60 kDa) recognizable by a polyclonal antiserum specific for the NH2-terminal half. No regeneration was observed in the Pgp mutant F983A that is impaired in modulation by flupentixols, indicating involvement of the allosteric modulator site in the phenomenon. In summary, the data demonstrate that in the nucleotide-trapped low affinity state of Pgp, the allosteric site remains accessible and responsive to modulation by flupentixol (and its closely related analogs), which can reset the high affinity state for [125I]IAAP binding without any further nucleotide hydrolysis.

Interestingly, the [125I]IAAP-binding site once transformed to its low affinity state remains unaltered even after dissociation of vanadate and ADP from the catalytic sites of Pgp (27Sauna Z.E.

Washed cells were incubated on ice for 45 min in homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm mannitol, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin) and disrupted by repeated strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Following homogenization, undisrupted cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and diluted with resuspension buffer (containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was washed once with the same buffer and resuspended in resuspension buffer containing 10% glycerol by passing through a hypodermic needle (gauge size 19 and then 23). Membranes were stored at –70 °C in aliquots. Protein concentration was measured by a modified Lowry method (35Bailey J.L. Techniques in Protein Chemistry.

Recovery of [125I]IAAP Binding to Vanadate-trapped and Fluoroaluminate-trapped Pgp—Isolated insect cell membranes (0.1–0.15 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in ATPase assay buffer (50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium azide, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 1.25 mm 8-azido-ATP and 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate. The reaction was stopped by transferring the samples on ice, and the excess 8-azido-ATP as well as vanadate were removed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium azide, 2 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol; divided into aliquots (15 μg of protein/100 μl); and incubated at 37 °C for varying periods of time. Wherever indicated, 25 μm Pgp modulators (cis-(Z)-flupentixol, cis-(Z)-clopentixol, cis-(Z)-753) or 1.25 mm 8-azido-ATP was added to the resuspended membranes 5 min prior to incubation at 37 °C. Incubation was stopped at the indicated time intervals; 5 nm [125I]IAAP was added to each tube, incubated on ice for 5 min, and photocross-linked by UV irradiation for 5 min at room temperature. The photocross-linked samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radioactivity associated with the Pgp band was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis and captured on an x-ray film for documentation. Regeneration of fluoroaluminate-trapped Pgp was carried out similar to vanadate-trapped Pgp, except trapping was done in the presence of 0.5 mm AlCl3 plus 2.5 mm NaF. Dissociation of [α-32P]8-Azido-ADP from Pgp—Isolated insect cell membranes (1 mg/ml) were incubated in ATPase assay buffer (50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium azide, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 50 μm [α-32P]8-azido-ATP, and 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate at 37 °C under subdued light for 30 min. Reactions (vanadate trapping) were stopped by adding 12.5 mm ice-cold ATP and transferring the tubes immediately on ice. Following trapping, free nucleotides and sodium orthovanadate were removed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium azide, 2 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The resuspended membranes were incubated at 37 °C, and at various times 100-μl aliquots (100 μg of protein) were transferred to ice and UV-photocross-linked at 365 nm for 10 min. Wherever indicated, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate and 25 μm cis-(Z)-flupentixol of Pgp modulator were added to the samples prior to incubation of the resuspended pellet at 37 °C. The photocross-linked samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the radioactivity associated with the Pgp band was documented and quantified. Limited Trypsin Digestion of Vanadate-trapped Pgp—Insect cell membranes (0.6 mg/ml) were vanadate-trapped at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence of 1.25 mm 8-azido-ATP and 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate in ATPase assay buffer (final volume 2 ml). The reaction was stopped by adding equal volumes of 12 mm ice-cold ATPase buffer, and excess nucleotides and vanadate were removed by centrifugation at 300,00 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Membrane pellet was resuspended in 1.86 ml of ice-cold resuspension buffer, containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm mannitol, and 50 mm sodium chloride. Following resuspension, vanadate-trapped membranes were divided into 100-μl aliquots and incubated at 37 °C for varying periods of time with trypsin at 0.6 mg/ml final concentration. Wherever indicated, the vanadate-trapped membrane was incubated on ice for 5 min with 25 μm cis-(Z)-flupentixol prior to incubation with trypsin. Trypsin digestion was stopped by adding 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Samples equivalent to 3 μg of membrane protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and peptide bands were detected by immunoblotting with Pgp-specific polyclonal antiserum PEPG13. The intensity of the major bands was quantified using densitometric software Image SXM. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (36Germann U.A. Chambers T.C. Ambudkar S.V. Licht T. Cardarelli C.O. Pastan I.

Since allosteric modulator cis-(Z)-flupentixol stimulates [125I]IAAP interaction with Pgp through a site functionally distinct from the substrate site (31Dey S. Hafkemeyer P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6630-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32Maki N. Hafkemeyer P. Dey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18132-18139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we investigated its ability to interact with the vanadate-trapped conformation and regenerate [125I]IAAP binding to the substrate site. [125I]IAAP is a transport substrate for Pgp and can be conveniently photocross-linked by UV irradiation to its interaction site, allowing a snapshot of the functional property of the Pgp substrate site, both spatially and temporally. Although the photoaffinity labeling does not provide a stoichiometric binding, inhibition studies with other transport substrates (such as vinblastine) and competitive modulators (such as cyclosporin A) suggest that the affinity-labeled fraction is a fair representation of the entire Pgp population. Also, instead of ATP, we used 8-azido-ATP to be consistent with the experiments done in parallel to study [α-32P]8-azido-ADP trapping and dissociation. As indicated in Fig. 1A, in the presence of 1.25 mm Mg·8-azido-ATP, [125I]IAAP binding to vanadate-trapped Pgp was completely regenerated, whereas no comparable regeneration was observed in the absence of any added nucleotide (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, when vanadate-trapped membranes were incubated with 25 μm cis-(Z)-flupentixol in a vanadate- and nucleotide-free medium, a complete regeneration of [125I]IAAP binding was observed within 2.5 min of incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 1, A and B). To avoid the possibility of any residual 8-azido-ATP being hydrolyzed during incubation with cis-(Z)-flupentixol, no Mg2+ was added, and the reaction was supplemented with 0.25 mm EDTA. No modulator-induced regeneration of the [125I]IAAP binding was observed in the Pgp F983A mutant that is impaired in interaction with cis-(Z)-flupentixol (Fig. 1, A (bottom) and B). Therefore, the results suggest that even in the vanadate-trapped conformation of Pgp, the allosteric site is accessible to modulator interaction and capable of regenerating [125I]IAAP binding to the substrate site in the absence of nucleotide hydrolysis. It was not totally clear why the regenerated level of [125I]IAAP binding was higher than that bound to untrapped Pgp. One possible explanation is that since both the untrapped and trapped Pgp were subjected to similar washing and centrifugation steps, some of the untrapped Pgp molecules get inactivated during the procedure, whereas the tightly bound ADP and vanadate at the catalytic site conferred protection to the trapped Pgp from such inactivation. Ligand-induced protection of enzymatic activity is a well known phenomenon. Similar to vanadate, fluoroaluminate in combination with ATP inhibits Pgp ATPase activity, which involves trapping of nucleotide in catalytic sites (37Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fluoroaluminate-trapped Pgp also showed reduced [125I]IAAP binding, indicating formation of a low affinity transition state (Fig. 2). Consistent with our observation in vanadate-trapping experiments, regeneration of [125I]IAAP binding was achieved both in the presence of 1.25 mm 8-azido-ATP (up to 90%) and 25 μm cis-(Z)-flupentixol (up to 200%). Therefore, the effect of cis-(Z)-flupentixol was not limited to vanadate-trapped Pgp and was reproducible using a different mode of trapping. We also observed that structurally related thioxanthene derivatives, cis-(Z)-clopentixol and cis-(Z)-753, were able to induce 75–100% regeneration of [125I]IAAP binding to fluoroaluminate-trapped Pgp, respectively (Fig. 2). Modulator-induced Regeneration of [125I]IAAP Binding Is Facilitated by Dissociation of the Trapped ADP and Vanadate—To understand the mechanism by which allosteric modulator cis-(Z)-flupentixol regenerates [125I]IAAP binding to vanadate-trapped Pgp, it is important to determine whether dissociation of 8-azido-ADP and vanadate has to precede regeneration. Although vanadate and [α-32P]8-azido-ADP have been shown to dissociate spontaneously from the vanadate-trapped Pgp upon incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 3A, top), dissociation can be experimentally slowed down by inclusion of 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate in the medium (Fig. 3A). No additional effect on dissociation was observed with the inclusion of cis-(Z)-flupentixol up to a concentration of 25 μm (Fig. 3A). When we studied the effect of the substrate site, regeneration by cis-(Z)-flupentixol (25 μm) of [125I]IAAP binding to vanadate-trapped Pgp was considerably delayed in the presence of 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate (Fig. 3B). As expected, vanadate alone was unable to regenerate [125I]IAAP binding (Fig. 3B). This suggests that substrate site regeneration by cis-(Z)-flupentixol is facilitated by dissociation of trapped 8-azido-ADP and vanadate from the catalytic site. One possibility is that in the vanadate-trapped conformation, the second ATP site remained occupied by unhydrolyzed 8-azido-ATP with bound Mg2+, which was occluded from EDTA in the medium, and stimulation of hydrolysis of the occluded nucleotide by cis-(Z)-flupentixol induced the regenerating effect. The fact that no vanadate-trapped 32P]8-azido-nucleotide was retained after 30 min of incubation in a vanadate- and nucleotide-free medium (Fig. 3A, top) minimized the possibility. However, to conclusively rule out any further [α-32P]8-azido-ATP hydrolysis during the regeneration phase of the experiment, we incubated vanadate-induced [α-32P]8-azido-ADP-trapped Pgp in a nucleotide- and vanadate-free medium f"
https://openalex.org/W2049757809,"Activity of Ho, the yeast mating switch endonuclease, is restricted to a narrow time window of the cell cycle. Ho is unstable and despite being a nuclear protein is exported to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation. We report here the molecular basis for the highly efficient nuclear import of Ho and the relation between its short half-life and passage through the nucleus. The Ho nuclear import machinery is functionally redundant, being based on two bipartite nuclear localization signals, recognized by four importins of the ribosomal import system. Ho degradation is regulated by the DNA damage response and Ho retained in the cytoplasm is stabilized, implying that Ho acquires its crucial degradation signals in the nucleus. Ho arose by domestication of a fungal VMA1 intein. A comparison of the primary sequences of Ho and fungal VMA1 inteins shows that the Ho nuclear localization signals are highly conserved in all Ho proteins, but are absent from VMA1 inteins. Thus adoption of a highly efficient import strategy occurred very early in the evolution of Ho. This may have been a crucial factor in establishment of homothallism in yeast, and a key event in the rise of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto."
https://openalex.org/W2019829180,"Abasic (AP) sites are a threat to cellular viability and genomic integrity, since they impede transcription and DNA replication. In mammalian cells, DNA polymerase (pol) β plays an important role in the repair of AP sites. However, it is known that many organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster, do not have a pol β homologue, and it is unclear how they repair AP sites. Here, we screened for DNA polymerases that interact with the Drosophila AP endonuclease 1 homologue, Rrp1 (recombination repair protein 1), and found that Drosophila pol ζ (Dmpol ζ), DmREV3 and DmREV7 bound to Rrp1 in a protein affinity column. Rrp1 directly interacted with DmREV7 in vitro and in vivo but not with DmREV3. These findings suggest that the DNA polymerase partner for Rrp1 is Dmpol ζ and that this interaction occurs through DmREV7. Interestingly, DmREV7 bound to the N-terminal region of Rrp1, which has no known protein homologue, suggesting that this binding is a species-specific event. Moreover, DmREV7 could stimulate the AP endonuclease activity of Rrp1, but not the 3′-exonuclease activity, and form a homomultimer. DmREV3 could not incorporate nucleotides at the 5′-incised tetrahydrofran sites but did show strand displacement activity for one-nucleotide-gapped DNA, which was not influenced by either DmREV7 or Rrp1. Methyl methanesulfonate and hydrogen peroxide treatments increased mRNA levels of DmREV3 and DmREV7. On the basis of the direct interaction between DmREV7 and Rrp1, we suggest that Dmpol ζ may be involved in the repair pathway of AP sites in DNA. Abasic (AP) sites are a threat to cellular viability and genomic integrity, since they impede transcription and DNA replication. In mammalian cells, DNA polymerase (pol) β plays an important role in the repair of AP sites. However, it is known that many organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster, do not have a pol β homologue, and it is unclear how they repair AP sites. Here, we screened for DNA polymerases that interact with the Drosophila AP endonuclease 1 homologue, Rrp1 (recombination repair protein 1), and found that Drosophila pol ζ (Dmpol ζ), DmREV3 and DmREV7 bound to Rrp1 in a protein affinity column. Rrp1 directly interacted with DmREV7 in vitro and in vivo but not with DmREV3. These findings suggest that the DNA polymerase partner for Rrp1 is Dmpol ζ and that this interaction occurs through DmREV7. Interestingly, DmREV7 bound to the N-terminal region of Rrp1, which has no known protein homologue, suggesting that this binding is a species-specific event. Moreover, DmREV7 could stimulate the AP endonuclease activity of Rrp1, but not the 3′-exonuclease activity, and form a homomultimer. DmREV3 could not incorporate nucleotides at the 5′-incised tetrahydrofran sites but did show strand displacement activity for one-nucleotide-gapped DNA, which was not influenced by either DmREV7 or Rrp1. Methyl methanesulfonate and hydrogen peroxide treatments increased mRNA levels of DmREV3 and DmREV7. On the basis of the direct interaction between DmREV7 and Rrp1, we suggest that Dmpol ζ may be involved in the repair pathway of AP sites in DNA.

They are also formed by DNA glycosylases that remove damaged or incorrect bases (1Dianov G.L. Sleeth K.M. Dianova I.I. Allinson S.L. Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Reportedly, there are 50,000–200,000 AP sites per mammalian cell (2Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar). Unless they are rapidly repaired, they can impede transcription and DNA replication and consequently lead to genome instability and cell death. In mammalian cells, AP sites are mainly repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which contains two subpathways, short patch and long patch BER. Both subpathways are often initiated by AP endonuclease 1 (APE1), which cleaves more than 95% of cellular AP sites (3Chen D.S. Herman T. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In short patch BER, APE1 recruits DNA polymerase (pol) β to the nick with a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate group and a 3′-hydroxyl group. There, pol β catalyzes DNA synthesis and 5′-deoxyribose phosphate excision. DNA ligase then completes the repair of the AP sites by sealing pol β nicks. In long patch BER, pol β, δ, and ϵ carry out the strand displacement synthesis (2–10 nucleotides), and flap endonuclease 1 cleaves the 5′-protruding flaps. Finally, the nicks are resealed by DNA ligase in a fashion similar to short patch BER (4Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar).Most of the genes that code for mammalian BER proteins show conservation across a wide range of organisms. Pol β is an exception in that no homologue has been identified in any other organism (5Burgers P.M. Koonin E.V. Bruford E. Blanco L. Burtis K.C. Christman M.F. Copeland W.C. Friedberg E.C. Hanaoka F.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43487-43490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Yeast and higher plants contain pol β-like gene products, pol IV and pol λ, respectively, which are probably involved in BER (6Prasad R. Widen S.G. Singhal R.K. Watkins J. Prakash L. Wilson S.H.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 2799-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, a pol β homologue is absent in Drosophila melanogaster. Trf4, the only known member of the pol X family of proteins in Drosophila, is thought to be involved in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and RNA quality control (5Burgers P.M. Koonin E.V. Bruford E. Blanco L. Burtis K.C. Christman M.F. Copeland W.C. Friedberg E.C. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D.C. Lawrence C.W. Nakanishi M. Ohmori H. Prakash L. Prakash S. Reynaud C.A. Sugino A.

We therefore sought to determine which DNA polymerase is required for the repair of AP sites in Drosophila.Drosophila Rrp1 (recombination repair protein 1) belongs to the Escherichia coli exonuclease III family (12Sander M. Lowenhaupt K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6780-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 252-amino acid region of Rrp1 shows high homology with exonuclease III and human APE1 and possesses AP endonuclease, 3′-exonuclease, 3′-phosphatase, and 3′-phosphodiesterase activities. In contrast, the N-terminal 421-amino acid region is not homologous to any known protein and shows the unique in vitro characteristics of DNA strand transfer and single-stranded DNA renaturation (13Sander M. Huang S.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A previous study suggested that Rrp1 was involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage in vivo (14Szakmary A. Huang S.M. Chang D.T. Beachy P.A. Sander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but little is known of its possible role in this type of repair. Therefore, we hypothesized that Rrp1 recruits DNA polymerases, such as APE1 (15Bennett R.A. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), that participate in the repair of incised AP sites.We sought to identify DNA polymerases that bind to Rrp1 using a GST-tagged Rrp1-conjugated affinity (Rrp1 protein affinity) column and found that Drosophila DNA polymerase ζ (Dmpol ζ) can interact with Rrp1. Pol ζ consists of the catalytic subunit REV3, which belongs to the B-family of DNA polymerases, and REV7 (16Lawrence C.W. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Yeast pol ζ has the biochemical ability to extend from mismatched termini opposite various DNA lesions and plays major roles in most of the spontaneous and DNA damage-induced mutations (16Lawrence C.W. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 17Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Human and mouse pol ζ are not only thought to participate in mutagenesis and somatic hypermutation but are also essential for early embryonic development (18Bemark M. Khamlichi A.A. Davies S.L.

However, Drosophila REV3 (DmREV3) does not appear to participate in mutagenesis and cannot extend mispaired termini in (6–4)-photoproducts in vitro (16Lawrence C.W.

Here, we report that DmREV7, the accessory subunit of Dmpol ζ, directly interacts with Rrp1 and stimulates the AP endonuclease activity of Rrp1. We also discuss the potential role of Dmpol ζ in repair of AP sites in association with Rrp1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[α-32P]dTTP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B, HiTrap Heparin HP, and Resource S were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Bradford reagents and molecular mass markers for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad. DmREV3 and recombinant Rattus norvegicus pol β were purified as described in our previous report (26Takeuchi R. Oshige M. Uchida M. Ishikawa G. Takata K. Shimanouchi K. Kanai Y. Ruike T. Morioka H. Sakaguchi K. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All other reagents were analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma, Amersham Biosciences, or Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan).Collection of D. melanogaster Embryos—The basic procedures for the collection of Drosophila embryos have been described previously (27Harris P.V. Boyd J.B. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos of D. melanogaster (Oregon R and M316) from 0 to 24 h of age were collected from large population cages.Expression and Purification of Rrp1—Rrp1 cDNA fragments were isolated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from cultured Kc cells using primers based on sequences obtained from the Drosophila Genome data base (available on the World Wide Web at flybase.net/). The full-length Rrp1 coding region was cloned into the pGEX 6P-1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). One colony was incubated in 10 ml of LB medium containing 1% (w/v) glucose and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown overnight at 30 °C and transferred into 1 liter of fresh LB medium containing 1% (w/v) glucose and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown at this temperature until the A600 value reached 0.4, at which point they were incubated on ice for 1 h. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.1 mm, and the culture continued at 30 °C for 3 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Frozen cells were resuspended in 50 ml of TEMG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml each pepstatin A and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 0.4 m NaCl, sonicated 5 times for 30 s, and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column pre-equilibrated with TEMG buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl and extensively washed with TEMG buffer containing 2 m NaCl. Rrp1 protein with a GST tag (GST-Rrp1) was eluted from the column with TEMG buffer (adjusted to pH 8.0) containing 3 mg/ml glutathione (reduced form). The purified GST-Rrp1 was dialyzed against TEMG buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. To obtain Rrp1 without GST tag (Rrp1), 40 units of PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the column after equilibration with digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). After incubation at 4 °C for 4 h, Rrp1 dissociated from the column was collected and loaded onto a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-300 column pre-equilibrated with S-300 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The peak fraction (1 ml) of Rrp1 was dialyzed against TEMG buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. The molecular mass was estimated from a calibration curve with ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), adolase (158 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa).To express GST fusion proteins containing either the N-terminal 400-amino acid or C-terminal 273-amino acid regions of Rrp1 (GST-Rrp1N and GST-Rrp1C, respectively), cDNA fragments containing the N-terminal or C-terminal residues were amplified using full-length Rrp1 cDNA as the template and cloned into pGEX 6P-1 expression vectors. We induced expression of the vectors and then purified the GST-Rrp1N and GST-Rrp1C proteins as well as GST-Rrp1 protein.Expression and Purification of DmREV7—Recovery of the T7-tagged DmREV7 (T7-DmREV7) from the soluble fraction was carried out by first digesting the expression plasmid containing DmREV7 (26Takeuchi R. Oshige M. Uchida M. Ishikawa G. Takata K. Shimanouchi K. Kanai Y. Ruike T. Morioka H. Sakaguchi K. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with NdeI and XhoI and then inserting the NdeI/XhoI DNA fragment into the pColdI vector (TaKaRa Bio Inc.). BL21 (DE3), harboring the pColdI plasmid containing T7-DmREV7, was incubated in 20 ml of LB medium containing 1% (w/v) glucose and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown overnight at 37 °C and transferred into 2 liters of fresh LB medium containing 1% (w/v) glucose and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were further grown at the same temperature until the A600 value reached 0.3 and incubated at 15 °C for 1 h. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.1 mm, and the incubation was continued at 15 °C for 20 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Frozen cells were resuspended in 50 ml of His buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml each pepstatin A and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 8.0)) supplemented with 10 mm imidazole, sonicated 5 times for 30 s, and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with His buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, washed thoroughly with His buffer containing 30 mm imidazole, and eluted with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml each pepstatin A and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.7)). The fractions containing T7-DmREV7 were loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin HP column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with TEMG buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, and washed with the same buffer. T7-DmREV7 was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–1.0 m NaCl in TEMG buffer, dialyzed against TEMG buffer supplemented with 50 mm NaCl, and loaded onto a Resource S column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with TEMG buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. After washing with the same buffer, T7-DmREV7 was eluted with a linear gradient of 50–800 mm NaCl in TEMG buffer. The purified T7-DmREV7 was dialyzed against TEMG buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use.Polyclonal Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against Drosophila pol δ, pol ϵ, and REV3 were obtained as described previously (26Takeuchi R. Oshige M. Uchida M. Ishikawa G. Takata K. Shimanouchi K. Kanai Y. Ruike T. Morioka H. Sakaguchi K. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against DmREV7 was obtained by expressing and purifying T7-DmREV7 as described above and using this protein to immunize mice.Rrp1 Protein Affinity Chromatography—Eight nmol of GST or GST-Rrp1 was loaded onto 300 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B and washed with 6 ml of TEMG buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Frozen Drosophila embryos (2 g) were crushed in a Waring-type blender running at maximum speed, and the material was suspended in 10 ml of TEMG buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. The embryo suspension was then homogenized with an LH-21 homogenizer (Yamato, Tokyo, Japan), filtered through two layers of nylon mesh, and sonicated and then centrifuged for 60 min at 50,000 × g at 4 °C. Twenty-five mg of the supernatant was loaded onto each affinity column and washed with TEMG buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. After equilibration with digestion buffer, the columns were incubated with 20 units of PreScission Protease for 4 h at 4 °C. Material dissociated from the affinity columns was collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To confirm the amount of GST protein conjugated to each column, GST proteins were eluted with TEMG buffer (adjusted to pH 8.0) containing 3 mg/ml glutathione and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GST tag polyclonal antibody.In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—GST-Rrp1, GST-Rrp1N, GST-Rrp1C, and GST (0.5 nmol of each) were separately incubated with 0.5 nmol of T7-DmREV7 on ice for 30 min in TEGN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40), and mixed with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B in 100 μl of the same buffer. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the beads were washed with the same buffer and mixed with 4 units of PreScission protease in digestion buffer. After incubation for 4 h at 4 °C, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against the T7 epitope tag (Novagen). To confirm the amount of GST conjugated to the beads, the eluted fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-GST tag polyclonal antibody. Conversely, 0.2 nmol of GST-Rrp1, 2.5 μl of anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody, and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose were incubated with or without 0.2 nmol of T7-DmREV7 in TEGN buffer for 90 min. The beads were washed with the same buffer and eluted by boiling in 1× SDS sample buffer. The bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-GST tag polyclonal antibody and an anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody.In Vivo Co-immunoprecipitation—The N-terminally HA-tagged Rrp1 and FLAG-tagged DmREV7 cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into pAc5.1/V5-His A vectors (Invitrogen). Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells were grown in Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 27 °C and transfected with pAc5.1 vectors containing both HA-Rrp1 and FLAG-DmREV7. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated with dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate 2HCl (Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h to cross-link proteins. They were resuspended in TEGN buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C. Two mg of the cell lysate and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose were incubated with a monoclonal antibody against FLAG (M2; Sigma), HA (3F10; Roche Applied Science), or T7 epitope tag at 4 °C for 4 h. After washing with the same buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies.Nuclease Assay—The DNA substrates are shown in Table 1. The F-1 oligomer containing tetrahydrofran (F) and the U-1 oligomer were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 nm radiolabeled substrate, and the proper proteins. The amounts of protein used are given in the figure legends. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, reactions were terminated with 20 μl of the loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 95% (v/v) formamide, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.1% (w/v) xylenecyanol), and the products were subjected to polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. After drying, the gels were exposed to BioMax MS-1 (Eastman Kodak Co.) and quantified using a BAS-3000 image analyzer (Fuji Film).TABLE ISequences of DNA substrates used in this study The asterisk indicates the position of the 32P label. p,5′-phosphate. Open table in a new tab DNA Polymerase Assay—To examine DNA synthesis of the template-primer containing the 5′-incised F residue, the 21F substrate without 32P label (see Table 1) was incubated with an excess of Rrp1 and then precipitated with ethanol (incised 21F). The reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 μm each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 10 μCi/ml [α-32P]dTTP, 5 nm incised 21F, and the proper proteins. The amounts of protein in each reaction are described in the figure legends. After incubation at 37 °C, samples were precipitated twice with ethanol and resuspended in the loading buffer. The reaction products were subjected to 8 m urea in a 20% acrylamide gel, and the gel was exposed to BioMax MS-1 (Eastman Kodak Co.).We tested DNA synthesis activities in nicked, one-nucleotide-gapped DNA and in recessed DNA with 3′ G/C (Table 1). The U-1 oligomer was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 50 mm NaCl; 1 mm DTT; 5 mm MgCl2; 10% (v/v) glycerol; 100 μm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP; 5 nm radiolabeled template-primer; and the proper proteins. The amounts of protein used in the reactions are described in the figure legends. After incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated with 20 μl of the loading buffer, and the products were subjected to 8 m urea in a 10% acrylamide gel. After drying, the gel was exposed to BioMax MS-1 (Kodak) and quantified by a BAS-3000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Film).RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs were extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) from whole animals at each developmental stage and from S2 cells exposed to 0.005% (v/v) methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), 1.5 mm H2O2, or 20 J/m2 UV. The RNAs were treated with DNase I (TaKaRa Bio, Inc.) to remove traces of genomic DNA contamination. First strand cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript II first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) and amplified using the following primers: Rrp1,5′-AAGAAGGAAGGCAAGGAGCC-3′ and 5′-CGTGTATGGGCATTATCTTG-3′; DmREV3,5′-TTCGAATCGGCGAGGAGATC-3′ and 5′-TTCAGCGGCGGAATAATCGC-3′; DmREV7, 5′-ATGCAGGCGGAGATTAAGGC-3′ and 5′-CTGAAGCCAGGGAAACTCCT-3′; Actin5C (as an internal control), 5′-TGTGGATACTCCTCCCGACA-3′ and 5′-ATCCCGATCCTGATCCTCTT-3′. For Rrp1, DmREV3, and DmREV7, the PCR conditions were 95 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 35 s, after a predenaturation step of 2 min 30 s at 95 °C. Twenty-one amplification cycles were used for Rrp1, 25 cycles for DmREV3, and 29 or 24 cycles for DmREV7. For the Actin5C control, amplification was carried out, after a predenaturation step of 2 min 30 s at 95 °C, using 17 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min 5 s. PCR products were visualized by staining with SYBR Safe (Invitrogen).RESULTSDrosophila DNA Polymerase ζ Binds to Rrp1 Protein Affinity Beads—Drosophila cells contain eight types of DNA polymerase, pol α, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ, η, θ, and ι. However, they do not have a mammalian pol β-like gene product (5Burgers P.M. Koonin E.V. Bruford E. Blanco L. Burtis K.C. Christman M.F. Copeland W.C. Friedberg E.C. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D.C. Lawrence C.W. Nakanishi M. Ohmori H. Prakash L. Prakash S. Reynaud C.A. Sugino A. Todo T. Wang Z. Weill J.C. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43487-43490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To investigate how AP sites in Drosophila DNA are repaired without pol β, we used protein-protein affinity chromatography to identify DNA polymerases that interact with Rrp1, the Drosophila homologue of APE1. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the open reading frame region of Rrp1 was isolated by RT-PCR from a cDNA library of cultured Kc cells and cloned into the pGEX 6P-1 vector. GST-tagged protein (GST-Rrp1) was produced by overexpression of the vector in transformed bacteria. Next, we conjugated equal amounts of purified GST-Rrp1 or GST alone to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Crude extracts of Drosophila embryos were loaded onto these beads, and proteins were eluted by digestion with PreScission Protease after extensive washing (see “Experimental Procedures”). The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 1A). Several bands were observed in the fraction eluted from Rrp1 protein affinity beads (lane 2), whereas there was no band in the elution product from GST-conjugated beads (lane 1). Since the GST-Rrp1 conjugated to the beads was purified to near homogeneity (data not shown), the presence of several bands in the elution product from Rrp1 protein affinity beads suggests that other proteins may physically interact with Rrp1. Therefore, we carried out Western blotting with antibodies against several Drosophila DNA polymerases in order to identify those bound to the beads. A sharp signal was found with anti-DmREV3 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1B). Since we previously demonstrated that DmREV3 and DmREV7 interact in vitro (26Takeuchi R. Oshige M. Uchida M. Ishikawa G. Takata K. Shimanouchi K. Kanai Y. Ruike T. Morioka H. Sakaguchi K. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we applied anti-DmREV7 polyclonal antibody to the Western blot to investigate whether DmREV7 also bound to Rrp1 protein affinity beads. We found that both DmREV7 and DmREV3 were present (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that Dmpol ζ is involved in the complex with Rrp1. Additionally, no bands were detected with antibodies against Drosophila pol δ and ϵ (data not shown), whereas mammalian pol δ and ϵ are implicated in the long patch BER pathway (1Dianov G.L. Sleeth K.M. Dianova I.I. Allinson S.L. Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).DmREV7 Directly Interacts with Rrp1 both in Vitro and in Vivo—To examine how Dmpol ζ interacts with Rrp1, we first performed a GST pull-down assay. We conjugated GST-Rrp1 or GST alone to glutathi-one-Sepharose beads and incubated the beads with Dmpol ζ subunit, T7-tagged DmREV7 (T7-DmREV7), or DmREV3. T7-DmREV7 bound to GST-Rrp1 (Fig. 2A), but DmREV3 did not (data not shown). Conversely, GST-Rrp1 was precipitated with anti-T7 monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads in the presence of T7-DmREV7 but not in its absence (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2DmREV7 interacts with Rrp1 in vitro and in v"

The single chain variable region fragment of antibody 2F3 (scFv2F3) was elicited against hapten GSH-S-DN2phBu, a conjugate of glutathione (GSH), butyl alcohol, and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB); it can therefore bind both GSH and CDNB, the substrates of native glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). It was shown previously that there is a serine residue that is the catalytic group of GST in the CDR regions of scFv2F3 close to the sulfhydryl of GSH. Thus, we anticipated that scFv2F3 will display GST activity. The experimental results showed that scFv2F3 indeed displayed GST activity that is equivalent to the rat θ-class GST T-2-2 and exhibited pH- and temperature-dependent catalytic activity. Steady-state kinetic studies showed that the Km values for the substrates are close to those of native GSTs, indicating that scFv2F3 has strong affinities for the substrates. Compared with some other GSTs, its kcat value was found to be low, which could be caused by the similarity between the GSH-S-DN2phBu and the reaction product of GSH and CDNB. These results showed that our approach to imitating enzymes is correct, which is that an active site may catalyze a chemical reaction when a catalytic group locates beside a substrate-binding site of a receptor. It is important to consider product inhibition in hapten design in order to obtain a mimic with a high catalytic efficiency.

It is important to consider product inhibition in hapten design in order to obtain a mimic with a high catalytic efficiency. The generation of enzyme-like catalysts continues to be a fundamental goal for biochemists. Imitation of enzymes is helpful not only for understanding how enzymes work but also for obtaining practical catalysts. Natural enzymes catalyze biochemical reactions by binding one or two small molecules into an active site, with a catalytic group held nearby so as to interact effectively with the bound substrate molecule. Therefore, our opinion is that an active site may catalyze a chemical reaction when a catalytic group locates near a substrate-binding site of a receptor. Moreover, we have developed an approach to imitate enzymes, based on introducing a catalytic group into a receptor with a substrate-binding site to create an active site capable of catalyzing a chemical reaction. The ability to create novel active sites in this way permits us to systematically explore the basic principles of biological catalysis and to evaluate alternative catalytic pathways for particular reactions by comparing with native enzymes. So far, we have successfully generated some mimics with high glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 2The abbreviations used are: GPX, glutathione peroxidase; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; GSH, glutathione; scFv, single chain variable region fragments of antibodies; Se-scFv, selenium-containing scFv; GSH-S-DN2phBu, GSH-dinitrophenyl butinyl ester; GST, glutathione S-transferase; rGST T2-2, rat θ-class GST T-2-2; CuOOH, cumene hydroperoxide. activity by this approach (1Sun Y.

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs, EC 2.5.1.18) are a superfamily of multifunctional enzymes involved in cellular detoxification by conjugating the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) to a wide range of endobiotic and xenobiotic electrophilic compounds (12Dirr H.W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 13Wilce M.C. Board P.G. Feil S.C. Parker M.W.

According to sequence, immunological, kinetic, and tertiary/quaternary structural properties, GSTs are grouped in at least 10 independent classes (15Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). In the active site of GSTs, the catalytic residue is typically either Tyr or Ser, presumed to act by inducing and stabilizing a reactive thiolate at the conjugating sulfur of the GSH substrate (14Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 15Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). To generate a substrate-binding site, one of the general strategies is standard monoclonal antibody preparation technique because the characteristic binding specificity of antibodies offers mimics the potential for unique substrate selectivity. The single chain variable region fragment of antibody (scFv) is a recombinant polypeptide consisting of a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region joined by a short peptide linker. It is the smallest antibody fragment that consistently maintains the binding specificity and affinity of the whole antibody (16Glockshuber R. Malia M. Pfitzinger I. Pluckthun A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody 2F3 was elicited against the hapten GSH-S-DN2phBu, which is a conjugate of GSH, butyl alcohol, and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (5Su D. Ren X.J. You D.L. Li D. Mu Y. Yan G.L. Zhang Y. Luo G.M. Xue Y. Shen J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The single chain antibody scFv2F3, whose amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 1, was obtained from monoclonal antibody 2F3 (6Ren X.J. Gao S.J. You D.L. Huang H.L. Liu Z. Mu Y. Liu J.Q. Zhang Y. Yan G.L. Luo G.M. Yang T.S. Shen J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 369-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it can bind both GSH (17Su D. You D.L. Ren X.J. Luo G.M. Mu Y. Yan G.L. Xue Y. Shen J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and CDNB, which are substrates of native GSTs (Scheme 1). It was further converted to selenium-containing scFv2F3 (Se-scFv2F3) by chemical mutation (6Ren X.J. Gao S.J. You D.L. Huang H.L. Liu Z. Mu Y. Liu J.Q. Zhang Y. Yan G.L. Luo G.M. Yang T.S. Shen J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 369-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulation studies of Se-scFv2F3 show that the chemical modification site of Se-scFv2F3 is SerH52, which is close to the sulfhydryl of GSH (18Zhang Y. Li Z.S. Sun M. Zheng Q.C. Sun C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1747: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, we anticipate the single chain antibody would display GST activity because it has both a substrate-binding site and a potentially catalytic group, which are collocated properly. Here we have reported the enzymic properties and kinetic behaviors of the scFv2F3 and discussed the importance of Ser as the catalytic residue of scFv2F3, as well as product inhibition and hapten design.SCHEME 1The reaction of glutathione S-transferase catalyzing GSH conjugated to CDNB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Materials—CDNB and cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH) were obtained from Sigma. Glutathione reductase (type III baker's yeast) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. NADPH was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Reduced glutathione and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene were obtained from Aldrich. All other reagents were of analytic grade. Preparation of scFv2F3—ScFv2F3 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (6Ren X.J. Gao S.J. You D.L. Huang H.L. Liu Z. Mu Y. Liu J.Q. Zhang Y. Yan G.L. Luo G.M. Yang T.S. Shen J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 369-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, monoclonal 2F3 was elicited against the hapten (5Su D. Ren X.J. You D.L. Li D. Mu Y. Yan G.L. Zhang Y. Luo G.M. Xue Y. Shen J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Its VH and VL genes were cloned and sequenced from hybridoma 2F3 and used to construct the scFv2F3 by protein engineering. Assay of Enzyme Activities—The specific activities of GST toward CDNB and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene were measured according to published methods (19Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). The activity of GST toward CDNB was measured in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm CDNB, and 1 mm GSH. The activity of GST toward 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene was measured in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, and 5 mm GSH. The reactions were conducted at 25 °C in a total volume of 0.7 ml. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of scFv2F3 that produces 1 μmol of product min-1 at 25 °C. The specific activity is expressed in μmol·min-1·mg-1 of protein. The GPX activities were assayed as described with the coupled assay by Wilson et al. (20Wilson S.R. Zucker P.A. Huang R.R.C. Spector A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5936-5939Crossref Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 0.7 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, 1 mm GSH, 1 unit of GSH reductase, and 10-50 nm protein. The mixture was preincubated for 7 min. Then 0.25 mm NADPH solution was added, and the mixture was incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mm H2O2 or 1.5 mm CuOOH. The activities were determined from the decrease of NADPH absorption at 340 nm. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of protein that catalyzes the turnover of 1 μmol NADPH/min. The specific activity is expressed in μmol·min-1·mg-1 of protein. The absorbance value was read on a UV-3100 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). All initial rates were corrected for the background nonenzymatic reaction. The concentration of protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with crystalline bovine serum albumin as a standard. The Mutation of Ser Residues in scFv2F3—Sodium hydroselenide was prepared according to the method described (22Klayman D.L. Griffin T.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 197-199Crossref Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The mutation of Ser residues in scFv2F3 was performed according to Ref. 6Ren X.J. Gao S.J. You D.L. Huang H.L. Liu Z. Mu Y. Liu J.Q. Zhang Y. Yan G.L. Luo G.M. Yang T.S. Shen J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 369-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, 0.5 mg of scFv2F3 was dissolved in 2 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0; 20 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride solution (20 mg/ml acetonitrile) was added and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. The sulfonylated scFv2F3 was flushed using pure nitrogen for 20 min and then treated with 10 μl of 1 m sodium hydroselenide for 36 h at 35 °C. The crude reaction mixture was purified first by centrifugation and then loaded on a Sephadex G-25 column and eluted with buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0). The active fractions were pooled and finally freeze dried to obtain Se-scFv2F3. Determination of Optimal pH and Optimal Temperature for ScFv2F3 Catalysis—The optimal pH and optimal temperature of GST (CDNB) activity of scFv2F3 were measured with the same method as the GST (CDNB) activity assay. The initial rates were measured at the concentrations of 1 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB. The pH value of buffer was changed in determining the initial rates of the reaction to obtain the optimal pH condition for scFv2F3-catalyzed reaction. Similarly, the optimal temperature for scFv2F3-catalyzed reaction was determined at different temperatures. Steady-state Kinetics of ScFv2F3—All kinetic experiments were performed in the same way as GST activity assay. The initial rates were measured by observing the increase of product absorption at 340 nm at several concentrations of one substrate while the concentration of the other substrate was fixed. GSH concentrations were varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mm; CDNB concentrations were also varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mm. The uncatalytic reaction affecting the measurement of the initial rate was taken into account and subtracted to obtain exact kinetic values. Kinetic data were analyzed by double reciprocal plotting. Enzyme Activities of ScFv2F3—Using CDNB and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene as substrates we assayed the GST activities of scFv2F3, which were found to be 0.997 and 3.646 units/mg, respectively, and equivalent to the rat θ-class GST T-2-2 (rGST T2-2). The GPX activity of scFv2F3 to CuOOH is 0.928 units/mg, but scFv2F3 did not exhibit GPX activity to H2O2. However, after scFv2F3 converted into Se-scFv2F3 by chemical mutation, Se-scFv2F3 did not display any GST activity but exhibited a high GPX activity to CuOOH or H2O2 (6Ren X.J. Gao S.J. You D.L.

Its GST activity toward CDNB was 0.9 units/mg, and its GPX activity to CuOOH was 2.1 units/mg, but it had no GPX activity to H2O2. After chemical mutation, rGST T2-2 was converted into Se-rGST T2-2. It then lost GST activity and gained a high GPX activity to CuOOH or H2O2 (4Ren X.J. Jemth P. Board P.G. Luo G.M. Mannervik B. Liu J.Q. Zhang K. Shen J.C. Chem.

For scFv2F3 catalyzing the conjugation of GSH with CDNB, the optimal pH was found to be 7.9 and the optimal temperature was found to be 44 °C. The GST (CDNB) activity of scFv2F3 at pH 6.5 is only 32.02% of that at pH 7.65. The activity of scFv2F3 at 25 °C is only 57.18% of that at 45 °C and at 60 °C only 5.58%. Above 55 °C it decreased rapidly, indicating that the structure of scFv2F3 is not steady under high temperatures. Steady-state Kinetics of ScFv2F3—The initial velocities catalyzed by scFv2F3 for the conjugation of GSH with CDNB were determined as a function of substrate concentration, varying one substrate concentration while the other was fixed. Double reciprocal plots of the initial velocity versus substrate concentration showed a family of convergent lines for both substrates. The results are shown in Fig. 3, and the apparent kinetic parameters are listed in Table 3. With the concentration of CDNB increased from 0.1 to 1.0 mm, the apparent Michaelis constant KmGSH increased little, only from 0.2752 to 0.3325 mm, but the first-order rate constant kcat increased obviously, from 5.604 to 41.77 min-1, and the apparent second-order constant kcat/KmGSH increased about one order of magnitude, from 20.36 to 125.9 mm-1 min-1 (see Table 3). The same changes happened to KmCDNB, kcat and kcat/KmCDNB while the concentrations of GSH increased. These parameters showed that the changes of substrate concentrations had almost no effect on Km but greatly affected kcat and kcat/Km.TABLE 3Apparent kinetic parameters for the GST (CDNB) activity of scFv2F3 Reactions were carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at 25 °C.

KmGSH and KmCDNB of scFv2F3 are close to those of some native GSTs, indicating scFv2F3 has strong affinities to both GSH and CDNB. Then, which amino acid residue is the catalytic residue of scFv2F3? The experimental result showed that when scFv2F3 was converted into Se-scFv2F3 by chemical mutation of hydroxyl groups in the Ser residues of scFv2F3, it lost all GST activities and gained a high GPX activity to CuOOH or H2O2 (6Ren X.J. Gao S.J. You D.L. Huang H.L. Liu Z. Mu Y. Liu J.Q. Zhang Y. Yan G.L. Luo G.M. Yang T.S. Shen J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 369-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that Ser in scFv2F3 could greatly contribute to GPX activity (4Ren X.J. Jemth P. Board P.G. Luo G.M. Mannervik B. Liu J.Q. Zhang K. Shen J.C. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 789-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, some Ser in scFv2F3 is the residue that can catalyze conjugation of GSH to electrophilic compounds. Moreover, according to the three-dimensional structure of Se-scFv2F3 built by means of homology modeling, the chemical modification site of scFv2F3 is SerH52, and a hydrogen bond can be formed between the selenol group of the modified SerH52 and the sulfhydryl group of GSH (18Zhang Y. Li Z.S. Sun M. Zheng Q.C. Sun C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1747: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). That is, the hydroxyl of the SerH52 is juxtaposed to the sulfhydryl group of GSH, and a certain chemical reaction can occur between them. Therefore, the 52nd amino acid residue is the catalytic residue of scFv2F3. Whether scFv2F3 exhibits GST or GPX activity depends on whether oxygen or selenium is present in the side chain of the 52nd amino acid residue. The difference of only one atom led to the conversion of biological activities of scFv2F3, which suggests that GST and GPX are consanguineous. In previous studies, it has been proposed that GST and GPX have a “glutathione-binding protein” ancestor based on the similarities in their overall structures and the positioning of their important active site residues despite their functional differences and low sequence identity (14Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 29Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Considering the mechanism of seleno-protein synthesis in organisms (30Jiang Z.H. Mu Y. Li W.J. Yan G.L. Luo G.M. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2002; 34: 395-399Google Scholar, 31Stadtman T.C. Annu.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it is very possible that they evolved from the same ancestor and separately developed different functions to accommodate to the constantly changing environment. From Table 3, we can see that the changes in substrate concentrations have almost no effect on the Km of substrates, indicating that the affinities of scFv2F3 to GSH and CDNB changed little and the structure of the scFv2F3 active site cannot change flexibly. Therefore, the kcat/Km of one substrate increased as the concentration of another substrate increased. Because kcat/Km means the selectivity of enzyme to substrate, the higher the CDNB concentration the stronger the selectivity of scFv2F3 to GSH and vice versa. KmGSH is less than KmCDNB, so scFv2F3 shows better selectivity to GSH than to CDNB when their concentrations are the same. From Table 5, we can see that the kcat of scFv2F3 is very low. Even compared with that of Lucilia GST whose catalytic residue is serine, it is one order of magnitude lower. This mainly results from the high structure similarity between hapten GSH-S-DN2phBu and the product of GSH conjugated with CDNB (Fig. 4). Because scFv2F3 was cloned from monoclonal antibody 2F3, which was elicited against hapten GSH-S-DN2phBu, scFv2F3 has a strong affinity to GSH-S-DN2phBu. Because the structure of the product of GSH conjugated with CDNB has only a small difference from that of GSH-S-DN2phBu, scFv2F3 can bind the product too strongly to release from it. Therefore, the reaction velocity is delayed, and the kcat of scFv2F3 catalyzing GSH conjugated to CDNB is low. The process of an enzymatic reaction usually is divided in three steps: binding its substrate, catalytic reaction, and releasing its product. A naturally occurring enzyme, after a long period of evolution, has formed a fine and ingenious system to accomplish catalysis. When an enzyme binds its substrate, its active site shape changes to create a shape into which the substrate fits. In the same way, the shape of the active site changes to release the product as soon as the product is produced. The rapid change of the shape of the active site ensures that an enzyme can bind the substrate and release the product continuously, which endows enzymes with great catalytic efficiency. However, most mimics are not as dynamic and flexible as native enzymes and do not have such a perfect system to recognize substrates and products. In particular, the shape of the active site of mimic cannot change continuously to bind its substrate and release its product. In this experiment, the binding site of scFv2F3 induced by hapten GSH-S-DN2phBu has strong affinities to the two substrates and makes their active groups adjacent in space, which is advantageous to the conjugate reaction. In addition, fortunately there is a Ser as the catalytic residue of scFv2F3, which is juxtaposed to the sulfhydryl group of GSH. Therefore, scFv2F3 exhibits GST activities. This result indicates that our approach on imitating enzymes is correct. However, the catalytic capability of scFv2F3 and Se-scFv2F3 are much different, though the only difference between them is their catalytic groups. The GST activities of scFv2F3 are not high. On the contrary, Se-scFv2F3 showed a very high GPX activity, even much higher than native GPX from rabbit liver (6Ren X.J. Gao S.J. You D.L. Huang H.L. Liu Z. Mu Y. Liu J.Q. Zhang Y. Yan G.L. Luo G.M. Yang T.S. Shen J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 369-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons are that GSH-S-DN2phBu and the reaction product of GSH and CDNB are very similar and scFv2F3 binds the product too tightly to release it rapidly. However, neither the substrates nor the products in the reaction Se-scFv2F3 catalyzed are as similar as those in the reaction scFv2F3 catalyzed to GSH-S-DN2phBu; in the active site there is enough room for the substrates entering and the products leaving, which improves the catalytic velocity. Therefore, it is important to consider product inhibition in hapten design in order to obtain an abzyme with a highly catalytic efficiency. Considering the affinity of antibody to antigen and the structure rigidity of abzymes, when we design a hapten to elicit a catalytic antibody we should consider not only its affinity to its substrate but also its dissociation with its product. By hapten redesign, a bigger active site could be obtained that will provide more room for product leaving from it to avoid product inhibition."

In this issue of Neuron, Peng et al. propose that CREB-dependent downregulation of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR2, resulting in defective Q/R editing of AMPA receptor GluR2 subunits and increased availability of calcium and zinc-permeable death-promoting AMPA receptors, underlies the vulnerability of some neuronal populations to ischemia.

Stroke, because of occlusion or rupture of an artery, is a leading cause of death or infirmity in developed countries. In stroke, lack of blood flow to the brain (ischemia) results in excessive release of the neurotransmitter glutamate into the extracellular space. For over two decades, it has been known that this glutamate release activates ionotropic glutamate receptors, causing calcium entry, excitotoxicity, and neuronal death in vulnerable brain regions (Simon et al., 1984Simon R.P. Swan J.H. Griffiths T. Meldrum B.S. Science. 1984; 226: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, Szatkowski and Attwell, 1994Szatkowski M. Attwell D.

Neurosci. 2003; 4: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). What has thus far remained less clear is the specific role of different types of Ca2+-permeable glutamate receptor in precipitating cell death and why neurons in some regions of the brain, including hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, striatal spiny neurons, and cortical projection neurons, are more vulnerable to glutamate mediated excitotoxicity (Simon et al., 1984Simon R.P. Swan J.H. Griffiths T. Meldrum B.S. Science. 1984; 226: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, Pellegrini-Giampietro et al., 1997Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Gorter J.A. Bennett M.V.

Neurosci. 2003; 4: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system (CNS), activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors allows a rapid influx of ions across the neuronal membrane, mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are also critical for synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. However, excessive activation of glutamate receptors in pathological conditions, such as anoxia or ischemia, precipitates excitotoxic neuronal death in vulnerable neuronal types by allowing an excessive influx of Ca2+, Na+, and Zn2+ ions into the cell (Lo et al., 2003Lo E.H. Dalkara T. Moskowitz M.A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). There are three main classes of ionotropic glutamate receptor: NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors. Because all NMDA receptors are permeable to calcium, initial studies focused on the role of these receptors in ischemic injury (Simon et al., 1984Simon R.P. Swan J.H. Griffiths T. Meldrum B.S. Science. 1984; 226: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, Lo et al., 2003Lo E.H. Dalkara T. Moskowitz M.A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). More recently, however, attention has turned to a critical role that is also played by Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors. AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are heteromeric assemblies of subunits GluR1– GluR4. AMPARs lacking GluR2 subunits are permeable to Ca2+ and Zn2+, can be blocked by intracellular polyamines, and exhibit an inwardly rectifying current-voltage (I-V) relation. Ca2+-impermeability in GluR2-containing receptors is specified by the presence of an arginine (R) residue in transmembrane domain 2 of this subunit instead of the glutamine residue (Q) present in the GluR1, GluR3, and GluR4 subunits. Although the vast majority of GluR2 subunits in the brain contain arginine at this site, this information is not encoded at the genomic level but is the result of RNA editing of the GluR2 pre-mRNA in the nucleus by the enzyme adenosine deaminase 2 (ADAR2), which catalyzes site-selective deamination of adenosine in the genomic glutamine codon (CAG) to an inosine, giving an arginine codon (CIG) in the mRNA (Seeburg and Hartner, 2003Seeburg P.H. Hartner J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This position is normally nearly 100% edited in the brain, and so the vast majority of GluR2-containing AMPARs in the CNS contain GluR2(R) and are Ca2+-impermeable. In addition, Q/R editing also influences assembly, membrane trafficking, and synaptic targeting of GluR2-containing receptors (Seeburg and Hartner, 2003Seeburg P.H. Hartner J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Greger et al., 2003Greger I.H. Khatri L. Kong X. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2003; 40: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Two other ADAR enzymes exist in mammals (ADAR1 and ADAR3), but they play a negligible role in generating edited GluR2 subunits (Seeburg and Hartner, 2003Seeburg P.H. Hartner J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The observation that GluR2 mRNA and protein are specifically reduced in vulnerable CA1 pyramidal neurons after transient ischemia led to the “GluR2 hypothesis,” which proposed that decreased availability of Ca2+-impermeable GluR2(R) protein after a neurological insult would lead to increased formation of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs and consequently increased neurotoxic Ca2+ (and possibly Zn2+) influx (Pellegrini-Giampietro et al., 1997Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Gorter J.A. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, Lu and coworkers recently demonstrated that AMPARs in CA1 pyramidal cells exhibit an 18-fold greater permeability to Ca2+ after an ischemic insult (Pellegrini-Giampietro et al., 1997Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E.

In addition, using viral vectors to express either GluR2(R) or GluR2(Q) in the hippocampus in vivo, Liu et al., 2004Liu S. Lau L. Wei J. Zhu D. Zou S. Sun H.S. Fu Y. Liu F. Lu Y. Neuron. 2004; 43: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar demonstrated that vulnerable hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells could be rescued from forebrain ischemic injury by overexpressing calcium-impermeable GluR2(R) subunits, whereas expressing calcium permeable GluR2(Q) subunits in normally ischemia-insensitive hippocampal dentate granule cells resulted in degeneration of these cells after ischemia. This, in conjunction with work by other groups, provides substantial evidence to support a critical role for Ca2+-permeable AMPARs in mediating ischemic cell death. Remaining more controversial are the molecular mechanisms that underlie the postischemic downregulation of GluR2(R) protein and, in particular, the role of GluR2 Q/R editing in this process (Pellegrini-Giampietro et al., 1997Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E.

Lu Y. Neuron. 2006; 49 (this issue): 719-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar describe an important additional step toward understanding the mechanisms that increase AMPAR Ca2+ permeability in vulnerable CA1 hippocampal cells after transient forebrain ischemia. Using a combination of electrophysiology and single-cell RT-PCR, the authors correlated GluR2 Q/R editing efficiency with the Ca2+ permeability of AMPARs in single neurons. Postischemic CA1 pyramidal cells exhibited very high levels of heterogeneity in Q/R editing (7%–98%) compared with sham controls or other less-vulnerable hippocampal cell types (CA3 pyramidal or dentate granule cells), which all exhibited over 95% editing efficiency, suggesting that GluR2 Q/R editing in CA1 pyramidal neurons is particularly vulnerable to ischemic insult. Importantly, the impaired GluR2 Q/R editing correlated closely with the Ca2+-permeability of AMPAR channels (assessed from the reversal potential of the AMPAR current) in these cells. The authors argue that a failure of previous studies to detect alterations in levels of GluR2 Q/R editing in ischemia may reflect the use of whole hippocampal tissue rather than RNA derived from single electrophysiologically characterised cells as in the current work (Pellegrini-Giampietro et al., 1997Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Gorter J.A. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The authors then addressed whether the decrease in GluR2 Q/R editing they observed was due to an altered availability of the GluR2 RNA editing enzyme ADAR2. Using quantitative PCR, they demonstrated that transient forebrain ischemia dramatically decreased ADAR2 (but not ADAR1 or ADAR3) mRNA levels in postischemic CA1 pyramidal cells and that this closely correlated with reduced GluR2 Q/R editing. Critically, the levels of ADAR2 in ischemia insensitive dentate granule and CA3 neurons remained unaltered under the same conditions. Based on these observations, the authors propose that levels of ADAR2 play a crucial role in regulating the postischemic formation of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs. To confirm this, Peng et al. examined the consequences of altering ADAR2 expression levels for GluR2 Q/R editing and AMPAR properties. Using adeno-associated viral vectors to express ADAR2 in adult hippocampus in vivo, the authors were able to return postischemic GluR2 Q/R editing to normal (over 95%) levels in vulnerable CA1 hippocampal cells, which resulted in postischemic AMPARs that were Ca2+ impermeable. Viral expression of ADAR2 was also found to be neuroprotective for vulnerable CA1 pyramidal cells. Conversely, knockdown of hippocampal ADAR2 levels, with viral vectors expressing small interfering RNA (siRNA), upregulated Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (15-fold) in dentate granule cells that usually express a Ca2+-impermeable form of the receptor. Furthermore, ADAR2 knockdown increased the sensitivity of CA1 pyramidal cells to ischemic injury and also increased postischemic cell death in dentate granule and CA3 pyramidal neurons that are usually insensitive to an ischemic insult. Importantly, the postischemic neuronal degeneration caused by ADAR2 knockdown in all cell types could be blocked by virally coexpressing Ca2+-impermeable GluR2(R), supporting the notion that ADAR2-dependent reduction of GluR2(R) editing is a critical determinant of neuronal vulnerability to an ischemic insult. Finally, the authors showed that the postischemic downregulation of ADAR2 levels in vulnerable CA1 neurons is due to altered CREB-dependent transcriptional regulation of ADAR2 because it could be blocked by virally expressing constitutively active VP16-CREB, which restored GluR2 Q/R editing levels to over 90% and blocked the formation of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that ADAR2 activity is required for CREB-dependent regulation of GluR2 Q/R site editing because siRNA ADAR2 knockdown in the same cells expressing VP16-CREB was found to override VP16-CREB-dependent protection of GluR2 Q/R editing levels, resulting in the generation of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs. Taken together, these elegant experiments present convincing evidence that the vulnerability of CA1 neurons to ischemic injury is due to decreased CREB activity, leading to reduced ADAR2 expression, a switch in the ratio of edited to unedited GluR2 Q/R subunits, and an increase in Ca2+ (and possibly Zn2+) influx via Ca2+-permeable AMPARs. Other mechanisms leading to a postischemic calcium concentration rise, including Ca2+ entry via ASIC and TRPM-7 channels and calpain-dependent inactivation of the major Ca2+ extrusion pathway, have also been recently reported (Aarts et al., 2003Aarts M.

Ultimately, ischemia-evoked death of CA1 pyramidal neurons is caused by Ca2+ entry through NMDARs (Simon et al., 1984Simon R.P. Swan J.H. Griffiths T. Meldrum B.S. Science. 1984; 226: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, Lo et al., 2003Lo E.H. Dalkara T. Moskowitz M.A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2003Wang J. Liu S. Fu Y. Wang J.H. Lu Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). How does the Ca2+ influx through AMPARs studied here control the NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx? Based on previous work by the same group, the authors propose that AMPAR-mediated Ca2+ influx activates cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which phosphorylates serine 1232 on the NR2A subunit of NMDA receptors and thus potentiates NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx, specifically in CA1 neurons (Wang et al., 2003Wang J. Liu S. Fu Y. Wang J.H. Lu Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is unclear why Ca2+ influx through the NMDARs themselves could not cause this potentiation. However, the fact that this potentiation is specific to CA1 pyramidal neurons may in part explain why activation of calcium-permeable AMPARs is neurotoxic in CA1 cells, whereas other neuronal types (such as hippocampal interneurons) express Ca2+-permeable AMPARs without deleterious effects (Pellegrini-Giampietro et al., 1997Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Gorter J.A. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The contribution to the increased formation of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs of direct GluR2 transcriptional downregulation, as opposed to the alteration in ADAR2-dependent GluR2 Q/R editing described above, needs to be investigated further. Others have recently demonstrated that the transcriptional repressor REST is upregulated after global ischemia, resulting in a suppression of GluR2 promoter activity and GluR2 expression, which is proposed to result in an almost complete switch to Ca2+-permeable GluR2-lacking AMPARs (Noh et al., 2005Noh K.M. Yokota H. Mashiko T. Castillo P.E. Zukin R.S. Bennett M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 12230-12235Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the current study, the authors argue that the postischemic reduction in ADAR2-dependent GluR2 Q/R editing results in an accumulation of unedited GluR2 pre-mRNA in the nucleus, which downregulates both GluR2 mRNA and protein levels (Seeburg and Hartner, 2003Seeburg P.H. Hartner J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but that the remaining GluR2(Q) protein is preferentially assembled to produce Ca2+-permeable AMPARs that are exported to synapses (Greger et al., 2003Greger I.H. Khatri L. Kong X. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2003; 40: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Further experiments are needed to address these differences. It will also be of interest to establish what cellular mechanisms underlie the downregulation of CREB activity in vulnerable neurons, which reduces ADAR2 gene expression. One possibility is that calcium entry through extrasynaptic NMDARs inhibits CREB (Hardingham et al., 2002Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that previous studies have reported that the downregulation of GluR2 mRNA is not blocked by either AMPA or NMDA receptor blockers (Pellegrini-Giampietro et al., 1997Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Gorter J.A. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) but is blocked by Ca2+EDTA (which chelates Zn2+) and antisense knockdown of REST (Calderone et al., 2004Calderone A. Jover T. Mashiko T. Noh K.M. Tanaka H. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9903-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Noh et al., 2005Noh K.M. Yokota H. Mashiko T. Castillo P.E. Zukin R.S. Bennett M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 12230-12235Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to test the effects on postischemic ADAR2 gene expression of blocking Ca2+ entry through NMDARs (or other sources of external calcium) and of blocking other calcium-independent signaling pathways. The results of Peng et al. may have important implications for other neurological and psychiatric diseases in which activation of Ca2+-permeable AMPAR-dependent cell death mechanisms have been implicated in disease etiology, such as epilepsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Pellegrini-Giampietro et al., 1997Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Gorter J.A. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In particular, the recent observation of highly variable (0%–100%) GluR2 Q/R editing in motor neurons from ALS patients suggests that altered CREB-dependent ADAR2 activity may be a common mechanism in several neuronal diseases (Kawahara et al., 2004Kawahara Y. Ito K. Sun H. Aizawa H. Kanazawa I. Kwak S. Nature. 2004; 427: 801Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+-permeable AMPARs or their RNA processing machinery may be promising therapeutic targets for intervention in stroke and other neurological diseases. ADAR2-Dependent RNA Editing of AMPA Receptor Subunit GluR2 Determines Vulnerability of Neurons in Forebrain IschemiaPeng et al.NeuronMarch 02, 2006In BriefADAR2 is a nuclear enzyme essential for GluR2 pre-mRNA editing at Q/R site-607, which gates Ca2+ entry through AMPA receptor channels. Here, we show that forebrain ischemia in adult rats selectively reduces expression of ADAR2 enzyme and, hence, disrupts RNA Q/R site editing of GluR2 subunit in vulnerable neurons. Recovery of GluR2 Q/R site editing by expression of exogenous ADAR2b gene or a constitutively active CREB, VP16-CREB, which induces expression of endogenous ADAR2, protects vulnerable neurons in the rat hippocampus from forebrain ischemic insult.
