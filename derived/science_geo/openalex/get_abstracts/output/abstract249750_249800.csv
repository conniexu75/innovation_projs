https://openalex.org/W2160973386,"How is the characteristic shape of a membrane bound organelle achieved? We have used an in vitro system to address the mechanism by which the tubular network of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is generated and maintained. Based on the inhibitory effect of sulfhydryl reagents and antibodies, network formation in vitro requires the integral membrane protein Rtn4a/NogoA, a member of the ubiquitous reticulon family. Both in yeast and mammalian cells, the reticulons are largely restricted to the tubular ER and are excluded from the continuous sheets of the nuclear envelope and peripheral ER. Upon overexpression, the reticulons form tubular membrane structures. The reticulons interact with DP1/Yop1p, a conserved integral membrane protein that also localizes to the tubular ER. These proteins share an unusual hairpin topology in the membrane. The simultaneous absence of the reticulons and Yop1p in S. cerevisiae results in disrupted tubular ER. We propose that these “morphogenic” proteins partition into and stabilize highly curved ER membrane tubules. How is the characteristic shape of a membrane bound organelle achieved?

We propose that these “morphogenic” proteins partition into and stabilize highly curved ER membrane tubules. Many organelles have characteristic shapes that often deviate significantly from spheres, likely the energetically most stable form of a membrane bound object. An example is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which consists of two major, differently shaped domains: the nuclear envelope (NE) and the peripheral ER (Baumann and Walz, 2001Baumann O. Walz B.

Rapoport T.A. Structural organization of the endoplasmic reticulum.EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The NE consists of two continuous sheets of membranes, the inner and outer nuclear membrane, connected to one another at nuclear pores. The approximately spherical shape of the NE is stabilized by interactions between inner nuclear membrane proteins and the underlying chromatin and—in higher eukaryotes—the nuclear lamina (Holmer and Worman, 2001Holmer L. Worman H.J. Inner nuclear membrane proteins: functions and targeting.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1741-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The peripheral ER consists of a network of membrane tubules connected by three-way junctions. It also contains membrane sheets (cisternae), particularly close to the nucleus, which are prominent in secretory cells (Baumann and Walz, 2001Baumann O. Walz B. Endoplasmic reticulum of animal cells and its organization into structural and functional domains.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 205: 149-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the peripheral ER extends from the NE throughout the entire cell, while in S. cerevisiae, it is located beneath the plasma membrane, linked by a few tubules to the NE (Prinz et al., 2000Prinz W.A. Grzyb L. Veenhuis M. Kahana J.A. Silver P.A. Rapoport T.A. Mutants affecting the structure of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The entire ER is a continuous membrane system enclosing a single luminal space. The mechanism by which the tubular ER is generated and maintained is unclear. One idea is that membrane tubules are generated by being pulled out by molecular motors as they move along microtubule or actin filaments or by the tips of filaments as these grow by polymerization (for review, see Du et al., 2004Du Y. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Dynamics and inheritance of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2871-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the cytoskeleton is indeed required for dynamic movements of the ER network, the alignment of membrane tubules with microtubules in mammalian cells and with actin in plants and yeast is not perfect (Prinz et al., 2000Prinz W.A. Grzyb L. Veenhuis M. Kahana J.A. Silver P.A. Rapoport T.A. Mutants affecting the structure of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J.

Chen L.B. Fujiwara K. Microtubules and the endoplasmic reticulum are highly interdependent structures.J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), and the network only retracts slowly upon depolymerization of microtubules (Terasaki et al., 1986Terasaki M. Chen L.B. Fujiwara K. Microtubules and the endoplasmic reticulum are highly interdependent structures.J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thus, the cytoskeleton does not seem to be essential to maintain ER tubules. In addition, when ER networks are formed in vitro from small vesicles, an intact microtubule or actin network is not required (Dreier and Rapoport, 2000Dreier L. Rapoport T.A. In vitro formation of the endoplasmic reticulum occurs independently of microtubules by a controlled fusion reaction.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Other models of ER network formation and maintenance postulate the existence of abundant scaffolding proteins inside or outside of the ER or the regulation of internal ER volume by ion pumps and water flow restriction (Voeltz et al., 2002Voeltz G.K. Rolls M.M. Rapoport T.A. Structural organization of the endoplasmic reticulum.EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, scaffolds are not obvious in electron microscopy pictures and would be difficult to reconcile with the dynamic nature of the ER tubules, and the ER membrane is permeable to small molecules (Le Gall et al., 2004Le Gall S. Neuhof A. Rapoport T. The endoplasmic reticulum membrane is permeable to small molecules.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most plausible models for tubule formation and maintenance are based on mechanisms that generate or stabilize high curvature in membranes. For example, the high curvature in cross-sections of the tubules could be generated if the two leaflets of a membrane had different lipid compositions (for review, see Farsad and De Camilli, 2003Farsad K. De Camilli P. Mechanisms of membrane deformation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, Sprong et al., 2001Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. How proteins move lipids and lipids move proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Proteins would be required to keep the lipid imbalance or to create curvature on their own. Here we have used an in vitro system as the starting point to identify membrane proteins involved in ER network formation. Based on localization, overexpression, and deletion experiments, we reach the conclusion that the reticulons and the interacting protein DP1/Yop1p are the major components shaping the tubular ER. To identify components required for tubular ER formation, we used a previously established in vitro system (Dreier and Rapoport, 2000Dreier L. Rapoport T.A. In vitro formation of the endoplasmic reticulum occurs independently of microtubules by a controlled fusion reaction.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The starting material were small (50–100 nm) salt-washed membrane vesicles from Xenopus laevis eggs that are devoid of cytosolic proteins and depleted of peripheral membrane proteins (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). When these vesicles were incubated at 25°C in the presence of GTP, they fused to form an elaborate network (Figure 1A, lower versus upper left panels) that could also be stained with antibodies to an ER marker but not with antibodies to other organelles (Dreier and Rapoport, 2000Dreier L. Rapoport T.A. In vitro formation of the endoplasmic reticulum occurs independently of microtubules by a controlled fusion reaction.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Efficient network formation occurred at 200 mM salt in the absence of cytosol; at low salt (50 mM), larger vesicles appeared instead (Figure 1A, lower right panel). In the absence of GTP (Figure 1A, upper right panel) or in the presence of GTPγS (Dreier and Rapoport, 2000Dreier L. Rapoport T.A. In vitro formation of the endoplasmic reticulum occurs independently of microtubules by a controlled fusion reaction.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), neither networks nor large vesicles were formed, suggesting that GTP hydrolysis is required for fusion during tubule and large-vesicle formation. Because only a small portion of the sample is analyzed in the visual assay, we developed a quantitative and more objective assay for network formation, similar to one used to measure vacuole fusion (Merz and Wickner, 2004Merz A.J. Wickner W.T. Trans-SNARE interactions elicit Ca2+ efflux from the yeast vacuole lumen.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The release of Ca2+ ions from the ER lumen was followed with the photoluminescent protein aequorin. During network formation, Ca2+ was released, reaching a maximum level of ∼250 nM after 30 min (Figure 1B). At low salt concentrations, when larger vesicles form instead of networks, Ca2+ efflux was significantly slower. In the absence of GTP, Ca2+ efflux was negligible. These data show that network formation correlates with rapid Ca2+ efflux. Therefore, we have two assays that can be used to identify factors involved in ER tubule formation. Since all components required for in vitro ER network formation appeared to be tightly associated with membranes, we first searched for an inhibitor of the reaction and then identified its target. We found that very low concentrations (≤5 μM) of various sulfhydryl (SH) reagents effectively inhibited network formation and, to some extent, vesicle fusion (Figure 1C). This effect could be prevented by the addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) (Figure 1C; lower right panel), indicating that inhibition is caused by the modification of an SH group in a protein involved in network formation. Since even large, membrane-impermeable SH reagents such as maleimide PEG (MP, 5 kDa) or maleimide neutravidin (MN, 60 kDa) block network formation (Figure 1C), the target SH group must be exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of the vesicles. To identify the target, we used a biotinylation reagent. Membranes were modified with inhibitory concentrations (5 μM) of maleimide biotin and solubilized in detergent. The biotinylated proteins were bound to monomeric avidin agarose, eluted with excess biotin, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie blue (Figure 1D, lane 2; lane 3 shows a control in which modification was prevented by DTT). When an excess of the membrane-impermeable reagent maleimide PEG was added, several proteins were no longer biotinylated (Figure 1D, lane 4 versus lane 2). These proteins likely have a cytoplasmically exposed SH group and are thus the best candidates to be involved in ER network formation. Only three proteins showed this behavior. They were identified by mass spectroscopy as IP3 receptor 1 (IP3R; 300 kDa), reticulon 4a (Rtn4a/NogoA; runs at ∼200 kDa), and reticulon 4b (Rtn4b/NogoB; 40 kDa). Rtn4a/NogoA and Rtn4b/NogoB belong to the ubiquitous reticulon protein family, which are located in the ER (hence the name), and share a conserved C-terminal “reticulon domain” of ∼190 amino acids that includes two hydrophobic segments (Oertle et al., 2003aOertle T. Klinger M. Stuermer C.A. Schwab M.E.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2403-2416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the reticulons, Rtn4a/NogoA has been implicated in inhibiting axon outgrowth because antibodies promote and soluble domains of Rtn4a/NogoA inhibit neurite growth (Chen et al., 2000Chen M.S. Huber A.B. van der Haar M.E. Frank M. Schnell L. Spillmann A.A. Christ F. Schwab M.E.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5393-5406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, given that the reticulons are primarily localized to the ER (>95%) and have relatives in all eukaryotic cells, including yeast, it seems that they have intracellular and ubiquitous roles. To discriminate among the identified candidate proteins, we treated Xenopus membranes with increasing concentrations of maleimide biotin and analyzed modified proteins by blotting with peroxidase-coupled streptavidin (Figure 2A, upper panel). Only one band, corresponding in mobility to that of Rtn4a/NogoA, was seen, suggesting that the other proteins may be bound to the avidin beads via Rtn4a/NogoA, consistent with reported interactions among the reticulons (Dodd et al., 2005Dodd D.A. Niederoest B. Bloechlinger S. Dupuis L. Loeffler J.P. Schwab M.E. Nogo-A, -B, and -C are found on the cell surface and interact together in many different cell types.J. Biol.

Pro-apoptotic ASY/Nogo-B protein associates with ASYIP.J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with antibodies raised against the common C terminus of Rtn4a/NogoA and Rtn4b/NogoB showed that, at a concentration of 5–10 μM maleimide biotin, Rtn4a/NogoA was quantitatively modified (second panel), correlating with complete inhibition of network formation (Figure 2B; results of visual assay in Figure 2C). On the other hand, Rtn4b/NogoB was only partially modified at even higher concentrations. These results suggest that Rtn4a/NogoA may be the major target of maleimide-biotin modification. A role for Rtn4a/NogoA in network formation is further supported by modification experiments with the large reagent maleimide neutravidin. It selectively modified Rtn4a/NogoA, as indicated by the size shift in SDS-PAGE, but not Rtn4b/NogoB or IP3R (Figure 2D). The degree of modification of Rtn4a/NogoA correlated well with progressive inhibition of network formation, as followed by the Ca2+ efflux and visual assays (Figure 2E and data not shown). Similar results were obtained with the reagent maleimide PEG (data not shown). To further test whether Rtn4a/NogoA is a key component involved in ER network formation, we wished to raise inhibitory antibodies. We reasoned that a good target for antibodies might be an Rtn4a/NogoA domain that contains cysteines modified by inhibitory concentrations of the SH reagents. We identified by mass spectrometry cysteines modified by N-ethylmaleimide and found two of them in the N-terminal domain of Rtn4a/NogoA (Figure 3A), which is located in the cytosol (Oertle et al., 2003aOertle T. Klinger M. Stuermer C.A. Schwab M.E. A reticular rhapsody: phylogenic evolution and nomenclature of the RTN/Nogo gene family.FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar; see also below) and is lacking in Rtn4b/NogoB. Antibodies raised against a segment (positions 535–736) that includes these two cysteines were affinity purified and recognized a major protein of the expected size (Figure S2). When preincubated with membrane vesicles, they inhibited network formation as measured by Ca2+ efflux; inhibition was seen at concentrations as low as 0.3 μM (Figure 3B). Similar results were seen in the visual assay (Figure 3C). Interestingly, although few networks were generated at high antibody concentrations, vesicle fusion was still observed (Figure 3C, compare with low salt panel). The antibodies also did not block fusion into large vesicles at low salt concentrations, although a slight inhibition cannot be excluded (Figure S3). Inhibition of network formation, but not fusion, was also seen with a crude IgG fraction prepared from the Rtn4a/NogoA antiserum, while IgG depleted of Rtn4a/NogoA antibodies had no effect (Figure S4). On the other hand, even high concentrations of affinity-purified antibodies to the abundant ER membrane proteins IP3R or TRAPα did not inhibit network formation as measured by the Ca2+ efflux (Figure 3B) or visual (Figure 3C) assays. These data thus indicate that Rtn4a/NogoA is required for ER network formation in vitro. If Rtn4a/NogoA plays a role in ER tubule formation or maintenance, one might expect it to localize specifically to the tubular ER. We first tested the localization of mammalian Rtn4a/NogoA in COS cells. Cells transiently expressing Myc-tagged Rtn4a/NogoA together with a GFP fusion to Sec61β were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4A). While Sec61β showed the typical distribution of an ER protein to both the nuclear envelope and the reticular network, Rtn4a/NogoA was prominent in the peripheral ER and essentially absent from the nuclear rim (upper panels). When the microscope was focused on the peripheral ER, the nucleus appeared bright when analyzed for Sec61β and dark when stained for Rtn4a/NogoA (lower panels). A similar, almost exclusive distribution to the peripheral ER was seen for Rtn4c/NogoC, a reticulon isoform that essentially contains only the reticulon domain (Figure 4B). Even in cells that overexpressed Rtn4a/NogoA or Rtn4c/NogoC, a nuclear-envelope localization was not observed. Rtn4c/NogoC was also depleted from Sec61β-containing membrane sheets (cisternae) of the peripheral ER (Figure 4B, merged image in lower panel), and Rtn4a/NogoA expression appears to abolish peripheral ER sheets (Figures 5A and 5B; see also below). The reticulons are the first proteins specifically localized to the tubular ER. The only other known ER protein that is excluded from the nuclear envelope is CLIMP-63, a single-spanning membrane protein found in higher eukaryotes (Klopfenstein et al., 2001Klopfenstein D.R. Klumperman J. Lustig A. Kammerer R.A. Oorschot V. Hauri H.P. Subdomain-specific localization of CLIMP-63 (p63) in the endoplasmic reticulum is mediated by its luminal alpha-helical segment.J.

Scale bars in (A) = 10 μm; (C) and (D) = 1 μm. We next tested the localization of the two reticulons in S. cerevisiae, Rtn1p and Rtn2p, using GFP fusions expressed under the endogenous promoters. Both Rtn1p-GFP and Rtn2p-GFP were almost absent from the nuclear envelope, whereas they were abundant in the tubules of the peripheral ER (Figure 4B). The peculiar localization of Rtn1p was also seen in a recent study, although at higher expression levels, some nuclear localization was reported (Geng et al., 2005Geng J. Shin M.E. Gilbert P.M. Collins R.N. Burd C.G. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rab-GDI displacement factor ortholog Yip3p forms distinct complexes with the Ypt1 Rab GTPase and the reticulon Rtn1p.Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1166-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GFP fusions to six other abundant ER membrane proteins (Sec63p, Figure 4B, upper panels; Erp2p, Sur2p, Wbp1p, Ost1p, and Erg3p, data not shown), were localized to both the nuclear and peripheral ER. The different localizations were confirmed by the analysis of cells that expressed a reticulon together with Sec63p (Figure S5). An exclusive localization to the peripheral, tubular ER was also observed for endogenous Rtn4 in Xenopus tissue culture cells (Figure S6) and for a GFP fusion to Drosophila Rtn1 expressed under the endogenous promoter (M. Rolls, personal communication). Together, these results show that the reticulons are restricted to the tubular, peripheral ER, consistent with a role in shaping this organelle. The role of the reticulons in forming ER tubules is supported by ER morphology changes observed upon overexpression of Rtn4a/NogoA-Myc in COS cells. The ER tubules were generally longer and less branched (Figure 5A, compare with upper left control panel). Membrane sheets in the peripheral ER, which are normally seen when cells express only GFP-Sec61β, were essentially absent (for quantitation, see Figure 5B). Almost every Rtn4a/NogoA-expressing cell had one or more long process that contained parallel or bundled ER tubules (Figure 4A, boxed area; Figure 5A, lower panels; quantitation in Figure 5B). Rtn4a/NogoA-Myc localized all the way to the periphery of the cell, whereas GFP-Sec61β was concentrated close to the nucleus (Figure 4A, lower panel, merge; for quantitation of the effect, see Figure S7), suggesting that Rtn4a/NogoA displaces Sec61β from the peripheral ER. Similar results were obtained in S. cerevisiae. Expression of hemagglutinin (HA) tagged Rtn1p under an inducible Gal promoter resulted in disruption of the peripheral ER but left the nuclear envelope intact (Figure 5C). Rtn1p-GFP was often localized to long filaments (top panel), which were not seen with the other ER proteins. The overexpression of a control ER protein (Erg3p) under the same Gal promoter did not result in long filaments (Figure 5C, lower left panels; similar data for Ost1p not shown). These structures are distinct from karmellae formed by the overexpression of some ER proteins (e.g., Hmg2p; see Figure 5C, lower right panel). These data suggest that, in both mammalian and yeast cells, the reticulons have a strong preference to localize to the tubular ER. When overexpressed, the reticulons even appear to induce tubules (Figures 5A and 5C). Next we tested whether yeast cells lacking the reticulons have altered ER morphology. Mutants lacking Rtn1p, Rtn2p, or both are viable, and, even in the double-deletion mutant, the morphology of the peripheral ER network appeared normal (data not shown). However, when the cells were placed for 1 hr in a high-osmolarity medium (1 M NaCl [Figure 5D] or 1 M sorbitol [data not shown]), the peripheral ER converted into membrane sheets (Figure 5D, lower right panel). This effect was not seen with the wild-type strain or the single-deletion mutants (Figure 5D and data not shown). Therefore, the reticulons are needed for the maintenance of tubular ER under certain stress conditions, but they cannot be the only components required under normal circumstances. Given that the reticulons associate with one another, we reasoned that additional components involved in shaping the tubular ER might be found in a complex with them. We therefore searched for partners of Xenopus Rtn4a/NogoA either by precipitating Rtn4a/NogoA from membrane extracts using affinity-purified antibodies to its N terminus or by first modifying Rtn4a/NogoA in membranes with maleimide neutravidin and then incubating the extract with biotin beads. With both approaches, mass spectrometry identified an integral, ubiquitous membrane protein, called DP1 (for “deleted in polyposis”) or TB2 (Joslyn et al., 1991Joslyn G. Carlson M. Thliveris A. Albertsen H. Gelbert L. Samowitz W. Groden J. Stevens J. Spirio L.

In addition, Rtn3 was found, consistent with the previously reported interactions among the mammalian reticulons (Dodd et al., 2005Dodd D.A. Niederoest B. Bloechlinger S. Dupuis L. Loeffler J.P. Schwab M.E. Nogo-A, -B, and -C are found on the cell surface and interact together in many different cell types.J. Biol.

An association between the yeast reticulons and the DP1 homolog Yop1p (Calero et al., 2001Calero M. Whittaker G.R. Collins R.N. Yop1p, the yeast homolog of the polyposis locus protein 1, interacts with Yip1p and negatively regulates cell growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12100-12112Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) could also be demonstrated; when TAP-tagged Yop1p was expressed under its endogenous promoter and purified on IgG beads, HA-tagged Rtn1p or Rtn2p expressed in the same cells was copurified (Figure 6B). TAP-tagged Rtn1p also interacted with Rtn1p-HA or Rtn2p-HA (Figure 6B), demonstrating that the reticulons form homo- and hetero-oligomers in yeast. Rtn1p is one of the most abundant membrane proteins (∼37,000 molecules/cell) (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar), and Yop1p appears to be equally abundant as judged from immunoblots of the TAP-tagged proteins expressed under the endogenous promoters (data not shown). Rtn2p seems to be significantly less abundant (unpublished data and http://yeastgfp.ucsf.edu). Like the reticulons, HA-tagged DP1 localized exclusively to the tubular ER in COS cells, avoiding both the nuclear envelope and peripheral ER sheets (Figure 6C). In cells expre"

Here, we identified CREBH as a RIP-regulated liver-specific transcription factor that is cleaved upon ER stress and required to activate expression of acute phase response (APR) genes. Proinflammatory cytokines increase expression of ER membrane-anchored CREBH. In response to ER stress, CREBH is cleaved by site-1 and site-2 proteases to liberate an amino-terminal fragment that transits to the nucleus to activate transcription of the genes encoding serum amyloid P-component (SAP) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide activate the UPR and induce cleavage of CREBH in the liver in vivo. Together, our studies delineate a molecular mechanism for activation of an ER-localized transcription factor, CREBH, and reveal an unprecedented link by which ER stress initiates an acute inflammatory response."

Its dysfunction is implicated in many human neurodegenerative diseases, as well as in aging. The crystal structure of the hydrophilic domain (peripheral arm) of complex I from Thermus thermophilus has been solved at 3.3 angstrom resolution. This subcomplex consists of eight subunits and contains all the redox centers of the enzyme, including nine iron-sulfur clusters. The primary electron acceptor, flavin-mononucleotide, is within electron transfer distance of cluster N3, leading to the main redox pathway, and of the distal cluster N1a, a possible antioxidant. The structure reveals new aspects of the mechanism and evolution of the enzyme. The terminal cluster N2 is coordinated, uniquely, by two consecutive cysteines. The novel subunit Nqo15 has a similar fold to the mitochondrial iron chaperone frataxin, and it may be involved in iron-sulfur cluster regeneration in the complex."

The biological outcome of TNFα treatment is determined by the balance between NF-κB and Jun kinase (JNK) signaling; NF-κB promotes survival, whereas JNK enhances cell death. Critically, identity of a JNK substrate that promotes TNFα-induced apoptosis has been outstanding. Here we show that TNFα-mediated JNK activation accelerates turnover of the NF-κB-induced antiapoptotic protein c-FLIP, an inhibitor of caspase-8. This is not due to direct c-FLIP phosphorylation but depends on JNK-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, which specifically ubiquitinates c-FLIP and induces its proteasomal degradation. JNK1 or Itch deficiency or treatment with a JNK inhibitor renders mice resistant in three distinct models of TNFα-induced acute liver failure, and cells from these mice do not display inducible c-FLIPL ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, JNK antagonizes NF-κB during TNFα signaling by promoting the proteasomal elimination of c-FLIPL. The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α signals both cell survival and death.

Thus, JNK antagonizes NF-κB during TNFα signaling by promoting the proteasomal elimination of c-FLIPL. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α is a prototypical, proinflammatory cytokine that can signal, through its type 1 receptor (TNFR1), either cell survival, cell proliferation and activation, or cell death (Wajant et al., 2003Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Tumor necrosis factor signaling.Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Binding of TNFα to TNFR1 results in sequential formation of two signaling complexes (Micheau and Tschopp, 2003Micheau O. Tschopp J. Induction of TNF receptor I-mediated apoptosis via two sequential signaling complexes.Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar, Muppidi et al., 2004Muppidi J.R.

Life and death decisions: secondary complexes and lipid rafts in TNF receptor family signal transduction.Immunity. 2004; 21: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The rapidly forming complex I is assembled on the receptor's cytoplasmic tail and consists of the adaptor TRADD, the protein kinase RIP1, and the signal transducer TRAF2. This complex signals inflammation and cell survival through IκB kinase (IKK) dependent activation of transcription factor NF-κB (Liu et al., 1996Liu Z.-G. Hu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Dissection of TNF receptor 1 effector functions: JNK activation is not linked to apoptosis, while NF-κB activation prevents cell death.Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). Subsequently, complex I dissociates from the receptor, and TRADD together with RIP1 associate with the adaptor protein FADD and pro-caspase-8 (also called FLICE) to form complex II. In cells that lack substantial NF-κB activity, formation of complex II results in caspase-8 activation and apoptotic cell death (Muppidi et al., 2004Muppidi J.R. Tschopp J. Siegel R.M. Life and death decisions: secondary complexes and lipid rafts in TNF receptor family signal transduction.Immunity. 2004; 21: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, if NF-κB has been activated during complex I formation, it prevents caspase−8 activation by complex II through induction of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP, also called CASH, Casper, CLARP, FLAME, I-FLICE, MRIT, or Usurpin), an adaptor protein with a pseudo-caspase domain, which specifically inhibits caspase-8 (Thome and Tschopp, 2001Thome M. Tschopp J. Regulation of lymphocyte proliferation and death by FLIP.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Thus, NF-κB may negatively regulate TNFα-induced apoptosis through regulation of c-FLIP levels, and its activation serves as a checkpoint that determines whether complex II will signal cell death or not (Muppidi et al., 2004Muppidi J.R. Tschopp J. Siegel R.M. Life and death decisions: secondary complexes and lipid rafts in TNF receptor family signal transduction.Immunity. 2004; 21: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). NF-κB was also suggested to inhibit TNFα-induced cell death through additional mediators (Wang et al., 1998Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. NF-κB antiapoptosis: induction of TRAF1 and TRAF2 and c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 to suppress caspase-8 activation.Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the c-FLIP-dependent mechanism has received physiological support through analysis of Flip−/− fibroblasts which undergo TNFα−induced apoptosis even without inhibition of NF-κB-dependent gene expression (Yeh et al., 2000Yeh W.C. Itie A. Elia A.J. Ng M. Shu H.B. Wakeham A. Mirtsos C. Suzuki N. Bonnard M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Requirement for Casper (c-FLIP) in regulation of death receptor-induced apoptosis and embryonic development.Immunity. 2000; 12: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Multiple c-Flip mRNA splice isoforms give rise to either a long FLIP (c−FLIPL) polypeptide of 55 kDa, a short FLIP polypeptide (c−FLIPS) of 26 kDa (Irmler et al., 1997aIrmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schreoter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. et al.Inhibition of death receptor signals by cellular FLIP.Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar, Krueger et al., 2001aKrueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. FLICE-inhibitory proteins: regulators of death receptor-mediated apoptosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), or a third 23 kDa recently identified form, called FLIPR (Golks et al., 2005Golks A. Brenner D. Fritsch C. Krammer P.H. Lavrik I.N. c-FLIPR, a new regulator of death receptor-induced apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14507-14513Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Due to its structural similarity to caspase-8 and caspase-10, c-FLIPL undergoes caspase−mediated cleavage to generate a 43 kDa isoform that still contains death effector domains (DED) and the pseudo-caspase motif and can therefore remain bound to FADD and inhibit complete caspase-8 processing and activation (Krueger et al., 2001bKrueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein splice variants inhibit different steps of caspase-8 activation at the CD95 death-inducing signaling complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20633-20640Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In addition to NF-κB, another important regulator of TNFα signaling is Jun kinase (JNK), a member of the MAP kinase (MAPK) subfamily (Varfolomeev and Ashkenazi, 2004Varfolomeev E.E. Ashkenazi A. Tumor necrosis factor: an apoptosis JuNKie?.Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). It is well established that the balance between NF-κB and JNK activities determines the outcome of TNFα signaling, such that NF-κB promotes cell survival, whereas prolonged JNK activation enhances TNFα-induced death (De Smaele et al., 2001De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G.

Karin M. Lin A. Inhibition of JNK activation through NF-kappaB target genes.Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). We have shown that NF-κB controls the duration of JNK activation through induction of genes encoding antioxidant proteins, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) 2, that prevent oxidation and subsequent inhibition of MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Kamata et al., 2005Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Reactive oxygen species promote TNFα-induced death and sustained JNK activation by inhibiting MAP kinase phosphatases.Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism through which prolonged JNK activation promotes TNFα-induced death, however, remained elusive. It was recently proposed that JNK activation somehow promotes processing of the BH3-domain protein Bid to proapoptotic cleavage products, such as tBid (Luo et al., 1998Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Bid, a Bcl2 interacting protein, mediates cytochrome c release from mitochondria in response to activation of cell surface death receptors.Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar) and jBid (Deng et al., 2003Deng Y. Ren X. Yang L. Lin Y. Wu X. A JNK-dependent pathway is required for TNFalpha-induced apoptosis.Cell. 2003; 115: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), that allow TNFα-induced apoptosis to proceed. Nonetheless, a JNK-dependent phosphorylation event that controls Bid processing or the activity of any defined component of the TNFR1-activated death or survival machinery has not been identified. We now show that JNK activity controls TNFα-induced death through the proteasomal processing of c-FLIPL, the very molecule that inhibits the apoptotic activity of complex II and whose expression is NF-κB dependent (Micheau and Tschopp, 2003Micheau O. Tschopp J. Induction of TNF receptor I-mediated apoptosis via two sequential signaling complexes.Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar). Instead of direct c-FLIPL phosphorylation, JNK promotes accelerated decay of c-FLIPL through activation of the ubiquitin ligase Itch, the first member of the HECT family of E3 ligases whose catalytic activity was shown to be phosphorylation (JNK1) dependent (Gao et al., 2004Gao M. Labuda T. Xia Y. Gallagher E. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Jun turnover is controlled through JNK-dependent phosphorylation of the E3 ligase Itch.Science. 2004; 306: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Importantly, JNK1- and Itch-deficient mice, as well as mice given a specific JNK inhibitor, are resistant to three different models of fulminant hepatitis, a pathological response that depends on TNFR1 activation (Maeda et al., 2003Maeda S. Chang L. Li Z.W. Luo J.L. Leffert H. Karin M. IKKβ is required for prevention of apoptosis mediated by cell-bound but not by circulating TNFalpha.Immunity. 2003; 19: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These mice fail to ubiquitinate and degrade c-FLIPL in response to hepatitis-inducing challenges, and their hepatocytes do not undergo apoptosis when challenged with TNFα and a transcriptional inhibitor. The midgestational lethality due to massive liver apoptosis of NF-κB-deficient mice, which is common to mice lacking RelA, IKKβ, or IKKγ, is completely suppressed by removal of either TNFα or TNFR1 (reviewed by Karin and Lin, 2002Karin M. Lin A. NF-κB at the crossroads of life and death.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of JNK1 in TNFR1 death signaling in mice lacking IKKβ, we crossed Ikkβ+/− and Jnk1+/− heterozygote mice to generate Ikkβ−/−/Jnk1−/− double mutants. In these and subsequent experiments, we chose to use JNK1-deficient mice and cells because it has been noticed that JNK1 rather than JNK2 is required for TNFα-induced apoptosis (Liu et al., 2004Liu J. Minemoto Y. Lin A. c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK1), but not JNK2, is essential for tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced c-Jun kinase activation and apoptosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10844-10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar; L.C., unpublished data). The absence of JNK1 delayed the lethality caused by removal of IKKβ by 4 days (Figure 1A). Histological analysis of livers from E14.5 fetuses revealed extensive hepatocyte apoptosis in Ikkβ−/− fetuses, which was absent in Ikkβ−/−/Jnk1−/−double mutants (Figure 1B). These results underscore the physiological importance of the previously described crosstalk between IKKβ-NF-κB and JNK1. Accordingly, primary hepatocytes from Jnk1−/− mice were resistant to apoptosis induced by incubation with TNFα plus cycloheximide (to inhibit expression of survival genes) and failed to cleave caspase-8 and -9 (Figure 1C). These cells also exhibited reduced levels of caspase-3 cleavage and cytochrome c release in comparison to similarly treated wild-type (wt) cells. Despite the clear evidence, here and elsewhere (De Smaele et al., 2001De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G.

Inhibition of JNK activation through NF-kappaB target genes.Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), that prolonged JNK activation is important for TNFα-induced death of NF-κB-deficient cells, it has been questioned whether prolonged JNK activation alone is sufficient to induce apoptosis in the absence of TNFR1 activation (Liu et al., 1996Liu Z.-G. Hu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Dissection of TNF receptor 1 effector functions: JNK activation is not linked to apoptosis, while NF-κB activation prevents cell death.Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar, Tang et al., 2001Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Inhibition of JNK activation through NF-kappaB target genes.Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, Varfolomeev and Ashkenazi, 2004Varfolomeev E.E. Ashkenazi A. Tumor necrosis factor: an apoptosis JuNKie?.Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). This is an important issue, as its resolution should indicate whether JNK regulates a specific component of the TNFR1 death signaling pathway or a more general and downstream aspect of the apoptotic machinery. To answer this question, we transfected Ikkβ−/− fibroblasts, which undergo cell death upon incubation with TNFα alone, with a JNK1 expression vector alone or together with a dominant-negative MKP-7 mutant, MKP-7ΔC(C244S), that allows prolonged JNK activation in response to cell stimulation due to inhibition of endogenous MKPs (Kamata et al., 2005Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Reactive oxygen species promote TNFα-induced death and sustained JNK activation by inhibiting MAP kinase phosphatases.Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). As expected, prolonged JNK activation was observed in cells expressing MKP-7ΔC(C244S) that were stimulated with IL-1, but despite that and the absence of IKKβ, these cells did not die (Figure 1D). As before, substantial cell death was seen in TNFα-stimulated Ikkβ−/− fibroblasts, and it was not further enhanced by expression of the mutant MKP. These results indicate that prolonged JNK1 activation alone is not sufficient for activation of the apoptotic machinery even in IKKβ- (and NF-κB-) deficient cells. These findings therefore suggest that JNK1 targets a specific component of TNFR1 signaling to allow TNFα-induced apoptosis and does not act on a downstream target that is common to several distinct apoptosis signaling pathways. As mentioned above, TNFR1 death signaling depends on the progression from complex I to complex II, and the ability of caspase-8, a key component of complex II, to undergo activation (Micheau and Tschopp, 2003Micheau O. Tschopp J. Induction of TNF receptor I-mediated apoptosis via two sequential signaling complexes.Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-8 is modulated by the levels of c-FLIP, its specific inhibitor (Krammer, 2000Krammer P.H. CD95′s deadly mission in the immune system.Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Importantly, transcription of the c-Flip gene, which gives rise to c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS isoforms, is controlled by NF-κB (Micheau et al., 2001Micheau O. Lens S. Gaide O. Alevizopoulos K. Tschopp J. NF-kappaB signals induce the expression of c-FLIP.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5299-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), and Flip−/− fibroblasts undergo apoptosis when incubated with TNFα alone (Yeh et al., 2000Yeh W.C. Itie A. Elia A.J. Ng M. Shu H.B. Wakeham A. Mirtsos C. Suzuki N. Bonnard M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Requirement for Casper (c-FLIP) in regulation of death receptor-induced apoptosis and embryonic development.Immunity. 2000; 12: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of JNK1 on various components of the TNFR1 signaling machinery, including c-FLIP, in an in vivo setting, we injected mice with ConA, a potent activator of T cells that triggers TNFR1-dependent hepatocyte death, thereby causing fulminant and lethal hepatitis (Maeda et al., 2003Maeda S. Chang L. Li Z.W. Luo J.L. Leffert H. Karin M. IKKβ is required for prevention of apoptosis mediated by cell-bound but not by circulating TNFalpha.Immunity. 2003; 19: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis revealed that mouse liver contained mostly the c-FLIPL isoform, even prior to ConA administration (Figure 2A). c-FLIPL, unlike c-FLIPS, contains a pseudo-caspase domain and is therefore a specific caspase-8 inhibitor (Irmler et al., 1997bIrmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schreoter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. et al.Inhibition of death receptor signals by cellular FLIP.Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar, Krueger et al., 2001aKrueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20633-20640Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). ConA injection to wt mice caused degradation of c-FLIPL and appearance of an apoptotic DNA ladder (Figure 2A). ConA injection also caused cleavage of caspases-8 and -3 and cytochrome c release (Kamata et al., 2005Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Reactive oxygen species promote TNFα-induced death and sustained JNK activation by inhibiting MAP kinase phosphatases.Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). By contrast, very little c-FLIPL degradation or apoptosis were detected upon ConA injection to Jnk1−/− mice (Figure 2A). Such mice also showed little or no cleavage of caspase-3 and cytochrome c release (Kamata et al., 2005Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Reactive oxygen species promote TNFα-induced death and sustained JNK activation by inhibiting MAP kinase phosphatases.Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). For further biochemical analysis of c-FLIP turnover, we switched to cultured hepatocytes. Again, treatment with TNFα plus cycloheximide reduced the levels of c-FLIPL, the predominant form of c-FLIP in wt hepatocytes, and this was followed by cleavage of Bid and appearance of tBid (Figure 2B, upper panels). By contrast, the same treatment of Jnk1−/− hepatocytes did not decrease c-FLIPL expression and caused very little Bid cleavage. The TNFα-induced decrease in c-FLIPL was indeed JNK1 dependent because infection of Jnk1−/− hepatocytes with a JNK1-expressing lentivirus, but not a GFP lentivirus, restored TNFα-induced c-FLIP degradation (Figure 2B, bottom panels). Real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analysis revealed normal induction of c-Flip mRNA in Jnk1−/− hepatocytes and livers after stimulation with either TNFα plus cycloheximide or ConA (Figure 2C and data not shown). Thus, JNK1 is likely to control c-FLIPL abundance at a posttranscriptional level. Consistent with the results of the RNA and immunoblot analyses, very little c-FLIPL was associated with FADD in livers of wt mice either before or after ConA injection, whereas the levels of FADD-associated c-FLIPL were increased in livers of Jnk1−/− mice after ConA injection (Figure 2D). A reciprocal relationship was found for caspase-8 association with FADD: very little pro-caspase-8 was brought down by the anti-FADD antibody in Jnk1−/− livers, whereas pro-caspase-8 was readily detected in FADD immunoprecipitates from wt liver—especially after ConA administration. A major posttranscriptional mechanism that controls protein levels in eukaryotic cells is ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal turnover (Ciechanover and Schwartz, 2004Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. The ubiquitin system: pathogenesis of human diseases and drug targeting.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To examine proteasome involvement in TNFα-induced c-FLIP decay, we treated cultured hepatocytes with the specific proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Rock et al., 1994Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Inhibitors of the proteasome block the degradation of most cell proteins and the generation of peptides presented on MHC Class I molecules.Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with MG132 completely prevented TNFα-induced c-FLIPL degradation in wt hepatocytes (Figure 3A). MG132 pretreatment also inhibited TNFα-induced IκBα degradation (seen at the 1 hr time point) and prevented caspase-3 cleavage. These results suggest that TNFα induces JNK1-dependent proteasomal degradation of c-FLIP. Proteasomal degradation depends on protein polyubiquitination (Ciechanover and Schwartz, 2004Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. The ubiquitin system: pathogenesis of human diseases and drug targeting.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Indeed, in wt mice ConA administration resulted in appearance of polyubiquitinated forms of c-FLIPL as early as 30 min postinjection (Figure 3B). Much less ConA-induced c-FLIPL ubiquitination was seen in ConA-injected Jnk1−/− mice or wt mice pretreated with a specific JNK-inhibitory peptide, D-JNKi (Borsello et al., 2003Borsello T. Clarke P.G. Hirt L. Vercelli A. Repici M. Schorderet D.F. Bogousslavsky J. Bonny C. A peptide inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase protects against excitotoxicity and cerebral ischemia.Nat.

Protection against ConA-induced fulminant hepatitis and death was also seen in IkkβΔhep mice injected with another specific proteasome inhibitor—bortezomib (Valcade, formerly PS-341) (Adams, 2004Adams J. The proteasome: a suitable antineoplastic target.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) (Figure 3C). Thus, despite the ability of proteasome inhibitors to inhibit NF-κB activation, when added prior to TNFα or ConA, they can prevent TNFα-induced cell death in hepatocytes or liver of animals that are compromised in NF-κB activation. This protective effect is most likely due to stabilization of c-FLIPL (Figure 3A) because infection of Ikkβ−/− cells with a lentivirus encoding the p43 form of c-FLIPL, but not with a GFP lentivirus, prevented TNFα-induced apoptosis (Figure 3D). The results shown above indicate that TNFα induces c-FLIPL degradation in a JNK-dependent manner by inducing its polyubiquitination. As phosphorylation can tag specific proteins for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, e.g., the IκBs (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Phosphorylation meets ubiquitination: the control of NF-κB activity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar), we investigated whether JNK1 could directly phosphorylate c-FLIPL. The results of these experiments were negative, and examination of the c-FLIPL sequence did not reveal obvious JNK docking or phosphoacceptor sites (data not shown). Recently we found that JNK1 can signal specific protein ubiquitination and degradation via phosphorylation-dependent activation of the ubiquitin ligase Itch (Gao et al., 2004Gao M. Labuda T. Xia Y. Gallagher E. Fang D. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Jun turnover is controlled through JNK-dependent phosphorylation of the E3 ligase Itch.Science. 2004; 306: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the susceptibility of fibroblasts from Itchy mutant mice, which do not express Itch (Fang et al., 2002Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Dysregulation of T lymphocyte function in itchy mice: a role for Itch in TH2 differentiation.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) to TNFα-induced apoptosis. Strikingly, incubation of such cells with TNFα plus cycloheximide resulted in very little apoptosis within 8 hr, a time point at which many wt fibroblasts displayed an apoptotic phenotype (Figure 4A). Accordingly, incubation of Itch−/− fibroblasts with TNFα plus cycloheximide resulted in very little and extensively delayed caspase-8 cleavage, delayed caspase-3 activation, and no c-FLIPL degradation (Figure 4B). Similar results were obtained when instead of cycloheximide the different fibroblast cultures were transduced with an adenovirus encoding IκBα superrepressor (IκBα-SR) to inhibit NF-κB. Whereas TNFα treatment of wt cells transduced with this virus resulted in apoptosis and c-FLIPL degradation, very little apoptosis or c-FLIPL degradation were seen in Itch−/− or Jnk1−/− fibroblasts (Figure 4C). Reconstitution of Itch−/− fibroblasts with a lentivirus encoding wt Itch restored TNFα-induced c-FLIPL degradation and apoptosis, while very little apoptosis or c-FLIPL degradation was seen in Itch−/− cells transduced with a lentivirus encoding a mutant form of Itch, AA-Itch, which is refractory to JNK1-induced phosphorylation (Figure 4D; Figure S2). In transient transfection experiments, we found that coexpression of Itch with c-FLIPL resulted in polyubiquitination of the latter that was seen only in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Figure 4E). Itch-induced ubiquitination of c-FLIPL was augmented by coexpression of activated JNK1, a JNK1-JNKK2 fusion protein (Zheng et al., 1999Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. The JNKK2–JNK1 fusion protein acts as a constitutively active c-Jun kinase that stimulates c-Jun transcription activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Coexpression of the antiapoptotic proteins cIAP1 or cIAP2, which contain a RING-finger domain that possesses E3 ligase activity (Yang et al., 2000Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Ubiquitin protein ligase activity of IAPs and their degradation in proteasomes in response to apoptotic stimuli.Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), instead of Itch did not stimulate c-FLIPL ubiquitination (Figure 4E). Coexpression of normal JNK1 had only a small stimulatory effect on basal Itch-induced c-FLIPL ubiquitination, but the ubiquitination response seen in the presence of JNK1 was strongly stimulated by incubating the transfected cells with TNFα (Figure 4F). TNFα weakly enhanced Itch-induced c-FLIPL ubiquitination in the absence of cotransfected JNK1. To further characterize the functional interaction between Itch and c-FLIP, we examined whether the two proteins directly interact. In addition to full-length c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS, we also used two different subfragments of c-FLIPL corresponding to its N"
https://openalex.org/W2156825952,"MEDEA (MEA) is an Arabidopsis Polycomb group gene that is imprinted in the endosperm. The maternal allele is expressed and the paternal allele is silent. MEA is controlled by DEMETER (DME), a DNA glycosylase required to activate MEA expression, and METHYLTRANSFERASE I (MET1), which maintains CG methylation at the MEA locus. Here we show that DME is responsible for endosperm maternal-allele-specific hypomethylation at the MEA gene. DME can excise 5-methylcytosine in vitro and when expressed in E. coli. Abasic sites opposite 5-methylcytosine inhibit DME activity and might prevent DME from generating double-stranded DNA breaks. Unexpectedly, paternal-allele silencing is not controlled by DNA methylation. Rather, Polycomb group proteins that are expressed from the maternal genome, including MEA, control paternal MEA silencing. Thus, DME establishes MEA imprinting by removing 5-methylcytosine to activate the maternal allele. MEA imprinting is subsequently maintained in the endosperm by maternal MEA silencing the paternal allele. MEDEA (MEA) is an Arabidopsis Polycomb group gene that is imprinted in the endosperm.

MEA imprinting is subsequently maintained in the endosperm by maternal MEA silencing the paternal allele. Alleles of imprinted genes are expressed differently depending on whether they are inherited from the male or female parent. Imprinting regulates a number of genes essential for normal development in mammals and angiosperms. In mammals, imprinted genes contribute to the control of fetal growth and placental development (Constancia et al., 2004Constancia M. Kelsey G. Reik W. Resourceful imprinting.Nature. 2004; 432: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Human diseases are linked to mutations in imprinted genes or aberrant regulation of their expression (Constancia et al., 2004Constancia M. Kelsey G. Reik W. Resourceful imprinting.Nature. 2004; 432: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of distinguishing maternal and paternal alleles have been extensively characterized in mammals. Imprinted genes reside in chromosomal clusters and are regulated by differentially methylated imprinting control regions (ICRs) (Reik and Walter, 2001Reik W. Walter J. Genomic imprinting: parental influence on the genome.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Differential DNA methylation is established during oogenesis or spermatogenesis by de novo methyltransferases and maintained somatically by the CG maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1 (Li, 2002Li E. Chromatin modification and epigenetic reprogramming in mammalian development.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). ICRs are subject to differential histone modifications and in some instances can act as chromatin boundaries (Delaval and Feil, 2004Delaval K. Feil R. Epigenetic regulation of mammalian genomic imprinting.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms to regulate allele-specific gene expression involve noncoding RNAs, including antisense transcripts and microRNAs (O'Neill, 2005O'Neill M.J. The influence of non-coding RNA on allele-specific gene expression in mammals.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R113-R120Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which function in large complexes to methylate histones and modify chromatin (Cao and Zhang, 2004Cao R. Zhang Y. The functions of E(Z)/EZH2-mediated methylation of lysine 27 in histone H3.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), maintain allele-specific silencing of some imprinted genes (Delaval and Feil, 2004Delaval K. Feil R. Epigenetic regulation of mammalian genomic imprinting.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The endosperm, one of the products of angiosperm double fertilization, is an important site of imprinting in plants (Gehring et al., 2004Gehring M. Choi Y. Fischer R.L. Imprinting and seed development.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: S203-S213Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and has functions analogous to the placenta. In flowering plants, meiosis followed by mitosis produces the female and male gametophytes. Two cells of the female gametophyte, the haploid egg and the diploid central cell, are fertilized by two haploid sperm from the male gametophyte to form the diploid embryo and triploid endosperm, respectively. The endosperm provides nutrients to the embryo during seed development and, in Arabidopsis, is almost entirely consumed by the time embryo maturation is completed. Molecular events that take place in the female gametophyte before fertilization have an essential role in endosperm gene imprinting. The imprinting of two genes, MEA and FWA, is regulated by DME, a helix-hairpin-helix DNA glycosylase (Choi et al., 2002Choi Y. Gehring M. Johnson L. Hannon M. Harada J.J. Goldberg R.B. Jacobsen S.E. Fischer R.L.

DNA glycosylases function in the base-excision repair pathway by removing damaged or mismatched bases from DNA (Scharer and Jiricny, 2001Scharer O.D. Jiricny J. Recent progress in the biology, chemistry and structural biology of DNA glycosylases.Bioessays. 2001; 23: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Bifunctional helix-hairpin-helix DNA glycosylases have both DNA glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activities. The DNA glycosylase activity removes the damaged or mispaired base by cleaving the N-glycosylic bond, creating an abasic site, whereas the lyase activity nicks the DNA. An AP endonuclease generates a 3′-hydroxyl used by a DNA repair polymerase that inserts the proper nucleotide. A DNA ligase seals the nick to complete the repair process. DNA glycosylase/lyases have not been implicated in mammalian imprinting mechanisms. Both MEA and FWA are expressed in the central cell before fertilization and in the endosperm, from the maternal allele, after fertilization (Kinoshita et al., 1999Kinoshita T. Yadegari R. Harada J.J.

In contrast, DME is expressed in the central cell of the female gametophyte but not in the endosperm (Choi et al., 2002Choi Y. Gehring M. Johnson L. Hannon M. Harada J.J. Goldberg R.B. Jacobsen S.E.

Though maternal expression of MEA and FWA is controlled by DME, there are important distinctions regarding the regulation of expression of these genes. FWA is silent in all vegetative and reproductive tissues except for expression of the maternal allele in the female gametophyte and endosperm (Kinoshita et al., 2004Kinoshita T. Miura A. Choi Y.

Cell. 2000; 6: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). MEA is imprinted in the endosperm but is biallelically expressed in the embryo and in other sporophytic tissues (Kinoshita et al., 2004Kinoshita T. Miura A. Choi Y. Kinoshita Y. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E. Fischer R.L. Kakutani T.

Expression of MEA in the embryo is likely not under DME control as DME expression is not detected in the egg cell or embryo (Choi et al., 2002Choi Y. Gehring M. Johnson L. Hannon M. Harada J.J.

Expression of FWA in the endosperm and elsewhere in the plant is associated with hypomethylation of repeats in the 5′ region of the gene (Kinoshita et al., 2004Kinoshita T. Miura A. Choi Y.

Paternal inheritance of met1 releases FWA paternal-allele silencing in the endosperm and embryo (Kinoshita et al., 2004Kinoshita T. Miura A. Choi Y. Kinoshita Y. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E. Fischer R.L. Kakutani T.

MET1 is the homolog of Dnmt1 (Bender, 2004Bender J. DNA methylation and epigenetics.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). DME, MEA, and MET1 genetically interact in the female gametophyte. MEA is an E(Z) homolog that functions in a PcG complex along with FIE (Kohler et al., 2003aKohler C. Hennig L. Bouveret R. Gheyselinck J. Grossniklaus U. Gruissem W.

Seed abortion caused by dme is suppressed by maternally inherited met1 if a wild-type maternal MEA allele is present (Xiao et al., 2003Xiao W. Gehring M. Choi Y. Margossian L. Pu H. Harada J.J. Goldberg R.B. Pennell R.I. Fischer R.L. Imprinting of the MEA Polycomb gene is controlled by antagonism between MET1 methyltransferase and DME glycosylase.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, met1 can restore MEA expression in dme mutants (Xiao et al., 2003Xiao W. Gehring M. Choi Y. Margossian L. Pu H. Harada J.J. Goldberg R.B. Pennell R.I. Fischer R.L. Imprinting of the MEA Polycomb gene is controlled by antagonism between MET1 methyltransferase and DME glycosylase.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which DME activates MEA is uncertain, although it is known that the glycosylase activity of DME is necessary for seed viability and activation of MEA transcription (Choi et al., 2004Choi Y. Harada J.J. Goldberg R.B. Fischer R.L. An invariant aspartic acid in the DNA glycosylase domain of DEMETER is necessary for transcriptional activation of the imprinted MEDEA gene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DME could antagonize MET1 by specifically removing 5-methylcytosine from MEA in the central cell, allowing the maternal MEA allele to be expressed there before fertilization and in the endosperm after fertilization. Here we report that, in wild-type seeds, the maternal endosperm allele was hypomethylated compared to the paternal endosperm allele. Hypomethylation was not observed in dme mutant endosperm, suggesting that, in the central cell, DME is responsible for the removal of MEA DNA methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, DME with an active DNA glycosylase domain can excise 5-methylcytosine in vitro and when expressed in E. coli. We also found that paternal MEA allele expression is not subject to the same controls as the maternal MEA allele. Rather, Polycomb group proteins that are expressed from the maternal genome, including MEA, silence the paternal MEA allele, a novel example of self-imprinting. Four regions around the MEA locus were previously shown to be methylated: a helitron DNA transposon element (Kapitonov and Jurka, 2001Kapitonov V.V. Jurka J. Rolling-circle transposons in eukaryotes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 8714-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), AtREP2, about 4 kb 5′ of the start site (Xiao et al., 2003Xiao W.

Harada J.J. Goldberg R.B. Pennell R.I. Fischer R.L. Imprinting of the MEA Polycomb gene is controlled by antagonism between MET1 methyltransferase and DME glycosylase.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar); and seven ∼182 bp direct repeats 3′ of the gene, termed MEA-ISR (Cao and Jacobsen, 2002Cao X. Jacobsen S.E. Locus-specific control of asymmetric and CpNpG methylation by the DRM and CMT3 methyltransferase genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 16491-16498Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Here we show that bisulfite sequencing covering 91% of the CG sites in the MEA coding region did not reveal any additional methylated cytosines (Figure 1A). To see whether DME antagonizes MET1 by removing MEA DNA methylation in the central cell, we compared the methylation of maternal and paternal alleles in the embryo and endosperm of seeds dissected between 7 and 8 days after pollination (DAP). Allele-specific methylation was determined in reciprocal crosses between the accessions Columbia with the glabrous mutation (Col-gl) and RLD and between Landsberg with the erecta mutation (Ler) and RLD. This allowed us to discount any methylation effects due to natural variation or the direction of the cross. Maternal and paternal alleles could be distinguished after sequencing because of polymorphisms between RLD and Col-gl/Ler near the regions of methylation. The three accessions used in this study have similar levels of MEA methylation in leaves with one exception: Ler consistently has much lower levels of CG methylation in the −500 bp region (Table S1). In a cross between a Col-gl female and a RLD male, the −4 kb transposon element was highly methylated on both maternal and paternal embryo and endosperm alleles (Figure 1B). The −3 kb region exhibited low levels of methylation on all alleles (Figure 1B). However, the maternal endosperm allele was hypomethylated at the −500 bp (13% CG) region compared to the paternal endosperm allele (54%) and the maternal (96%) and paternal (87%) embryo alleles (Figure 1B). The same relationship was observed at the MEA-ISR. The maternal endosperm allele had 20% CG methylation compared to the paternal endosperm allele, which had 83%, and maternal and paternal embryo alleles, with 80% and 85% CG methylation, respectively (Figure 1B). The −500 bp region and MEA-ISR were also maternally hypomethylated in the endosperm of the reciprocal cross with RLD as the female and Col-gl as the male (Table S2). Maternal endosperm alleles also had low levels of methylation at the −500 bp region and MEA-ISR in reciprocal crosses between Ler and RLD (Table S2). However, consistent with the data from rosette leaves (Table S1), the −500 bp region had low levels of methylation on any allele inherited from the Ler background, whether from the male or female parent, embryo, or endosperm (Table S2). Thus, though there are differences in MEA DNA methylation attributable to the accession (Tables S1 and S2), each accession examined had at least one region of allele-specific DNA hypomethylation in the endosperm (Figure 1B and Table S2). If DME is responsible for hypomethylation of MEA in the female gametophyte, then dme mutant endosperm should, in comparison, inherit hypermethylated maternal MEA alleles from dme central cells. We crossed dme-2 heterozygous mutant females in both the Col-gl and Ler backgrounds to wild-type RLD males and analyzed methylation of maternal and paternal alleles from dme mutant endosperm 9 or 10 DAP. Compared to maternal-allele methylation in wild-type endosperm, we found a substantial increase in maternal-allele CG methylation in both the −500 bp (76% versus 13% for wild-type) and MEA-ISR (89% versus 20% for wild-type) regions in crosses with dme in a Col-gl background (Figure 2A). In crosses with dme in a Ler background, methylation on the maternal allele increased at the MEA-ISR (84% versus 18% for wild-type) but not in the −500 bp region (1% versus 22% for wild-type) (Figure 2B). We expected no change for the −500 bp region in the dme Ler mutant because there is very little methylation there for DME to act on in wild-type (Tables S1 and S2). We conclude that, in wild-type, DME DNA glycosylase is responsible for hypomethylation of the maternal endosperm allele observed at the MEA-ISR in the Col-gl, Ler, and RLD backgrounds and for hypomethylation of the −500 bp region in Col-gl and RLD. DME is related to DNA glycosylases (Choi et al., 2002Choi Y. Gehring M. Johnson L. Hannon M. Harada J.J. Goldberg R.B. Jacobsen S.E. Fischer R.L.

Jiricny J. Recent progress in the biology, chemistry and structural biology of DNA glycosylases.Bioessays. 2001; 23: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of bifunctional DNA glycosylases is well known (Scharer and Jiricny, 2001Scharer O.D. Jiricny J. Recent progress in the biology, chemistry and structural biology of DNA glycosylases.Bioessays. 2001; 23: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A conserved aspartic acid acquires a proton from a conserved lysine residue that attacks the C1′ carbon of the deoxyribose ring, creating a covalent DNA-enzyme intermediate (Figure 3A). β or δ elimination reactions release the enzyme from the DNA and cleave one of the phosphodiester bonds (Figure 3A). Cleavage 5′ to the abasic site of the β or δ elimination produced by an AP endonuclease generates a 3′-hydroxyl used by a DNA repair polymerase that inserts the proper nucleotide, and a DNA ligase seals the nick. We expressed in E. coli an 1192 amino acid portion of DME that lacks 537 amino-terminal amino acids (Δ537DME) but includes the predicted DNA glycosylase domain. Δ537DME was fused to the maltose binding protein (MBP). MBP-Δ537DME was purified over an amylose column (Figure S1) and is referred to as wild-type DME. For control experiments, we expressed and purified mutant forms of DME where the invariant aspartic acid at position 1304 was converted to asparagine (D1304N) or the lysine at position 1286 was converted to glutamine (K1286Q). Both mutations reduce DNA glycosylase activity while preserving enzyme structure and stability (Fromme et al., 2004Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Huang S.J. Verdine G.L.

Structural and biochemical exploration of a critical amino acid in human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We incubated DME with various double-strand oligonucleotides (Figure 3B) to understand its biochemical mechanism. DME breaks the phosphodiester linkage on the 3′ side of a 5-methylcytosine residue (hemimethylated substrate) and generates end-labeled DNAs that migrate on denaturing polyacrylamide gels at the predicted position for β elimination products (Figure 3C). The subsequent cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage on the 5′ side yields δ elimination products through the same mechanism found in related DNA glycosylases (Bhagwat and Gerlt, 1996Bhagwat M. Gerlt J.A. 3′- and 5′-strand cleavage reactions catalyzed by the Fpg protein from Escherichia coli occur via successive β- and δ-elimination mechanisms, respectively.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Treatment of products with strong base (NaOH) prior to gel electrophoresis confirmed the δ elimination process at the predicted position (Figure 3C). Consistent with the reaction mechanism for a bifunctional DNA glycosylase/lyase (Figure 3A), products treated with a reducing agent (NaBH4) migrated in the predicted region for trapped enzyme-DNA complexes (∼200 kDa), suggesting that the Schiff base intermediate between DME and a ring-opened sugar is covalently reduced (Figure 3D). No lyase activity (Figure 3E) or covalent trapping (Figure 3D) was detected when DME was incubated with nonmethylated oligonucleotides or when hemimethylated substrate was incubated with no enzyme or mutant enzymes (D1304N or K1286Q). Plants have 5-methylcytosine in the three sequence contexts: CpG, CpNpG, and CpNpN (Bender, 2004Bender J. DNA methylation and epigenetics.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). DME has activity on 5-methylcytosine in each of these sequence contexts (Figure 3E). We detected no DME activity when single-stranded oligonucleotides with 5-methylcytosine were used in the reaction (data not shown). These results show that DME is a bifunctional DNA glycosylase/lyase with activity on 5-methylcytosine substrates. 5-methylcytosine is mutagenic because it spontaneously deaminates to form thymine, generating a T/G mismatch. Deamination can also occur enzymatically by cytosine deaminase, a process that may play a role in mammalian epigenetic reprogramming and cell plasticity (Morgan et al., 2004Morgan H.D. Dean W. Coker H.A. Reik W. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase deaminates 5-methylcytosine in DNA and is expressed in pluripotent tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52353-52360Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Specific DNA glycosylases initiate DNA repair by excising T from T/G mispairs (Scharer and Jiricny, 2001Scharer O.D. Jiricny J. Recent progress in the biology, chemistry and structural biology of DNA glycosylases.Bioessays. 2001; 23: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We found that DME also is a thymine DNA glycosylase. DME activity on T/G mispairs is somewhat less than its activity on meC/G base pairs (Figure 3E and data not shown). DME also forms a trapped enzyme-DNA complex with DNA containing a T/G base pair (Figure 3D). DME could cause hypomethylation of the maternal MEA alleles in the endosperm using two different mechanisms. DME might excise 5-methylcytosine, leading to its replacement with unmethylated cytosine, or DME might excise thymine from a T/G mismatch formed from deamination of 5-methylcytosine. To distinguish between these two mechanisms, we sequenced DNA from dme mutant endosperm. If DME excised thymine instead of 5-methylcytosine, we expected to find numerous C→T transitions at CG sites in the −500 bp region and MEA-ISR, which are hypomethylated in wild-type endosperm (Figure 1 and Figure 2). However, no C→T transitions were found (Figure S2). Thus, the thymine DNA glycosylase activity of DME is likely not responsible for maternal MEA allele hypomethylation. When expressing DME from an IPTG-inducible promoter, we found that DME was toxic to E. coli K-12 strains in an IPTG-concentration-dependent manner (Figures 4A and 4C). The toxicity of DME expression was significantly increased in a strain bearing mutations in two AP endonuclease genes (xth and nfo) (Cunningham et al., 1986Cunningham R.P. Saporito S.M. Spitzer S.G. Weiss B. Endonuclease IV (nfo) mutant of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which remove abasic sites and trim the 3′ structure of nicks. This result suggests that DME DNA glycosylase and/or lyase activity is toxic, perhaps due to the formation of mutagenic abasic sites and/or nicks in the E. coli genome. Indeed, expression of inactive DME(D1304N) was nontoxic in xth nfo mutants or the isogenic wild-type background (Figure 4B). DME has in vitro 5-methylcytosine activity (Figures 3C–3E), and E. coli K-12 strains have 5-methylcytosine in their genomes. Perhaps DME produces deleterious abasic sites in E. coli by excising 5-methylcytosine at a genome-wide level. We tested this hypothesis by expressing DME in a dcm mutant strain (Palmer and Marinus, 1994Palmer B.R. Marinus M.G. The dam and dcm strains of Escherichia coli - a review.Gene. 1994; 143: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), which has no 5-methylcytosine in its genome. DME expression was not toxic to dcm bacteria compared to expression in the isogenic wild-type strain (Figure 4C). Expression of inactive DME(D1304N) had no effect on either strain (Figure 4D). This suggests that 5-methylcytosine is a substrate for DME in E. coli K-12 bacteria. Excision of 5-methylcytosine from fully me"

Although speciation under sympatric conditions seems theoretically possible, empirical studies are scarce and only a few credible examples of sympatric speciation exist. Here we present a convincing case of sympatric speciation in the Midas cichlid species complex (Amphilophus sp.) in a young and small volcanic crater lake in Nicaragua. Our study includes phylogeographic, population-genetic (based on mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphisms), morphometric and ecological analyses. We find, first, that crater Lake Apoyo was seeded only once by the ancestral high-bodied benthic species Amphilophus citrinellus, the most common cichlid species in the area; second, that a new elongated limnetic species (Amphilophus zaliosus) evolved in Lake Apoyo from the ancestral species (A. citrinellus) within less than approximately 10,000 yr; third, that the two species in Lake Apoyo are reproductively isolated; and fourth, that the two species are eco-morphologically distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2025851491,"Numerous human diseases are associated with the chronic expression of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins. The expansion of polyglutamine residues in unrelated proteins is associated with the early onset of neurodegenerative disease. To understand how the presence of misfolded proteins leads to cellular dysfunction, we employed Caenorhabditis elegans polyglutamine aggregation models. Here, we find that polyglutamine expansions disrupted the global balance of protein folding quality control, resulting in the loss of function of diverse metastable proteins with destabilizing temperature-sensitive mutations. In turn, these proteins, although innocuous under normal physiological conditions, enhanced the aggregation of polyglutamine proteins. Thus, weak folding mutations throughout the genome can function as modifiers of polyglutamine phenotypes and toxicity."

Dendritic cell-specific ICAM3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), abundant in immature dendritic cells, was previously reported as being an ancillary receptor interacting with the surface of DENV. The structure of DENV in complex with the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of DC-SIGN was determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 25 Å resolution. One CRD monomer was found to bind to two glycosylation sites at Asn67 of two neighboring glycoproteins in each icosahedral asymmetric unit, leaving the third Asn67 residue vacant. The vacancy at the third Asn67 site is a result of the nonequivalence of the glycoprotein environments, leaving space for the primary receptor binding to domain III of E. The use of carbohydrate moieties for receptor binding sites suggests a mechanism for avoiding immune surveillance.

The use of carbohydrate moieties for receptor binding sites suggests a mechanism for avoiding immune surveillance. Dengue virus (DENV), belonging to the flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, is an arthropod-borne human pathogen, causing more than 50 million human infections each year (Lindenbach and Rice, 2001Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Flaviviridae: the viruses and their replication.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 991-1041Google Scholar). Sequential infections by any of the four DENV serotypes can cause severe symptoms, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, probably via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (Morens, 1994Morens D.M. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection and the pathogenesis of viral disease.Clin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 19: 500-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, it is necessary to block infection by all four DENV serotypes if secondary infections due to ADE are to be avoided. Therefore, the development of vaccines against dengue virus is a nontrivial issue. Mature DENV is roughly spherical and approximately 500 Å in diameter (Kuhn et al., 2002Kuhn R.J. Zhang W.

The crystal structure of the E protein showed that it has three domains, the N-terminal structurally central domain I, the dimerization domain II, and the C-terminal, Ig-like domain III (Rey et al., 1995Rey F.A.

By combining cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) results with the crystal structure of the E protein, it was shown that the icosahedral asymmetric unit consists of three E monomers (Kuhn et al., 2002Kuhn R.J. Zhang W. Rossmann M.G. Pletnev S.V. Corver J. Lenches E. Jones C.T. Mukhopadhyay S. Chipman P.R.

One monomer, together with its icosahedral 2-fold related counterpart, forms an “icosahedral dimer.” The other two monomers form a dimer at a general position (the “general dimer”). Two potential N-linked carbohydrate sites, at Asn67 and Asn153, are both glycosylated in DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) (strain PR159-S1), but in the homologous West Nile virus (WNV) there is only one glycosylation site at residue Asn154 (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2003Mukhopadhyay S.

A difference cryoEM map between DENV2 and WNV established the locations of the carbohydrate sites in these viruses, which were found to be consistent with the fitting of the E proteins. The E protein undergoes significant conformational changes, centered around a hinge between domains I+III and domain II, during the viral life cycle (Zhang et al., 2003bZhang Y. Corver J.

DENV is transmitted between humans via mosquito vectors (Lindenbach and Rice, 2001Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Flaviviridae: the viruses and their replication.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 991-1041Google Scholar). Immature dendritic cells (DCs) and Langerhans cells, resident in skin, are the initial target cells of DENV infection (Wu et al., 2000Wu S.J. Grouard-Vogel G. Sun W. Mascola J.R. Brachtel E. Putvatana R. Louder M.K. Filgueira L. Marovich M.A. Wong H.K. et al.Human skin Langerhans cells are targets of dengue virus infection.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). DENV enters these cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis (Lindenbach and Rice, 2001Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Flaviviridae: the viruses and their replication.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 991-1041Google Scholar). However, the primary receptors of DENV are still unknown. Recent studies have shown that DENV infection can be inhibited by soluble extracellular dendritic cell-specific ICAM3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) as well as by antibodies against DC-SIGN (Navarro-Sanchez et al., 2003Navarro-Sanchez E. Altmeyer R. Amara A. Schwartz O. Fieschi F. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Desprès P. Dendritic-cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin is essential for the productive infection of human dendritic cells by mosquito-cell-derived dengue viruses.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, Tassaneetrithep et al., 2003Tassaneetrithep B.

Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). This suggests an essential role of DC-SIGN in the DENV infection of immature DCs. However, the endocytosis of DC-SIGN itself is not required for the internalization of DENV into cells (Lozach et al., 2005Lozach P.-Y. Burleigh L. Staropoli I. Navarro-Sanchez E. Harriague J. Virelizier J.-L. Rey F.A. Desprès P. Arenzanz-Seisdedos F. Amara A. Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN)–mediated enhancement of dengue virus infection is independent of DC-SIGN internalization signals.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23698-23708Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN, a carbohydrate binding, C-type, lectin-like molecule, is involved in cell adhesion but can also function as a phagocytic pathogen-recognition receptor in the immune system (Cambi and Figdor, 2003Cambi A. Figdor C.G. Dual function of C-type lectin-like receptors in the immune system.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, DC-SIGN can be used as the binding target prior to cell entry by many viral pathogens, including hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus (Lozach et al., 2003Lozach P.-Y.

DC-SIGN is composed of a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, an extacellular neck domain of eight tandem 23-amino acid residue repeats, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (Figure 1). DC-SIGN is a tetramer on DC surfaces (Bernhard et al., 2004Bernhard O.K. Lai J. Wilkinson J. Sheil M.M. Cunningham A.L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51828-51835Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) formed by the neck domain repeats, whereas isolated CRDs are monomeric (Mitchell et al., 2001Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J.

These show that the CRD has the characteristic C-type lectin fold (Weis et al., 1991Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A.

Several loops are clustered at one face of the CRD, forming the oligosaccharide binding site that is away from the N and C termini (Figure 1B).

The instability of virus-receptor complexes is the result not only of weak affinity between the virus and receptor but also the fact that recognition of a host cell by a virus initiates cell entry and uncoating of the viral capsid to release the genome. Picornaviruses, unlike DENV, do not have a lipid envelope nor are their surfaces glycosylated, making virus-receptor recognition dependent mostly on protein-protein interactions. We report here the cryoEM reconstruction of DENV2 in complex with the CRD of human DC-SIGN at 25 Å resolution. This is the first structural investigation of an intact lipid-enveloped virus interacting with a protein receptor molecule that recognizes a specific site on the virus surface. The structure shows that monomeric CRD of DC-SIGN binds to the N-linked glycans at Asn67 of each of two neighboring E proteins. The N termini of CRDs in intact DC-SIGN connect to the cell membrane through the tetrameric neck segment. The termini of two adjacent, icosahedral, 2-fold-related CRDs are close to each other, possibly making a complex as suggested by a tetrameric model of DC-SIGN (Feinberg et al., 2005Feinberg H. Guo Y.

The biological activity of the refolded CRD of DC-SIGN, expressed in E. coli, was verified by an ELISA experiment that determined the binding affinity of the CRD to DENV (Table 1). This demonstrated that the DC-SIGN sample was able to bind to DENV (see Experimental Procedures). The 25 Å resolution cryoEM reconstruction of the DENV-CRD complex showed 60 icosahedrally arranged protrusions on the external surface of DENV (Figure 2A). These protrusions were at 3.6 σ above the mean and were the highest peak in a difference map of the complex minus DENV. The next highest peak located outside the E protein shell was 2.2 σ. Thus, these protrusions are probably CRD molecules bound to DENV. The height of the density corresponding to the CRD molecules is about half of the densities of the E glycoproteins in the cryoEM reconstruction of the complex. Hence, some of the CRD binding sites are probably unoccupied, or the CRD molecules have considerable variation in their position on the viral surface. Fitting the known atomic structure of one CRD monomer into a single protrusion of the difference map gave a far better result as determined by the parameters shown in Table 2 than fitting of two closely packed CRD monomers into the same density.Table 1Binding Activity of Recombinant DC-SIGN CRD to DENV as determined by an Elisa ExperimentDC-SIGN CRD + DENV+ (Positive Test)DC-SIGN CRD+ DENV− (Negative Control 1)DC-SIGN CRD − DENV+ (Negative Control 2)0.37 ± 0.080.08 ± 0.050.05 ± 0.05The values shown are average optical densities measured at 405 nm for three experiments.

The orientation and position of E dimers fitted into the cryoEM map of the complex were similar to the E dimers fitted into a 25 Å resolution cryoEM reconstruction of mature DENV (Table 3), showing that the E molecule does not undergo any significant conformational changes on binding to CRD. This might be because DC-SIGN is merely an attachment receptor and probably functions to concentrate viruses on cell membranes rather than being the mediator required for subsequent endocytosis of DENV into cells (Lozach et al., 2005Lozach P.-Y.

Thus, it is possible that binding of full-length DC-SIGN, as opposed to CRD alone, might trigger changes on the virus or initiate clustering of a yet unidentified primary receptor molecule, leading to endocytosis.Table 3Fitting of the E Dimers into the DENV-CRD Complex and into Mature DENV Maps at 25 Å ResolutionMapModelSumfaParameters are described in Table 2.ClashaParameters are described in Table 2.-DenaParameters are described in Table 2.Orientation (°)Center (Å)RadiusbThe radius of the mass center of the fitted E dimer in the virus particle after the magnification of the complex map was adjusted (see Experimental Procedures).θ1θ2θ3xaParameters are described in Table 2.yaParameters are described in Table 2.zaParameters are described in Table 2.ComplexIcosahedral Dimer70.70.00.0−0.20.00.00.00.0220.5220.5General Dimer78.40.80.843.546.8135.043.8−31.1211.0217.7DENVIcosahedral Dimer60.80.04.41.80.00.00.00.0219.5219.5General Dimer60.70.73.445.045.0135.042.8−31.1210.0216.6a Parameters are described in Table 2.b The radius of the mass center of the fitted E dimer in the virus particle after the magnification of the complex map was adjusted (see Experimental Procedures).

https://openalex.org/W2058497055,"Although p120-catenin regulates adherens junction (AJ) stability in cultured cells, genetic studies in lower eukaryotes have not revealed a role for this protein in vivo. Using conditional targeting in mice, we show that p120 null neonatal epidermis exhibits reduced intercellular AJ components but no overt disruption in barrier function or intercellular adhesion. As the mice age, however, they display epidermal hyperplasia and chronic inflammation, typified by hair degeneration and loss of body fat. Using skin engraftments and anti-inflammatory drugs, we show that these features are not attributable to reductions in junctional cadherins and catenins, but rather NFkB activation. Both in vivo and in vitro, p120 null epidermal cells activate nuclear NFkB, triggering a cascade of proinflammatory NFkB targets. Although the underlying mechanism is likely complex, we show that p120 affects NFkB activation and immune homeostasis in part through regulation of Rho GTPases. These findings provide important new insights into p120 function."
https://openalex.org/W2079628366,"Defining the precise molecular strategies that coordinate patterns of transcriptional responses to specific signals is central for understanding normal development and homeostasis as well as the pathogenesis of hormone-dependent cancers. Here we report specific prostate cancer cell/macrophage interactions that mediate a switch in function of selective androgen receptor antagonists/modulators (SARMs) from repression to activation in vivo. This is based on an evolutionarily conserved receptor N-terminal L/HX7LL motif, selectively present in sex steroid receptors, that causes recruitment of TAB2 as a component of an N-CoR corepressor complex. TAB2 acts as a sensor for inflammatory signals by serving as a molecular beacon for recruitment of MEKK1, which in turn mediates dismissal of the N-CoR/HDAC complex and permits derepression of androgen and estrogen receptor target genes. Surprisingly, this conserved sensor strategy may have arisen to mediate reversal of sex steroid-dependent repression of a limited cohort of target genes in response to inflammatory signals, linking inflammatory and nuclear receptor ligand responses to essential reproductive functions."

VOLUME 281 (2006) PAGES 9616-9622Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 281Issue 30PreviewPAGE 9620: Full-Text PDF Open Access Elevated levels of heat shock protein expression have been identified as a biomarker for many cancers and are correlated with poor prognosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Ciocca D.R. Calderwood S.K. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2005; 10: 86-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones have diverse roles in the regulation of signal transduction and in numerous aspects of cell growth and cell death. At the level of specific chaperones, HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27 have each been implicated in promoting cancer. HSP90 regulates the activities of many signaling molecules and kinases important in cancer, including NF-κB, p53, Raf1, Akt, and steroid aporeceptors (reviewed in Ref. 2Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). In addition, HSP90, HSP70, and HSP27 have been shown to be anti-apoptotic (reviewed in Ref. 3Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Although they serve to prevent stressed primary cells from initiating cell death, in transformed cells the elevated levels of these chaperones may interfere with the proper regulation of caspase activities. Several cancer strategies have focused on the inhibition of individual chaperones. For instance, inhibition of HSP90 by the fungal antibiotic radicicol, the benzoquinone ansamycin geldanamycin, and the geldanamycin-related analog 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), which has been shown to potently reduce tumor growth, is currently in clinical trials (4Whitesell L. Bagatell R. Falsey R. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Depletion of HSP70 levels by antisense RNAs causes cell death in transformed cell lines, but not in nontransformed cells, and inhibits tumorigenesis in xenograft models (5Nylandsted J. Rohde M.

Weller M. Jaattela M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7139-7142PubMed Google Scholar). Similar anti-cancer effects have also been observed with antisense RNA against HSP27 (7Rocchi P. So A. Kojima S. Signaevsky M. Beraldi E. Fazli L. Hurtado-Coll A. Yamanaka K. Gleave M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6595-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The regulation of heat shock gene expression is complex and involves a multitude of promoter elements that confer responses to specific signals and growth factors (8Wu B.J. Kingston R.E. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 9Wu B.J. Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Common to all heat shock-induced genes are heat shock elements, promoter sites that have high affinity for binding to a family of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs). 4The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat shock factor; HSP, heat shock protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RT, reverse transcription; TBP, TATA-binding protein. HSF1 is well characterized and is essential for the heat shock response (reviewed in Ref. 13Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Upon induction by diverse stimuli, HSF1 trimerizes and binds to the promoters of target genes. HSF1 must be hyperphosphorylated to become transcriptionally activated and induce a rapid and coordinate increase in molecular chaperone levels. Elevated levels of chaperones allow for recognition and processing of misfolded polypeptides that appear in stressed cells and promote recovery from protein damage. In addition to the many known activators of the heat shock response, including elevated temperature, heavy metals, oxidants, and a variety of small molecules (reviewed in Ref. 14Westerheide S.D. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33097-33100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), various disease states are also correlated with altered molecular chaperone expression levels, including inflammation, ischemia, tissue wounding and repair, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the levels of chaperones and the relative proportions of individual chaperones within chaperone networks may be critical in determining the state of the cell. The recent evidence that HSF1 levels and activities are up-regulated in certain cancers (15Hoang A.T. Huang J. Rudra-Ganguly N. Zheng J. Powell W.C. Rabindran S.K. Wu C. Roy-Burman P. Am. J.

A logical direction, therefore, would be at the level of pharmacological control of heat shock gene expression. Although many classes of inducers of the heat shock response are known, only a small number of inhibitors have been identified. These include quercetin, a flavonoid found in apples, onions, and black tea, which was shown to decrease HSF1 activity and HSP70 expression (18Hosokawa N. Hirayoshi K. Nakai A. Hosokawa Y. Marui N.

Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) using a 32P-labeled probe containing the proximal heat shock element from the human HSP70.1 gene promoter. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase. Analysis of RNA was performed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The HSP70 primers were: 5′-AGAGCCGAGCCGACAGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACCTTGCCGTGTTGGAA-3′ (reverse). The 18S rRNA primers were: 5′-CGTCTGCCCTATCAACTTTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCCTTCCTTGGATGTGGTAG-3′ (reverse). PCR reactions were carried out for 25 cycles. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed using the Odyssey system (Li-COR, Lincoln, NE). The HSF1 r2 antibody (31Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:5,000 dilution. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions were performed as described previously (28Westerheide S.D. Bosman J.D. Mbadugha B.N. Kawahara T.L. Matsumoto G. Kim S. Gu W. Devlin J.P. Silverman R.B. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56053-56060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). HeLa S3 cells exposed to the indicated treatments were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, sonicated, and immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of HSF1 r2 antibody at 4 °C overnight. PCR analysis was performed on DNA isolated from the immunoprecipitated protein using primers specific to the HSP70.1 promoter. The primers used were 5′-GGCGAAACCCCTGGAATATTCCCGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCCTTGGGACAACGGGAG-3′ (reverse). Cytoprotection Analysis—HeLa cells, HSF1 wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HSF1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts were pretreated as indicated, washed, and allowed to recover for 5 h prior to a 45 °C heat shock for 40 min (HeLa cells) or 20 min (mouse embryonic fibroblasts). The cells were then assayed for the percentage of cell death by trypan blue uptake 24 h after the 45 °C heat shock treatment. Triptolide Inhibits Activation of the Heat Shock Response—Triptolide (Fig. 1) was shown to inhibit the heat shock response in a HeLa cell line stably expressing a human HSP70 promoter-luciferase reporter (Fig. 1B) that allows for efficient and reproducible screening for small molecule regulators (28Westerheide S.D. Bosman J.D. Mbadugha B.N. Kawahara T.L. Matsumoto G. Kim S. Gu W. Devlin J.P. Silverman R.B. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56053-56060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Using this system, a 1-h heat shock at 42 °C followed by 8 h of recovery prior to luciferase analysis was found to provide optimal reporter activity (data not shown). To test the effect of triptolide on induction of the HSP70 promoter, HeLa HSP70-luc cells were incubated with triptolide at increasing concentrations from 10 to 100 nm delivered into the tissue culture medium for 1 h prior to heat shock (Fig. 1C). Although triptolide on its own did not activate the reporter (Fig. 1C, lane 2), triptolide treatment prior to heat shock was shown to suppress activation of the HSP70 reporter in a dose-dependent manner, with 100 nm triptolide pretreatment resulting in an ∼80% inhibition (compare lane 3 with lane 6). Thus, triptolide effectively blocks heat shock induction of the HSP70 promoter-luciferase reporter. We next tested the effect of triptolide in HeLa cells on the inducible expression of the endogenous HSP70 gene using the same pretreatment and heat shock regimen. To measure HSP70 mRNA levels, the treated cells were immediately harvested following heat shock, and HSP70 mRNA was quantified by RT-PCR (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the results obtained using the HSP70 promoter-reporter construct, triptolide pretreatment completely suppressed the expression of HSP70 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner, with 100 nm triptolide reducing the level of HSP70 mRNA below that of untreated cells (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lane 5). To see whether the effect of triptolide is conserved across species, we also tested for inhibition of heat shock-induced Hsp70 levels in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (Fig. 1E). Triptolide was equally effective as an inhibitor in this system as well. Thus, triptolide pretreatment can effectively abrogate induction of HSP70 mRNA accumulation by heat shock in both human and mouse cell lines. We next addressed whether triptolide had general effects on other inducible transcription systems. ZnSO4 treatment induces multiple stress responsive genes, including in heat shock protein genes in an HSF1-dependent manner and in metallothionein genes in a metal response element-binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1)-dependent manner (32Westin G. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3763-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This affords the opportunity to address the specificity of triptolide on both inducible systems at the same time. Thus, we tested the ability of triptolide to inhibit ZnSO4-induced HSP70 mRNA versus metallothionein IIA (MTIIA) mRNA. HeLa cells were pretreated with or without 100 nm of triptolide for 1 h followed by treatment with 100 μm ZnSO4 for 2 h. RNA was then harvested, and the levels of HSP70 and MTIIA mRNA were tested by RT-PCR. Our results clearly show that triptolide only affects the metal induction of HSP70, with no effects on inducible MTIIA expression levels (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, triptolide shows specificity toward HSF1 signaling versus MTF-1 signaling. Triptolide Does Not Affect HSF1 DNA Binding and Hyperphosphorylation—To identify the step in the heat shock response affected by triptolide, we next focused on the steps involved in the stress-induced activation of HSF1, including formation of DNA-binding trimers and hyperphosphorylation. We first performed electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays (EMSA) to explore whether the inhibitory effect of triptolide is at the level of HSF1 DNA binding. Cells treated either with a 42 °C heat shock for various times or with 100 nm triptolide prior to a 42 °C heat shock were harvested and assayed by EMSA using a 32P-labeled probe containing the proximal heat shock element from the human HSP70 gene promoter (Fig. 2A). Low levels of HSF1 DNA binding activity are detected in control, unstressed cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1), and upon heat shock there is a strong activation of HSF1 DNA binding activity due to HSF1 trimer formation (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-6). The levels of heat shock-induced HSF1 binding were not affected by triptolide pretreatment (Fig. 2A, lanes 7-11), revealing that the triptolide effect on the heat shock response is not at the level of inhibition of HSF1 DNA binding. We next investigated another well established step in activation of HSF1 corresponding to stress-induced hyperphosphorylation, which can be detected readily by electrophoretic retardation on SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (33Holmberg C.I. Tran S.E. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). HeLa cells exposed to either heat shock or sequential triptolide followed by heat shock regimens were harvested and assayed for the shift in HSF1 mobility indicative of hyperphosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2B, the HSF1 induced in triptolide-treated cells exhibited the same retarded mobility on SDS-PAGE (compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 was unaffected by triptolide. From these results, we can conclude that triptolide does not disrupt acquisition of DNA binding and hyperphosphorylation in the early steps of HSF1 activation. Having demonstrated that triptolide did not interfere with the appearance of the DNA binding-competent state of HSF1, we next assessed whether activated HSF1 was in the nucleus and bound to the endogenous HSP70 promoter. Whereas the EMSA assay is an in vitro assay that detects only total available amounts of a DNA binding-competent transcription factor using a DNA binding assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays detect the in vivo recruitment of transcription factors to promoter sequences. Chromatin immunoprecipitation using an HSF1 antibody was performed on cells treated with either heat shock or triptolide pretreatment followed by heat shock. The samples were then analyzed by PCR with primers specific for the HSP70 promoter to determine the relative amounts of HSF1 bound (Fig. 2C). These results show the increased binding of heat shock-induced HSF1 to the HSP70 promoter (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4) and show that triptolide does not inhibit the in vivo recruitment of HSF1 to the HSP70 promoter (Fig. 2C, lanes 6 and 7). Taken together with the previous results, these data confirm that triptolide does not inhibit HSF1 trimer formation, hyperphosphorylation of HSF1, or translocation and binding of HSF1 in the nucleus to the endogenous HSP70 gene promoter. Triptolide Inhibits the Transactivation Domain of HSF1—Because triptolide inhibits HSF1 activation without altering its DNA binding activity or subsequent hyperphosphorylation, we extended our analysis to examine the effect of triptolide on the transactivation function of DNA-bound HSF1. We transiently cotransfected 293T cells with plasmids encoding a GAL4-HSF1 chimera and GAL4-luciferase reporter. In the GAL4-HSF1 chimera, the DNA binding domain of HSF1 is replaced by the DNA binding domain of GAL4, allowing the analysis of regulatory events downstream of HSF1 DNA binding. The GAL4-HSF1 fusion system has previously been utilized in our laboratory to delineate the C-terminal transactivation domain of HSF1 and the negative regulatory domain (29Shi Y. Kroeger P.E. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 293T cells, employed in this assay because of their high transfection efficiency, respond in a similar fashion to heat shock as HeLa cells (data not shown). Transfected cells were subjected to either heat shock alone or sequential exposure to triptolide followed by heat shock and were assayed for luciferase activity (Fig. 3). Triptolide incubation prior to heat shock results in an 11-fold inhibition of heat shock-induced activity (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 4). From these results, we conclude that the inhibitory effect of triptolide is at the level of transcription by interfering with the proper activity of the C-terminal transactivation domain of HSF1. Triptolide Is a Reversible Inhibitor of the Heat Shock Response—An irreversible inhibitor of the heat shock response is likely to be harmful to a cell or organism. Permanent effects could occur if the transcriptionally arrested HSF1 persists in an inert complex bound to the endogenous HSP70 promoter or if triptolide is sequestered in the nucleus of treated cells. Alternatively, if the compound is degraded or readily released from the cell, the effect of triptolide could be transient. This latter possibility would predict that the heat shock response should be restored upon removal of triptolide from the medium. To test whether the effect of triptolide is reversible, HeLa cells were treated with 100 nm triptolide for 1 h, after which the cells were washed of the triptolide-containing medium and replaced with fresh medium for periods ranging from 0 to 4 h, subjected to heat shock, and harvested for analysis of HSP70 mRNA levels (Fig. 4). Using RT-PCR to measure the levels of HSP70 mRNA, we showed that triptolide is not an irreversible inhibitor. A period of at least 4 h following triptolide treatment is necessary for the complete restoration of the heat shock response (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and 6). From these results, we conclude that the inhibitory effect of triptolide, while at the level of functionality of the active HSF1 complex at the HSP70 promoter, does not generate an inert, irreversible complex. Either this complex dissociates, or the inhibitory effect of triptolide itself is dynamic. Triptolide treatment, therefore, can be precisely controlled both for the level and duration of inhibition of the heat shock response. Triptolide Enhances Stress-induced Cell Death—A well established cellular phenomenon associated with the induction of the heat shock response is cytoprotection, a process in which stressed cells can acquire an enhanced capacity to survive normally lethal stress exposures (28Westerheide S.D. Bosman J.D. Mbadugha B.N. Kawahara T.L. Matsumoto G. Kim S. Gu W. Devlin J.P. Silverman R.B. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The ability of triptolide to block the cytoprotective benefits of a 42 °C heat shock administered prior to a lethal 45 °C challenge condition was investigated in HeLa cells (Fig. 5A). Similar to what has been reported previously (28Westerheide S.D. Bosman J.D. Mbadugha B.N. Kawahara T.L. Matsumoto G. Kim S. Gu W. Devlin J.P. Silverman R.B. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56053-56060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), treatment of HeLa cells with a 45 °C heat shock for 40 min resulted in 75% cell death (Fig. 5A, lane 3), whereas pretreatment of the cells with a 1-h heat shock at 42 °C prior to the lethal 45 °C challenge condition reduces cell death to 39% (Fig. 5A, lane 4). Triptolide treatment alone is neither cytoprotective nor causes cell death (Fig. 5A, lane 2). However, triptolide pretreatment prior to the cytoprotective 42 °C heat shock regimen completely blocks cytoprotection and instead results in enhanced cell death (Fig. 5A, lane 5). In fact, pretreatment with triptolide alone followed by exposure to 45 °C resulted in 100% cell death (Fig. 5A, lane 6) compared with 75% cell death when cells are directly challenged with 45 °C in the absence of any triptolide treatment (Fig. 5A, lane 3). HSF1 is required for cells to exhibit the cytoprotective benefits of a prior heat shock (38McMillan D.R. Xiao X. Shao L. Graves K. Benjamin I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7523-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects of triptolide on blocking cytoprotection depend on HSF1, we performed cytoprotection experiments utilizing HSF1 wild-type versus null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 5, B and C). As expected, a prior heat shock provides cytoprotection in the wild-type cells but not in the HSF1 null cells. Triptolide was only able to prevent cytoprotection in the wild-type cells, as no cytoprotection was observed in the HSF1 null cells. Additionally, triptolide was able to enhance cell death induced by a lethal heat shock in the wild-type cells but not in the HSF1 null cells, indicating a dependence on HSF1 for this effect. Taken together, these results show that triptolide not only effectively prevents the molecular events that result in cytoprotection, but also sensitizes cells to enhanced levels of stress-induced cell death in an HSF1-dependent mechanism. Triptolide inhibits induction of the heat shock response by blocking a step in the activation of HSF1, which, in turn, prevents the induction of molecular chaperones and thus sensitizes cells to stress-induced cell death. Our results demonstrate that triptolide affects a step in the heat shock transcriptional response after trimerization of HSF1, nuclear localization, and binding to the promoter of the endogenous HSP70 gene but prior to induction of HSP70 mRNA levels (Fig. 6). We suggest that a likely target of triptolide action is in the assembly of functional transcriptionally active HSF1 complexes on the HSP70 promoter. As one requirement of a transcriptionally active promoter is the recruitment of TBP, and HSF and TBP are known to interact (39Mason Jr., P.B. Lis J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33227-33233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we tested whether triptolide could disrupt TBP recruitment. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows that the association of TBP with the HSP70 promoter is not blocked by triptolide. 5S. D. Westerheide and R. I. Morimoto, unpublished data. Therefore, the transcriptional step that triptolide inhibits may occur post transcription factor occupancy. Triptolide is derived from T. wilfordii, the same family of plants from which celastrol was identified as a potent inducer of the heat shock response (28Westerheide S.D. Bosman J.D. Mbadugha B.N. Kawahara T.L. Matsumoto G. Kim S. Gu W. Devlin J.P. Silverman R.B. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56053-56060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that these small molecule regulators of the heat shock response could have physiological relevance in the regulation of the plant heat shock response as well. From a mechanistic perspective, triptolide is a new chemical genetic tool that may prove useful for further stepwise dissection of the heat shock transcriptional response. In this regard, triptolide complements the activity of another plant natural product, sodium salicylate. Sodium salicylate was shown previously to induce HSF1 DNA binding and occupancy but not hyperphosphorylation (40Jurivich D.A. Sistonen L. Kroes R.A. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 41Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, the HSF1 complexes induced by sodium salicylate were still “on pathway” in the HSF1 cycle and could become hyperphosphorylated by exposure to a subsequent heat shock to acquire full activity upon subsequent stress treatment. The reversible inhibition of the heat shock response by triptolide suggests that the HSF1 complexes bound to the endogenous HSP70 promoter, although nonfunctional, are nevertheless dynamic as heat shock gene transcription recovers upon removal of triptolide. Triptolide or other functionally related small molecules that act to inhibit the heat shock response may have promise as a novel class of disease therapeutics. An increasing number of disease states are associated with elevated expression of molecular chaperones and the chronic up-regulation of the heat shock response; consequently it follows that these disease states may benefit from small molecule inhibitors of chaperone expression. In the case of cancer, for instance, up-regulation of molecular chaperones is associated with oncogenesis. Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the induction of heat shock proteins is required for cells to survive the transformation process. For example, cells derived from mice deficient in HSF1 are insensitive to the oncogene H-ras, whereas wild-type cells are readily transformed (4Whitesell L. Bagatell R. Falsey R. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because both molecular chaperones and HSF1 are essential in protecting cells against proteotoxicity and have important roles in aging, a key aspect in disease therapy will be an ability to modulate the heat shock response transiently rather than to achieve permanent inhibition. The reversibility of triptolide on suppression of the heat shock response, therefore, could represent a particularly advantageous characteristic of this molecule. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of triptolide is the ability to enhance stress-induced cell death. Not only was triptolide effective in blocking the cytoprotection achieved by the transient 42 °C heat shock, but triptolide pretreatment enhanced the lethality of the 45 °C treatment. The sensitization to cell death may be because of the effects of triptolide on other cellular processes, as previous laboratories have demonstrated that triptolide can modulate the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 (24Lee K.Y.

Lam S.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8009-8018Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, because HeLa cells have a low basal level of HSF1 activity, it is also possible that this effect of triptolide occurs through the inhibition of basal expression levels of heat shock genes. Using HSF1 wild-type and null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we show that the increase in heat-induced cell death in response to triptolide is HSF1-dependent. In summary, our results suggest a role for triptolide in combination with other cancer therapies because of its role in the inhibition of molecular chaperone expression and cytoprotection.

The eIF4E binding protein Cup interacts with Bruno and inhibits oskar translation. Validating current models, we directly demonstrate the mechanism proposed for Cup-mediated repression: inhibition of small ribosomal subunit recruitment to oskar mRNA. However, 43S complex recruitment remains inhibited in the absence of functional Cup, uncovering a second Bruno-dependent silencing mechanism. This mechanism involves mRNA oligomerization and formation of large (50S-80S) silencing particles that cannot be accessed by ribosomes. Bruno-dependent mRNA oligomerization into silencing particles emerges as a mode of translational control that may be particularly suited to coupling with mRNA transport."

In both eukaryotic and bacterial cells, it is well established that DNA damage in actively transcribing genes is repaired more rapidly than in inactive regions of the genome (Bohr et al., 1985Bohr V.A.

This process, called transcription-coupled repair (TCR), is triggered by an elongating RNAP stalled at lesions in the DNA template. In contrast to the complex process of eukaryotic TCR (Svejstrup, 2002Svejstrup J.Q. Mechanisms of transcription-coupled DNA repair.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), bacteria have a simple coupling machinery comprising a single polypeptide, the superfamily 2 (SF2) Mfd ATPase (Selby and Sancar, 1993Selby C.P. Sancar A. Molecular mechanism of transcription-repair coupling.Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Isolated forty years ago, the Escherichia coli mfd mutant strain is deficient in “mutation frequency decline,” a reduction in the frequency of nonsense suppressor mutations that occurs when protein synthesis is inhibited subsequent to mutagenic treatment (Witkin, 1966Witkin E.M. Radiation-induced mutations and their repair.Science. 1966; 152: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, Bockrath and Palmer, 1977Bockrath R.C. Palmer J.E.

The mutant strain is also sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (Selby and Sancar, 1993Selby C.P. Sancar A. Molecular mechanism of transcription-repair coupling.Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and expresses SOS functions at lower UV exposures (George and Witkin, 1975George D.L.

The mfd strain lacks gene- and strand-specific DNA repair, and the Mfd protein is, in fact, the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF) (Selby and Sancar, 1993Selby C.P. Sancar A. Molecular mechanism of transcription-repair coupling.Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). TRCF was shown to be necessary and sufficient for TCR in vivo and in vitro and to express two activities: (1) relief of transcription-dependent inhibition of nucleotide excision repair (NER) by recognition and ATP-dependent removal of a stalled RNAP covering the damaged DNA; and (2) stimulation of DNA repair by recruitment of the Uvr(A)BC endonuclease (Selby and Sancar, 1990Selby C.P.

USA. 1991; 88: 11574-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Details of both steps in the coupling reaction are poorly defined, in part due to the lack of structural information on TRCF. TRCF function results in the complete dissociation of the highly stable ternary elongation complex (TEC), with release of the DNA template and RNA transcript from the RNAP. Thus, along with intrinsic termination (requiring a properly positioned RNA hairpin structure in the transcript) and ρ-dependent termination (requiring the termination factor ρ), TRCF is one of only three known transcription termination mechanisms in bacterial cells. The mechanism of TRCF-induced termination is unique—TRCF uses its ATPase motor to translocate on dsDNA upstream of the transcription bubble, inducing forward translocation of the RNAP and ultimately bubble collapse and transcript release if forward translocation of the RNAP is blocked (Park et al., 2002Park J.-S.

In contrast to RNAP release, even less is known about Uvr(A)BC recruitment by TRCF except that it relies on direct physical interaction with the UvrA subunit (Selby and Sancar, 1993Selby C.P. Sancar A. Molecular mechanism of transcription-repair coupling.Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, Selby and Sancar, 1995aSelby C.P. Sancar A.

TRCF function is not restricted to TCR but extends to cellular processes that are regulated by roadblocks to RNAP elongation, such as catabolite repression (Zalieckas et al., 1998Zalieckas J.M.

TRCF also plays a role in resolving conflicts between the transcription and DNA replication machineries (Trautinger et al., 2005Trautinger B.W. Jaktaji R.P. Rusakova E. Lloyd R.G. RNA polymerase modulators and DNA repair activities resolve conflicts between DNA replication and transcription.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To provide a structural framework for understanding TRCF-dependent processes and a guide for future studies aimed at dissecting the precise mechanism of bacterial TCR, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of full-length E. coli apo-TRCF at 3.2 Å resolution. E. coli TRCF was crystallized, and its structure was determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion using data collected from crystals of selenomethionyl-substituted TRCF (Deaconescu and Darst, 2005Deaconescu A. Darst S.A. Crystallization and preliminary structure determination of Escherichia coli Mfd, the transcription-repair coupling factor.Acta Cryst. F. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). The structure was refined to an R/Rfree of 0.234/0.295 at 3.2 Å resolution (Table 1; Figures 1A, S1, and S2). Although the asymmetric unit of the crystals contains two 130 kDa TRCF molecules, size-exclusion chromatography indicates that TRCF exists as a monomer in solution (data not shown). The two NCS-related monomers show only minor conformational variability; the α carbons of the two molecular traces are superimposable with root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.75 Å. Molecule A (average B factor = 45.72 Å2) is substantially better ordered than molecule B (average B factor = 55.22 Å2; Table S1).Table 1Crystallographic Data and Refinement Statistics for apo TRCFSpace Group: C2; Two Molecules per Asymmetric UnitCell Dimensions (Å): a = 151.9 b = 162.0 c = 161.7 β = 105.1°Wavelength (Å)0.97899R factoraRsym = Σ|I − <I>|/ΣI where I = observed intensity and <I> = average intensity of multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.23.4% (data with |F| > 0)Resolution (Å)40-3.2Rfree factorbRcryst = Σ|Fo − FcI/Σ|Fo| where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.29.5%(Outer shell)3.3-3.2(Reflections in test set)5%Reflections measured300,181Rmsd bond length (Å)0.011(Unique)122,388Rmsd bond angles (°)1.490Completeness (%)99.9(In outer shell)99.9Ramachandran plot statisticsMean I/σ(I)12.4 Residues in most favored regions80.7%(In outer shell)2.5 Residues in additional allowed regions17.9%RsymaRsym = Σ|I − <I>|/ΣI where I = observed intensity and <I> = average intensity of multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.

Open table in a new tab The TRCF structure consists of a compact but complex arrangement of eight structural domains referred to as D1a, D1b, and D2–D7 (Figures 1B, 2, and S3; Table S1). The structure resembles a tripod vessel (height = 65 Å, maximum diameter = 110 Å), with legs formed by structural elements belonging to D4, D5, and D6 and a “handle” consisting of the C-terminal D7. All domains contribute residues to the concave surface of the vessel (seen in the “top” view of the intact molecule in Figure 1B). D5 and D6 mediate contacts between the NCS-related monomers. Some of the structural domains can be grouped into functional modules. Thus, D1a/D2/D1b form the UvrB homology module (Figures 1B and 2) and are named according to the UvrB nomenclature (Theis et al., 1999Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Crystal structure of UvrB, a DNA helicase adapted for nucleotide excision repair.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As we will show below, D4 comprises an RNAP Interacting Domain (RID). D5/D6 comprise the translocation module and will be called TD1 (Translocation Domain 1) and TD2, respectively (Figures 1B and 2). Most of the modules or domains are linked with the adjacent domains or modules in the TRCF sequence by flexible linkers (Figures 1B and 2). The UvrB homology module is linked to D3 by a 13-residue, U-shaped loop (D1b-D3 linker, Figure 1B). D3 is linked to D4 by an extended 25-residue linker that traverses 40 Å from one side of the molecule to the other (D3-D4 linker). The translocation module is linked to D7 by a 25 Å, extended 12-residue loop (D6-D7 linker). The average of the atomic B factors for the linkers is substantially higher than for the domains that they link (Table S1), suggesting that these segments comprise flexible linkers connecting the functional modules. This structural architecture suggests that TRCF may undergo large-scale conformational changes during the course of its functional cycle, an idea that is supported by other structural details described below. A distinctive feature of TRCF is a long, straight α helix that serves as a key structural element connecting D4 to the translocation module (TD1/TD2; Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). This helix, which we call the relay helix (RH), is largely solvent-exposed except for interactions with two helices from TD2 that wrap around the RH to form a hook-like structure (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) reminiscent of that observed in RecG (Singleton et al., 2001Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Structural analysis of DNA replication fork reversal by RecG.Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The seven SF2 ATPase signature motifs (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Helicases: amino acid sequence comparisons and structure-function relationships.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (990) Google Scholar) of TRCF cluster together at the interface between TD1 and TD2 in an arrangement similar to that observed in other ATPases (colored red in Figure 3A). Both domains of this motor module are strikingly similar in sequence and structure to the corresponding domains of RecG, which is a key player in replication fork damage bypass (Selby and Sancar, 1993Selby C.P. Sancar A. Molecular mechanism of transcription-repair coupling.Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, Singleton et al., 2001Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Structural analysis of DNA replication fork reversal by RecG.Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). More recently, the mechanistic implications of this homology have become clear, as TRCF was shown to function, like RecG, not as a helicase but as a dsDNA translocase (Park et al., 2002Park J.-S. Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. E. coli transcription repair coupling factor (Mfd protein) rescues arrested complexes by promoting forward translocation.Cell. 2002; 109: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Despite significant effort in soaking or cocrystallization of TRCF with nucleotides or nucleotide analogs, we have been unable to collect usable crystallographic data for nucleotide bound TRCF. In order to gain insight into potential conformational rearrangements during the nucleotide hydrolysis cycle, we compared the translocation module of apo-TRCF with that of Thermotoga maritima RecG•ADP complexed with a three-way DNA junction (PDB ID 1GM5; Singleton et al., 2001Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Structural analysis of DNA replication fork reversal by RecG.Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The interdomain packing angle of TD1 and TD2 is very different in apo-TRCF, with TD2 undergoing a large 97° rotation and a centroid translation of 9 Å relative to TD1 (Figure 3A). This results in a conformation that is significantly more open compared to the one observed in RecG•ADP and may reflect the disposition of these domains before DNA binding. Unlike RecG, TRCF requires ATP for DNA binding (Selby and Sancar, 1995aSelby C.P. Sancar A. Structure and function of transcription-repair coupling factor. I. Structural domains and binding properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mutations in TRCF affecting DNA binding have not been described, and details of the path of the DNA across the translocase module have remain ill-defined. The duplex portion of the DNA substrate in the RecG structure does not extend across the translocase domains, but the availability of the crystal structure of the ATPase core of the Sulfolobus solfataricus SF2 dsDNA translocase Swi2/Snf2 bound to a 25mer DNA duplex (Durr et al., 2005Durr H. Korner C. Muller M. Hickmann V. Hopfner K.P. X-ray structures of the Sulfolobus solfataricus SWI2/SNF2 ATPase core and its complex with DNA.Cell. 2005; 121: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) allowed us to position the DNA relative to TD1 (Figure S4). Although not closely related in sequence, both Swi2/Snf2 and TRCF are SF2 dsDNA translocases that share a RecA-type catalytic core. Like RecG, Swi2/Snf2 does not require ATP to bind DNA. In the (nucleotide-free) Swi2/Snf2 DNA complex, TD2 is located such that its ATPase motifs are exposed on the surface of Swi2/Snf2 and donation of catalytic residues to the active site cleft is prevented (Figure S4). Least-square superposition of TD1 of TRCF and Swi2/Snf2 (rmsd of 5.5 Å over 147 core residues) places the DNA duplex in the TD1/TD2 interdomain groove of TRCF such that TD1 presents a positively charged patch exposing highly conserved R685, K712, and H738 along with moderately conserved Q692 and R737 (Figures 2 and S4). Compared to Swi2/Snf2, TD2 of TRCF moves away from the duplex due to a 177° rotation and a 25 Å centroid translation. This large-scale movement is articulated, as in RecG, about a hinge located in the TD1/TD2 interdomain linker (Figure 3A). This is consistent with numerous structural studies of SF1 and SF2 ATPases which demonstrate that nucleotide status controls TD1/TD2 interdomain packing angle (Caruthers and McKay, 2002Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Helicase structure and mechanism.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Superposition of TD1 and TD2 with the homologous motor domains of RecG separately reveals further conformational changes in addition to the rigid-body swiveling motion of TD2. Most striking is the RH, which in our structure is straight and rigid, while in RecG it adopts a bent conformation with maximal deviation of 22 Å at the N-terminal tip (Figure 3A). Other differences involve signature ATPase “switch” regions. In particular, nucleotide binding switch I (Walker A) is displaced, with rmsd of 2.5 Å relative to the conformation seen in RecG, and it extends into the interdomain cleft in a conformation stabilized by a salt bridge between Asp629 and Lys634 and a constellation of aromatic interactions involving Phe632, Phe599, and Phe597. In this conformation, the Walker A motif is incompatible with nucleotide binding (Figure 3B). Of particular interest to understanding the TRCF structure-function relationship are the large conformational differences seen in the TRG (translocation in RecG) motif (Figures 3C and 3D). This helical-hairpin structure is highly conserved between the RecG and TRCF families (Figure 2). In RecG, this motif has been shown to couple nucleotide hydrolysis (sensed by the conserved arginine finger of motif VI seen in Figure 3C) to duplex translocation through reorganization of a constellation of hydrogen bonds involving two invariant arginines and a conserved negative charge (D889 in TRCF; Figure 2) preceding motif VI (Mahdi et al., 2003Mahdi A.A. Briggs G.S. Sharples G.J. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. A model for dsDNA translocation revealed by a structural motif common to RecG and Mfd proteins.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A similar picture has emerged in TRCF, where the TRG motif is essential for RNAP-release (Chambers et al., 2003Chambers A.L. Smith A.J. Savery N.J. A DNA translocation motif in the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutations of key residues in this region (highlighted in Figure 3C) lead to functional defects—alanine sustitutions of absolutely conserved R953 or Q963 (Figure 2) completely abolished TRCF-mediated release both in vitro and in vivo, while DNA binding and nucleotide hydrolysis functions remained intact. Similar but less drastic effects were observed for alanine substitutions of R929 and H948, both highly conserved as basic residues (Chambers et al., 2003Chambers A.L. Smith A.J. Savery N.J. A DNA translocation motif in the bacterial transcription-repair coupling factor, Mfd.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6409-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the TRG motif functions as a key link between ATP hydrolysis and conformational changes that result in DNA translocation (Mahdi et al., 2003Mahdi A.A. Briggs G.S. Sharples G.J. Wen Q. Lloyd R.G. A model for dsDNA translocation revealed by a structural motif common to RecG and Mfd proteins.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the ADP bound RecG structure, the TRG motif forms an antiparallel helical hairpin (blue in Figure 3D), positioning highly conserved R704 and R725 (corresponding to TRCF R929 and R953) in an electrostatically unfavorable interaction. In stark contrast, in apo-TRCF, the helical hairpin snaps open. The first helix containing R929 overlays well with the corresponding helix in RecG, but the second helix is displaced outward such that R929 and R953 are separated by about 20 Å (Figure 3C). R929 is hydrogen-bonded to the main chain carbonyl of F891 and conserved D889, while R953 interacts with absolutely conserved D949. In addition, the helix corresponding to helicase motif VI (red in Figure 3C) tilts toward the TRG motif, inserting itself between the two TRG-motif helices and promoting the open conformation of the TRG helices seen in TRCF. The second TRG helix, longer than that found in RecG, continues not with a (partially disordered) loop but with two well-defined α helices comprising the hook. The hook helices make extensive, conserved hydrophobic interactions with the RH. For instance, W550 and V561 of the RH make van der Waal's interactions with I970 and Y975 (respectively) of the hook, and each of these positions is highly conserved as a hydrophobic residue (Figure 2). The RH/hook interaction may play a role in stabilizing the straight RH seen in the TRCF conformation. In this view, the TRG motif serves as a spring-loaded structural element. The closed conformation of the TRG motif seen in RecG may be inherently unstable, in part due to unfavorable electrostatic interactions between R929 and R953. These unfavorable interactions are overcome by the binding energy of ATP, which binds in the crevice between TD1 and TD2 and stabilizes an orientation of TD1/TD2 that requires the closed TRG conformation. Upon ATP hydrolysis and subsequent dissociation, TD1 and TD2 are no longer constrained, and the TRG motif snaps open to its favored conformation (seen in TRCF), which is, in turn, stabilized by the insertion of the helicase motif VI α helix in between the TRG motif helices. Neither the RH, the TRG motif, nor the hook structure participate in any crystal contacts, arguing that the observed conformations are not due to crystallization artifacts. The disposition of the RH, the TRG, and the hook structural elements within the heart of the TRCF enzyme likely controls large-scale domain rearrangements within the molecule, particularly D4 via the bending motion of the RH and D7 via the opening of the TRG hairpin. An N-terminal region of TRCF shows sequence similarity with the UvrB component of the NER machinery (Selby and Sancar, 1993Selby C.P. Sancar A. Molecular mechanism of transcription-repair coupling.Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). For instance, residues 82–219 of E. coli TRCF are 22% identical with residues 114-251 of Bacillus caldotenax UvrB (Figure 2). This region of both proteins is believed to function in binding the NER component UvrA (Selby and Sancar, 1993Selby C.P. Sancar A. Molecular mechanism of transcription-repair coupling.Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, Selby and Sancar, 1995aSelby C.P. Sancar A. Structure and function of transcription-repair coupling factor. I. Structural domains and binding properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An N-terminal truncation of TRCF missing this UvrB homology region, TRCFΔ[1-378], is functional for RNAP binding and release of stalled TECs but appears to be defective in UvrA interaction (Selby and Sancar, 1995aSelby C.P. Sancar A. Structure and function of transcription-repair coupling factor. I. Structural domains and binding properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the structural similarity with UvrB extends over a much larger segment of TRCF than indicated by sequence similarity (Figure 4A). TRCF residues 1–349 are structurally similar to B. caldotenax UvrB (rmsd 3.1 Å; Truglio et al., 2004Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M. DellaVecchia M.J. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Interactions between UvrA and UvrB: the role of UvrB's domain 2 in nucleotide excision repair.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) despite low pair-wise sequence identity of 16% (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 4; Table S1). D1a packs intimately against D1b to form a structural unit with a six-stranded β sheet core to which both domains contribute. In UvrB, structure-function analysis indicated that residues in D1a and D1b are involved in DNA damage recognition and binding. According to the padlock binding model, after UvrA-mediated loading, damaged DNA is recognized by UvrB via a mobile, highly conserved β hairpin that spans the cleft between D1a and D1b (magenta in Figure 4A) (Theis et al., 1999Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Crystal structure of UvrB, a DNA helicase adapted for nucleotide excision repair.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Skorvaga et al., 2002Skorvaga M. Theis K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1553-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TRCF is bereft of this β hairpin (Figure 4A). In contrast to the Uvr(A)BC machinery, TRCF acts as a DNA damage marker via protein/protein interactions with the stalled elongating RNAP, obviating the need for the β hairpin as a DNA damage sensor and anchor. As expected from the sequence similarity mentioned above, D2 superimposes well (rmsd of 1.7 Å) with D2 (residues 154–251) of UvrB (PDB ID 1T5L; (Truglio et al., 2004Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M. DellaVecchia M.J. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Interactions between UvrA and UvrB: the role of UvrB's domain 2 in nucleotide excision repair.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations provide further support for proposals that TRCF acts as a platform for recruiting the NER machinery to DNA lesions by direct interaction with UvrA (Selby and Sancar, 1993Selby C.P. Sancar A. Molecular mechanism of transcription-repair coupling.Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In addition to the obvious sequence and structural homology, there is evidence that TRCF and UvrB utilize a similar mode of binding to UvrA, as TRCF displaces UvrB from the Uvr(AB) complex (Selby and Sancar, 1993Selby C.P. Sancar A. Molecular mechanism of transcription-repair coupling.Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To locate potential UvrA/TRCF interaction sites, sequence conservation between UvrB and TRCF was mapped onto the surface of D2 (Figure 4B). The only invariant residue common to both TRCF and UvrB corresponds to TRCF R181. In B. caldotenax UvrB, this was shown to be part of a larger conserved surface patch harboring residues involved in UvrA binding (Truglio et al., 2004Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M.

ATF3-/- cells, either with or without Ras transformation, had increased Rb phosphorylation and higher levels of various cyclins. Significantly, ATF3 bound to the cyclin D1 promoter as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and repressed its transcription by a transcription assay.

During cancer development, the cells encounter many stress signals, including genotoxic damages, inappropriate activation of oncogenes, telomere erosion, hypoxia, and nutrient deprivation in the tumor microenvironment (for review, see Ref. 1Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar). All along, the cells have built-in mechanisms to restrain or eliminate themselves (for review, see Ref. 2Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22406) Google Scholar). A prominent example is p53, which upon stress induction either arrests or kills cells (for reviews, see Refs. 3Ko L.J. Prives C.

Another example is oncogene-induced killing: oncogenic stress, such as inappropriate activation of the E2F1 and c-Myc oncogenes, triggers apoptosis (for reviews, see Refs. 1Evan G.I. Vousden K.H.

Therefore, the successful cancer cells are those that manage to foil the hardwired stress response to eliminate themselves during the process of transformation from normal cells to cancerous cells. Thus, to understand cancer development, it is important to study the stress response genes that may play an important role in this selfeliminating safeguard process.

Overwhelming evidence indicates that ATF3 is a stress-inducible gene: its mRNA level is low or not detectable in most cells, but is greatly induced by a variety of stress signals, including genotoxic agents such as ultraviolet light (UV), benzo-[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), ionizing radiation, and methyl methanesulfonate (for reviews, see Refs. 6Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar and 7Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In addition, ATF3 is induced by ischemia (8Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and hypoxia 4K. Ameri, C. Culmsee, M. Raida, D. M. Katschinski, R. H. Wenger, T. Hai, E. Wagner, and A. L. Harris, submitted manuscript. , conditions encountered by cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment. Emerging evidence suggests that ATF3 may play a role in cancer development. It has been reported to affect cell death and cell cycle progression, two processes that regulate the growth of cancer cells. However, controversies remain for its roles in these processes. For cell death, ATF3 has been reported to be either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic. Ectopic expression of ATF3 induced apoptosis in ovarian cells (11Syed V. Mukherjee K. Lyons-Weiler J. Lau K.M. Mashima T. Tsuruo T. Ho S.M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1774-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and enhanced the ability of etoposide or camptothecin to induce apoptosis in HeLa cells (12Mashima T. Udagawa S. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting a pro-apoptotic role of ATF3. Consistently, primary islets derived from ATF3 knock-out (ATF3-/-) mice were partially protected from cytokine- and nitric oxide-induced apoptosis (13Hartman M.G. Lu D. Kim M.L. Kociba G.J. Shukri T. Buteau J. Wang X. Frankel W.L. Guttridge D. Prentki M. Grey S.T. Ron D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5721-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antisense ATF3 reduced stress-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells (14Nawa T. Nawa M.T. Adachi M.T. Uchimura I. Shimokawa R. Fujisawa K. Tanaka A. Numano F. Kitajima S. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 161: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, both gain-of-function (ectopic expression) and loss-of-function (knock-out and antisense) approaches support a pro-apoptotic role of ATF3. However, several reports suggest that ATF3 is anti-apoptotic. Adenovirus-mediated expression of ATF3 reduced nerve growth factor (NGF) withdrawal-induced apoptosis in superior cervical ganglion neurons in vitro (15Nakagomi S. Suzuki Y. Namikawa K. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suppressed kainic acid-induced death in hippocampal neurons in vivo (16Francis J.S. Dragunow M. During M.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 124: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and inhibited adriamycin-induced apoptosis in primary cardiomyocytes in vitro (17Nobori K. Ito H. Tamamori-Adachi M. Adachi S. Ono Y. Kawauchi J. Kitajima S. Marumo F. Isobe M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1387-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, the anti-apoptotic role of ATF3 has not been demonstrated by the loss-of-function approach. For cell cycle regulation, some reports suggest that ATF3 promotes cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of ATF3 by transient transfection moderately induced DNA synthesis in hepatic tumor cells (18Allan A.L. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. LaMarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27272-27280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, retrovirus-mediated stable expression of ATF3 promoted the proliferation of chick embryo fibroblasts under low serum concentrations (19Perez S. Vial E. van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, ectopic expression of ATF3 suppressed cell cycle progression in HeLa cells (20Fan F. Jin S. Amundson S.A. Tong T. Fan W. Zhao H. Zhu X. Mazzacurati L. Li X. Petrik K.L. Fornace Jr., A.J. Rajasekaran B. Zhan Q. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7488-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, similar to the situation in cell death, conflicting data exist for the roles of ATF3 in cell cycle regulation. One potential explanation for the above conflicting results is the diverse cell types used in the studies, ranging from primary islets or neurons to hepatic tumor cells. Other explanations include the varying levels and durations of ATF3 expression, and the differences in the approaches used in the studies; some used the gain-of-function approach whereas others used the loss-of-function approach. We sought to study the roles of ATF3 in cell death and cell cycle regulation in the same cell type using fibroblasts. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that ATF3 plays a role in cancer development using the Ras-stimulated transformation of fibroblasts as a model, a well established and widely accepted model for studying tumorigenesis. In this report, we show that ATF3 promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Its action on cell cycle arrest correlated with reduced phosphorylation of Rb and reduced protein levels of various cyclins in ATF3+/+ cells compared with that in ATF3-/- cells. Furthermore, we show that ATF3 suppressed Ras-stimulated tumorigenesis, at least in part, by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell death. Cell Culture, Plasmids, and the JNK-I Inhibitor—ATF3 knock-out mice in the C57BL/6 background were described previously (13Hartman M.G. Lu D. Kim M.L. Kociba G.J. Shukri T. Buteau J. Wang X. Frankel W.L. Guttridge D. Prentki M. Grey S.T. Ron D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5721-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from day 13.5 wild-type C57BL/6 or ATF3 knock-out embryos and immortalized by the 3T9 protocol: passaged at the density of 9 × 105 cells per 6-cm plate every 3 days (21Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar). MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acid, and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Phoenix ecotropic virus packaging cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. pRetro-off-HA-ATF3 was generated by inserting hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human ATF3 open reading frame into the NotI site of pRetro-off vector (Clontech), pRetro-off-HA-ATF4 by inserting the HA-ATF4 open reading frame into the BamHI site of the vector, and pRetro-off-HA-ATF3-(1-100) by inserting the DNA fragment encoding HA-tagged ATF3 amino acids 1-100 into the NotI site. pBabe-puro, pBabe-hygro, and pBabe-puro-H-Ras(V12) were kindly provided by Dr. Gustavo Leone (Ohio State University). pBabe-hygro-ATF3 was generated by inserting the open reading frame of human ATF3 into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pBabe-hygro. JNK-I, a cell-permeable peptide that inhibits the activation of the JNK pathway (22Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), was from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Retrovirus Production and Infection—The Phoenix ecotropic virus packaging cells were transfected with pBabe constructs using the calcium phosphate method; the medium containing the viruses was collected 48 h after transfection and aliquots kept at -80 °C until use. MEFs were infected with high titer retroviruses in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene and selected by adding the appropriate antibiotics (puromycin 2.5 μg/ml or hygromycin 250 μg/ml) at 48 h after infection. In general, more than 50% of the cells survived selection, and by day 4 most of the non-transduced cells had died off. Transformation was judged successful if the cells displayed morphological changes characteristic of Ras transformation (highly refractile with thin and long projections). The resulting pools of transduced cells on day 7 were used in subsequent experiments. All results presented were derived from at least three repeated experiments using independently transduced cells and were reproducible using two batches of immortalized cells derived from different litters of mice. Generation of Tet-off Stable Cells and Apoptosis Assays—Stable cell lines were established by transfecting the wild-type fibroblasts with various pRetro-off constructs followed by puromycin selection. Individual colonies were selected, expanded, and maintained in the presence of tetracycline and puromycin. Each stable cell line was grown in the absence of tetracycline for the indicated times to induce the expression of the transgenes before assays. For trypan blue stain, both the floating and attached cells were collected and stained, and the blue cells scored as dead. For Annexin V stain, the cells were grown on Superfrost Plus slides (VWR Scientific); the unfixed cells were stained with 5% Annexin V-FITC (BD Pharmingen) and 5 μg/μl propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma), and visualized using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. For DAPI stain, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1 μm DAPI. For TUNEL assay, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with hydrogen peroxide before incubated with biotin-dCTP and terminal transferase (Invitrogen). The signals were detected by the ABC complex followed by the DAB substrate solution (Vector). For DNA laddering, both the floating and attached cells were collected and the genomic DNAs extracted for analysis on a 2% agarose gel. Serum Stimulation and BrdU Labeling—Cells at about 50% confluency were serum-starved with 0.1% FBS for 72 h and restimulated with 10% FBS for indicated times before harvesting for immunoblot analysis (below), transcription assay (below), or BrdU labeling (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. UV Treatment and Viability Assay—2 × 105 cells were seeded on 6-cm plates and treated with UV at the dose indicated in the Fig. 1 legend. At various times after UV treatment, cells were either harvested for immunoblot analysis (below) or assayed for viability using crystal violet stain quantified by A595 reading. The A595 reading at 48 and 72 h after UV treatment was standardized against the A595 of the respective cells upon seeding (at 4 h after seeding when the cells became attached) to reduce the artifacts caused by seeding variations. The standardized A595 reading of the wild-type cells at each time point was arbitrarily defined as 1 to obtain the relative cell viability of the knock-out cells. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Cells were incubated with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min to cross-link proteins and DNAs, followed by sonication to shear the DNAs to an average size of 500-1000 bp. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using 2 μg of ATF3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or IgG. After reversal of cross-linking, the DNA fragments were purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, followed by PCR analysis using primers flanking the CRE/ATF site on the cyclin D1 promoter: 5′-CGAGCGATTTGCATATCTACC-3′ (upstream) and 5′-GTAGTCCGTGTGACGTTACTG-3′ (downstream). Transcriptional Assay of Endogenous Cyclin D1 Gene—Nuclear RNAs were isolated from the nuclei of serum-starved and restimulated cells using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I to remove the contaminating genomic DNAs. The cyclin D1 pre-mRNAs were assayed by reverse transcription coupled with polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as detailed previously (8Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using a primer set targeted at the exon 2 and intron 2 of the corresponding gene: 5′-TTGACTGCCGAGAAGTTGTG-3′ (upstream) and 5′-ACAGAGGTAGAATGGGTTGG-3′ (downstream). A control RT-PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was included using the following primers: 5′-CCGGATCCTGGGAAGCTTGTCATCAACGG-3′ (upstream) and 5′-GGCTCGAGGCAGTGATGGCATGGACTG-3′ (downstream). Reactions without reverse transcriptase were included to confirm that the signals were not derived from the genomic DNAs. Cell Growth at Low Concentrations of Serum and Colony Formation in Soft Agar—For cell growth analysis, 1 × 104 cells were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate and grown in the presence of 0.1-2% FBS for 1-7 days as indicated in the Fig. 5 legend. Cells were stained by crystal violet and the A595 readings measured. For anchorage-independent growth, 5 × 104 cells were resuspended in 4 ml of growth medium containing 0.3% agarose and plated on 6-cm plates containing a solidified bottom layer made of 0.6% agarose in medium. After the 0.3% agarose solidified, 3 ml of growth medium were added to the plates and replaced every 3 days. 21 days after plating, colonies were stained with methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium (MTT) and imaged at ×10 magnification. Each experiment was performed with duplicate plates. Xenograft Tumor Formation Assays—2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline and injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the flank or intravenously (i.v.) into the tail vein of 8-10 week-old athymic NCr male mice (Taconic). For s.c. injection, ATF3+/+ and ATF3-/- cells were injected into the right and left flanks of the same mouse to eliminate the differences due to the host. Tumor size was determined at 3-day intervals by measuring the length (L) and width (W) of the tumor using a pair of calipers, and the tumor volume calculated as (L × W2)/2 (23Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). At 21 days after injection, mice were weighed to obtain their body weights and euthanized. Subcutaneous tumors and the lungs were excised and weighed, and the ratio of lung to total body weight was calculated. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Ohio State University. Immunoblot and Immunohistochemistry Analysis—Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and analyzed by immunoblot using polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore) and various primary antibodies: ATF3, Cdk2, Cdk4, cyclin A, cyclin E, Rb, Erk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p-Rb, cleaved caspase 3, cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling), actin (Sigma), and cyclin D1 (Calbiochem). Bound primary antibodies were detected using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling) and Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate (Roche Applied Science). Paraffin-embedded xenograft tumor sections were analyzed for phosphohistone H3 and cleaved caspase 3 by immunohistochemistry as described before (8Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using the antibody against phosphohistone H3 (Upstate Biotechnologies) or cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling). To quantify the phosphohistone H3-positive cells, the positive cells within the entire tumor sections were counted. The tumor area was measured by the Meta Vue program under ×40 magnification, and the positive cells per mm2 were calculated. Statistical Analysis—All numerical values are mean ± S.E. Comparison between two groups was made by two-sample Student's t test, and comparison among three groups by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. ATF3 Is Pro-apoptotic in Immortalized Fibroblasts—We isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type (ATF3+/+) and ATF3 knock-out (ATF3-/-) mice (13Hartman M.G. Lu D. Kim M.L. Kociba G.J. Shukri T. Buteau J. Wang X. Frankel W.L. Guttridge D. Prentki M. Grey S.T. Ron D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5721-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and immortalized them as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” To test whether ATF3 deficiency affects the cells in their response to stress-induced apoptosis, we used the UV-induced apoptosis as a paradigm. Fig. 1, A and B show that UV induced ATF3 in the wild-type fibroblasts but not the knock-out cells. The induction was detected 2 h after treatment, consistent with previous reports that ATF3 is induced by stress signals within 2 h in most stress paradigms (for a review, see Ref. 6Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, ATF3-/- cells were partially protected from UV-induced apoptosis as evidenced by increased cell viability at 48 and 72 h after treatment (Fig. 1C), decreased activation of caspase 3, and decreased cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (Fig. 1D). Fig. 1C shows the averages from three experiments and Fig. 1D is a representative result. Taken together, these results suggest a pro-apoptotic role of ATF3. To confirm this conclusion by a complementary approach, we attempted to express ATF3 ectopically in the wild-type fibroblasts. Although stable cells constitutively expressing ATF3 were reported by others in HeLa cells (12Mashima T. Udagawa S. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), HT1080 cells (24Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10804-10812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and chicken embryo fibroblasts (19Perez S. Vial E. van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we were unable to establish such stable lines using the mouse fibroblasts. Therefore, we used the tet-off system to express ATF3 in an inducible manner. We analyzed three clones and compared them to three control cell lines generated in parallel: (a) ATF3-(1-100) line expressing a mutant ATF3 that lacks the leucine zipper domain and does not bind to DNA (25Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (b) ATF4 line expressing another member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, (c) a vector control line. As shown in Fig. 2A, expression of ATF3 led to reduced cell viability as assayed by trypan blue exclusion test; however, expression of ATF3-(1-100) or ATF4 did not. We then analyzed one ATF3 clone (clone 38) and compared it to the vector control cells. As shown in Fig. 2, B-E, expression of ATF3 led to features characteristic of apoptosis: 1) membrane inversion by Annexin V stain (panel B), 2) pyknotic nuclei by DAPI stain (panel C), DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay (panel D), and DNA laddering (panel E). Therefore, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches demonstrated that ATF3 is pro-apoptotic in mouse fibroblasts. ATF3 Inhibits Serum Stimulation-induced Cell Cycle Progression—To determine whether ATF3 plays a role in cell cycle progression, we serum-starved the ATF3+/+ and ATF3-/- cells for 3 days and simulated them with 10% serum. As shown in Fig. 3A, serum stimulation transiently induced ATF3 expression in the wild-type cells. BrdU labeling indicated that ATF3-/- cells progressed from G1 to S phase more efficiently than the ATF3+/+ cells. At 16 h after serum stimulation, about 60% (62 ± 4%) of the ATF3-/- cells underwent DNA replication, but only about 45% (44 ± 2%) of the ATF3+/+ cells did (Fig. 3B, p < 0.05). The difference between the wild-type and knock-out cells remained at 20 h after serum stimulation (Fig. 3B, p < 0.05). At 9 and 12 h after serum stimulation, some cells had already progressed into S phase in both wild-type and knock-out cells, but there was no difference between them. Fig. 3B shows the average of three experiments and Fig. 3C shows a representative image of BrdU-stained cells at different time points. ATF3 Inhibits Ras-stimulated Cell Growth at Low Serum Concentrations and in Soft Agar—Because cell cycle arrest and cell death are important brakes for cancer cell progression, the above results suggested that ATF3 may function as a tumor suppressor. To test this hypothesis, we used the Ras-stimulated transformation of immortalized MEFs, a well established and widely accepted paradigm for studying transformation. We transduced the immortalized wild-type (ATF3+/+) and knock-out (ATF3-/-) fibroblasts with a retroviral vector expressing oncogenic H-Ras (RasV12) or an empty vector, and selected the transduced cells with appropriate antibiotics. As shown in Fig. 4A, ATF3 expression was induced in the wild-type cells upon Ras(V12) transduction. This is an important result, because ATF3, as an inducible gene, is not expressed (or expressed at a very low level) in untreated wild-type cells. If ATF3 is not induced by oncogenic Ras in the wild-type cells, the deficiency of ATF3 in the knock-out cells may not have any detectable consequences in this paradigm. Oncogenic Ras activates many signaling pathways, including the JNK pathway (for review, see Ref. 26Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Because JNK pathway is involved in the induction of ATF3 by various signals (13Hartman M.G. Lu D. Kim M.L. Kociba G.J. Shukri T. Buteau J. Wang X. Frankel W.L. Guttridge D. Prentki M. Grey S.T. Ron D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5721-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 27Cai Y. Zhang C. Nawa T. Aso T. Tanaka M. Oshiro S. Ichijo H. Kitajima S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2140-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether the JNK pathway is involved in the induction of ATF3 by Ras. Fig. 4B shows that treatment of the Ras-transformed cells with JNK-I, a cell-permeable inhibitor of the JNK pathway (22Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), reduced the expression of ATF3, indicating that the induction of ATF3 by H-Ras(V12) is mediated, at least in part, by the JNK pathway. For the convenience of discussion, we will refer to the Ras-transformed wild-type cells as Ras/ATF3+/+ and the Ras-transformed knock-out cells as Ras/ATF3-/- cells. All results presented below involving the Ras-transformed cells were derived from at least three independent experiments. For each experiment, pools of retrovirustransduced cells (detailed under “Experimental Procedures”) were used for the assays. To rule out the possibility that the differences between Ras/ATF3+/+ and Ras/ATF3-/- cells were caused by the immortalization process rather than the ATF3 deficiency in the knock-out cells, we generated a second batch of immortalized ATF3+/+ and ATF3-/- MEFs and transformed them with H-Ras(V12). Similar results were obtained from the second batch of immortalized cells (data not shown). To examine whether ATF3 deficiency affects Ras-stimulated transformation, we examined the growth of Ras/ATF3+/+ and Ras/ATF3-/- cells at low concentrations of serum. Time course analysis showed that the cell number of Ras/ATF3-/- cells increased faster than that of Ras/ATF3+/+ cells; the difference was detectable starting at day 3 after seeding and continued to day 7 when the plates became confluent and the experiments terminated (Fig. 5A,*, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01). Dose analysis indicated that the increase of cell number over a 4-day period (from day 2 to day 6) was statistically different (p < 0.05) between Ras/ATF3+/+ and Ras/ATF3-/- cells at 1% of serum (Fig. 5B). To test whether the difference was caused by the deficiency of ATF3 in the knock-out cells, we complemented the Ras/ATF3-/- cells with ATF3 by retroviral tran"
https://openalex.org/W2168952228,"We describe a three-protein signal-transduction pathway that governs immunity to a protein toxin involved in cannibalism by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Cells of B. subtilis enter the pathway to sporulate under conditions of nutrient limitation but delay becoming committed to spore formation by killing nonsporulating siblings and feeding on the dead cells. Killing is mediated by the exported toxic protein SdpC. We report that extracellular SdpC induces the synthesis of an immunity protein, SdpI, that protects toxin-producing cells from being killed. SdpI, a polytopic membrane protein, is encoded by a two-gene operon under sporulation control that contains the gene for an autorepressor, SdpR. The autorepressor binds to and blocks the promoter for the operon. Evidence indicates that SdpI is also a signal-transduction protein that responds to the SdpC toxin by sequestering the SdpR autorepressor at the membrane. Sequestration relieves repression and stimulates synthesis of immunity protein."
https://openalex.org/W2046146856,"Cardiac hypertrophy and dilation are mediated by neuroendocrine factors and/or mitogens as well as through internal stretch- and stress-sensitive signaling pathways, which in turn transduce alterations in cardiac gene expression through specific signaling pathways. The transcription factor family known as myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) has been implicated as a signal-responsive mediator of the cardiac transcriptional program. For example, known hypertrophic signaling pathways that utilize calcineurin, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and MAPKs can each affect MEF2 activity. Here we demonstrate that MEF2 transcription factors induced dilated cardiomyopathy and lengthening of myocytes. Specifically, multiple transgenic mouse lines with cardiac-specific overexpression of MEF2A or MEF2C presented with cardiomyopathy at base line or were predisposed to more fulminant disease following pressure overload stimulation. The cardiomyopathic response associated with MEF2A and MEF2C was not further altered by activated calcineurin, suggesting that MEF2 functions independently of calcineurin in this response. In cultured cardiomyocytes, MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2-VP16 overexpression induced sarcomeric disorganization and focal elongation. Mechanistically, MEF2A and MEF2C each programmed similar profiles of altered gene expression in the heart that included extracellular matrix remodeling, ion handling, and metabolic genes. Indeed, adenoviral transfection of cultured cardiomyocytes with MEF2A or of myocytes from the hearts of MEF2A transgenic adult mice showed reduced transient outward K+ currents, consistent with the alterations in gene expression observed in transgenic mice and partially suggesting a proximal mechanism underlying MEF2-dependent cardiomyopathy.

Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). MEF2 DNA binding activity consists of homo- and heterodimers of four separate gene products in mammals, referred to as Mef2a–d (2Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 3Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9366-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). MEF2 dimers bind to the consensus sequence CTA(A/T)4TAG present in the 5′-transcriptional regulatory regions of most skeletal and cardiac muscle structural genes characterized to date (2Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 3Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9366-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In general, Mef2a–d genes are widely expressed in the adult vertebrate organism, although a number of specific regulatory functions have been identified in immune, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and neuronal cells (4Rao S.

Olson E.N. Science. 1997; 276: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). MEF2 factors are related to another MADS box-containing transcription factor known as serum response factor (SRF) (8Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Similar to SRF, members of the MEF2 family have been implicated in regulating inducible gene expression in response to mitogen and/or stress stimulation. In the heart, myocytes undergo developmental and pathophysiological hypertrophy in response to neuroendocrine, mitogen, and stress stimulation. Such stimuli activate intracellular signal transduction cascades, resulting in the modification of transcription factor activity and the reprogramming of cardiac gene expression. A number of lines of evidence suggest that MEF2 factors might regulate inducible gene expression in response to stimuli that underlie the cardiac hypertrophic response. For example, MEF2 DNA binding activity in the heart was shown to be up-regulated 2–3-fold by both pressure and volume overload hypertrophy (9Molkentin J.D. Markham B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19512-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MEF2 DNA binding activity was also shown to be enhanced in myopathic hearts from mdx:myoD–/– mice (10Kolodziejczyk S.M. Wang L. Balazsi K. DeRepentigny Y. Kothary R. Megeney L.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1203-1206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mef2c null mice have altered cardiac gene expression and die during early embryonic development with arrested heart tube morphogenesis, suggesting a critical role in developmental growth (7Lin Q. Schwarz J. Bucana C. Olson E.N. Science. 1997; 276: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant of MEF2C in the heart also die during postnatal development with attenuated ventricular growth (10Kolodziejczyk S.M. Wang L. Balazsi K. DeRepentigny Y. Kothary R. Megeney L.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1203-1206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, a portion of Mef2a null mice die suddenly during the perinatal period with dilated right ventricles, myofibrillar disorganization, and mitochondrial structural abnormalities (11Naya F.J. Black B.L. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Hypertrophic stimulation of the adult heart is associated with activation of a number of intracellular signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), calcineurin, protein kinase C, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, insulin-like growth factor 1 pathway constituents, and altered intracellular Ca2+ handling (12Molkentin J.D. Dorn II, G.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 13Balke C.W. Shorofsky S.R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 290-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the activation of these discrete intracellular signaling pathways, MEF2 factors can be activated by Ca2+ (14Mao Z. Wiedmann M. J. Biol.

Richardson J.A. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). More provocatively, MEF2 factors are also regulated through association with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the nucleus (17Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 29Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In fact, Ca2+ signaling through calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was shown to directly regulate MEF2 transcription factors via a mechanism involving phosphorylation of HDAC4 and HDAC5, resulting in their extrusion from the nucleus, thus permitting MEF2 to activate transcription (17Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 32McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). As an extension of these studies, MEF2 has also been indirectly implicated as a regulator of cardiac hypertrophy through the observation that Hdac9 null mice develop exaggerated hypertrophy and have enhanced MEF2 reporter gene activation in the heart (35Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Finally, MEF2 factors have been implicated in regulating cardiac hypertrophy through the use of a MEF2-dependent β-galactosidase reporter transgene (36Naya F.J. Wu C. Richardson J.A. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 2045-2052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEF2 reporter mice show enhanced β-galactosidase staining in the hypertrophic hearts when classed with calcineurin and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase transgenic mice (28Passier R. Zeng H. Frey N. Naya F.J. Nicol R.L. McKinsey T.A. Overbeek P. Richardson J.A. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 35Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Despite each of the lines of evidence discussed above, the hypothesis that MEF2 transcription factors promote the cardiac hypertrophic response has yet to be directly evaluated in vivo. Here we generated multiple independent lines of transgenic mice that overexpress either MEF2A or MEF2C specifically in the heart. These lines demonstrated a dosage-sensitive induction of dilated cardiomyopathy with a progressive loss of ventricular performance. Moreover, surgical induction of pressure overload hypertrophy produced more fulminant disease in MEF2 transgenic mice. However, crossing MEF2A or MEF2C transgenic mice with transgenic mice expressing activated calcineurin did not enhance hypertrophy, suggesting that MEF2 might function independently of calcineurin-directed hypertrophy in the adult heart. In-depth assessment of altered gene expression in the hearts of both MEF2A and MEF2C transgenic mice using Affymetrix™ arrays suggested a number of mechanistic associations with the cardiomyopathic disease response mediated through MEF2. Animal Models and Procedures—Cardiac-specific MEF2A and MEF2C transgenic mice were generated by fusing the full-length human MEF2A or mouse MEF2C cDNA to the murine α-myosin heavy chain promoter (37Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), followed by injection of the DNA into newly fertilized mouse embryos (FVB/N background). Pathological hypertrophy was induced by constriction of the transverse aortic arch, a procedure referred to as transverse aortic constriction (TAC). The aorta was visualized through a median sternotomy, and a 7-0 silk ligature was tied around it and a 27-gauge wire between the right brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries, after which the wire was removed to generate a defined constriction (38Wilkins B.J. Dai Y.-S. Bueno O.F. Parsons S.A. Xu J. Plank D.M. Jones F. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Cardiac-specific transgenic mice expressing the activated calcineurin cDNA (ΔCnA) were described previously (39Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1999; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). For echocardiography, mice were anesthetized with 2% Isoflurane, and hearts were visualized using a Hewlett-Packard Sonos 5500 instrument and a 15-MHz transducer. Cardiac ventricular dimensions were measured on M-mode three times for the number of animals indicated. Histological Analysis—Histological analysis of hypertrophy and fibrosis was performed in hearts fixed overnight in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and processed into paraffin blocks for sectioning. Serial 5-μm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin/eosin, Masson trichrome, or wheat germ agglutinin-TRITC conjugate (50 μg/ml) to visualize cell membranes for measuring myocyte cross-sectional areas; at least 100 cells/heart from four independent mice were measured. Dot Blotting and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Dot blotting and RT-PCR to quantify mRNA levels were performed as described previously (40De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Primers employed in the RT-PCR analyses are listed in supplemental Table 1. Western Blotting and Immunocytochemistry—Western blotting and immunocytochemistry were performed as described previously (40De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol.

The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-MEF2C polyclonal antibody (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-MEF2A polyclonal antibody (1:1000) and anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibody (1:5000; Research Diagnostics, Inc.), anti-α-actinin (1:300) and anti-myosin (1:250) monoclonal antibodies (Sigma), anti-focal adhesion kinase (1:400) and anti-phospho-Tyr397 focal adhesion kinase (1:400) antibodies (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.). Cardiomyocyte Cultures and Recombinant Adenovirus—All in vitro experiments were performed in neonatal ventricular myocytes isolated from 1–2-day-old rats as described previously (40De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding MEF2A (human), MEF2B (mouse), MEF2C (mouse), MEF2D (mouse), MEF2C (amino acids 1–143) fused to the VP16 transcriptional activation domain (MEF2-VP16), and the dominant-negative MEF2C(R3T) mutant were used to generate recombinant adenovirus. These cDNAs were subcloned into the pShuttle vector for the Adeno-X system (Clontech) to generate replication-deficient adenoviruses. A MEF2-containing adenovirus (Ad), Ad-β-galactosidase (control), or Ad-green fluorescent protein (GFP; control) was used to infect cultured cardiomyocytes at an approximate multiplicity of infection of 50 for a period of 2 h, followed by analysis 24, 36, or 48 h afterward (40De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, >98% of the cells showed expression of the viral gene insert. Assessment of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocyte cell-surface area (hypertrophy) was performed as described previously (from at least 200 cells in three separate experiments each) (42Taigen T. De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Affymetrix Gene Expression Profiling and Bioinformatics—Total RNA samples were prepared from individual high expressing MEF2A transgenic hearts at 2 weeks of age and compared with two wild-type hearts at 2 weeks of age. Alternatively, a separate array was performed on cardiac RNA collected from line 2 MEF2C transgenic mice and wild-type controls at 4 weeks of age. Biotin-labeled target cRNA was prepared from T7-transcribed cDNA made from 10 μg of the total RNA using the recommended Affymetrix protocol (43Cho R.J. Huang M. Campbell M.J. Dong H. Steinmetz L.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3124-3130PubMed Google Scholar) and hybridized for expression analysis to the Affymetrix GeneChip U74Av2 set using antibody-based fluorescence signal amplification. GeneChips were scanned in the Affymetrix 425S scanner using Affymetrix Microarray Suite Version 5.0. Intensity data were scaled to a target of 1500, and the results were analyzed using both Microarray Suite Version 5.0 and GeneSpring Version 5.0.3 (Silicon Genetics, Inc., Redwood City, CA). Data values used for filtering and clustering were “Signal,” “Signal Confidence,” “Absolute Call” (Absent/Present), and “Change” (Increase, Decrease, Unchanged) as implemented in Microarray Suite 5.0. Data were normalized as follows. The 50th percentile of all measurements was used as a positive control for each array. Measurements for each gene were divided by this synthetic positive control, assuming that this was at least 10. The bottom 10th percentile signal level was used as a test for correct background subtraction. The measurement for each gene in each sample was divided by the average of the corresponding value in the two wild-type samples, assuming that the value was at least 1.0. Genes regulated consistently between the replicates were identified by data filtering using Student's t test (p < 0.01) among genes that were called “Present” in the MEF2 transgenic samples. Gene category information was based on all publicly available gene ontology information from the Gene Ontology Consortium (available http://www.geneontology.org/) as harvested from Swiss-Prot, GeneCards, Compugen, LocusLink, and GenBank™ as well as exhaustive MEDLINE literature searches. Electrophysiological Recordings in Neonatal Cardiomyocytes—Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (45Wickenden A.D. Kaprielian R. Parker T.G. Jones O.T. Backx P.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 271-286Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For patch-clamp recording experiments, 1.5 × 105 myocytes were plated on laminin-coated coverslips in 35-mm culture dishes. After 24 h in culture, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and viral infections were performed (multiplicity of infection of 10 for AdGFP and AdMEF2A). Typically, >95% of the myocytes showed AdGFP expression 36 h after infection. Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings were done as described previously (45Wickenden A.D. Kaprielian R. Parker T.G. Jones O.T. Backx P.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 271-286Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 46Zobel C. Kassiri Z. Nguyen T.T. Meng Y. Backx P.H. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2385-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) at room temperature to measure transient outward (Ito) and inward rectifier (IK1) K+ currents, at least 36 h after serum withdrawal and infection with AdMEF2A. Myocytes were perfused for at least 15 min before measurements were performed with a solution containing 140 mmol/liter NaCl, 4 mmol/liter KCl, 2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/liter CdCl2, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 10 mmol/liter glucose (pH 7.4). The intracellular solution contained 140 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter EGTA, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 5 mmol/liter MgATP (pH 7.25). Whole cell currents were filtered at 2 kHz (Axon 200A amplifier). Electrophysiological Recordings in Cardiomyocytes from Adult Mouse Whole Hearts—Single ventricular myocytes were obtained from both ventricles of adult mice (3 months old) of both sexes. The cell isolation technique used in these experiments has been described previously (47Petrashevskaya N.N. Bodi I. Rubio M. Molkentin J.D. Schwartz A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 54: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All current recordings were obtained in the whole cell voltage-clamp configuration of the patch-clamp technique by using 1.60 outer diameter borosilicate glass electrodes (Garner Glass Co.). Cell capacitance was measured using voltage ramps of 1 V/s from a holding potential of 0 mV. Series resistance was within the range of 2–11 megaohms. Most of the data presented in these studies were obtained with electrodes with a resistance of 0.5–3 megaohms. Whole cell Ca2+-independent transient outward K+ currents were evoked by a series of depolarizing voltage steps (680 ms) from –40 to +80 mV in 10-mV increments from a holding potential of –40 mV at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. Ventricular cardiomyocytes were perfused with normal Tyrode's solution containing 138 mmol/liter NaCl, 4 mmol/liter KCl, 2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter glucose, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 0.33 mmol/liter NaH2PO4 (adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). ICa was largely eliminated by 0.3 mm CdCl2 included in the recording solution. The pipette solution contained 120 mmol/liter potassium glutamate, 10 mmol/liter KCl, 2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 5 mmol/liter EGTA, and 2 mmol/liter MgATP (adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH). Cell capacitance was estimated by integrating the area under an uncompensated capacity transient elicited by a 25-mV hyperpolarizing test pulse (25 ms) from a holding potential of 0 mV. Ito was defined as the difference between the peak transient current and the steady-state current at the end of a 500-ms voltage-clamp pulse. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °C). Whole cell currents were analyzed with Clampfit Version 6.03 software (Axon Instruments). Pooled data are expressed as means ± S.E. All current amplitudes were normalized to the cell capacitance and expressed as densities (picoamperes/picofarad). Measurement of Adult Cardiomyocyte Length and Width—Wild-type and MEF2A transgenic adult mouse hearts (2 months old) were dissected, washed in ice-cold cannulation buffer (10 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime and 25 μm CaCl2 in minimal essential medium), and perfused with digestion medium (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 90 units/ml collagenase, 10 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime, and 25 μm CaCl2 in minimal essential medium) until the myocardia began to visually dissolve. Perfused hearts were flushed with digestion medium, dissociated, and filtered through a 200-μm mesh into minimal essential medium containing 10 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime and 10 μm CaCl2. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation. Isolated cardiomyocytes were photographed, and the length and width of ∼200 cells from each mouse were measured using NIH Image software, and the length/width ratios were calculated.

Characterization of MEF2A and MEF2C Transgenic Mice—Although a number of reports have suggested a role for MEF2 in regulating the hypertrophic growth of the adult myocardium, it has yet to be formally evaluated. To directly investigate the ability of MEF2 to induce the cardiac hypertrophic response, we generated a series of cardiac-specific transgenic mice using the α-myosin heavy chain promoter. cDNAs encoding MEF2A and MEF2C were selected for overexpression because they have been proposed to be the predominant MEF2 isoforms expressed in the postnatal mouse heart (10Kolodziejczyk S.M.

Three individual MEF2A lines were initially generated and characterized by 1.9-, 3.5-, and 4.2-fold more MEF2A protein expression in the heart when normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fig. 1A). Overexpression of MEF2A resulted in three different migrating species of MEF2A that collapsed upon calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase treatment, suggesting different phosphorylation isoforms (data not shown).

We show here that the ClpXP protease, responsible for the degradation of multiple bacterial proteins, is dynamically localized to specific cellular positions in Caulobacter where it degrades colocalized proteins. The CtrA cell cycle master regulator, that must be cleared from the Caulobacter cell to allow the initiation of chromosome replication, interacts with the ClpXP protease at the cell pole where it is degraded. We have identified a novel, conserved protein, RcdA, that forms a complex with CtrA and ClpX in the cell. RcdA is required for CtrA polar localization and degradation by ClpXP. The localization pattern of RcdA is coincident with and dependent upon ClpX localization. Thus, a dynamically localized ClpXP proteolysis complex in concert with a cytoplasmic factor provides temporal and spatial specificity to protein degradation during a bacterial cell cycle.

In each of these cases, a critical regulatory factor or determinant undergoes controlled, specific proteolysis in response to environmental or intracellular signals. Targeted proteolysis in bacteria employs multisubstrate proteases such as ClpXP, ClpAP, and HslUV, with functional and structural similarity to the 26S proteasome (Gottesman, 2003Gottesman S. Proteolysis in bacterial regulatory circuits.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 565-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These proteases are multisubunit complexes with a guarded active site into which entry is controlled by a separate ATPase domain. The ATPase component is responsible for substrate selection and supplies the energy for unfolding and translocating the substrate into the proteolytic chamber. In the few well-characterized cases of regulated proteolysis in bacteria, factors have been identified that enhance or are necessary for the targeted degradation of proteins by a multisubstrate ATP-dependent protease (Ades, 2004Ades S.E.

Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Caulobacter's cell cycle (Figure 4A) includes an asymmetric cell division that results in progeny of different cell types—a swarmer cell and a stalked cell. The swarmer cell, which is equivalent to the G1 phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle, contains a single quiescent chromosome and can be morphologically distinguished from other cell stages by its smaller size, single polar flagellum, multiple polar pili, and absence of the stalk. Initiation of S phase, that is concurrent with the morphological transformation of a swarmer cell to stalked cell, results in a single round of DNA replication. Subsequent cell division results in two cells of distinct fates—a stalked cell immediately able to initiate DNA replication and a replication-quiescent swarmer cell. Differential activity of the essential cell cycle master regulator CtrA is critical to control of the G1-S transition. CtrA is a DNA binding response regulator whose activity is controlled by phosphorylation on aspartate 51 (D51) in its receiver domain. Caulobacter cell cycle progression requires cyclical presence of activated CtrA (Domian et al., 1997Domian I.J. Quon K.C. Shapiro L.

CtrA directly controls the transcription of almost 100 genes, and it also prevents replication initiation in swarmer cells by binding to five sites in the origin of replication (Laub et al., 2002Laub M.T. Chen S.L. Shapiro L. McAdams H.H. Genes directly controlled by CtrA, a master regulator of the Caulobacter cell cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 1998; 95: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). DNA replication can only begin when CtrA activity is eliminated from the cell (Domian et al., 1997Domian I.J. Quon K.C. Shapiro L. Cell type-specific phosphorylation and proteolysis of a transcriptional regulator controls the G1-to-S transition in a bacterial cell cycle.Cell. 1997; 90: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Activated CtrA is removed from the cell by the redundant mechanisms of temporally controlled dephosphorylation and proteolysis. Only if both of these CtrA control mechanisms are blocked do cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with a single chromosome (Domian et al., 1997Domian I.J. Quon K.C. Shapiro L. Cell type-specific phosphorylation and proteolysis of a transcriptional regulator controls the G1-to-S transition in a bacterial cell cycle.Cell. 1997; 90: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although the ClpXP protease has been shown to mediate CtrA proteolysis (Jenal and Fuchs, 1998Jenal U. Fuchs T. An essential protease involved in bacterial cell-cycle control.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5658-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), the mechanisms ensuring that degradation occurs only at the correct place and time in the cell cycle have not been previously identified. Because both ClpX and ClpP are present throughout the cell cycle, additional factors are expected to direct the proteolysis of CtrA. CtrA proteolysis must be turned off later in the cell cycle to allow for CtrA accumulation, as active CtrA is essential at later times in the cell cycle to prevent additional rounds of DNA replication and for transcriptional activation of many cell functions. One clue to the mechanism controlling CtrA degradation is that CtrA appears at the incipient stalked pole at the time of its degradation, and this polar localization is linked to CtrA proteolysis (Ryan et al., 2002Ryan K.R. Judd E.M. Shapiro L. The CtrA response regulator essential for Caulobacter crescentus cell-cycle progression requires a bipartite degradation signal for temporally controlled proteolysis.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Ryan et al., 2004Ryan K.R. Huntwork S. Shapiro L. Recruitment of a cytoplasmic response regulator to the cell pole is linked to its cell cycle-regulated proteolysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 7415-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the ClpX and ClpP subunits of the ClpXP protease dynamically localize to the incipient stalked cell pole coincident with CtrA polar localization and present biochemical evidence that CtrA interacts with ClpX in the cell, showing that CtrA degradation occurs specifically at the cell pole. In addition, we report the identification of a new cell cycle-regulated protein, conserved among the α-proteobacteria, that localizes in an identical manner to ClpX and ClpP and is required for the specific degradation and polar localization of CtrA. This regulator of CtrA degradation (RcdA) protein forms a complex with both CtrA and ClpX in the cell. Thus, the dynamic polar positioning of the ClpXP protease together with the cytoplasmic RcdA protein mediates CtrA proteolysis at the appropriate time in the cell cycle. A candidate gene that contributes to the degradation of CtrA at a specific time in the cell cycle was identified in the course of seeking additional CtrA-regulatory genes. We approached this by mining previously published genomic data sets. Seven cell cycle-regulated proteins—the DivJ, PleC, and CckA histidine kinases, the response regulators DivK and CtrA, the DNA methyltransferase CcrM, and the GcrA global regulator that oscillates out of phase with CtrA during the cell cycle—regulate at least one of the four redundant mechanisms that control CtrA activity (Domian et al., 1999Domian I.J.

USA. 2004; 101: 7415-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transcription of four of these seven genes, ctrA, gcrA, ccrM, and divK, is also directly regulated by CtrA. CtrA directly regulates the transcription of only 3% of the entire genome, and therefore CtrA-regulated genes are overrepresented (3% versus 57%) among the set of genes that regulate CtrA activity. Thus, direct regulation by CtrA is a possible indicator to identify additional genes that regulate CtrA activity. Further, these seven genes are all highly conserved in nine α-proteobacteria (listed in Experimental Procedures). Thus, to find candidate factors involved in the regulation of CtrA activity, we identified proteins that are (1) directly regulated by CtrA and (2) highly conserved among the nine α-proteobacteria mentioned above (see Table S2 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online for the list of bacterial genome sequences used in this analysis). The seventeen genes encoding proteins that fit these two criteria are shown in Figure 1. Two of these genes, CC1035 and CC3295, encoded proteins of unknown function and were investigated further. Deletion of CC1035 did not yield an identifiable phenotype. However, CC3295, now named rcdA (for regulator of CtrA degradation), proved to be involved in CtrA proteolysis as described below. The genomic neighbors of rcdA (CC3295) are shown in Figure 2A. CC3294, encoding a conserved protein of unknown function, ends 182 bp upstream of the predicted rcdA start codon. The nearest downstream gene, CC3296, encoding another conserved protein of unknown function, is 11 bases downstream of rcdA but on the opposite strand. This genomic organization suggests that rcdA is transcribed as a single gene. We constructed an rcdA deletion/insertion mutation (ΔrcdA::hyg) by replacing all but the first and last 36 bp of the rcdA coding region with a hygromycin-resistance cassette (Blondelet-Rouault et al., 1997Blondelet-Rouault M.H. Weiser J. Lebrihi A. Branny P. Pernodet J.L. Antibiotic resistance gene cassettes derived from the omega interposon for use in E. coli and Streptomyces.Gene. 1997; 190: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The growth rate (data not shown) and morphology of a strain (LS4185) harboring the mutation were similar to that of the wild-type with the exception that stalks were about twice as long as wild-type stalks. The rcdA mutant cells were sensitive to phages ΦCbK and ΦCr30, indicating the presence of pili and an S layer (Edwards and Smit, 1991Edwards P. Smit J. A transducing bacteriophage for Caulobacter crescentus uses the paracrystalline surface layer protein as a receptor.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5568-5572PubMed Google Scholar, Skerker and Shapiro, 2000Skerker J.M. Shapiro L. Identification and cell cycle control of a novel pilus system in Caulobacter crescentus.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3223-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cells of the rcdA mutant did not form diffuse colonies on swarm agar; however, they were observed to be motile under the microscope. In a laboratory strain of Caulobacter crescentus, NA1000 (Evinger and Agabian, 1977Evinger M. Agabian N. Envelope-associated nucleoid from Caulobacter crescentus stalked and swarmer cells.J. Bacteriol. 1977; 132: 294-301PubMed Google Scholar), swarmer cells have a higher density than stalked and predivisional cells and can be separated in a density gradient. Density gradient centrifugation of rcdA mutant cells yielded only 20% as many high-density swarmer cells compared to NA1000 cultures, suggesting a low-density swarmer phenotype. Longer stalks, failure to form swarm colonies, and low-density swarmer phenotypes have all been observed previously in strains with mutations in cell cycle regulatory genes. A polyclonal antibody raised against RcdA(His)6 was used to assay RcdA levels as a function of the cell cycle. Immunoblots of lysates from wild-type and rcdA mutant (LS4185) cells showed that the RcdA(His)6 antibody recognized a single protein in wild-type cells that was not present in the rcdA mutant strain (Figure 2B) and that migrated in SDS-PAGE at the predicted size of RcdA. Therefore, we conclude that the antibody recognizes the native RcdA protein. We isolated swarmer cells (Evinger and Agabian, 1977Evinger M. Agabian N. Envelope-associated nucleoid from Caulobacter crescentus stalked and swarmer cells.J. Bacteriol. 1977; 132: 294-301PubMed Google Scholar) and allowed them to proceed synchronously through the cell cycle, collecting samples every 20 min. We analyzed cell lysates by SDS-PAGE and probed the immunoblots with antibodies against RcdA and CtrA (Figure 2C). RcdA and CtrA levels were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) and graphed as a function of the cell cycle. CtrA levels varied normally over the cell cycle and served as a control for the synchrony (Domian et al., 1997Domian I.J. Quon K.C. Shapiro L. Cell type-specific phosphorylation and proteolysis of a transcriptional regulator controls the G1-to-S transition in a bacterial cell cycle.Cell. 1997; 90: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Levels of RcdA were low in newly isolated swarmer cells and peaked at the onset of the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition, coincident with the proteolysis of CtrA. CtrA is degraded in stalked cells at the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition and in the nascent stalked cell compartment of the late predivisional cell (see Figure 4A). To determine if RcdA affects the regulated proteolysis of CtrA, we performed immunoblots with anti-CtrA antibodies on samples taken from synchronized populations of wild-type and rcdA mutant cells at 20 min intervals over the course of the cell cycle (Figure 3A). The wild-type strain exhibited normal loss of CtrA during the G1-S transition. In the rcdA mutant strain, however, the levels of CtrA remained nearly constant throughout the cell cycle, suggesting that RcdA is required for the temporally regulated degradation of CtrA. To verify that the constant levels of CtrA observed in the rcdA mutant strain were not due to asynchronous growth, we probed the same Western blots with antibody against the McpA chemoreceptor which is also normally degraded at the G1-S transition (Alley et al., 1993Alley M.R. Maddock J.R. Shapiro L. Requirement of the carboxyl terminus of a bacterial chemoreceptor for its targeted proteolysis.Science. 1993; 259: 1754-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast to CtrA levels, McpA levels in the rcdA mutant strain were indistinguishable from wild-type, indicating that RcdA is not required for temporal control of McpA degradation (Figure 3A). This result confirms that the rcdA mutant strain proceeded through the synchrony in a similar manner to wild-type cells and also has important implications for the function of RcdA. McpA proteolysis is similar to CtrA proteolysis in three respects: (1) McpA is degraded at the G1-S transition (Alley et al., 1993Alley M.R. Maddock J.R. Shapiro L. Requirement of the carboxyl terminus of a bacterial chemoreceptor for its targeted proteolysis.Science. 1993; 259: 1754-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); (2) McpA is degraded by the ClpXP protease (Potocka et al., 2002Potocka I. Thein M. Østerås M. Jenal U. Alley M.R. Degradation of a Caulobacter soluble cytoplasmic chemoreceptor is ClpX dependent.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6635-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); and (3) the essential response regulator DivK is required for the temporally controlled degradation of both McpA and CtrA (Hung and Shapiro, 2002Hung D.Y. Shapiro L. A signal transduction protein cues proteolytic events critical to Caulobacter cell cycle progression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 13160-13165Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The normal degradation of McpA observed in rcdA mutant cells precludes a general effect of RcdA on either DivK or ClpXP functions. To confirm that proteolysis of CtrA was affected by the absence of RcdA, pulse-chase experiments were performed to compare the half-life of CtrA conditionally expressed in wild-type and rcdA mutant cells (Figure 3B). The results show that the half-life of CtrA in cells lacking RcdA is significantly longer than its half-life in wild-type cells. Two redundant mechanisms are used by Caulobacter cells to eliminate activated CtrA from the cell so that the G1-S transition can proceed. Regulated proteolysis is one mechanism; the second is regulation of the CtrA phosphorylation state. Mutant Caulobacter strains with stable CtrA remain viable owing to regulation of CtrA phosphorylation (Domian et al., 1997Domian I.J. Quon K.C. Shapiro L. Cell type-specific phosphorylation and proteolysis of a transcriptional regulator controls the G1-to-S transition in a bacterial cell cycle.Cell. 1997; 90: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Consequently, since RcdA is necessary for the regulated proteolysis of CtrA, we predicted that the regulated phosphorylation of CtrA would be essential to the G1-S transition in the rcdA mutant strain. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a strain that both lacks RcdA and contains a CtrA variant that cannot be regulated by dephosphorylation (Figure 3C). This variant of CtrA, CtrAD51E, contains an aspartate-to-glutamate mutation that mimics the function of the phosphorylated aspartate in wild-type CtrA. In a wild-type background, CtrAD51E activity is only regulated by proteolysis; therefore, if RcdA mediates the degradation of CtrAD51E, active CtrA should be maintained at all times in the rcdA mutant strain, generating a G1 cell cycle arrest (Figure 3C). We conditionally expressed ctrAD51E for 8 hr in rcdA mutant and wild-type cells (Figure 3D). Consistent with previous reports, CtrAD51E had no effect on morphology or the G1-S transition when expressed in wild-type cells. However, when ctrAD51E was expressed in the rcdA mutant strain, most cells were elongated and contained only one chromosome by FACS analysis, indicating that the CtrAD51E protein remains active in the absence of RcdA and blocks the cell cycle in G1. Conditional expression of just the wild-type CtrA protein in rcdA mutant had no observable effect on cell morphology or chromosome content, confirming that the G1 arrest results from the loss of regulation of both the phosphorylation state and CtrA proteolysis. This result is identical to the effect of ctrAD51EΔ3Ω allele on wild-type cells (Figure 3D): CtrAD51EΔ3Ω is identical to CtrAD51E, except it contains an additional mutation that blocks CtrA proteolysis (Domian et al., 1997Domian I.J. Quon K.C. Shapiro L. Cell type-specific phosphorylation and proteolysis of a transcriptional regulator controls the G1-to-S transition in a bacterial cell cycle.Cell. 1997; 90: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Therefore, the loss of RcdA phenocopies a mutation in CtrA that prevents its proteolysis. Considering all these observations, we conclude that RcdA is required for the temporally regulated proteolysis of CtrA. To determine the cellular position of RcdA, we integrated a plasmid into the rcdA chromosomal locus that encodes a translational fusion of egfp to the last 300 bp (out of ∼500 bp encoding rcdA) of rcdA. This resulting strain contains a chromosomally encoded full-length version of rcdA fused to egfp under the control of the rcdA promoter, followed by the vector backbone and the last 300 bp of the rcdA gene. Immunoblots against lysates from this strain using anti-RcdA antibody revealed the presence of a single band running at the predicted size of the RcdA-GFP fusion protein. CtrA is degraded normally in this strain, indicating that the RcdA-GFP fusion protein is functional (data not shown). Using this strain, we followed the subcellular localization of RcdA by observing a synchronized population during the cell cycle with time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4B). RcdA-GFP moved first to the incipient stalked pole during the G1-S transition and to the stalked pole in late predivisional cells, coincident with the observed localization of CtrA. RcdA-GFP also transiently localized to the division plane of late predivisional cells in about 25% of the cells. Localization of RcdA-GFP to the division plane generally preceded its localization to the stalked pole, although simultaneous localization to the midcell and stalked pole was observed in about 5% of the cells. The ClpXP protease, which is present throughout the cell cycle, is responsible for the degradation of CtrA at the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition and in the nascent stalked cell compartment of the late predivisional cell (Jenal and Fuchs, 1998Jenal U. Fuchs T. An essential protease involved in bacterial cell-cycle control.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5658-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We previously showed that YFP-tagged CtrA appears as a point focus at the incipient stalked pole coincident with its proteolysis (Ryan et al., 2002Ryan K.R. Judd E.M. Shapiro L. The CtrA response regulator essential for Caulobacter crescentus cell-cycle progression requires a bipartite degradation signal for temporally controlled proteolysis.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar; Figure 4A), and here we show that the RcdA protein is localized at the same time and place as CtrA. To determine if the ClpXP protease colocalizes with CtrA and RcdA at the cell pole, we examined the cellular position of both components of the ClpXP protease, ClpX and ClpP, as a function of the cell cycle (Figures 4C and 4D). To observe the dynamic intracellular position of the ClpXP protease, we created merodiploid strains with either clpX-egfp or clpP-egfp expressed from an inducible chromosomal locus. We integrated a construct encoding a translational fusion of the C terminus of clpX or clpP to egfp into the chromosomal xylX locus of wild-type cells. These strains were grown in minimal (ClpX-GFP) or PYE (ClpP-GFP) media. After induction with xylose for one hour, we performed time-lapse microscopy on synchronized cells to determine the subcellular location of ClpX-GFP or ClpP-GFP at different points during the cell cycle (Figures 4C and 4D). We found that the subcellular localization of ClpX-GFP and ClpP-GFP is identical. Both appeared as a single focus at the incipient stalked cell pole, coincident with the time of CtrA polar localization at both the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition and also in the nascent stalked cell compartment of the late predivisional cell. ClpX-GFP and ClpP-GFP also transiently localized to the cell division plane in late predivisional cells just before their localization to the stalked pole of the predivisional cell."

Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for regulating p53 and suggest that suppressing p53 function is an important component in the proproliferative role of ERα. As a tumor suppressor, p53 plays a central role in cellular processes such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, and differentiation (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar, 2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5799) Google Scholar). Although these functions of p53 are essential to prevent cells from becoming cancerous, left uncontrolled, they can lead to consequences deleterious to normal cells. Mutations in the p53 gene or aberrations in the mechanisms to balance p53 function pave the way to tumorigenesis (3Oren M. Damalas A. Gottlieb T. Michael D. Taplick J. Leal J.F. Maya R. Moas M.

ERα is a transcriptional regulator that is recruited to the promoter regions of target genes directly through binding to estrogen response elements (EREs) or indirectly through other DNA-binding factors, such as AP1 and Sp1 (7Osborne C.K.

The opposing functions of p53 and ERα, while stringently controlled in normal cells, are likely disrupted in cancer cells. Various observations have alluded to the potential for a cross-talk between p53 and ERα signaling pathways. For example, in murine models, early exposure to 17β-estradiol (E2) and progesterone to mimic pregnancy induced nuclear p53 enabling resistance to carcinogenesis by blocking proliferation of apparently ERα-positive cells (10Sivaraman L. Conneely O.M. Medina D. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12379-12384Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In breast cancer cells, increased expression of ERα led to elevated levels of p53 and MDM2, an inhibitor of p53 function (11Liu G. Schwartz J.A. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1810-1814PubMed Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of MDM2 enhanced the function of ERα (12Saji S. Okumura N. Eguchi H. Nakashima S. Suzuki A. Toi M. Nozawa Y. Hayashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, whether there is a direct link between the p53 and ERα pathways has remained unclear. To address this important issue, we investigated whether ERα directly interacts with p53 and affects its function. Cell Culture and Irradiation—MCF7 cells and Saos2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) or 10% dextran-charcoal-treated FBS at 37 °C under 5% CO2. MCF7 cells were irradiated at a dose of 12 grays in a γ-cell 40, S/N 20 irradiator. Control cells were mock-irradiated. Plasmids—The –1265 PCNA-luc reporter plasmid was described previously (13Karuppayil S.M. Moran E. Das G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17303-17306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). pRc/CMV hp53, plasmids expressing wild type and mutant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p53 proteins, and –2326 p21-luc were kindly provided by A. J. Levine, T. Shenk, and W. El-Deiry, respectively. The pCR3.1-based hERα expression plasmids (ER, ER 179C, ER C201H/C206H, ER L539A) and pRST7N282G were from C. Smith. pCR3.1-ER Δ283–595 was constructed by transferring the BamHI-HindIII fragment from pRST7N282G to pCR3.1 linearized with BamHI and HindIII. Transient Transfection and Inhibition of Endogenous ERα and p53 Expression by siRNA—Saos2 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dextran-charcoal-treated FBS were transfected with –1265 PCNA-luc, p53, and wild type and mutant ERα expression plasmids or empty vector using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). After 24 h, cells were processed for measuring transcriptional activity by luciferase assay (Promega). For knock down experiments, ERα, p53, and nonspecific (NS) siRNA (Dharmacon) were transfected into MCF7 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To ascertain the specificity of siRNAs used, the mRNA and the protein levels as well as effects on functional targets of the targeted protein were monitored. Quantitative Real-time (qRT) PCR—Total RNA from MCF7 cells was isolated using the “Absolutely RNA Miniprep Kit” (Stratagene). For analyzing transcription of p21, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in 20 μl of reaction using the “SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System” (Invitrogen). One μl of the resulting cDNA was used in a total volume of 25 μl of PCR reaction. Real-time PCR was carried out in an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System using TaqMan PCR master mixture, probes, and primers (Applied Biosystems). The relative mRNA levels in MCF7 cells transfected with specific versus NS siRNA were calculated using the ΔΔCt method with the endogenous β-actin mRNA as control. Immunoprecipitation—MCF-7 cells irradiated or mock-irradiated were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in NENT buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 1× Halt protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce). The extracts were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C and 2.5 mg of each lysate was precleared with agarose-conjugated mouse IgG (2 h, 4 °C) and subsequently incubated with agarose-conjugated mouse IgG or mouse monoclonal p53 antibody (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Agarose beads with immunoprecipitated proteins were washed four times with NENT buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies for Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (14Nayak B.K. Das G.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7226-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with minor modification with the following antibodies: p53 (DO-1), and ERα (HC-20 and D-12), from (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and β-actin (A2066) from Sigma. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed on MCF7 and Saos2 cells using the ChIP kit (Upstate Biotechnology) as per the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. In the case of Saos2 cells, 24 h prior to cross-linking, cells were transfected with p53 and ERα expression plasmids either individually or in combination. DNA-p53-ERα complexes were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against p53 (DO-1) or ERα (HC-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA after decross-linking, and purification was subjected to PCR with AccuPrime TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR products resolved on 2% agarose gels were visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. GST Pull-down Assay—BL21(DE3) pLySs bacteria expressing GST or wild type and mutant p53 proteins fused to GST were lysed in NENT buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were sonicated, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro translated, [35S]Methionine-labeled (TNT Kit, Promega) wild type or mutant ERα was incubated with immobilized GST or GST fused to wild type or mutant p53 proteins in lysis buffer containing 0.5% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed four times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Cell Cycle Analysis—MCF7 cells were harvested 24 or 48 h after siRNA transfection. Cell cycle distribution was assayed by staining total cellular DNA with propidium iodide, and results were analyzed by ModFit software. DNA synthesis was determined by the BrdUrd incorporation assay using BrdUrd Flow Kit (Pharmingen). Cells were labeled with BrdUrd for 45 min at 37 °C. After fixation, cells were treated with DNase for 1 h at 37°Cto expose incorporated BrdUrd, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody. Total DNA was stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D. Flow cytometry was performed on FACScan (Pharmingen). Data were analyzed using Winlist (Verify Software House) software. ERα Binds to p53—We used coimmunoprecipitation assay to analyze association between endogenous ERα and p53 proteins in MCF7 (human breast cancer cells containing wild type ERα and wild type p53) cells. ERα was detected by immunobloting in the cell lysate immunoprecipitated by p53 antibody (Fig. 1A). As genomic damage is known to activate p53 (15Fei P. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5774-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and affect its interaction with proteins such as MDM2 and Pin1, we investigated whether the ERα-p53 interaction is sensitive to genomic damage. When MCF7 cells were exposed to γ-radiation, the interaction between endogenous ERα and p53 was disrupted (Fig. 1A). A GST-p53 pull-down assay showed that p53 bound to in vitro-translated wild type ERα, A/B domain deletion mutant ERα Δ1–179, and DNA-binding domain mutant ERα C201H/C205H (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5), whereas ERα Δ283–595 was unable to bind to p53 (Fig. 1B, lane 6), indicating that the 283–395 region containing the ligand-binding and activation function-2 domains is necessary for binding to p53. A similar experiment with different GST-mutant p53 proteins mapped the interaction domain of p53 to the 75 amino acids (319–393) at the COOH terminus (Fig. 1C). It is intriguing that the COOH terminus that is extensively modified in a stress-dependent manner and critical for regulation of p53 function (16Ahn J. Prives C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Krummel K.A. Lee C.J. Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Feng L. Lin T. Uranishi H. Gu W. Xu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5389-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) is targeted by ERα. Purified ERα bound specifically to bacterially expressed GST-p53 resolved on a denaturing gel in a far western assay (supplemental Fig. S3A), further demonstrating direct ERα-p53 interaction. An electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay with extracts of Saos2 (human osteosarcoma cells, p53–/–; very low ERα) cells transfected with p53 and ERα expression plasmids showed that ERα-p53 interaction can occur when either one is bound to its cognate binding site on DNA (supplemental Fig. S1). Interaction of ERα with p53 Bound to Target Gene Promoters in Vivo—As a first step toward investigating how the ERα-p53 interaction affects the transcription of p53-target genes, we used the ChIP assay to analyze their interaction in vivo on a p53-target gene, p21 (CDKN1), in MCF7 cells. Interaction at two p53 sites (5′ site, –2.2 kb and 3′ site, –1.3 kb) (19Resnick-Silverman L. St Clair S. Maurer M. Zhao K. Manfredi J.J. Genes. Dev. 1998; 12: 2102-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was assayed along with a control nonspecific region (–4.3 kb) in the promoter. As expected, p53 bound to both the 5′ and 3′ sites in the non-irradiated (Fig. 2A, lane 3) and in the γ-irradiated cells (Fig. 2A, lane 4). In the non-irradiated cells, ERα was also bound to both the 5′ and 3′ sites (Fig. 2A, lane 7). However, when cells were subjected to genomic damage by ionizing radiation, consistent with the immunoprecipitation data (Fig. 1A), ERα binding to both sites was reduced considerably (Fig. 2A, lane 8 and quantitative ChIP data in supplemental Fig. S3B). A similar pattern (data not shown) of p53 and ERα binding was observed on the p53-response element of the PCNA gene, another transcriptional target of p53 (20Shan B. Xu J. Zhuo Y. Morris C.A. Morris G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44009-44017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis showed that the ERα expression was unaffected, and the p53 level, as expected, was increased by irradiation (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the reduced binding of ERα to p53 on the p21 and PCNA promoters in response to ionizing radiation is not because of altered protein levels. In MCF7 cells where p53 was knocked down, ERα was unable to interact with the p21 promoter (Fig. 2C). Similarly, in p53–/– Saos2 cells, ERα was able to bind to the p53-target promoter only when exogenous p53 was expressed (Fig. 2D; compare lanes 2 and 4). These results demonstrate that ERα is accessing the promoter via the p53 bound to DNA. Furthermore, E2 augments the ERα-p53 interaction, although it is not necessary for interaction (Fig. 2E). Consistent with such an effect of estrogen on the interaction, transcription of p53-target gene p21 is also reduced in the presence of E2 (Fig. 2F). This data along with the finding from a global gene expression profiling in E2-treated MCF7 cells (31Frasor J. Danes J.M. Komm B. Chang K.C. Lyttle C.R. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4562-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) suggest that E2 has a direct repressive effect on p21 transcription. Interestingly, early exposure of rodents to pregnancy levels of E2 and progesterone leads to nuclear accumulation of p53 leading to p53-dependent response to exposure to chemical carcinogens and radiation (21Medina D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 380S-384SCrossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Besides, E2 has been reported to increase p53 gene expression in MCF7 cells (22Qin C. Nguyen T. Stewart J. Samudio I. Burghardt R. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1793-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and p53, on the other hand, transcriptionally up-regulates ERα (23Angeloni S.V. Martin M.B. Garcia-Morales P. Castro-Galache M.D. Ferragut J.A. Saceda M. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 180: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These observations along with our data showing mutual regulation of ERα and p53 levels (Fig. 3D) suggest that delicate mechanisms are at play in balancing the antagonistic functions of these proteins.FIGURE 3ERα represses transcriptional activation by p53. A, plasmids expressing p53 and wild type and mutant ERα were transfected with –1265 PCNA-luc reporter into Saos2 cells, followed by luciferase assay. The data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. B, MCF7 cells transfected with NS or ERα siRNA were harvested at time points indicated and p21 transcripts analyzed by qRT-PCR. C, MCF7 cells transfected as in B were γ-irradiated 24 h post-transfection or left non-irradiated. The cells were harvested 6 h post-irradiation, and p21 transcripts were analyzed as described for B.

In a transient transfection assay in Saos2 cells, p53, as expected (13Karuppayil S.M. Moran E. Das G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17303-17306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), activated transcription of the PCNA-luciferase reporter with wild type p53-binding site (Fig. 3A) but not the reporter with a mutant p53-binding site (data not shown). Wild type ERα repressed transcriptional activation of the PCNA promoter by p53. However, two transcriptionally defective ERα mutants (ER L539A, a coactivator-binding mutant, and ER Δ283–595, a deletion mutant that lacks the entire C terminus containing the activation function-2 domain) were not effective repressors of transcriptional activation by p53. Similar levels of p53 and ERα proteins in cells transfected with p53 and ERα expression constructs either alone or in combination (supplemental Fig. S4) indicate that repression was due to interaction of ERα with p53 bound to the PCNA promoter and not as a consequence of altered p53 or ERα expression. Immunofluorescence followed by confocal microscopy showed that both the wild type ERα and the ER L539A mutant that is incapable of repressing transcriptional activation by p53 (Fig. 3A), but capable of binding to p53 in vitro (data not shown), colocalized with p53 in the nucleus (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, unlike in the case of antagonism between GR and p53 where p53 was sequestered in the cytoplasm (24Sengupta S. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2367-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the repression of p53 function by ERα is not due to unavailability of p53 in the nucleus but rather is a consequence of, as shown by the ChIP assay (Fig. 2), interaction of ERα with p53 bound to the endogenous target gene promoter. As ectopic expression of ERα can repress the transcriptional transactivation by p53 in transfected Saos2 cells, we examined the impact of knocking down endogenous ERα on p53 activity in MCF7 cells. Analysis of mRNA by qRT-PCR showed that transcription of the endogenous p21 gene started to increase as early as 8 h after transfecting ERα siRNA (Fig. 3B) suggesting that increase in p21 transcription is not a consequence of cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, transcription of p21-luciferase reporter was considerably enhanced when ERα was knocked down by siRNA, whereas transcription was severely reduced when either p53 alone or p53 and ERα in combination were knocked down (supplemental Fig. S3C). As expected, γ-irradiation resulted in increased p21 transcript (Fig. 3C) and protein (Fig. 3D) levels in MCF7 cells. The combination of ERα knock down and irradiation produced an additive effect on induction of p21 transcription that led to increased levels of the protein (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, knocking down p53 prevented the radiation-induced increase in transcription, whereas knocking down both p53 and ERα had very little additional effect on p21 transcription indicating that ERα is targeting p53-mediated activation of p21 transcription. Interestingly, transcription of another p53 target, the FAS/APO-1/CD95 (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar) gene, was increased in response to ionizing radiation; however, unlike p21, ERα knockdown did not result in increased FAS gene transcription (data not shown). Thus, the ERα effect on transcriptional activation by p53 appears to be gene-selective, reminiscent of observations that promoter context-specific assembly of transcription complexes could influence function of transcriptional regulators such as p53 (25Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Espinosa J.M. Verdun R.E. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1015-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). ERα Counteracts p53 during Cell Cycle Progression—As MCF7 cells are dependent on active ERα for proliferation, we tested the possibility that ERα may counter p53 during cell cycle progression. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentage of cells in the S phase decreased in ERα knock down cells, whereas it increased in the p53 knock down cells (Fig. 4A). This observation is consistent with increased p21 (Fig. 3D) transcription in ERα knock down cells. Furthermore, BrdUrd incorporation assay revealed decreased S-phase entry in ERα knock down cells, but an opposite effect was observed when p53 was down-regulated (Fig. 4B). Together, these data indicate that antagonizing p53 function is an important component in the proproliferative role of ERα. It is likely that ERα also negatively regulates p53-mediated apoptosis. Future experiments should address this issue. In conclusion, we have uncovered a novel mechanism by which ERα, generally up-regulated in breast cancer (6Shao W. Brown M. Breast Cancer Res. 2004; 6: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8Clarke R.B. Anderson E. Howell A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 316-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suppresses p53 function. Increasing evidence indicates that p53 dysfunction is an important event in breast cancer (27Soussi T. Beroud C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 28Miller L.D. Smeds J. George J. Vega V.B. Vergara L. Ploner A. Pawitan Y. Hall P. Klaar S. Liu E.T. Bergh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13550-13555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). It is possible that interaction between p53 and ERα resulting in their reciprocal regulation plays an important role in regulating normal breast epithelial cell proliferation, and aberration of this control may lead to breast cancer onset and progression. Future studies should reveal the mechanisms and consequences of the interaction under different physiological and pathological contexts. Furthermore, whether ERβ (29Matthews J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Interv. 2003; 3: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) plays any role in this regulatory mechanism remains to be elucidated. Besides unraveling a novel cellular pathway, these results have important clinical implications. ERα binding to p53 resulting in functional inactivation could be one of the reasons for the inability of wild type p53 to restrain the tumor growth and metastasis in ERα-positive breast cancer. Our observations open the opportunity for clinical evaluation of the importance of ERα-p53 interaction in tumors containing wild type ERα and p53. ERα and p53 status of tumors may be useful in developing a rational basis for combination therapy with ERα modulators and radiation. Furthermore, identification of agents that can specifically disrupt protein-protein interaction (30Lane D.P. Fischer P.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 789-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) between p53 and ERα might have cancer preventive and therapeutic potential. We thank J. Atencio and S.

Purified NDH-2 contains a non-covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor and oxidizes NADH with quinones but does not react with either NADPH or oxygen. Ubiquinone-2 (Q2) and decylubiquinone showed high electron-accepting activity, and the steady-state kinetics and the NADH-Q2 oxidoreductase reaction were found to operate by a ping-pong reaction mechanism. Phenothiazine analogues, trifluoperazine, Compound 1, and Compound 2 inhibit the NADH-Q2 reductase activity with IC50 = 12, 11, and 13 μm, respectively. Trifluoperazine inhibition is non-competitive for NADH, whereas the inhibition kinetics is found to be uncompetitive in terms of Q2.

In the present study, we expressed and purified highly active Mtb NDH-2 using a Mycobacterium smegmatis expression system, and the steady-state kinetics and inhibitory actions of phenothiazines were characterized. Purified NDH-2 contains a non-covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor and oxidizes NADH with quinones but does not react with either NADPH or oxygen. Ubiquinone-2 (Q2) and decylubiquinone showed high electron-accepting activity, and the steady-state kinetics and the NADH-Q2 oxidoreductase reaction were found to operate by a ping-pong reaction mechanism. Phenothiazine analogues, trifluoperazine, Compound 1, and Compound 2 inhibit the NADH-Q2 reductase activity with IC50 = 12, 11, and 13 μm, respectively. Trifluoperazine inhibition is non-competitive for NADH, whereas the inhibition kinetics is found to be uncompetitive in terms of Q2. The Gram-positive bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) 3The abbreviations used are: Mtb, Mycobacterium tuberculosis; NDH-2, type-II NADH-dehydrogenase; TPZ, trifluoperazine; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; INH, isoniazid; Q, ubiquinone; Q2, ubiquinone-2. causes tuberculosis, one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Each year nine million active cases of the disease are diagnosed, accounting for three million deaths. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and the existence of “persistent” organisms that are tolerant to antibiotics exacerbate the problem, for which more effective and efficient treatments need to be urgently developed. Mtb is traditionally considered an obligate aerobe, yet during the normal course of events in the infectious cycle, the bacillus is able to survive in conditions of low oxygen and nutrient concentrations, such as those postulated to exist within granulomas. Mtb adapts its metabolic activity, cellular transcription, and protein expression accordingly (1Wayne L.G. Hayes L.G. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2062-2069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore of great importance to understand how Mtb generates ATP under a variety of environmental conditions. Type-II NADH-dehydrogenase (NDH-2) is a critical enzyme in the life cycle of Mtb.

It is noteworthy that this enzyme is not found in mitochondria. The essential role of NDH-2 in Mtb is supported by extensive evidence from biochemical (12Weinstein E.A. Yano T. Li L.S. Avarbock D.

Mtb contains two copies of ndh genes (ndh and ndhA). The Mtb NDH-2 and NDH-2A share 67% sequence identity, and the genes are separated by 17 kb. Mtb NDH-2 is highly homologous to those of Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium smegmatis with 91 and 81% amino acid sequence identity, respectively. A strain of Mtb in which ndh has been disrupted by transposon mutagenesis is nonviable (14Sassetti C.M. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar); however, a ndhA deletion mutant of Mtb can be easily isolated (15McAdam R.A. Quan S. Smith D.A. Bardarov S. Betts J.C. Cook F.C. Hooker E.U. Lewis A.P. Woollard P. Everett M.J. Lukey P.T. Bancroft G.J. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Duncan K. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2975-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that purified NDH-2A is a competent oxidoreductase (12Weinstein E.A. Yano T. Li L.S. Avarbock D. Avarbock A. Helm D. McColm A.A. Duncan K. Lonsdale J.T. Rubin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that ndhA, although present in Mtb, is probably not expressed and cannot rescue mutations in Mtb ndh. NDH-2 is likely to be the sole NADH-dehydrogenase enzyme in the Mtb respiratory chain utilized for growth in an aerobic environment. Isoniazid (INH) and ethambutol are two of the standard anti-tuberculosis medications used throughout the world. Increasing resistance to these medications is recognized as a serious global public health threat. The discovery that a mechanism of INH drug resistance in Mtb is linked to mutations in Mtb NDH-2 that decrease its activity is profoundly important (16Miesel L. Weisbrod T.R. Marcinkeviciene J.A. Bittman R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lee A.S. Teo A.S. Wong S.Y. Antimicrob.

Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 708-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although measured indirectly, INH-resistant mutant NADH oxidase activity is decreased 10–50% compared with the wild-type level. It has been hypothesized that reduced NDH-2 activity in the mutants leads to an increase in the intracellular NADH/NAD+ balance and accounts for the mechanism of INH resistance (16Miesel L. Weisbrod T.R. Marcinkeviciene J.A. Bittman R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Vilcheze C. Weisbrod T.R. Chen B. Kremer L. Hazbon M.H. Wang F. Alland D. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 708-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The present understanding of this effect is that increased concentrations of NADH decrease binding of activated INH adduct to InhA, which is an NADH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase necessary for mycolic acid synthesis in Mtb. The anti-mycobacterial activity of phenothiazines has been reported for a number of years (19Ratnakar P. Murthy P.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 76: 73-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Molnar J.

Trifluoperazine (TPZ) (Fig. 1), for example, reduced in vitro ATP synthesis in M. leprae, suggesting that one of the target sites might be the electron transport pathway itself (25Katoch V.M. Saxena N. Shivannavar C.T. Sharma V.D. Katoch K. Sharma R.K. Murthy P.S. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1998; 20: 99-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TPZ is effective against a virulent Mtb strain H37Rv in a macrophage model of infection, and it is synergistic with both INH and rifampicin (26Crowle A.J. Douvas G.S. May M.H.

Chemother. 1996; 37: 196-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In our previous investigation (12Weinstein E.A. Yano T. Li L.S. Avarbock D. Avarbock A. Helm D. McColm A.A. Duncan K. Lonsdale J.T. Rubin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we have shown that phenothiazines block NADH-dependent oxygen consumption by Mtb membranes. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that phenothiazines inhibit purified recombinant ndh and ndhA and hinder growth of Mtb both in culture and in a mouse model of tuberculosis. Although NDH-2 is essential for growth in Mtb and plays an important role in drug resistance, little is known about the catalytic reaction mechanism of NDH-2 nor is the mode of action of inhibitors of the enzyme well characterized. Therefore, in-depth understanding of the reaction catalyzed by NDH-2 is crucial to predicting and controlling the behavior of the organism. In the present study, the kinetic properties of the enzyme and the mode of action of phenothiazines were investigated in detail using highly active NDH-2 enzyme purified in an M. smegmatis expression system. Bacterial Culture and Conditions—E. coli strains and their plasmid-harboring derivatives were grown in Luria broth medium containing appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml hygromycin) at 37 °C. M. smegmatis and its transconjugants were aerobically grown in 7H9 medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin at 37 °C. Molecular Cloning of Mtb ndh and ndhA Genes and Construction of Expression Plasmids—All DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard protocols as described in Ref. 28Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold spring Harbor Press, New York1989Google Scholar. Mtb ndh was amplified by PCR with genomic DNA from M. tuberculosis as a template using the following PCR primers: ndh forward primer, 5′-AGCTATGGATCCATGAGTCCCCAGCAAGAACCCACA-3′; ndh reverse primer, 5′-AGCTATTCTAGACTAATGATGATGATGATGATGGCTGGCCACCTTAGCGCTTGC-3′. PCR was carried out by 30 cycles of amplification step gradient (98 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min). The PCR product of the ndh gene was digested by BamHI and XbaI and was inserted under an acetamidase upstream promoter of the pOLYG plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. V. Mizrahi, National Health Laboratory Service). The final construct (Ndh/polyace) was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Expression of Recombinant Mtb Ndh in M. smegmatis—The expression plasmid Ndh/polyace was transferred into M. smegmatis cells by electroporation. A well isolated colony was picked and inoculated in 2 ml of 7H9 medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin. To induce protein expression, 2% (w/v) acetamide was added and cells were grown to stationary phase at 37 °C for 2–3 days. Harvested cells were suspended in Hepes/phosphate buffer (50 mm Hepes/100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored at –80 °C. Purification of Mtb Ndh from M. smegmatis—The cells were broken by sonication on ice with a Brown Sonifier in a pulse mode with 30% output for 5 min × 3 times. The suspension was centrifuged at 6,000 revolutions/min for 15 min to precipitate unbroken cells and debris. The supernatant was further ultracentrifuged at 45,000 revolutions/min for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in Hepes/phosphate buffer and ultracentrifuged again. Potassium cholate and potassium deoxycholate was added to the membrane suspensions (∼5 mg/ml) at a final concentration of 2% (w/v) for each detergent, and the suspension was sonicated briefly and incubated on ice for 1 h with gentle stirring. The detergent extract was obtained by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 revolutions/min for 30 min. TALON resin (1 ml bed volume) was added to the detergent extract, and the suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was transferred to a small column (1 × 10 cm) and washed with 20 ml of Hepes/phosphate buffer containing 1% (w/v) cholate followed by 40 ml of Hepes/phosphate buffer containing 1% (w/v) cholate and 10 mm imidazole. The bound proteins were eluted with Hepes/phosphate buffer containing 1% (w/v) cholate and 150 mm imidazole, and active fractions were pooled. Glycerol was added to be 40% (w/v), and the enzyme was quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Enzyme Assay—The standard reaction buffer contained 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 150 mm NaCl. For NAD(P)H-Q oxidoreductase assay, 100 μm NAD(P)H and 40 μm Q were used. The reaction was initiated by adding Q and was monitored spectrophotometrically by following the absorbance changes at 340–400 nm (Δϵ340–400 nm = 6000 m–1 cm–1) at 30 °C. The specific activities mentioned above were calculated using the respective extinction coefficients. For inhibitor titration, the enzyme was preincubated with various concentrations of inhibitors in the reaction buffer at room temperature for 2–3 min. Flavin Extraction Analysis—Extraction of flavin was attempted from the purified protein in the presence of 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation for 15 min. The purified enzyme was also subjected to proteinase K digestion in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C overnight. Trichloroacetic acid was added to be 6% (w/v), and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation. Fluorescence of the supernatant obtained above was measured with an excitation wavelength at 446 nm and an emission wavelength at 530 nm. The type of flavin was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy according to Ref. 29Faeder E. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar. Other Biochemical Analyses—Protein concentration was determined by Lowry's method (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Materials—Expression vector, pOLYG plasmid, was a kind gift from Dr. V. Mizrahi. All chemicals used were of the highest grade available from Sigma. Expression and Purification of Highly Active Mtb NDH-2—In our previous investigation (12Weinstein E.A. Yano T. Li L.S. Avarbock D. Avarbock A. Helm D. McColm A.A. Duncan K. Lonsdale J.T. Rubin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we have expressed Mtb NDH-2 (ndh and ndhA genes) in E. coli and have obtained enzymatically active preparations. The enzymes oxidized NADH with quinone and were inhibited by phenothiazine analogues. However, the purified ndh and ndhA products had very low specific activities (∼0.1 unit mg–1) and were not stable. In our efforts to obtain highly active and stable enzymes, we expressed Mtb ndh in M. smegmatis as described under “Experimental Procedures”. Mtb NDH-2 was expressed and localized to the cytoplasmic membranes and could be extracted with detergents. The Mtb NDH-2 expressed with a His tag at its C terminus was readily purified by a single metal affinity column chromatography to an electrophoretically highly homogenous state (Fig. 2A). The purified Mtb NDH-2 was ∼50 kDa, as expected from the DNA sequence, and specifically recognized by the anti-His tag antibody (Fig. 2B). The purified NDH-2 exhibited specific activity as high as 20–25 units mg–1, which is >200-fold higher than that of the previous preparations. Approximately 2 mg of a highly pure NDH-2 enzyme was obtained from 15 g (wet weight) of cells. Spectroscopic and Enzymatic Properties of the Purified Mtb NDH-2—The Mtb NDH-2 exhibited several noteworthy features. The absorption spectra of the light-yellow Mtb NDH-2 is shown in Fig. 3A. The enzyme, as purified, exhibited broad absorption peaks at 365 and 450 nm, characteristic of flavin. A slight contamination of heme-like impurities was recognized at 420 nm. This peak height varied among preparations. The protein was weakly fluorescent. With an excitation at 446 nm, a fluorescence emission was detected at 523 nm (data not shown). Upon the addition of 2.2 m guanidine-HCl, the emission band increased 2.8-fold higher, indicating that the protein was unfolded and the flavin was exposed to solvent. Fig. 3B shows emission and excitation spectra of the purified Mtb NDH-2 in the presence of 2.2 m guanidine-HCl. The excitation spectrum of the flavin exhibited two peaks at 378 and 448 nm, whereas only one emission band at 530 nm was observed. The bound flavin could be extracted with 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. By fluorescence spectroscopy, we identified the bound flavin to be flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Mtb NDH-2 expressed in M. smegmatis rapidly lost its catalytic activity at pH 8.0 and higher. This alkaline-sensitive nature was also observed for the purified Mtb NDH-2 (see next paragraph). The NDH-2 was also highly sensitive to detergents. Among a number of different types of detergents tested, only potassium cholate was able to solubilize Mtb NDH-2 from the membranes without losing enzymatic activity. Mtb NDH-2 lost activity immediately after the addition of Triton X-100 and dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, which have been successfully used for purification of NDH-2 from other organisms, such as E. coli (3Young I.G. Poulis M.I. Gene. 1978; 4: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 4Bjorklof K. Zickermann V. Finel M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and C. glutamicum (7Matsushita K. Otofuji A. Iwahashi M. Toyama H. Adachi O. FEMS Microbiol.

Biochem. 2005; 69: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Incubation of Mtb cytoplasmic membranes with these detergents or in alkaline buffer resulted in immediate loss of the enzymatic activity of the native NDH-2. 4T. Yano, L.-S. Li, E. Weinstein, J.-S. Teh, and H. Rubin, unpublished results. The purified NDH-2 retained its high catalytic activity in the presence of 40% (w/v) glycerol and could be stored at –80 °C for up to one month without any noticeable loss of the enzymatic activity. Steady-state Electron Transfer Kinetics of the Purified Mtb NDH-2—To characterize the enzymatic properties of the purified Mtb NDH-2, we first examined the pH dependence and substrate specificity. Mtb NDH-2 catalyzes NADH-Q oxidoreductase reaction with a pH optimum of 7.0 (Fig. 4). The enzymatic activity sharply dropped at pH 8.0 and higher due to irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. We also examined NADPH as an electron donor; however, Mtb NDH-2 did not show any detectable NADPH-Q oxidoreductase activity within a pH range of 4.0–9.0. In addition, we did not detect electron transfer activity to oxygen (NAD(P)H oxidase activity), unlike NDH-2 from S. cerevisiae and C. glutamicum, as reported earlier (35Nantapong N. Otofuji A. Migita C.T. Adachi O. Toyama H. Matsushita K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We measured the electron transfer activities using various quinone analogues. Among the ubiquinone analogues tested, ubiquinone-2 was found to show the highest activity (Table 1). Reduction of Q2 and n-decylubiquinone was inhibited by 50 μm TPZ to 85 and 76%, respectively. NADH-Q2 reductase activity was inhibited to 95% by 100 μm TPZ. Because the NADH oxidase activity of the NDH-2-dominant Mtb respiratory chain is completely blocked by TPZ, as demonstrated earlier (12Weinstein E.A. Yano T. Li L.S. Avarbock D. Avarbock A. Helm D. McColm A.A. Duncan K. Lonsdale J.T. Rubin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the TPZ-sensitive electron transfer activities of the purified NDH-2 with Q2 and n-decylubiquinone seem to reflect the physiological reaction with endogenous quinone in the Q pool. On the other hand, the NADH-Q1 reductase activity was only partially sensitive to TPZ and could not be fully inhibited by high concentrations of TPZ. Menaquinone analogues, phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and menaquinone-4 (vitamin K2), showed lower electron transfer activities compared with those for ubiquinone analogues. The Km value for phylloquinone is 7.8 μm. The electron transfer activities with these menaquinone analogues are also sensitive to TPZ. Water-soluble naphthoquinone analogues, 1,4-naphthoquinone (α-naphthoquinone) and 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione), were also reduced by Mtb NDH-2 with moderate specific activities 3.4 units/mg and 5.9 units/mg, respectively. These electron transfer activities were not fully sensitive to TPZ, indicating that reduction of these compounds may not reflect the physiological electron transfer reactions.TABLE 1Apparent Km and Vmax values of the NADH-acceptor reductase activities of the purified Mtb NDH-2 and % inhibition by TPZSubstrateKm(app)Vmax(app)aOne unit is defined as 1 μmol of NADH oxidized min-1.Vmax(app)/Km(app)Inhibition by 50 μm TPZbPercentage inhibition of the NADH-acceptor reductase activities by 50 μm TPZ was determined using 100 μm NADH and 40 μm quinone analogues.μmunits mg-1%Ubiquinone-2cNADH was used as an electron donor at a fixed concentration of 100 μm.6.42.7585DBQcNADH was used as an electron donor at a fixed concentration of 100 μm.4.811.02.2976PhylloquinonecNADH was used as an electron donor at a fixed concentration of 100 μm.7.80.950.1281Menaquinone-4cNADH was used as an electron donor at a fixed concentration of 100 μm.NDeND, not determined.NDeND, not determined.NDeND, not determined.90Ubiquinone-1cNADH was used as an electron donor at a fixed concentration of 100 μm.ND12.2fSpecific activities were given for these electron acceptors.

Open table in a new tab Electron Transfer by Mtb NDH-2 Follows a Ping-Pong Tetra Uni Reaction Mechanism—Next, we investigated the kinetic mode of the electron transfer reactions of Mtb NDH-2 with Q2 as an electron acceptor. Fig. 5 shows a Hanes-Woolf plot of the NADH-Q2 oxidoreductase reaction with varying Q concentrations and a fixed concentration of NADH. The lines for the respective reaction conditions intersect nearly on the y-axis. In a Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 5, inset), slopes (Vmax/Km) of the lines are not affected by NADH concentrations. These results indicate that the NADH-Q2 oxidoreductase reaction operates by a ping-pong tetra uni reaction mechanism, where the NDH-2 interacts with NADH and Q separately without forming a ternary complex. We analyzed the kinetic data using the following equation for the ping-pong reaction mechanism without substrate inhibition: ν=Vmax[NADH][Q2]/KmQ2[NADH]+KmNADH[Q2]+[NADH][Q2]. We obtained the kinetic parameters, KmNADH=42 μ M, KmQ2=12.5 μM, and Vmax = 26 unit mg–1. Inhibition Kinetics of Phenothiazine, TPZ on Mtb NDH-2—Previously (12Weinstein E.A. Yano T. Li L.S.

A. 2005; 102: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that phenothiazines effectively suppress the growth of Mtb in vitro as well as in a mouse model and have provided biochemical evidence that the drugs inhibit the electron transfer activity of the Mtb NDH-2 in membranes as well as the purified recombinant enzymes. To better understand the mode of action of phenothiazines on Mtb NDH-2, we examined the effects of phenothiazines on the steady-state kinetics of the highly active purified enzyme. Fig. 6 shows the titration of the NADH-Q2 oxidoreductase activity with several phenothiazine analogues. TPZ, Compound 1, and Compound 2 effectively inhibit NADH-Q2 oxidoreductase activity with IC50 values of 12, 11, and 13 μm, respectively, indicating nearly equal potency under the conditions used. The compounds inhibited the oxidation of NADH with Q2 almost completely (>95%) at 80 μm and higher, suggesting that reduction of Q2 occurs at the physiological Q binding site as observed in situ. An inhibitor, flavone, on the other hand, poorly inhibited the NADH-Q2 oxidoreductase activity of Mtb NDH-2 with IC50 = 170 μm, and the activity could not be completely inhibited by higher concentrations of flavone (data not shown). Fig. 7A shows a double reciprocal plot of TPZ inhibition kinetics of the NADH-Q2 oxidoreductase activity in terms of NADH. The lines diverge and intersect on the 1/[NADH] axis, suggesting that the inhibition kinetics is non-competitive in terms of NADH. The inhibition kinetics with respect to Q2 revealed a different inhibition pattern. In a double reciprocal plot shown in Fig. 7B, the slopes of the lines are nearly constant at different concentrations of TPZ, suggesting that the inhibition kinetics follows an uncompetitive mode.FIGURE 7Double reciprocal plot of TPZ inhibition kinetics of the purified Mtb NDH-2. NADH-Q2 oxidoreductase activities were measured in the presence of various concentrations of TPZ. TPZ concentrations used were: 0μm (closed circle), 20μm (open circle), 40μm (closed triangle), and 60μm (open square). A, Q2 concentration was fixed at 40μm, and NADH concentration was varied. B, NADH concentration was fixed at 100 μm, and Q2 concentration was varied.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we successfully obtained highly active and stable recombinant enzyme by using M. smegmatis as a host. Characterization of the Mtb NDH-2 revealed several intriguing properties. One of the findings is that the Mtb NDH-2 contains a non-covalently bound FAD as a cofactor. NDH-2 has been classified into three distinct groups (groups A, B, and C) depending on characteristic structural signatures in the primary sequence (36Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Members of group A have two nucleotide binding motifs where NAD(P)H and flavin are bound. Group A NDH-2 enzymes, such as those from E. coli and C. glutamicum, contain a noncovalently bound FAD. The primary sequence of Mtb NDH-2 indicates that this enzyme is categorized as group A. The biochemical properties of the Mtb NDH-2 revealed in the present study are in good agreement with those predicted for group A. The specific activity of the Mtb NDH-2 expressed in M. smegmatis is 200-fold greater than the previous preparations that were expressed in E. coli. The expression and purification of the highly active enzyme permitted us to characterize the enzymatic properties of Mtb NDH-2, observing a number of unique properties of the enzyme. First, Mtb NDH-2 exclusively catalyzes the oxidation of NADH with quinones and does not use either NADPH or oxygen as substrates under any conditions examined in this study. NDH-2 homologues from E. coli (37Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10119-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), C. glutamicum (35Nantapong N. Otofuji A. Migita C.T. Adachi O. Toyama H. Matsushita K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and Trypanosoma brucei (38Fang J. Beattie D.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have been reported to reduce oxygen by a single electron to produce harmful reactive oxygen species. Although it remains unknown whether reactive oxygen species produced by other NDH-2s play any physiological role, electron transfer without electron leak to oxygen, as seen in Mtb NDH-2, ensures efficient respiratory activity and reduces exogenous oxidative stress. Second, the purified Mtb NDH-2 is able to reduce various ubiquinone analogues, and thus far, Q2 shows the highest catalytic activity. The electron transfer activity is fully sensitive to TPZ inhibition. On the other hand, the reductase activity with less hydrophobic Q1 is only partially inhibited by TPZ. These results suggest that the Mtb NDH-2 interacts with these quinones differently. It is implied that the hydrophobic alkyl chain at the 3 position plays an important role in the interactions of quinone with the physiological binding site of the NDH-2. The Mtb NDH-2 can reduce menaquinone analogues, phylloquinone and menaquinone-4, in a TPZ-sensitive manner; however, the specific activities are much lower than those with ubiquinones. Because Mtb contains menaquinone-9 in the Q pool (39Collins M.D. Shah H.N. Minnikin D.E. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1980; 48: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the low catalytic activities of the Mtb NDH-2 with menaquinones are rather unexpected. A low midpoint redox potential of menaquinone (Em for menaquinone =–100 mV versus Em for ubiquinone =+90 mV) partially contributes to the slower electron transfer rates. It should be noted that Mtb NDH-2 in Mtb or M. smegmatis membranes also show much lower electron transfer activities with menaquinone than ubiquinone. 5T. Yano, L.-S. Li, E. Weinstein, J.-S. Teh, and H. Rubin, unpublished data. Thus, it is possible that the low catalytic activity with menaquinone is intrinsic to the nature of Mtb NDH-2. The present steady-state kinetics study revealed that the NADH-Q2 oxidoreductase reaction of the purified NDH-2 follows a ping-pong reaction mechanism, where NDH-2 reacts with NADH and Q in two separate reaction steps without forming a ternary complex. The mechanism predicts that following reduction of FAD with NADH to FADH2 and release of NAD+, Q binds to its binding site and accepts electrons from an isoalloxazine ring of flavin. The ping-pong reaction mechanism has been proposed for NDH-2 homologues from fungal mitochondria (40Eschemann A. Galkin A. Oettmeier W. Brandt U. Kerscher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3138-3142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41Velazquez I. Pardo J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 389: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Without structural support and further analysis, the current kinetic data cannot provide any information about the mechanism of the interaction of Mtb NDH-2 with the two substrates separately. It is suggested that NADH in the cytoplasm and menaquinone-9 in the membrane approach the isoalloxazine ring of FAD through distinct pathways to carry out the respective electron transfer reactions. NADH binds to the NADH binding site containing the 20GXGXXG25 motif (Mtb numbering). Although secondary structure analytical programs could not find any transmembrane α-helices in the Mtb NDH-2, several programs (DAS, HMMTOP, SOSUI, and THM) predict one or possibly two α-helices near the C terminus (between Ala385 and Ile410) that may form an amphipathic α-helix rich in positively charged amino acid residues (His, Arg, and Lys) and hydrophobic amino acid residues (Tyr, Trp, etc.). The present study suggests that the hydrophobic isoprenoid unit plays an important role in preferential binding to the site mentioned above. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the membrane interaction domain provides an amphipathic structure that guides a hydrophilic menaquinone ring part of menaquinone-9 to the isoalloxazine ring of flavin from the lipid layer. Structural information describing the catalytic sites is essential for better understanding of the reaction mechanism of the NDH-2. The successful expression and purification of the highly active NDH-2 demonstrated in this study opens a way to characterize structural details of Mtb NDH-2 by utilizing site-directed mutagenesis and several biochemical approaches. Such attempts are currently being made in our laboratory to understand the kinetic and structural mechanism of Mtb NDH-2. All three phenothiazine compounds examined in the present study inhibit the Mtb NDH-2 activity with the same potency of IC50 = 10 μm, despite the fact that chemical structures of these compounds vary as shown in Fig. 1. Phenothiazines are composed of two major structural units in general, a large heterocyclic 3-ring and a side chain attached to the N terminus of the phenothiazine ring. These unique structures do not resemble either NADH or quinone. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that phenothiazines bind to the NADH or Q binding site and competitively inhibit the enzymatic reactions. TPZ appears to combine with and inhibit an intermediate species formed during catalysis, such as NDH-(FADred)-NAD+ complex or NDH(FADH2). It is implied that the binding of TPZ analogues interfere with release of products or binding of substrate. The present study suggests that a structure common among these three compounds, indicated by the broken line in Fig. 1, is essential for their inhibitory activities. In conjunction with the in vivo studies, our inhibition study with Mtb NDH-2 provides valuable information on the structure-activity relationships of phenothiazines. Such information may be useful for development of more potent anti-tubercular drugs in the future. We thank Prof. Tomoko Ohnishi (University of Pennsylvania) for her kind support."

The importance of MT1-MMP, in particular, is highlighted by its ability to activate pro-MMP-2 at the cell surface through the formation of a trimolecular complex comprised of MT1-MMP/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2)/pro-MMP-2. TIMPs 1-4 are physiological MMP inhibitors with distinct roles in the regulation of pro-MMP-2 processing. Here, we have shown that individual Timp deficiencies differentially affect MMP-2 processing using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Timp-3 deficiency accelerated pro-MMP-2 activation in response to both cytochalasin D and concanavalin A. Exogenous TIMP-2 and N-TIMP-3 inhibited this activation, whereas TIMP-3 containing matrix from wild-type MEFs did not rescue the enhanced MMP-2 activation in Timp-3-/- cells. Increased processing of MMP-2 did not arise from increased expression of MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, or MT3-MMP or altered expression of TIMP-2 and MMP-2. To test whether increased MMP-2 processing in Timp-3-/- MEFs is dependent on TIMP-2, double deficient Timp-2-/-/-3-/- MEFs were used. In these double deficient cells, the cleavage of pro-MMP-2 to its intermediate form was substantially increased, but the subsequent cleavage of intermediate-MMP-2 to fully active form, although absent in Timp-2-/- MEFs, was detectable with combined Timp-2-/-/-3-/- deficiency. TIMP-4 associates with MMP-2 and MT1-MMP in a manner similar to TIMP-3, but its deletion had no effect on pro-MMP-2 processing. Thus, TIMP-3 provides an inherent regulation over the kinetics of pro-MMP-2 processing, serving at a level distinct from that of TIMP-2 and TIMP-4.

Understanding the regulation of pro-MMP-2 processing by MT1-MMP and other members of the MT-MMP family is central to defining their role in cancer biology. The classical model for the cell surface activation of MMP-2 is through the formation of a trimolecular complex comprising MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, and pro-MMP-2 (15Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). The transmembrane MT1-MMP interacts via its N-terminal domain to the N terminus of TIMP-2, forming a “receptor” onto which pro-MMP-2 (72 kDa) binds. Pro-MMP-2 is initially cleaved to its intermediate form (64 kDa) by an adjacent active MT1-MMP. The second stage of MMP-2 processing, resulting in its fully active form (62 kDa), involves an autocatalytic event that requires an MMP-2 molecule in trans (16Atkinson S.J. Crabbe T. Cowell S.

Although the dynamics of the trimolecular complex have been well studied, new insights into its regulation and control are continually being discovered. More recently, cell surface processing of pro-MMP-2 is reported to occur through formation of a trimolecular complex comprised of MT3-MMP, TIMP-3, and pro-MMP-2 (25Zhao H. Bernardo M.M. Osenkowski P.

TIMPs are the naturally occurring inhibitors of metalloproteinase activity. There are four members of the TIMP family, and each has a specific niche with respect to function. Studies have focused on the dual role of TIMP-2 in regulating the processing of pro-MMP-2. A threshold level of TIMP-2 is required in relation to MT1-MMP to construct the trimolecular complex, which still leaves sufficient MT1-MMP uninhibited to cleave pro-MMP-2. At higher concentrations, TIMP-2 prevents MMP-2 processing by inhibiting all free MT1-MMP (27Sato H. Kinoshita T. Takino T. Nakayama K. Seiki M.

In the Timp-3-deficient mouse we have previously observed greater matrix degradation, indicating increased MMP activity, as well as unscheduled MMP-2 activation (44Fata J.E. Leco K.J. Voura E.B.

In the present study we used primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Timp-deficient mice to determine the physiological roles of individual TIMPs in pro-MMP-2 processing. Timp-3-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) displayed an accelerated rate of pro-MMP-2 processing, whereas Timp-4-/- MEFs showed no alteration. We further investigated the necessity of TIMP-2 during the activation process in Timp-3-/- cells using double deficient Timp-2-/-/Timp-3-/- MEFs. This study provides a comprehensive parallel assessment of each TIMP in cell surface processing of pro-MMP-2 and highlights a unique regulatory function of TIMP-3. Experimental Animals—Timp-3-/- mice were generated as previously described (47Leco K.J. Waterhouse P. Sanchez O.H. Gowing K.L. Poole A.R. Wakeham A. Mak T.W. Khokha R. J. Clin.

Controls included mice with identical backgrounds to the experimental animals. All animals were cared for in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council for Animal Care. MEF Isolation and Maintenance of Cells—Primary MEFs were isolated from embryos at day 13.5-15.5 of gestation. Cells were maintained in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum. All experiments were performed using non-immortalized MEF cultures maintained for 4-6 passages. Cell stimulation experiments were carried out in 24-well culture dishes, and cells were seeded the night prior to the experiment at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 1 ml of DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum. The following day the subconfluent monolayers were washed twice with serum-free DMEM prior to treatment with concanavalin A (con A; 10 or 50 μg/ml) or cytochalasin D (cyto D; 1 μg/ml) (Sigma) in serum-free DMEM supplemented with insulin transferrin, sodium-selenite (Sigma) in a 250-μl volume. At a given time point conditioned medium and lysates (prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1% nonident P40, 1% Triton X-100 + inhibitors) were collected. TIMP Purification and Inhibition Experiments—Human recombinant TIMP-1 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary K-1 cells and purified from the conditioned medium (50Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Human recombinant TIMP-2 was expressed in 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) using the mammalian expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen). TIMP-2 was purified from the condition medium as described previously (51Troeberg L. Tanaka M. Wait R. Shi Y.E. Brew K. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15025-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recombinant N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 (N-TIMP-3) was prepared as described by Kashiwagi et al. (52Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Each TIMP was added at 10, 25, 50, 75, or 100 nm 1 h prior to the addition of cyto D. N-TIMP-3 was dissolved in a glycerol-containing buffer (0.125%), and this was included as an experimental control (data not shown). Synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitors used included GM6001 (Chemicon) and PD166793 (Pfizer Inc.) (48Kassiri Z. Oudit G.Y. Sanchez O. Dawood F. Mohammed F.F. Nuttall R.K. Edwards D.R. Liu P.P.

Gelatin Zymography—Cell-conditioned medium and lysates were analyzed for MMP-2 activity by gelatin zymography. Samples were prepared in non-reducing conditions in 5× sample buffer (0.625 m Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2% Bromphenol Blue and resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels containing 0.5 mg/ml of gelatin Type A from porcine skin (Sigma). The gels were washed twice in 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 at room temperature before incubation in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 30 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide (TAB). Incubation conditions were either overnight at room temperature or at 37 °C, depending on gelatinase activity in the samples. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 15 min and destained with MeOH/acetic acid to reveal zones of gelatinase activity (54Heussen C. Dowdle E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). Reverse Zymography—Extracellular matrix retrieved from MEF cultures was analyzed for the presence of TIMP-3 by reverse gelatin zymography. After the removal of cells from the culture dish with 10 mm EDTA/EGTA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, the underlying matrix was dissolved with non-reducing sample buffer and the sample loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel containing 1 mg/ml of gelatin and conditioned medium from BHK cells (42Leco K.J.

The gel was washed once in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min before an overnight incubation at room temperature in TAB containing 2.5% Triton X-100. The following day the buffer was changed to TAB alone and the gel incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destained as above. A parallel 12% SDS-PAGE gel was silver stained to compare loading and position of major protein bands. Staining of proteins was achieved using a Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad). Western Blotting—Cell lysates isolated in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer were added to 6× sample buffer (300 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 60% glycerol, 12% SDS, 12 mm EDTA, 864 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Bromphenol Blue) and resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in 5% milk in TBST (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and probed with primary antibody against MT1-MMP, RP2-MMP-14 (Triple Point Biologics, Inc.), followed by a secondary antibody to rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling). Bands were revealed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). A lysate of HT1080 cells stimulated with con A was run as a positive control for MT1-MMP. Matrix Swap Assay—MEFs were seeded onto 6-well plates at a density of 2.4 × 105 cells/ml in 3 ml of DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were left in culture for 7-10 days to allow for matrix deposition before detachment from the underlying matrix with 10 mm EDTA/10 mm EGTA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0. Fresh cultures of wildtype or Timp-3-/- cells were then seeded onto matrix of the same genotype or “swapped” at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 3 ml of DMEM + insulin transferrin, sodium-selenite (Sigma). Cells were left to attach for 1.5 h before the monolayers were washed twice with DMEM and 1.5 ml of DMEM + ITS with or without cytochalasin D (1 μg/ml). After 4 h conditioned medium was collected and MMP-2 activity analyzed by gelatin zymography. Quantitative Taqman Real-time PCR—Quantification of expression of MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, TIMP-4, and MMP-2 was performed using the Applied Biosystems ABI prism 7700 sequence detection system (Taqman) (15Strongin A.Y.

Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA extracted from primary MEF cultures with or without the addition of cytochalasin D (1 μg/ml) using SV Total RNA isolation system (Promega) was reverse transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) using random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences). Taqman reactions were carried out in 96-well plates using 0.5% cDNA, 12.5 μl of 2× Taqman universal PCR master mix, 100 μm probe, and 200 μm of each primer and water to a final volume of 25 μl. 18S rRNA was used as an endogenous control. Primer sequences for murine MMPs and TIMPs were as described (56Wells J.E. Rice T.K. Nuttall R.K. Edwards D.R. Zekki H. Rivest S. Yong V.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10107-10115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MT1-MMP Activity Assay—Cell membranes were prepared from seven subconfluent T75 culture flasks after 6 h of culture with or without cyto D (1 μg/ml) for each genotype following the protocol described by Ward et al.

A 1:250 dilution of each preparation was used to assess the MT1-MMP activity using a Matrix Metalloproteinase-14 Biotrak Activity Assay system (Amersham Biosciences).

MMP-2 activation was studied over the course of 24 h using SDS-PAGE gelatin zymography of cell lysates and conditioned medium. Comparable pro-MMP-2 levels were present in unstimulated wild-type (WT) and Timp-3-/- MEFs. Over time, both the WT and Timp-3-/- MEFs responded to cyto D and con A stimulation by the appearance of processed forms (intermediate and active) of MMP-2. In the conditioned medium from WT cells, active MMP-2 was first detectable after 3 h (Fig. 1A, panel 1, lane 2) of cyto D stimulation, becoming more apparent by 6 h (panel 2, lane 2), and with robust activation by 24 h (panel 3, lane 2). Compared with cyto D stimulation, con A treatment (50 μg/ml) showed slower kinetics of MMP-2 activation with the appearance of intermediate MMP-2 by 6 h (Fig. 1A, panel 2, lane 3) and further processing similar to cyto D by 24 h (panel 3, lane 3). At the lower concentration of con A (10 μg/ml), the process of pro-MMP-2 activation was much slower but still accelerated in Timp3-/- MEFs. Specifically, greater MMP-2 activation was now seen at 24 h (data not shown). With respect to MMP-9, we observed that pro-MMP-9 was induced over 24 h following con A and cyto D treatments; however, MMP-9 levels remained comparable between WT and Timp-3-/- groups. In the Timp-3 null MEF cultures, pro-MMP-2 processing was clearly accelerated. Comparing the conditioned medium from WT and Timp-3-/- cells, enhanced kinetics of pro-MMP-2 activation was evident. Both the intermediate and fully processed enzyme species were present at higher levels in 3-h conditioned medium after treatment with cyto D, and the robust appearance of the intermediate form was apparent following con A treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6). The processing of pro-MMP-2 to its fully active form following cyto D treatment was more pronounced at 6 h (Fig. 1A, lane 11), and full processing after con A treatment was also evident (Fig. 1A, lane 12). By 24 h similar levels of fully activated MMP-2 were seen in WT and Timp-3-deficient cells (lanes 14 and 15, 16 and 17). Increased MMP-2 activation was not observed in the unstimulated primary Timp-3-/- MEF cultures. This effect of accelerated MMP-2 processing due to the loss of TIMP-3 was mirrored in analyses performed with cell lysates (Fig. 1B). In fact, as early as 1 h post-stimulation, processing of pro-MMP-2 was observed in the Timp-3-/- MEFs lysates, whereas none was apparent in the wildtype cells (data not shown). These data indicate an accelerated rate of MMP-2 processing in the absence of TIMP-3.

Here, we report the identification of Bcl2 as a direct target gene of GATA4 that may mediate the prosurvival function of GATA4 in cardiomyocytes. Bcl2 transcript and protein levels were reduced by doxorubicin in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVC) and in mouse heart as determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The reduction in Bcl2 was prevented by overexpression of GATA4 in NRVC and in transgenic mouse heart. Also, expression of GATA4 increased baseline Bcl2 levels by 30% in NRVC and 2.7-fold in transgenic heart, indicating the sufficiency of GATA4 to up-regulate Bcl2 gene expression. GATA4 knockdown by siRNA reduced Bcl2 levels by 48% in NRVC, suggesting that GATA4 is required for Bcl2 constitutive gene expression. Transfection of HEK cells with GATA4 plasmids activated Bcl2 promoter and elevated Bcl2 protein levels. Deletion and mutagenesis analysis revealed that a consensus GATA motif at base -266 on the promoter conserved across multiple species is partially responsible for the promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that GATA4 directly bound to this GATA site. Together, these results indicate that GATA4 positively regulates cardiac Bcl2 gene expression in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2095134835,"Accumulation of damaged proteins is causally related to many age-related diseases. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) plays a role in selective degradation of damaged proteins, whereas molecular chaperones, such as heat shock proteins, are involved in refolding denatured proteins. This work demonstrates for the first time that the UPP and molecular chaperones work in a competitive manner and that the fates of denatured proteins are determined by the relative activities of the UPP and molecular chaperones. Enhanced UPP activity suppresses the refolding of denatured proteins whereas elevated chaperone activity inhibits the degradation of denatured proteins. CHIP, a co-chaperone with E3 activity, plays a pivotal role in determining the fates of the damaged proteins. The delicate balance between UPP-mediated degradation and refolding of denatured proteins is governed by relative levels of CHIP and other molecular chaperones. Isopeptidases, the enzymes that reverse the actions of CHIP, also play an important role in determining the fate of denatured proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1983052810,"Signal transduction underlying bacterial chemotaxis involves excitatory phosphorylation and feedback control through deamidation and methylation of sensory receptors. The structure of a complex between the signal-terminating phosphatase, CheC, and the receptor-modifying deamidase, CheD, reveals how CheC mimics receptor substrates to inhibit CheD and how CheD stimulates CheC phosphatase activity. CheD resembles other cysteine deamidases from bacterial pathogens that inactivate host Rho-GTPases. CheD not only deamidates receptor glutamine residues contained within a conserved structural motif but also hydrolyzes glutamyl-methyl-esters at select regulatory positions. Substituting Gln into the receptor motif of CheC turns the inhibitor into a CheD substrate. Phospho-CheY, the intracellular signal and CheC target, stabilizes the CheC:CheD complex and reduces availability of CheD. A point mutation that dissociates CheC from CheD impairs chemotaxis in vivo. Thus, CheC incorporates an element of an upstream receptor to influence both its own effect on receptor output and that of its binding partner, CheD."

Tyrosine sulfation plays an important role in the function of some known TPST substrates by enhancing protein-protein interactions. To explore the role of these enzymes in vivo and gain insight into other potential TPST substrates, TPST-2-deficient mice were generated by targeted disruption of the Tpst2 gene. Tpst2+/- mice appear normal and, when interbred, yield litters of normal size with a Mendelian distribution of the targeted mutation. Tpst2-/- mice have moderately delayed growth but appear healthy and attain normal body weight by 10 weeks of age. In contrast to Tpst1-/- males that have normal fertility, Tpst2-/- males are infertile. Tpst2-/- sperm are normal in number, morphology, and motility in normal media and appear to capacitate and undergo acrosomal exocytosis normally. However, they are severely defective in their motility in viscous media and in their ability to fertilize zona pellucida-intact eggs. Adhesion of Tpst2-/- sperm to the egg plasma membrane is reduced compared with wild type sperm, but sperm-egg fusion is similar or even increased. These data strongly suggest that tyrosine sulfation of unidentified substrate(s) play a crucial role in these processes and document for the first time the critical importance of post-translational tyrosine sulfation in male fertility.

Tyrosine O-sulfation is a widespread post-translational modification that was first described about 50 years ago (1Bettelheim F.R. J. Am. Chem.

At this time, 37 tyrosine-sulfated proteins have been identified in humans, many of which play important roles in inflammation, hemostasis, immunity, and other processes (3Moore K.L. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, it is very likely that we are only beginning to appreciate the complexity of the TPST substrate repertoire. In mice and humans, tyrosine O-sulfation is mediated by one of two tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases, called TPST-1 and TPST-2, which are localized to the trans-Golgi network (7Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S.

Mouse TPST-1 and -2 are 370- and 376-residue type II transmembrane proteins, respectively. Each has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, followed by a single ∼17-residue transmembrane domain, a membrane-proximal ∼40-residue stem region, and a luminal catalytic domain containing four conserved cysteine residues and two N-glycosylation sites. The amino acid sequence of human and mouse TPST-1 are ∼96% identical, and human and mouse TPST-2 have a similar degree of identity. TPST-1 is ∼65-67% identical to TPST-2 in both humans and mice. Both isoenzymes are broadly expressed in human and murine tissues and cell lines and are co-expressed in most, if not all, cell types (3Moore K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24243-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, the relative abundance of the two proteins in tissues and cells is uncertain. The human TPST1 and TPST2 genes are on 7q11.21 and 22q12.1, respectively. The mouse Tpst1 and Tpst2 genes are ∼18.5 megabase pairs apart on chromosome 5. In vitro studies using synthetic peptide acceptors indicate that the two TPST isoenzymes differ in substrate preference. Peptides modeled on the N terminus of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 are sulfated by the two isoenzymes with equal efficiency. In contrast, peptides modeled on sulfation sites of human C4 α chain and heparin cofactor II are sulfated more efficiently by TPST-1 than by TPST-2 (8Ouyang Y.B. Moore K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24770-24774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Seibert et al. (10Seibert C. Cadene M. Sanfiz A. Chalt B.T. Sakmar T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They showed that TPST-1 preferred Tyr14 over Tyr15 as the initial sulfation site, whereas TPST-2 preferred Tyr15 over Tyr14. Nevertheless, it is not known if TPST-1 and -2 have distinct macromolecular substrate specificities in vivo. To gain an understanding of the biological role(s) of TPSTs, we generated TPST-deficient mice by targeted disruption of either the Tpst1 or Tpst2 gene. Previous studies of the Tpst1-/- mice (Tpst1tm1Klm, MGI: 2183366) revealed unexpected and pleiotropic effects, including modest effects on body weight and fecundity (11Ouyang Y.B. Crawley J.T.B.

Tpst1+/- mice appear normal and, when interbred, yield litters of normal size with a Mendelian distribution of the targeted mutation. A histological survey of the Tpst1 knock-out did not reveal any abnormalities. Northern analyses showed that disruption of the Tpst1 gene did not effect transcription of the Tpst2 gene. Tpst1-/- mice appear healthy but have ∼5% lower average body weight than wild type mice. Fertility of Tpst1-/- males and females per se was normal. However, Tpst1-/- females have smaller litters than wild type females due to fetal death between 8.5 and 15.5 days postcoitum. Here we describe the production and characterization of Tpst2 knock-out mice. In this study, we find that, in contrast to Tpst1-/- males, Tpst2-/- males are infertile. We find that Tpst2-/- males are eugonadal and have normal spermatogenesis. Epididymal sperm from Tpst2-/- males are normal in number, morphology, and motility and appear to capacitate in vitro and undergo acrosome exocytosis in response to agonist normally. However, they are severely defective in motility in viscous media and in their ability to fertilize ZP-intact eggs. In addition, in vitro fertilization (IVF) experiments designed to assess the gamete membrane interactions revealed that sperm from Tpst2 males have reduced ability to adhere to the egg plasma membrane but are able to undergo membrane fusion with the egg. Gene Targeting—Mouse genomic clones were identified and plaque-purified from a 129S6/SvEv spleen Lambda FIX II® genomic library (Stratagene) by high stringency hybridization with a full-length mouse TPST-2 cDNA probe. The organization of the Tpst2 gene was characterized by a combination of Southern blotting, restriction mapping, and sequencing. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences showed that most of the TPST-2 open reading frame is encoded by a 912-bp exon. This exon encodes the N-terminal 279 amino acids of the protein, including the 5′ PSB and 3′ PB motifs that are involved in binding the 5′ and 3′ phosphates of 3′,5′-ADP in the known sulfotransferase crystal structures (Fig. 1A) (12Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A targeting construct was designed to replace a 0.88-kb fragment spanning the start codon and the remainder of exon 3 by a 1.7-kb PGKneo cassette (Fig. 1B). A 4.5-kb EcoRI-ApaI genomic fragment was used as the left arm for homologous recombination and was cloned into the pPGKneo vector upstream of the PGKneo cassette. A 1.6-kb ApaI-BglII genomic fragment 3′ to exon 3 was cloned downstream of the PGKneo cassette as the right arm for homologous recombination. The construct was linearized with NotI and electroporated into AB2.2 embryonic stem cells (Lexicon Genetics, Inc.). After G418 selection, five positive clones were identified from 900 G418-resistant colonies by PCR screening. Clones were analyzed by Southern blotting to confirm the correct homologous recombination event, and random integration of extra copies of the targeting construct was excluded by hybridization with a neomycin probe (not shown). ES clones were injected into blastocysts, and the blastocysts implanted into pseudopregnant mice to generate chimeras. Male chimeras were mated with 129S6/SvEvTac females (Taconic Farms) to generate Tpst2+/- mice that were then interbred to generate Tpst2-/- mice. Genotyping was performed by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GAG GAC CTC ATT GGC AAG CCT-3′ and 5′-CAA CCT GGT GGA GTC GCT TCT CTC-3′ for the 520-bp fragment from the wild type allele and 5′-CCT CGT GCT TTA CGG TAT CGC CGC-3′ and 5′-CAA CCT GGT GGA GTC GCT TCT CTC-3′ for the 822-bp fragment from the mutant allele. All experiments reported here were performed on mice in the 129S6/SvEvTac background. Animals were mated, housed, and fed as previously described (11Ouyang Y.B. Crawley J.T.B. Aston C.E. Moore K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23781-23787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and all animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from tissues using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen), separated on 1% denatured gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For Northern blotting, a 489-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 958-1446 of the full-length cDNA was used as a probe. For Southern blotting, tail DNA was isolated (Qiagen genomic DNA kit), exhaustively digested with XbaI, separated on 1% agarose gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. A 469-bp TPST-2 DNA fragment downstream of the right arm was used as a probe. CHO-B (GenBank™ accession number L22552), a partial cDNA probe for ribosomal protein S2 from Chinese hamster, was used as a control probe (13Harpold M.M. Evans R.M. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1979; 17: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Blots were processed and imaged as previously described (11Ouyang Y.B. Crawley J.T.B. Aston C.E. Moore K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23781-23787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sulfotyrosine Analysis—Tissues were rinsed with PBS and cultured in sulfate-free Joklik modified Eagle's medium containing 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 0.15 mCi/ml carrier-free Na35SO4 at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. After 24 h, conditioned medium was collected, and the tissue explants were rinsed three times in PBS, solubilized in 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and the extracts were boiled for 5 min. Conditioned media and the SDS extracts were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min), proteins were precipitated with cold acetone, and the precipitates were washed three times with cold acetone and air-dried. These samples were hydrolyzed (0.2 m Ba(OH)2 in degassed H2O) for 18 h at 110 °C and then neutralized by the slow addition of H2SO4 using phenol red as an indicator, as previously described (14Huttner W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 200-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Neutralized hydrolysates were centrifuged (16,000 × g, 10 min), and supernatants were lyophilized. Samples were dissolved in 20 μl of electrophoresis buffer (5% formic acid, 15.6% glacial acetic acid, pH 1.9), spiked with 2 μg of unlabeled sulfoamino acid standards, spotted on cellulose plates (EMD Chemicals), and subjected to thin layer electrophoresis (600 V, 10 p.s.i., 2 h) using a Hunter TLE system (CBS Scientific, model HTLE-7000). After electrophoresis, standards were visualized by spraying the plates with 0.25% ninhydrin in acetone, followed by heating (100 °C, 5 min). The plates were exposed to preflashed BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and [35S]sulfotyrosine was quantitated using Image J software from a standard curve of serial dilutions of 35S standards spotted on the plates. Serum Assays—Serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level assays were performed by Anilytics, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). LH and FSH levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Testosterone levels were measured using the Coat-a-Count® total testosterone kit (Diagnostic Products Corp.). Analysis of Natural Matings—Superovulated 4-week-old FVB/N female mice (Charles River) were placed in cages pairwise with 10-12-week-old virgin wild type or Tpst2-/- males beginning at noon. The next morning females were checked for copulatory plugs. In one group of matings, plugs were removed from the females and washed in PBS, and the washings were examined microscopically for the presence of sperm. The uteri of the plugged females were then excised en block, the proximal end of the uterus was cannulated, and each horn of the uterus was separately inflated with ∼1 ml of PBS. The distal end of the uterine horn was transected to release the fluid, and the washings from each horn were pooled and examined microscopically for the presence of sperm. In a separate group of matings, egg clutches were recovered from the ampullae of the oviducts into M2 medium (Cell and Molecular Technologies) and incubated with 0.03% hyaluronidase to remove cumulus cells. A single observer blinded to the genotype of the animal counted and scored each egg as having been fertilized as indicated by the presence of a male pronucleus. Sperm Analysis—Male mice (10-12 weeks old) were anesthetized, and the cauda of the epididymis was removed and placed in a 35-mm Petri dish containing 0.5 ml of prewarmed HTF medium (100 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.2 mm MgSO4, 0.37 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2.78 mm glucose, 0.33 mm sodium pyruvate, and 21.4 mm sodium lactate, pH 7.4), a medium based on the composition of human tubal fluid (15Quinn P. Kerin J.F. Warnes G.M. Fertil. Steril. 1985; 44: 493-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sperm were released by slicing the epididymides several times with a 22-gauge needle. After a 5-min “swim-out” period, sperm-containing supernatant was collected, a sample was loaded on a hemacytometer, and the number of immotile sperm was counted. After this count, one-tenth volume of Kimura stain was added to another sample of the supernatant, and the total sperm count was determined. The percentage of motile sperm was then calculated as ((total - immotile)/total) × 100. A single observer blinded to the genotype of the animal performed all counts. An additional sample of the supernatant was fixed by the addition of an equal part of 8% paraformaldehyde in PBS and centrifuged at 20 × g for 1 min, and the pellet was resuspended in mounting medium and examined by phase-contrast imaging. For computer-assisted sperm analysis and IVF assay with cumulus-intact eggs, the epididymides and vas deferentia from each male were dissected into 1 ml of HTF medium containing 0.075% penicillin G, 0.05% streptomycin sulfate, 0.001% phenol red, 0.4% BSA; the pH was adjusted by gassing with 5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2 at 37 °C. Sperm were released by slicing the epididymides several times with a 30-gauge needle and by “walking” a pair of 30-gauge needles along the length of the vas deferentia to extrude the contents. The tissues were then allowed to stand for a 10-min swim-out period at 37 °C. Sperm samples were diluted 1:10 with a modification of Whittingham's PB1 medium (0.8% (w/v) NaCl, 0.02% KCl, 0.01% MgCl2, 0.01% CaCl2, 0.1% dextrose, 0.115% Na2HPO4, 0.0036% sodium pyruvate, 0.0075% penicillin G, 0.005% streptomycin sulfate, 0.3% BSA) and then loaded into cannulae and analyzed using an IVOS™ Sperm Analyzer (Hamilton Thorne Research). The following parameters were measured: mean straight line velocity (μm/s, straight line distance divided by time), mean curvilinear velocity (μm/s, total distance divided by time), linearity (distance in straight line divided by total distance), mean track width (μm, deviation of the head from the mean head trajectory), and beat cross frequency (Hz, the number of times the sperm head crosses the mean head trajectory/s). For analysis of sperm motility in viscous media, the epididymides and vas deferentia were removed and placed in 250 μl of capacitation media consisting of M199 with 0.4% BSA, (EquitechBio, Inc.), equilibrated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Sperm were released by slicing the tissue with a 22-gauge needle and incubated for 10 min to allow the sperm to swim out. The swim-out sperm were layered under 750 μl of M199-BSA in 12 × 75-mm culture tubes and incubated for 45 min to allow motile sperm to “swim up.” The upper 500-μl swim-up fraction was collected and incubated for an additional 60 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For observation of sperm in normal viscosity medium, a 40-μl drop of the swim-up sample in M199-BSA was placed in glass bottom culture dishes (Mat-Tek Corp.) on a heatable mounting frame held at 37 °C by a Tempcontrol 37-2 digital temperature controller (Carl Zeiss). For observation of sperm in viscous media, swim-up samples were injected under a drop of 2% long chain polyacrylamide (Scientific Polymer Products, Inc.) in M199-BSA equilibrated at 37 °C using a 25-gauge needle. Video images were acquired at 30 frames/s using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Hammamatsu) and a VHS recorder. For normal viscosity media, a 1-min recording of a single field was acquired, whereas for viscous media, two 1-min recordings of separate fields were acquired, and results from the two fields were averaged. Video images were analyzed off-line. The number of sperm that were inactive, active but with no forward velocity, or active with forward velocity were characterized as immotile, nonprogressive, and progressive, respectively. Sperm velocities were measured by tracking individual cells frame-by-frame using NanoTrack Software (Isee Imaging Systems). Capacitation—Extraction of cholesterol from sperm membranes during in vitro capacitation results in the redistribution of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts as assessed by immunofluorescence staining with cholera toxin β-subunit (CTβ) that binds ganglioside GM1 that is enriched in lipid rafts. CTβ staining is restricted to the equatorial segments and head cap on uncapacitated sperm. However, after capacitation, the toxin diffusely stains both the head and tail (16Roberts K.P. Wamstad J.A. Ensrud K.M. Hamilton D.W. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 572-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To assess sperm capacitation, sperm were incubated in M199 with or without 0.4% BSA at 37 °C. At various time points, sperm samples were diluted with one part of 10 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-CTβ (Sigma) in PBS, 0.1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature (16Roberts K.P. Wamstad J.A. Ensrud K.M. Hamilton D.W. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 572-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After washing, the stained sperm were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde, 10 min) and then mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). A total of 200 sperm were scored as being capacitated (green staining of sperm head and tail) or uncapacitated (green staining of sperm head only) by an observer blinded to the genotype of the sample. Acrosomal Exocytosis—Sperm were isolated as described above and were capacitated in M199-BSA for 2 h at 37°C. Calcium ionophore A23187 (50 μm) or diluent was added, and the sperm were incubated for an additional 1 h. Samples were fixed (70% ethanol, 10 min), air-dried onto glass slides, and then stained with 10 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Arachis hypogaea lectin (peanut agglutinin, Vector Laboratories) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, the slides were mounted in Vectashield containing 0.5 μg/ml propidium iodide. The samples were examined using an Olympus IMT-2 fluorescence microscope equipped with a dual band pass filter. Two hundred sperm were scored as being acrosome-intact (red nucleus with green acrosomal cap) or acrosome-reacted (red nucleus without green cap) by an observer blinded to the genotype of the sample. IVF of Cumulus-intact Eggs—Metaphase II-arrested eggs were collected from 23 ± 2-day-old superovulated CB6F1/J mice at 13 h after human chorionic gonadotropin injection. Females were sacrificed, and oviducts were dissected into HTF medium. Egg clutches (eggs and surrounding cumulus cell mass) were released by tearing the ampullae of the oviducts. IVF was carried out as described by Sztein et al. (17Sztein J.M. Farley J.S. Mobraaten L.E. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1774-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Eggs and 5 μl of sperm were added to a 250-μl drop of HTF in a Petri dish under light mineral oil (Sigma) at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2. After 4-5 h, eggs were washed by transfer through drops of fresh HTF and allowed to incubate overnight at 37 °C under the same atmosphere. The next morning, an observer blinded to the genotype of the animal scored the number of two-cell embryos. IVF of ZP-intact and ZP-free Eggs—Egg collection was performed as previously described (18McAvey B.A. Wortzman G.B. Williams C.J. Evans J.P. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 1342-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Metaphase II-arrested eggs were collected from 6-8-week-old superovulated CF-1 (Harlan) mice at 13 h after human chorionic gonadotropin injection. Cumulus cells were removed by brief incubation (<5 min) in Whitten's-HEPES medium containing 3% BSA (Albumax I; Invitrogen) and 0.02% Type IV-S hyaluronidase from bovine testis (Sigma). Eggs that were to be inseminated ZP-intact were cultured in Whitten's medium with 22 mm NaHCO3 (hereafter referred to as Whitten's) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum until the time of insemination to prevent premature ZP conversion (19Kalab P. Kopf G.S. Schultz R.M. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 45: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For eggs that were to be inseminated ZP-free, the ZP were removed after cumulus cell removal by a brief incubation (∼15 s) in acidic culture medium-compatible buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.4 mm KCl, 116.4 mm NaCl, pH 1.5). The eggs were then allowed to recover for 60 min in Whitten's, 1.5% BSA. All egg cultures were performed in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Caudal epididymal sperm were collected from Tpst2-/- mice or wild type control mice. The sperm from one epididymis were collected in 125 μl of Whitten's, 1.5% BSA. After 10-15 min, tissue was removed from the droplet, and the sperm were pipetted into the bottom of a tube containing 750 μl of Whitten's, 1.5% BSA. After 45 min, 225 μl from the top of the swim-up culture was removed and placed in a culture dish and covered with light mineral oil. The sperm were cultured for a total of 2.5-3 h in Whitten's, 1.5% BSA to allow the sperm to undergo capacitation and spontaneous acrosome exocytosis. IVF of ZP-intact and ZP-free eggs was performed essentially as described previously (18McAvey B.A. Wortzman G.B. Williams C.J. Evans J.P. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 1342-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Evans J.P. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3267-3278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following additions. ZP-intact eggs were washed through three drops of Whitten's, 1.5% BSA to wash away the fetal bovine serum and then inseminated with 250,000 sperm/ml for 3 h, with ∼25 eggs/100-μl drop. For IVF of ZP-free eggs to assess sperm-egg membrane interactions, 10 eggs/10-μl drop were inseminated for 1 h with 25,000 sperm/ml or 100,000 sperm/ml for sperm/egg ratios of 25:1 or 100:1, respectively. The eggs were washed through three drops of Whitten's, 1.5% BSA using a thin bore pipette to detach any loosely attached sperm. Eggs were then fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS and stained with 1.5 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole to assess the stage of maternal DNA and visualize decondensing sperm heads in the egg cytoplasm. For the assays using ZP-free eggs, data are expressed in terms of sperm bound (but not fused) per egg and sperm fused per egg. Statistical analysis of the data from these IVF experiments used nested analysis of variance in order to assess differences among the means of the various parameters examined (R statistics software). This analysis assesses the differences between individual mice as well as differences between the two genotypes. Characterization of Tpst2-/- Mice—To disrupt the Tpst2 gene, a targeting vector was constructed in which most of exon 3 of the Tpst2 gene was replaced with a PGKneo cassette (Fig. 1B). Linearized targeting vector was electroporated into ES cells that were then subjected to positive selection. Homologous recombinants were detected using PCR and confirmed by Southern analysis of XbaI-digested genomic DNA. ES cells were injected into blastocysts, and the blastocysts were implanted into pseudopregnant mice. Male chimeras were mated with 129S6/SvEvTac females and heterozygotes were crossed to generate Tpst2-/- mice. This targeted allele has been designated Tpst2tm1Klm (MGI:3512111). Transmission of the targeted mutation was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA (Fig. 1C). Functional inactivation of the Tpst2 gene was confirmed by Northern analysis of total RNA isolated from Tpst2+/+, Tpst2+/-, and Tpst2-/- organs (Fig. 1D, top). This showed a ∼50% reduction of full-length Tpst2 mRNA (∼1.8 kb) in lung and testes of Tpst2+/- mice. Transcripts were not detected in Tpst2-/- mice. To determine if disruption of the Tpst2 gene affected expression of the Tpst1 gene, the blots were stripped and reprobed with a TPST-1 probe (Fig. 1D, middle), and TPST-1 transcripts were quantified and normalized to CHO-B transcript levels (Fig. 1D, bottom). In the lungs of Tpst2+/+, Tpst2+/-, and Tpst2-/- mice, the ratios of TPST-1 to CHO-B mRNA were 0.055, 0.056, and 0.059, respectively. Likewise, in the testes of Tpst2+/+, Tpst2+/-, and Tpst2-/- mice, the ratios of TPST-1 to CHO-B mRNA were 0.41, 0.30, and 0.45, respectively. Thus, disruption of the Tpst2 gene had no detectable effect on expression of the Tpst1 gene in lung or testes. To determine the effect of disruption of the Tpst2 gene on protein-tyrosine sulfation, the amount of sulfotyrosine incorporated into proteins was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We observed that disruption of either the Tpst1 or Tpst2 gene resulted in a decrease in tyrosine sulfation of secreted (Fig. 2A) and cellular proteins (Fig. 2B) in spleen, epididymus, and thymus compared with wild type tissues. Growth and Development—Tpst2+/- mice appeared normal. The reproductive performance of Tpst2+/- mating pairs was normal (6.24 ± 2.20 pups/litter (mean ± S.D., n = 402)) when compared with that of wild type mating pairs (5.95 ± 2.12 pups/litter (mean ± S.D., n = 254)). The genotypes of offspring from Tpst2+/- × Tpst2+/- matings were consistent with Me"
https://openalex.org/W2030190241,"The receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is a conserved scaffold protein that helps regulate a range of cell activities including cell growth, shape, and protein translation. We report that a homologue of RACK1 is required for cytokinesis in pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei. The protein, referred to as TRACK, is comprised of WD repeat elements and can complement cpc2 null mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. TRACK is expressed throughout the trypanosome life cycle and is distributed predominantly in a perinuclear region and the cytoplasm but not along the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion, or cleavage furrow of dividing cells. When tetracycline-inducible RNA interference (RNAi) is used to deplete the cellular content of TRACK, the cells remain metabolically active, but growth is inhibited. In bloodstream forms, growth arrest is due to a delay in the onset of cytokinesis. By contrast, procyclic forms are able to initiate cytokinesis in the absence of TRACK but arrest midway through cell cleavage. The RNAi cells undergo multiple rounds of partial cytokinesis and accumulate nuclei and cytoplasmic extensions with attached flagella. The TRACK RNAi construct is also inducible within infected mice. Under these conditions parasites are eliminated from peripheral blood within 3 days post-infection. Taken as a whole, these data indicate that trypanosomes utilize a RACK1 homologue to regulate the final stages of mitosis. Moreover, disrupting the interaction between TRACK and its partners might be targeted in the design of novel therapies.

African trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that produce lethal infections in humans and livestock throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Trypanosomes have a complex life cycle that involves changes in morphology, biochemistry, and gene expression as the cells pass through a variety of different environments. Signal cascades are predicted to mediate complex life cycle events and initiate rapid changes in cell behavior. It is hypothesized that ablation of a signal or induction of an inappropriate signal will be lethal to these cells. From past experiments it is clear that trypanosomes have the potential to propagate signals involving Ca2+, cyclic nucleotides, eicosenoic acid, and phosphoryl transfer (1Parsons M. Ruben L.

However, in stark contrast with mammalian cells, where complex interacting signal networks have been described, a simple signal pathway has yet to be identified in Trypanosoma brucei. To remedy this situation we began to study a putative signal anchor protein and the pathways it regulates. In general, anchor proteins help provide spatial organization to the signal process by allowing the formation of multimeric complexes at the appropriate location in the cell (5Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).

In the case of trypanosomes, cryoelectron microscopy failed to identify RACK1 on the 40 S ribosome (24Gao H. Ayub M.J. Levin M.J. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10206-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that the trypanosome RACK1 (TRACK) functions in pathways other than translation. Sequences with similarities to RACK1 have recently been identified in Leishmania, Crithidia, and T. brucei (25Mougneau E. Altare F. Wakil A.E. Zheng S. Coppola T. Wang Z.E. Waldmann R. Locksley R.M. Glaichenhaus N. Science. 1995; 268: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 26Taladriz S. Gonzalez-Aseguinolaza G. Marquet A. Larraga V.

Murphy N.B. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In none of these cases is the function known. The RACK1-related protein in Leishmania is called LACK and was identified because of its ability to serve as a protective antigen during infection (25Mougneau E. Altare F. Wakil A.E. Zheng S. Coppola T. Wang Z.E. Waldmann R. Locksley R.M. Glaichenhaus N. Science. 1995; 268: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although its function is not understood, partial knock-out of the lack gene locus results in cells that divide normally but cannot efficiently parasitize host cells (29Kelly B.L. Stetson D.B. Locksley R.M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The trypanosome receptor for activated C kinase, or TRACK, was identified independently in two studies that evaluated differentially expressed genes. Rapidly dividing trypanosomes were found to have lower levels of track transcripts compared with G0-arrested stumpy forms (27Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or cells undergoing apoptosis-like death in response to concanavalin A (28Welburn S.C. Murphy N.B. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although TRACK and LACK have each been associated with cell growth and/or infectivity, the pathways they regulate are unknown. In the present study we evaluate for the first time the function of TRACK. We report that TRACK plays a fundamental role in trypanosome cytokinesis. A similar result had been reported for RACK1 in the early zygote stage of Caenorhabditis elegans (30Skop A.R. Liu H. Yates J. II I Meyer B.J. Heald R. Science. 2004; 305: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). When RNAi was used to knock down the C. elegans RACK1 homologue, the zygote initiated but failed to complete the first cytokinesis. Trypanosomes appear to lack some of the cell cycle checkpoints of other eukaryotes (31Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, TRACK RNAi in T. brucei produces cells that undergo multiple rounds of partial cytokinesis. These data indicate that trypanosomes initiate cytokinesis without TRACK, but require TRACK for progression beyond the midpoint of cell cleavage. Moreover, each of the partially cleaved daughter cells progresses through the cell cycle at different rates. Collectively, these data identify a new function for RACK1 homologues. Moreover, because TRACK mediates an essential process in trypanosomes, we propose that its association with target proteins may be disrupted in the design of new therapies. Trypanosomes—A PF cell line derived from AnTat1.1 bloodstream forms was kindly provided by E. Pays, Free University of Brussels. Additionally, 29-13 PF and 90-13 bloodstream form (BF) cells (32Wirtz E. Sl Leal Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by G. A. M. Cross, The Rockefeller University. Both the 29-13 cells and 90-13 cells express the T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor protein. PF cells were maintained in SDM-79 supplemented with 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 15 μg/ml G418 with 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin as needed. BF 90-13 cells were maintained in HMI-9 medium (33Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5 μg/ml hygromycin and 15 μg/ml G418. Where needed, 2.5 μg/ml of phleomycin was added. RNAi was induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Phylogenetic Analysis—BFs of pleiomorphic YTat1.1 and monomorphic M110 were obtained from rodent blood after DE-52 anion exchange chromatography, as described previously (34Ruben L. Ridgley E.L. Haghighat N.G. Chan E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Stumpy forms of YTat1.1 were obtained after inoculation of 1 × 104 BF cells into rats. Before the peak of parasitemia, cells were harvested by DE-52 anion exchange chromatography. Stumpy-form trypanosomes were transferred to Cunningham's medium and cultured at 28 °C until a stable culture of procyclic forms was obtained (34Ruben L. Ridgley E.L. Haghighat N.G. Chan E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Trypanosoma evansi, Trypanosoma equiperdum, and Trypanosoma cruzi cell homogenates were obtained as described previously (34Ruben L. Ridgley E.L. Haghighat N.G. Chan E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). track Clones—Genomic DNA was isolated from PF trypanosomes as described (35Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and used as a template to amplify track by PCR. Vectors include pQE30 (Qiagen), pTSA.Hyg (36Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), pLEW100 (32Wirtz E. Sl Leal Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), pALT4 (37McLeod M. Shor B. Caporaso A. Wang W. Chen H. Hu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4016-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and pZJM (38Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 211: 4998-5005Google Scholar). Forward primers for the complete coding region of track encompassed nucleotides 1-21, whereas the reverse primers encompassed nucleotides 933-953. The nucleotide sequence of track is at geneDB.org (Tb11.01.3170). Restriction sites were added to the primers. To express recombinant His6-TRACK, the complete coding region was cloned into the BamHI/HindIII site of pQE-30. TRACK.AU1 was cloned into the XhoI/BamHI site of pTSA.Hyg with the reverse primer encoding an AU1 epitope tag (39Traub-Cseko Y.M. Costa-Pinto D. McMahon-Pratt D. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 41-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length track was cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of yeast expression vector pALT4. A 503-bp fragment of the track coding region was amplified by PCR and cloned into the XhoI/HindIII sites between the dual opposed promoters in pZJM. The forward primer encompassed nucleotides 13-32 of the track coding region, and the reverse primer encompassed nucleotides 497-516. Transformation of Trypanosomes—The pZJM-TRACKi construct was linearized with NotI and electroporated into the 29-13 PF cell line or the 90-13 BF cell line. The pTSA construct was linearized with BssHII and electroporated into AnTat1.1. Electroporation was with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad).For BF cells, 100 μg of NotI-linearized pZJM.TRACK was added to 108 cells using the buffers and settings described (40Hammarton T.C. Lillico S.G. Welburn S.C. Mottram J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cloned cell populations were obtained by serial dilution. The phenotypes observed in this study were obtained with multiple cloned cell lines and with independent transformations. Growth Studies—Logarithmically growing cultures were diluted to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml (PF) or 1 × 105 cells/ml (BF). Cell density was determined by counting trypanosomes with a Neubauer hemocytometer at the times indicated. Each culture was counted in duplicate, and the growth study was repeated a minimum of three times. Protein Expression—Plasmid pDM31 encoding MalB.FLAG.RACK1 was kindly provided by D. Mochly-Rosen, Stanford University. Expressed protein was purified from soluble fractions on amylose-agarose following the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). To prepare antibodies against TRACK, recombinant His6-TRACK was purified from inclusion bodies after solubilization with 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 8 m urea, pH 8.0 (5 ml/g of wet weight). The sample was bound to nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, washed in the solubilization buffer adjusted to pH 6.3, and eluted in the same buffer at pH 5.9. Antibodies and Stains—To produce rabbit antibodies against recombinant TRACK, 2 mg of the purified protein was sent to Covance (Richmond, CA). Antiserum containing the IgG fraction was obtained by protein A chromatography. Other primary antibodies used in this study include mouse anti-AU1 (Covance; 1:200 dilution microscopy, 1:1000 dilution Western blots); rat anti-paraflagellar rod (T. Seebeck, University of Bern, 1:200 dilution); rat anti-glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (P. A. Michaels, Christian de Duve Institute of Cellular Pathology, Brussels, 1:1000 dilution); mouse E7 antibodies against β-tubulin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, 1:1000 dilution); mouse anti-tubulin (Sigma, 1:1000 dilution); rabbit anti-BiP (J. Bangs, University of Wisconsin, 1:200 dilution), rabbit anti-cytochrome C1, (S. Hajduk, Marine Biology Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA, 1:1000 dilution); mouse anti-phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, or phosphothreonine (Sigma, 1:1000 dilution). Secondary antibodies were purchased conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunolabs), Cy2 (Jackson Immunolabs), and Cy3 (Jackson Immunolabs). Stains include TOTO (Molecular Probes, 1:600 dilution); DAPI (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories), and MitoTracker (Molecular Probes, 200 nm). Immunoblots—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes using the BioRad semidry transfer apparatus for 15 min at 15 V. Color was developed with alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibodies and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate-p-toluidine salt (BCIP) and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT). Phosphoprotein blots were developed using the luminol/enhancer system (SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit, Pierce). Densitometry—Individual bands on immunoblots were assigned an integrated density value using the SpotDenso program on the Alpha Innotech Imaging system. Linearity of the integrated density value with increasing protein was verified. The ratio of the integrated density value for TRACK and its loading control (either tubulin or glyceraldehydes phosphate dehydrogenase) was calculated. Microscopy—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS with Dulbecco's salts; Invitrogen) and fixed for 45 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in the same buffer. After washing the cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, the cells were allowed to settle for 1 h on Fisher (+) Gold positively charged microscope slides. To quantify nuclei and kinetoplasts, cells were mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI, and at least 300 random cells were evaluated per experiment, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. For protein localizations the fixed cells were permeabilized on the slide with 0.1% Triton X-100 or 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) in PBS and blocked with 4% goat serum in PBS. Where indicated, MitoTracker (200 nm) was added to cells for 30 min before fixation. Primary antibody was added in the presence of 0.2% gelatin for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washes in PBS plus gelatin, cells were treated with secondary antibodies and TOTO as above and washed at least three more times. Cells were coated with Mounting Medium (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) or with Vectashield containing DAPI. Microscopy was with a Nikon C1 Digital Eclipse Confocal E600 microscope using either DIC optics, epifluorescence, or scanning lasers as indicated in each figure. Images were collected with Metamorph or EZ-C1 software (Nikon). TRACK Immunoprecipitations—Logarithmically growing wild-type PF cells were allowed to grow overnight to a density of 1.5 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were washed in PBS containing Dulbecco's salts and 1 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Cells were lysed at 2 × 106 cells/200 μl in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitor mixture comprised of leupeptin (5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), E64 (20 μm), and phosphatase inhibitors (0.2 mm orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, and 100 nm okadaic acid. The 10,000 × g supernatant was precleared with 1 volume of Sephadex G25 for 3 h at 4 °C. The pre-cleared supernatants were incubated with anti-TRACK and precipitated with protein A-agarose. Pellets were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blots. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were washed in PBS and suspended in 70% ethanol containing 5% glycerol. After an overnight incubation at -20 °C, cells were washed in PBS with Dulbecco's salts and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml RNase A. Propidium iodide was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. The cells were analyzed with the FACSCalibur cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Gating was determined with control cells for each experiment, and the same values were used for all treated cells. Cell cycle parameters were analyzed using ModFitLT Version 3.0. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Growth and Transformation—The S. pombe strain SPB190 (h90 leu1-32 ura4-D18 cpc2::ura4) was kindly provided by M. McLeod (State University of New York, Downtown Medical Center). Cells were grown in complex medium or YE (5 g of Difco yeast extract, 30 g of glucose, and amino acid supplements) for maintenance and unrestricted growth. Minimal medium was made by standard procedures (37McLeod M. Shor B. Caporaso A. Wang W. Chen H. Hu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4016-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and used for growth of auxotrophic mutants, selection of transformants, and complementation assays. Leucine (250 mg/liter) and adenine (3.75 g/liter) were added to auxotrophic strains as needed. All S. pombe strains were grown at 30 °C unless otherwise specified. Transformation of S. pombe was by electroporation. Briefly, 40 μl of cell suspension at 1 × 109 cells/ml in 1 m sorbitol was incubated with 100 ng of plasmid DNA on ice for 5 min. The pulse conditions were 1.5 kV, 25 microfarads and 200 ohms. Immediately after, 0.9 ml of ice-cold sorbitol was added to the cells, and they were plated onto minimal medium without any amino acid supplement. To test for expression of recombinant proteins, 2.3 mg of cell wet weight was suspended in 100 μl of distilled water to which an equal volume of 0.2 m NaOH was added for 5 min at room temperature as described (41Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Insoluble material was pelleted, and the supernatant was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer before analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Complementation Assays—S. pombe strain SPB190 or SPB190 containing pALT2, pALT4.TRACK, or pCPC1.10 was grown to stationary phase (108-109 cells/ml) in yeast extract plus 75 μg/ml adenine and then plated onto minimal medium and grown for 60 h at either 30 or 37 °C to test for recovery of morphology and viability at high temperature. TRACK Structure—Effective signals require correct distribution of regulatory proteins within the cell. Anchor proteins have been identified that serve as scaffolds upon which signal complexes can assemble (5Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 6McCahill A. Warwicker J. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). RACK1 has recently received attention because it forms productive ternary complexes with a wide range of partners (6McCahill A. Warwicker J. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In T. brucei, an apparent homologue of RACK1 has been cloned and is referred to as TRACK (27Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Welburn S.C. Murphy N.B. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Within the Sanger data base, track is identified as a tandemly repeated gene on chromosome 11 (www.geneDB.org). The genes are within a group that includes γ-tubulin-like interacting protein and Hsp70. TRACK is predicted to fold into a seven-bladed β-propeller comprised of WD repeat motifs (supplemental Fig. S1). Within the WD repeats, TRACK shares 64% identity with RACK1, falling to 34% identity in the loop regions. TRACK is also conserved in some of the regions known to interact with target proteins, including two protein kinase C interaction sites (the black box in supplemental Fig. S1) and one of two Ran kinase recognition sites, also referred to as Ran kinase domains (37McLeod M. Shor B. Caporaso A. Wang W. Chen H. Hu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4016-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Yeast Complementation—We tested the ability of track to complement a cpc2 null mutant cell line of the fission yeast S. pombe. RACK1 has already been shown to be a homologue of Cpc2 by this procedure (37McLeod M. Shor B. Caporaso A. Wang W. Chen H. Hu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4016-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, Cpc2 is not essential for normal growth on complete medium at 30 °C. However, in minimal medium cells accumulate in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and become elongated (Fig. 1A). Here, cpc2Δ cells are transformed with a variety of plasmids, including empty expression vector (pALT2), the cpc2 coding region in vector pALT4 (pCPC1.10), or with pALT4.TRACK. Western blots with anti-TRACK antibodies reveal cross-reacting proteins only in cells that express Cpc2 (cpc2Δ::pCPC1.10) or TRACK (cpc2Δ::pALT4.TRACK) (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Additionally, cells that express Cpc2 or TRACK have their morphology restored (Fig. 1A, lower panels), whereas cells that receive the empty vector remain elongated (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Growth of S. pombe, including cpc2Δ and all of the transformants, is equivalent in minimal medium at 30 °C (Fig. 1C). However, at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C, growth of cpc2Δ cells is greatly inhibited (Fig. 1C). The addition of an empty vector to these cells does not restore growth (upper right quadrant). However, the addition of track restores growth to the same extent as addition of yeast cpc2 (lower quadrants). The growth regulation involves association of Cpc2 with Ran1 kinase, and this requires phosphorylation of the Cpc2 Ran kinase domains (37McLeod M. Shor B. Caporaso A. Wang W. Chen H. Hu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4016-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In TRACK, only the Ran kinase domains in WD repeat 1 has a sequence that can be phosphorylated, whereas th"
https://openalex.org/W2169625731,"Membrane localization of lipidated cytosolic signaling proteins is mediated by interactions between specific lipid anchors and membranes, but little is known about the regulatory role of membrane composition in lipidated protein membrane targeting. Here, using green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras and quantitative fluorescence microscopy in living mouse colonocytes, we show that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) with membrane lipid-modifying properties, selectively inhibits plasma membrane (PM) targeting and increases the endomembrane localization of lipidated proteins that are cytoplasmic cargo in the exocytic pathway, without affecting the exocytic pathway itself. DHA selectivity seems to be dictated by the protein trafficking route, independent of the functional state of proteins and the location and composition of membrane anchors. DHA enrichment in cell membranes was required to elicit the inhibitory effect. These data reveal that membrane lipid composition influences cell signaling by modulating intracellular trafficking and localization of membrane proteins, providing a potential molecular mechanism for the documented health benefits of DHA."
https://openalex.org/W2129208664,"We examined the role of the cysteine string protein (Csp) in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) biogenesis in relation to another J-domain protein, Hdj-2, a recognized CFTR cochaperone. Increased expression of Csp produced a dose-dependent reduction in mature (band C) CFTR and an increase in immature (band B) CFTR. Exogenous expression of Hdj-2 also increased CFTR band B, but unlike Csp, Hdj-2 increased band C as well. The Csp-induced block of CFTR maturation required Hsp70, because a J-domain mutant (H43Q) that interferes with the ability of Csp to stimulate Hsp70 ATPase activity relieved the Csp-induced block of CFTR maturation. Nevertheless, Csp H43Q still increased immature CFTR. Csp-induced band B CFTR was found adjacent to the nucleus, co-localizing with calnexin, and it remained detergent-soluble. These data indicate that Csp did not block CFTR maturation by promoting the aggregation or degradation of immature CFTR. Csp knockdown by RNA interference produced a 5-fold increase in mature CFTR and augmented cAMP-stimulated CFTR currents. Thus, the production of mature CFTR is inversely related to the expression level of Csp. Both Csp and Hdj-2 associated with the CFTR R-domain in vitro, and Hdj-2 binding was displaced by Csp, suggesting common interaction sites. Combined expression of Csp and Hdj-2 mimicked the effect of Csp alone, a block of CFTR maturation. But together, Csp and Hdj-2 produced additive increases in CFTR band B, and this did not depend on their interactions with Hsp70, consistent with direct chaperone actions of these proteins. Like Hdj-2, Csp reduced the aggregation of NBD1 in vitro in the absence of Hsp70. Our data suggest that both Csp and Hdj-2 facilitate the biosynthesis of immature CFTR, acting as direct CFTR chaperones, but in addition, Csp is positioned later in the CFTR biogenesis cascade where it regulates the production of mature CFTR by limiting its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. We examined the role of the cysteine string protein (Csp) in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) biogenesis in relation to another J-domain protein, Hdj-2, a recognized CFTR cochaperone. Increased expression of Csp produced a dose-dependent reduction in mature (band C) CFTR and an increase in immature (band B) CFTR. Exogenous expression of Hdj-2 also increased CFTR band B, but unlike Csp, Hdj-2 increased band C as well. The Csp-induced block of CFTR maturation required Hsp70, because a J-domain mutant (H43Q) that interferes with the ability of Csp to stimulate Hsp70 ATPase activity relieved the Csp-induced block of CFTR maturation. Nevertheless, Csp H43Q still increased immature CFTR. Csp-induced band B CFTR was found adjacent to the nucleus, co-localizing with calnexin, and it remained detergent-soluble. These data indicate that Csp did not block CFTR maturation by promoting the aggregation or degradation of immature CFTR. Csp knockdown by RNA interference produced a 5-fold increase in mature CFTR and augmented cAMP-stimulated CFTR currents. Thus, the production of mature CFTR is inversely related to the expression level of Csp. Both Csp and Hdj-2 associated with the CFTR R-domain in vitro, and Hdj-2 binding was displaced by Csp, suggesting common interaction sites. Combined expression of Csp and Hdj-2 mimicked the effect of Csp alone, a block of CFTR maturation. But together, Csp and Hdj-2 produced additive increases in CFTR band B, and this did not depend on their interactions with Hsp70, consistent with direct chaperone actions of these proteins. Like Hdj-2, Csp reduced the aggregation of NBD1 in vitro in the absence of Hsp70. Our data suggest that both Csp and Hdj-2 facilitate the biosynthesis of immature CFTR, acting as direct CFTR chaperones, but in addition, Csp is positioned later in the CFTR biogenesis cascade where it regulates the production of mature CFTR by limiting its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum.

Mutations in the CFTR gene produce cystic fibrosis by reducing or eliminating this primary anion conductance pathway and the salt and water transport processes it underlies (1Pilewski J.M. Frizzell R.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S215-S255Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 2Boucher R.C. Eur. Respir. J. 2004; 23: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 3Nilius B. Droogmans G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 177: 119-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The most common CFTR mutation, ΔF508, results in biosynthetic arrest and ER-associated degradation of the mutant protein so that little, if any, ΔF508 CFTR progresses to the apical plasma membrane. Experimental rescue of ΔF508 CFTR by a variety of methods (4Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J.

Biol. 2004; 15: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) has demonstrated its partial functional competence, suggesting the potential value of therapies aimed at promoting the trafficking of CFTR processing mutants, like ΔF508, to the cell surface. Achieving this goal will be facilitated by an understanding of the chaperone and other protein interactions that regulate CFTR biogenesis. Early steps in this process are inefficient, leading to degradation of ∼70% of wild type (WT) CFTR in most cell types (7Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Qu B.H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Several of the protein components involved in the folding and domain assembly of native CFTR have been identified, including the molecular chaperones Hdj-2, Hsp70, Hsp90, and calnexin (9Yang Y. Janich S. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 10Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1492-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Their interactions are thought to facilitate CFTR folding; for example, Hsp70 and Hdj-2 interact with the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1, the site of the ΔF508 mutation) to inhibit its aggregation in vitro (12Meacham G.C. Lu Z. King S. Sorscher E. Tousson A. Cyr D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1492-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 13Strickland E. Qu B.H. Millen L. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25421-25424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Both Hsp70 and calnexin exhibit prolonged associations with ΔF508 CFTR relative to the wild type (WT) protein (9Yang Y. Janich S. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 10Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these chaperones are part of the quality control apparatus that identifies non-native CFTR conformations for degradation. A key component involved in removing CFTR from the productive folding pathway appears to be the ubiquitin ligase, CHIP, which poly-ubiquitinates Hsp70-ladened CFTR, thereby targeting the protein for proteasome-mediated degradation (14Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Similarly, calnexin undergoes transient cyclic associations with newly synthesized glycoproteins like CFTR to facilitate their folding, but components of this quality control cycle also can contribute to the ER retention and degradation of proteins whose native conformations are not achieved. Calnexin associates with both WT and ΔF508 CFTR during their biogenesis, but only the WT protein escapes the ER for Golgi-mediated glycosylation and apical membrane targeting (10Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biogenesis of a protein that assumes its native conformation with difficulty, like CFTR, represents the net result of the two opposing influences of molecular chaperones: facilitation of folding and targeting for degradation if folding does not succeed (15Younger J.M. Ren H.Y. Chen L. Fan C.Y. Fields A. Patterson C. Cyr D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Fewell S.W. Pipas J.M. Brodsky J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The co-translational association with CFTR of a DnaJ family co-chaperone, Hdj-2, represents a case in point. In combination with Hsp70, Hdj-2 is thought to play a significant role in the folding of NBD1 and its appropriate interaction with other CFTR domains, particularly the R-domain (12Meacham G.C. Lu Z. King S. Sorscher E. Tousson A. Cyr D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1492-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In contrast, prolonged or excessive interactions with Hsp70 and Hdj-2 can facilitate the efficient CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of CFTR (14Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). We have reported the interaction of CFTR with another J-domain protein, the cysteine string protein (Csp), and we found that the coexpression of Csp with CFTR reduced cAMP-stimulated CFTR currents (18Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F. Marino C.R. Lang J. Burgoyne R.D. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28948-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Ostensibly, this finding was compatible with the known action of Csp, identified originally as a synaptic vesicle-associated protein that plays an essential role in neurosecretory vesicle insertion into the plasma membrane (19Zinsmaier K.E. Eberle K.K. Buchner E. Walter N. Benzer S. Science. 1994; 263: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies of Csp demonstrated that it is required for other regulated exocytic processes, including insulin secretion (20Zhang H. Kelley W.L. Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Lang J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, although Csp localized partially to the apical membrane domain in polarized CFTR expressing epithelia, as expected for its participation in regulated exocytosis, its co-localization with calnexin also suggested the potential for Csp to function in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Further studies showed that the Csp-induced inhibition of CFTR currents was explained by a primary effect on the production of mature CFTR protein (18Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F. Marino C.R. Lang J. Burgoyne R.D. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28948-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), implying that Csp may also function at early steps in the protein secretory pathway. In this study, we examined the physiological role of Csp in CFTR protein processing by experimentally increasing or decreasing its expression level. The effects of varying Csp expression on CFTR biogenesis were compared with those of Hdj-2, an acknowledged CFTR co-chaperone (12Meacham G.C. Lu Z. King S. Sorscher E. Tousson A. Cyr D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1492-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the concept that these J-domain proteins play different roles in the processing of CFTR; Hdj-2 facilitates CFTR biogenesis, whereas Csp regulates the export of CFTR to post-ER compartments. Materials and Reagents—Wild type or mutant Csp constructs were tagged with the Myc epitope as described (20Zhang H. Kelley W.L. Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Lang J. J.

Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, and antibiotics (Invitrogen). For transient transfection of cDNAs encoding Myc-tagged Csp and CFTR, 106 cells per well in 6-well plates were plated and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 the following day according to the manufacturer's instructions and the methods described by Zhang et al. (18Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F. Marino C.R. Lang J. Burgoyne R.D. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28948-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Calu-3 cells were cultured as described (18Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F. Marino C.R. Lang J. Burgoyne R.D. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

Immunoblots and Pulse-Chase Assays—Transfected cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) by rocking for 30 min at 4 °C. To determine the distribution of CFTR between soluble and insoluble fractions, we used the following protocol. The Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was separated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was decanted, and the insoluble pellets were washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and re-solubilized in SDS-PAGE loading buffer by sonication. Crude membranes and membrane extracts from cell lines were prepared as described (18Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F. Marino C.R. Lang J. Burgoyne R.D. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, 50 μg of membrane extract per lane was separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were probed with the indicated antibodies and diluted as follows: anti-Csp, 1:2000; anti-Hsp70, 1:3000; anti-Hsp90, 1:2000; and anti-CFTR, 1:2000. Immunoblots were scanned and quantitated using ImageJ, a public domain Java image-processing program (downloaded from the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Statistics and t test calculations were done with Excel 2000 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation (IP) for detection of protein binding to CFTR were performed using methods described previously (9Yang Y. Janich S. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Immunofluorescence—Cells were replated on 12-mm poly-l-lysinecoated coverslips (BD Biosciences) in 24-well plates 1 day after transfection and then fixed and permeabilized on day 2. Antibody incubations were done in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% BSA, and all washes were done with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% BSA. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA), and nuclei were stained with the DNA dye Hoechst 33342 (bisbenzamide) purchased from Sigma. Images were obtained with an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope (see also Refs. 22Sun F. Hug M.J. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

Glutathione beads were incubated with 35S-labeled Csp or Hdj-2 at the indicated concentrations. After five washes with binding buffer, samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE; the signals were visualized by autoradiography. Co-IPs were performed using either 3 μl of anti-Csp or anti-CFTR (M3A7) antibody as described (18Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F. Marino C.R. Lang J. Burgoyne R.D. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

As a control for efficiency in the Csp/CFTR IPs, supernatant fractions obtained after IP of myc-Csp were incubated overnight with 3 μl of anti-CFTR (M3A7) antibody in the presence of protein G-agarose at 4 °C. The next day, samples were washed four times with DIGNAM-D buffer and separated by 5% SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed for CFTR (re-IP) using polyclonal anti-CFTR (R3195; 1:2000). RNA Interference—Six μg of dsRNA was transfected using 20 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 into 50% confluent 3T3 cells stably expressing CFTR (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Welsh, University of Iowa), which had been seeded onto 35-mm dishes 1 day earlier. Two and 4 days later, the transfections were repeated with the same procedure. Three days thereafter, cell lysates or membrane extracts were prepared and analyzed for CFTR, chaperone protein, and control protein expression, as described previously (18Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F.

Western blots were probed simultaneously with anti-Csp and anti-Hsp70 antibodies or with anti-CFTR and anti-Hsp90 antibodies. The blots were stripped and re-probed for tubulin as control. SPQ Assays of Regulated Anion Transport—Experimental procedures for monitoring forskolin-stimulated halide transport across the plasma membranes of HEK293 cells using SPQ fluorescence were performed as described (26Strong T.V. Wilkinson D.J. Mansoura M.K. Devor D.C. Henze K. Yang Y. Wilson J.M. Cohn J.A. Dawson D.C. Frizzell R.A. Collns F.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with modifications. HEK293 cells were seeded onto coverslips pre-coated with poly-l-lysine and cultured for 24-36 h. When cells reached ∼60% confluence, 1.5 μg of cDNA encoding human CFTR and/or wild type or mutant Csp was co-transfected using Lipofectamine, as described (18Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F. Marino C.R. Lang J. Burgoyne R.D. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28948-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After 1 day, the cells were loaded with SPQ using hypotonic loading conditions as follows. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in a 1:1 mixture of Cl- buffer (126 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% d-glucose, pH 7.2) and distilled H2O, containing 5 mm SPQ. After a 30-min recovery period in culture medium, the coverslips were then mounted in a chamber heated to 37 °C on the stage of a fluorescence microscope. The chamber was supplied continually with warmed buffer solution, and individual cells (regions of interest) were selected for study. Fluorescence intensity was collected as the perfused solutions were changed from sodium iodide to sodium nitrate to dequench SPQ fluorescence and expressed relative to intensity at time 0. Further fluorescence dequenching elicited by forskolin (10 μm) plus IBMX (100 μm) was indicative of cAMP-stimulated iodide efflux from preloaded cells and provides an assay for CFTR channel activity. Re-addition of iodide buffer then quenches SPQ fluorescence to base-line levels. Data were collected from at least 20 cells per coverslip, with images acquired at 0.2 Hz. The blank field obtained by closing the camera shutter was used as background and subtracted prior to image acquisition. Oocyte Expression—Oocyte preparation and cRNA injections were carried out essentially as described by Takahashi et al. (27Takahashi A. Watkins S.C. Howard M. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1887-C1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 1 ng of cRNA encoding CFTR with or without 100 ng of dsRNA targeting endogenous Xenopus Csp were injected, and expression was allowed to proceed for 4-5 days before current recordings. All data are provided as the mean ± S.E. Hsp70 ATPase Assays—The ability of WT or H43Q Csp to stimulate Hsp70 ATPase activity was determined as described previously (28Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D.

Briefly, Ssa1p-ATP complexes were formed as described (30Sullivan C.S. Tremblay J.D. Fewell S.W. Lewis J.A. Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) by incubating Ssa1p (25 μg) with 100 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 25 μm ATP in complex buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 11 mm magnesium acetate) for 30 min on ice. Free ATP was removed on a NICK spin column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with complex buffer. Using a Geiger counter, 15 fractions were collected (2 drops per fraction), and peak complex fractions were pooled, adjusted to 10% glycerol, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Single turnover ATPase assays were performed at 30 °C by mixing 25 μl of thawed Ssa1p-ATP complex and 25 μl of complex buffer with or without Csp or Csp H43Q. At specified time points, a 6-μl aliquot of the reaction was removed and added to 2 μl of stop solution (36 mm ATP, 2 m LiCl, 4 m formic acid) on ice. Triplicate 2-μl aliquots of this mixture were spotted onto a TLC plate, developed, and dried for PhosphorImager analysis. NBD1 Aggregation Assays—The chaperone function of Csp was assayed by its ability to prevent the aggregation of NBD1 (amino acids 404-644), as described previously for other CFTR chaperones (31Youker R.T. Walsh P. Beilharz T. Lithgow T. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 47878-47897Crossref Google Scholar). For the assay, purified hexahistidine-tagged NBD1 was diluted from a denaturing buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) into a refolding buffer (50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) to a final concentration of 2 μm. Protein aggregation was measured by light scattering as a function of time at a wavelength of 320 nm at 30 °C in a 14DS UV-visible IR spectrophotometer (Aviv Associates, Inc.) with and without Csp or Csp H43Q. The results were plotted as relative aggregation normalized to values at 10 min for NBD1 alone (13Strickland E. Qu B.H. Millen L. Thomas P.J. J. Biol.

Csp Block of CFTR Maturation Requires Hsp70—The influence of Csp expression on steady-state levels of CFTR was determined by cotransfection of HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding both proteins (Fig. 1A). As observed previously (18Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F. Marino C.R. Lang J. Burgoyne R.D. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28948-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), overexpression of Csp reduced the expression of mature, glycosylated (band C) CFTR and increased the expression of nascent, core glycosylated (band B) CFTR. This finding suggests that excess Csp interferes with the ability of CFTR to progress to Golgi-localized glycosylation sites. In our prior studies (18Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F. Marino C.R. Lang J. Burgoyne R.D. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28948-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), a block of CFTR maturation was observed with the co-expression of either Csp isoform, Csp1 or Csp2. The latter variant represents a C-terminal truncation of 31 amino acids from Csp1. It is expressed at lower levels than Csp1 (32Chamberlain L.H. Borgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

Therefore, we elected to focus the present studies on the predominantly expressed form, Csp1. We first examined several Csp mutations shown previously to interfere with regulated exocytic events (20Zhang H. Kelley W.L. Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Lang J. J.

As illustrated in Fig. 1A, the Csp HPD mutant, H43Q, restored the ability of CFTR to progress to Golgi glycosylation sites, as evidenced by the reappearance of CFTR band C.

https://openalex.org/W2055652435,"Adaptation of the halotolerant alga Dunaliella salina to iron deprivation involves extensive changes of chloroplast morphology, photosynthetic activities, and induction of a major 45-kDa chloroplast protein termed Tidi. Partial amino acid sequencing of proteolytic peptides suggested that Tidi resembles chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins which compose light-harvesting antenna complexes (LHC) (Varsano, T., Kaftan, D., and Pick, U. (2003) J. Plant Nutr. 26, 2197-2210). Here we show that Tidi shares the highest amino acid sequence similarity with light-harvesting I chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins from higher plants but has an extended proline-rich N-terminal domain. The accumulation of Tidi is reversed by iron supplementation, and its level is inversely correlated with photosystem I (PS-I) reaction center proteins. In native gel electrophoresis, Tidi co-migrates with enlarged PS-I-LHC-I super-complexes. Single particle electron microscopy analysis revealed that PS-I units from iron-deficient cells are larger (31 and 37 nm in diameter) than PS-I units from control cells (22 nm). The 77 K chlorophyll fluorescence emission spectra of isolated complexes suggest that the Tidi-LHC-I antenna are functionally coupled to the reaction centers of PS-I. These findings indicate that Tidi acts as an accessory antenna of PS-I. The enlargement of PS-I antenna in algae and in cyanobacteria under iron deprivation suggests a common limitation that requires rebalancing of the energy distribution between the two photosystems.

These findings indicate that Tidi acts as an accessory antenna of PS-I. The enlargement of PS-I antenna in algae and in cyanobacteria under iron deprivation suggests a common limitation that requires rebalancing of the energy distribution between the two photosystems. Iron is recognized as a major limiting element for photosynthesis, both in higher plants and in marine phytoplankton. Consequently, iron limitation can cause serious losses of agricultural productivity and affect oceanic carbon assimilation (1Watson A.J. Bakker D.C.E. Ridgwell A.J. Boyd P.W. Law C.S. Nature. 2000; 407: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 2Falkowski P.G. Barber R.T. Smetacek V.V. Science. 1998; 281: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). The photosynthetic apparatus represents one of the most iron-enriched cellular systems and therefore is highly vulnerable to iron limitation. Iron deficiency in photosynthetic organisms is manifested by the development of chlorosis (loss of chlorophyll), which is accompanied by loss of photosynthetic components and by inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport reactions (3Spiller S. Terry N. Plant Physiol. 1980; 65: 121-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies, mostly carried out in cyanobacteria and in algae, show that photosystem I (PS-I) 3The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; LHC, light-harvesting chlorophyll; BN, Blue Native; MS, mass spectrometry; CAB, Chl a/b-binding; Chl, chlorophyll; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DM, dodecyl maltoside; ELIPs, early light-induced proteins; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; RC, reaction center. is the primary target to be affected by iron limitation, probably because of its relatively high iron content (12-13 Fe/PS-I units). In cyanobacteria, iron deficiency induces a large drop in PS-I/PS-II units ratio (reviewed in Ref. 4Straus N. Iron Deprivation: Physiology and Gene Regulation.in: Bryant A.D. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1994Google Scholar) and the accumulation of a major chlorophyll a-binding protein, the isiA gene product CP43′ that forms an 18-subunit ring around the trimeric PS-I core. Spectroscopic evidence suggests that CP43′ is functionally coupled to PS-I reaction centers, indicating that it may act as a peripheral light-harvesting antenna (5Bibby T.S. Nield J. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43246-43252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Bibby T.S. Nield J. Barber J. Nature. 2001; 412: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, iron deprivation is associated with remodeling of PS-I, resulting in changes in the polypeptide composition of LHC-I and in a decreased efficiency of energy transfer between the light harvesting and reaction center (RC) (7Moseley J.L. Allinger T. Herzog S. Hoerth P. Wehinger E. Merchant S. Hippler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6709-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 8Naumann B. Stauber E.J. Busch A. Sommer F. Hippler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20431-20441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Changes in the structure and composition of PS-I under iron deprivation have been reported also in algae. In the green alga C. reinhardtii and in the red alga Rhodella violacea, iron deficiency induced uncoupling of the light-harvesting antenna, LHC-I, from PS-I reaction centers, as indicated by chlorophyll fluorescence emission measurements and by physical dissociation of PS-I units (7Moseley J.L. Allinger T. Herzog S. Hoerth P. Wehinger E. Merchant S. Hippler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6709-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 9Desquilbet T.E. Duval J.C. Robert B. Houmard J. Thomas J.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In C. reinhardtii, antenna proteins in the two photosystems appear to be differentially affected by iron deprivation, and although LHC-II overall abundance and composition remain fairly constant, LHC-I is down-regulated; Lhca3 undergoes N-terminal processing, and other LHC-I polypeptides are either increased or suppressed (8Naumann B. Stauber E.J. Busch A. Sommer F. Hippler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20431-20441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The observations that PS-I antenna are being modified under conditions of iron deprivation, which are associated with loss of chlorophyll and/or phycobiliproteins, are intriguing, and their significance is not clear. It has been proposed that the extra CP43′ may compensate for the decrease in light harvesting efficiency because of degradation of phycobiliproteins (10Kouril R. Arteni A.A. Lax J. Yeremenko N. D'Haene S. Rogner M. Matthijs H.C. Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3253-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CP43′ and the functional dissociation of LHC-I from RC-I in C. reinhardtii may dissipate excessive absorbed light to protect against photoinhibition (11Sandstorm S. Park Y.I. Oquist G. Gustafsson P. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In a previous work we reported that the halotolerant algae Dunaliella salina maintains photosynthetic activity and cell division even under extreme iron deprivation that causes extensive chlorosis, indicating that its photosynthetic system adapts well to conditions of iron limitation. We also reported the identification of an iron deficiency-induced thylakoid protein of 45 kDa (Tidi), which was tentatively identified as a chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (CAB) (12Varsano T. Kaftan D. Pick U. J. Plant Nutr. 2003; 26: 2197-2210Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this work we describe the cloning and characterization of Tidi, the first iron-regulated member of the CAB protein family that was cloned in eucaryotes. Tidi contains a unique proline-rich N-terminal domain, is associated with PS-I-LHC-I units, and based on chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics is energetically coupled to PS-I RCs. These findings, together with the reports from cyanobacteria and other algae, suggest that modulation of the outer antenna system around PS-I is an important step for the adaptation to iron deficiency. The possible physiological significance of LHC-I reorganization under iron deprivation will be discussed. Culture Growth and Chlorophyll Measurements—D. salina cells were cultured as described previously (13Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To induce iron deprivation, cells were pre-cultured for 48 h in complete growth media containing 1.5 μm iron/4 μm EDTA and next were transferred either for 48 h to fresh iron-deficient media or for 30 h to media containing 50 nm iron (mild iron depletion, 1:30 from standard conditions). For iron re-supplementation, cells were transferred to fresh growth medium containing 1.5 μm iron/4 μm EDTA. Starting cell concentrations were 105 or 5 × 105 cells/ml for iron deprivation or re-supplementation, respectively. Chlorophyll contents were determined according to Arnon (14Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low temperature (77 K) chlorophyll fluorescence emission was measured in an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter (SLM-Aminco-Chance, Urbana, IL) equipped with a low temperature attachment (12Varsano T. Kaftan D. Pick U. J. Plant Nutr. 2003; 26: 2197-2210Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis and Antibodies—Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay kit (BCA-1, Sigma). Analysis of proteins on SDS-PAGE was according to Fisher et al. (15Fisher M. Pick U. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1359-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein extraction in phenol and analysis by isoelectric focusing two-dimensional PAGE was according to Liska et al. (16Liska A.J. Shevchenko A. Pick U. Katz A. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2806-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of Tidi by V8 protease and separation of peptides was as described previously (17Sekler I. Weiss M. Pick U. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis of protein samples was performed at the mass spectrometry service units at the Hebrew University in Israel. Polyclonal antibodies against Tidi protein were prepared in rabbits by excising the protein band from polyacrylamide gels and mixing with Freund's adjuvant. Antibodies against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled synthetic peptide P31 (PEPKKGSAFKGY, amino acids 88-99; see Fig. 4) were prepared similarly and subsequently purified on a Sepharose-P31 affinity column. Antibodies against PsaD, PsaE, PsaF, PsaG, PsaH, and ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase were a gift from Prof. Rachel Nechushtai at the Hebrew University in Israel. Antibodies against D1 and PsaA/B were a gift from Prof. Meir Edelman at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. Antibodies against light-harvesting proteins Lhca3, 17.2, and LHC-II were a gift from Prof. Michael Hippler at the Friedrich-Schiller University of Jena, Germany. Immunolocalization was done according to Ref. 15Fisher M. Pick U. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1359-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Preparation of Thylakoid Membranes from D. salina—Cultures containing 2-3 × 106 cell/ml were filtered through Miracloth®, and cells were washed and osmotically lysed essentially as described earlier (18Katz A. Kaback H.R. Avron M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 202: 141-144Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in an isoosmotic glycerol buffer and osmotically lysed by a 3-fold dilution. Thylakoid membranes were collected by centrifugation (15 min at 4,000 × g at 4 °C) and further purified by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 20 min 4 °C) on a 0-25% Percoll gradient in suspension buffer (0.4 m glycerol, 10 mm Tris-MOPS, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 plus protease inhibitors). The upper green band was collected and washed twice with glycerol buffer, and aliquots were stored in liquid nitrogen until further use. Cloning and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from 5 × 108 cell samples, harvested 38 h after transfer to iron-depleted medium, with the RNeasy maxi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using the poly(A)+ tract mRNA isolation kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Synthesis of cDNA using 4 μg of mRNA was with the thermostable avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Sigma). The cDNA was used as template in PCR performed with degenerate primers designed from peptide sequences (5′-sense GGC AAG GCY GGN GTN ATH CC; 5′-antisense AC GGA GCC GGG YTC CTT RTA YTC YTG). Specific products were enriched using a second PCR with nested primers. PCR products were extracted from the gel by GenElute™-agarose spin column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), subcloned into pTZ57R vector using the InsT/Aclone™ PCR product cloning kit (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), and sequenced. Specific primers were synthesized from the positive clone and used in 3′- and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends reactions using the Smart™ rapid amplification of cDNA ends cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). Northern blot analysis was done according to Schwarz et al. (19Schwarz M. Sal-Man N. Zamir A. Pick U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1649: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) using an 813-bp probe from the 5′ end of Tidi cDNA, which was labeled using the random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Separation of Protein Complexes by Blue Native (BN)-PAGE—Separation of thylakoid membrane complexes was according to Kugler et al. (20Kugler M. Jansch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 53: 35-44Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Protein samples of the thylakoid membrane fraction (1200 μg of protein) were pelleted and resuspended in 500 μl of BN buffer (25 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml DNase I, and protease inhibitors as above). After 30 min of incubation at 4 °C, membranes were pelleted and subsequently solubilized in 0.1 μl of BN buffer supplemented with 4% DM. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, and unsolubilized material was precipitated (100,000 × g, 20 min at 4 °C). Ten microliters of 10× concentrated BN solubilization buffer (5% Serva Blue G, 100 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 0.5 m aminocaproic acid, 30% sucrose) were added to 90 ml of solubilized samples and after 5 min loaded on BN-polyacrylamide gels. Complexes were separated at 4 °C, at 5 mA constant current (with maximum 200 V) for 6 h. Second dimension separation on SDS-PAGE was according to Ref. 21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar. Protein complexes were electro-eluted from BN gels using GeBAflex-tube (GeBA, Kfar-Hanagid, Israel) in Elution buffer (25 mm Na-Tricine, 7.5 mm BisTris, 10% glycerol, 0.001% Serva Blue G, and 0.03% DM), at a constant current of 10 mA for 6 h at 4°C. Protein complexes were concentrated in Centricon® YM-100 (Centricon HR, Houston, TX). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Concentrated D. salina cells were frozen in cellulose capillary tubes (inner diameter, 200 μm), sandwiched between 100-μm-spaced aluminum platelets, in a Bal-Tec (Bal-Tec, Balzers, Liechtenstein) HPM-10 high pressure freezing machine (22Hohenberg H. Mannweiler K. Muller M. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1994; 175: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The frozen samples were freeze-substituted utilizing an automatic freeze substitution system device (Leica, Lienz, Austria) in anhydrous acetone containing 0.01% glutaraldehyde + 0.2% uranyl acetate at -90 °C for 3 days, after which the temperature was raised to -30 °C during 24 h, washed twice with anhydrous ethanol, and infiltrated for 7 days in a series of increasing concentration of Lowicryl HM-20 in ethanol as follows: 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80% and six exchanges of pure resin (adopted from Ref. 23Humbel B.M. Konomi M. Takagi T. Kamasawa N. Ishijima S.A. Osumi M. Yeast. 2001; 18: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Samples were UV-polymerized, and thin sections were obtained using a Leica Ultracut microtome (Lienz, Austria). Sections were incubated for 30 min in a blocking solution (0.5% gelatin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% glycine, 1% Tween 20 in PBS) and transferred for a 2-h incubation in rabbit antibodies against Tidi diluted 1:30 with the same blocking solution containing 1% normal goat serum. The sections were then washed with 0.2% glycine in PBS, incubated for 5 min in blocking solution, and transferred for incubation with mouse anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to colloidal gold particles. After two washes with 0.2% glycine in PBS followed by two washes in double distilled water, sections were stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by Raynold's lead citrate. Sections were observed in a Tecnai T-12 (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), and images were recorded using a MegaView III CCD camera (SIS, Gröbenzell, Germany). Single Particle Electron Microscopy—Suspensions of solubilized PS-I particles in elution buffer were prepared for EM using the droplet method. Samples (containing about 0.8 mg of Chl/ml) were applied to glow-discharged, carbon-coated electron microscope grids for 1 min, washed once with washing buffer (25 mm Na-Tricine, 7.5 mm BisTris, pH 7.0), and stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min. Grids were examined on a Tecnai F20 electron microscope equipped with a field emission gun at 200 kV. Images were collected on a TVIPS TemCam CCD camera (1,024 × 1,024 pixels) at nominal pixel size of 0.32 nm, with defocus values between 0.8 and 2.0 μm. Particles were picked from images using the “Boxer” routine contained in the “EMAN” program (24Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). A total number of 2,372 and 1,822 particles of PS-I-LHC-I were chosen for analysis from control (complex 3) and from iron-deficient cells (complex e), respectively. Particles were classified using the k means algorithm within EMAN, after low pass filtration to 2.5 nm. Cross-correlations between individual classes were calculated with SPIDER (25Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y.H. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Tidi Is Localized in Thylakoid Membranes and Is Resolved into Five Components on Two-dimensional Gels—In a previous study we reported that iron deficiency induces the accumulation of a 45-kDa protein in a thylakoid-enriched preparation from D. salina. Based on a partial amino acid sequence homology of two proteolytic fragments, obtained by Edman degradation, we proposed that the protein is a chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (12Varsano T. Kaftan D. Pick U. J. Plant Nutr. 2003; 26: 2197-2210Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To validate this observation, purified thylakoid membranes were prepared from iron-deprived and from iron-sufficient D. salina cells, and their protein composition was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The analysis revealed a very similar pattern of proteins except for the appearance of five distinct spots of about 45 kDa, with isoelectric points 5-6, in thylakoids from iron-deficient cells (Fig. 1). To clarify whether these spots represent the same protein, spots 1-5 were cleaved with V8 protease, resulting in a practically identical peptide fragmentation pattern on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Analysis of a tryptic digest of spots 2 and 3 by mass spectrometry (MS) shows a very similar peptide composition (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that components 1-5 represent the same 45-kDa protein. The protein was termed Tidi, for thylakoid iron deficiency-induced protein. The differences between spots 1 and 5 are not clear. Comparisons of the MS/MS data indicate that they do not result from carbamylation of lysine or arginine side chains. Differential phosphorylation can also be ruled out, because Tidi is not labeled with 32P and does not cross-react with antibodies against phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phospho-tyrosine (data not shown). They may result either from a different post-translational modification or from alternative processing of N- or C-terminal charged amino acids as demonstrated for Lhcb proteins of C. reinhardtti (26Stauber E.J. Fink A. Markert C. Krause O. Johnningmeier U. Hippler M. Eukaryot. Cells. 2003; 2: 978-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against purified Tidi were raised in rabbits and utilized for immunocytochemical localization of Tidi in intact cells. Tidi was found to co-localize with the Chl fluorescence in iron-deficient cells, confirming the exclusive localization in thylakoid membranes (confocal microscopy; data not shown). Electron micrographs of immunogold-labeled cell slices revealed that Tidi appears in small clusters between stacked thylakoids at the early stages of iron deprivation (Fig. 3). These results verify that Tidi is confined to chloroplast thylakoids.FIGURE 2Comparison of proteolytic products of Tidi spots 1-5 by SDS-PAGE and by mass spectrometry. A, the two-dimensional gel spots (Fig. 1, 1-5) were excised from the gel and separately digested in-gel by V8 protease (1 mg). Peptides were separated on a 10-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

Kaftan D. Pick U. J. Plant Nutr. 2003; 26: 2197-2210Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), to design degenerate primers, and by using PCR we amplified a DNA fragment from the cDNA of iron-deficient cells. The full-length cDNA was obtained by 5′ and 3′ amplification of cDNA ends (GenBank™ accession number AY965258). The 1,556-bp transcript contained a 1,050-bp open reading frame, encoding a 350-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of about 38 kDa. The open reading frame is flanked by a 102-bp 5′-untranslated region and a 404-bp 3′-untranslated region including a polyadenylation site (TGTAA) 13 bp upstream from the poly(A) tail. Six peptide sequences, obtained either by N-terminal Edman degradation or by MS analysis of tryptic fragments, covering 28% of the putative protein sequence, were identified within the open reading frame. The predicted amino acid sequence of Tidi includes the conserved domain of CAB proteins (amino acids 127-323). The best six hits in a BLAST search were LHC-I, type III, and CAB proteins from various higher plants, with a maximum of 53% identity and 68% similarity. Most surprisingly, CAB proteins from C. reinhardtti, a closely related green alga, show significantly lower sequence homology with Tidi (Fig. 4). Tidi differs from other LHC-I proteins in the extended N-terminal domain of 126 amino acids. The N-terminal domain of Tidi is unusual not only in its length but also in the high abundance of prolines (23% of the first 90 amino acids), bordered mostly by basic amino acids. This domain does not resemble any CAB or other known protein sequences in the protein data bases. The 30 first N-terminal amino acids have a predicted structure resembling plant transit peptides, a random coil followed by a helix (not shown). The N-terminal amino acid of the mature protein could not be determined experimentally, because it turned out to be chemically modified, but the theoretically predicted cleavage site may be either after amino acid 31 or 33 (programs MitoProII or SignalP, respectively). These results demonstrate that Tidi is a chlorophyll a/b-binding protein homolog, which contains an unusual N-terminal domain that is preceded by a signal peptide. Transcriptional Analysis and Stress Specificity—We compared the time courses of Tidi transcript and protein accumulation following iron deprivation by Northern blot and by Western blot analyses, respectively (Fig. 5). The comparison showed that the transcript of Tidi precedes the accumulation of the protein and peaks 24 h after the onset of iron depletion and decreases thereafter. Twenty four hours following iron re-supplementation, Tidi transcript completely disappears, and the protein level markedly decreases mostly because of dilution (5-7-fold increase in cell number). These results suggest that Tidi is regulated mainly at the mRNA level. To check if Tidi is specifically induced by iron deficiency or is a general stress protein, polyclonal antibodies were utilized to test its accumulation under different stress conditions by Western analysis. We found that high light, low temperature, high salinity (3 m NaCl), oxidative stress (methyl viologen, H2O2), or deficiency of other nutrients did not induce the accumulation of Tidi (not shown), indicating that it is a specific response to iron stress. Induction of Tidi Is Correlated with a Decrease in PS-I RC Proteins—To test if the induction of Tidi is interrelated with other changes in the chloroplast, we compared its accumulation with the levels of other chloroplast proteins. As reported previously (12Varsano T. Kaftan D. Pick U. J. Plant Nutr. 2003; 26: 2197-2210Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), iron deprivation does not inhibit cell division within 72 h, but it induces a remarkable shrinkage of the chloroplast and in parallel suppresses the Chl level, reaching about 80% inhibition after 72 h (Fig. 6B, I and II). We found that irrespective of the large drop in Chl, the ratio of Chl per protein in thylakoids, isolated from iron-sufficient or iron-deprived cells, remains fairy constant (1:6-1:8; data not shown). Therefore, the Chl level can be taken as a representative basis for quantitation of thylakoid proteins during progressive iron deprivation. A quantitative immunoblot analysis shows that the Tidi/Chl ratio rapidly increased (within 36 h) or decreased (within 24 h) following iron depletion or re-supplementation, respectively. In parallel with the induction of Tidi, we observed a large decrease in PsaA/B, PsaG (not shown), and PsaD subunits of PS-I RC, which was reversed by iron supplementation. In contrast, the relative abundances of LHC-I (represented by Lhca3) as well as LHC-II CAB proteins per Chl did not decrease during iron deficiency (Fig. 6, A and B). These results suggest the induction of Tidi is correlated with a decrease in number of PS-I units, which precede the decrease in Chl synthesis, consistent with reorganization of PS-I under iron deficiency. Association of Tidi with PS-I—To find out if Tidi is associated with PS-I or with PS-II units, we solubilized thylakoid membranes in DM and resolved protein complexes by BN-PAGE. In membranes from iron-sufficient cells, eight major Chl-containing bands ranging in size from 150 to 700 kDa could be identified (Fig. 7A). Resolution of these bands on a second SDS gel revealed that each band represents distinct protein complexes (Fig. 7B). Western immunoblot, combined with MS analyses, identified bands 1 and 2 (red, 700-750 kDa) as PS-II-LHC-II complexes and bands 3 and 5 (blue, 500-600 kDa) as PS-I-LHC-I complexes (Fig. 7C). Band 6 (∼380 kDa) represents free PS-II reaction centers, whereas band 7 represents free LHC-II monomers. In iron-deficient cells, significant changes were observed in the PS-I but not in PS-II protein complexes, in comparison to the iron-sufficient cells. Although bands 3 and 5 were substantially reduced, larger new complexes (α-ϵ) appeared (Fig. 7, A and B). Analysis of the protein composition of these new complexes revealed"
https://openalex.org/W2028545443,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency has been associated with a variety of human cancers. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) is one of the key viral proteins required for transformation of primary B cells in vitro and establishment of EBV latency. We have previously shown that LMP-1 induces the expression of several interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes and has antiviral effect (Zhang, J., Das, S. C., Kotalik, C., Pattnaik, A. K., and Zhang, L. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 46335–46342). In this report, a novel mechanism related to the antiviral effect of LMP-1 is identified. We show that EBV type III latency cells, in which LMP-1 is expressed, are primed to produce robust levels of endogenous IFNs upon infection of Sendai virus. The priming action is due to the expression of LMP-1 but not EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2). The signaling events from the C-terminal activator regions of LMP-1 are essential to prime cells for high IFN production. LMP-1-mediated activation of NF-κB is apparently necessary and sufficient for LMP-1-mediated priming effect in DG75 cells, a human B cell line. IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) that can be activated by LMP-1 is also implicated in the priming action. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that LMP-1 may prime EBV latency cells for IFN production and that the antiviral property of LMP-1 may be an intrinsic part of EBV latency program, which may assist the establishment and/or maintenance of viral latency.

Also, EBV infection is associated with the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) (1Rickinson A.B. Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippinscott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2397-2446Google Scholar, 2Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippinscott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2343-2396Google Scholar). The biologic hallmark of EBV-cell interaction is latency. Three types of latency have been described, each having its own distinct pattern of gene expression. Type I latency is exemplified by BL tumors in vivo. EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) protein is expressed in this form of latency. Type II latency is exemplified by nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin disease. EBNA-1, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1), and LMP2A and LMP2B proteins are expressed in type II latency. Type III latency is represented by lymphoblastoid cell lines. Nine viral proteins are expressed, including six nuclear proteins (EBNA-1, EBNA-2, EBNA-3A, EBNA-3B, EBNA-3C, and EBNA-LP) and three integral membrane proteins (LMP-1, LMP-2A, and LMP-2B) (reviewed in Refs. 1Rickinson A.B.

Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippinscott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2343-2396Google Scholar). EBV LMP-1 is the principal oncoprotein required for EBV transformation of human B cells and establishment of latency in vitro. LMP-1 is an integral membrane protein with six transmembrane-spanning domains with a long C-terminal domain, which is located in the cytoplasm (2Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippinscott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2343-2396Google Scholar, 3Liebowitz D. Wang D. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 233-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two C-terminal activator regions (CTARs) have been identified to initiate signal transduction. LMP-1 acts as a constitutively active receptor-like molecule that does not need the binding of a ligand (4Gires O. Zimber-Strobl U. Gonnella R. Ueffing M. Marschall G. Zeidler R. Pich D. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6131-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). LMP-1 appears to be a central effector of altered cell growth, survival, adhesive, invasive, and antiviral potential (5Miller W.E. Earp H.S. Raab-Traub N. J.

A. 1998; 95: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Type I interferons (IFNs) are cytokines with many functions including antiviral and anti-proliferation (10Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar, 11Sen G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). IFNs are produced upon the infection of cells by viruses. There are a large number of type I IFN genes in the human: 13 IFN-α genes, 1 IFN-β gene, and 1 IFN-ω gene (12Roberts R.M. Liu L. Guo Q. Leaman D. Bixby J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is not known now why there are so many type I IFN genes. However, a unique role for IFN-β for a fully effective antiviral response, which cannot be compensated by IFN-α, has been documented (13Deonarain R. Alcami A. Alexiou M. Dallman M.J. Gewert D.R. Porter A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3404-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The amount of IFNs produced by viruses or double-stranded RNA can be increased robustly by treating cells with IFN before infection, a phenomenon known as IFN priming (14Stewart II, W.E. Gosser L.B. Lockart Jr., R.Z. J. Virol. 1971; 7: 792-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fujita T. Saito S. Kohno S. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 45: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Havell E.A. Vilcek J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 2: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The stimulation of IFN production observed upon priming results from an increase in the rate of IFN gene transcription and requires an IFN-inducible factor(s) (17Enoch T. Zinn K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18Nir U. Cohen B. Chen L. Revel M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6979-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the transcriptional activation of IFNs has been under intensive investigation. One of the major players in the IFN production is IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7). IRF-7 was cloned in the context of EBV latency and has an intimate relation with EBV (19Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 20Zhang L.

IRF-7 is inducible by type I IFNs and can be further activated by phosphorylation and nuclear translocation upon viral infection, and activated IRF-7 is partially responsible for the robust transcriptional activation of IFNs (23Zhang L.

Previously, we have shown that LMP-1 induces several antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) without triggering IFN production and that LMP-1 possesses antiviral activity (30Zhang J. Das S.C.

In this report, we extend our earlier discovery and show that EBV latency cells have enhanced ability to produce IFN upon viral superinfection. We further show that LMP-1 primes EBV latency cells for IFN production, similar to IFN primed cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report that a viral latent gene primes cells for IFN production. Plasmids, Antibodies, and Viruses—Expression plasmids of LMP-1 and its signaling-defective mutant, LMP-DM, as well as IRF-7 and its DNA-binding mutant, IRF7-K92E, were described previously (24Zhang L. Wu L.H. Hong K. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12393-12401Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Zhang J. Wang J. Wood C. Xu D. Zhang L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5640-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression plasmid of EBNA-2 (pAG155) was a gift from Dr. Paul Ling. NF-κB-related plasmids p65 and p50, IκB expression plasmids, plus NF-κB reporter construct were gifts from Dr. Albert Baldwin. EBNA-2 antibody (PE2) and LMP-1 antibody (CS1–4) were purchased from Dako. STAT-1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Tubulin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-Sendai virus antibody was purchased from U. S. Biological. Recombinant human IFN-α was purchased from Schering-Plough. Sendai virus stock was purchased from Spafas, Inc. For virus infection, 200 HA units/ml Sendai virus were added to the target cells for 6 h, and cells were then collected for RNA isolation. However, 7-h infection was used for examining the endogenous IFN production in the media. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Isolation of Transfected Cells—DG75 is an EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (32Ben-Bassat H. Goldblum N. Mitrani S. Goldblum T. Yoffey J.M. Cohen M.M. Bentwith Z. Ramot B. Klein E. Klein G. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 19: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). BL41 is an EBV-negative BL line, and BL41-EBV was generated by in vitro infection of BL41 with EBV B95-8 strain (33Calender A. Billaud M. Aubry J.P. Banchereau J. Vuillaume M. Lenoir G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8060-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Sav I and Sav III are genetically identical cell lines that differ only in their latency types (34Nonkwelo C. Skinner J. Bell A. Rickinson A. Sample J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 623-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Akata (type I) and IB4 (Type III) are EBV-positive cell lines. These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 293 cells are human fibroblasts and are maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FBS. Electroporation (320 V; 925 microfarads) was used for transfection of the B cells as described previously (20Zhang L. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5748-5757Google Scholar, 21Zhang L. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Zhang L. Wu L.H. Hong K. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12393-12401Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A total 10 μg of DNA was used for transfection of DG75 cells. 1 μg of LMP-1-expression plasmids were always used in transfection because similar LMP-1 expression levels in transfected and EBV type III latency cells could be achieved under such conditions. Enrichment for CD-4-positive cells was performed with the use of anti-CD-4-antibody conjugated to magnetic beads according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Dynal, Inc.). DG75 cells were transfected with CD-4 expression and other plasmids. One day after the transfection, the cells were used for isolation of CD-4-positive cells with the use of Dynabeads CD4 (Dynal Inc.) The transfected cells were incubated with Dynabeads-CD4 at 72 μl of beads/107 cells for 20–30 min at 4 °C with gentle rotation. CD4-positive cells were isolated by placing the test tubes in a magnetic separation device (Dynal magnet). The supernatant was discarded while the CD4-positive cells were attached to the wall of the test tube. The CD4-positive cells were washed 4–5 times in phosphate-buffered saline plus 2% FBS and resuspended in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 plus 1% FBS. Cells were detached from the Dynabeads CD4 by incubating for 45–60 min at room temperature with 10 μl of DETACHaBEAD (Dynal). The detached beads were removed by using the magnet separation device. The released cells were washed 2–3 times with 500 μl of RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS and resuspended in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS at 5 × 105 cells/ml. The isolated cells were used to extract total RNAs or prepare cell lysates immediately or recovered overnight before infection by viruses. Western Blot Analysis with Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL)—Separation of proteins on SDS-PAGE was carried out following standard protocol. After the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose or Immobilon membrane, the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) at room temperature for 10 min. It was then washed briefly with TBST and incubated with the primary antibody in 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST three times (10 min each), the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. It was then washed three times with TBST, treated with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. RNA Extraction, RNase Protection Assays (RPA), and Reporter Assays—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or TRIzol extraction. RPA was performed with 10 μg of total RNA using the RNase protection assay kit II (Ambion, Houston, TX) at 55 °C. Sometimes, gradient temperatures were performed for RPA when difficulties in RPA were encountered (35Zhang L. Mol. Biotechnol. 2000; 14: 73-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GAPDH probe was from U. S. Biochemicals. The probe for IFN-β was a gift from Dr. Ganes Sen. The luciferase reporter assays were performed using the assay kit from Promega according to manufacturer's recommendation. Removal of Sendai Virus from Culture Medium—The removal of Sendai virus was achieved by the use of 15-nm Planova virus removal filters (gifts from Asahi Kasei, Pharma Corp.). Seven hours after Sendai virus infection, cell culture media were collected and passed through the Planova filters following the manufacturer's protocol. To test whether the filtered media contain Sendai viruses, the filtered conditional media were used to treat fresh BL41 cells, and the cell lysates were made 24 h later. Western blot with anti-Sendai antibody was used to detect any Sendai proteins in cell lysates. Sendai virus-treated (20 HA units/ml) cell lysates were used as positive controls. IFN-α Measurement and Functional Assay—The concentration of IFN-α was determined by a commercially available human interferon α (Hu-IFN-α) ELISA kit (PBL Biomedical Laboratories; catalog number 41100) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The kit is able to detect human IFN-αA, IFN-α2, IFN-αA/D, IFN-αD, IFN-αK, and IFN-α4b. However, it cannot detect IFN-β, IFN-ω, and other IFN-α subtypes. Samples were examined in triplicates. To test the functions of IFNs in cell culture media, the conditional media were first passed through a 15-nm filter to remove Sendai viruses. These media were then used to treat fresh BL41 cells at desired dilutions for 24 h, and cell lysates were used for the detection of STAT-1 expression. The human IFN-α neutralization antibody (RDI-PB31130) was purchased from Fitzgerald Industries Intl. The antibody is able to react with several kinds of IFN-α subtypes but not IFN-β and IFN-ω. 100,000 neutralization units/ml were added to BL41 cells along with suitable concentration of conditional media and incubated for 24 h. The expression of STAT-1 in BL41 cells was then measured by Western blot analyses. EBV Type III Latency Cells Have Higher Capacity to Produce IFN-β—It is well known that EBV type III latency expresses high levels of IRF-7 and other ISGs, similar to IFN-treated cells. Because IFN can prime the cell for robust IFN production, whether these EBV latency cells are primed for higher IFN production upon viral superinfection was examined. BL41 is an EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma line, and BL41-EBV is its EBV-infected derivative with type III latency. Sav I (type I latency) and Sav III (type III latency) are genetically identical sister cell lines that differ only in their types of latency. These two pairs of cell lines were used to address the presence of EBV type III latency on the production of IFN. Sendai virus was used to infect these cells, and total RNA was isolated 6 h after infection. RPA experiments were used for the detection of IFN-β RNA production. As shown in Fig. 1A, whereas BL41 and Sav I cells had little or no detectable IFN-β production, high IFN-β RNAs were observed in BL41-EBV and Sav III cells, both of which are type III latency cells with LMP-1 expression (Fig. 1B). We also tested IFN-β production in Akata (type I latency) and IB4 (type III latency) cells upon on Sendai infection. Although IB4 could produce high levels of IFN-β, Akata cells failed to produce a significant amount (data not shown). These data suggest that the induction of IFN-β upon viral infection is enhanced in EBV type III latency cells. EBV Type III Latency Cells Produce Functional Type I IFNs upon Superinfection—Type I IFNs are a family of IFN-α, one IFN-β, and one IFN-ω. However, using IFN-β as an indicator for type I IFN production is well established and appreciated in the field (26Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 28Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol.

Virol. 2005; 79: 5640-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the results in Fig. 1 suggest that type I IFNs were robustly induced in EBV latency cells. Because IFN-β RNA is synthesized in EBV-infected cells and because EBV and other herpesviruses encode genes to shut off host gene expression (36Burysek L. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2345-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 37Chou J. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4483-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it is thus necessary to examine whether IFN proteins are synthesized and secreted properly. ELISA was used for the detection of IFN-α proteins in the culture media. As shown in Fig. 2A, the Sendai virus-infected BL41-EBV cells produced huge amount of IFN-α. However, uninfected cells and infected BL41 cells produced undetectable levels of IFN-α, which was in agreement with the data in Fig. 1. These results indicate that IFNs are properly synthesized and secreted from EBV latency cells. Whether these secreted IFNs were functional was tested. The media from Sendai virus-infected or -uninfected cells were collected and passed through 15-nm filters. It is well established that a 15-nm filter is able to eliminate Sendai viruses (41Tolo H. Kauppinen H.L. Alm G. Perers A. Lindeberg E. Wahlstedt-Froberg V. Parkkinen J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the filtered media did not contain detectable Sendai viruses as determined by viral protein expression (data not shown). These conditional media were then used to treat fresh BL41 cells with various dilutions and to determine the expression of STAT-1 24 h later. The reasons to use STAT-1 as an indicator of IFN functions are because STAT-1 is highly inducible by IFN and Sendai virus blocks IFN signaling (42Gotoh B. Komatsu T. Takeuchi K. Yokoo J. Rev. Med. Virol. 2002; 12: 337-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 43Gotoh B. Takeuchi K. Komatsu T. Yokoo J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3360-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 44Komatsu T. Takeuchi K. Yokoo J. Gotoh B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 45Komatsu T. Takeuchi K. Yokoo J. Tanaka Y. Gotoh B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2477-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, a successful induction of STAT-1 may suggest the presence of functional IFNs and absence of Sendai viruses. As shown in Fig. 2B, the conditional medium from BL41-EBV-superinfected cells was ∼10-fold more potent than that from BL41-infected cells for induction of STAT-1. The apparent discrepancy between Fig. 2A (column 2) and 2B (lanes 3–6) might be due to the fact that the ELISA kit only detects a subset of IFN-α (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) and/or that viral superinfection has produced other secretable factors that are capable of inducing STAT-1. Of note is the fact that LMP-1 has been shown to produce a soluble factor(s) that induces STAT-1 (46Richardson C. Fielding C. Rowe M. Brennan P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4439-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whether IFNs in the conditional media were responsible for the induction of STAT-1 was tested with the use of IFN-α neutralization antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, the human IFN-α neutralization antibody partially inhibited the induction of STAT-1. Therefore, type III latency cells had produced functional IFNs, and IFN-β RNA was a good indicator for the robust type I IFN production in this system. The data in Figs. 1 and 2 collectively suggest that EBV type III latency cells are primed for type I IFN production. LMP-1 Primes Cells for the Expression of IFNs—EBV latency cells apparently cannot produce IFNs, based on our previous results and those of others (30Zhang J. Das S.C. Kotalik C. Pattnaik A.K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46335-46342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 47Zhang L. Hong K. Zhang J. Pagano J.

As a matter of fact, Fig. 2 clearly showed that EBV latency cells (BL41-EBV) did not produce significant amounts of IFNs without viral infection (Fig. 2A, column 3, and B, lane 7). Thus, the priming effect of EBV latency cells is likely to be the function of an EBV latent protein(s) rather than the production of IFN by latency cells per se. There are several viral genes expressed in EBV type III latency. However, because LMP-1 induces IRF-7 and other ISGs and has antiviral effect without inducing IFNs (20Zhang L. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5748-5757Google Scholar, 24Zhang L. Wu L.H. Hong K. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12393-12401Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Zhang J. Das S.C. Kotalik C.

Virology. 2004; 323: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and because IRF-7 is a master gene for IFN production (50Honda K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Asagiri M. Sato M. Mizutani T. Shimada N. Ohba Y. Takaoka A. Yoshida N. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar), LMP-1 apparently is a good candidate for the priming action. In addition, EBNA-2, the primary inducer of LMP-1 (51Abbot S.D. Rowe M. Cadwallader K. Ricksten A. Gordon J. Wang F. Rymo L. Rickinson A.B. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2126-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Ghosh D. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1855-1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Tsang S.F. Wang F. Izumi K.M. Kieff E. J.

Virol. 1990; 64: 3407-3416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), might play a role for the priming of the latency cells. DG75 cells, which are EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cells, were used for the experiments because of transfection efficiency. Vector, LMP-1, or EBNA-2 and a CD4 expression plasmid were transfected into cells. Transfected cells were enriched and split into two wells, one of which was infected by viruses. As shown in Fig. 3A, LMP-1 caused a marked increase in IFN-β RNA levels in DG75 cells; however, EBNA-2 did not enhance the expression. The expression of EBNA-2 is confirmed by Western blot (data not shown). Therefore, LMP-1, but not EBNA-2, is probably responsible for the priming effect of type III latency cells. In addition, if EBNA-2 is involved in the priming, it is likely to do so indirectly via induction of LMP-1 in EBV-infected cells. It is of note that the LMP-1-mediated priming effect is similar to IFN priming (Fig. 3B). However, due to the fact that LMP-1 did not induce IFN in DG75 cells in our system (30Zhang J. Das S.C. Kotalik C. Pattnaik A.K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46335-46342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the priming effect must be due to gene(s) regulated by LMP-1. Signaling Derived from LMP-1 Is Required for the Priming Effect—LMP-1 is an integral membrane protein with two regions in the C terminus (CTARs) that have been shown to initiate signaling processes including the activation of NF-κB and IRF-7. LMP-DM is a mutant of LMP-1 in both CTARs that fails to activate NF-κB and IRF-7 (24Zhang L. Wu L.H. Hong K. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12393-12401Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). LMP-1 or LMP-DM and a CD4 expression plasmid were transfected into DG75 cells, and the priming effect of LMP-1 was examined. As shown in Fig. 4, whereas LMP-1 caused a marked increase in IFN-β RNA, LMP-DM seemed to have no effect. The expression of LMP-1 proteins was confirmed (Fig. 4B). Thus, signaling from LMP-1 CTARs is required for the priming action. NF-κB Is Necessary and Sufficient for LMP-1-mediated Priming in DG75 Cells—Next, the roles of intracellular molecules involved in LMP-1-mediated priming action were examined. Because both LMP-1 CTARs can activate NF-κB and because NF-κB plays a pivotal role in the viral latency, whether NF-κB is involved in LMP-1-mediated priming was examined. As shown in Fig. 5A, LMP-1 alone primed cells for high IFN production. However, in the presence of IκB, the priming effect of LMP-1 was completely abolished. IκB was able to block LMP-1-mediated activation of NF-κB (data not shown). Because overexpression of NF-κB is capable of induction of IRF-7 in DG75 cells, we asked whether"

(EC 1.8.7.1) plays an essential role in the reductive assimilation of sulfate by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria by catalyzing the six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide (1Leustek T. Saito K. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a soluble, monomeric protein with a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa and contains a single siroheme and a single [4Fe-4S] cluster as prosthetic groups (2Janick P.A. Siegel L.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3538-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Nakayama M. Akashi T. Hase T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Plant-type ferredoxin (Fd) is a small (11 kDa), one-electron carrier protein with a single [2Fe-2S] cluster and serves as the physiological electron donor for SiR (4Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Onda Y. Ashikari T. Tanaka Y. Kusumi T. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The midpoint redox potential (Em) values for the [4Fe-4S] cluster and siroheme in maize SiR are -400 and -285 mV, respectively (5Hirasawa M. Nakayama M. Hase T. Knaff D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1608: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, electron flow to the enzyme from the reduced Fd, which has an Em value ∼-400 mV, is thermodynamically favorable A transient electron transfer complex is formed between Fd and SiR with 1:1 stoichiometry to facilitate efficient intermolecular electron transfer (6Hirasawa M. Boyer J.M. Gray K.A. Davis D.J. Knaff D.B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 221: 343-348Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 7Akashi T. Matsumura T. Ideguchi T. Iwakiri K. Kawakatsu T. Taniguchi I. Hase T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29399-29405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Other Fd-dependent enzymes of varying molecular size, primary structure, and prosthetic group composition, such as Fd-NADP+ reductase (FNR), nitrite reductase, glutamate synthase, and Fd-thioredoxin reductase, also form productive electron transfer complexes with Fd. Several lines of evidence obtained from chemical modification experiments, cross-linking experiments, and mutagenesis experiments have indicated that the complexes between Fd and these Fd-dependent enzymes are mainly stabilized by electrostatic forces through the negative charges of Fd and positive charges of each enzyme (8Knaff D.B. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 333-361Google Scholar). An example can be seen in the recently determined crystal structure of the complex between maize leaf Fd and FNR (9Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The redox centers of Fd and FNR are in close proximity in the complex to allow fast electron transfer between them. The intermolecular contact site near the redox centers is hydrophobic, and five intermolecular salt bridges are formed around this hydrophobic region to determine the orientation of the two proteins (9Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, no crystal structure of the complex between Fd and any other Fd-dependent enzyme, including SiR, has yet been reported. A series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments on maize Fd demonstrated that certain acidic residues were crucial for interaction and electron transfer with SiR, as is the case for interaction with FNR (7Akashi T. Matsumura T. Ideguchi T. Iwakiri K. Kawakatsu T. Taniguchi I. Hase T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29399-29405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A recent study on chemical modifications of lysine and arginine residues of maize SiR showed that some basic residues are also involved in SiR binding to Fd (10Hirasawa M. Nakayama M. Kim S-K. Hase T. Knaff D.B. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 83: 325-336Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional NMR is a useful technique to study such transient protein-protein interactions of complexes between electron carrier proteins and their partner enzymes (11Zuiderweg E.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 12Crowley P.B. Diaz-Quintana A. Molina-Heredia F.P. Nieto P. Sutter M. Haehnel W. De La Rosa M.A. Ubbink M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6005-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This technique was successfully applied to the study of the electron transfer complex between Fd and FNR (9Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Using Fd enriched in 15N stable isotope, a heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiment correlated the resonance of the amide 15N and 1H nuclei, and all amino acid residues of Fd, except for those near the [2Fe-2S] cluster, could be assigned on the two-dimensional spectrum. As the amide resonance was influenced by even slight changes in the chemical environment, the signals from the residues located at the interface of the complex between Fd and FNR were significantly perturbed upon the complex formation. Notably, the results of the NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments were in good agreement with the assignment of residues located at or near the contact site in the crystal structure, indicating the validity of this analysis (9Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In this study we have further applied this kind of NMR analysis to elucidate the details of the contact area on Fd in the transient complex formed with SiR. In addition, a new measurement called NMR cross-saturation (14Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), using 15N- and 2H-labeled Fd, enabled us to obtain information about the interface. The importance of acidic residues in the contact sites was further demonstrated through mutagenesis experiments. By comparing the detected contact areas of Fd on interaction with SiR and FNR, the structural characteristics of Fd that enable it to form complexes with two different enzymes will be discussed. Preparation—Sample Fd isoprotein from maize leaf (Fd I) (15Hase T. Kimata Y. Yonekura K. Matsumura T. Sakakibara H. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used in this study. Site-specific mutants of Fd, E29Q/E30Q/D34N, E92Q/E93Q, and E29Q/E30Q/D34N/E92Q/E93Q, were prepared with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The synthetic oligonucleotides used for the mutagenesis were CCTGGACCAGGCCCAGCAGGACGGCATCAACCTGCCCTACTCCTGC and GCAGGAGTAGGGCAGGTTGATGCCGTCCTGCTGGGCCTGGTCCAGG for E29Q/E30Q/D34N, and CGTCATCGAGACGCACAAGCAGCAGGAGCTCACCGGCGC and GCGCCGGTGAGCTCCTGCTGCTTGTGCGTCTCGATGACG for E92Q/E93Q, where the underlined bases denote changes from the wild-type sequence. The mutation sites and the sequence integrity of the entire coding regions of the Fds were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type and mutant molecules of maize Fds were expressed in Escherichia coli strain JM109 cells and purified as described previously (16Matsumura T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Murata H. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 15N-labeled Fds were obtained by culturing the bacterial cells in an M9 minimum medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. 2H-, 15N-labeled Fd was obtained by the same procedure, except that medium was prepared with 99% D2O containing [2 15H6]-d-glucose and NH4Cl. Maize SiR was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (3Nakayama M. Akashi T. Hase T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra of WT and mutant Fds were analyzed using a JASCO J720WI spectrometer. Fds were dissolved in a 50-mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl at the final protein concentrations of 91 and 9.1 μm for the measurements in the visible and UV regions, respectively. NMRSpectroscopy—For chemical shift perturbation experiments, 2H, 15N-labeled or 15N-labeled Fd proteins were dissolved at a concentration of 0.1-0.2 mm in a 30-mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 25 mm NaCl and 10% D2O. 1H-15N transverse-relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) HSQC spectra of 2H, 15N-labeled Fd samples mixed with increasing amounts of non-labeled SiR at molar ratios (SiR/Fd) of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.33, 1.67, 2.0, and 3.0 were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker DRX800 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe, operated at the 1H base resonance frequency of 800.13 MHz. 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled wild-type Fd samples mixed with increasing amounts of non-labeled SiR at molar ratios up to 1.0 were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker AV400M spectrometer, operated at the 1H base resonance frequency of 400.13 MHz. 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled E29Q/E30Q/D34N/E92Q/E93Q mutant mixed with increasing amounts of non-labeled SiR at molar ratios of 0, 0.75, and 2.0 were recorded at 298 K on the Bruker DRX800 spectrometer with a cryogenic probe. All the spectra contained WATARGATE just before the direct detection period (17Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. II I Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). Weighted averaged 1H and 15N chemical shift changes were calculated with the equation Δδavr = [(Δδ1HN)2 + (0.17 Δδ15N)2] 1/2. Cross-saturation experiments (14Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Nakanishi T. Miyazawa M. Sakakura M. Terasawa H. Takahashi H. Shimada I. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were employed at 298 K on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer, operated at the 1H base resonance frequency of 600.13 MHz, or on the Bruker DRX800 spectrometer with a cryogenic probe. Fd, labeled uniformly with the 15N and 2H isotopes, was dissolved at a concentration of 0.5-1 mm in a 30-mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 25 mm NaCl and 90% D2O. The HSQC part of the pulse sequence was constructed by a normal INEPT and reverse INEPT type (17Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. II I Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar, 18Nakanishi T. Miyazawa M. Sakakura M. Terasawa H. Takahashi H. Shimada I. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The radio frequency wave for the saturation was applied for 2.0 s just before the HSQC part by 200 times of sequential repeats of an adiabatic pulse with an amplitude modulation of a hyperbolic secant, a frequency sweep range of 1000 Hz, a duration of 10 ms, a maximum amplitude of 200 Hz, and an excitation center at 1.5 or 0.9 ppm by the phase modulation. The simulation confirmed that the two kinds of pulse excited only aliphatic and methyl resonance regions and had no effect of perturbation on the water resonance. Non-labeled SiR was added at a molar ratio of 0.5. All the spectra were processed with NMRPipe software (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and analyzed with Sparky software developed by T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller at University of California, San Francico. Affinity Chromatography—10 mg of SiR was immobilized on 2 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the method recommended by the supplier. A small column packed with 2 ml of SiR-immobilized resin was mounted onto a chromatography system (AKTA prime; Amersham Biosciences). After equilibrating the column with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 μl of 100 μm wild-type Fd or mutant Fd was loaded onto the column and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 450 mm at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Elution of Fd was monitored by the absorbance at 430 nm (A430), and the conductivity of the eluate was correspondingly monitored. Enzyme Assay—Activity of SiR was assayed with a reconstituted electron transfer system from NADPH to sulfite using FNR as described previously (4Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Onda Y. Ashikari T. Tanaka Y. Kusumi T. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained Fd (0-40 μm), FNR (100 nm), SiR (800 nm), and sulfite (0.5 mm) in 30-mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and 25 mm NaCl. The reaction was initiated by adding NADPH (0.2 mm), and the oxidation of NADPH was monitored by the decrease at A340. Chemical Shift Perturbation Experiment—A series of 1H-15N TROSY HSQC spectra of 2H, 15N-labeled Fd was measured as a function of the molar ratios of non-labeled SiR to Fd. As shown in Fig. 1, the amide resonance of most Fd residues was well observed except for those in three regions: Ser-38 to Ala-48, Ser-62, and Thr-76 to His-78, whose signals were hardly detected due to paramagnetic relaxation enhancement caused by the [2Fe-2S] cluster of Fd. A general broadening of the resonance signals that should have occurred upon addition of SiR was minimized by the TROSY effect, and concomitant chemical shift changes were well observed only for certain residues. Titration curves of the chemical shift changes upon addition of SiR are shown for representative residues perturbed to varying extents (Fig. 2); all residues exhibited an almost saturated state in their chemical shift change at the molar ratio of ∼1.5. This type of resonance shift change between the extreme shifts in the free and complex forms indicated that the two states underwent fast exchange on the NMR time scale. An average Kd value was calculated as 12.9 ± 3.2 μm from the titration curves of 20 residues, showing significant chemical shift changes.FIGURE 2Titration curves of chemical shift changes in 1H-15N TROSY HSQC spectra observed for representative residues of 2H, 15N-labeled Fd. The chemical shift changes of the indicated residues are plotted as a function of the molar ratio of SiR to Fd. Weighted averaged 1H and 15N chemical shift changes, Δδavr, were calculated with the equation described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For each amide group of Fd, the changes in the 1H and 15N chemical shifts were combined according to the equation described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the resulting values are shown in Fig. 3a. The Fd residues that exhibited significant chemical shift perturbations (>0.08 ppm and 0.06-0.08 ppm) are graphically visualized on the three-dimensional structure in two color codes (Fig. 3b). Complex formation with SiR significantly influenced the resonance of Glu-13, Ile-24, Leu-25, Ala-28, Glu-29, Glu-30, Gly-32, Asp-34, Leu-35, Tyr-37, Gln-61, Tyr-63, Leu-64, His-90, Lys-91, Glu-92, Glu-93, Glu-94, and Ala-98. These residues are distributed in areas surrounding the [2Fe-2S] cluster; most are located on the surface of the Fd molecule, although some of the moderately influenced residues such as Ile-24 and Leu-25 are buried inside the molecule. We assume that most of the amide resonance changes are due to protein-protein interaction of Fd and SiR. A series of conventional 1H-15N HSQC spectra, instead of the TROSY version, 15N-labeled Fd was also measured in the presence of SiR at the molar ratios of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0. Under the highest molar ratio of 1.0, the resonance derived from 15% of Fd amide groups was broadened to a large extent, most probably because of the large molecular size of the complex, and unambiguous assignment of the peak positions was almost impossible. Although the degrees of the broadening effects observed in the conventional and TROSY 15N-HSQC spectra were outstandingly different, we confirmed that the patterns in the chemical shift perturbation, such as the magnitude and direction of each shift, were the same at least in the respective spectra at a molar ratio of 0.75 (supplemental Fig. S1). Cross-saturation Transfer Experiment—To further investigate the interaction of Fd with SiR, a cross-saturation experiment was performed. Upon complex formation with SiR, saturation of the proton magnetization in the whole SiR can be transferred to the interaction interface of Fd, and thereby the intensity of cross-peaks derived from the amide protons in interaction sites is decreased. For this experiment, Fd was labeled uniformly with 2H(>97%) and 15N to avoid the magnetization of any aliphatic and methyl proton of Fd from being saturated directly by the radiofrequency2pulses. This labeled Fd was dissolved in a buffer of 10% 1H2O and 90% 2H2O to decrease the saturation transfer through H2O and spatially crowded amide protons. We set the center of the irradiation at 1.5 ppm such that the irradiation pulses covered the aliphatic proton resonance region but at the same time did not perturb the water magnetization. Typical 1H-15N TROSY HSQC spectra of Fd with and without the irradiation in the presence of SiR at the molar ratio of 0.5 are shown in Fig. 4a. The intensity of cross-peak of Gly-32 predominantly decreased in the saturation condition. The intensity ratios of the cross-peaks for all the observed Fd residues in the presence and absence of SiR are shown in Fig. 4b. A selective saturation effect was observed in a region containing residues Glu-30, Asp-31, Gly-32, Ile-33, and Asp-34 that showed significantly reduced ratios in comparison with other residues. When these results were compared with the chemical shift mapping data (Fig. 3), these residues were located at or near the regions where a large chemical shift perturbation was observed. We also examined the cross-saturation effect when the resonance region for methyl protons was irradiated by shifting the excitation center to 0.9 ppm as shown in supplemental Fig. S2. A strong saturation effect was observed again in the residues from Gly-32 to Asp-34, confirming the above result obtained at the excitation center at 1.5 ppm. Some of the residues with methyl groups exhibited low intensity ratios even in the absence of SiR. This phenomenon was most probably caused by a small amount of 1H being mixed into the methyl groups of Fd side chains. Effect of Mutation at the Interaction Interface of Fd—NMR experiments indicated that the two acidic patches on the surface of Fd are involved in interaction with SiR, one region containing Glu-29, Glu-30, and Asp-34 and the other containing Glu-92, Glu-93, and Glu-94 (Fig. 3b). To confirm the importance of these regions to protein-protein interaction, the acidic residues contained in each or both of these regions were substituted to the corresponding amide form and their electron transfer ability to SiR was examined by kinetic analysis. Three of the mutants generated, E92Q/E93Q (DM), E29Q/E30Q/D34N (TM), and E29Q/E30Q/D34N/E92Q/E93Q (QM) Fds, showed a significantly lower electron transfer ability compared with WT Fd as shown by kinetic parameters in Table 1. QM Fd retained the least ability among the mutant Fds. Physical binding of these mutant Fds to SiR was further examined using SiR-immobilized Sepharose resin as shown in Fig. 5. Fds were applied to chromatography utilizing the SiR column over a linear gradient of NaCl. The elution time of WT Fd corresponded to conductivity of 20 mS/cm2, whereas mutant Fds were eluted at lower conductivity in the following order, DM, TM, and QM Fd. There was therefore good agreement among the kinetic and static evaluations of the mutation effects on complex formation, indicating that the two acidic patches on Fd contribute to interaction with SiR.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of SiR for wild-type and mutant Fds in NADPH· sulfite reductionKmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1μm−1 s−1WTaWT, wild-type Fd.4.0 ± 0.23.65 ± 0.020.91DMbDM, E92Q/E93Q.6.2 ± 1.12.70 ± 0.100.44TMcTM, E29Q/E30Q/D34N.9.5 ± 2.22.66 ± 0.240.28QMdQM, E92Q/E93Q/E29Q/E30Q/D34N Fds.14.7 ± 2.32.10 ± 0.050.14a WT, wild-type Fd.b DM, E92Q/E93Q.c TM, E29Q/E30Q/D34N.d QM, E92Q/E93Q/E29Q/E30Q/D34N Fds. Open table in a new tab A 1N-15H HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled QM Fd was measured and exhibited a chemical shift pattern very similar to that of WT Fd (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that no major change of the polypeptide folding was induced by the mutation. We also confirmed that any significant change occurred neither in the secondary structure nor in the [2Fe-2S] cluster environment in the other mutant Fds as evidenced by the comparison of CD spectra in the visible and ultraviolet regions (supplemental Fig. S4). Perturbation in several HSQC signals of QM Fd was observed upon addition of non-labeled SiR, but the extents of the perturbation became lower in comparison with that of WT; this phenomenon was remarkable around the mutated sites as shown in Fig. 6. These combined data demonstrate a direct effect of the mutation on the protein-protein interaction between Fd and SiR. Comparison of the Interaction Interface of Fd with SiR and FNR—The atomic structure of the electron transfer complex of plant Fd and FNR was determined by x-ray crystallographic analysis, and details of their protein-protein interaction are now known (9Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The same complex was also analyzed with NMR chemical shift perturbation technique, and the Fd regions that interacted with FNR in solution were in good agreement with those determined by the crystallographic data (9Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To compare the NMR data obtained from the complex of Fd and SiR with those of the complex of Fd and FNR, we again measured the chemical shift changes of 15N-labeled Fd in the presence of FNR or SiR as a side by side experiment. As shown in Fig. 7a there are significant differences in the chemical shift change patterns between the two complexes. In the complex with FNR, the acidic patch consisting of Asp-65 and Asp-66 along with Gln-61, Leu-64, and Gln-68, which showed remarkable chemical shift perturbations, is the major interaction site on Fd with FNR (Fig. 7b). In addition to this acidic patch, the resonance of the C-terminal tail from Leu-95 to Ala-98 of Fd also strongly shifted upon complex with FNR. In the previous report Asp-60 was also strongly shifted (9Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), but the present data in Fig. 7a show no such significant perturbation. We observed that perturbation of this residue sharply decreased with increasing salt concentration and confirmed that under previous low salt conditions (in the presence of 10 mm NaCl) a large perturbation was observed (data not shown). Mapping of the interaction site on Fd with FNR (Fig. 7b) significantly differs when the interaction partner is SiR (Fig. 7c), indicative of two different interaction ways of Fd toward the respective enzymes, although the [2Fe-2S] cluster seems to be located at the interface of Fd and the partner enzyme in both cases. We observed significant chemical shift perturbation of the 1H-15N TROSY HSQC spectra of Fd upon interaction with SiR. Biochemical data show that Fd and SiR form a complex of 1:1 stoichiometry and that the affinity of SiR for Fd in the reaction of Fd-dependent sulfite reduction is high, as demonstrated by the Km value of ∼5 μm (3Nakayama M. Akashi T. Hase T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Akashi T. Matsumura T. Ideguchi T. Iwakiri K. Kawakatsu T. Taniguchi I. Hase T. J. Biol.

Res. 2005; 83: 325-336Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the present study, the physical binding constant between SiR and Fd has been determined to be 13 μm from the titration results of chemical shift changes in the TROSY HSQC spectra. This value in the μm range agrees well with the Km value determined from the SiR activity assay using Fd as an electron donor. This fact suggests that the complex of Fd and SiR observed by our NMR measurements corresponds to the one that is kinetically competent for intermolecular electron transfer. This NMR study gives a clear picture of the molecular interaction mode of Fd with SiR. The Fd residues with the most significant alterations in NMR spectra are Ala-28 to Tyr-37, Gln-61 to Leu-64, and His-90 to Glu-94, and these three regions are located around the [2Fe-2S] cluster on the three-dimensional structure of Fd (Fig. 3).Chemical shift changes could be interpreted as arising either from direct protein-protein interactions or from secondary effects, such as conformational change beyond the contact interface and/or alteration in electronic shielding upon complex formation. The cross-saturation experiment concluded that the region around Gly-32 is most probably located at the intermolecular interface and plays a role in the interaction between Fd and SiR. The importance of this region was also confirmed by further NMR measurements and other biochemical analyses of the complex formation by using mutant Fds. Cross-saturation effect was not so clearly detected for the two regions around Gln-61 to Leu-64 and His-90 to Glu-94, where large chemical shift changes were, however, observed. As the saturation transfer efficiency depends mainly on the distance between the donor and acceptor sites of saturated magnetization, these two Fd regions may not be so close to the SiR surface as the region around Ala-28 to Tyr-37. Nevertheless, the possibility that these two regions are far from the interaction site does not seem to be high, because the mutation of Glu-92 and Glu-93 exhibited a significant effect on the binding of Fd to SiR. Therefore, we believe that our mapping of the chemical shift changes well reflects features of the protein-protein interaction between Fd and SiR. The results of gel filtration chromatography (7Akashi T. Matsumura T. Ideguchi T. Iwakiri K. Kawakatsu T. Taniguchi I. Hase T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29399-29405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and spectral perturbation experiments (10Hirasawa M. Nakayama M. Kim S-K. Hase T. Knaff D.B. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 83: 325-336Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) showed that Fd and SiR form a complex of high affinity at a lower ionic strength but such molecular interaction does not occur at a higher ionic strength, indicative of the major contribution of electrostatic force to stabilizing the complex. Previous experiments, using site-specific mutants of root-type Fd isoform from maize, demonstrated that negatively charged residues of Fd participate in this electrostatic interaction (7Akashi T. Matsumura T. Ideguchi T. Iwakiri K. Kawakatsu T. Taniguchi I. Hase T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29399-29405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Of the three regions of Fd that we have proposed as being involved in interaction with SiR, two regions are rich in acidic residues forming a negatively charged molecular surface; one contains Glu-29, Glu-30, and Asp-34 and the other Glu-92, Glu-93, and Glu-94. The results of experiments on root Fd (7Akashi T. Matsumura T. Ideguchi T. Iwakiri K. Kawakatsu T. Taniguchi I. Hase T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29399-29405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) are consistent with the conclusions obtained from leaf Fd in this study, suggesting that both types of Fd interact with SiR in a similar way. The acidic patches seem to be cooperatively involved in electrostatic interaction with SiR, because the simultaneous mutation of both patches resulted in more remarkable loss of ability in interaction with SiR than the separate mutations of each patch (Fig. 5). Thus, one would expect that at least two positively charged surfaces on SiR operate as the counterparts of the Fd acidic patches when the complex is formed. This was experimentally suggested by chemical modification of lysine and arginine residues of SiR that caused an inhibitory effect on Fd-dependent activity of SiR, but not on redox dye-dependent activity (10Hirasawa M. Nakayama M. Kim S-K. Hase T. Knaff D.B. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 83: 325-336Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The two acidic patches of Fd are conserved among Fds from various species. By site-specific mutational study of several Fds, it has been reported that the two acidic patches are involved in the interaction with Fd ·thioredoxin reductase in spinach (20De Pascalis A.R. Schurmann P. Bosshard H.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Chlamydomonas (21Jacquot J.P. Stein M. Suzuki A. Liottet S. Sandoz G. Miginiac-Maslow M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and nitrite reductase in Chlamydomonas (22Garcia-Sanchez M.I. Diaz-Quintana A. Gotor C. Jacquot J.P. De la Rosa M.A. Vega J.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These data suggest a general importance of the common acidic patches for interaction with different Fd-dependent enzymes. However, this is not the case for FNR. When the profile of chemical shift changes of Fd in complex with FNR is compared with data of the complex with SiR (Fig. 7a), the regions of Fd forming the two acidic patches (Ala-28 to Leu-35 and His-90 to Glu-94) show no remarkable chemical shift changes, whereas a separate acidic region around Glu-65 and Glu-66 that is also evolutionally conserved showed the largest chemical shift change in the complex with FNR. In fact, Glu-65 and Glu-66 of Fd form strong salt bridges with Lys-91 and Lys-88 of FNR, respectively, as shown in the crystal structure of the Fd ·FNR complex (9Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This suggests that the binding sites of Fd vary appreciably between FNR and SiR as visualized in Fig. 7, b and c. The NMR signals for residues Ser-38 to Ala-48, Ser-62, and Thr-76 to His-78 are not observed due to paramagnetic relaxation enhancement of the iron atoms of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, and it is difficult to draw the features of the overall topology of Fd for interaction with partner enzymes from NMR data only. In the crystal structure of the complex between Fd and FNR, NMR undetectable residues produce a hydrophobic environment at the interface of the two proteins, which allows a direct electron transfer between the [2Fe-2S] cluster of Fd and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) of FNR over a distance of 6 Å (9Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Katoh E. Yamazaki T. Teshima K. Onda Y. Kimata-Ariga Y. Hase T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The area surrounding this hydrophobic region, which contributes to fine adjustment of the topology of the two proteins, shows large chemical shift changes (Fig. 7b). In the case of the complex of Fd and SiR, almost all residues showing large chemical shift changes are also distributed in the side of the [2Fe-2S] cluster; therefore, it is reasonable to predict that the complex of Fd and SiR forms in a way that the [2Fe-2S] cluster side is facing to the electron acceptance side of SiR, although the details of intermolecular electron transfer are not predictable without information of the three-dimensional structure of the Fd ·SiR complex. Fd is an electron carrier that distributes reducing power to various redox enzymes in chloroplasts and non-photosynthetic plastids. To understand this multifunctionality of Fd, early investigations into the molecular evolution of Fd (23Fukuyama K. Hase T. Matsumoto S. Tsukihara T. Katsube Y. Tanaka N. Kakudo M. Wada K. Matsubara H. Nature. 1980; 286: 522-524Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and interactions between Fd and Fd-dependent enzymes (24Knaff D.B. Hirasawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 93-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) postulated that the conserved acidic residues, which are distributed across several areas on the Fd surface, are crucial for specific interaction with various Fd-dependent enzymes. However, it has not been well understood whether Fd interacts with partner enzymes in a similar way or whether Fd has binding domains specific for each enzyme. Although no crystal structure of the complex of Fd and Fd-dependent enzymes other than FNR is available yet, this study can conclude that at least two enzymes such as SiR and FNR utilize a different combination of the acidic regions of Fd to form a complex suitable for intermolecular electron transfer. We are now investigating the above questions in more detail by applying this NMR technique to other Fd-dependent enzymes. Download .pdf (.35 MB) Help with pdf files"

Excess, deficiency, or alteration in tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids has been associated with major causes of human morbidity and mortality. Brx, a cytoplasmic Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, binds to and influences the activity of several nuclear hormone receptors. We examined the functional and molecular interactions between GR and Brx. The glucocorticoid sensitivity of lymphocytes obtained from mice haplo-insufficient for Brx was significantly decreased. Conversely, GR-mediated transcriptional activity of a glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-mediated glucocorticoid-responsive promoter was enhanced by Brx in a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain-dependent fashion. Brx interacted with GR, forming a ternary complex with RhoA. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, Brx and RhoA were co-precipitated with GREs only in the presence of ligand-activated GR. Extracellularly administered lysophosphatidic acid, which activates its signaling cascade through a specific membrane GTP-binding protein (G-protein)-coupled receptor in a G-protein α13-, Brx-, and RhoA-dependent fashion, enhanced GR transcriptional activity, whereas depletion of endogenous Brx attenuated this effect. These findings suggest that glucocorticoid signaling and, hence, the tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids, may be coupled to extracellular signals via Brx and small G-proteins. Nuclear Brx might act as a local GRE-GR-transcriptosome activator by mediating the effect of small G-proteins on glucocorticoid-regulated genes.

Glucocorticoids exert profound influences on many physiologic functions by virtue of their extremely diverse roles in growth, development, and maintenance of cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune homeostasis (1Chrousos G.P.

Charmandari E. Mirani M. Chrousos G.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In its unliganded state, GR is located primarily in the cytoplasm, as part of hetero-oligomeric complexes containing heat shock proteins 90, 70, and 50, and possibly other proteins (7Kino T. Chrousos G.P. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 109: 609-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After ligand binding GR undergoes conformational changes, dissociates from heat shock proteins, homodimerizes, and translocates into the nucleus. There, the ligand-activated GR directly interacts with DNA sequences, the glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), in the promoter regions of target genes and regulates their transcriptional activity (7Kino T. Chrousos G.P. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 109: 609-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Accumulating evidence indicates that many extracellular molecules including hormones, growth factors, and cytokines, influence biologic activity of glucocorticoids at several GR activation steps. Resultant changes in GR transcriptional activity play a role in the physiologic regulation of glucocorticoid actions and the development of pathologic conditions, such as glucocorticoid-resistant asthma and “dysmetabolic syndrome,” which is associated with visceral-type obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance/overt diabetes mellitus (5Kino T.

The Rho family proteins, which include RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1, play an important role in the reorganization of cytoskeleton, embryonic development, and regulation of gene expression after their activation by numerous extracellular stimuli (13Takai Y.

Acta. 2002; 1582: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).The small G-proteins exist in active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms (13Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol.

Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). The guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which contain specific protein motifs characterized by the Dbl homology (DH) domain followed by the pleckstrin homology domain, catalyze the conversion of the GDP-bound to the GTP-bound form, indicating that this class of proteins plays an essential role in the activation of small G-proteins (23Cherfils J.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). After regulating the activity of their target molecules, GTP-bound small G-proteins are immediately returned to the GDP-associated form via their intrinsic GTPase activity (13Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar).Several Rho family small G-protein-specific GEFs have been recently cloned (23Cherfils J. Chardin P.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). We first cloned a 1429-residue GEF protein called Brx by using the ligand binding domain of the retinoic X receptor β as bait in expression cloning (25Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind S. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); interestingly, Brx not only acts as a Rho family GEF but also binds to nuclear hormone receptors via its C-terminal portion (nuclear receptor-interacting domain (NRID)) and enhances transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptors α (25Rubino D.

Rubino D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46792-476797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). AKAP-Brx (Lbc), a larger splicing variant of Brx with an additional 1389-amino acid residues, was subsequently reported (27Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This transcript possesses a protein kinase A docking domain in its N-terminal portion and a full Brx sequence-containing GEF domain and NRID at its C-terminal half (27Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Inclusion of NRID and/or a protein kinase A docking domain in Brx and AKAP-Brx indicates that this class of GEFs acts as an integrator of signal transduction pathways to tune their independent signals toward orchestrated final biologic actions.In this report we show that Brx modifies the actions of glucocorticoids, enhancing the transcriptional activity of GR by interacting with GR and by attracting Rho family G-proteins to the GR-induced transcriptosome. It appears that Brx, via its two functionally distinct domains GEF and NRID, acts as a bridging factor between several intracellular signaling systems, such as those induced through transmembrane receptors and small G-proteins and those of the GR and other nuclear hormone receptors. These results indicate that Brx acts as a determinant of target tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids and, thus, may play a role in the development of highly prevalent human disorders with major metabolic and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (7Kino T.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). pBK/RSV-FLAG-BrxY769F was constructed with the PCR-assisted mutagenesis reaction by using pBK/RSV-FLAG-Brx as a template. This plasmid expresses a FLAG-Brx mutant, which has a replacement of tyrosine at amino acid 769 with phenylalanine that causes the inactivation of the GEF activity in the wild type Brx (23Cherfils J.

Gutkind (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). pCEV-C3 and pCDNA3-N17Cdc42, which express the botulinum toxin C3 and a dominant negative form of Cdc42, and, thus, inhibit the action of RhoA and Cdc42, respectively, were also provided by Dr. J. S. Gutkind. pCDNA3-Gα13G225A, which expresses a transdominant negative form of Gα13 (27Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol.

Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). pMMTV-Luc, which has the luciferase gene under the control of the GREs-containing and glucocorticoid-responsive murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, was a kind gift from Dr. G. L. Hager (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). pBK/RSV, pCDNA3, and pSV40-β-Gal were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), Invitrogen, and Promega (Madison, WI), respectively.Brx-haplo-insufficient Mice and Separation of Splenic Lymphocytes—Briefly, targeted disruption of the brx gene was performed using standard homologous recombination by insertion of a Neor cassette, resulting in elimination of an exon encoding amino acids 752–1044 of Brx transcript (25Rubino D.

These residues are required for GEF activity and are highly conserved throughout Rho GEF family members, as described (see Ref. 28Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for the null brx allele died in utero (29McDaniel K. Mayers C. Venere M. Driggers P. Westphal H. Gorivodsky M. Segars J. J. Soc. Gynecol. Investig. 2004; 11 (suppl.) (Abstr. 375): 199Crossref Google Scholar). Mice haplo-insufficient (+/–) for the null brx allele appeared grossly normal. Genotypes of adult, embryos, and neonate mice were confirmed using Southern analysis and PCR. Details of the construction and phenotype of the brx null mice will be presented elsewhere. 3J. Wadell, C. Mayers, M. Venere, K. McLean, K. Sarber, P. Driggers, K. Pagliai, M. Gorivodsky, H. Westphal, and J. Segars, manuscript in preparation. Spleens were dissected from mice haplo-insufficient for the brx gene and wild type mice, minced, and passed through nylon cell strainers (BD Biosciences). The obtained extracts were further purified with the gradient separation using the Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain the splenic lymphocytes.Thymidine Incorporation Assay in Splenic Lymphocytes—1 × 105 of the splenic lymphocytes were plated in 24-well plates, 5 μg/well of concanavalin A (Sigma) and increasing concentrations of dexamethasone (Sigma) were added, and the cells were cultured for 72 h. 0.25 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was then added into the wells. After 4 h of additional culture, the cells were harvested and treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (MG Scientific Inc., Pleasant Prairie, WI). Cell pellets were then dissolved in 1 m NaOH, and their radioactivity was determined using a LS 6000IC β-counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Results were demonstrated as percentages of radioactivity obtained in each concentration of dexamethasone to that observed without dexamethasone. The experiments were performed with hexaplicate and repeated three times.Cell Culture and Transfection—Human cervical carcinoma HeLa and African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas. VA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units of penicillin, 1 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate, 10% of fetal bovine serum, and 25 mm of HEPES. Human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells were also purchased from ATCC and were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium with the same supplements. Twenty-four hours before transfection, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in 12-well plates. Transfection was performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectin™ (Invitrogen). The cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg/well of pMMTV-Luc, 0.2 μg/well of pSV40-β-Gal, 0.1–0.5 μg/well of FLAG-Brx-expressing plasmids, and/or 0.1–0.5 μg/well of RhoA-, Cdc42-, Gα13G225A-, C3-, or N17Cdc42-expressing plasmids. Because HeLa cells express endogenous GR, whereas CV-1 and HCT116 cells are devoid of the receptor, 0.1 μg/well of pRShGRα was included in the transfection medium for the latter two cell types (30De Martino M.U. Bhattachryya N. Alesci S. Ichijo T. Chrousos G.P. Kino T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 820-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after the transfection 10–6 m dexamethasone was added to the medium. After an additional 24 h the cells were lysed with a reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (BD PharMingen), as previously described (31Kino T.

Luciferase activity was normalized for β-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection efficiency.Western Blot and Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—2 × 106 of HeLa cells were plated in 75-cm2 flasks 24 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with 15 μg of pBK/RSV-FLAG-Brx or -BrxY769F using FuGENE 6. Forty-eight hours after the transfection the cells were treated with 10–6 m dexamethasone or vehicle for 5 h. Cell lysis and co-immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out in the lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, Complete™ tablets 1 tablet/50 ml, as reported previously (31Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated with anti-Brx, -FLAG (M2), or -GRα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies or control serum bound to protein A/G-agarose PLUS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Precipitated proteins were run on 6% or 8% SDS-PAGE gels and subsequently blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. Membrane-attached FLAG-Brx, RhoA, or GR were visualized with anti-Brx, -RhoA, and -GRα antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and subsequent treatment with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Endogenous or expressed RhoA, GR, and/or FLAG-Brx were determined with Western blots in 10% of cell lysates, which were used in the co-immunoprecipitation reactions. To compare expression levels of wild type FLAG-Brx, BrxY769, and Brx-(1042–1429), HeLa cells were transfected with their expression plasmids or a control plasmid together with pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein. Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer, and whole cell homogenates were run on 8–16% SDS-PAGE gels. After blotting, bands were visualized with anti-FLAG (M2) antibody for Brx-related molecules or anti-GFP antibody (Clontech). Band density in three different experiments was quantified with the Science Lab 2003 Image Gauge Version 4.1 software (Fuji Photo Film USA, Inc., Valhalla, NY), and relative expression levels of Brx-related molecules were shown as a ratio of their band density divided by that of enhanced green fluorescence protein.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed in HCT116/MMTV cells, which have the genomic integrated MMTV-luciferase gene (33Ichijo T. Voutetakis A. Cotrim A.P. Bhattachryya N. Fujii M. Chrousos G.P. Kino T. J. Biol.

They were transfected with pRShGRα to express functional GR. In some experiments the cells were also transfected with the Brx siRNA (5′-AAAGCCAGAGGAAGAGCAUUUdTdT-3′), which targets nucleotides 219–239 of the Brx coding region, that were produced by Qiagen (Valencia, CA), or control lamin A/C siRNA (Qiagen) using the x-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were exposed to either 10–6 m dexamethasone or vehicle for 5 h. The cells were then fixed, DNA and bound proteins were cross-linked, and ChIP assays were performed by co-precipitating the DNA-protein complexes with anti-Brx, anti-RhoA, anti-FLAG, anti-GRα antibodies, or rabbit control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as previously reported (34Kino T. Tiulpakov A. Ichijo T. Chheng L. Kozasa T. Chrousos G.P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The promoter region –219 to –47 of the MMTV long terminal repeat that contains two functional GREs was amplified from the prepared DNA samples using a primer pair 5′-AACCTTGCGGTTCCCAG-3′ and 5′-GCATTTACATAAGATTTGG-3′ (fragment size, 173 bp). A distal region –1158 to –935 of the MMTV promoter, which does not contain GREs, was amplified using a primer pair 5′-GAGAGTGTCCTACACCTAGG-3′ and 5′-GTAATCTTGCACAGAAGAGC-3′ (fragment size, 224 bp). The promoter region –777 to –516 of the glucocorticoid-unresponsive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter, which does not contain GREs, was also amplified using a primer pair 5′-GATTGTCTGCCCTAATTATC-3′ and 5′-CAGGCAAAGGCCTAGGAG-3′ (fragment size, 261 bp). Amplified products were then run on a 2–3% agarose gel, and the visualized DNA bands were photographed.Inhibition of Brx Expression by siRNA and Evaluation of the FKBP51 and Brx/AKAP-Brx mRNA Levels in the Quantitative Real-time PCR—8 × 104 of HCT116 cells were plated on 24-well plates. After 24 h, 1 μg of the siRNA for Brx or lamin A/C and 0.5 μg of pRShGRα were transfected with x-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 1–10 μg/ml LPA (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) and/or 10–6 m dexamethasone and were cultured for an additional 24 h. The cells were then lysed with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out using the random hexamers with TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To detect mRNA levels of Brx/AKAP-Brx, 51-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP51) and control human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (RPLP0), primer pairs (Brx/AKAP-Brx: forward primer, 5′-CAGTGATGACATGGACAG-3′, reverse primer, 5′-TCGGTGGATGAACTGGATC-3′; FKBP51: forward primer, 5′-AAAAGGCCAAGGAGCACAAC-3′, reverse primer, 5′-TTGAGGAGGGGCCGAGTTC-3′; RPLP0: forward primer, 5′-CGCGACCTGGAAGTCCAACT-3′, reverse primer, 5′-CCATCAGCACCACAGCCTTC-3′) were used (35Vermeer H. Hendriks-Stegeman B.I. van der Burg B. van Buul-Offers S.C. Jansen M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The real-time PCR reaction, consisting of the heat activation of the Taq polymerase (10 min at 95 °C) and the subsequent 60 PCR cycles (denaturing, 15 s at 95 °C; annealing/extension, 1 min at 60 °C) was performed in quadruplicate using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI PRIZM 7700 SDS lightcycler (Applied Biosystems). Obtained CT (threshold cycle) values of FKBP51 and Brx/AKAP-Brx were normalized for those of RPLP0, and their relative mRNA expressions were demonstrated as -fold induction to the base line. The dissociation curves of the primer pairs used showed a single peak, and samples after PCR reactions had a single expected DNA band in an agarose gel analysis (data not shown).Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was carried out by analysis of variance followed by Student's t test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons or unpaired t test with the two-tailed p value. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative results are shown in the figures.RESULTSBrx Is Necessary for Glucocorticoid Action in Mouse Splenic Lymphocytes—In previous studies we noted that Brx was expressed in immune organs, such as peripheral and splenic lymphocytes (25Rubino D.

https://openalex.org/W1996127034,"In the present study, we identified a novel splice variant of the human cardiac Na+ channel Nav1.5 (Nav1.5d), in which a 40-amino acid sequence of the DII/DIII intracellular linker is missing due to a partial deletion of exon 17. Expression of Nav1.5d occurred in embryonic and adult hearts of either sex, indicating that the respective alternative splicing is neither age-dependent nor gender-specific. In contrast, Nav1.5d was not detected in the mouse heart, indicating that alternative splicing of Nav1.5 is species-dependent. In HEK293 cells, splice variant Nav1.5d generated voltage-dependent Na+ currents that were markedly reduced compared with wild-type Nav1.5. Experiments with mexiletine and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP suggested that the trafficking of Nav1.5d channels was not impaired. However, single-channel recordings showed that the whole-cell current reduction was largely due to a significantly reduced open probability. Additionally, steady-state activation and inactivation were shifted to depolarized potentials by 15.9 and 5.1 mV, respectively. Systematic mutagenesis analysis of the spliced region provided evidence that a short amphiphilic region in the DII/DIII linker resembling an S4 voltage sensor of voltage-gated ion channels is an important determinant of Nav1.5 channel gating. Moreover, the present study identified novel short sequence motifs within this amphiphilic region that specifically affect the voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation and current amplitude of human Nav1.5.

Suppression of Na+ channel activity could be physiologically important for embryonic excitable cells or for adult nonexcitable tissues that express an undesired Na+ channel isoform constitutively (4Plummer N.W.

In the mammalian heart, the Na+ channel isoform Nav1.5 is thought to determine the major electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of the INa in atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes (1Goldin A.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 871-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 19Balser J.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 599-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The mouse heart expresses two alternatively spliced variants of Nav1.5, Nav1.5a (mH1-2) and Nav1.5b (mH1-3), both with deletions in the DII/III intracellular loop (7Zimmer T. Bollensdorff C. Haufe V. Birch-Hirschfeld E. Benndorf K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1007-H1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Splice variant Nav1.5a, which has been also discovered previously in a rat hippocampal progenitor stem cell line (HiB5) (6Korsgaard M.P.G. Christophersen P. Ahring P.K. Olesen S.-P. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 443: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), generates currents indistinguishable from wild-type Nav1.5, whereas Nav1.5b does not form functional channels. The first human Nav1.5 splice variant detected was Nav1.5c (hH1c) (15Makielski J.C. Ye B. Valdivia C.R. Pagel M.D. Pu J. Tester D.J. Ackerman M.J. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), which lacks a single amino acid at position 1077 and represents the preferred alternatively spliced variant in the heart. Electrophysiological measurements in HEK293 cells revealed a faster recovery from inactivation and a shift of steady-state inactivation by 7 mV toward depolarized potentials in Nav1.5c (hH1c) versus Nav1.5 (hH1) channels. In addition to these naturally occurring splice variants, two different mutations in intronic sequences of the human cardiac Na+ channel were shown to be responsible for completely skipping exon 22 or for partially deleting exon 27, causing Lenègre disease (8Probst V. Kyndt F. Potet F. Trochu J.N. Mialet G. Demolombe S. Schott J.J. Baro I. Escande D. Le Marec H. J. Am. Coll.

In the present study, we describe a novel splice variant of Nav1.5 (named Nav1.5d) that could be detected in all human heart RNA samples investigated. This splice variant was characterized structurally by a 40-amino acid deletion within the intracellular DII/DIII loop, and functionally by altered Na+ current amplitude and gating compared with wild-type Nav1.5. Moreover, structure-function analysis within the DII/DIII linker provides evidence for the importance of short sequence motifs for steady-state activation and inactivation of the human heart Na+ channel. Source of Human RNA and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA samples from whole human hearts were purchased from Invitrogen and from Stratagene. The RNA preparation from Invitrogen was obtained from a pool of eight male and female hearts (25-73 years; Fig. 1, lane 2). The samples from Stratagene were obtained from five male embryonic hearts (18 (two hearts), 19, 20, and 21 weeks) (Fig. 1, lane 3), from three female embryonic hearts (16, 20, and 22 weeks) (Fig. 1, lane 4), from a single male patient (72 years) (Fig. 1, lane 5), and from three adult female hearts (23, 27, and 48 years) (Fig. 1, lane 6). Reverse transcription was performed using an equimolar mix of the poly(A)-anchored oligonucleotides dTAN, dTCN, and dTGN and Superscript II according to the suggestions of the supplier (Invitrogen), followed by treatment of the cDNA mixture for 20 min at 37 °C with Escherichia coli RNase H (MBI Fermentas). Competitive PCRs and Product Quantification—The original cDNA mixtures were first prediluted 10-fold, and aliquots of these dilutions (0.5 μl) were used for the amplification reactions. Competitive PCRs were performed with Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the recommendation of the supplier. Cycle conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 58 °C for 1.5 min, extension at 72 °C for 3 min (30 cycles). Simultaneous amplification of the human Nav1.5 variants was carried out using forward primer 5′-AAAGAATTCTTCAGTGCAGACAACCTCAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAAGATGATGAATGTCTCGAACCA-3′, resulting in signals at 825 bp (Nav1.5) and 705 bp (Nav1.5d). Mouse Nav1.5 variants were amplified using forward primer 5′-GCCGTGGCTGAGTCAGACAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTGACCACCACCCGCATGCCCTCAAA-3′, resulting in signals at 823 bp (Nav1.5) and 664 bp (Nav1.5a). Nav1.5b was amplified only from the mouse heart cDNA and appeared as a faint band only after >35 cycles (not shown in this study; for Nav1.5b data, see Ref. 7Zimmer T. Bollensdorff C. Haufe V. Birch-Hirschfeld E. Benndorf K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1007-H1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Product quantification was done by determining the fluorescence intensities of bands of interest from an agarose gel (1%), using a CCD camera and the E.A.S.Y. Win32 software from Herolab (Wiesloch, Germany). In the present study, we always corrected the respective intensity values according to the product sizes in order to obtain the molar ratios. Controls included PCRs using total RNA preparations as templates to prove for a possible amplification of genomic DNA. The reliability of the assay conditions was tested by amplification of the Nav1.5 and Nav1.5d fragments using mixtures of respective plasmids, similarly as previously described (7Zimmer T. Bollensdorff C. Haufe V. Birch-Hirschfeld E. Benndorf K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1007-H1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Plasmids—Wild-type human Nav1.5 (hH1; kindly provided by Dr. George and Dr. Kallen) (20Gellens M.E. George A.L. Chen L. Chahine M. Horn R. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) was placed under the control of the SV40 promoter in expression plasmid pTSV40G-Nav1.5 by inserting its coding region as a HindIII/XbaI fragment into the Asp718/SpeI site of pTSV40G after Klenow treatment of the HindIII and Asp718 sites. Vector pTSV40G was obtained by exchanging the original coding region of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) 2The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; PKA, protein kinase A; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP; CaM, calmodulin. in pTracerSV40 (Invitrogen) by the coding region of the enhanced GFP from Clontech by means of PCR. Expression plasmids for splice variant Nav1.5d and all genetically modified variants were obtained by recombinant PCR as follows. We used specific primers to separately amplify hH1 nucleotide regions located directly upstream (1.1 kb) and downstream (1.8 kb) to the sequence that had to be deleted. Respective fragments were then assembled using a unique restriction site that was incorporated into the PCR primers. Finally, the resulting fragment was exchanged for the wild-type region in pTSV40G-Nav1.5 using the EcoRI/Asp718 sites in the human Nav1.5 sequence. For in vitro transcription, the coding region of all constructs were recloned into a pSP64Poly(A) vector (Promega) using the unique sites HindIII/XbaI. Plasmids for expression of Nav1.5-GFP and Nav1.5d-GFP in HEK293 cells were constructed as previously described (21Zimmer T. Biskup C. Dugarmaa S. Vogel F. Steinbis M. Bohle T. Wu Y.S. Dumaine R. Benndorf K. J. Membrane Biol. 2002; 186: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PfuTurbo DNA Polymerase (Stratagene) was used for all PCRs to minimize PCR-mediated nucleotide exchanges. Two independent PCR clones of each mutated Nav1.5 construct were tested in the heterologous expression system. The correctness of the DNA constructs was checked by the dideoxy-DNA sequencing method. Preparation, digestion, and ligation of DNA were carried out according to standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Heterologous Expression in HEK293 and Xenopus Oocytes—HEK293 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cells were transfected by a standard calcium phosphate precipitation method using 1-2 μg of plasmid DNA per transfection (60-mm cell culture dishes). After an incubation time of 24 h, the transfection mixture was removed, and the cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and cultured in fresh growth medium. Currents were investigated 24-48 h after transfection. Mexiletine treatment was done as recently described (23Keller D.I. Rougier J.S. Kucera J.P. Benammar N. Fressart V. Guicheney P. Madle A. Fromer M. Schlapfer J. Abriel H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated in mexiletine-containing medium (500 μm) for 24 h before measuring whole-cell currents. Preparation of oocytes from Xenopus laevis, in vitro transcription, and cRNA injection was done as previously described (24Zimmer T. Benndorf K. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the different cRNA samples were loaded onto an agarose gel, and relative fluorescence intensities of the bands were measured with the gel documentation system from Herolab (Wiesloch, Germany). The different cRNAs were diluted accordingly. Whole-cell currents in oocytes were between 0.4 and 5 μA. Laser-scanning Microscopy—Confocal imaging of HEK293 cells was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany), as previously described (21Zimmer T. Biskup C. Dugarmaa S. Vogel F. Steinbis M. Bohle T. Wu Y.S. Dumaine R. Benndorf K. J. Membrane Biol. 2002; 186: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—Recordings using HEK293 cells were performed with the patch clamp technique on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100, Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH, Germany), using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon-Instruments, Foster City, CA). The measurements were carried out at room temperature. Whole-cell currents were measured with standard techniques (25Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar). The bath solution contained 140.0 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10.0 mm glucose, 10.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.35 (CsOH). The pipette solution contained 10.0 mm NaCl, 130.0 mm CsCl, 10.0 mm EGTA, 10.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.35 (CsOH). Currents were elicited by test potentials from -120 to 40 mV in 10-mV increments at a pulsing frequency of 0.2 Hz. We used only cells that produced a peak current amplitude <5 nA. Steady-state activation (m∞) was evaluated by fitting the Boltzmann equation m∞ = (1 + exp(-(V - Vm)/s))-1 to the normalized conductance as a function of voltage. Steady-state inactivation (h∞) was determined with a double-pulse protocol consisting of 500-ms prepulses to voltages between -120 and -30 mV, followed by a constant test pulse of 10-ms duration to -10 mV at a pulsing frequency of 0.5 Hz. The amplitude of peak INa during the test pulse was normalized to the maximum peak current and plotted as function of the prepulse potential. Data were fitted to the Boltzmann equation h∞ = (1 + exp((V - Vh)/s))-1. V is the test potential, Vm and Vh are the midactivation and midinactivation potentials, respectively, and s is the slope factor in mV. Glass pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass, and their tips were heat-polished by the microforge MF 830 (Narishige, Japan). The pipette resistance was between 2 and 3 megaohms. Series resistance compensation was adjusted so that any oscillations were avoided, leaving at most 25% of the series resistance uncompensated. Currents were on-line filtered with a cut-off frequency of 10 kHz (4-pole Bessel). Recording and analysis of the data were performed on a personal computer with the ISO2 software (MFK, Niedernhausen, Germany). The sampling rate was 50 kHz. For mexiletine-treated HEK293 cells, anti-CD8 beads (Dynal) were used to identify transfected cells (23Keller D.I. Rougier J.S. Kucera J.P. Benammar N. Fressart V. Guicheney P. Madle A. Fromer M. Schlapfer J. Abriel H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In parallel experiments, we performed initial studies on Na+ channel subcellular localization, and therefore we used at the same time the yellow fluorescent protein-tagged channel variants for mexiletine treatment. As shown previously (21Zimmer T. Biskup C. Dugarmaa S. Vogel F. Steinbis M. Bohle T. Wu Y.S. Dumaine R. Benndorf K. J. Membrane Biol. 2002; 186: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), GFP/yellow fluorescent protein tagging does not alter Na+ channel properties. Patch clamp recordings were carried out using an internal solution containing 60.0 mm CsCl, 70.0 mm CsAsp, 11.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 10.0 mm HEPES, and 5.0 mm Na2ATP, pH 7.2 (CsOH). The external solution contained 130.0 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm CsCl, 10.0 mm HEPES, and 5.0 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (CsOH). The holding potential was -100 mV. For these whole-cell measurements, we used a VE-2 amplifier (Alembic Instruments). The resistance of the pipettes was between 1.5 and 3.0 megaohms. Single-channel recording was performed similarly as described previously (21Zimmer T. Biskup C. Dugarmaa S. Vogel F. Steinbis M. Bohle T. Wu Y.S. Dumaine R. Benndorf K. J. Membrane Biol. 2002; 186: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pipette resistance was between 10 and 50 megaohms when filled with the following solution: 140.0 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 4.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). The bath solution contained 140.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm EGTA, 10.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (KOH). Recordings were on-line filtered with a cut-off frequency of 5 kHz (4-pole Bessel). Whole-cell Na+ currents in oocytes were recorded with the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. The glass microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl. The microelectrode resistance was between 0.2 and 0.5 megaohms. The bath solution contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (KOH). The currents were elicited by test potentials from -80 to 40 mV in 5-mV increments from a holding potential of -120 mV. The pulsing frequency was 0.2 Hz. For stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA), 8-bromo-adenosine-3′-5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP; JenaBioscience) was added to the bath solution at a final concentration of 100 μm, similarly as described previously (26Zhou J. Yi J. Hu N. George A.L. Murray K.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Student's t test was used to test for statistical significance. Statistical significance was assumed for p < 0.05. Identification of a Novel Human Nav1.5 Splice Variant—Detection of the splice variant Nav1.5a in both rat and mouse (6Korsgaard M.P.G. Christophersen P. Ahring P.K. Olesen S.-P. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 443: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Zimmer T. Bollensdorff C. Haufe V. Birch-Hirschfeld E. Benndorf K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1007-H1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) suggested that alternative splicing of exon 18 of the cardiac Na+ channel is conserved among mammals. To test for the presence of Nav1.5a in the human heart, we purchased total RNA isolated from a pool of eight male and female hearts (25-73 years) and performed a respective reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Forward and reverse primers were specific for a region within the flanking exons 17 and 20, respectively. As a control, we first used a mouse heart cDNA library to reproduce the previously obtained Nav1.5 pattern (see Ref. 7Zimmer T. Bollensdorff C. Haufe V. Birch-Hirschfeld E. Benndorf K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1007-H1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (lane 1), the fragment corresponding to mouse Nav1.5 was most abundant (∼65%), followed by lower levels of Nav1.5a (∼35%). In the human heart, Nav1.5a was not detected (Fig. 1, lane 2). Instead, we found, in addition to the Nav1.5 signal, a band that was larger than splice variant Nav1.5a. Isolation of this fragment and sequencing analysis revealed a novel human Nav1.5 splice variant. We termed this splice variant Nav1.5d. It was characterized by an in-frame deletion of a 120-bp fragment of exon 17 (Fig. 2A). As further shown in Fig. 1, the level of Nav1.5d in the whole heart was relatively low (∼2-3% of Nav1.5). When investigating Nav1.5d levels in male and female hearts at two different developmental stages (embryonic, adult), we did not find significant differences in the Nav1.5/Nav1.5d ratio (Fig. 1, lanes 3-6). The fact that Nav1.5d appeared over a long range during ontogeny in both male and female hearts indicates that this splice variant is constantly produced in the human heart under normal physiological conditions. Interestingly, alternative splicing of Nav1.5 is species-dependent; we neither detected Nav1.5a in humans nor Nav1.5d in mice. Effect of Alternative Splicing on Whole-cell Currents—In order to investigate the functional consequences of the deletion in Nav1.5d, we expressed Nav1.5d heterologously in HEK293 cells and analyzed the whole-cell currents. Nav1.5d generated voltage-dependent Na+ currents that were markedly reduced compared with wild-type Nav1.5 (Fig. 3A). Because of the significant cell-to-cell variability of whole-cell currents often observed upon transient transfection, we verified functional surface expression in the Xenopus oocyte system. When injecting equal amounts of wild-type Nav1.5 and Nav1.5d cRNA, the whole-cell currents of Nav1.5d were reduced to a similar degree (Fig. 3B). This suggests that current reduction is caused neither by an insufficient transfection nor reduced transcription efficiency. Consequently, the reduction in current density can only be due to intrinsic properties of Nav1.5d in the plasma membrane or due to abnormal trafficking and reduced surface expression. Abnormal cardiac ion channel trafficking has previously been rescued pharmacologically or by temperature reduction (23Keller D.I. Rougier J.S. Kucera J.P. Benammar N. Fressart V. Guicheney P. Madle A. Fromer M. Schlapfer J. Abriel H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 27Valdivia C.R. Tester D.J. Rok B.A. Porter C.B. Munger T.M. Jahangir A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not Nav1.5d is a trafficking-deficient splice variant, we tested the effect of mexiletine, a Na+ channel blocker that is capable to restore a deficient trafficking phenotype (27Valdivia C.R. Tester D.J. Rok B.A. Porter C.B. Munger T.M. Jahangir A. Makielski J.C. Ackerman M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 62: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, a 24-h mexiletine treatment of Nav1.5d channels in HEK293 cells did not produce whole-cell currents that were comparable with those generated by wild-type Nav1.5. The drug enhanced cell surface expression in both Nav1.5 (1.9-fold) and Nav1.5d (2.6-fold). Similar data were obtained when expressing the channels at a lower temperature (28 °C) in HEK293 cells; Nav1.5d currents remained significantly smaller compared with Nav1.5 (data not shown). Oocyte expression was also performed at a low temperature (18 °C), and as shown in Fig. 3B, currents remained significantly lower in Nav1.5d compared with Nav1.5. Finally, we tested whether or not PKA differentially modulates surface expression of both channels. It has been shown previously that PKA enhanced trafficking of the human cardiac Na+ channel in Xenopus oocytes (26Zhou J. Yi J. Hu N. George A.L. Murray K.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We speculated that the loss of the potential PKA site in Nav1.5d (Fig. 2B) may underlie this current decrease and that a PKA-dependent activation of channel trafficking occurs only in Nav1.5 and not in Nav1.5d channels. We added 8-Br-cAMP, a membrane-permeable PKA activator, to the bath solution of injected oocytes and determined peak Na+ currents by the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Current mediated by Nav1.5d channels could be increased similarly to the wild-type current (Fig. 4B). This indicates that the potential PKA site in the DII/DIII linker of Nav1.5 is not responsible for the PKA-mediated rise in Na+ current and suggests that reduced whole-cell currents in Nav1.5d are not due to the lack of the potential PKA site i"
https://openalex.org/W2088972209,"The GTP hydrolytic (GTPase) reaction terminates signaling by both large (heterotrimeric) and small (Ras-related) GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). Two residues that are necessary for GTPase activity are an arginine (often called the “arginine finger”) found either in the Switch I domains of the α subunits of large G proteins or contributed by the GTPase-activating proteins of small G proteins, and a glutamine that is highly conserved in the Switch II domains of Gα subunits and small G proteins. However, questions still exist regarding the mechanism of the GTPase reaction and the exact role played by the Switch II glutamine. Here, we have characterized the GTP binding and GTPase activities of mutants in which the essential arginine or glutamine residue has been changed within the background of a Gα chimera (designated αT*), comprised mainly of the α subunit of retinal transducin (αT) and the Switch III region from the α subunit of Gi1. As expected, both the αT*(R174C) and αT*(Q200L) mutants exhibited severely compromised GTPase activity. Neither mutant was capable of responding to aluminum fluoride when monitoring changes in the fluorescence of Trp-207 in Switch II, although both stimulated effector activity in the absence of rhodopsin and Gβγ. Surprisingly, each mutant also showed some capability for being activated by rhodopsin and Gβγ to undergo GDP-[35S]GTPγS exchange. The ability of the mutants to couple to rhodopsin was not consistent with the assumption that they contained only bound GTP, prompting us to examine their nucleotide-bound states following their expression and purification from Escherichia coli. Indeed, both mutants contained bound GDP as well as GTP, with 35–45% of each mutant being isolated as GDP-Pi complexes. Overall, these findings suggest that the R174C and Q200L mutations reveal Gα subunit states that occur subsequent to GTP hydrolysis but are still capable of fully stimulating effector activity.

This is a highly sensitive signaling system, capable of detecting a single photon of light, which excites the seven-membrane spanning receptor, rhodopsin. Light-activated rhodopsin binds and activates the α subunit of transducin (αT) enabling it to bind GTP. Activated GTP-bound αT then stimulates PDE activity by altering the positions of its regulatory γ subunits (γPDE), thereby allowing its catalytic subunits (αPDE and βPDE) to hydrolyze cGMP. The reduction in the cellular levels of this second messenger causes cation-specific cGMP-gated ion channels in the outer segments to close, leading to the hyperpolarization of rod outer segment membranes and the generation of the visual response. There is an amplification of the signal at every step of this cascade such that a single photon of light can lead to the inhibition of 106-107 Na+ ions from entering the rod cell (1Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1994; 76: 201-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Members of the family of large G proteins are made up of three distinct subunits: α (39–46 kDa), β (36 kDa), and γ (8 kDa), with β and γ remaining tightly associated under all non-denaturing conditions (often referred to as the Gβγ complex). The N-terminal region of Gα subunits, together with the C-terminal region of Gγ subunits, have lipid modifications and are involved in membrane attachment (1Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1994; 76: 201-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 3Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). G proteins are inactive and unable to propagate signals when their α subunits are in the GDP-bound state. Receptor-catalyzed exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit can lead to the dissociation of the Gβγ complex from the GTP-bound Gα subunit, allowing both Gα and Gβγ to engage downstream effectors. The GTPase reaction terminates the signaling functions of large as well as small G proteins by acting as an internal clock, which controls the activated lifetime of the G protein and its associated physiological response. Among the more fundamentally important but still unanswered questions regarding G protein function concerns the steps that underlie the GTPase reaction and signal termination. Two residues have been consistently implicated as being important in the GTPase reaction (4Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A.

Biol. 1998; 5: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). One is a conserved arginine residue, often referred to as the “arginine finger,” that is found either in the helical domain/Switch I region of the Gα subunits of large G proteins or contributed in trans by GTPase-activating proteins for small G proteins (5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). This arginine residue is ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin in the Gsα subunit, resulting in an inhibition of GTPase activity and constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase (7Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). The other frequently implicated residue is the highly conserved glutamine found in the Switch II regions of both large and small G proteins. Mutations of this glutamine residue in Ras (Gln-61) have been detected in human tumors and are carried by some animal retroviruses (7Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 8Der C.J. Finkel T. Cooper G.M. Cell. 1986; 44: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Moreover, a variety of human tumors have been associated with mutations of either the Switch II glutamine or the arginine finger in the Gs and Gi proteins (7Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 9Bourne H.R. Nature. 1987; 330: 517-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Weinstein L.S. Shenker A. Gejman P.V. Merino M.J. Friedman E. Spiegel A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 1688-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). Although there seems little doubt that these two residues have important roles in the GTPase reactions of both large and small G proteins, there are questions regarding exactly how they participate in the catalytic mechanism and whether they serve the same function in all G proteins. Much of what has been proposed regarding the functions of these residues comes from the x-ray crystal structures of Gα subunits bound to AlF–4, as well as from the corresponding structures for ternary complexes formed between small G proteins, AlF3, and GTPase-activating proteins, as these have been proposed to mimic the transition state for the GTPase reaction (4Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 6Nassar N. Hoffman G.R. Manor D. Clardy J.C. Cerione R.A. Nat. Struct.

Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Based on these structures, it has been suggested that the positively charged arginine residue stabilizes negative charges that develop on GTP during the transition state for the GTPase reaction (12Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 13Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), whereas the Switch II glutamine residue was originally suggested to be responsible for correctly positioning the water molecule for nucleophilic attack (13Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and to act as a general base catalyst for the hydrolytic reaction. However, more recent studies have called some of these suggestions into question. For example, mutations of the conserved Switch II glutamine residue in Ras (Gln-61) did not alter the position of the bound water (14Prive G.G. Milburn M.V. Tong L. de Vos A.M. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and when substituted with an unnatural amino acid (i.e. a nitro-analog of glutamine), which is a much weaker base compared with glutamine itself, there was little effect on GTP hydrolysis (15Chung H.H. Benson D.R. Schultz P.G. Science. 1993; 259: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, computer simulations have demonstrated that Gln-61 is unlikely to serve as the general base (16Langen R. Schweins T. Warshel A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8691-8696Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and recently it has been argued that GTP hydrolysis occurs by substrate-assisted catalysis, with the γ-phosphate of GTP serving as the general base catalyst (17Pasqualato S. Cherfils J. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 533-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the original motivation for these studies was to further examine the roles played by the conserved arginine and glutamine residues in the GTP-binding/GTPase cycles of large G proteins. Mutations of Arg-174 to cysteine and Gln-200 to leucine were made in the background of an αT/αi1 chimera that contained wild-type αT residues except in the Switch III domain where residues 215–294 were from αi1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). This chimera, designated from here on as αT*, was used because, unlike wild-type αT, it can be readily expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and retains the ability to undergo rhodopsin- and Gβγ-promoted GDP-GTP exchange and to activate the cGMP PDE. During the course of these studies, we obtained some interesting new insights regarding the individual steps comprising the activation (GDP-GTP exchange)-deactivation (GTPase) cycles of large G proteins. As expected, we found that both the R174C and Q200L mutants exhibited severely compromised rates of GTP hydrolysis and were unable to assume an AlF–4-induced transition state conformation. Consequently, these αT* mutants were capable of constitutively stimulating PDE activity (i.e. without the addition of light-activated rhodopsin, Gβγ, and GTP). All of these findings were consistent with our initial assumption that both the R174C and Q200L mutants were isolated in the GTP-bound state. However, surprisingly, we found that a fraction of each mutant was capable of responding to rhodopsin and Gβγ to undergo GDP-GTP exchange. This seemed inconsistent with the idea that the R174C and Q200L mutants, upon isolation, existed entirely in the GTP-bound state. Indeed, we found that a significant percentage of each mutant contained bound GDP with a sizeable fraction also containing inorganic phosphate (Pi) and thus existed as GDP-Pi complexes. Given that each mutant was able to fully activate PDE with a dose-response profile essentially indistinguishable from wild-type αT*, all three forms of the R174C and Q200L mutants (GTP-bound, GDP-bound, and GDP-Pi complexes) must represent signaling-competent conformations. Thus, these findings highlight the existence of conformational states that occur subsequent to the GTP hydrolytic reaction (representing GDP-Pi and GDP-bound forms of Gα subunits) and are still capable of regulating target/effectors. They also demonstrate for the first time that the conserved arginine and glutamine residues are not only necessary for the actual GTP hydrolytic step but also contribute to product (Pi) release and influence the rate at which these different conformational states are converted back to the signaling-inactive GDP-bound state. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were synthesized with the desired mutated base in the center of the primer. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to carry out the PCR-based mutagenesis on miniprep plasmid DNA. The parental DNA template was digested using DpnI endonuclease, and the nicked vector DNA with the desired mutation was transformed into Epicurian Coli XL-1 Blue supercompetent cells. DNA was purified from single colonies using the Qiagen plasmid miniprep kit. The DNA was sequenced at the Bio Resource Center, Cornell University. Construction of the αT* Chimera—The bovine retinal αT subunit, when expressed in E. coli, is not soluble, whereas the Gαi1 subunit is soluble and fully functional. There are several αi1 and αT chimeras available, which can be expressed in E. coli and bind GTP similar to retinal αT but are unable to stimulate the cyclic GMP PDE (18Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have used a construct designated pHis6Chi6, which was obtained from Dr. Heidi Hamm (Vanderbilt University). This chimera, which has the corresponding region from αi1 inserted between residues 215 and 294 of αT, is unable to stimulate PDE activity but is capable of binding to γPDE. By changing residues 244 and 247 back to the original amino acids in αT, the ability to stimulate PDE activity was restored to at least 50% of the levels obtained with retinal αT. This form of transducin has been designated αT*. The R174C and Q200L mutants have been made in the αT* background. Protein Expression and Purification—The recombinant wild-type αT* subunit and the αT* mutants were expressed in BL21 (DE3) supercompetent cells and purified as described (18Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Majumdar S. Ramachandran S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40137-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The proteins were further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 75 HR26/60 column equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm NaN3. The samples were aliquotted, snap-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. The final yield of chimeric αT* was typically ∼5 mg of pure protein/liter of bacterial culture. Purification of Retinal Proteins—Frozen, dark-adapted bovine retina were obtained from W. L. Lawson Co. (Lincoln, NE). Holo-transducin and PDE were purified from rod outer segment membranes as outlined in (20Phillips W.J. Trukawinski S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16679-16688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PDE was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 200 HR26/60 column equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol. Holo-transducin was loaded onto a Blue-Sepharose column (21Pines M. Gierschik P. Milligan G. Klee W. Spiegel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4095-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to separate the Gβγ subunit complex from αT, as follows. Concentrated holo-transducin was applied to a 50-ml Blue-Sepharose column that had been pre-equilibrated with G1G0A buffer (10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol). The column was washed with 250 ml of the above buffer followed by a 250-ml low salt wash (G1G0A buffer + 100 mm KCl) to elute the Gβγ complex. The bound αT was eluted from the column with 250 ml of high salt buffer (G1G0A buffer + 500 mm KCl). The αT and Gβγ subunits were further purified by a final round of gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 75 HR26/60 column. The samples were aliquotted, snap-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. The final yield of each subunit ranged from 3 to 5 mg of pure protein/300 retinas. Urea-washed rod outer segment membranes highly enriched in rhodopsin were prepared as previously described (22Min K.C. Gravina S.A. Sakmar T.P. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the rhodopsin was solubilized in 0.01% dodecyl maltoside (from here on referred to simply as rhodopsin). [35S]GTPγS Binding Assays—Light-activated rhodopsin (R*), together with αT* and the Gβγ complex, was incubated in HMDM buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% dodecyl maltoside) for 20 min at room temperature and in room light. [35S]GTPγS (final concentration = 1 μm; specific activity = 1 Ci/mmol) was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was quenched by direct application to prewetted nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell, pore size = 0.45 μm) on a suction manifold. The filters were washed twice with HM buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2), added to scintillation liquid (30% LSC Scintisafe Mixture), and counted in a scintillation counter (LS6500 multipurpose scintillation counter). Measurements of cGMP PDE Activity—The analysis of cGMP hydrolysis by the retinal PDE was carried out as outlined in Ref. 23Liebman P.A. Evanczuk A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar. A pH microelectrode was used to measure the decrease in pH (in millivolts) that results from the release of one proton for each molecule of cGMP hydrolyzed by PDE. In a typical assay, αT* was preincubated with Gβγ, R*, GTPγS and PDE in a buffer containing 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside, at room temperature and in room light for 60 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate, cGMP, to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the change in pH was monitored over time. At the end of the assay period (100 s), the buffering capacity (mV/nmol) was determined by the addition of 0.1 mol of NaOH to the reaction mixture. The rate of hydrolysis of cGMP (nmol/s) was determined from the ratio of the slope of the pH record (mV/s) and the buffering capacity of the assay buffer (mV/nmol). GTPase Assays—Light-activated rhodopsin, αT*, and Gβγ were incubated in HMDM buffer for 20 min at room temperature and in room light. The assays were initiated by the addition of [γ32P]GTP (final concentration = 1 μm; specific activity = 13 Ci/mmol). Aliquots (40 μl) were removed at specific time points and added to 1 ml of 5% activated charcoal (neutralized) in 50 mm NaH2PO4. The samples were centrifuged at high speed, and then an aliquot of the supernatant (100 μl) was added to scintillation fluid and counted. Fluorescence Measurements—The binding of aluminum fluoride (AlF–4) as well as GTPγS was measured by monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of αT* upon excitation at 300 nm and emission at 345 nm (24Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4888-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In the experiments examining the effects of AlF–4, 300 nm αT* was preincubated in HM buffer at room temperature. The tryptophan fluorescence emission of αT* was monitored for 1 min, at which time AlF–4 (prepared by mixing 250 mm NaF and 150 μm AlCl3) was added. A similar procedure was used for the GTPγS-binding experiments, where 300 nm αT* was preincubated with Gβγ and R* in HMDM buffer at room temperature, for 10 min. The fluorescence measurements were carried out using a Varian eclipse spectrofluorometer. Trypsin Proteolysis—The patterns of tryptic proteolysis were determined as previously described (26Fung B.K. Nash C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The αT* subunit (10 μg) was treated with/without AlF–4 for 30 min at room temperature. The protein was then mixed with 0.1 μgof l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Digestion was terminated by the addition of 0.2 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor, followed by SDS sample buffer and then boiled for 5 min. The proteolytic fragments were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15%) electrophoresis (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. HPLC Analysis—The nucleotide analyses were performed using a Sunfire C-18 reversed phase column (0.46 × 25 cm) filled with 5 μm (particle size) silica (Waters). The system consisted of a Waters 1525 Binary HPLC pump machine and a Waters 2487 dual absorbance UV detector. The column was equilibrated with 100 mm KH2P04, pH 6.5, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide, 0.2% NaN3, and 7.5% acetonitrile, and isocratic elution was performed at ambient temperature with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. In this system, the order of elution of guanine nucleotides was GMP, GDP, and GTP (retention times 4.8, 8, and 14 min, respectively). In a typical experiment, 100 μm αT* was boiled for 3 min at 95 °C and centrifuged at high speed for 10 min to remove denatured protein. An aliquot of the supernatant (20 μl) was injected into the column. The column was calibrated with 100 μm solutions of the different guanine nucleotides. Inorganic Phosphate Assays—Free inorganic phosphate (Pi) bound to the different αT* subunits was measured by performing a PiPer phosphate assay (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen P22061). In the presence of inorganic phosphate, maltose phosphorylase converts maltose to glucose 1-phosphate and glucose. Glucose oxidase then converts glucose to gluconolactone and H2O2, and horseradish peroxidase catalyzes the reaction of H2O2 with Amplex Red reagent to generate the chromophore resorufin. The resulting increase in absorption is proportional to the amount of Pi in the sample. The αT* samples were prepared by boiling as described in the preceding section. Following centrifugation to remove denatured protein, an aliquot from the supernatant was added to the PiPer phosphate assay reagents to yield a final concentration of 10 μm αT*. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 60 min at 37 °C, and then the generation of resorufin was monitored by measuring its absorption at 565 nm. The αT*(R174C) and αT*(Q200L) Mutants Are Unable to Stabilize the Transition State for the GTPase Reaction—Both the conserved arginine residue in Switch I (Arg-174 in αT) and the conserved glutamine residue in Switch II (Gln-200 inαT) have been suggested to play important roles in the GTPase reactions of large G proteins, as have the corresponding residues in small G proteins (4Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 6Nassar N. Hoffman G.R. Manor D. Clardy J.C. Cerione R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We further verified that this was the case for the αT* subunit by performing GTPase assays, monitoring the release of 32Pi (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the presence of light-activated rhodopsin (R*) and the Gβγ subunit complex, the E. coli recombinant αT* subunit, following the exchange of GDP for [γ-32P]GTP, exhibited GTPase activity with turnover numbers in the range of 1–4/min, similar to the values measured for native retinal αT (28Guy P.M. Koland J.G. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6954-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, under the same assay conditions, the R174C and Q200L mutants showed extremely low levels of GTPase activity (Fig. 1), such that the amount of 32Pi released after 1 h was not significantly higher than the background levels obtained when αT* was assayed in the absence of rhodopsin. Similar results were also obtained when the R174C and Q200L mutants were preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP, prior to assaying single-turnover GTP hydrolysis (data not shown). It has been proposed that aluminum fluoride induces conformational changes within G proteins that mimic their transition state for the GTPase reaction (4Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 6Nassar N. Hoffman G.R. Manor D. Clardy J.C. Cerione R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These conformational changes occur within seconds and, in the case of αT*, can be monitored in real time by an increase in Trp-207 fluorescence. An example is shown in Fig. 2. Both the αT*(Q200L) mutant and the αT*(R174C) mutant were incapable of undergoing an AlF–4-induced conformational change. These findings are in line with the x-ray crystal structures for Gα-GDP-AlF–4 complexes showing that both the Gln-200 and Arg-174 residues contact AlF–4 (4Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and so substitutions at these sites would be expected to severely compromise the stabilization of the transition state complex for the GTPase reaction. The αT* (R174C) and αT* (Q200L) Mutants Are Capable of Stimulating the Effector Enzyme, the Cyclic GMP PDE in the Absence of Rhodopsin, Gβγ, and GTPγS—Fig. 3 shows the results of experiments comparing the abilities of the αT* subunit and the αT*(R174C) and αT*(Q200L) mutants to stimulate cyclic GMP hydrolysis by the PDE. Whereas wild-type αT* was only able to stimulate PDE activity in the presence of R* and Gβγ, and upon the addition of GTPγS, both the R174C and Q200L mutants appeared to be capable of maximally stimulating the PDE, even in the absence of R*, Gβγ, and GTPγS (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows the dose-response profiles for the different αT* subunits. Each mutant, in the absence of R* and Gβγ (as well as GTPγS), was as potent as rhodopsin- and Gβγ-activated wild-type αT* in stimulating the PDE. These results indicated that changing either Arg-174 or Gln-200 did not compromise the binding and regulation of the target/effector by αT* and that the mutants were constitutively active in stimulating the effector enzyme. Trypsin-proteolysis Profiles for the αT*(R174C) and αT*(Q200L) Mutants Differ from Those for Activated αT*—The susceptibility of Gα subunits to trypsin proteolysis offers a sensitive assay for monitoring conformational changes in Switch II that have been correlated with activation (26Fung B."
https://openalex.org/W2003746081,"The septation initiation network (SIN) serves to coordinate cytokinesis with mitotic exit in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. SIN components Spg1 and Cdc7 together play a central role in regulating the onset of septation and cytokinesis. Spg1, a Ras-like GTPase, localizes to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) throughout the cell cycle. It is converted to its GTP-bound (active) state during mitosis, only to become inactivated at one SPB during anaphase and at both SPBs as cells exit mitosis. Cdc7 functions as an effector kinase for Spg1, binding to Spg1 in its GTP-bound state, and therefore is present at both SPBs during mitosis and asymmetrically at only one during anaphase. Interestingly, the kinase activity of Cdc7 does not vary across the cell cycle, suggesting the possibility that Cdc7 kinase activity is independent of Spg1 binding. Consistent with this, we found that Cdc7 associates with Spg1 only during mitosis. To learn more about the essential role of Cdc7 kinase in the SIN and its regulation, we undertook a structure/function analysis and identified independent functional domains within Cdc7. We found that a region adjacent to the kinase domain is responsible for Spg1 association and identified an overlapping but distinct SPB localization domain. In addition Cdc7 associates with itself and exists as a dimer in vivo. The septation initiation network (SIN) serves to coordinate cytokinesis with mitotic exit in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. SIN components Spg1 and Cdc7 together play a central role in regulating the onset of septation and cytokinesis. Spg1, a Ras-like GTPase, localizes to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) throughout the cell cycle. It is converted to its GTP-bound (active) state during mitosis, only to become inactivated at one SPB during anaphase and at both SPBs as cells exit mitosis. Cdc7 functions as an effector kinase for Spg1, binding to Spg1 in its GTP-bound state, and therefore is present at both SPBs during mitosis and asymmetrically at only one during anaphase. Interestingly, the kinase activity of Cdc7 does not vary across the cell cycle, suggesting the possibility that Cdc7 kinase activity is independent of Spg1 binding. Consistent with this, we found that Cdc7 associates with Spg1 only during mitosis. To learn more about the essential role of Cdc7 kinase in the SIN and its regulation, we undertook a structure/function analysis and identified independent functional domains within Cdc7. We found that a region adjacent to the kinase domain is responsible for Spg1 association and identified an overlapping but distinct SPB localization domain. In addition Cdc7 associates with itself and exists as a dimer in vivo. Cell division is a fundamental biological event that underlies the growth and development of all organisms. Critical events in the process of cell division include DNA replication, mitosis (where genetic material is faithfully segregated), and cytokinesis (which results in the actual separation of daughter cells). In a normal cell cycle, cytokinesis takes place only after chromosome segregation has been completed, thus safeguarding genomic integrity. A failure to temporally and spatially regulate this event is catastrophic for the cell, resulting in aneuploidy, cell death, or cancer (1Guertin D.A. Trautmann S. McCollum D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 155-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Conserved GTPase-driven signaling pathways have emerged that serve to coordinate mitotic exit with cytokinesis (2Krapp A.

Loss of function mutations in sin genes result in elongated multinucleate cells due to continuation of nuclear division and cell growth in the absence of deposition of septal material (2Krapp A.

In contrast, hyperactivation of the SIN (caused by mutations in inhibitors of SIN activity) leads to formation of multiple septa without cell separation. SIN components include a GTPase Spg1 (4Balasubramanian M.K. McCollum D. Chang L. Wong K.C. Naqvi N.I. He X. Sazer S. Gould K.L.

All SIN components reside on the SPB either constitutively or transiently at some stage during the cell cycle. Two proteins, Sid4 and Cdc11, function together as a platform to assemble the SIN and its regulators on the SPB (13Chang L. Gould K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5249-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Krapp A. Schmidt S. Cano E. Simanis V. Curr.

FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) analysis of SIN components demonstrate that Sid4 and Cdc11 are stable proteins, as opposed to the regulatory molecules Spg1 and Sid2, which are extremely dynamic (16Morrell J.L. Tomlin G.C. Rajagopalan S. Venkatram S. Feoktistova A.S. Tasto J.J. Mehta S. Jennings J.L. Link A. Balasubramanian M.K. Gould K.L. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 579-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These findings further support the role for Sid4-Cdc11 in serving as a scaffold to which other SIN components associate dynamically. Cdc7 is a member of the STE11/MEKK family of kinases (17Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 18Smith C.M. Shindyalov I.N. Veretnik S. Gribskov M. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Bourne P.E. Trends Biochem.

Prigent C. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Most kinases belonging to the MEKK family share a similar structure with the kinase domain at the C terminus and a regulatory domain at the N terminus (21Hagemann C. Blank J.L. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). They also have been shown to bind to small G-proteins (21Hagemann C. Blank J.L. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cdc7 differs from the typical member of the family in that the kinase domain of Cdc7 resides at its N terminus. However, like other family members, it binds to and is an effector for a GTPase, in this case Spg1 (5Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Activation of the SIN pathway is triggered by activation of Spg1, and increased production of Spg1 leads to the formation of septa at any point in the cell cycle (5Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Spg1 activation at the SPB is asymmetric. It exists in the GDP-bound state during interphase at the single SPB, and during metaphase it is GTP-bound at both SPBs only to be “inactivated” or GDP-bound at one SPB during anaphase B (22Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cdc7 is only recruited to the pole that is occupied by GTP-bound Spg1; hence it also is asymmetrically localized during anaphase. The asymmetric localization of SIN components appears to be important for proper SIN regulation, because Cdc7 is associated with both SPBs during anaphase in cells with deregulated septum formation (7Tanaka K. Petersen J. MacIver F. Mulvihill D.P. Glover D.M. Hagan I.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1259-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Mulvihill D.P. Petersen J. Ohkura H. Glover D.M. Hagan I.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2771-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cdc7 kinase plays a crucial role in propagation of the SIN, as it serves to relay the activation signal from Spg1-GTP to its downstream effectors. To understand how Cdc7 is regulated we have carried out a detailed structure/function analysis of Cdc7. We have mapped the regions within Cdc7 required for SPB localization as well as binding to Spg1. Additionally we found that Cdc7 self-associates via an intermolecular interaction. Yeast Strains, Media, and Genetic Methods—S. pombe strains used in this study (Table 1) were grown in yeast extract or minimal medium with appropriate supplements (24Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar). DNA transformations were done by electroporation (25Prentice H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 621Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) or lithium acetate transformation. Regulated expression of genes from various strengths of the nmt promoter in the pREP series of vectors was achieved by growth in the presence of thiamine (promoter repressed) and then removing the thiamine by washing into medium lacking thiamine (promoter nonrepressed) (26Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene. 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PJ69-4A was used for two-hybrid analysis (27James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transformed by a lithium acetate method (28Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). leu+trp+ transformants were scored for positive interactions by plating on synthetic dextrose medium lacking adenine and histidine. β-Galactosidase reporter enzyme activity in the two-hybrid strains was measured using the Galacto-Star chemiluminescent reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) with the exception that cells were lysed by glass bead disruption. Each sample was measured in triplicate.TABLE 1Strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeRef. no./sourceKGY246h- ade6-M210 ura4-D18 leu1-32Paul NurseaRockerfeller University, New York.KGY4071h- spg1-myc::KanR ade6-M210 ura4-D18 leu1-32This studyKGY3842h- cdc7-myc::KanR ade6-M210 ura4-D18 leu1-32This studyKGY2061h- cdc7-24 ade6-M21X ura4-D18 leu1-32Paul NurseaRockerfeller University, New York.KGY2678h+ spg1-GFP::KanR ade6-M210 ura4-D18 leu1-3215Tomlin G.C.

Open table in a new tab Molecular Biology Techniques—For yeast two-hybrid analysis or yeast expression, the indicated regions of cdc7+ were amplified by PCR with primers containing 5′ and 3′ restriction sites and cloned in-frame into pGBT9 or pGAD424 (for yeast two-hybrid) or pREP vectors. PCR amplifications were carried out with TaqPlus Precision polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA. Full-length spg1+ and the region of cdc7+ encoding amino acids 250–535 were amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) and pET15-b (Novagen) to create GST-Spg1 and His6-Cdc7-(250–535), respectively. Spg1Q69L and Spg1T42A mutants were created by Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro and Lysate Binding Assays—His6-Cdc7-(250–535) was produced from bacterial cell lysates and purified over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Qiagen) according to manufacturers instructions. GST, GST-Spg1Q69L, and GST-Spg1T42A were purified as described previously (16Morrell J.L. Tomlin G.C. Rajagopalan S. Venkatram S. Feoktistova A.S. Tasto J.J. Mehta S. Jennings J.L. Link A. Balasubramanian M.K. Gould K.L. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 579-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed against native binding buffer (NBB: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). 150 μm GST-Spg1Q69L or GST-Spg1T42A was mixed with 200 μm His6-Cdc7-(250–535), and the volume was brought up to 1.0 ml using NBB. The proteins were allowed to bind in solution at 4 °C for 1 h. GST-Spg1 proteins were pulled down by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads for 40 min, washed several times with NBB, and washed once with NBB containing 250 mm salt. GST-Spg1 and associated proteins were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For lysate binding experiments GST and GST-Spg1 proteins were left bound to glutathione-agarose beads. S. pombe lysates were prepared as described below, except the Nonidet P-40 buffer was supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 50 μm GTP. Bound proteins were eluted from beads by incubating in GST elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 μm GTP and 100 mm Glutathione) for 1 h at 4 °C. Eluate was then either immunoblotted or subjected to immunoprecipitation as described below. Immunoprecipitations, Sucrose Gradients, and Immunoblots—Whole cell S. pombe lysates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 buffer (29Gould K.L. Moreno S. Owen D.J. Sazer S. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3297-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitations were carried out using either anti-HA (12CA5), anti-Myc (9E10), or polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies as described (30McDonald W.H. Ohi R. Smelkova N. Frendewey D. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5352-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were run on a 4–12% NuPAGE in MOPS buffer. For sucrose gradient analysis, a 200-μl volume of protein lysate was layered onto a 5-ml 5–20% sucrose gradient prepared in Nonidet P-40 buffer. Gradients were ultracentrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 19 h in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor (Berkeley, CA). Sedimentation markers were fractionated on gradients prepared and spun in parallel. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient, resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred by electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was done with anti-HA (12CA5; 2 mg/ml), anti-Myc (9E10; 2 mg/ml), or anti-GFP (1:1000 dilution of serum) antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (0.4 mg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:50,000, visualized by ECL using SuperSignal (Pierce). For Figs. 1 and 4C immunoblotting was performed using the Odyssey infrared imaging system and protocol (LI-COR). Goat anti-mouse Alexa® 680 (LI-COR) was used at a 1:5000 dilution.

Portions of the beads (b) and the eluate (e) were run on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted with anti-Myc to detect proteins bound to Spg1 and with anti-GST to detect recombinant proteins, as indicated.

Images were processed using Volocity software (v1.4.2; Improvision, Lexington, MA). Cdc7 Associates with Spg1 Only during Mitosis—Cdc7 has been shown to associate with GTP-bound but not GDP-bound Spg1 and is presumed to function as its effector. Most G-protein effector kinases are activated upon binding to their cognate G-proteins (31Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 32Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the kinase activity of Cdc7 has been shown to remain constant throughout the cell cycle despite the observation that Spg1 is in its GTP-bound form at the SPB only during mitosis (22Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Given this anomaly, we decided to address whether Cdc7 is always associated with Spg1 even when not at the SPB. We generated a synchronous population of cells by centrifugal elutriation that produced endogenously tagged Cdc7-Myc13 and Spg1-HA3. Samples were collected at regular intervals and examined for septation and nuclear division as indicators of the cell-cycle stage (Fig. 1A). Protein lysates were prepared, and the presence of Cdc7-Myc13 in Spg1 immunoprecipitates was assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). A control spg1-HA3 strain lacking endogenously tagged Cdc7 and a wild type untagged strain were used as controls. A small percentage of Cdc7-Myc13 was present in Spg1-HA3 immunoprecipitates prepared from mitotic (at minutes 30, 45, and 60) but not from interphase cells. This is also the stage at which Spg1 is in its GTP-bound form (22Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In uninucleate cells that exited from mitosis (at minutes 90, 105 and 120), no Cdc7-Myc13 was detectable. Lack of Spg1-HA3-Cdc7-Myc13 association was not due to lower amounts of Spg1-HA3 in immunoprecipitates, higher concentrations of Cdc7-Myc13 in mitotic samples (Fig. 1B, bottom panel), or higher overall protein levels (Fig. 1B, top panel). Taken at face value, these results indicate that unlike in other G-protein-associated kinases, the binding to Spg1 does not influence Cdc7 kinase activity. The N Terminus of Cdc7 Contains an Spg1 Binding Site—Given that the association of Cdc7 with Spg1 at the SPB is a likely SIN-activating step, we addressed what regions of Cdc7 are responsible for binding to Spg1. We first analyzed a series of cdc7 fragments in a directed two-hybrid assay. Residues 250–535 were found to contain a strong interaction domain (Fig. 2A). Because Cdc7 only associates with Spg1 in its GTP-bound form (22Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we tested whether His6-Cdc7-(250–535) bound Spg1 in a nucleotide-dependent manner. For this we examined the ability of bacterially produced His6-Cdc7-(250–535) to interact with recombinant Spg1 mutants in vitro. His6-Cdc7-(250–535) was able to bind GST-Spg1Q69L, a constitutively active mutant (5Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), but not GST-Spg1T42A, an effector domain mutant (5Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). We also tested whether Cdc7-(250–535) and Spg1-Myc13 could co-immunoprecipitate from S. pombe protein lysates. To this end, GFP-tagged Cdc7-(250–535) was overproduced in a spg1-myc13 strain. Anti-GFP immunoprecipitates contained Spg1-Myc13 (Fig. 2C), confirming that residues 250–535 of Cdc7 were sufficient to interact with Spg1. We noticed that when GFP-Cdc7-(250–535) was overproduced, it generated a SIN phenotype (Fig. 2D). This could be because it prevented endogenous Cdc7 from localizing to the poles and thus from binding Spg1 or because it titrated Spg1 from the SPBs. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we first examined the localization of GFP-Cdc7-(250–535) when it was overproduced. Inconsistent with the first possibility, GFP-Cdc7-(250–535) localized to the cytosol (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, overproduction of Cdc7-(250–535) displaced endogenous Spg1-GFP from the SPB (Fig. 2E). The SPB itself was intact under these conditions, because the localization of the SIN anchor Sid4-GFP and the downstream SIN component Sid2-GFP, which dynamically associates with Cdc11, were unaffected (Fig. 2E). These data taken together indicate that amino acids 250–535 of Cdc7 are sufficient for binding to Spg1 in vitro and in vivo and, when present in sufficient quantity, to sequester Spg1 away from SPBs. Further, these results indicate that Cdc7 residues outside of its Spg1 binding domain are required for Cdc7 localization to the SPB. Amino Acid Residues 360–870 Mediate SPB Localization of Cdc7—To determine which region(s) of Cdc7 target it to the SPB, we expressed N- and C-terminal truncations of Cdc7 fused to GFP. Because Cdc7 is an essential gene we tested these truncations in cells that also contained endogenous Cdc7. Full-length GFP-Cdc7 localized to the SPB in a cell cycle-dependent manner. However, unlike endogenous Cdc7, it localized to the SPB symmetrically during anaphase, as has been noted previously when Cdc7 is overexpressed (22Sohrmann M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A kinase-dead mutant of Cdc7, GFP-Cdc7K38R, and also GFP-Cdc7-(250–1062) and GFP-Cdc7-(360–1062) constructs lacking the kinase domain were capable of localizing to the SPB (Fig. 3). Hence, neither the kinase domain nor kinase activity is required for Cdc7 SPB localization. We next tested C-terminal truncations to narrow the region responsible for Cdc7 SPB localization. Although GFP-Cdc7-(360–870) could localize to the SPB, further loss of N- or C-terminal residues resulted in abrogation of SPB localization (Fig. 3B). Hence the region that is responsible for SPB association resides within residues Cdc7-(360–870). To correlate the ability of Cdc7 constructs to localize and bind Spg1 with overall Cdc7 function, GFP-Cdc7 truncation mutants were tested for the ability to rescue growth of cdc7–24 cells at 36 °C (Fig. 3A). Full-length and C-terminally truncated GFP-Cdc7-(1–900) rescued this growth (Fig. 3A), and as expected, all Cdc7 fragments lacking the kinase domain did not. The minimal rescuing fragment, GFP-Cdc7-(1–900), contains both the SPB localization and Spg1-association domains. These results indicate that C-terminal residues Cdc7-(900–1062) are dispensable for Cdc7 function. Cdc7 Self-associates in Vivo—It has been shown that Cdc15, the S. cerevisiae ortholog of Cdc7, interacts with itself. To determine whether Cdc7 associates with itself, co-immunoprecipitation analyses were performed on a diploid strain in which one allele of cdc7 was tagged with the Myc13 epitope and the other was tagged with the HA3 epitope. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates from the dually tagged diploid strain, but not the singly tagged strains, contained Cdc7-Myc13 and vice versa (Fig. 4A). These results established that Cdc7 is capable of associating with itself in vivo, suggesting that Cdc7 exists in cells as an oligomer. Because Spg1 associates with Cdc7, we asked whether it, also, was present in an oligomeric complex in vivo. We constructed a diploid strain containing both Spg1-Myc13 and Spg1-HA3 and performed immunoprecipitations using anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. In these experiments anti-HA immunoprecipitates from diploid strains did not contain Spg1-Myc13 and vice versa (Fig. 4B). Therefore Spg1, unlike Cdc7, does not appear to oligomerize in vivo. The results obtained above left open the possibility that monomeric Spg1 associates with oligomers of Cdc7. To test this likelihood, lysates prepared from the diploid S. pombe strain cdc7-HA3/cdc7-myc13 were incubated with recombinant GST-Spg1Q69L, a constitutively active mutant (5Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) of Spg1, or with GST alone bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Bacterially produced GST-Spg1Q69L, but not GST, bound to Cdc7 from lysates (Fig. 4C, top panel). Bound proteins were eluted off the beads, the eluate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were blotted for the presence of Cdc7-Myc13. As would be predicted if monomeric Spg1 bound to an oligomer of Cdc7, anti-HA immunoprecipitates contained Cdc7-Myc13 (Fig. 4C, bottom panel). To estimate the oligomeric state of endogenous Cdc7, lysates from asynchronously growing Cdc7-Myc13 and control untagged strains were prepared under native conditions and sedimented on sucrose gradients. The presence of Cdc7-Myc13 in each fraction was determined by immunoprecipitating and immunoblotting for the Myc epitope. Molecular size standards were run in parallel on an identical sucrose gradient. The majority of Cdc7-Myc13, co-sedimented in fractions 9 and 10 with the molecular mass marker phosphorylase B, which forms a trimer of 292.8 kDa. Because the predicted molecular mass of a Cdc7-Myc13 dimer is ∼285 kDa, this suggests that Cdc7 exists primarily as a dimer. Some Cdc7-Myc13 sediments lower in the gradient, and this could represent Cdc7 in complex with other proteins (such as Spg1) and/or in higher order complexes with itself (Fig. 4D). Importantly, Cdc7-Myc13 was not observed in any fraction that would be consistent with a monomeric form (140 kDa) of Cdc7-Myc13. To determine the domains required for Cdc7 self-interaction, we analyzed a series of cdc7 fragments in a two-hybrid assay. The best interaction was between the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the protein (Fig. 4E). Further truncations of either the N-terminal or C-terminal constructs abolished the interaction in the yeast-two hybrid system. This suggests that Cdc7 is capable of interacting with itself and that this interaction is between the N and C termini. In light of the sucrose gradient analysis, this interaction is most likely an intermolecular one. Cdc7 is a protein kinase essential for cytokinesis in fission yeast. It is an effector for the Ras superfamily GTPase Spg1, the activation of which is central to determining the timing of septation and cytokinesis in fission yeast. In the current model for SIN activation and signaling, Spg1 is converted to its GTP-bound state, which enables association of Cdc7 to the SPB. Hence it has been suggested that the regulation of Cdc7 kinase activity is mediated by its localization to a signaling competent SPB. In this study we demonstrate an association between Spg1 and a small fraction of Cdc7 during mitosis. Given that Spg1 associates with the SPB dynamically during both interphase and mitosis (16Morrell J.L. Tomlin G.C. Rajagopalan S. Venkatram S. Feoktistova A.S. Tasto J.J. Mehta S. Jennings J.L. Link A. Balasubramanian M.K. Gould K.L. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 579-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that we could detect only a small fraction of Cdc7 associating with Spg1. The mitosis-specific association of Cdc7 with Spg1 provides a means for Cdc7 to access its relevant targets at the SPB, and hence regulating that association would be a key step in regulating SIN signaling. To elucidate Cdc7 regulation, we have identified various functional domains within Cdc7. We have shown that a region adjacent to the kinase domain is responsible for association with Spg1 but insufficient for SPB localization. In addition we found that Cdc7 self-associates, adding another layer of complexity to SIN organization. A region just adjacent to the kinase domain of Cdc7, Cdc7-(250–535), acts as an effector domain and interacts with a G-protein, in this case Spg1, in a nucleotide-dependent manner. It has been shown previously that Cdc7 fails to localize to SPBs in germinating spg1 null spores or spg1–8 cells at restrictive temperature (33Cerutti L. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these data suggest that Spg1 is required for association of Cdc7 to the SPB, we found that amino acids Cdc7-(250–535) are capable of associating with Spg1 both in vitro and in vivo but fail to localize to the SPB. This suggests that additional residues and mechanisms exist that promote or maintain Cdc7 SPB localization. Indeed, the smallest region that could localize to the SPB, Cdc7-(360–870), is significantly larger than the Spg1-interacting region, although they overlap. Embedded within the Spg1 and SPB binding domain is a coiled-coil region; however, residues within this region are not sufficient to support binding to Spg1 or to localize to the SPB. 3S. Mehta and K. L. Gould, unpublished data. Cdc7 has been shown to associate with the SIN complex anchor Cdc11. However, we were unable to detect any direct interaction between Cdc11 and the SPB binding domain of Cdc7. 3S. Mehta and K. L. Gould, unpublished data. Interestingly, within Cdc15, the S. cerevisiae equivalent of Cdc7, the Tem1 binding domain, is also not sufficient for SPB localization. In fact, the relative organization of the Spg1 binding domain being adjacent to and including residues that are a part of a larger SPB binding domain is reminiscent of the domain structure found for Cdc15 (34Bardin A.J. Boselli M.G. Amon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5018-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In testing various fragments of Cdc7 for Spg1 and SPB interaction, we found that a GFP fusion of Cdc7-(1–900) localized efficiently to the SPB when produced at low level (Fig. 3A). This result is inconsistent with a previous report suggesting that the C-terminal 162 amino acids of Cdc7 are essential for SPB targeting (35Lu Y. Sugiura R. Yada T. Cheng H. Sio S.O. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is possible that by using the strong nmt1 promoter to drive expression at high levels, Lu et al. (35Lu Y. Sugiura R. Yada T. Cheng H. Sio S.O. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were unable to discriminate specific SPB staining from background. In the course of our studies, we found that Cdc7 self-associates. Through yeast two-hybrid analysis we find that this association is between the N and C termini with the most likely conformation involving an intermolecular interaction. A number of studies in the recent years have shown that homodimerization of kinases plays a critical role in regulating their functions (36Parrini M.C. Lei M. Harrison S.C. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 37Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar, 38Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). However, our evidence thus far suggests that Cdc7 dimerization is constitutive. First, a monomeric form of Cdc7 was not observed in sedimentation analyses. Second, Spg1 itself does not self-associate, and overproduction of Spg1 in a cdc7-HA3/ cdc7-myc13 diploid strain was not sufficient to disrupt Cdc7 self-association. 3S. Mehta and K. L. Gould, unpublished data. Finally, bacterially produced Spg1 associated with a oligomer, presumably a dimer, of Cdc7. These data taken together suggest that dimerization is obligate for Spg1 association. Although we did not observe any changes in Cdc7 dimerization at steady state levels, there may still be localized regulation of Cdc7 at the SPB. It is also likely that Spg1 association may still influence Cdc7 kinase activity at the pole. The latter possibility could be best tested in an in vitro system using purified components. Given that Cdc7 is a protein kinase with a variety of modular domains, understanding how Cdc7 is regulated through these domains to influence cytokinesis and septation in fission yeast is a critical next step. This will require in-depth structural analysis of Cdc7 in complex with Spg1. Such an analysis will help elucidate at the molecular level how Spg1 interacts with Cdc7 and whether changes in Spg1 nucleotide status influence Cdc7 conformation. Furthermore, identifying specific residues within Cdc7 that are responsible for contacting Spg1 and for Cdc7 self-association will enable the generation of specific point mutants of Cdc7 that are defective in Spg1 association, but not self-association, and vice versa and serve as useful tools to investigate Cdc7 regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2045107779,"Aldosterone acts to increase apical membrane permeability by activation of epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC). We have previously shown that aldosterone activates ENaC early in the course of its action by stimulating the methylation of the β subunit of this heteromeric channel in A6 cells. Aldosterone also stimulates the expression and methylation of k-ras in A6 cells. To determine whether aldosterone-stimulated methylations are seen in mammalian cells, we examined the effect of aldosterone on methylation and ras activation in a continuous line of cultured epithelial cells derived from mouse cortical collecting duct (CCD) and determined that β mENaC is a substrate for methylation by an enzyme contained in CCD cells. Aldosterone stimulated protein base labile methylation in CCD cells. Aldosterone stimulated Na+ transport in CCD cells within 1 h of addition and without an increase in cellular amount of any ENaC subunits over the first 4 h. Inhibition of methylation, using the inhibitor 3-deaza-adenosine, blocked the stimulation of Na+ transport induced by aldosterone at early time points (1–4 h) without affecting cellular amounts of any ENaC subunits. In contrast to 3-deaza-adenosine (3-DZA), which inhibits all methylation reactions, specific inhibitors of small G-protein methylation or prenylation had no effect on the early aldosterone-induced current. Overexpression of isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (PCMTase), the enzyme that methylates ras, had little effect on basal transport but enhanced aldosterone-stimulated transport in A6 cells. Overexpression of PCMTase in CCD cells had no effect on either basal or aldosterone-stimulated transport. Moreover PCMTase had no effect on ENaC activity when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Aldosterone had no effect on either message or protein levels of k-ras in CCD cells. Searching a mouse kidney library, we identified a methyltransferase that stimulates ENaC activity in Xenopus oocytes without affecting surface expression of ENaC. Our results demonstrate that aldosterone stimulates protein methylation in CCD cells, and this is required for expression of the early transport response. In CCD cells this effect is not mediated via methylation of ras, which is not induced by aldosterone in these cells, and the enzyme that methylates ras has no direct effect on ENaC activity. β ENaC is a substrate for methylation in CCD cells.

This is often viewed as occurring in several phases: an early phase in which existing channels are activated by alteration in either their trafficking and apical membrane expression (1Garty H.

Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). These actions occur through steroid receptor binding and activation of new protein synthesis. Rapid non-genomic activation of ENaC has also been described in some tissues (5Le M.C. Cluzeaud F. Fay M. Blot-Chabaud M. Cell. Mol. Biol.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the methylation reaction associated with stimulation of ENaC activity is likely to be at the channel: methyl donors stimulate Na+ uptake in apical membrane vesicles derived from A6 cells (10Sariban-Sohraby S. Burg M. Wiesmann W. Chiang P. Johnson J.P. Science. 1984; 225: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and directly stimulate ENaC activity in cell-excised patches (13Becchetti A.

Membranes derived from aldosterone-stimulated A6 cells contain enzymatic activity that methylates β ENaC in vitro and stimulates open probability of ENaC reconstituted in lipid bilayers (12Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M.

These observations suggest that methylation of β ENaC or a closely channel-associated protein mediates stimulation of the channel.On the other hand, k-ras is induced by aldosterone in A6 cells and appears to stimulate ENaC even in the absence of steroid, suggesting that levels of k-ras, at least in A6 cells, may be limiting for full channel activity. ras requires methylation for full activity and membrane localization (14Stockand J.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35449-35454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and this methylation is clearly stimulated by aldosterone in A6 cells (11Al Baldawi N.F. Stockand J.D. Al Khalili O.K. Yue G. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C429-C439Crossref Google Scholar). Overexpression of the enzyme that methylates ras, isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (PCMTase), although not stimulating basal current, does enhance the effect of aldosterone in A6 cells, and inhibitors of isoprenylcysteine methylation inhibit the response to aldosterone (15Stockand J.D. Edinger R.S. Al-Baldawni N. Sariban-Sohraby S. Al-Khalili O. Eaton D.C. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26912-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is not known whether this enzyme methylates β ENaC as well, but it seems unlikely as the consensus site for methylation by this enzyme, a -CAAX motif, is not present on the channel subunit. The lack of effect of overexpressing PCMTase on ENaC activity in the absence of aldosterone stimulation of k-ras is also consistent with the notion that this enzyme does not directly interact with the channel. This raises the possibility that there is a distinct methyltransferase that directly regulates ENaC in response to aldosterone stimulation. Finally transcriptosome data derived from a line of cortical collecting duct (CCD) derived from mouse kidney suggests that ras may not be an aldosterone-induced protein in mammalian kidney (16Robert-Nicoud M. Flahaut M. Elalouf J.M. Nicod M. Salinas M. Bens M. Doucet A. Wincker P. Artiguenave F. Horisberger J.D. Vandewalle A. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2712-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).These observations led us to reexamine the role of methylation reactions in the response to aldosterone in cultured mammalian CCD cells. If aldosterone-stimulated methylations are important to the early transport response, we sought to determine whether k-ras was induced in these cells and whether the response was related to ras processing. Finally we sought to determine whether β ENaC was a substrate for a membrane-bound methyltransferase in CCD cells and whether we could identify a methyltransferase that directly regulates ENaC in CCD cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Isc Measurements—mpkCCDc14 cells (CCD cells), a line derived from cortical collecting duct of SV40-transformed mice, were the generous gift of Alain Vandewalle (17Bens M.

Protein concentration was measured using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (40 μg/lane) were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blots were performed as described previously (18Lebowitz J. Edinger R.S. An B. Perry C.J. Onate S. Kleyman T.R. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41985-41990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Northern Blotting—For k-ras, cultured cells grown on Transwells were treated with 1 μm aldosterone for the time indicated. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62982) Google Scholar). Briefly three 60-mm plates for each condition were scraped in solution D (4 m guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% Sarkosyl, and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol) and transferred to a 15-ml conical tube. 1/10 volume of 2 m NaOAc was added and mixed followed by 1 volume of water-saturated phenol. ⅔ volume of chloroform was added and mixed thoroughly. The mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged to separate layers. The aqueous layer was removed, and the RNA was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. Total RNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water, and the concentration was determined by spectrometry. 10 μg of RNA was separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and cross-linked using Stratalinker (Stratagene). For tissue specification of methyltransferase 773 (MT773), FirstChoice Northern blot (Mouse Blot 1) was purchased from Ambion. The blots were subjected to gene-specific radiolabel probes specific for k-ras, β-actin, or MT773 in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml single-stranded DNA for 18 h at 55 °C. Following hybridization, the filter was washed twice at room temperature in 2× SSC and 1% SDS for 20 min followed by one wash at 68 °C in 0.1× SCC and 1% SDS for 20 min. The blot was subjected to imaging using the Personal FX molecular imager (Bio-Rad).Isolation of MT773—Complemetary primers (5′-CGCTGCTAAACTGCACCATG and 3′-GGGGTCTTAGGTTCTCACAC) were synthesized corresponding to the predicted sequence of MT773. These primers were used to amplify the product out of a mouse kidney cDNA library (Clontech, BD Biosciences) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. The product was cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm identity.In Vitro Expression of Full-length mENaC and MT773—Full-length β, γ mENaC and MT773 were subcloned behind the T7 promoter for use in in vitro translations. The β mENaC, γ mENaC, and MT773 proteins used in the methylation reactions were generated using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The ENaC subunits were labeled by the addition of [35S]methionine (MP Biomedicals, LLC) at a final concentration of 0.3 mCi/ml. Labeled proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE to ensure proper size. For the studies examining the methylation of in vitro translated mENaC, the β and γ subunits were incubated with [3H]AdoMet in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS and 25 μl of an in vitro translated MT773 enzyme preparation for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to imaging using the Personal FX molecular imager (Bio-Rad).Channel Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Xenopus oocytes (stage V-VI) were pretreated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (type IV) in calcium-free saline solution. Murine ENaC cRNAs (1–3 ng/subunit in 50 nl of H2O) were microinjected into all oocytes. Oocytes in the experimental group were additionally injected with 5 ng of cRNA of candidate methyltransferases. All oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (MBS) (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, and 15 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate). Whole cell currents were measured 24–46 h after cRNA injections.Whole Cell Current Measurements—A two-electrode voltage clamp technique was used as described previously (18Lebowitz J. Edinger R.S.

Whole cell inward amiloride-sensitive currents were measured in control oocytes expressing αβγ ENaC alone or experimental oocytes expressing αβγ ENaC + candidate methyltransferases using a DigiData 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and a TEV 200A voltage clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pClamp 7.0. Amiloride-sensitive currents were defined as the difference of the current in the absence and the presence of 0.1 mm amiloride. Oocytes were bathed in a solution containing 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm KCl, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.40. All measurements were made at room temperature (22–25 °C), and the bath solution was continuously perfused at 5 ml/min by gravity. Oocytes were typically incubated in the bath solution for at least 10 min before the current was recorded to allow currents to stabilize. Membrane potentials were clamped from –140 to +60 mV in 20-mV increments with duration of 900 ms. Currents were measured at a holding potential of –100 mV 600 ms after initiation of the clamp potential.Cell Surface ENaC Labeling—The general approach was based on the method of Zerangue et al. (22Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) as modified by Condliffe et al. (23Condliffe S.B.

Control oocytes expressing mouse α, β FLAG, and γ ENaC subunits and experimental oocytes co-injected with αβflagγ ENaC and MT773 were blocked with MBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin after 2 days of incubation. Oocytes were then exposed to MBS-bovine serum albumin with 1 mg/ml of mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. Of note, β ENaC containing the FLAG epitope (DYDKKKD) at the extracellular loop does not alter INa relative to wild type ENaC expression as first demonstrated by Firsov et al. (24Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.-M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). After the oocytes were labeled with primary antibody, they were washed six times in MBS-bovine serum albumin at 4 °C and incubated in MBS-bovine serum albumin supplemented with 1 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at 4 °C. After 12 additional washes, individual oocytes were placed in 100 μl of Super Signal ELISA Femto solution (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Chemiluminescence was quantified in arbitrary light units using a TD-20/20 luminometer.Adenoviral Infection of CCD Cells—Cultured cells grown on Transwell culture inserts were infected using a recombinant adenovirus encoding either MT773 or enhanced green fluorescent protein using varying m.o.i., and the current and expression of MT773 were examined 48 h postinfection.Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA from cultured cells grown on Transwell culture inserts infected with varying m.o.i. of MT773 or enhanced green fluorescent protein was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (above). cDNA was generated from equal amounts of total RNA using the Protoscript (New England Biolabs). The cDNA was amplified using primers specific for either MT773 or β-actin. Multiple numbers of cycles were performed to ensure that amplification was in the linear portion of the curves to allow quantification. Quantification was performed using Bio-Rad Quantity One software.Statistics—Median standard error is reported. t tests were performed using the Sigma Stat statistical program (Jandel Scientific). Results were considered significant if p < 0.05.RESULTSTo examine the role of methylation in response to aldosterone in the mammalian immortalized cortical collecting duct cells we first measured the effect of aldosterone on base-labile methylation in CCD cells. CCD cells were treated with either diluent or aldosterone, and membranes were isolated by homogenization and centrifugation as described previously (12Rokaw M.D. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A.

The compound AFC was used as a methyl acceptor for methylation activity and isolated by heptane extraction for vapor phase analysis of base-labile methylations as described previously (15Stockand J.D. Edinger R.S. Al-Baldawni N. Sariban-Sohraby S. Al-Khalili O. Eaton D.C. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26912-26916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, aldosterone increases AFC methylation in a GTP-dependent manner. These data indicate that CCD cells, like A6 cells and toad bladder cells in culture, respond to aldosterone by increasing protein methylation.To estimate whether methylation reactions were involved in the aldosterone stimulation of Na+ transport, we initially used inhibitors of methylation that have blocked aldosterone effects in toad bladder and A6 cells (9Wiesmann W.P.

The agent 3-deaza-adenosine (3-DZA) inhibits the enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and acts as a nonspecific inhibitor of methylation reactions (4Stockand J.D. Edinger R.S. Eaton D.C. Johnson J.P. News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 161-165PubMed Google Scholar). This agent has been shown to inhibit both protein and phospholipid methylations in toad bladder and A6 cells and totally inhibit the action of aldosterone in these cells. Fig. 2A shows that 3-DZA had the same inhibitory effect on aldosterone action in CCD cells. Because there was some inhibition of basal current, we examined whether 3-DZA affected the levels of ENaC subunits over the early time course of aldosterone action. Fig. 2B indicates that total CCD cell amounts of all three ENaC subunits were unaffected by either 3-DZA or aldosterone over the first 4 h of aldosterone stimulation of Na+ transport in these cells. These observations are consistent with results from mammalian kidney that show that total cellular amounts of ENaC subunits do not appear to increase over the early course of aldosterone action (25Sariban-Sohraby S. Fisher R.S. Abramow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26613-26617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 2The effect of methylation and prenylation inhibitors on the early aldosterone response in CCD cells. A, 3-DZA completely inhibits the aldosterone effect over the first 4 h (n = 6). B, the effects of aldosterone (Aldo) and 3-DZA on ENaC subunits in CCD cells following 4-h incubation. CCD cells were treated with either aldosterone (gray bars) or aldosterone and 3-DZA (open bars) for 4 h. Total cellular amounts of α, β, and γ ENaC were measured by semiquantification and compared with levels of ENaC in control cells (dark bars) as described under “Materials and Methods.” There was no significant difference in the cellular level of any subunit under these conditions (n = 4). C, cells were treated with aldosterone in the absence or presence of AFC or AGGC. Neither AFC nor AGGC significantly inhibited aldosterone response over the first 4 h; however, there was a tendency for the response to plateau after 3 h (n = 6). There was inhibition at 6 h by both agents (data not shown). D, inhibitors of isoprenylation of small G proteins did not affect the response to aldosterone over the first 4 h in CCD cells (n = 6).

Here, we verified that this 300-kDa molecule is chick SPACRCAN (sialoproteoglycan associated with cones and rods), another member of a novel interphotoreceptor matrix molecule family. Screening for chick SPACRCAN was carried out by plaque hybridization using a probe for chick SPACR. Specific polyclonal antibodies raised against chick SPACRCAN were used for the following experiments. To determine whether the 300-kDa molecule detected by MY-174 was identical to 300-kDa chick SPACRCAN, the migrations of these bands were examined after various glycosidase digestions. Furthermore, the expression levels were measured during retinal development and compared with those of chick SPACR. The results demonstrated that the 300-kDa molecule recognized by MY-174 was chick SPACRCAN, and we further identified it as a proteoglycan with chondroitin sulfate chains. SPACRCAN had heavily sialylated N- and O-linked glycoconjugates, and its MY-174 antigenicity was abolished by O-glycanase treatment after neuraminidase treatment, as observed for chick SPACR. During retinal development, the mRNA and core protein expression levels, MY-174 antigenicity, and hyaluronan binding ability of SPACRCAN peaked around embryonic day 17 and then gradually decreased, whereas the corresponding expression levels of SPACR simply increased, but not its hyaluronan binding ability. The MY-174 reactivity of SPACRCAN in the adult retina was decreased compared with that in the newborn retina, whereas that of SPACR was increased. The decreased hyaluronan binding of SPACR was induced by an inhibitory effect of the excess of sialic acids in the adult stage. Thus, with similar core protein structures and specific sialylated glycoconjugates but distinct chondroitin sulfate chains, SPACRCAN and SPACR may have separate roles in the retina due to their differing expression profiles during development.

The interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) 2The abbreviations used are: IPM, interphotoreceptor matrix; E, embryonic day; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; P, postnatal day. 2The abbreviations used are: IPM, interphotoreceptor matrix; E, embryonic day; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; P, postnatal day. resides in an extracellular compartment between the outer limiting membrane of the neural retina and the apical surface of the retinal pigment epithelium and is composed of proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans (1Adler A.J.

Projecting from the neural retina outer surface, elongated photoreceptor inner and outer segments penetrate and are surrounded by the IPM (3Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R. Moreira E.F. Midura R.J.

The IPM is thought to be involved in several important functions, including retinal adhesion, retinoid transport, intercellular communication, matrix turnover, regulation of neovascularization, cell survival, and photoreceptor differentiation and maintenance. However, specific roles for molecules found in the IPM have not been clearly defined, with the exception of a correlation between the expression level of SPACR (sialoprotein associated with cones and rods) and retinal adhesiveness (4Chen Q.

Chem. 2004; 279: 23142-23150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast to human SPACR, the SPACR orthologs in non-primate mammals, such as mice, rats, and bovines, are proteoglycans (9Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Nishiyama K. Shadrach K.G. Miyagi M. Crabb J.W. Rodriguez I.R. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 72: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), whereas the SPACRCAN orthologs are chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in both primate and non-primate mammals (10Hollyfield J.G.

II I Hollyfield J.G. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 435: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Previously, we revealed that chick SPACR is a glycoprotein that resides in the IPM, similar to the case for human SPACR, and that the coding regions of chick, mouse, and human SPACRs show a high degree of homology (5Zako M. Iwaki M. Yoneda M. Miyaishi O. Zhao J. Suzuki Y. Takeuchi M. Miyake G. Ikagawa H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25592-25600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Homologous regions are also detected between the deduced amino acid sequences of human SPACRCAN and SPACR, suggesting that they are members of a novel family of IPM-specific molecules (7Acharya S. Foletta V.C. Lee J.W. Rayborn M.E. Rodriguez I.R. Young W.S. II I Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6945-6955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether these molecules with similar core proteins also contain similar glycoconjugates and whether or not their expression profiles differ during development to accomplish their roles. In a recent study (5Zako M. Iwaki M. Yoneda M. Miyaishi O. Zhao J. Suzuki Y. Takeuchi M. Miyake G. Ikagawa H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25592-25600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we noted that MY-174, a monoclonal antibody raised against specific sialylated O-linked glycoconjugates of SPACR, also detected another molecule of 300 kDa in Western blot analyses. Furthermore, MY-174 specifically stained the matrix surrounding the photoreceptors, suggesting that the 300-kDa molecule resides in the same place as SPACR. SPACRCAN was previously shown to be expressed in this region in human, bovine, mouse, and rat retinas (10Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Midura R.J. Shadrach K.G. Acharya S. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). If the 300-kDa molecule is SPACRCAN, this implies that SPACRCAN has the same specific sialylated O-linked glycoconjugates as SPACR. Furthermore, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are generally expressed and play roles in the early stages of embryonic development (12Zako M. Shinomura T. Miyaishi O. Iwaki M. Kimata K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2155-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Brittis P.A. Canning D.R. Silver J. Science. 1992; 255: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 14Ring C.

Sci. 2000; 41: 4338-4346PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that SPACRCAN, previously reported to be a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, may be expressed and play specific roles in earlier embryonic stages compared with SPACR. However, the expression profiles of SPACRCAN and SPACR have not yet been compared within the same species during retinal development. In this study, we determined that the 300-kDa molecule recognized by MY-174 in the photoreceptor layer was chick SPACRCAN. The expression profile of SPACRCAN during development revealed that its major expression period is limited to the late embryonic stages. All of the characteristics of SPACRCAN were compared with those of SPACR, and the significance of the glycosylation chains on SPACR for hyaluronan binding was also examined. Materials—Fertilized eggs from White Leghorn chickens were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Embryos at different developmental stages were obtained according to the standard criteria of Hamburger and Hamilton (16Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9989) Google Scholar), and retinas after embryonic day (E) 12 were used for experiments. Retinas before E12 were not used because they were too difficult to isolate from the chick eye. Retinas from adult White Leghorn chickens were also used. Mouse monoclonal antibody MY-174 (17Yamagata M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was purified by E-Z-SEP (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG fractions to mouse immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) were obtained from Organon Teknika Corp. (Durham, NC). Affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from TAGO (Burlingame, CA). IgG fractions from non-immunized rabbit serum were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) and used as controls for immunohistochemical studies. Chondroitinase ABC (protease-free) and endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (O-glycanase) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan).

Cloning of Chick SPACRCAN—Based on the nucleotide sequence of chick SPACR (nucleotides 1992-2551; GenBank™ accession number AB070714), forward (5′-TGCCAGCGCTCTTCCTGACC-3′, nucleotides 1992-2011) and reverse (5′-GGTCTGCCTGATCAGCTGGC-3′, nucleotides 2551 to 2532) primers were designed to make a cDNA strand. PCR was performed on the newborn chick retinal cDNA library, and the cDNA obtained was inserted into the pUC118 DNA vector (Takara Biomedicals, Kyoto, Japan) for use as a probe. Next, we used a plaque hybridization technique and the chick SPACR probe to screen for molecules other than SPACR. The corresponding plasmid DNA was purified from the plaque, and both strands were sequenced using an ABI sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). Finally, we tried to obtain the full-length nucleotide sequence of a candidate for chick SPACRCAN using PCR 5′- and 3′-extension methods. Antibodies against Chick SPACRCAN—The DNA sequences obtained were analyzed using GENETYX-MAC computer programs (Software Development Co. Ltd., Tokyo). According to the predicted amino acid sequence, the polypeptide 817LTSTVAFSVE-TPVPSRALVV1087 was selected. The corresponding DNA amplified by PCR was ligated into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) containing glutathione S-transferase. This vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells, as recommended by the manufacturer for the expression of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Following lysis of the BL21 cells, the released glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified using a GSTrap™ FF column (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was separated from the glutathione S-transferase tag using PreScission™ protease (Amersham Biosciences), purified, and submitted to Qiagen, K. K. for use as an antigenic peptide to raise anti-chick SPACRCAN polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Biotinylation of Hyaluronan—Biotinylated hyaluronan was prepared by dissolving hyaluronan (0.7 mg/0.5 ml) in 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.8), incubating it with N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (50:1 hyaluronan/biotin) in Me2SO (7.5 mg/ml) at room temperature for 4 h, and reacting the resulting products with 25 μl of 1 m ammonium chloride (Pierce) for 10 min. The final solution was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2). Western Blotting—PBS-insoluble IPM samples were prepared from chick retinas according to previously reported procedures (3Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R. Moreira E.F. Midura R.J. Misono K. Todres E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31599-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The high molecular mass fractions separated on a Sephacryl S-300 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) were used for SPACRCAN analyses. A 30-μg aliquot of each retinal sample was digested with enzymes in the presence of protease inhibitors. Chondroitinase digestion was performed with chondroitinase ABC in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in the presence of protease inhibitors for 2 h at 37 °C. N-Glycosidase digestion was performed with N-glycanase in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Acylneuraminylhydrolase digestion was performed with neuraminidase (sialidase) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) for 1 h at 37 °C. O-Glycosidase digestion was performed with O-glycanase in 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 4.5) for 3 h at 37 °C. All samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 3-8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which allowed high molecular mass molecules to enter the gel. Separated proteins on the gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were incubated with MY-174, anti-SPACRCAN antibodies, polyclonal antibody O46-F for chick SPACR (5Zako M. Iwaki M. Yoneda M. Miyaishi O. Zhao J. Suzuki Y. Takeuchi M. Miyake G. Ikagawa H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25592-25600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), or biotinylated hyaluronan. The localization of MY-174, anti-SPACRCAN antibodies, O46-F, or biotinylated hyaluronan was detected using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences), as appropriate. The molecular masses of the protein bands on the SDS-polyacrylamide gels were estimated from the migration positions of protein standards (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). The NIH Image analysis program was used to measure the expression of SPACRCAN and SPACR in each sample. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Chick eyes were cut into two pieces and then fixed in 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde solution neutralized with calcium carbonate in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The fixed retinas were rinsed overnight in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) glycine at 4 °C, embedded in OCT compound (Miles Scientific, Naperville, IL) on petroleum ether/dry ice, and cut into sections (6-8 μm thick) using a cryostat. Next, the sections were incubated with the anti-SPACRCAN antibodies in 10% (w/v) normal swine serum for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS for 3 min each, the sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in PBS containing 10% (w/v) normal swine serum. Finally, the sections were rinsed in PBS, mounted in mounting medium (Shandon Lipshaw, Detroit, MI), observed under an Olympus fluorescence microscope, and photographed using Kodak Tri-X Pan film. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 20 different eyes, and reproducible results were obtained. As a control for nonspecific staining, the primary antibody was replaced with non-immune rabbit serum at the same protein concentration. No staining was observed in the control sections. Northern Blot Analysis—An aliquot (10 μg) of total RNA from each retinal sample was prepared and transferred to a nylon filter as described previously (19Zako M. Shinomura T. Ujita M. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3914-3918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) to obtain newborn retinal cDNA templates. A cDNA probe (0.6 kb, nucleotides 3517-4119; GenBank™ accession number AB204591) corresponding to the C terminus of chick SPACRCAN was amplified from the newborn retinal cDNA templates with forward (5′-TGCAACACTGCATATCACAC-3′, nucleotides 3517-3536) and reverse (5′-GGATGTCTCTGCACTGGTAG-3′, nucleotides 4119 to 4100) primers and used for hybridization. Similarly, a cDNA probe (0.4 kb) corresponding to the N terminus of chick SPACR was amplified from a newborn retinal cDNA template with forward (5′-ATGCATTTGAAAACTGGATT-3′) and reverse (5′-TTTCCCTCTGGCAGGCAGTA-3′) primers and used for hybridization as described previously (5Zako M. Iwaki M. Yoneda M. Miyaishi O. Zhao J. Suzuki Y. Takeuchi M. Miyake G. Ikagawa H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25592-25600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Quantitative Analysis—The NIH Image software program was used to analyze the expression level of each sample on the membranes. Statistical Analysis—All results were repeated three times and are presented as means ± S.E. Molecular Cloning of Chick SPACRCAN—Screening of a chick retinal cDNA library using a plaque hybridization technique identified a clone for a molecule that is similar to chick SPACR. We finally obtained a molecule with a 4888-bp open reading frame that encodes a 1423-amino acid protein (Fig. 1). A BLAST analysis of public data bases revealed that the molecule shows the highest homology to human SPACRCAN because it has 51.4 and 52.9% nucleotide sequence identities to mouse and human SPACRCANs, respectively. The amino acid sequence contains seven N-linked glycosylation sites, numerous potential O-linked glycosylation sites, and two epidermal growth factor-like domains near the C terminus, as observed in mouse and human SPACRCANs. Six RHAMM (receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility)-type hyaluronan-binding motifs (20Wang C. Entwistle J. Hou G. Li O. Turley E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) are present in the molecule. Two SEA (sea urchin sperm protein-enterokinase-agrin) modules (21Bork P. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), a structural domain often associated with O-glycosylation, are also present near the N and C termini, similar to the case for chick SPACR. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of the deduced primary amino acid sequence of chick SPACRCAN with those of mouse and human SPACRCANs. The deduced amino acid sequence shares 38.5 and 64.4% similarities with the mouse and human sequences, respectively, suggesting that they are indeed orthologs. Establishment of Anti-SPACRCAN Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against a synthesized peptide of chick SPACRCAN were newly established as described in “Experimental Procedures” and used for Western blot analyses of PBS-insoluble IPM samples after chondroitinase ABC treatment. A distinct band of 300 kDa was detected (Fig. 3A, arrow). After being stripped, the same membrane was reprobed with MY-174 or biotinylated hyaluronan. MY-174 and biotinylated hyaluronan each detected a 300-kDa band, similar to the anti-SPACRCAN antibodies (Fig. 3A, arrow). Next, we examined the localization of chick SPACRCAN in radial sections of newborn retina by immunohistochemical staining with the anti-SPACRCAN antibodies. Bright fluorescence was specifically detected in the photoreceptor layer (Fig. 3B, arrow), but not in other layers of the retina, as observed for human SPACRCAN. Glycosyl Modifications of the 300-kDa Bands Detected by MY-174 and Anti-SPACRCAN Antibodies—Next, the glycoconjugate modifications of the distinct 300-kDa bands detected by MY-174 and the anti-SPACRCAN antibodies were examined. Retinal samples were subjected to membrane blot analyses before and after digestion with chondroitinase ABC. After treatment with chondroitinase ABC, the intensity of the 300-kDa band detected by MY-174 increased, suggesting that it is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (Fig. 4A). Following the digestion with chondroitinase ABC, some samples were further digested with N- or O-glycanase or neuraminidase and then subjected to Western blot analyses with MY-174. After treatment with O-glycanase alone following chondroitinase ABC digestion, the size of the 300-kDa band did not change significantly. However, after treatment with N-glycanase or neuraminidase following chondroitinase ABC digestion, the size decreased by 20 or 50 kDa, respectively. Further treatment with O-glycanase after neuraminidase treatment abolished detection of the 300-kDa band altogether. This effect of O-glycanase treatment was not observed without neuraminidase predigestion, and this requirement has been well documented for other glycoproteins (22Glasgow L.R. Paulson J.C. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8615-8623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we stripped the above-mentioned membranes and reprobed them with the anti-SPACRCAN antibodies (Fig. 4B). After treatment with chondroitinase ABC, the intensity of the 300-kDa band detected by the anti-SPACRCAN antibodies increased, as shown in Fig. 4A. After treatment with O-glycanase alone following chondroitinase ABC digestion, the size of the 300-kDa band did not change significantly. However, after treatment with N-glycanase or neuraminidase following chondroitinase ABC digestion, the size decreased by 20 or 50 kDa, respectively, as observed for the staining with MY-174. Because MY-174 and anti-SPACRCAN antibodies recognized completely identical molecules in both immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses, we finally concluded that the 300-kDa molecule recognized by MY-174 corresponds to chick SPACRCAN. The band that became undetectable after treatment with O-glycanase following neuraminidase treatment in the staining with MY-174 was detected at 230 kDa by staining with the anti-SPACRCAN antibodies (Fig. 4), suggesting that the molecular mass of the O-linked glycoconjugates was 20 kDa. Thus, chick SPACRCAN and SPACR are modified by the same specific glycoconjugates, which are recognized by MY-174. SPACRCAN and SPACR Expression during Retinal Development— The SPACRCAN and SPACR mRNA expression levels during retinal development were quantified by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5A). Total RNAs isolated from chick retinas at various stages (from E12 to newborn) were electrophoresed, transferred to nylon filters, and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes for chick SPACRCAN and SPACR. The mRNA expression levels of SPACRCAN and SPACR in each sample were measured using the NIH Image program. A faint band for SPACRCAN mRNA was detected at E12, and its intensity increased with development up to a peak at E16 and then decreased. A band for chick SPACR mRNA was first detected at E15, and its intensity increased with development as shown previously (5Zako M. Iwaki M. Yoneda M. Miyaishi O. Zhao J. Suzuki Y. Takeuchi M. Miyake G. Ikagawa H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25592-25600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses using the anti-SPACRCAN antibodies, MY-174, and biotinylated hyaluronan were performed to assess the amounts of the chick SPACRCAN and SPACR core proteins, the specific glycoconjugates recognized by MY-174, and the hyaluronan binding property, respectively. Samples of PBS-insoluble IPM were obtained from chick retinas at various developmental stages (from E12 to newborn and postnatal day 2 (P2)) and from adult retinas. After digestion with chondroitinase ABC, the retinal samples were electrophoresed on 3-8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with the anti-SPACRCAN antibodies, MY-174, and biotinylated hyaluronan. A single band of 300 kDa was detected at E12 in all staining procedures, and its intensity increased with development to reach a peak at E17-E18 and then gradually decreased toward the adult stage (Fig. 5, B-D). To measure SPACR expression, the membrane was stained with O46-F and MY-174. Distinct 150-kDa bands corresponding to the chick SPACR core protein and the glycoconjugates recognized by MY-174 were detected. A single band of 150 kDa was first detected at E16, and its intensity subsequently increased with development (Fig. 5, B and C). The hyaluronan binding ability of chick SPACR was also measured and compared with the corresponding profile of chick SPACRCAN. The hyaluronan binding property of chick SPACR was first detected at E16, and it increased with development to reach a peak at P2 and then substantially decreased toward the adult stage (Fig. 5D). Involvement of SPACR Glycosylation in Hyaluronan Binding—The expression levels of SPACR, especially for the glycoconjugates recognized by MY-174, were higher in the adult than at P2, whereas the hyaluronan binding ability was significantly decreased in the adult. To assess this apparent inconsistency, the effects of the glycosylation modifications of SPACR on its binding to hyaluronan were examined by measuring the amounts of bound hyaluronan after digestions with glycosidase enzymes such as O-glycanase, N-glycanase, and neuraminidase. The hyaluronan binding ability of SPACR was much higher at P2 than in the adult without any enzymatic digestions (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2), and no change was detected after N-glycanase treatment (lane 4). However, the hyaluronan binding ability in the adult was significantly enhanced after neuraminidase treatment (Fig. 6, lane 3). Furthermore, treatment with O-glycanase following neuraminidase treatment produced a similar enhancement of neuraminidase treatment alone (Fig. 6, lane 5). As mentioned above, alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of human SPACRCAN and SPACR reveals several homologous regions (7Acharya S. Foletta V.C. Lee J.W. Rayborn M.E. Rodriguez I.R. Young W.S. II I Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6945-6955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Searches for homologous regions between the deduced amino acid sequences of chick SPACRCAN and SPACR show 39.7% homologous regions. This result clearly demonstrates the high degree of homology between these different molecules; and furthermore, both contain seven N-linked glycosylation sites, numerous potential O-linked glycosylation sites, an epidermal growth factor-like domain, and two SEA domains. A high degree of homology among the coding regions of chick, mouse, and human SPACRs has been reported previously (5Zako M. Iwaki M. Yoneda M. Miyaishi O. Zhao J. Suzuki Y. Takeuchi M. Miyake G. Ikagawa H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25592-25600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Lee J.W. Chen Q. Rayborn M.E. Shadrach K.G. Crabb J.W. Rodriguez I.R. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 71: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The homology among the coding regions of chick, mouse, and human SPACRCANs was also assessed. The nucleotide sequences shows a high degree of homology, with chick SPACRCAN showing 51.4 and 52.9% identities to mouse and human SPACRCANs, respectively. Furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence of chick SPACRCAN shares 38.5 and 64.4% similarities with the mouse and human sequences, respectively. More important, chick SPACRCAN contains important features that are also present in mouse and human SPACRCANs (4Chen Q. Lee J.W. Nishiyama K. Shadrach K.G. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Acharya S. Foletta V.C. Lee J.W. Rayborn M.E. Rodriguez I.R. Young W.S. II I Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6945-6955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), including several N-glycosylation sites, glycosaminoglycan attachment sites, two epidermal growth factor-like domains, and several hyaluronan-binding motifs. The high sequence homology to mouse and human SPACRCANs indicates that this chick gene is indeed the ortholog of mouse and human SPACRCANs. The presence of multiple functional domains in the protein suggests that SPACRCAN may play important and complex roles in retinal growth and development (4Chen Q. Lee J.W. Nishiyama K. Shadrach K.G. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The similarities among the chick, mouse, and human SPACRCANs suggest similar functional roles for this molecule in these species. It is interesting that SPACRCAN and SPACR were both modified by heavily sialylated O-linked glycoconjugates, including the specific glycoconjugates recognized by MY-174. Treatment with O-glycanase following neuraminidase digestion abolished the MY-174 antigenicity of both chick SPACR and SPACRCAN. Molecules with similar core protein structures are generally recognized to have similar functions, and our experiments produced the novel result that these two molecules with similar core proteins also have similar glycoconjugates. Although these molecules had similar core protein structures and specific sialylated glycoconjugates, they may play different roles due to distinct modifications of their chondroitin sulfate chains and their differing expression profiles during development. Both SPACR and SPACRCAN in the human and mouse IPM commonly have hyaluronan-binding domains containing RHAMM-type hyaluronan-binding motifs (3Acharya S. Rodriguez I.R. Moreira E.F. Midura R.J.

Here, we have revealed that chick SPACRCAN also has RHAMM-type hyaluronan-binding motifs, similar to chick SPACR. Hyaluronan is a prominent constituent of the IPM in all species studied to date, except for mice (24Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Tammi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 65: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Tammi M. Tammi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and has been detected in the chick IPM using a biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein (data not shown). Chen et al. (8Chen Q.

Chem. 2004; 279: 23142-23150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have shown that the RHAMM-type hyaluronan-binding motifs found in mouse SPACRCAN also bind to chondroitin sulfate. Thus, the functional complex of SPACRCAN and SPACR with hyaluronan and/or chondroitin sulfate in the matrix between the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium may have some important roles via protein-carbohydrate and/or carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions. Further investigations are necessary. During the development of the retina as well as the maintenance of its functions, the hyaluronan binding properties of SPACR and SPACRCAN may be necessary for cells to proliferate and migrate in the extensive matrix enriched with hyaluronan (3Acharya S.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfate molecules generally tend to have more numerous chondroitin sulfate chains during the embryonic period (14Ring C. Lemmon V. Halfter W. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 11-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Zako M. Shinomura T. Miyaishi O. Iwaki M. Kimata K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2155-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan on the cell surface may cooperate to ensure consistency as the extracellular matrix increases and then matrix stability, thereby promoting the formation of the extracellular matrix. Once retinal formation is completed, SPACRCAN may become redundant; consequently, the volume of the extracellular matrix decreases. SPACRCAN is potentially the embryonic equivalent of SPACR and may be involved in organogenesis, rather than homeostasis, of the retina. Finally, we have shown that SPACR expression, and its MY-174 antigenicity in particular, increased during retinal development, whereas the hyaluronan binding ability in the adult retina was significantly decreased. It is interesting that the hyaluronan binding ability of SPACR was significantly enhanced after neuraminidase treatment, regardless of O-glycanase treatment. It is possible that the number of sialic acids increases with age and that they sterically coat the hyaluronan-binding motif of SPACR, thereby inhibiting hyaluronan binding. Although the essence of this phenomenon remains unclear, it is possible that changes in the sialic acid residues on SPACR during aging may underlie some of the age-related diseases of the retina due to a decrease in its hyaluronan binding ability in the IPM."

Recently it has been shown that APN is capable of promoting phagocytosis by supporting Fc-γ receptors on peripheral blood monocytes (41Mina-Osorio P. Ortega E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 1008-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).APN has been implicated in the growth and function of immune cells, including T cells and T cell subsets (42Lendeckel U. Arndt M. Frank K. Wex T. Ansorge S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 17-27PubMed Google Scholar, 43Woodhead V.E. Stonehouse T.J. Binks M.H. Speidel K. Fox D.A. Gaya A. Hardie D. Henniker A.J. Horejsi V.

A significant fraction of malignant lymphocytes and corresponding cell lines appear CD13-positive in flow cytometry. In addition, CD13-negative T and B cell lines were shown to contain considerable amounts of APN mRNA (45Lendeckel U. Wex T. Reinhold D. Kahne T. Frank K. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that a dysregulation of APN expression may contribute to or result from malignant transformation of lymphocytes and/or enhanced cellular growth. A previous study reported mutations in the gene coding for APN in 18 and 6% of cases of leukemia and lymphoma, respectively. No such mutations were found among healthy controls (46Lendeckel U. Wex T. Arndt M. Frank K. Franke A. Ansorge S. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 1: S158-S160Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).We show here that cloning and sequencing of mutant APN-DNA fragments from a patient with lymphoma revealed the presence of a silent mutation not expected to affect protein structure and function and the substitution (Leu-243 → Pro) of a single amino acid residue. Further analysis of the latter mutation revealed significant effects on APN expression and enzymatic activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Reagents—Streptomycin, penicillin, glutamine, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and trypsin were purchased from BioWest, Essen, Germany. Pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, trypsin inhibitor, and molecular mass standards for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Sigma. Soybean trypsin inhibitor was obtained from Roche Diagnostics.l-[35S]Methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Acrylamide, N,N′-methylenebi-sacrylamide, and TEMED were purchased from Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany. SDS, ammonium persulfate, dithiothreitol, and Triton X-100 were obtained from Merck.pEGFP-N1 vector, pDsRed2-ER, and pECFP-Golgi were purchased from Clontech. pDsRed-Golgi vector was constructed by subcloning dsRed from pEDsRed1-N1 (Clontech) into pECFP-Golgi with BamHI and NotI.Restriction enzymes were obtained from MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany. Isis polymerase was obtained from Qbiogene, Heidelberg, Germany.Immunochemical Reagents—For immunoprecipitation of human APN, tagged with GFP, the GFP-antibody, purchased from Clontech was used.Construction of cDNA Clones—First, wild type human APN from U937 cells was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector, resulting in the expression vector pEGFP-wt-APN containing enhanced GFP fused inframe to the 3′ end of wild type APN. Second, the plasmid pEGFP-APNL243P was generated with the QuickChange™ in vitro mutagenesis system from Stratagene, according to the manufacturer's instructions, by using the pEGFP-APN (wild type) as the template.The following mutagenesis oligonucleotide (both sense and antisense) was used, 5′-CTTATCCACCCCAAGGACCCGACAGCCCTGTCCAACATG-3′. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing.Transient Transfection of COS-1 Cells, Biosynthetic Labeling, and Immunoprecipitation—COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with DNA by using DEAE-dextran essentially as described previously (47Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The plasmids pEGFP-APN and pEGFP-APNL234P were used throughout the studies. 48 h after transfection, the cells were biosynthetically labeled. The cells were incubated in methionine-free minimum Eagle's medium containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for the indicated time intervals and chased in pulse-chase experiments with nonlabeled methionine for different periods of time. Subsequently the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.5% Triton X-100, supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor for 30 min at 4 °C. After 1 h of preclearing with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose, the immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-GFP mAb and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose as described previously (47Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were further processed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed and analyzed by a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). In another set of experiments in which the turnover kinetics and degradation of the mutant were analyzed, the transfected cells were pulsed for 1 h with [35S]methionine and chased for long time intervals up to 36 h in the presence or absence of lactacystin (Sigma), an inhibitor of the proteasome function (48Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) used at a final concentration of 20 μm/ml medium. The cells were solubilized as described above, and the protein concentration in the lysates as well as the specifically bound radioactivity were estimated. Equal amounts of radioactivity were used in the immunoprecipitations. The labeling intensities of the mutant APNL243P were assessed relative to the first chase time point.Cell Surface Immunoprecipitation—Wild type and mutant APN antigens were isolated from the surface of COS-1 cells as described previously (49Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for 4 h at 37 °C, 12 h at 20 °C, or 8 h at 32 °C. Subsequently the cells were shifted to 4 °C, and wild type or mutant APN expressed at the cell surface was labeled by mAb anti-GFP added to the medium for 1 h. The cells were solubilized in lysis buffer, and APN-GFP was immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose prior to SDS-PAGE analysis.Trypsin Treatment of Cell Lysates—The immunoprecipitates from transiently transfected, [35S]methionine-labeled COS-1 cells were treated with 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 μg/μl trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by cooling on ice at 4 °C and addition of 200 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics).Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal images of living cells were acquired 2 days after transfection on a Leica TCS SP2 microscope with a ×63 water planapochromat lens (Leica Microsystems). Dual color GFP and dsRed images were obtained by sequential scans with the 468-nm excitation line of an argon laser or the 543-nm excitation line of a He/Ne laser, respectively, and the optimal emission wavelength for GFP or dsRed, as described previously.Measurement of APN Enzymatic Activity—Cells were resuspended in PBS and solubilized by sonication on ice for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min, and the particulate fraction was resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. GFP fluorescence was read at 488/507 nm using the luminescence spectrophotometer LS50 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and used to normalize for APN activity. The activity of APNL243P was determined by measuring the hydrolysis of Ala-p-nitroanilide (50Firla B. Arndt M. Frank K. Thiel U. Ansorge S. Täger M. Lendeckel U. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 584-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) ratio proportional to wt-APN.Transient Transfection of N109 Cells, Invasion, and Proliferation Assays—The renal carcinoma cell line N109 was recently established from a bone metastasis of a typical clear cell renal carcinoma at the Institute of Pathology, University of Magdeburg, Germany. It does not express any APN mRNA or protein. N109 cells were transiently transfected with wt-APN or APNL243P DNA by using Effectene (Qiagen) as described previously (49Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proliferation of N109 cells transfected with either wt-APN or APNL243P in comparison to sham-transfected cells was determined by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation as described (44Bank U. Tadje J.

Cellular invasion through a Matrigel-coated 24-well transwell chamber (Costar) was analyzed as described recently (51Krueger S. Hundertmark T. Kalinski T. Peitz U. Wex T. Naumann M. Roessner A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 2868-2875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection, N109 cells were incubated for another 24 h in the invasion chambers. Cells passing the membrane and attaching to the lower side of the Matrigel-coated membranes (invasive cells) were harvested using trypsin/EDTA, and the cell number was assessed using a Coulter Counter ZII.RESULTSThe mRNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a male 67-year-old patient suffering from non-Hodgkin lymphoma (centroblastic, IIIb) was isolated and transcribed into cDNA as described (52Lendeckel U. Wex T. Kahne T. Frank K. Reinhold D. Ansorge S. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 153: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Amplified DNA was sequenced by SSCP analysis, and two mutations were identified. Besides a silent mutation at position 115, an exchange from T to C at position 728 leads to replacement of leucine by proline at amino acid 243. The complete absence of T at position 728 in the sequences obtained indicate the homozygotic nature of this mutation (Fig. 1). This mutant was termed APNL243P and subsequently cloned into a pEGFP-N1 vector.Biochemical studies of APNL243P showed that it was predominantly expressed as an endo H-sensitive mannose-rich polypeptide (Fig. 2, APNh), whereas the wt-APN shows the typical pattern of a correctly processed glycoprotein, consisting of the mannose-rich precursor form (APNh, ∼170 kDa) and a complex glycosylated mature form (APNc, ∼190 kDa, consisting of the 166-kDa high monomeric form of mature APN enlarged by 27 kDa of monomeric GFP) (Fig. 2). Treatment with endo H led to a shift of the mannose-rich band down to ∼140 kDa in both cases, whereas the band representing the complex glycosylated wt-APN did not change (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 also shows that another mutant, APNΔ227P, which has been detected previously in a patient suffering from non-Hodgkin lymphoma (46Lendeckel U. Wex T. Arndt M. Frank K. Franke A. Ansorge S. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 1: S158-S160Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and is included for comparison, is expressed also as an endo H-sensitive mannose-rich polypeptide.FIGURE 2Expression and endo H sensitivity of APN variants. Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine for 6 h; homogenates of these specimens were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-GFP. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with or without endo H for 1 h at 37 °C prior to SDS-PAGE on 6% slab gels. Gels were analyzed by PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pulse-chase experiments of mutant and wild type APN showed that mutant APNL243P persisted as a mannose-rich species throughout the entire chase periods. By contrast, the wild type counterpart acquired complex glycosylation and endo H resistance already after 2 h of chase (Fig. 3). From these data we conclude that the mutant protein is not able to mature in the Golgi to a complex glycosylated protein because of impaired trafficking and intracellular accumulation in the ER.FIGURE 3Pulse-chase of APN at 37 °C. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNAs of wt-APN or APNL243P. After 48 h cells were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and then chased with nonlabeled methionine for the indicated times. Homogenates of these specimens were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-GFP and treated with endo H or not prior to SDS-PAGE on 6% slab gels. Gels were analyzed by fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To explore this further, confocal microscopy analysis was used to visualize the subcellular location of APNL243P. The mutant protein showed a distinct pattern of staining strongly associated with the ER (Fig. 4). In contrast, wt-APN was located in Golgi vesicles as well as on the cell-surface membrane, indicating that C-terminal attachment of GFP to APN does not change its normal subcellular localization (nor its function as shown by enzymatic analyses; data not shown).FIGURE 4Co-localization of the APN mutants with either an ER-specific marker, ER-dsRed, or a Golgi network marker, GT-dsRed. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with pEGFP-wt-APN and a Golgi-specific marker, GT-dsRed, containing the N-terminal 81 amino acids of human β1,4-galactosyltransferase (GT), tagged with dsRed. PEGFP-APNL243P and pEGFP-APNΔ227P were co-transfected with ER-dsRed, containing the signal sequence of calreticulin, a specific marker for the ER, and KDEL, an ER-retention sequence. Confocal analysis of the cells was performed 48 h after transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the intracellular localization, we co-transfected wt-APN and the L243P mutant with either pDsRed-ER, containing the signal sequence of calreticulin, a specific marker for the ER, and a C-terminal KDEL ER-retention sequence, or a Golgi-specific marker, the N-terminal 81 amino acids of human β1,4-galactosyltransferase (GT) tagged with dsRed. As shown in Fig. 4, wild type APN co-localized with both the ER and Golgi markers and furthermore was seen on the cell-surface membrane, whereas the mutated protein showed a distribution pattern identical to the ER marker only, with no structures beyond the ER being stained. By having assessed the intracellular localization of the APNL243P mutant in the ER as a mannose-rich polypeptide, we wanted next to determine the turnover rate and the fate of this mutant. For this, a pulse-chase experiment was performed employing prolonged chase time points. As shown in Fig. 5A, the mutant started to disappear steadily throughout the chase time points and was barely detectable after 36 h of chase. By contrast, wt-APN was still persistent, predominantly in its complex glycosylated form at the same time point (Fig. 5B). This finding indicates that the mutant is intracellularly degraded, and its turnover is substantially higher than that of the wild type protein. We therefore addressed the possible degradation of APNL243P by an ER-associated degradation mechanism, and we analyzed the mutant and its wild type counterpart in a pulse-chase experiment using lactacystin, an inhibitor of the proteasome function. The proportions of the mutant protein during the various chase time points were compared with that at the initial chase time point. As shown in Fig. 5A, a dramatic shift in the stability of the mutant is observed in the presence of the inhibitor. Almost 85% of the mutant persisted after degradation at 12 h of chase as compared with 40% without the inhibitor, and after 36 h of chase ∼65% was still present as compared with 25% without the inhibitor. This result is compatible with a proteasome-mediated degradation of the mutant.FIGURE 5Lactacystin treatment. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNAs of wt-APN (B) or APNL243P (A). After 48 h cells were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and then chased with nonlabeled methionine for the indicated times in the presence or absence of lactacystin. Homogenates of these specimens were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-GFP and treated with endo H or not prior to SDS-PAGE on 6% slab gels. Gels were analyzed by fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Many mutant phenotypes of membrane proteins in human diseases reveal the characteristics of temperature-sensitive mutants that acquire partial folding at the permissive temperature and subsequently are able to exit the ER to the Golgi and ultimately to the cell surface (52Lendeckel U. Wex T. Kahne T. Frank K. Reinhold D. Ansorge S. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 153: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At the nonpermissive temperature, these mutants undergo degradation in their initial mannose-rich polypeptides.To assess whether the APNL243P is temperature-sensitive, we analyzed its trafficking at various temperatures. Here, transiently transfected COS-1 cells were cultured at 22, 28, or 32 °C for 24 h prior to biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation. In the case of the 22 and 28 °C incubations, no change in the glycosylation pattern of the mutant protein was observed, whereas at 32 °C APNL243P showed a noticeable complex glycosylation pattern, suggesting that at this temperature the protein can acquire at least a partial transport competence. A pulse-chase experiment with a 30-min labeling period followed by a chase of up to 24 h showed that at 32 °C APNL243P gained complex glycosylation after 4 h, which is identical to the wt-APN (Fig. 6). But in contrast to wt-APN, the band representing the mannose-rich form of APNL243P did not disappear after 8 h but was only slightly faded after 16 h. In addition to conversion to the complex glycosylated form, this could be also due to general protein degradation.FIGURE 6Pulse-chase of wild type and mutant APN at 32 °C. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA of wt-APN or APNL243P. After 24 h cells were incubated at 32 °C for 12 h, biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min, and then chased with nonlabeled methionine for the indicated times. Homogenates of these specimens were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-GFP. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6% slab gels. Gels were analyzed by fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we investigated if APNL243P is able to reach the cell-surface membrane by performing a cell-surface immunoprecipitation at 32 °C (Fig. 7). A complex glycosylated form of wt-APN was clearly detectable on the cell surface at 32 °C, whereas in the case of APNL243P, no protein was found on the cell membrane either directly at 32 °C or after a chase of 1 h at 37 °C following the 32 °C incubation period. In the total lysate, the mannose-rich form as well as the complex glycosylated form was present, indicating that the mutant is able to reach the Golgi but not the cell surface. These biochemical fi"

Although postdoctoral associations have made tremendous progress toward improving the lives of postdoctoral fellows, their job is not finished yet. The first postdoctoral association was launched in the United States 13 years ago. Although postdoctoral associations have made tremendous progress toward improving the lives of postdoctoral fellows, their job is not finished yet. Ora Weisz's experience as a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, was first rate, so she had no reservations about staying at Hopkins in 1990 for a postdoctoral fellowship. But despite her general satisfaction with the postdoc, she quickly discovered a downside to her new position. As a graduate student, she had parking, health insurance, and a gym pass, but as a postdoc she was denied access to nearby parking and was forced to pay for benefits like insurance and gym privileges. Worse yet, Weisz's postdoctoral stipend amounted to less than she had received as a graduate student. Discussing these issues with other postdocs at Johns Hopkins, she discovered that she was not alone. “We really felt disenfranchised,” recalls Weisz, now an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh. In 1993, Weisz and a small group of postdocs banded together to form what would become the Johns Hopkins University Postdoctoral Association (JHPDA), the first organization of its kind in the United States. Benefits were just one of their concerns. “We were struck by the fact that there was really no guidance for postdocs,” says Atul Varadhachary, the association's founding president. “Nobody even knew how many research postdocs there were,” he says. So the first step the JHPDA took was to survey the university's postdocs to find out who they were and to tally their concerns. It turned out that they numbered more than 200 in the medical school alone, and the survey illuminated disturbing disparities in their stipends, including the fact that some were not getting paid at all. And stipends were only the beginning. Personal safety, health insurance, future job placement, and parking also ranked high among respondents' worries. After the survey, “We called an informal meeting to talk about the issues, and almost 100 people showed up. That's when it became clear that the problems were deeper than we realized,” says Varadhachary, who now serves as the president and chief operating officer of the biotechnology company Agennix in Houston, Texas. Initially, the association focused on building a community for postdocs, but they soon recognized that they needed institutional support as well. “We realized there was a limit to how much we could help ourselves. If someone is making $5,000 per year, no amount of networking will help,” says Varadhachary. The group turned to Levi Watkins, Jr., associate dean for postdoctoral programs at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School, for assistance. Watkins lent a sympathetic ear. “At that time, every other group at the university had an organization. Postdocs were the only ones not represented,” he says. “I told them, hey—you guys are at the back of the bus, and I mean the educational bus, not just at Hopkins, but in America,” says Watkins, an African-American who participated in the Montgomery bus boycotts of the 1950s. Much has changed since the launch of the JHPDA 13 years ago. Thanks to the group's work, postdoctoral fellows at Hopkins now receive health insurance, dental benefits, and uniform stipends based on salary scales set by the National Institutes of Health. Satellite parking allows fellows to avoid dangerous neighborhoods near the medical school, the JHPDA maintains a handbook to guide postdocs through their fellowships, and a professional development office offers training in skills such as grant writing. But creating a voice for postdocs may be the JHPDA's biggest accomplishment of all, says Watkins. “That voice didn't exist anywhere in America before then,” he says. Postdoctoral associations have blossomed at about 120 institutions across the United States. In 2003, a small group of association leaders formed the National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) to act as an advocate at the national level and to facilitate networking and information sharing across institutions. Seed money for the NPA came from a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The NPA developed a list of recommended practices for postdoctoral fellows, says Alyson Reed, the group's Washington DC-based executive director. These practices include minimum stipends, structured mentoring, and a standardized orientation process. Currently, about 50 institutions have adopted at least a portion of these practices, she says. “In the last five years, there has been an incredible amount of growth in the number of postdoctoral associations and offices,” says Reed. “This is a zeitgeist,” says Crispin Taylor, executive director of the American Society of Plant Biologists and a member of the NPA advisory board. “There is increasing recognition among universities that there are benefits to professionalizing the postdoc, whether for competitive reasons or to increase the university's output,” he says. A recent survey of postdoctoral fellows conducted by the Sigma Xi Scientific Research Society in Research Triangle Park, NC, found that postdoctoral productivity is markedly higher at universities that have postdoctoral associations than at those without such groups. The survey also turned up two strong predictors of a positive postdoc experience: a measure of structured oversight and access to professional development opportunities, both of which are included in the NPA's list of recommended practices. Exactly which functions an association provides varies from institution to institution. But the current glut of PhDs relative to jobs has placed career counseling in high demand. “Postdocs are often looking at careers in worlds that their PI can't mentor them in. A postdoctoral association can provide resources for looking into careers in nontraditional areas,” says Weisz. At New York University (NYU), for example, the postdoctoral association holds a biannual career symposium to expose postdoctoral fellows to careers outside of academia. “We've made postdocs more aware of the options that are open to them,” says Chris Blagden, founding member of the NYU postdoctoral association. “Some people are interested in industry, but they don't have much in the way of contacts. We bring people in from industry to tell us what kind of skills and experience they're looking for,” he says. These symposia have included seminars on technology transfer, patent law, and science writing. The JHPDA, meanwhile, is working to develop a career training course that is specifically for postdoctoral fellows. “The kind of training we get in the lab is how to do good science, but that doesn't mean that you can manage a lab,” says Simon Williams, the JHPDA's current president. “We're looking to put together courses for postdocs who are ready to make the next step,” he says. Such programs will include leadership and management courses to teach skills that could be applied to academic careers as well as those outside of academia. But postdoctoral associations cannot do it all. “Our organization is run by postdocs who volunteer our time while trying to advance our professional situations,” says Williams. “It would be nice to have a dedicated staff that would cater specifically to the postdoc needs,” he says. Dedicated postdoctoral offices do exist at other universities, and they can provide continuity and support that an association, with its volunteer members who typically move on after a few years, cannot, says Reed. Unlike postdoctoral associations, which are generally self-organized groups that come together on their own, postdoctoral offices are typically organized by the institution itself and supported with a staff and budget. Says Trevor Penning, founder of the Biomedical Postdoc Program at the University of Pennsylvania, “Our postdoctoral office was generated in 1996 because concerned faculty thought the postdocs deserved something better.” The program's first mission was to catalog their existing postdocs. “We trimmed the number of appointment categories from 17 to 3 and moved to an annual renewal option based on funding and satisfactory performance,” says Penning. The office also put into place a five-year limit on postdoctoral appointments. “We want our postdocs to come and leave,” says Penning. “We don't want them to be looking at this position as a permanent job; it's a stepping stone.” In Europe, the situation for postdocs appears slightly rosier, at least for some issues. “Labor law in most EU states provides more protection for postdocs, more holidays and more secondary benefits [than postdocs receive in the US],” says Peter J. Peters, dean of postdoctoral affairs at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam. He says that although salaries for postdoctoral fellows in the US often appear higher at first glance, these are quickly canceled out by the more generous health care and social services that postdocs in European countries receive. “The conditions of the postdoc here are pretty good,” says Katherine Brown, a member of the newly minted postdoctoral association at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany. EMBL's association arose from a desire to create a community for postdocs, and the group is focusing its initial efforts on creating a social network and providing postdocs with career development and exposure to career opportunities outside of academia. The group is also working to get a pension program established. Postdoctoral associations are a relatively new phenomena in Europe, where very few exist at the moment, says Nigel Thrift, Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Research at Oxford University in the UK. Thrift recently surveyed the League of European Research Universities (an association of 18 research-intensive universities) about the services they provided to postdoctoral fellows. “Nearly every university has identified the problems [facing postdocs], but they're in different stages of finding the solutions,” he says. The Netherlands Cancer Institute is among the leaders. The Institute organized their first postdoctoral retreat in 1999, and the annual retreat is thriving. The most recent retreat, in October of 2005, offered workshops in topics including “getting funded,” “setting up your laboratory,” “setting up collaborations,” “increasing your visibility,” and “mentoring and being mentored.” The Karolinska Institute in Stockholm is not far behind the Netherlands Cancer Institute. Though they don't have an association specifically for postdoctoral fellows, the Karolinska Institute has developed a junior faculty program that includes postdocs and is modeled on American postdoctoral associations, such as that at the University of Pennsylvania. “We modified it to Swedish conditions,” says coordinator Johanna Bäckström. It's only been around a couple of years, but so far the program has established mentoring programs, grant writing courses, travel grants, and social activities for its 650 members. They are also working with government officials to resolve pay and benefits issues. Despite their successes, postdoctoral associations still have plenty of work to do. “One of the biggest areas where we really need to make progress is the mismatch between career expectations and outcomes. Very few people actually get the academic jobs they wanted when they finished their postdocs,” says Reed. “The PI and institution need to be thinking about this so we don't have all these people who are using a postdoc as a holding position because they can't find another job,” she says. “In some ways, we're trying to return the postdoc to its roots. It is supposed to be a training period and a time of mentorship, not just a job whose purpose is to crank out research results for someone else,” says Reed. Watkins points to communication as another area that needs work. “It's been very hard to get PIs to do substantive evaluations of their postdocs so that the postdocs understand where they stand, how long their training will be, and what the expectations are,” he says. The Sigma Xi postdoc survey suggested that, in the end, communication can make or break a postdoctoral fellow's experience. The people who reported the highest satisfaction with their postdocs were those who had clear expectations that had been agreed upon in advance with their mentors, says Geoff Davis, a mathematician at Sigma Xi who oversaw the survey. “We've come a long way, but like the civil rights movement, we still have a way to go,” says Watkins."

Dover court case that intelligent design is a form of religion and cannot be taught alongside evolution in science classes in US public schools garnered worldwide attention. But why is the antievolution movement so powerful in the United States? The recent ruling in the Kitzmiller v. Dover court case that intelligent design is a form of religion and cannot be taught alongside evolution in science classes in US public schools garnered worldwide attention. But why is the antievolution movement so powerful in the United States? In late December 2005 in the United States, newspapers, weekly news magazines, television, and radio extensively covered the long-awaited decision in a remarkable Federal district court trial, Kitzmiller v. Dover. The court case was brought by Tammy Kitzmiller and ten other concerned parents in the town of Dover, Pennsylvania, against the Dover Area School Board. Their concern was the board's requirement that “intelligent design” (ID), a form of creationism, be taught as an alternative to evolution in ninth-grade science classes in Dover area high schools. The teaching of evolution has been a contentious topic in Dover for several years. A skirmish took place a couple of years ago over a student-painted mural of human evolution, which was torn down and burned by a school district employee. In the fall of 2004, conservative school board members—concerned about the new Pennsylvania state science education standards requiring that evolution be taught in schools—set about finding ways to “balance” the presentation of evolution with something that would reflect the generally conservative religious views of the community. In US public schools, students cannot receive religious instruction, although comparative religious views can be described. Unlike Canada and some other nations, the US does not have a publicly supported system of religiously affiliated schools; our constitution requires public agencies like schools to be religiously neutral. There are privately funded networks of Catholic and Protestant parochial schools for those who wish their children to receive religious instruction in school. Thus, in US public schools, it is not legal to advocate the six-day biblical view of creation as expressed in a literal reading of Genesis in any classroom, nor, since a 1987 Supreme Court decision, is it legal to teach a form of biblical creationism called “creation science,” invented in the 1960s. Creationists have sought to avoid the legal problems of teaching creation science by inventing ID (in content a minimalist subset of creation science). They have been lobbying for the teaching of ID as an alternative to evolution in science class not only in Dover but also in Kansas and elsewhere. Policies requiring the teaching of ID are extant in Bluffton, Indiana, and in Blount County, Tennessee, and efforts have been made to incorporate ID into the science standards of several states. Judge John Jones III, the judge in the Kitzmiller case, was not persuaded that ID is a legitimate scientific alternative to evolution. “Judge Rules Intelligent Design Is Not Science!” was a typical headline, reflecting the judge's decision—laid out in a 139-page ruling—that ID was merely a form of creationism. His ruling that the new ID form of creationism is a form of religion and thus its teaching in science classes is unconstitutional is of course a great victory for science and science education. However, many newspapers commented that other communities around the country are still wrestling with creationism and that, even with the solid anti-ID decision in Kitzmiller, there may well be other Dovers and possibly other trials in the future. And, proving them correct, within a month, a small school district in southern California was embroiled in a lawsuit brought by parents against an intersession course on ID. Outside of the United States, people are dumbfounded by events like these. They find it inexplicable that a powerful, modern industrial nation that routinely sweeps the Nobel prizes in science nonetheless is home to a population almost half of whom rejects one of the foundational ideas of modern science. Why do Americans have such a problem with evolution? There are a number of reasons for American antievolutionism, many of which lie in the social, political, and, especially, religious history of the United States. The US constitution codifies the separation of church and state partly because the founding fathers knew the bloody history of religious warfare that had scarred so much of Europe. Religious history in the US is marked by a strong current of religious dissidence, having been colonized originally by members of sects with quite specific—and different—ideas about salvation. The US has also fostered a tradition of decentralized, do-it-yourself theology that produced many extant and extinct sects, including the Latter-Day Saints, Christian Science, Seventh-Day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Shakers, and others (Scott, 2005Scott E.C. Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction. University of California Press, Berkeley, CA2005Google Scholar). The tendency not to follow ecclesiastical authority has a long history on our side of the Atlantic. The decentralization of religion arises partly from the dissident tradition and partly from our frontier tradition. For much of early American history, there were no central governing bodies, and, if a frontier settlement desired police stations, fire houses, schools, or other community services, they had to devise ways of providing them; outside help from territorial or state governments was generally unavailable or ineffective, and the federal government was too weak to extend services to frontier communities. If a community wanted churches, it often was on its own: it had to hire a minister (or someone in the community was “called” to serve) and raise funds to build and support a church. Local control and local orientation grows naturally out of a dissident, frontier history where hierarchy is neither possible nor desired. In the United States, education is decentralized to a degree not seen in any other developed nation. This may reflect America's frontier history, in which local control of education was a necessity that became enshrined as an ideal. Americans are fiercely protective and defensive of local control of education, even when it results in great inequities of educational opportunity. But whatever the relative merits of local control of education—and there are of course advantages—control of curriculum is not one of them. When I talk to the foreign press, I usually have to preface discussion of the creationism/evolution controversy by explaining that, no, the US does not have a national curriculum in science and that, in fact, local school boards composed of well-meaning if largely scientifically uninformed individuals are ultimately responsible for deciding what gets taught and when. I explain that the US has approximately 17,000 independent school districts and that this administrative patchwork results in a highly irregular distribution of curricula. Some students learn the planets of the solar system in grade 2, some in grade 3, and some never get around to it at all. Some districts require teachers to teach evolution, and some ignore it completely. Understandably, this elicits surprise from those who live in countries where national curricula are viewed as the source of stability in instruction. Standardization of curricula is beginning to take place, however. The Reagan administration's A Nation at Risk called for the establishment of subject matter curriculum standards, and the process was begun during the administration of the first President Bush. Because of the decentralization of American education, the national standards in math, history, and science would only be advisory guides for states as they developed their own standards and subject matter curricula. The National Science Education Standards (NSES) were published in 1996 (National Research Council, 1996National Research Council National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. National Science Education Standards. National Academy Press, Washington, DC1996Google Scholar ), and were highly influential as states devised their standards. Because professional scientists had written the NSES content sections, evolution was well represented; evolution thus entered the curriculum of many states for the first time. Through a variety of carrot-and-stick provisions, states would coax or coerce local school districts into adopting the state standards—for example, by withholding state money from districts that did not adopt the state standards. Ironically, what began as an effort to improve the quality and quantity of science education—the standards movement—triggered the current increase in antievolutionism. The federal 2002 No Child Left Behind (NCLB) education law requires states to administer periodic examinations to students; test content is based upon state standards. School districts will be rewarded or punished depending upon student performance; these are high-stakes tests indeed. Such high-stakes tests will determine the curriculum: what will be tested determines what will be taught. Because most state standards include evolution (Gross, 2005Gross P. The State of State Science Standards, 2005. Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, Washington, DC2005http://www.edexcellence.net/doc/Science%20Standards.FinalFinal.pdfGoogle Scholar), evolution will be on the tests and will therefore be taught. When evolution is taught, antievolutionism increases. NCLB requires states to begin testing in science by 2007; this looming date helps to explain current squabbles over state science standards and other creationist activity. Another important reason that has enabled antievolutionism to take root is that America has a tradition of free speech, fairness, and letting everyone have their say. This admirable cultural quality is a great advantage when making political and social decisions about which opinion should be considered. It is, however, irrelevant in science. Whether the earth goes around the sun or the sun goes around the earth is not a matter of opinion. Whether living things descended with modification from common ancestors or were specially created at one time is not a matter of opinion, though some Americans would like to think so. Scientific knowledge grows as we make inferences from empirical evidence and test explanations: the scientific community has inferred from an overwhelming amount of evidence that, indeed, living things have descended with modification from common ancestors. Like all scientific explanations, evolutionary theory changes with new information and new ways of looking at data, but the big idea of evolution—common ancestry—remains solid. Still, the idea of “fairness,” of “balancing” evolution with a religious idea, has enormous traction for the American public. Another explanation for antievolutionism in the US is the popularity of biblical literalism in American Christianity, a religious tradition that is relatively rare in European Christianity. Between 1910 and 1915 a series of booklets were published called “The Twelve Fundamentals.” They outlined a back-to-basics type of American Christianity stressing the inerrancy of the Bible, which began a religious tradition known as Fundamentalism. It has been far more popular in North America than in any other part of the world, and it is within the biblical literalist tradition of Fundamentalism that antievolutionism finds its roots. The best kept secret in this controversy is that Catholics and mainstream Protestants routinely teach evolution in their parochial schools. Their formal theological positions on evolution are typically a form of theistic evolution—the view that evolution occurred, but it is part of God's plan and God works through evolution. Because of some confusion around this issue, the official Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, recently published an article by a scientist reiterating doctrinal acceptance of evolution. Historically, some of the most vigorous and effective opponents of creationism in the schools have been religious leaders. It is safe to say that antievolutionism is largely an American problem. But it is being exported to foreign countries, and in the last couple of years, NCSE has received reports of creationist activity outside of the US. The pattern has been very different from American creationism. Creationist “flare ups” recently have occurred in Brazil, Serbia, and Italy, all of which have top-down education systems in which a central administrator has considerable authority to make decisions about education policy. In all three of these countries, antievolution policies were imposed from on high: the top education official made the decision. In Serbia, for example, Ljiljana Colic, minister of education, decided (apparently with no consultation with other administrators) to remove evolution from the curriculum. After an outcry from scientists, teachers, the clergy, politicians, and others, the decision was reversed and Colic resigned (Hamilton, 2004Hamilton, D. (2004). Darwin goes back to school in Serbian U-turn. Yahoo! India News (Reuters), September 10, 2004. http://in.news.yahoo.com/040910/137/2fzoj.html.Google Scholar). This top-down education system is quite different from the decentralized American pattern, where antievolutionist pressure typically arises from grass-roots activity. In the United Kingdom, a slightly different pattern has occurred with the establishment of “academies,” a charter-school-type system established by the British government to improve student performance in low-performing areas. Citizens can operate independent schools that nonetheless receive a large amount of public money. The academies are free to experiment with curricula, labor policies, and organization in a “let a thousand flowers bloom” approach to improving public education. A wealthy businessman, Sir Peter Vardy, has founded a series of academies where creationism is routinely taught alongside evolution. British scientists seem to be stunned by this occurrence but, unlike American academics, do not appear to be taking any action beyond the occasional outraged letter. The decision in the Kitzmiller v. Dover court case that the new intelligent design form of creationism is a form of religion and thus its teaching in science classes is unconstitutional is of course a great victory for science education. The judge's decision was based upon 6 weeks of testimony, a great deal of which focused upon the nature of science, the science of evolution, and whether there was a scientific warrant for ID. Parts of the decision read like a good graduate student paper: When was the last time you read a legal decision that casually referred to exaptation? The “theory” of ID is pretty thin stuff. The main claim is that evolution is an inadequate scientific theory; therefore, it is necessary to explain certain biological phenomena by resorting to the direct actions of an “intelligent agent,” whom no one doubts is God. Accordingly, ID's proponents offer a list of long-refuted creationist arguments about the supposed inadequacy of evolution: gaps in the fossil record, the impossibility of building complex organisms through natural selection, and so on. Because the religious underpinnings of ID were so clearly exposed in the Dover trial, ID is no longer a viable creationist strategy. The fallback creationist position will be to argue for “balancing” the teaching of evolution with alleged “evidence against evolution,” keeping the content of ID but avoiding the legally problematic intelligent agent. The leading ID think-tank, the Discovery Institute, is already promoting this view, which they call “teach the controversy.” Relying on the public's attraction to the fairness argument, they propose that students should be given “all the evidence” and be able to “decide for themselves.” Of course, the “evidence” is erroneous science, and few would argue that students' critical thinking skills are improved by teaching them incorrect information. So antievolutionism will continue to be promoted by a well-organized and passionate minority of Americans, to the detriment of science education and science literacy. This is a matter of concern: We seem not to be producing well-educated high school and college graduates, and our graduate programs in the biological sciences already have a disproportionate percentage of foreign-born students. The lack of teaching of evolution in high school is probably symptomatic of a larger problem of the politicization of American education, which is resulting in a dumbing down of the curriculum. Foreigners are perplexed: While students in the scientific powerhouse that is the US are being taught creationism, learning misinformation about evolution, or not being taught evolution at all, students in foreign countries are learning evolution—and then are coming to the US for graduate training. The ruling by Judge Jones in favor of Kitzmiller may have been a victory for science, but the broader issue of antievolutionism in America remains."
