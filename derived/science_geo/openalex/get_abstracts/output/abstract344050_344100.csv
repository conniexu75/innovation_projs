https://openalex.org/W2057296759,"Measurements of chlorophyll, particulate carbon, and biogenic silica concentrations near a receding ice edge off the coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica, indicated the presence of a dense phytoplankton bloom. The bloom extended 250 kilometers from the ice edge and was restricted to waters where the melting of ice had resulted in reduced salinity. The region involved was one of enhanced vertical stability, which may have favored phytoplankton growth, accumulation, or both. Epontic algae released from melting ice may have served as an inoculum for the bloom. Ratios of organic carbon to chlorophyll and biogenic silica to carbon were unusually high, resulting in high biogenic silica concentrations despite only moderately high chlorophyll levels."

Since the calls often are accompanied by strong seismic signals (thumps), and since the male white-lipped frog exhibits the most acute sensitivity to seismic stimuli yet observed in any animal, these animals may use seismic signals as well as auditory signals for intraspecific communication."

https://openalex.org/W2161012157,"This article describes a technique for the spectroscopic of metal clusters and intermetallic compounds. First, metallic samples are vaporized by a pulsed YAG (yttrium-aluminum garnet) laser, and then the gaseous products are excited with a pulsed-dye laser until they fluoresce. A time-resolved, fluorescence spectrum is then measured by the product. The application of this technique to the study of metal dimers is reviewed, with emphasis on recent results from Be(2) and Cr(2). Studies of such species often yield insights into the chemistry of metals and metal-metal bonding."
https://openalex.org/W2050819294,"The dinoflagellate, Amphidinium wigrense, contains triple membrane-bound bodies we have termed ""blue-green chloroplasts."" We believe these chloroplasts were derived from a cryptomonad endosymbiont similar to that present in another blue-green dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium acidotum. These dinoflagellates provide evidence that a chloroplast has evolved from an endosymbiotic eukaryote."
