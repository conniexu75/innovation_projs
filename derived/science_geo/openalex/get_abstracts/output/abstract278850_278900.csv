https://openalex.org/W2003367399,"Different species of benthic Foraminifera taken at the same level in an Atlantic core yielded different oxygen isotopic values. It was therefore impossible to deduce paleotemperature values. In addition, pelagic and benthic species showed the same isotopic variations, an indication that pelagic and benthic species reflect only the variation of oxygen-18 composition of the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2002447245,"Diadema antillarum possesses a sensitive escape response to juices of crushed conspecific sea urchins. Stimulation usually results in urchins moving rapidly downcurrent. Strong species specificity of the response suggests that it is an adaptation to reduce predation. Diadema antillarum also responds with a running response to contact with Cassis tuberosa, a known predator."
https://openalex.org/W2089927992,"Lumps of crude oil residue floating the sea surface have been observed widely. Samples were taken with surface-skimming nets in the Mediter-ranean Sea and eastern North Atlantic Ocean; their displacement volumes were as large as 0.5 milliliter per square meter. An isopod, Idotea metallica, appears to be associated with the lumps, and a barnacle, Lepas pectinata, grows upon them. Lumps were found in stomachs of Scomberesox saurus, a surface-feeding fish importanit in ocean food webs. Films on the lumps, presumably consisting mostly of bacteria, consumed oxygen at the rate of 4 cubic millimeters per hour per square centimeter of lump surface. Chemical analysis suggested that certain lumps had been at large for only a few weeks; data from barnacle size and growth rate suggested that other lumps were at least 2 months old."
https://openalex.org/W1991721197,"The isotope effect in the solution of helium in water from 0 degrees to 40 degrees C has been determined by microgasometric measurements of the solubilities of pure helium-3 and helium4. At 0 degrees C helium-3 is less soluble than helium-4 in both distilled water and sea-water by 1.2 percent. The observed fractionation factor is 0.988+/-0.002 at 0 degrees C and appears to decrease with increasing temperature at the rate of 0.0001 per degree Centigrade, although the existence of this trend is of limited statistical certainty. The measured isotope effect is in agreement with the ratio of helium-3 to helium-4 in surface ocean water reported by Clarke, Beg, and Craig."
https://openalex.org/W1996560516,Seismic signals recorded from impacts of missiles at the White Sands Missile Range are radically different from the signal recorded from the Apollo 12 lunar module impact. This implies that lunar structure to depths of at least 10 to 20 kilometers is quite different from the typical structure of the earth's crust. Results obtained from this study can be used to predict seismic wave amplitudes from future man-made lunar impacts. Seismic energy and crater dimensions from impacts are compared with measurements from chemical explosions.

https://openalex.org/W2049711486,"The crystal structure of a cubic phase of composition XeF(6) has been determined at -80 degrees C. There are no simple molecules in the complex structure which involves 1008 atoms distributed over 1600 positions per unit cell. Ions of XeF(5)+ and F- are associated in tetrameric and hexameric rings of point group symmetries 4 and 32, respectively. The structure contains right-and left-handed conformations of both tetramers and hexamers. The handedness of the tetramers is dis-ordered but the orientation is ordered. The handedness of the hexamers is ordered but the orientation is disordered."
https://openalex.org/W2066737090,"The internal parasitoid Apanteles militaris is affected by a proteinaceous toxic factor in the hemolymph of granulosis virus-infected armyworm larva. The hemolymph, after centrifugation to remove the virus particles and inoculation into the larval hemocoel, is still toxic to the parasitoids."
https://openalex.org/W1990431481,"Corrections to the adopted values for centennial rates of change of four elements of the lunar orbit, the location of the FK4 equinox, and the obliquity of the ecliptic are presented. They are derived from analyses of lunar occultations distributed over several centuries. Generally, these corrections help to resolve existing discrepancies between theory and observations."

W., Science 123, 205 (10 Feb. 1956)] the word misrepresentation in the last sentence of the third paragraph is a typographical error. The sentence should read: ""In sharp contrast with many excellent recommendations of the Hoover Commission, this one seems to us to be completely wrong and probably to arise from a misinterpretation of the attaches' functions."""
