https://openalex.org/W2070853191,"I kappa B-alpha inhibits transcription factor NF-kappa B by retaining it in the cytoplasm. Various stimuli, typically those associated with stress or pathogens, rapidly inactivate I kappa B-alpha. This liberates NF-kappa B to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of genes important for the defense of the organism. Activation of NF-kappa B correlates with phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha and requires the proteolysis of this inhibitor. When either serine-32 or serine-36 of I kappa B-alpha was mutated, the protein did not undergo signal-induced phosphorylation or degradation, and NF-kappa B could not be activated. These results suggest that phosphorylation at one or both of these residues is critical for activation of NF-kappa B."
https://openalex.org/W2058491602,"Psychophysical measurements indicate that human subjects can store approximately seven short-term memories. Physiological studies suggest that short-term memories are stored by patterns of neuronal activity. Here it is shown that activity patterns associated with multiple memories can be stored in a single neural network that exhibits nested oscillations similar to those recorded from the brain. Each memory is stored in a different high-frequency (""40 hertz"") subcycle of a low-frequency oscillation. Memory patterns repeat on each low-frequency (5 to 12 hertz) oscillation, a repetition that relies on activity-dependent changes in membrane excitability rather than reverberatory circuits. This work suggests that brain oscillations are a timing mechanism for controlling the serial processing of short-term memories."
https://openalex.org/W2000894919,"bcl-x is a member of the bcl-2 gene family, which may regulate programmed cell death. Mice were generated that lacked Bcl-x. The Bcl-x-deficient mice died around embryonic day 13. Extensive apoptotic cell death was evident in postmitotic immature neurons of the developing brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. Hematopoietic cells in the liver were also apoptotic. Analyses of bcl-x double-knockout chimeric mice showed that the maturation of Bcl-x-deficient lymphocytes was diminished. The life-span of immature lymphocytes, but not mature lymphocytes, was shortened. Thus, Bcl-x functions to support the viability of immature cells during the development of the nervous and hematopoietic systems."

https://openalex.org/W1998514973,"The crystal structure of the tungsten-containing aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR) from Pyrococcus furiosus, a hyperthermophilic archaeon (formerly archaebacterium) that grows optimally at 100°C, has been determined at 2.3 angstrom resolution by means of multiple isomorphous replacement and multiple crystal form averaging. AOR consists of two identical subunits, each containing an Fe4S4 cluster and a molybdopterin-based tungsten cofactor that is analogous to the molybdenum cofactor found in a large class of oxotransferases. Whereas the general features of the tungsten coordination in this cofactor were consistent with a previously proposed structure, each AOR subunit unexpectedly contained two molybdopterin molecules that coordinate a tungsten by a total of four sulfur ligands, and the pterin system was modified by an intramolecular cyclization that generated a three-ringed structure. In comparison to other proteins, the hyperthermophilic enzyme AOR has a relatively small solvent-exposed surface area, and a relatively large number of both ion pairs and buried atoms. These properties may contribute to the extreme thermostability of this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1996899753,"The p53 protein is a tetrameric transcription factor that plays a central role in the prevention of neoplastic transformation. Oligomerization appears to be essential for the tumor suppressing activity of p53 because oligomerization-deficient p53 mutants cannot suppress the growth of carcinoma cell lines. The crystal structure of the tetramerization domain of p53 (residues 325 to 356) was determined at 1.7 angstrom resolution and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 19.2 percent. The monomer, which consists of a beta strand and an alpha helix, associates with a second monomer across an antiparallel beta sheet and an antiparallel helix-helix interface to form a dimer. Two of these dimers associate across a second and distinct parallel helix-helix interface to form the tetramer."

Vacuolar vesicles containing HMT1 are capable of taking up both apo-phytochelatins and phytochelatin-Cd2+ complexes. HMT1 activity is sensitive to antibodies directed against this protein and to vanadate, but not to inhibitors affecting the vacuolar proton ATPase or ionophores that abolish the pH gradient across the vacuolar membrane.

(ATP-binding cassette)-type proteins represent one of the largest known families of membrane transporters(1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). Members of this superfamily are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved nucleotide-binding domain that is associated with a more variable region capable of spanning the membrane multiple times. DNA sequence analysis indicated that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe hmt1 (heavy metal tolerance 1) gene, essential for Cd2+ tolerance, encodes an ABC-type protein(2Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic ABC-type polypeptides exhibit a duplicated structure, containing two transmembrane and two nucleotide-binding domains. HMT1, on the other hand, has only one of each. The few known eukaryotic ABC-type proteins that exhibit this nonduplicated arrangement reside in internal membranes: rat PMP70 (3Kamijo K. Taketani S. Yokota S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4534-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its human homologue (4Gartner J. Moser H. Valle D.

Townsend A. Trowsdale J. Nature. 1992; 357: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Previously we reported that an HMT1-β-galactosidase fusion protein was localized to the fission yeast vacuole(2Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).ABC-type proteins can mediate tolerance to a wide diversity of cytotoxic agents. Multiple drug resistance proteins from mammals (reviewed in (6Kane S.E. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 593-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and yeast (7Nishi K. Yoshida M. Nishimura M. Nishikawa M. Nishiyama Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Mol.

Leishmania IgptA confers tolerance to methotrexate and arsenite(9Callahan H.L. Beverley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18427-18430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a number of bacterial transporters are involved in resistance to antibiotics and environmental toxins (reviewed in (10Fath M.J. Kolter R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 995-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance is achieved by export of the toxic substances from the cell. The intracellular location of the HMT1-β-galactosidase chimera, on the other hand, suggested that this protein might represent the first example of an ABC-type transporter mediating resistance to a toxin by sequestration in an intracellular membrane-bound compartment. The nature of the substrate transported by HMT1, and its role in heavy metal tolerance of fission yeast were not clear.Plants and certain fungi, including S. pombe, respond to heavy metals by inducing synthesis of small peptides known as phytochelatins (PCs)(11Grill E. Winnacker E.L. Zenk M.H. Science. 1985; 230: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 12Steffens J.C. Hunt D.F. Williams B.G. J. Biol.

Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 339-359Google Scholar). Unlike metallothioneins, PCs are not produced by mRNA translation but are enzymatically synthesized from glutathione (GSH, γ-Glu-Cys-Gly). PCs have the general structure (γ-Glu-Cys)nGly, where n = 2-11, and like metallothioneins, chelate heavy metals by formation of thiolate bonds. Yeast and plant cells exposed to Cd2+ accumulate a low molecular weight (LMW) PC•Cd complex, consisting mostly of PCs and Cd2+, and a high molecular weight (HMW) PC•Cd•S−2 complex, containing acid labile sulfide (14Murasugi A. Wada C. Hayashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Reese R.N. White C.A. Winge D.R.

Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical analyses suggest that production of the sulfide moiety in the HMW PC•Cd•S−2 complex involves the purine biosynthetic pathway(17Speiser D.M. Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5301-5310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Juang H.R. McCue K.F. Ow D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The HMW complex, a CdS crystallite coated by PC peptides(19Dameron C.T. Reese R.N. Mehra R.K. Kortan A.R. Carrol P.J. Steigerwald M.L. Brus L.E. Winge D.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 596-597Crossref Scopus (631) Google Scholar), has a higher Cd2+-binding capacity than LMW PC•Cd, and the Cd2+ ions are less susceptible to acid displacement(20Reese R.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12832-12835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although detailed structures for HMW and LMW PC•Cd complexes are not available, it is clear that both are heterogeneous oligomeric aggregates containing multiple PC peptides of variable length.Since overexpression of hmt1 in yeast cells confers enhanced Cd2+ tolerance, as well as accumulation of the metal(2Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), it was postulated that HMT1 was involved in vacuolar sequestration of heavy metals or metal-peptide complexes. In this report we describe the localization of native HMT1 protein to vacuolar membranes and the discovery of an ATP-dependent PC transport activity in vacuolar membrane vesicles. We present evidence showing that HMT1 is responsible for this activity and describe the substrate specificity and energy requirements of this transporter. In addition, we observed Cd2+ and glutathione conjugate transport activities in fission yeast vacuolar vesicles lacking detectable amounts of HMT1 protein.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast StrainsThe S. pombe strain Sp223 (h-, ade6-216, leu1-32, ura4-294) is used as a wild type control in these experiments. The hmt1- mutant, LK100, was derived from Sp223 by ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutagenesis(2Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In most analyses LK100 contains either the yeast expression vector pART1 or pDH35 (pART1 containing an hmt1 cDNA)(2Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown at 30°C in S.D. (6.7 g of Difco yeast nitrogen base, 20 g of glucose/liter, adenine and uracil at 20 μg/ml).Antibodies Directed against HMT1A 760-base pair ClaI-MaeIII cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 553-806 of HMT1 was subcloned into the Qiagen pQIA16/17 vector system (pDH60). A 29-kDa His-tagged product, purified by Ni-agarose affinity chromatography from Escherichia coli, was used to immunize rabbits 622 and 623. Antisera 622 and 623 recognized a 29-kDa peptide in E. coli/pDH60 that was isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside inducible, but was not detected in E. coli/pQIA16. Preimmune sera failed to recognize this protein. IgG was purified from 622 and 623 antisera using Protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad).Plasmid pDH30(2Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), containing an hmt1 cDNA in the pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene), was used for in vitro transcription/translation by the TnT T7 system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]Met (1141 Ci/mmol, DuPont). Canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega) were added according to the manufacturer's instructions. Translation products were immunoprecipitated using Protein A-agarose or directly separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for fluorography.Isolation of Vacuole Membrane VesiclesS. pombe vacuolar vesicles were isolated as described previously (2Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. All buffers contain 2 mM benzamidine, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Spheroplasts were lysed in Buffer A (1.6 M sorbitol, 10 mM MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 0.5 mM MgCl2) with a glass homogenizer. Unlysed cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 min. A half-volume of Buffer B (Percoll containing 1.6 M sorbitol, 10 mM MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 1 mM MgCl2) was added to the supernatant (final Percoll concentration of 30%) and the vacuoles pelleted at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The vacuole pellet was resuspended in Buffer A with a homogenizer, mixed with a half-volume of Buffer B, layered on a cushion of equal volumes of Buffers A and B (50% Percoll), and pelleted as before. The vacuolar pellet was resuspended in Buffer C (100 mM KCl, 10 mM MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 5 mM MgCl2) and vacuolar membrane vesicles pelleted at 7,000 × g for 10 min. Vacuolar vesicles were resuspended in 0.5-1.5 ml of Buffer C containing 0.25 M sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen as 50-μl aliquots.Enzyme AssaysSpecific activities of marker enzymes were compared in total membranes and vacuolar membrane vesicles. To prepare total membranes for marker enzyme analysis, an aliquot of the 2,500 × g cell-free supernatant from the vacuolar preparation was diluted 10-fold with Buffer C and membranes pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The particulate fraction was resuspended in Buffer C with 0.25 M sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. α-Mannosidase, cytochrome c-reductase, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and ATPase activities were measured as described(21Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Succinate dehydrogenase (22Ackrell B.A.C. Kearney E.B. Singer T.P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 466-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and Golgi GDPase (23Seeger M. Payne G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) were determined as reported. Quenching of acridine orange fluorescence was measured with a Perkin Elmer LS5 Fluorescence spectrometer(24Crider B.P. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17379-17381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that EDTA was omitted from the reaction buffer. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) containing 0.05% CHAPS. The values obtained by modified Lowry assay on trichloroacetic acid-precipitated material were not significantly different from those generated with the Bradford assay.Synthesis and Purification of SubstratesSp223 cells grown in 800 ml of S.D. to an A600 of 0.6-0.8 were incubated with 0.25 mCi/liter of [35S]Cys (Amersham, 1300 Ci/mmol) and 0.4 mM CdSO4 for 8 h. Cells were lysed with glass beads in 1.5 volumes of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CdCl2, 0.5% isoamyl alcohol and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Elution of PC•Cd complexes from DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with a linear KCl gradient (0.2-0.5 M, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6) generated two well resolved peaks of 35S-labeled material. Extracts labeled with 109CdCl2 instead of [35S]Cys produced an identical column profile. 35S-Labeled fractions were reduced in volume to 4 ml in vacuo and applied to a Sephadex G-50 column as described(2Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The positions of 35S peaks in the G-50 elution profile were consistent with purification of HMW and LMW PC•Cd complexes. These peaks could also be labeled by addition of a 109CdCl2 tracer to the sample before loading. Concentrated G-50 column fractions, desalted by Sephadex G-10 chromatography, were used in transport studies. HPLC analysis of the PC•Cd complexes (essentially as described in (25Dameron C.T. Smith B.R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17355-17360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that trifluoroacetic acid was substituted with 0.1% H3PO4) indicated that the PCs were mostly of n = 2-3, in agreement with Grill et al.(26Grill E. Winnacker E.L. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1986; 197: 115-120Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and did not contain GSH. Apo-PCs were prepared from the LMW [35S]PC•Cd complex by acidification to pH 2.0 with 1 N HCl followed by HPLC separation(20Reese R.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12832-12835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled HPLC fractions were neutralized and desalted by Sephadex G-10 chromatography. The LMW [35S]PC•Cd complex reconstituted from apo-PCs and Cd2+ was indistinguishable from the native complex by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration or as a substrate in transport assays. A LMW [35S]PC•Cd complex could also be derived from purified HMW [35S]PC•Cd•S−2 complex by acidification with 1 N HCl to pH 2.0 in the presence of 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol(20Reese R.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12832-12835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After out-gassing the evolved H2S, the reaction was neutralized using NaOH, and subjected to Sephadex G-50 gel chromatography. Greater than 90% of the counts present in the HMW [35S]PC•Cd•S−2 complex were recovered from G-50 as a peak indistinguishable from the native LMW [35S]PC•Cd complex. This same peak could also be labeled by addition of a 109Cd tracer. PC concentration was measured with Ellman's reagent (27Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar) and interpolated on a GSH standard curve. Because native PC•Cd complexes are heterogeneous regarding number of peptides per complex and length of peptides, PC concentrations are reported as GSH equivalents. Unlabeled PC•Cd complexes were prepared in essentially the same manner. Cd2+ content of column fractions was quantified by atomic absorption spectroscopy as described previously (2Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). 109Cd was incorporated into LMW PC•Cd complexes of known Cd2+ and thiol concentration by incubation with 109CdCl2 for 30 min on ice. Free Cd2+ ions were separated from the LMW [109Cd]PC•Cd complex by G-10 chromatography.[3H]GSSG was prepared from [3H]GSH (300 mCi/mmol, DuPont)(28Kondo T. Dale G.L. Beutler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6359-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione conjugate (GSDNP) was enzymatically synthesized from 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Sigma) and [3H]GSH by glutathione S-transferase (Sigma)(29Awasti Y.C. Garg H.S. Dao D.D. Partridge C.A. Srivastava S.K. Blood. 1981; 58: 733-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]GSDNP was separated from its precursors by thin layer chromatography and quantified by absorbance at 340 nm.Vesicle Filtration AssayVesicle filtration assays were performed at 30°C in 10 mM MES-Tris, pH 7.8, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM creatine phosphate, and 100 μg/ml creatine kinase (Buffer D). 50 μl of thawed vacuolar vesicles (20-50 μg of protein) were resuspended in 200 μl of Buffer D, ATP added to a final concentration of 3 mM, and 50 μl of radiolabeled substrate added 30 s later. At the times indicated in the figures, 50-μl aliquots from the reaction were diluted to 1 ml with ice-cold Buffer D, filtered immediately under light vacuum through a 25-mm GF-C filter (Whatman), and washed with 5 ml of Buffer D. For Cd2+ transport, 50 μl of 48 μM109CdCl2, 100 mCi/mmol (DuPont) was used (8 μM final concentration), and the wash contained 2 mM CdCl2 to reduce nonspecific binding of Cd2+ to membranes. For [3H]GSDNP uptake studies, a final concentration of 50 μM GSDNP was used. For PC uptake studies, a solution containing 50,000 cpm of 35S-labeled PCs (4-8 μM GSH equivalents) was used. For measurement of [109Cd]PC•Cd uptake, the LMW [109Cd]PC•Cd substrate was present at a final concentration of 8 μM Cd2+ and 16.4 μM GSH equivalents. For antibody inhibition of PC uptake, an aliquot of vacuolar vesicles was mixed with Buffer D and incubated on ice for 1 h with preimmune serum, no antibody, or 300 μg of IgG derived from either antiserum 622 or 623. ATP and PC substrates were added and the vesicle filtration assay conducted as above.RESULTShmt1 Encodes a 90-kDa Vacuolar Membrane ProteinAn HMT1-β-galactosidase fusion protein had previously been localized to the vacuolar membrane of S. pombe(2Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, reports indicating that hyperproduction of a membrane protein may result in mislocalization to the vacuole (30Cooper A. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and that the vacuolar membrane may represent the default sorting pathway for yeast membrane proteins (31Roberts C.J. Nophwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) suggested that addition of the 105-kDa β-galactosidase peptide to the carboxyl terminus of HMT1 may have altered its subcellular sorting. Therefore, the intracellular location of native HMT1 remained uncertain.A 29-kDa peptide, encompassing most of the HMT1 ATP-binding cassette domain, was synthesized in E. coli, purified, and used to raise antibodies (antisera 622 and 623). Both antisera recognized a 90-kDa protein in S. pombe (Fig. 1A) that was not detected by preimmune sera and is consistent with the 90.5-kDa molecular mass predicted for HMT1. The 90-kDa protein was associated with the P100 (100,000 × g precipitable) particulate fraction of S. pombe extracts (lane g), but is not detected in the S100 supernatant (lane e), as expected of an integral membrane protein.Vacuoles were prepared from S. pombe spheroplasts as described under “Materials and Methods.” Compared to the particulate fraction of a total cellular extract, purified vacuolar vesicles are highly enriched in vacuolar marker enzymes and impoverished in markers for mitochondrial, Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membranes (Table 1). In the immunoblot in Fig. 1A, lanes loaded with vacuolar membranes (Fig. 1A, lanes a and b) exhibited enrichment of the hmt1 product when compared with total cellular membranes (lanes f and g) despite containing 25-fold less protein. The supernatant overlying the vacuolar pellet was impoverished in HMT1 (lane d), suggesting that this protein is sorted primarily to the vacuolar membrane. Cd2+ treatment of wild type cultures did not alter levels of the 90-kDa protein (not shown).Tabled 1The 90-kDa polypeptide was not detected in total (lane h), or vacuolar (lane c), membranes derived from the Cd2+-sensitive LK100 strain, which bears an hmt1- allele with a nonsense mutation in the 5′ region of the gene(2Ortiz D.F.

The apparent Mr of hmt1 translation products obtained with Triton X-100 and canine microsomes was the same, suggesting that the hmt1 gene product was not glycosylated in vitro upon insertion into microsomes. The in vitro translation product also co-migrated with the 90-kDa band present in vacuolar membrane extracts (see Fig. 1B), suggesting that HMT1 may not be glycosylated in vivo either. Translation products were immunoprecipitated with antisera 622 and 623 but not preimmune sera (Fig. 2B). In addition to the 90-kDa product, several smaller peptides generated in the transcription/translation reaction were also recognized by the antisera. Since the antibodies are directed to the carboxyl-terminal ABC domain of HMT1, the smaller products could derive from use of cryptic transcription and/or translation start signals present in the hmt1 cDNA. Highly hydrophobic proteins are translated far less efficiently than soluble polypeptides (up to 40-fold lower than the luciferase and S. pombe ade2 gene products). Use of the next downstream ATG codon, encoding Met-318, as a translational start site would generate a truncated peptide lacking the most hydrophobic region of HMT1. The Mr of seven of the eight smaller peptides present in the translation reaction mixture match the sizes predicted if downstream Met codons were used as intragenic translational start sites. Production of these smaller peptides is not dependent on microsomes or detergent; therefore, their translation might be more efficient than that of the full-length HMT1.Figure 2:In vitro transcription/translation of hmt1 cDNA.

Vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from mutant (LK100/pART) and HMT1 hyperproducing (LK100/pDH35) strains were tested for uptake of radioactively labeled substrates by the standard vesicle filtration assay. Vesicles derived from the HMT1 hyperproducer exhibited ATP-dependent uptake of in vivo labeled LMW [35S]PC•Cd complex (Fig. 3A). No activity was observed at 0°C, in the absence of ribonucleotides, or with AMP, ADP, or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP. Inclusion of a creatine kinase/creatine phosphate ATP-regeneration system resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in initial uptake velocity and maintained linearity of uptake for a longer period of time. LMW PC•Cd uptake has a Km for ATP of 0.38 ± 0.01 mM (Fig. 4). 3 mM UTP, CTP, or GTP sustained 97 ± 3, 62 ± 1, or 54 ± 1%, respectively, of the initial velocity measured with 3 mM ATP in the absence of a regeneration system. Addition of Triton X-100 to vesicles loaded with radiolabeled PCs resulted in a decrease of 35S counts retained on the filter. Furthermore, a decrease in the initial velocity of [35S]PC uptake was observed upon reduction of the internal vesicle space (Fig. 5), suggesting that PCs were transported into the vacuolar vesicles rather than binding to the outside of the membrane.Figure 3:Uptake of 35S-labeled PC•Cd complexes by purified vacuolar membrane vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W2079311079,"Desensitization is a phenomenon that is common to many ligand-gated ion channels but has been demonstrated only rarely with physiological stimulation. Numerous studies describe desensitization of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor by exogenous agonists, but whether synaptic stimulation causes desensitization has been unknown. Synaptic stimulation of NMDA receptors on rat hippocampal neurons resulted in desensitization that was prevented by intracellular 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP-gamma-S), or inhibitors of phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), but not by inhibitors of phosphatases 1 and 2A or of tyrosine phosphatases. Synaptic NMDA receptors may fluctuate between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms, depending on the rate of synaptic stimulation and the magnitude of the associated influx of calcium through NMDA receptors."

In this study the dephosphorylation of sparingly soluble PHF, PHF II-τ by brain protein phosphatase (PP)-2A1 and PP-2B, and the resulting biochemical, biological, and structural alterations were investigated. Both of the phosphatases dephosphorylated PHF II-τ at the sites of Ser-199/Ser-202 and partially dephosphorylated it at Ser-396/Ser-404; in addition, PHF II-τ was dephosphorylated at Ser-46 by PP-2A1 and Ser-235 by PP-2B. The relative electrophoretic mobility of PHF II-τ increased after dephosphorylation by either enzyme. Divalent cations, manganese, and magnesium increased the activities of PP-2A1 and PP-2B toward PHF II-τ. Dephosphorylation both by PP-2B and PP-2A1 decreased the resistance of PHF II-τ to proteolysis by the brain calcium-activated neutral proteases (CANP). The ability of PHF II-τ to promote the in vitro microtubule assembly was restored after dephosphorylation by PP-2A1 and PP-2B. Microtubules assembled by the dephosphorylated PHF II-τ were structurally identical to those assembled by bovine τ used as a control. The dephosphorylation both by PP-2A1 and PP-2B caused dissociation of the tangles and the PHF; some of the PHF dissociated into straight protofilaments/subfilaments. Approximately 25% of the total τ was released from PHF on dephosphorylation by PP-2A1. These observations demonstrate that PHF II-τ is accessible to dephosphorylation by PP-2A1 and PP-2B, and dephosphorylation makes PHF dissociate, accessible to proteolysis by CANP, and biologically active in promoting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules.

PHF exist as neurofibrillary tangles in neuronal cell bodies, as neuropil threads in the dystrophic neurites of affected neurons, and in degenerating neurites surrounding the extracellular amyloid in neuritic (senile) plaques. Microtubule-associated protein τ is the major protein subunit of PHF (Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986a; Iqbal et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991). τ in AD brain, especially PHF, is abnormally phosphorylated (Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986b; Iqbal et al., 1986, 1989; Lee et al., 1991). The abnormally phosphorylated τ from AD brain contains 5-9 mol of phosphate/mol of the protein, which is about three to four times the level of phosphate in normal brain τ (Köpke et al., 1993). PHF-τ is phosphorylated at multiple sites (Iqbal et al., 1989). So far 21 abnormal phosphorylation sites of PHF-τ (all Ser/Thr sites) have been identified either by phosphorylation-dependent antibodies (Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986b; Iqbal et al., 1989; Brion et al., 1991; Lee et al., 1991; Biernat et al., 1992; Lichtenberg-Kraag et al., 1992; Kanemaru et al., 1992) or by mass spectrometry (Hasegawa et al., 1992; Morishima-Kawashima et al., 1995). Most of the phosphates are clustered aet two sites, one amino-terminal (Ser-198 to Thr-217) and one carboxyl-terminal (Ser-396 to Ser-422) to the microtubule-binding repeat domains (Gln-244 to Gly-367); numbering according to the largest isoform, τ441 (Goedert et al., 1989). As a result of the abnormal hyperphosphorylation, the apparent molecular weight of PHF-τ on SDS-polyacrylamide gels is higher than that of normal τ (Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1986b; Iqbal et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991). Furthermore, PHF-τ does not promote the assembly of tubulin into microtubules unless it is dephosphorylated prior to its interaction with tubulin (Iqbal et al., 1994). Alzheimer disease abnormally phosphorylated τ from AD brain sedimenting at 27,000-200,000 × g, soluble and reactive with τ-1 antibody only after dephosphorylation calcium-activated neutral protease(s) paired helical filaments τ in PHF that are sparingly soluble in SDS protein phosphatase-2A or −2B 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. τ from AD brain can be biochemically isolated into three populations (Köpke et al., 1993): (i) non-abnormally phosphorylated cytosolic τ (C-τ), (ii) soluble abnormally phosphorylated τ (AD P-τ) and, (iii) abnormally phosphorylated τ polymerized into PHF (PHF-τ). Based on the solubility, PHF-τ can be further classified into two species: PHF I-τ and PHF II-τ. PHF I-τ is readily soluble in 2.0% SDS, whereas PHF II-τ requires ultrasonication and heating in SDS for extractions (Iqbal et al., 1984). Pathologically, these species of τ may reflect different stages of neuronal degeneration in AD brain, that is, normal τ (C-τ) first becomes abnormally hyperphosphorylated (AD P-τ) and then by a presently unknown mechanism becomes polymerized into PHF (PHF-τ); unlike AD P-τ and PHF I-τ, PHF II-τ also becomes partly ubiquitinated (Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1988; Morishima-Kawashima et al., 1993). Phosphoseryl and phosphothreonyl protein phosphatases, which are classified into four major types, i.e. PP-1, PP-2A, PP-2B, and PP-2C (for review, see Cohen(1989)), are present in significant amounts in human brain (Gong et al., 1993). We have previously found that PP-2C is not active toward any abnormal sites of AD P-τ, whereas PP-1 is only effective toward two of the epitopes investigated (Gong et al., 1994b). Therefore, PP-2A and PP-2B are the most probable candidate phosphatases involved in the abnormal phosphorylation of τ in AD and for this reason were chosen for this study. Previous studies have shown that AD P-τ can be dephosphorylated by PP-2A1 (equally well by PP-2A1 and PP-2A2) and PP-2B at several abnormal phosphorylation sites (Gong et al., 1994a and 1994c), implying that the neurodegenerative changes in AD in their early stage might be reversible. In the present study, dephosphorylation of PHF II-τ, a late stage of Alzheimer neurofibrillary pathology (Bancher et al., 1989; Köpke et al., 1993) by brain PP-2A1 and PP-2B and the resulting biochemical, biological, and structural alterations were investigated. PHF II-τ were found to be partially accessible to dephosphorylation by PP-2A1 and PP-2B, and treatment with these phosphatases caused dissociation of PHF/tangles, decreased the protease resistance, and restored the microtubule assembly-promoting activity of PHF II-τ. Human brains employed for this study were obtained within 6 h postmortem and stored frozen at −75°C until used. Protein phosphatase 2A1 and 2B were purified from bovine brain according to the methods described by Cohen et al.(1988) and Sharma et al.(1983), respectively. CANP (a mixture of micro- and millimolar calcium-dependent enzymes) was purified from calf brain by the procedure described previously (Malik et al., 1983). Polyclonal antibody 92e and 102c were raised as reported previously (Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1988; Iqbal et al., 1989). Monoclonal antibodies τ-1 and PHF-1 were provided by Drs. L. I. Binder (Binder et al., 1985) and S. Greenberg (Greenberg et al., 1992), respectively. SMI31, SMI33, and SMI34 were purchased from Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Baltimore, MD. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. 125I-Labeled donkey anti-rabbit whole antibody was from Amersham (Arlington, IL). PHF II were isolated from histopathologically confirmed AD brains according to the long procedure of Iqbal et al.(1984). Briefly, cerebral cortex, cleaned free of white matter and meninges, was fractionated by a combination of sieving through nylon bolting cloth, treatment with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and by discontinuous sucrose density gradients and glass beads chromatography. AD P-τ was isolated from the 27,000 × g to 200,000 × g fraction of the Alzheimer brain homogenate by extraction in 8 M urea, followed by acid precipitation and dialysis against Mes buffer as described previously (Köpke et al., 1993). This AD P-τ-enriched fraction is readily soluble in SDS-free buffer. Normal human τ was purified as described previously (Köpke et al., 1993) from 35-45% ammonium sulfate precipitates of the 200,000 × g brain supernatant, followed by acid treatment (pH 2.7) and chromatography on a phosphocellulose column (Cellulose phosphate P11, Whatman). Unless otherwise specified, the dephosphorylation of PHF II-τ was carried out at 37°C for 45 min in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 1.0 mM MnCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 70 μg/ml PHF II-τ either with 2.0 units/ml PP-2A1 or 5.0 units/ml PP-2B (one unit of PP-2A1 or PP-2B is defined as the amount of the enzyme that releases 1.0 nmol of phosphate/min from [32P]phosphorylase a or [32P]phosphorylase kinase at 30°C, respectively). The reaction mixture for dephosphorylation by PP-2B also included 1.0 mM CaCl2 and 1 μM calmodulin. Dephosphorylation of AD P-τ was carried out under identical conditions as that of PHF II-τ, except with lower concentrations of the phosphatases (see Fig. 2). The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme and terminated by precipitation with 4 volumes of cold acetone. Dephosphorylation was detected by Western blots as described below. The precipitated protein samples were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated in boiling water for 5 min, followed by 5-15% gradient SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (1970). Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1984, 1986b). The dilution of the primary antibodies used and their epitopes are shown in Table 1. The blots were developed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate p-toluidine salt and p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride as substrates.Tabled 1 PHFs, untreated or treated with 2 units/ml PP-2A1 for 3 h at 37°C, as described above, in the presence or absence of 10 μM okadaic acid, were centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g. The pellet was washed once as above. The total protein in the pellet and the two combined supernatants was measured by the method of Bensadoun and Weinstein(1976). The amount of τ in these fractions was determined by the radioimmuno-dot blot assay of Khatoon et al.(1992). Polyclonal anti-τ antibody 92e (1:2500) and 125I-labeled donkey anti-rabbit whole antibody (0.1 μg/ml) were employed as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively, for developing the blots. The effect of dephosphorylation on the CANP proteolysis of PHF II-τ was studied as follows. PHF II-τ were dephosphorylated with either PP-2A1 or PP-2B as described above, except that protease inhibitor leupeptin was excluded. The dephosphorylation reaction was terminated by boiling the assay mixture for 5 min and the proteolysis reaction was initiated by adding a final concentration of 0.5 mM CaCl2 and 0.25 unit/ml CANP. One unit of CANP activity is defined as the amount of the enzyme which catalyzed an increase of 1.0 absorbance unit at 280 nm in 1 h at 37°C by using dimethylated casein (Sigma, C9801) as a substrate (Kawashima et al., 1984). Aliquots were removed at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 180 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 volumes of cold acetone. Aliquots from each sample containing 2.0 μg of PHF II-τ protein were electrophoresed on 5-15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with polyclonal antibody 92e. PHF II-τ, untreated or treated with PP-2A1 or PP-2B as described above, were washed first with phosphate buffer and then with assembly buffer followed by ultrasonication and extraction of τ as described previously (Iqbal et al., 1994). Rat brain tubulin was isolated through two temperature-dependent cycles of microtubule polymerization-depolymerization (Shelanski et al., 1973) followed by phosphocellulose ion-exchange column chromatography (Sloboda and Rosenbaum, 1979). The in vitro microtubule assembly was carried out by incubating, at 37°C in 1-cm quartz microcuvettes, rat tubulin (3.0 mg/ml) with extracted τ (0.2 mg/ml) in an assembly buffer containing 100 mM Mes, 1 mM EGTA, and 2 mM GTP. The assembly was followed up to 15 min by recording the turbidimetric changes at 350 nm in a Cary 1 spectrophotometer. At the end of the assembly reaction, aliquots of the incubation mixture were examined by negative stain electron microscopy as described previously for microtubules (Wisniewski et al., 1984; Iqbal et al., 1986). The effect of dephosphorylation on the structure of PHF II was examined by negative stain electron microscopy as described previously (Wisniewski et al., 1984; Köpke et al., 1993). Each experiment on the effect of dephosphorylation on the structure of PHF was carried out at least two times. Using a panel of phosphorylation-dependent, site-specific antibodies (Table 1), we found that both PP-2A1 (2.0 units/ml) and PP-2B (5.0 units/ml) unblocked antibody τ-1 epitope (Fig. 1a), suggesting that the enzymes dephosphorylated PHF II-τ at Ser-199/Ser-202. In addition, PP-2A1 and PP-2B dephosphorylated, respectively, Ser-46 (Fig. 1b) and Ser-235 (Fig. 1c) as determined by immunostaining with antibodies 102c and SMI33. Both of the enzymes partially masked SMI31 (Fig. 1d) and SMI34 (Fig. 1e) epitopes, indicating that they partially dephosphorylated Ser-396/Ser-404 and changed the conformation of τ in PHF II. The dephosphorylation of PHF II-τ at Ser-396/Ser-404 by either enzyme was less obvious with PHF-1 than that seen with SMI31 antibody (Fig. 1f). Immunoblot with polyclonal τ antibody 92e showed an electrophoretic mobility shift in τ after dephosphorylation by PP-2A1 or PP-2B (Fig. 1g). These results revealed that τ in PHF II can be selectively dephosphorylated in vitro by PP-2A1 and PP-2B. Dephosphorylation by PP-2B was unable to unmask τ-1 epitope of PHF II-τ at a concentration of 1.0 unit/ml, and dephosphorylation by PP-2A1 at 0.5 unit/ml resulted in a weak immunostaining. The maximal labeling of PHF II-τ with τ-1 was obtained at a concentration of either 2.0 units/ml PP-2A1 or 5.0 units/ml PP-2B (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, PP-2A1 and PP-2B readily dephosphorylated AD P-τ at τ-1 site at the concentration of 0.1 unit/ml and 0.36 unit/ml, respectively, although the extent of the dephosphorylation was increased with the increase of the enzyme concentration up to 1.0 unit/ml PP-2A1 and 3.6 units/ml PP-2B (Fig. 2b). No inhibitory activity toward the phosphatases was found in PHF II-τ sample (data not shown). These results indicated that compared with AD P-τ, PHF II-τ is a less favorable substrate for dephosphorylation by PP-2A1 and PP-2B. Additionally, PP-2A1 is more active than PP-2B toward PHF II-τ. Manganese activated the dephosphorylation of PHF II-τ by PP-2A1 or PP-2B (Fig. 3, a and b, compare lanes 2, 3, and 4 with lane 11). The activity increased with the increase of manganese concentration and appeared to reach the maximal at the concentration of 0.1 mM, both in the case of PP-2A1 and PP-2B. Magnesium stimulated the activity of both enzymes at concentrations of 1.0 mM and 10.0 mM but not at 0.1 mM (Fig. 3, a and b, compare lanes 5, 6, and 7 with lane 11). Calcium and calmodulin activated PP-2B (Fig. 3b, compare lane 8 with lane 11). However, higher activity was obtained when manganese or magnesium were also included (Fig. 3b, compare lanes 9 and 10 with lane 8 and with lane 11). PP-2A1 activity was minimally affected by polylysine (Fig. 3a, compare lanes 8, 9, and 10 with lane 11). The data suggested that Mn2+ and Mg2+ stimulated PP-2A1 and PP-2B, Ca2+/calmodulin-activated PP-2B, whereas polylysine minimally promoted PP-2A1 activity. PHF II-τ could not be digested by CANP in 3 h (Fig. 4a). In contrast, PHF II-τ dephosphorylated by PP-2A1 (Fig. 4b) or PP-2B (Fig. 4c) showed significant proteolysis after incubation with CANP for 3 h. These results suggested that PHF II-τ is resistant to proteolysis by CANP, and prior dephosphorylation of PHF II-τ by PP-2A1 or PP-2B can decrease this resistance considerably. Incubation at 37°C of nondephosphorylated PHF II-τ (PHF control) with rat tubulin in the assembly buffer generated a lower turbidimetric reading than tubulin control (Fig. 5), and no microtubules were seen by electron microscopy (Fig. 6b). In contrast, incubation of rat tubulin with PHF II-τ dephosphorylated by either PP-2A1 or PP-2B generated a markedly increased turbidity at 350 nm (Fig. 5), and large numbers of microtubules were seen by negative stain electron microscopy (Fig. 6, c and d). No ultrastructural difference could be observed between the microtubules assembled by bovine τ used as a control (Fig. 6a) and those by dephosphorylated PHF II-τ (Fig. 6, c and d).Figure 6:Electron micrographs showing the products of microtubule assembly negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid. Aliquots of each sample (from Fig. 5) were taken at steady state of polymerization and stained negatively with 2% phosphotungstic acid as described under “Materials and Methods.” Large numbers of microtubules from tubulin were observed in the presence of bovine τ and PP-2A1- and PP-2B-treated PHF (a, c, and d, respectively); no microtubules were seen in the presence of nondephosphorylated PHF II-τ (b), and an occasional microtubule could be observed in the tubulin alone control (not shown). No ultrastructural differences were observed among microtubules assembled with the bovine control τ and the phosphatases-treated PHF II-τ. Bar, 0.5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The negative stain electron microscopy revealed a dissociation of the neurofibrillary tangles after incubation of PHF II-τ with PP-2A1 (Fig. 7b) or PP-2B (Fig. 7c) at 37°C for 45 min. The PHF tangles dissociated into individual PHF, and the twists in PHF started becoming less defined. Further dissociation of the PHF and the tangles was seen by 3-h dephosphorylation either by PP-2A1 (Fig. 7e) or by PP-2B (Fig. 7f). An increasing dissociation of the tangles into individual PHF and dissociation of PHF into straight subfilaments/protofilaments was frequently seen in the 3-h dephosphorylated samples, but not in the no phosphatase added control samples (Fig. 7d). Quantitation by radioimmuno-dot blots revealed a net release of approximately 25% of total τ from PHF following dephosphorylation by PP-2A1 (Table 2).Tabled 1 One of the most characteristic brain lesions of AD is the formation of PHF in the affected neurons. The abnormal phosphorylation of τ probably precedes its polymerization into PHF (Bancher et al., 1989; Köpke et al., 1993). Previously, we have demonstrated that this pre-PHF abnormal τ, AD P-τ, can be dephosphorylated at several abnormal phosphorylation sites by PP-2A1 and PP-2B (Gong et al., 1994c, 1994a) and that both of these enzymes are localized in neurons, including neurons predilected for neurofibrillary tangles (Pei et al., 1994). Furthermore, Drewes et al.(1993) have reported that the τ extracted from PHF by detergents and made soluble can be dephosphorylated at the AT8 site (this antibody recognizes Ser-199/Ser-202 when phosphorylated) by PP-2A and PP-2B. In the present study, we have investigated whether τ polymerized into PHF/neurofibrillary tangles is also accessible to protein phosphatases and have examined the effect of dephosphorylation on the structure, proteolysis, and the biological activity of τ in PHF. We found (i) that PHF II-τ can be dephosphorylated at Ser-46 by PP-2A1, at Ser-235 by PP-2B, and at Ser-199/Ser-202 and partially at Ser-396/Ser-404 by both PP-2A1 and PP-2B; (ii) that the dephosphorylation of PHF II-τ by either phosphatase decreases its resistance to proteolysis by CANP; (iii) that the dephosphorylation of PHF II-τ with either phosphatase restores its biological activity as determined by the microtubule assembly-promoting activity; and (iv) that the dephosphorylation leads to a dissociation of the neurofibrillary tangles and individual PHF into straight protofilaments and release of τ. These data suggest that not only soluble abnormally phosphorylated τ but also the τ polymerized into PHF is accessible, although to a lesser degree, to the protein phosphatases PP-2A1 and PP-2B, and on dephosphorylation with these enzymes the structure of PHF dissociates and τ becomes biologically active and can be proteolyzed by CANP. Compared with AD P-τ, PHF II-τ is less amenable to dephosphorylation by PP-2A1 and PP-2B. The phosphates at τ-1 epitope in AD P-τ were readily removed by 0.1 unit/ml PP-2A1 or 0.36 unit/ml PP-2B, whereas for PHF II-τ, 2.0 units/ml PP-2A1 or 5.0 units/ml PP-2B were required for maximal dephosphorylation at the same epitope. Pathologically, AD P-τ and PHF II-τ may reflect, respectively, an early stage and a late stage of AD neurofibrillary degeneration. The structural state of τ in PHF might be responsible for its decreased accessibility to the phosphatases. The same reason may also explain why AD P-τ can be dephosphorylated at the abnormal sites Ser-396/Ser-404 by PP-2A and PP-2B (Gong et al., 1994a, 1994c), whereas PHF II-τ can be only partially dephosphorylated at these sites. The exact reason for the relative resistance of Ser-396/Ser-404 sites for dephosphorylation in PHF II-τ by PP-2A1, and PP-2B is at present not known. It is likely that the carboxyl-terminal region of the abnormally phosphorylated τ is buried into the PHF polymer and is less accessible to the phosphatases. The effect of divalent cations on the phosphatase activities showed that Mn2+ stimulated PP-2A1 and PP-2B at the concentration of 0.01 mM, whereas 1.0 mM Mg2+ was required for comparable activities. These concentrations of Mn2+ and Mg2+ are in the physiological range (Friberg et al., 1986). The stimulation of the phosphatase activities by these metals might have physiological and therapeutic significance. Using soluble AD P-τ as a substrate and rat brain phosphatase as an enzyme source, we (Gong et al., 1994a, 1994c) demonstrated previously that in vitro PP-2B was more active than PP-2A. Similar results were reported by Drewes et al. (1993). In the present study, we found that bovine brain PP-2A1 was more active than PP-2B toward PHF II-τ, suggesting that both PP-2A1 and PP-2B might play a role in the abnormal phosphorylation of τ and that the differences between the previous and the present studies might be related to the use of different substrates and possibly different enzyme sources. Although the mechanism for PHF formation and accumulation as tangles remains largely unknown, one can postulate that an impaired proteolysis of abnormally phosphorylated τ might be related to this pathological processing. Previous studies have shown that PHF is extremely protease-resistant (Grundke-Iqbal et al., 1988; Wischik et al., 1988). In the present study we have found that dephosphorylation of PHF II-τ by PP-2A1 and PP-2B increases its proteolysis by CANP. These findings suggest that abnormal phosphorylation of PHF-τ might be involved in its increased resistance to CANP digestion, and this abnormal phosphorylation-induced inhibition of τ proteolysis by CANP can be reversed by the dephosphorylation of the abnormal τ by PP-2A1 and PP-2B. We also found that dephosphorylated AD P-τ was degraded significantly more rapidly and extensively than PHF II-τ (data not shown). These differences in the CANP proteolysis of AD P-τ and PHF II-τ might be related to the nonpolymeric state and a more complete dephosphorylation of the former than the latter. Interestingly, it was also found that normal human τ was rapidly digested by the CANP used in this study but not by that purchased from Sigma (data not shown). Johnson et al.(1989) also reported that τ purified from total brain heat-stable fraction was resistant to degradation by the CANP from Sigma. The CANP from Sigma was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and only contained the millimolar type of CANP, whereas the CANP used in the present study was purified from calf brain and contained both millimolar and micromolar types of CANP. Thus, the difference in the activities of CANP toward τ between the Sigma enzyme and the enzyme used in the present study might be either due to the tissue specificity or the type specificity or both; tissue-specific CANP have been reported recently (Sorimachi et al., 1994). Previous studies have shown that soluble abnormally phosphorylated τ and PHF II-τ isolated from AD brain had no microtubule assembly activity. However, when this τ was extensively dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase, the microtubule assembly-promoting activity was restored (Alonso et al., 1994; Iqbal et al., 1994). In the present study, we found that partial dephosphorylation of PHF II-τ by protein phosphatase 2A1 or 2B also restored its biological activity in promoting the in vitro microtubule assembly. The assembly activity of the PP-2A1-treated sample as determined by the turbidimetric changes was much higher than that of the PP-2B-treated sample. These findings suggest (i) that the phosphorylation of τ at Ser-235, a site dephosphorylated by PP-2B, and not by PP-2A1, might not be involved in the microtubule assembly-promoting activity; and (ii) that one or more selective sites that are dephosphorylated by PP-2A1 but not by PP-2B might enhance the microtubule assembly activity. The nature of these differences, which will be investigated in a separate study, is, at present, not known. Although the turbidity is significantly higher in the PP-2A1-treated sample than PP-2B-treated sample, no obvious difference in the structure of microtubules was seen by the negative stain electron microscopy. PHF are ultrastructurally distinct from elements of normal neuronal cytoskeleton, i.e. microtubules and neurofilaments. PHF have a diameter of 22-24 nm, which narrows to ∼10 nm at every 80-nm interval (Kidd, 1964; Wisniewski et al., 1984). In this study, we observed that dephosphorylation of PHF by either PP-2A1 or PP-2B dissociated PHF tangles, and this dissociation became more significant with the increase in dephosphorylation. During the first 45 min of dephosphorylation, dissociation of PHF from the neurofibrillary tangles and a decrease in the discernability of the twists of PHF were observed. After the dephosphorylation for 3 h, a fewer number of the tangles and PHF and a concomitant release of τ was observed. Furthermore, an increasing number of PHF were found to lose their twist and were dissociated into straight protofilaments. Although the role of phosphorylation in the polymerization of τ into PHF is not understood, the present study suggests that dephosphorylation by PP-2A1 and PP-2B might reverse this lesion. In conclusion, the present study reveals that τ in PHF II is biologically inactive and protease-resistant. However, PHF in neurofibrillary tangles are accessible to dephosphorylation at some sites by PP-2A1 and PP-2B. Dephosphorylation of PHF-τ restores the microtubule assembly-promoting activity, increases the proteolysis by CANP, and dissociates the neurofibrillary tangles and the PHF. Dephosphorylation might inhibit and reverse the neurofibrillary degeneration in AD brain. We thank Dr. Toolsee J. Singh for critical reading of the manuscript; Dr. M. Malik and M. D.

Nonglycosylated MPO precursors synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin did not interact with CRT. The CRT-apopro-MPO interaction was restricted to an early phase of MPO biosynthesis, and CRT did not interact with the later appearing, heme-containing species of MPO, i.e. pro-MPO or the heavy subunit of mature MPO. These data show that CRT participates in the posttranslational processing of MPO, perhaps by maintaining apopro-MPO in a conformation competent to accommodate insertion of the heme group.

The most efficient microbicidal system employed by PMNs depends on two elements: reactive oxygen species generated by the NADPH-dependent oxidase (3Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 161: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), a heme-containing protein present in the azurophilic granules of PMNs(4Klebanoff S.J.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-36Google Scholar). Within the phagolysosome of the activated PMN, these species interact to produce HOCl and exert microbicidal activity(5Klebanoff S.J. Everse J. Everse K. Grisham M. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-36Google Scholar).MPO (donor:H2O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.7) has a molecular mass of 150 kDa and is composed of a pair of heavy-light protomers, each containing a glycosylated 59-kDa heavy subunit as well as a nonglycosylated 13.5-kDa light subunit(5Klebanoff S.J. Everse J. Everse K. Grisham M. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-36Google Scholar, 6Nauseef W.M. Hematol.

Each molecule of MPO contains two heme groups, associated with the heavy subunit in each pair of heavy-light protomers.Studies of the biosynthesis of MPO by cultured promyelocytic cell lines have demonstrated that MPO is the product of a single gene. The primary translation product undergoes cotranslational N-linked glycosylation to generate a 90-kDa heme-free precursor, apopro-MPO. The heme group is inserted into apopro-MPO to produce the 90-kDa enzymatically active precursor, pro-MPO. Subsequently, pro-MPO undergoes proteolytic maturation, whereby the 125-amino acid pro-sequence is removed, the remaining peptide is cleaved into heavy and light subunits, the heavy-light protomers are paired into the dimeric mature MPO, and the mature protein is targeted to the lysosome (7Johnson K.R.

Pinnix I.B. Raju S.G. Guzman G.S. Kinkade Jr., J.M. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 916-924PubMed Google Scholar).Two peculiar features of MPO biosynthesis prompted these studies. First, the processing of MPO precursor to mature MPO is extremely slow, taking as long as 15 h to chase radiolabel from the precursor into mature protein(8Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Yi H. Blood. 1992; 80: 2622-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the processing and proteolytic maturation of MPO precursor to native MPO is blocked when cells are cultured in the presence of succinyl acetone, an inhibitor of heme synthesis(8Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Yi H. Blood. 1992; 80: 2622-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Castañeda V.L. Parmley R.T. Pinnix I.B. Raju S.G. Guzman G.S. Kinkade Jr., J.M. Exp.

Biophys. 1994; 312: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we reasoned that heme insertion into apopro-MPO may be a rate-limiting step in the relatively slow movement of MPO precursor in the ER to the final cellular destination of mature MPO in the lysosome. Accordingly, we examined whether a molecular chaperone participated in facilitating the critical folding of apopro-MPO to accommodate insertion of heme and subsequent conversion to pro-MPO.We present data demonstrating that calreticulin (CRT), a calcium-binding protein present in the ER of a wide variety of cells (reviewed in (22Denning G.M. Leidal K.G. Holst V. Iyer S. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4 (abstr.): 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), coprecipitated with apopro-MPO, the glycosylated heme-free precursor of MPO. In addition, CRT and apopro-MPO could be selectively and reversibly cross-linked. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that CRT interacted with the MPO precursor early in biosynthesis and that this interaction was transient. Taken together, these data indicate that CRT, like the structurally related ER protein calnexin, can function as a molecular chaperone. These observations expand the identified cellular activities in which CRT participates.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagentsThe human leukemia cell line PLB 985 was acquired from Dr. Timothy Ley (Washington University, St.Louis, MO) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum with 5% Serum-plus (JRF Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). Cells were free of mycoplasma infection. Tissue culture medium was obtained from the University of Iowa Cancer Center. For biosynthetic labeling, RPMI Select Amine kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to prepare methionine-free medium, which was supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 1 mM glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. [35S]Methionine (1, 320 Ci/mmol) and δ-[14C]aminolevulinic acid (48.2 mCi/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Corp. and DuPont NEN, respectively. 3,3′-Dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl proprionate) (DTSSP) was obtained from Pierce. Rat monoclonal antibodies against hsp90 and GRP94 were obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, BC, Canada). Anti-hsp 90 antibody (clone 9D2) was raised against human hsp90 and identifies both free and complexed hsp90. Anti-GRP94 antibody (clone 9G10) recognizes GRP94 from chicken, rodents, and various mammalian cells. Protein A was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and radiolabeled with 125I at a core facility at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Iowa City, IA). Additional chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma.Biosynthetic LabelingPLB 985 cells were grown at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in the medium described above. For biosynthetic labeling, cells were suspended at 5.0 × 105/ml in methionine-free RPMI with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 60 min. After methionine depletion, 25 mCi/ml [35S]methionine was added, and the cells were cultured for the specified time interval. At the end of the labeling period, cells were collected by centrifugation for subsequent analysis as previously described(9Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1986; 67: 865-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, 2.0 × 106 cells were solubilized in 450 μl of lysis buffer, and 150 μl of the solubilized cell lysate (approximately 6.7 × 105 cell equivalents) were used in a given immunoprecipitation. In the case of pulse-chase experiments, cells were resuspended in medium made 1 mM with cold methionine and chased for the specified time interval. In experiments using tunicamycin (TM), cells were suspended in medium containing a specific concentration of TM for 4 h prior to radiolabeling. Longer periods of exposure to TM result in differentiation of promyelocytic cells and concomitant cessation of MPO gene expression(7Johnson K.R. Nauseef W.M. Everse J. Everse K. Grisham M. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 63-82Google Scholar). In experiments using succinyl acetone, cells were maintained in 250 mM succinyl acetone for 72 h prior to biosynthetic labeling. When cells were grown under these conditions, cell viability was normal, but peroxidase activity was reduced to 27.8 ± 1.8% of the control value (n = 11). The activity of lysosomal enzymes elastase and β-glucuronidase were unchanged in succinyl acetone(8Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Yi H. Blood. 1992; 80: 2622-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).ImmunoprecipitationImmunoprecipitations were done under either denaturing or nondenaturing conditions. For both conditions, 100 μl of lysed cells or 700 μl of culture supernatant were used for immunoprecipitations as previously described(9Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1986; 67: 865-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with nonimmune serum for 30 min at 4°C, followed by a 10% suspension of washed formalin-fixed, heat-killed, protein A-containing Staphylococcus aureus (Immunoprecipitin, Life Technologies, Inc.) to clear the sample of radiolabeled proteins, which might nonspecifically associate with the immunoprecipitates. The cleared sample was subsequently incubated with primary antiserum. CRT was immunoprecipitated using a monospecific rabbit antibody raised against purified recombinant human myeloid CRT expressed in baculovirus (22Denning G.M. Leidal K.G. Holst V. Iyer S. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4 (abstr.): 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). MPO-related peptides were recovered using a previously described monospecific rabbit polyclonal antibody to human MPO(23Nauseef W.M. Root R.K. Malech H.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of hsp90 and GRP94, the specific rat monoclonal antibody was used as the primary antibody, followed by rabbit anti-rat IgG antibody as the second antibody. The antigen-antibody complexes were recovered with protein A-bearing S. aureus, and the pellets were washed serially with 1 ml each of 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, with 150 mM NaCl), 2 mM urea in 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS, and TBS. After the final wash, the antigen-antibody complex was released from protein A by heating at 100°C for 5 min in the presence of SDS sample buffer (62 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 2.3% SDS, pH 6.9).When immunoprecipitations were done under denaturing conditions, the cleared lysate was denatured by making the sample 2% SDS and heating to 100°C for 2 min. Prior to the addition of the primary antibody, the SDS concentration of the sample was reduced to 0.2% by the addition of dilution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 190 mM NaCl, 6 mM EDTA, and 2.5% Triton X-100) and cooled on ice. In contrast, immunoprecipitations done under nondenaturing conditions omitted the addition of SDS and heating and proceeded directly with addition of the primary antibody to the cleared sample, as described above.Sequential immunoprecipitations were performed in two steps. First, cells were lysed after a specific period of biosynthetic radiolabeling, treated with DTSSP, and immunoprecipitated with antiserum to CRT, as described above. The CRT immunoprecipitates were heated at 100°C in the presence of 2% SDS and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt the internal disulfide bond in the DTSSP and thereby dissociate the cross-linked proteins. The samples were cooled and diluted with TBS for a final concentration of 0.3% SDS and 1.6 mM DTT. The samples were then immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions using antibodies against CRT, hsp90, GRP94, and MPO, respectively.Cross-linkingProteins were cross-linked with DTSSP according to the manufacturer's instructions. PLB 985 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 100 μg/ml DTSSP with 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride in phosphate-buffered saline. After standing for 30 min at room temperature, the cross-linking reaction was terminated by the addition of Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) (to make the final concentration 50 mM) and by incubation on ice for 5 min. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. Except where noted, the cross-linked proteins were dissociated prior to separation in polyacrylamide gels.Analysis of Immunoprecipitated ProteinsImmunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Except where noted, all samples were reduced prior to SDS-PAGE. When two-dimensional gel analysis was performed, the immunoprecipitate was soaked in lysis buffer and then electrophoresed into tube gels according to the method of O'Farrell(24O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Analysis in the first dimension was performed by electrophoresis toward the anode (isoelectric focusing, IEF) and toward the cathode (non-equilibrium pH gel electrophoresis) (NEPHGE). The IEF or NEPHGE tube gel was soaked in SDS sample buffer containing bromphenol blue and subsequently electrophoresed into a standard SDS slab gel, as previously done(23Nauseef W.M. Root R.K.

The resultant slab gels were fixed, soaked in 1 mM sodium salicylate(26Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar), dried, and subjected to autoradiography. In some cases, the relative amounts of radioactivity in the gels of immunoprecipitated proteins were quantitated on a Phosphorimager SF (Molecular Dynamics).RESULTSTo determine if CRT functioned as a molecular chaperone, we sought proteins that coprecipitated with CRT at various times during its biosynthesis. Experiments using PLB 985 cells or HL 60 cells gave identical results (data not shown), indicating the observed phenomena were not peculiar to PLB 985 cells but were representative of cultured human promyelocytic cells. PLB 985 cells synthesize CRT, which migrates as a single 60-kDa protein after SDS-PAGE(22Denning G.M. Leidal K.G. Holst V. Iyer S. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4 (abstr.): 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because the interactions between nascent proteins and their associated molecular chaperone are noncovalent and transient(27Hartl F.-U. Hlodan R. Langer T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), they are easily disrupted. For that reason immunoprecipitations performed under both highly stringent, denaturing conditions and less stringent, nondenaturing conditions were compared. PLB 985 cells were pulse labeled for 2 h, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with monospecific antiserum against CRT (Fig. 1A). Under denaturing conditions, the 60-kDa CRT was the predominant protein immunoprecipitated. A small amount of a 90-kDa protein, seen as a faint band after autoradiography, was coprecipitated even under these stringent conditions. However, when immunoprecipitation was performed under nondenaturing conditions, both CRT and a significant amount of the 90-kDa protein were immunoprecipitated.Association of CRT and the 90-kDa protein was also directly demonstrated by the use of a reversible chemical cross-linker. Such cross-linking of associated proteins allows immunoprecipitations to be done under denaturing conditions, and the cross-linking can be easily reversed by incubating the immunoprecipitates with reducing agent prior to SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled cells were lysed, treated with the water-soluble homobifunctional cross-linker DTSSP, and immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions with antiserum to CRT. Cross-linked proteins migrated as high molecular weight complexes (160-205 kDa) when the CRT immunoprecipitate was electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1B). In contrast, when the identical immunoprecipitate was reduced prior to SDS-PAGE, the high molecular weight species disappeared, leaving only CRT and the associated 90-kDa protein (Fig. 1B).Undifferentiated PLB 985 cells are very active biosynthetically and make a number of proteins that migrate in the region of 90 kDa, including hsp90, GRP94, and the glycosylated precursors of MPO, apopro-MPO, and pro-MPO. To determine the identity of the 90-kDa protein, we performed sequential immunoprecipitations using antiserum to CRT in the first immunoprecipitation followed by antibodies to hsp90, GRP94, and MPO in the second immunoprecipitation. PLB 985 cells were labeled, lysed, treated with DTSSP, and immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions with antiserum to CRT. When the immunoprecipitate was separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (-DTT), most of the cross-linked proteins remained associated with CRT, resulting in high molecular mass proteins migrating between 160 and 205 kDa (Fig. 2A). In addition to the high molecular weight complex, free CRT and an 85-kDa protein were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The internal disulfide bond in DTSSP was disrupted to disassociate the complex, and the samples immunoprecipitated with antibodies to CRT, hsp90, GRP94, or MPO (Fig. 2A). As an internal control, the antibody to CRT successfully precipitated CRT when used as the second antibody. Neither the antibody to hsp90 nor that to GRP94 precipitated a radiolabeled protein when used as the second antibody in the sequential immunoprecipitation. In contrast, the MPO antibody precipitated a 90-kDa protein from the sequential immunoprecipitation when used as the second antibody and separated in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. All three antibodies immunoprecipitated their target proteins from radiolabeled cells when used as the first antibody in the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that the failure to precipitate hsp90 and GRP94 in the sequential immunoprecipitation reflected the absence of these proteins from the first immunoprecipitation, using CRT antiserum, rather than the inability of the cells to synthesize the proteins or of the antibodies to immunoprecipitate. MPO contains internal disulfide bonds(28Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and the precursor migrates as a 90-kDa protein under reducing conditions but as an 85-kDa protein under nonreducing conditions. 2W. M. Nauseef, unpublished data. The presence of a small amount of the 85-kDa protein in the nonreduced cross-linked sample (Fig. 2A) indicates that some of the coprecipitated MPO precursor was not cross-linked under these conditions. These data demonstrate that antiserum to CRT selectively immunoprecipitated the 90-kDa precursor of MPO.Figure 2:CRT coprecipitated with the 90-kDa precursor of myeloperoxidase. A, cells were labeled as described in Fig. 1, lysed, cross-linked with DTSSP, and immunoprecipitated with antiserum to CRT. The cross-linked proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (-DTT). In the sequential immunoprecipitations, the cross-linking was disrupted, and the samples were immunoprecipitated with the second antibody directed against CRT, hsp90, GRP94, or MPO. The nonreduced samples contained the high molecular mass protein complexes (160-205 kDa), free CRT, and a protein of 85 kDa. The only antisera precipitating proteins in the second immunoprecipitation were those for CRT and for MPO. Internal disulfide bonds in the MPO precursor caused it to migrate differently under reducing (90 kDa) and nonreducing (85 kDa) conditions. B, under the labeling conditions used, PLB 985 cells synthesize numerous proteins (Total), including hsp90, GRP94, and MPO, each of which was immunoprecipitated from labeled cells by the corresponding specific antisera. The cross-linked proteins precipitated by CRT antiserum were dissociated and subjected to two-dimensional analysis. C, the immunoprecipitate was analyzed both by IEF and by NEPHGE in the first dimension, followed by SDS-PAGE. Whereas CRT migrated into the IEF gel in the first dimension, the 90-kDa protein migrated as a single protein into the NEPHGE gel, indicating it was highly cationic. The behavior of this protein under these conditions was identical to that of the MPO precursor (lowerpanel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that the 90-kDa protein coprecipitated with CRT was related to MPO and that no additional 90-kDa proteins were coprecipitated, the cross-linked proteins precipitated by the CRT antiserum were reduced, to dissociate the linked proteins, and then subjected to analysis in two-dimensional gels (Fig. 2C). The precipitated proteins were separated in the first dimension by IEF or by NEPHGE, and the resultant gel was subjected to SDS-PAGE. In the first dimension analysis, all of the 90-kDa protein coprecipitated with CRT migrated under NEPHGE conditions, indicating its strongly cationic character. The behavior of this protein under these conditions was identical to that of the 90-kDa precursor of MPO (Fig. 2C, lowerpanel). In contrast, CRT migrated into the IEF gel, as expected given its isoelectric point. No 90-kDa protein was detected after IEF × SDS-PAGE.When biosynthetically labeled PLB 985 cells were immunoprecipitated with MPO antiserum under nondenaturing conditions, no radiolabeled proteins unrelated to MPO were immunoprecipitated. CRT has a very long half-life, in excess of 50 h(22Denning G.M. Leidal K.G. Holst V. Iyer S. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4 (abstr.): 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and one would anticipate that this pool of preexistent CRT would result in CRT of low specific activity after biosynthetic labeling. When unlabeled cells were immunoprecipitated with MPO antiserum and the electroblotted immunoprecipitates were probed with CRT antiserum, approximately 10% of the total cellular CRT was detectable in the immunoprecipitate (data not shown). These findings are essentially the same as those for calnexin and its associated proteins(29Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M.

In many instances, conditions that produce misfolded proteins increase the expression of molecular chaperones(33Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.

In contrast to its effect on GRP94 synthesis, 3W. M. Nauseef and S. J. McCormick, unpublished data. TM did not increase the rate of CRT biosynthesis (Fig. 3A). In addition, antiserum to CRT failed to coprecipitate any 90-kDa protein from cells grown in the presence of TM (Fig. 3A, lanes1 and 2). The failure of the 90-kDa protein to coprecipitate with CRT suggests that TM inhibited either the production of the 90-kDa protein or its association with CRT. As previously shown(7Johnson K.R. Nauseef W.M. Everse J. Everse K. Grisham M. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 63-82Google Scholar), TM-treated PLB 985 cells synthesize the 80-kDa nonglycosylated form of the MPO precursor (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2019403369,"Mastoparan facilitates opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore through an apparent bimodal mechanism of action. In the submicromolar concentration range, the action of mastoparan is dependent upon the medium Ca2+ and phosphate concentration and is subject to inhibition by cyclosporin A. At concentrations above 1 μM, pore induction by mastoparan occurs without an apparent Ca2+ requirement and in a cyclosporin A insensitive manner. Studies utilizing phospholipid vesicles show that mastoparan perturbs bilayer membranes across both concentration ranges, through a mechanism which is strongly dependent upon transmembrane potential. However, solute size exclusion studies suggest that the pores formed in mitochondria in response to both low and high concentrations of mastoparan are the permeability transition pore. It is proposed that low concentrations of mastoparan influence the pore per se, with higher concentrations having the additional effect of depolarizing the mitochondrial inner membrane through an action exerted upon the lipid phase. It may be the combination of these effects which allow pore opening in the absence of Ca2+ and in the presence of cyclosporin A, although other interpretations remain viable. A comparison of the activities of mastoparan and its analog, MP14, on mitochondria and phospholipid vesicles provides an initial indication that a G-protein may participate in regulation of the permeability transition pore. These studies draw attention to peptides, in a broad sense, as potential pore regulators in cells, under both physiological and pathological conditions."

We were interested in knowing whether TFIIE is also involved in recruiting TFIIH to the excision repair complex. We found that cell-free extract depleted of TFIIE carried out excision repair at a normal rate, leading us to conclude that TFIIE is not involved in recruiting TFIIH to the damage site and has no role in general excision repair.

The carboxyl-terminal half of XPA is responsible for specific interaction with TFIIH.

Recent studies have shown that cells can secrete carboxyl terminus truncated APP derivatives (APP-S) in response to physiological stimulus. We have used human central nervous system neurons (NT2N) derived from a teratocarcinoma cell line (NT2) to study the signal transduction pathways involved in APP-S secretion and Aβ production. Muscarinic receptors (m2 and m3) as well as the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Gq and the β1 isoform of phospholipase C were present in NT2N neurons. Stimulation of the muscarinic receptor with carbachol resulted in phospholipase C activation as shown by a transient increase in the second messengers 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Carbachol also caused an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels measured in single NT2N neurons. Under these conditions, carbachol caused a time-dependent 2-fold increase in APP-S secretion into the medium. In contrast, prolonged treatment with carbachol caused a decrease in Aβ production into the medium. These results suggest that APP-S secretion and Aβ production in NT2N neurons are regulated by the muscarinic/phospholipase C signal transduction pathway.

This neurodegenerative disease is associated with neuron loss and death which affect many neuronal populations. In particular, the cholinergic cells which arise in the basal forebrain and terminate in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex are severely affected(1Yankner B.A. Mesulam M.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 1849-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The selective vulnerability of cholinergic neurons has been the focus of intensive studies to elucidate its biochemical mechanism(4Greenamyre J.T. Maragos W.F. Cerebrovasc. Brain Metab.

The Aβ peptide is derived from amyloid precursor proteins (APP). APP is an integral membrane, tyrosine-sulfated glycoprotein with one membrane-spanning domain and an extracytoplasmic NH2 terminus. APP exists in three major isoforms in the central nervous system, which are encoded by the same gene on chromosome 21. Alternative mRNA splicing generates 695- (APP695), 751- (APP751), and 770-amino acid APP (APP770). The brain is the richest source of APP, and in particular APP695 is restricted almost exclusively to the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system(10Arai H. Lee V.M.-Y. Messinger M.L.

In recent years, there has been an intense effort to elucidate the pathways whereby Aβ is generated from APP. Aβ peptide is a 39-43 amino acid internal sequence that extends from within the transmembrane domain into the extracytoplasmic domain of APP. There are several pathways to process APP. In the constitutive secretory pathway (or α-secretase), APP is cleaved, within the Aβ sequence at residue 687 just outside the transmembrane domain, by the action of a protease, to a large secreted NH2-terminal derivative (APP-S) and a membrane-associated fragment, neither of which can produce β-amyloid protein(12Sisodia S.S.

McClure D. Ward P.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1122-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). The presence of a β-secretase has also been inferred which cleaves APP precisely at the amino terminus of Aβ (14Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Lieberburg I. Schenk D.B. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In a third processing pathway, APP is processed in the endosomal and lysosomal system, and yields complex COOH-terminal derivatives, some of which are potentially amyloidogenic(15Golde T.E. Estus S.

More recently, several groups have shown that APP processing in the endosomal/lysosomal system produces a 4-kDa β-amyloid protein that is essentially similar to the deposited amyloid of Alzheimer's disease (reviewed in Refs. 17, 18). It has recently been recognized that Aβ is present in human cerebrospinal fluid from normal and Alzheimer's disease patients and that cultures of neuronal and non-neuronal cells transfected with the APP gene secrete Aβ into the medium(19Shoji M.

Importantly, a unique human neuronal cell line NT2N has been shown to secrete endogenous Aβ into the culture medium(11Wertkin A.M. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trojanowski J.Q.

Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that normal human neurons can generate the Aβ peptide. The pathways involved in APP processing under non-amyloidogenic conditions have begun to be studied. Using human embryonic kidney cell lines transfected with the genes for the human brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, Nitsch et al. have shown that stimulation of the m1 and m3 receptor subtypes with carbachol increases the release of APP derivatives(22Nitsch R.M.

Citron M. Wurtman R.J. Growdon J.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22959-22962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human neurons express mainly the APP695 isoform(11Wertkin A.M. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition to astrocytes, microglia, and vascular cells, neurons are a likely source of Aβ deposited in amyloid in Alzheimer's disease: it is therefore important to study APP expression, processing, and regulation in neurons. Furthermore, since Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative diseases only occurs in humans and primates (17Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 28Price D.L. Martin L.J. Sisodia S.S. Wagster M.V. Koo E.H. Walker L.C. Koliatsos V.E. Cork L.C. Brain Pathol. 1991; 1: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and there is no rodent animal model which recapitulates the development of this disease, these studies should ideally be performed in human neurons. Postmitotic mature human neurons, however, are difficult to isolate and maintain in culture. Because of these limitations we have used a unique culture model of human neurons, the NT2N neuronal cells. NT2N neurons are derived from a human teratocarcinoma cell line, Ntera 2/c1.D1 (NT2), that is induced by treatment with retinoic acid to commit irreversibly to a neuronal phenotype(29Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Prior extensive studies have shown that NT2N neurons express many cytoskeletal markers, cell-surface antigens, and synaptic proteins typical of central nervous system neurons(29Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are permanently postmitotic and develop functional dendrites and axons. They can be purified to yield >99% pure postmitotic human neurons. The rationale for using NT2N cells to study the regulation of APP-S secretion is that 1) different cells process APP differently, 2) unlike non-neuronal cells, NT2N neurons express predominantly APP695, the major APP isoform expressed in neurons in brain, 3) in NT2N cells, APP695 can be easily detected without transfection of the APP gene, and 4) NT2N neurons constitutively generate intracellular Aβ peptide and release it into the culture medium(11Wertkin A.M. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, NT2N neurons represent a unique and physiological human model system to study APP processing and Aβ production which closely recapitulates events in the normal human brain. In the present study, we have used NT2N neurons to study muscarinic regulation of APP secretion and Aβ production and to dissect the signal transduction pathways involved. The human teratocarcinoma NTera2/c1.D1 (NT2) cells were maintained in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. NT2N cells (>99% pure, i.e. replate no. 3 cells) were generated as described previously(29Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 106/75-cm2 flask) were treated with 10 μM retinoic acid twice a week for 5 weeks. Cells were then replated (Replate no. 1). Two days later, cells were mechanically dislodged, replated in culture flasks (replate no. 2), and cultured for an additional 6-8 days, after which the neuronal cells were again dislodged with trypsin, and replated on Matrigel (Collaborative Research)/poly-D-lysine coated coverslips or dishes (replate no. 3). Cells were generally used within 4 weeks after replate no. 3. NT2N neurons were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid (31Wolf B.A. Easom R.A. McDaniel M.L. Turk J. J. Clin.

Each dish was then gently washed five times in a modified Krebs-HEPES buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.40), 115 mM NaCl, 24 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 3 mMD-glucose), preincubated 30 min under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37°C, and then incubated for 0-30 min with fresh Krebs-HEPES buffer ± 1 mM carbachol. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were quenched with ice-cold methanol. Prior to extraction, carrier amounts (5 μg) of phosphatidylcholine, monoolein, diolein, and arachidonic acid were added to each tube to aid in recovery, followed by 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of water. Tubes were vortexed (1 min), sonicated (30 min, 4°C), and vortexed (1 min). Tubes were centrifuged in a refrigerated table-top centrifuge (15 min, 4°C, 800 × g). The lower organic phase was transferred with a silanized Pasteur pipette to a clean silanized 13 × 100-mm conical borosilicate tube. The remaining aqueous upper phase was re-extracted twice with chloroform (1 ml) and the extracts combined with the previous organic phase. The organic phase was washed twice with water (3 ml), concentrated twice under Nitrogen in a TurboVap evaporator (Zymark, Hopkinton, MA), and reconstituted in 25 μl of chloroform. With this extraction procedure, recovery of [3H]arachidonic acid was >95%(33Konrad R.J. Jolly Y.C. Major C. Wolf B.A. Biochem.

Samples were spotted onto the preadsorbent zone of channeled Silica Gel G TLC 20 × 20-cm plates (Analtech, Newark, DE) which had been activated 30 min at 110°C. Plates were developed for 30-45 min in petroleum ether (30-60°C)/diethyl ether/acetic acid (140:60:2, v/v/v)(36Wolf B.A. Turk J. Sherman W.R. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol.

The radioactivity of the chromatogram was quantitated with a Berthold Linear Analyzer 284 (Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) equipped with a position-sensitive proportional high resolution counter tube (200 mm long, 1380 V) continuously flushed (0.5 liter/min) with P10 gas (90% argon, 10% methane) and a 4-mm entrance window. Each TLC lane was scanned simultaneously in its entirety (20 cm) for 60 min. The instrument detected radioactive peaks as small as 50-100 disintegrations/min (area under the curve) with a resolution of 0.5 mm. Data analysis was performed using version 7.19 of the Berthold 1D-TLC software. Radioactive peaks corresponding to diacylglycerol and phospholipids were integrated. Peak identity was assigned by comparison with iodine-stained cold standards and radiolabeled commercial [3H]arachidonic acid. Typically, the following Rf were obtained: phospholipids (0), monoacylglycerol (0.19), diacylglycerol (0.45), arachidonic acid (0.63), triacylglycerol (0.88). Radioactivity in the diacylglycerol peak was normalized to the total radioactivity incorporated into the phospholipid fraction(31Wolf B.A. Easom R.A. McDaniel M.L. Turk J. J. Clin.

[3H]Inositol-labeled neurons were washed, preincubated, and incubated with agonists as described above. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed, and 0.5 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid was added to each dish. Cells were scraped, transferred to a dry-ice/ethanol bath (15 min), vortexed (1 min), sonicated (30 min), vortexed (1 min), and centrifuged (2,000 × g, 15 min, +4°C)(37Wolf B.A. Hughes J.H.

The supernatant was extracted with diethyl ether (5 × 3 ml), adjusted to pH 7.0 and lyophilized, and reconstituted in 350 μl of 1 mM EDTA pH 7.0 (supplemented with 10 μg of AMP, 38 μg of ADP, 50 μg of ATP) prior to strong anion-exchange (SAX) HPLC analysis. The HPLC system consisted of a Varian 9095 injector, Varian 9010 pump, Varian 9050 detector, Whatman Partisil 10 SAX cartridge, Partisil SAX guard column, and a Whatman Solvecon precolumn. The solvent program (1 ml/min) was: gradient from 0 to 2 min of 20% solvent B (2.5 M NaH2PO4, pH 3.8 with NaOH), 20% B at 18 min, 28% B at 20 min, 28% B at 28 min, 100% B at 30 min and maintained for 10 min, 100% solvent A (H2O) at 42 min and maintained for 8 min. One-ml fractions were collected every minute and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer following the addition of 4 ml of In-Flow BD scintillation mixture (In-US Systems Inc, Fairfield, NJ). Peak identity was assigned by comparison with commercial radiolabeled standards and concomitant UV monitoring of AMP, ADP, and ATP(38Wolf B.A. Florholmen J. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol.

Muscarinic receptor subtypes were identified by immunoprecipitation of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate-labeled receptors expressed by NT2N neurons using specific antibodies and receptor density calculated as described previously(40Li M.

NT2N neurons were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated round glass coverslips and bathed in Hanks' buffer containing 2.6 mM Ca2+. Neurons were loaded with 5 μM fura 2AM for 45 min before use, and then mounted in a temperature-controlled dish on the stage of a NIKON Diaphot inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Cytosolic free Ca2+ in a single neuron was calculated from the ratio of fura 2 fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm as previously published(44Hansen C.A. Yang L. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18573-18579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NT2N cells were metabolically labeled (30 min for APP-S secretion in modified Krebs-HEPES medium, 3 h for Aβ production in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml), washed, and then stimulated with carbachol (1 mM) as described above. Following stimulation with carbachol (15-90 min for APP-S secretion, 1-8 h for Aβ production), the supernatant was removed and processed for immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-APP-S antibody (KAREN, anti-NH2-terminal APP, a kind gift of Dr. Barry Greenberg) or with monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody (4G8, Institute for Basic Research, Staten Island, NY) as described previously(11Wertkin A.M.

In brief, the conditioned medium from the neurons was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g, and proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with equal amounts of saturated ammonium sulfate at +4°C overnight. After a high speed spin, the pellet was resuspended in 1 × RIPA (11Wertkin A.M. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunoprecipitates were then separated on SDS/7.5% PAGE or 16.5% Tris/Tricine gels, and radioactivity in the APP-S 90-kDa protein or 4-kDa Aβ peptide band was calculated after exposure of the gel to a PhosphorImager plate (Molecular Dynamics) and analysis with the ImageQuant software. Within each experiment, results were normalized to the condition with the highest amount of radioactivity (90 min with carbachol for APP-S, 8 h control for Aβ) and are expressed as a ratio to that condition. Detection of phospholipase C isoforms and GTP-binding protein subtypes was performed using standard Western blotting techniques. In brief, NT2N neurons were homogenized in Laemmli's buffer. SDS-PAGE (7.5-15% polyacrylamide depending on the protein of interest) was performed on a Bio-Rad mini-PROTEAN II gel apparatus using standard techniques and rainbow molecular weight markers. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with the appropriate antibody. Detection of the antibody-labeled protein was typically performed with 125I-protein A or rabbit anti-mouse IgG followed by 125I-protein A (for monoclonal antibodies). Detection and quantitation of the bands of interest were performed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Phospholipase C monoclonal antibodies directed to the β1, γ1, γ2, and δ isoforms were obtained commercially (UBI, Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies to the GTP-binding protein subunits were generated as described previously(45Brass L.F. Hoxie J.A. Manning D.R. Thromb.

Selected antibodies used in this study include antibody 1190 which recognizes αs, 0116 against all αis, 1521 against αi2, 3646 against αi1, 3642 against αi3, 2921 against αz, 9072 against αo1 and αo2, 0121 against α12, 0120 against α13, 946 against αq #0130 against α16, and 5357 against βγ. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using version 5.0 of SSPS for Windows (SSPS Inc., Chicago, IL) or SigmaStat for Windows (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). Data were analyzed by one-way or two-way analysis of variance followed by multiple comparisons between means using the Least Significant Difference test or the Student-Newman-Keuls method. A probability of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. NT2N cells are pure, postmitotic, differentiated human neurons. They represent a unique model of human neurons in culture with functional dendrites and axons. As shown in Fig. 1, they also express muscarinic receptors. The most abundant subtype in NT2N neurons was m3 (0.113 ± 0.032 pmol/mg protein) which is known to be coupled to the phospholipase C signal transduction pathway, followed by the m2 subtype (0.072 ± 0.016 pmol/mg protein). Two major isoforms of phospholipase C were detected by immunoblotting in NT2N neurons: β1 and γ1 (Fig. 2A). No significant amounts of the γ2 and δ isoforms were observed. As expected, phospholipase C activity was detected enzymatically in NT2N cell homogenate using [3H]phosphatidylinositol as a substrate (data not shown) (50Rhee S.G. Ryu S.H. Lee K.Y. Cho K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 502-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since it has been shown in other cell types that the muscarinic receptor m3 is coupled to the β1 isoform of phospholipase C via Gαq, a GTP-binding protein, we used a panel of monoclonal antibodies to α-subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins to identify their presence in NT2N neurons. As shown in Fig. 2B, αq- and βγ-subunits were identified as well as αo and α13, but not any of the other α-subunits tested for (αi, αz, α12, and α16). Thus, these results indicate that all the components of the muscarinic/phospholipase C signal transduction pathway are present in NT2N neurons. In order to assess phospholipase C activation, NT2N neurons were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid for 24 h, washed in a modified Krebs-HEPES buffer, preincubated for 30 min at 37°C, and then stimulated for 0-30 min with carbachol (1 mM). Neutral lipids including DAG were extracted and purified by 1D-TLC, and quantitated with a sensitive linear analyzer. Fig. 3 shows a typical radiochromatogram from these"

We now characterize the DNA and protein requirements for the interaction of hnRNP K with the CT element. First, hnRNP K is shown to preferentially bind single-stranded DNA over RNA or native double-stranded DNA. Using specific oligoribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide probes with specific or nonspecific RNA or DNA competitors, electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed hnRNP K to be a DNA-binding protein. Specific binding was not simply a reflection of binding to pyrimidine-rich sequences as the number and arrangement of individual CT elements governed interactions with hnRNP K; at least two CT repeats separated by at least three nucleotides are required for binding, indicating the existence of particular stereochemical constraints regulating CT-hnRNP K complex formation. Deletion analysis showed that hnRNP K possesses several nonoverlapping, DNA binding domains, each capable of specific binding with the CT element and preferring DNA over RNA. Each sequence recognition domain is composed of at least one K homology motif, while a larger portion of hnRNP K may be required for stable RNA binding. Additional experiments indicate that the N-terminal 35 residues of hnRNP K are necessary for transactivating the CT element.

However, several recent reports suggest that this same protein is a DNA-binding protein.

A recent report demonstrated that the integrity of all KH domains in hnRNP K is required for RNA binding and that the RNA binding activity of the FMR1 protein from a severely retarded fragile X patient is impaired by a single point mutation in one of the KH domains.

On the other hand, the domains of hnRNP K that mediate sequence-specific DNA recognition have not been determined, although involvement of KH domains might be predicted.

Is hnRNP K a bifunctional DNA- and RNA-binding protein? Partitioning of protein between DNA and RNA is a regulatory device exploited in prokaryotes and also reported in vertebrates; for example, Xenopus laevis transcription factor TFIIIA binds to both the 5 S rRNA gene and to 5 S RNA(14Honda B.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1980; 22: 119-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Pelham H.R.B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4170-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The interaction of dual specificity proteins, including hnRNP K with DNA and RNA in a sequence-specific or nonspecific manner, must be governed by the relative binding affinity and concentration of target binding sites. To determine the extent to which hnRNP K might interact with DNA, the binding affinity of hnRNP K with DNA and RNA was compared. Surprisingly, single-stranded DNA is the preferred target of hnRNP K. Because hnRNP K can also transactivate the CT element, this protein has all the features of a bona fide transcription factor. The full-length and the deletion mutants of GST-RNP K, N-terminal-KH1+2 (1-265) and C-terminal-KH3 (329-463), were created by PCR of an hnRNP K cDNA (pHK5, a kind gift from G. Dreyfuss) using the following oligonucleotide: TCAGATGAATTCATATGGAAACTGAACAGCCAGAAGAAACCTTC (5′ oligo) and TAAAGCGAATTCTAAGAAAAACTTTCCAGAATACTGCTTCAC (3′ oligo) for the GST-RNP K, 5′ oligo and GATTCACCGGAATTCACGCATTTAGCTAGCTGGTCCTCGACGAGGGCTCATATCATCATA for the N-terminal-KH1+2, and AGATCACCGCCCGGGACGCATTCAGCTAGCGGCGGCCGG-GGTGGTAGCAGAGCTCGGAAT and 3′ oligo for the C-terminal-KH3. PCR products for the GST-RNP K and Nterminal-KH1+2 were restricted with EcoRI, and those for the C-terminal-KH3 were restricted with SmaI and EcoRI, which were cloned into pGEX-2TK. N-terminal region was created by inserting the EcoRl and the BglII fragment of the GST-RNP K into pGEX-2TK. The hnRNP K expression plasmid (full-length hnRNP K) was constructed by inserting the EcoRI fragment encoding hnRNP K from pHK5 into pcDNAI/AMP (Invitrogen), and several mutants were constructed from the hnRNP K expression plasmid by deleting the following fragments from full-length hnRNP K: NKH1+2 (1-367); deletion of the BspEI-XhoI fragment, NKH3 (1-35, 368-463); deletion of the 997-bp BglII-HpaII fragment from position 211 to 1207, N-term (1-35); deletion of the BglII-XbaI fragment. C-term (368-463) was constructed after PCR of the hnRNP K expression plasmid using the following two oligonucleotides: AGCTCGAATTCAGAATATGGACGGATATGATTATTCCTATGCAGGGGG and CTAGATGCATGCTCGAGCGGC. The PCR product was cleaved with EcoRI and was cloned into pcDNAI/Amp. The reporter plasmids Δ56-mut was described in Takimoto et al.(3Takimoto M. Tomonaga T. Matunis M. Avigan M. Krutzsch H. Dreyfuss G. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18249-18258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Δ56CT3 was constructed by inserting the double-stranded CT3 oligonucleotides into HindIII site of Δ56. The sequence of the CT3 is as follows: AATTCTCCTCCCCACCTTCCCCACCCTCCCCA (template strand). GAL4-Nterm was constructed after PCR of 1-35 amino acids of pHK5 using the following two oligonucleotides: CCGGGGATCCGTATGGAAACTGAACAGCCAGAAGAAACC and TTCAACCATCTCATCAGTGTTTCTAGATCTTTT. PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and BglII and was cloned downstream of GAL4 (1-147)(16Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). GAL4-Cterm was created by inserting the HpaII-EcoRV fragment of hnRNP K expression plasmid into the SmaI site downstream of GAL4 (1-147). The reporter plasmid contained adenovirus E1bTATA promoter driven by five GAL4 sites coupled to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene as described elsewhere (17Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein was purified from extracts of E. coli transformed with the pGEX-2TK(18Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar), pGEX-hnRNP K, or plasmids encoding mutant proteins by glutathioneagarose affinity chromatography (Sigma). Fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mM glutathione and checked for purity, correct size, and concentration with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EMSA (19Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) was performed with the indicated amount of recombinant protein incubated in 25 mM Tris, 200 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 2 μg/ml poly[d(I•C)], and labeled probe as indicated. Twenty units of rRNasin (Promega) was used with RNA probe and competitors to avoid degradation. The DNA and RNA probes were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Binding reactions were incubated for 20 min on ice, and protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 4 or 7% acrylamide gel in 50 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, 0.5 mM EDTA buffer at 4°C. CT3 oligonucleotide was described above and riboCT3 is AAUUCUCCUCCCCACCUUCCCCACCCUCCCCA (Clontech). The nonspecific DNA competitor is the noncoding strand of the FUSE (−1500 bp upstream of the c-myc P1 promoter), GATCCTATATTCCCTCGGGATTTTTTATTTTGT, and nonspecific RNA competitor is the corresponding ribooligonucleotide, GAUCCUAUAUUCCCUCGGGAUUUUUUAUUUUGU. CT1 is GATCAAGCCAATTCTCCTCCCCACACAGGAAG, CT2 is AATTCTCCTCCCCACCTTCCCCACACAGGAAG, CT2-3 is AGCTAACCCTCCCCAATGCCCTCCCCATAG, CT2-9 is AGCTAACCCTCCCCAATGCCCTCCCCATAG, and CT2-30 is AGCTAACCCTCCCCAGATCAAGCCTGCGATGATTTATACTCACAGCCCTCCCCATAG. Human DNA used as a competitor was isolated from Hela cells by addition of an equal volume of 10 mM EDTA and 0.2% SDS, treated with RNase and proteinase K, and purified by two phenol extractions, followed by a phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA was isolated from Hela cells with RNAzol™ B (Tel-test) and treated with DNase to eliminate DNA contamination. Hela and COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (5 × 106) were resuspended in 250 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated on ice for 10 min with plasmid DNA. Electroporation was performed with Cell-porator (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 230-V, 1180-μF setting, and after the electroshock, the cells were incubated on ice for an additional 10 min. Transfected cells were added to 10 ml of medium and incubated for 48 h before harvesting for CAT assays(20Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). To determine which nucleic acid hnRNP K binds most tightly, the binding activity of hnRNP K to heat-denatured total human ssDNA, dsDNA, and total cellular RNA was compared. As previously reported, hnRNP K forms a specific complex, detected by EMSA, with the pyrimidine-rich strand of the CT element found upstream of the human c-myc promoter, composed of tandem imperfect repeats of a 9-bp sequence (CT repeat: CCCTCCCCA)(3Takimoto M. Tomonaga T. Matunis M. Avigan M. Krutzsch H. Dreyfuss G. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18249-18258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a pyrimidine strand probe comprised of three CT repeats (CT3) and bacterially expressed GST-hnRNP K, complex formation was challenged with total RNA, ssDNA, or dsDNA (Fig. 1). Whereas 5 μg of ssDNA virtually eliminated formation of the hnRNP K-probe complex formation, the same amount of RNA had little effect, and dsDNA had no effect. This result showed that hnRNP K binds more tightly with ssDNA than to RNA and is virtually oblivious to dsDNA. Although it seemed that hnRNP K preferred ssDNA to RNA, the possibility remained that binding of hnRNP K to the deoxy-CT-element was actually a manifestation of an even stronger sequence preference for a cytidine-rich RNA sequence, vastly underrepresented in total RNA. Therefore the identical sequence, either in RNA (rCT3, three repeats of CCCUCCCCA) or DNA (dCT3, three repeats of CCCTCCCCA), was compared for binding with hnRNP K in the presence of either RNA or DNA competitor (Fig. 2). GST-RNP K was incubated with rCT3 or dCT3 probe and challenged with rCT3 or dCT3 competitor. Under all conditions, dCT3 bound more tightly with hnRNP K than rCT3. The relative ratio of the dissociation constants (Kd) of hnRNP K-dCT3 and hnRNP K-rCT3 complexes, determined from binding curves, revealed 5-fold greater binding of hnRNP K to DNA than to RNA (data not shown). hnRNP K-dCT3 and hnRNP K-rCT3 complexes are both sequence-specific, as vast excesses of irrelevant sequence DNA or RNA did not perturb binding to the CT element. Thus, dCT3 is the preferred ligand of hnRNP K. Previous studies of hnRNP K binding to DNA and RNA have employed polymeric or oligomeric nucleic acids composed entirely or largely of cytidine residues. If hnRNP K recognizes a defined motif comprised principally of cytidine, then it should be able to recognize its cognate sequence even when embedded among irrelevant sequences. Alternatively, if hnRNP K binding requires only cytidine-rich nucleic acid then the composition, and not the arrangement, of the nucleotides comprising the probe should determine the binding affinity. It has already been demonstrated that hnRNP K binds to three direct CT repeats; to determine the minimum number and arrangement of CT elements required for binding with hnRNP K, several defined sequence single-stranded deoxyoligonucleotide probes were synthesized and tested by EMSA (Fig. 3A). hnRNP K did not bind to one (CT1) or two tandem repeats (CT2). However, by separating the two CT elements from each other with an irrelevant spacer sequence, molecules forming specific complexes with hnRNP K were created; the binding affinity of hnRNP K to the probe increased as the distance between the two CT elements was increased from 3 bp (CT2-3) to 9 bp (CT2-9) and to 30 bp (CT2-30) (Fig. 3B). Thus, hnRNP K recognizes single-stranded CT elements, not simply base composition, and to be recognized the elements must be arranged in a polymer capable of adapting to certain stereochemical requirements. In these respects hnRNP K behaves similarly to most sequence specific DNA-binding proteins. To determine what portions of hnRNP K directed specific binding to dCT3 or rCT3, a series of deletion mutants were expressed as GST fusion proteins and assayed by EMSA (Fig. 4, A and B). Surprisingly, nonoverlapping segments of hnRNP K formed complexes with dCT3 and only the solitary N terminus lacking any KH domain failed to bind to dCT3. The binding observed was specific because complex formation could be competed by CT elements but not by unrelated sequences (Fig. 4C). Therefore, redundant sequence recognition domains reside within the hnRNP K backbone, perhaps reflecting the reiterated nature of the CT element as it occurs in the human c-myc gene. In contrast to these observations, Siomi et al.(11Siomi H. Choi M. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1994; 77: 33-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), using an entirely different assay, concluded that most of hnRNP K was required to bind nucleic acid, including all three KH domains. Nevertheless, inspection of their data suggested that deletions involving KH domain 1 were relatively more impaired for binding to poly(rC) than with oligo(dC). Conversely, deletions involving KH domain 3 were more impaired for oligo(dC) binding. Consistent with this observation, in Fig. 4C, it is apparent that C-terminal-KH3 possesses an enhanced ability to discriminate dCT3 over rCT3. Furthermore, other workers have reported that the C-terminal 75 amino acid residues of hnRNP K, including KH domain 3, are sufficient to bind ssDNA(21Ito K. Sato K. Endo H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The differences in these observations may be explained by different assays, employing different nucleic acid targets, and varying in the number and arrangement of their specific cognate sequences such that all three KH domains are not always required for complex formation. The contributions of different portions of hnRNP K to recognition of DNA over RNA were not equivalent. Comparing the relative ratio of the Kd values for ssDNA and RNA, the C-terminal-KH3 protein prefers DNA to RNA by 30-fold and the N-terminal-KH1+2 protein by only 10-fold. Because full-length hnRNP K bound DNA 5-fold more than RNA, a larger portion of hnRNP K may be necessary to stabilize RNA binding. If hnRNP K recognizes the CT element to stimulate expression, then the same domains that separately bind to dCT3 in vitro might independently facilitate CT element activity in vivo. Therefore, a series of hnRNP K deletion mutants, characterized for binding in vitro were cloned downstream of the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer/promoter (Fig. 5A) and were cotransfected with the CT3-minimal fos promoter CAT (Δ56CT3) or mutant CT elements-minimal fos promoter CAT (Δ56CT-mut) reporter plasmids (Fig. 5B). Full-length hnRNP K augmented CT-mediated expression approximately 4-fold. The mutant forms of hnRNP K possessing KH domain 1+2 (NKH1+2) or 3 (NKH3), which retained specific dCT3 binding by EMSA, also mediated CT element activation in vivo. In contrast, the N-terminal region alone, which does not have a KH domain (N-term), had only a marginal effect, indicating that at least one KH domain is required for transactivation. The only mutant that bound in vitro, but failed to transactivate the CT element, was composed solely of C-terminal sequences (KH3) and lacked the N-terminal residues shared by all other constructs. These results, when combined with the in vitro binding data, suggest that at least one KH domain is required for the DNA binding and the N-terminal region is likely to be required for transactivation. It is important to note that transactivation is sequence specific because none of the mutants stimulated the reporter gene containing a mutant CT element. To test the hypothesis that the N terminus is necessary for transactivation, the first 35 amino acids from the N terminus of hnRNP K, including 11 acidic residues, were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, GAL4 (1-147). The resulting plasmid was cotransfected along with the CAT gene driven by five GAL4 sites from the adenovirus E1bTATA into COS7 cells (Fig. 6). As predicted, the N terminus of hnRNP K (GAL4-Nterm) increased CAT activity compared to the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone. Although the C-terminal region (KH3) of hnRNP K is required to stimulate the CT element, the GAL4 C-terminal fusion protein did not augment expression from GAL4 sites, consistent with the notion that KH3 supplies a nucleic acid recognition motif but not a transactivation domain. Thus, the first 35 amino acid residues of hnRNP K are important for transactivation. hnRNP K was first identified as a component of RNP complexes of hnRNA in mammalian cells(1Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 2Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It possesses a highly conserved motif, the KH domain, which is present in several other proteins(22Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). The KH domain is commonly considered an RNA binding domain despite the demonstration that at least three mammalian KH proteins (hnRNP K, p62, and FMR) have been shown to bind with either DNA or RNA(3Takimoto M. Tomonaga T. Matunis M. Avigan M. Krutzsch H. Dreyfuss G. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18249-18258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ashley Jr., C.T. Wilkinson K.D. Reines D. Warren S.T. Science. 1993; 262: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 12Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Cell. 1992; 69: 551-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). DNA versus RNA binding has not been previously compared for these proteins; if DNA binding is merely a vestige of RNA binding, then their affinity for RNA should be considerably greater than for DNA, as has been reported for several bona fide RNA-binding proteins (23Ishikawa F. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). On the other hand, if some of these KH proteins were to prove to be bifunctional DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, then their affinities for DNA and RNA should prove comparable. The results presented here argue that hnRNP K, the prototype mammalian KH protein, can function as a transcription factor. First, hnRNP K binds to ssDNA more tightly than to RNA in a sequence-specific manner. Second, hnRNP K recognizes a reiterated cis-element that occurs in the natural context of the c-myc promoter. Third, hnRNP K stimulates gene expression through the CT element. Fourth, insofar as hnRNP K has separable DNA-binding and transactivation domains, it behaves structurally like most conventional gene regulatory proteins. A recent finding that hnRNP K interacts with TATA-binding protein (TBP) supports this conclusion. 3E. Michelotti and D. Levens, manuscript submitted for publication. These observations raise the possibility that other RNA-binding proteins with KH domains may also function in a process requiring DNA binding. In fact, KH domains are found in a transcription factor of the c-myc gene, FBP, and are essential for DNA binding(13Duncan R. Bazar L. Michelotti G. Tomonaga T. Krutzsch H. Avigan M. Levens D. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Might this difference in binding affinity to DNA or to RNA have any physiological relevance? A growing number of factors that bind to DNA or RNA have been reported, some preferring to bind to DNA, whereas others prefer RNA. Several prokaryotic examples serve to illustrate the utility of this dual-binding specificity. E. coli single-strand binding protein (SSB) and T4 gene 32 protein each bind to single-stranded DNA as well as their own mRNAs(24Shimamoto N. Ikushima N. Utiyama H. Tachibana H. Horie K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5241-5250Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25von Hippel P.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. Paul L.S. Stormo G.D. Gold L. J. Mol.

Chem. 1976; 251: 7263-7270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus these single-stranded DNA-binding proteins partition between intracellular single-stranded DNA and mRNA, thereby regulating their own translation. A recent report demonstrated that bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase has a 100-fold higher affinity for in vitro transcribed RNA as compared to DNA of the same sequence and suggested that the protein represses its own translation by binding to its mRNA(27Pavlov A.R. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12968-12972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partitioning of regulatory proteins between DNA and RNA is not a device unique to prokaryotes. TFIIIA, one of the best characterized eukaryotic transcription factors, partitions between 5 S rRNA and the 5 S rRNA gene, binding to each with comparable affinity(14Honda B.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1980; 22: 119-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Pelham H.R.B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4170-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The preferential binding of hnRNP K to DNA over RNA may be a requirement for transcription activation through a relatively smaller number of genomic, single-stranded CT elements operating against competing target sites in hnRNA, in hnRNPs, or directly on other proteins through protein-protein interactions. How many roles does hnRNP K play? Besides RNA metabolism and transcription, hnRNP K has recently surfaced in several unexpected contexts. hnRNP K has been shown to bind the SH3 domain of c-src through a segment of hnRNP K encoded by an alternatively spliced exon(2Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 5Taylor S.J. Shalloway D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4509-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). p95 vav also interacts both in vitro and in vivo with hnRNP K(6Hobert O. Jallal B. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20225-20228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that hnRNP K may participate in signal transduction, perhaps as a downstream effecter molecule. Additional work has demonstrated that hnRNP K binds to TBP, consistent with the idea that hnRNP K might directly modulate the transcription machinery. hnRNP K also can bind hyperphosphorylated forms of the Rb protein, 4E. Michelotti and D. Levens, unpublished data. and nuclear staining of hnRNP K has been reported to be cell cycle-dependent(29Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Rasmussen H.H. Madsen P. Kruse T.A. Gesser B. Nielsen H. Celis J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); these observations evoke the notion that hnRNP K function might be coupled to the cell cycle. The multiple complexes within which hnRNP K can be found in vivo and in vitro indicate that hnRNP K is not simply a structural component of hnRNP complexes but is an abundant multifunctional protein, partitioning between competing complexes and potentially linking several important cellular processes.

The VDR is a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, and retinoids. As such a member, the VDR acts as a ligand-induced transcription factor that binds to specific DNA elements in vitamin D-responsive genes and ultimately influences the rate of transcription(1MacDonald P.N.

Thus, in one current hypothesis, 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent gene expression is mediated by heterodimeric binding of VDR and RXR to the vitamin D-responsive element with the heterodimer serving as the functional transcription factor. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 vitamin D receptor retinoid X receptor transcription factor IIB receptor auxiliary factor retinoic acid receptor glutathione S-transferase. The mechanisms that link receptor:response element binding to alterations in RNA polymerase II transcription are not well understood but are likely to involve protein:protein interactions between the receptor and the transcription preinitiation complex. Transcription factors IIB and IID (TFIIB and TFIID) are key targets for transactivator interactions, and, in many cases, additional adapter proteins function to mediate contacts between the transactivator and these basal factors. In this regard, TAFII110 links transcription factor Sp1 to TFIID(9Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alternatively, transactivators may contact components of the basal transcription machinery directly. Both the acidic activation domain of VP16 and the glutamine-rich activation domain of the Ftz protein interact directly with TFIIB(13Lin Y.-S. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R.

Furthermore, progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor interact with TFIIB, suggesting that steroid receptor function is mediated through TFIIB interactions(16Baniahmad A.

Presently, the mechanisms linking VDR•RXR heterodimers to the transcription preinitiation complex are not known. In the current study, we demonstrate that VDR forms a highly specific, direct protein:protein contact with TFIIB. The carboxyl-terminal portion of VDR contacts TFIIB, whereas similar regions of RXR or of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) do not associate with TFIIB. All two-hybrid plasmid constructs used the pAS1 and pGAD.GH yeast expression vectors(18Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 19Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The HincII/EcoRI fragment of human RXRα cDNA was subcloned into SmaI-EcoRI-digested pGAD.GH. This vector generates a fusion between the GAL4 activation domain and RXRα (Thr223-Thr462). AS1-RARα contains the ScaI-EcoRI fragment from murine RARα cDNA subcloned in frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain in pAS1. The AS1-VDR constructs were generated by inserting restriction enzyme fragments of the human VDR cDNA into the multiple cloning site of pAS1. All amino-terminal deletion constructs were sequenced through the fusion point to confirm that the reading frame was maintained. To produce AS1-VDR(93-427), human VDR cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primer pairs: 5′-tcctgaaTTCATTCTGACAGATGAGGA-3′ and 5′-acttggaTCCTAGTCAGGAGATCTCAT-3′. The amplified product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into the pAS1 plasmid. AS1-SNF1 and GAD-SNF4 (pSE1112 and pSE1111, respectively) were previously described(18Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The HeLa cell cDNA library in the pGAD.GH vector was previously described (19Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The library was cotransformed with pAS1-VDR(93-427) into the yeast strain HF7c (ura3-52 his3-200 ade2-101 lys2-801 trp1-901 leu2-3,112 gal80-538 gal4-542 LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3 URA3:: GAL417mers(3X)-CYC1TATA-lacZ), which was made competent with lithium acetate(20Gietz D. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 20: 1425Crossref Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Transformants were plated on media lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 5 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole is a chemical inhibitor of imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase, the product of the HIS3 gene, thereby overcoming residual HIS3 expression in the HF7c strain. Colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase expression using a colony lift filter assay(19Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The indicated plasmid pairs were transformed into HF7c yeast, plated on media lacking leucine and tryptophan, and incubated for 4 days at 30°C. Triplicate colonies were grown overnight in Leu-Trp- liquid media, diluted in nutrient-rich media (A600 = 0.2), and grown to late log phase (A600 = 0.8). Cells were assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described(21Fagan R. Flint K.J. Jones N. Cell. 1994; 78: 799-811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The NcoI/EcoRI fragment of human RXRα was converted to a blunt-ended fragment and inserted into the SmaI site of pGEX-KT(22Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid produces an in frame fusion between GST and RXRα from Met198-Thr462. Full-length TFIIB and various deletion mutants were subcloned into pGEX-KT as well. All fusion proteins were expressed in the DH5α strain of bacteria and purified with glutathione-agarose(22Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Full-length VDR and RXRβ were expressed in a baculovirus expression system(7MacDonald P.N. Dowd D.R. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Haussler C.A. Ozato K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5907-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Individual GST fusion proteins (7.5 μg) were incubated with 1.3 μg of VDR in 100 μl of GBB buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). VDR was incubated with and without 1,25(OH)2D3 at a final concentration of 0.8 × 10-7M. After 1 h at 4°C, 20 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose was added, and, after 30 min at 4°C, associated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was washed 5 times in 100 volumes of GBB buffer, solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed for VDR content by Western analysis. Immunoanalysis was as previously described (3MacDonald P.N. Haussler C.A. Terpening C.M. Galligan M.A. Reeder M.C. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18808-18813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG was used as secondary antibody and development was with a chemiluminescent substrate. Based on the discovery that VDR forms heterodimers with RXR and RAF, a search was initiated to identify VDR-specific interactive proteins with a two-hybrid system described by Hannon et al.(19Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The initial constructs are illustrated in Fig. 1A. One hybrid construct contained the Gal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1-147) fused to the carboxyl-terminal region of VDR (Phe93-Ser427) and was termed AS1-VDR(93-427). A second hybrid construct contained the Gal4 activation domain (amino acids 786-881) fused to the carboxyl-terminal region of human RXRα (Thr223-Thr462), termed GAD-RXR(223-462). Interaction between the VDR and RXR domains will bring the Gal4 activation and DNA binding domains in close proximity and lead to transcriptional activation of Gal4-responsive reporter genes. To aid in the elimination of false positives, two Gal4-regulated sequences are present in HF7c yeast: 1) the lacZ gene controlled by the CYC1 basal promoter and multiple GAL4-responsive elements and 2) the HIS3 reporter gene driven by the GAL1 promoter (Fig. 1A). Consequently, interaction between AS1-VDR(93-427) and GAD-RXR(223-462) fusion proteins is characterized by monitoring the expression of β-galactosidase activity and by monitoring the growth of HF7c on selective media lacking histidine. Initial characterization of the two-hybrid system is presented in Fig. 1B. The specificity of the VDR/RXR interaction was examined using SNF1 and SNF4, authentic interacting yeast proteins. The AS1-SNF1 and GAD-SNF4 constructs expressed functional proteins since yeast transformed with this combination grew well on His-deficient media (right plate, area 3). In contrast, yeast expressing either the VDR and SNF4 combination (area 1) or the SNF1 and RXR combination (area 2) did not grow, indicating that neither the VDR nor the RXR fusion proteins interacted with the SNF proteins in this system. Importantly, specific interactions between VDR and RXR were evident as yeast expressing AS1-VDR(93-427) and GAD-RXR(223-462) grew well on histidine-deficient media (area 4). Having demonstrated specific interactions between VDR and a known partner (RXR), the AS1-VDR(93-427) plasmid was then used to screen a HeLa cell library constructed in the GAD.GH plasmid. Positive clones were selected for growth on His- media, expression of β-galactosidase activity, and specificity for interaction with the AS1-VDR(93-427) bait plasmid. The specificity controls included testing each positive clone against pAS1, pAS1-SNF1, and pAS1-RXRα. Out of about 250,000 individual clones examined in the initial screen, 12 positives conformed to these stringent criteria. DNA sequence analysis identified one of the clones as full-length human TFIIB. The remaining 11 clones are the subject of further study and will not be described here. Fig. 1B illustrates the growth properties of TFIIB in the two-hybrid system demonstrating a specific interaction with the VDR hybrid protein (area6), whereas no interaction was apparent with the AS1-SNF1 and GAD-TFIIB combination (area 5). To identify the region of VDR that contacts TFIIB, several amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of AS1-VDR were examined (Fig. 2A). Comparison of the AS1-VDR full-length construct to the AS1-VDR(93-427) and the AS1-VDR(116-427) mutants demonstrated that the zinc finger DNA binding domain of VDR is not critical for VDR-TFIIB interactions. However, eliminating the sequence between Leu116 and Ser165 of VDR abolished the interaction of VDR with TFIIB. Deleting the last 40 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal tail in AS1-VDR(93-387) also eliminated VDR-TFIIB interactions. Thus, the extreme amino-terminal(116-165) and carboxyl-terminal(387-427) regions of the ligand binding domain comprised at least two of the domains in VDR essential for TFIIB-VDR association. A similar analysis of TFIIB is presented in Fig. 2B. Elimination of most of the carboxyl terminus of TFIIB (Δ125-297 and Δ66-294) did not interfere with VDR-TFIIB interactions. In fact, these mutants appeared to interact with VDR better than full-length TFIIB, possibly due to the removal of interfering domains in TFIIB (23Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, deleting the amino-terminal regions (Δ1-42 and Δ1-123) eliminated β-galactosidase expression and growth on His-deficient media. Importantly, addition of the most extreme amino-terminal 43 residues to the Δ1-123 mutant partially restored activity, suggesting that this amino-terminal domain is sufficient to mediate TFIIB-VDR interactions. Next, we tested the specificity of this interaction with similar carboxyl-terminal domains in the related receptors, RARα and RXRα. As illustrated in Fig. 3, interactions between AS1-VDR and the GAD-RXR or GAD-TFIIB constructs were readily apparent (leftplate). However, similar regions of RXR or RAR did not interact with TFIIB as indicated by the inability of the AS1-RXR or AS1-RAR fusion proteins to couple with the GAD-TFIIB fusion and activate HIS3 expression (middle and rightplates, respectively). However, these same protein domains of RXR and RAR mediated strong interactions of RXR with VDR (Fig. 3, middleplate) and of RAR with RXR (Fig. 3, rightplate), both of which are authentic protein:protein associations previously demonstrated(5Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boutin J.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). These data indicated that TFIIB coupled specifically with the carboxyl-terminal domain of VDR and not with the carboxyl-terminal regions of RARs of RXRs. Finally, the interaction of VDR and TFIIB was examined in vitro (Fig. 4). The carboxyl-terminal region of human RXRα and full-length TFIIB were expressed as fusion proteins with GST. The purified fusion proteins were incubated with VDR in the presence and absence of the 1,25(OH)2D3 ligand. Protein complexes were precipitated with glutathione-agarose and washed extensively; the beads were analyzed for VDR content by Western analysis. Fig. 4A shows that both GST-RXRα (lanes8 and 9) and GST-TFIIB (lanes6 and 7) efficiently precipitated VDR while a 4-fold molar excess of GST did not (lanes4 and 5). Interestingly, GST-RXR precipitated over 8-fold more VDR when the latter was complexed with 1,25(OH)2D3 (lane9) compared with unliganded VDR (lane8). This response was similar to 1,25(OH)2D3-enhanced solution heterodimers of VDR and RAF previously reported(4Sone T. Kerner S. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23296-23305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, VDR-TFIIB interactions were relatively independent of ligand (compare lanes6 and 7). Fig. 4B illustrates the effect of several TFIIB deletion mutants in the in vitro VDR interaction assay. In agreement with the results of the two-hybrid system, the TFIIB(Δ1-124) mutation did not interact appreciably with VDR, while addition of amino acids 1-43 to this construct (lane2) partially restored interaction with VDR compared with wild-type TFIIB (lane1). Thus, these data indicate that the amino terminus of TFIIB mediates interactions with the VDR both in vivo and in vitro. A central question in eukaryotic transcription concerns the mechanism by which site-specific activators stimulate the transcriptional process. One current hypothesis suggests that activators function by contacting components of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. The basal transcription factor TFIIB is important in this regard. TFIIB assembly into the preinitiation complex is a rate-limiting step that is increased by direct interaction with a transactivator such as VP16(13Lin Y.-S. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 14Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a TFIIB mutant that does not interact with VP16 still functions in basal transcription but not in VP16-activated transcription(24Roberts S.G.E. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, interaction between an acidic activator and TFIIB is necessary for transcriptional activation in some systems. In the present study, we demonstrate that TFIIB forms a highly specific protein:protein contact with the VDR. The interaction was apparent both in vivo in the yeast two-hybrid interaction system and in vitro in protein interaction assays with purified TFIIB and VDR. Thus, TFIIB may be a pivotal link in the communication between VDR and the transcription preinitiation complex during vitamin Dmediated transcription. However, functional analysis of VDR and/or TFIIB mutants will be required to test this hypothesis. The carboxyl-terminal region of TFIIB contains two imperfect repeats of approximately 75 amino acids with a cluster of basic residues in the first repeat that may fold into an amphipathic α-helix(25Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1991; 352: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 26Malik S. Hisatake K. Sumimoto H. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9553-9557Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A conserved cysteine-rich sequence is present in the amino terminus that may form a zinc binding motif(27Pinto I. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Cell. 1992; 68: 977-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis and deletion analysis reveal that these two domains are functionally distinct(28Barberis A. Muller C.W. Harrison S.C. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5628-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The amino terminus may be required for recruitment of RNA polymerase II and/or TFIIF, while the carboxyl-terminal region interacts with the TATA binding protein-DNA complex. The bipartite nature of TFIIB is also evident in its interactions with VDR in that the carboxyl-terminal domain of TFIIB is dispensable for VDR coupling while the amino terminus is absolutely required. In contrast, VP16 couples to the putative amphipathic α-helix of TFIIB(24Roberts S.G.E. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and this region is not involved in VDR-TFIIB interactions. Thus, the activation domains of different classes of transcription factors may ultimately influence gene expression by interacting with distinct domains on TFIIB. Several other steroid-thyroid receptors interact with TFIIB, and different regions of each receptor mediate this interaction(16Baniahmad A. Ha I. Reinberg D. Tsai S. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8832-8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 17Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TFIIB interacts with the carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor(17Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with two distinct domains of the thyroid hormone receptor (16Baniahmad A. Ha I. Reinberg D. Tsai S. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8832-8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and with the DNA binding domain of the progesterone receptor(17Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison, the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of VDR was not crucial for VDR-TFIIB interactions (Fig. 2A). Multiple requisite domains in the carboxyl terminus of VDR were essential. Removal of either Leu116-Ser165 or Leu387-Ser427 completely abolished VDR-TFIIB interactions, and neither region on its own was sufficient to promote strong interactions with TFIIB. Both regions are rich in hydrophobic and charged amino acid residues, and, specifically, the region between Leu124 and Tyr143 has the propensity to form an amphipathic α-helix that may be potentially important in VDR-TFIIB interactions. Recent mutagenesis of VDR suggests that several widely spaced regions of the ligand binding domain also mediate VDR-RXR and VDR-RAF interactions(8Nakajima S. Hsieh J.-C. MacDonald P.N. Galligan M.A. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The extreme carboxyl-terminal residues of the VDR are also critical for VDR-RXR interactions, indicating that TFIIB and RXR may interact with a common domain in VDR. However, one aspect of the present study suggests that distinct domains of VDR interact with TFIIB and RXR since VDR-RXR interaction was enhanced by 1,25(OH)2D3, whereas the VDR-TFIIB interaction was ligand independent (Fig. 4). It is conceivable that a ligand-induced conformational change exposes a domain of the VDR involved in heterodimerization with RXR, and this domain is not directly involved in VDR interactions with TFIIB. More refined mutagenesis and binding studies are required to test this hypothesis. With regard to specificity, we noted a clear preference of TFIIB for the carboxyl terminus of VDR. TFIIB did not interact to the same extent with the carboxyl terminus of RXR (Fig. 3) nor did GST-TFIIB interact appreciably with murine RXRβ in our in vitro assay (data not shown). Our studies do not rule out the possibility that TFIIB interacts with other isoforms or with more amino-terminal domains of RARs or RXRs. However, a nearly full-length RXRα construct (AS1-RXRα (Glu46-Thr462)) showed no interaction with the TFIIB fusion in the two-hybrid system (data not shown), supporting the concept that RXR does not interact appreciably with TFIIB under these conditions. It is an intriguing possibility that the RXR portion of the heterodimer may contact the preinitiation complex through a distinct protein, such as another general transcription factor or a bridging protein. Regardless, these data indicate that fundamental differences exist in the mechanisms leading to transcriptional regulation by the nuclear receptors for retinoids and vitamin D.

It is likely that the P-opsin lineage diverged from the retinal opsins early in opsin evolution. The amino acid sequence of P-opsin is 42 to 46 percent identical to that of the retinal opsins. P-opsin is a seven-membrane spanning, G protein-linked receptor with a Schiff-base lysine in the seventh membrane span and a Schiff-base counterion in the third membrane span. The primary sequence of P-opsin suggests that it will be maximally sensitive to ∼500-nanometer light and produce a slow and prolonged phototransduction response consistent with the nonvisual function of pineal photoreception."
https://openalex.org/W2004328215,"The 130-kDa mfd gene product is required for coupling transcription to repair in Escherichia coli. Mfd displaces E. coli RNA polymerase (Pol) stalled at a lesion, binds to the damage recognition protein UvrA, and increases the template strand repair rate during transcription. Here, the interactions of Mfd (transcription-repair coupling factor, TRCF) with DNA, RNA Pol, and UvrA were investigated. TRCF bound nonspecifically to double stranded DNA; binding to DNA produced alternating DNase I-protected and -hypersensitive regions, suggesting possible wrapping of the DNA around the enzyme. Weaker binding to single stranded DNA and no binding to single stranded RNA were observed. DNA binding required ATP, and hydrolysis of ATP promoted dissociation. Removal of a stalled RNA Pol also requires ATP hydrolysis. Apparently, TRCF recognizes a stalled elongation complex by directly interacting with RNA Pol, since binding to a synthetic transcription bubble was no stronger than binding to double stranded DNA, and binding to free RNA Pol holoenzyme and to initiation and elongation complexes in the absence of adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) were observed. Structure-function analysis showed that residues 379-571 are involved in binding to a stalled RNAP. The helicase motifs region, residues 571-931, binds to ATP and duplex polynucleotide (DNA:DNA or DNA:RNA). Dissociation of the ternary complex upon hydrolysis of ATP also requires the carboxyl terminus of TRCF. Finally, residues 1-378 bind to UvrA and deliver the damage recognition component of the excision nuclease to the lesion."

In vitro editing of GluR-B RNA transcripts with HeLa cell nuclear extracts was found to result from an activity that converts adenosine to inosine in regions of double-stranded RNA by enzymatic base modification. This activity is consistent with that of a double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase previously described in Xenopus oocytes and widely distributed in mammalian tissues.

Though a variety of human cell types can be infected by <i>H. saimiri</i>, transformation appears to be specific for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Our investigation of early signaling events in <i>H. saimiri</i>-transformed T cells revealed a novel 40-kDa phosphoprotein complexed with the T cell-specific tyrosine protein kinase p56<sup>lck</sup>. This protein, termed Tip (tyrosine kinase interacting protein), is identified as a viral protein encoded by the open reading frame 1 (ORF1). In the transformed cells Tip is expressed together with the gene product of ORF2, the viral oncoprotein StpC, which acts on epithelial cells. The <i>H. saimiri</i> genome has 75 ORFs, but only ORF1 and ORF2 are transcribed in transformed human cells. Tip is phosphorylated on tyrosine in cell-free systems containing Lck, indicating that the viral protein is a substrate for this T cell-specific kinase. Alteration of T cell signaling pathways by Tip may be the second event complementing the action of StpC in a new mechanism of T cell transformation."

However, the presence of the sequon does not automatically ensure core glycosylation, as many proteins contain sequons that remain either unglycosylated or glycosylated to a variable extent. To investigate whether intracellular protein folding can influence sequon utilization, we have expressed tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in cell culture in the presence of mild concentrations of the reducing agent dithiothreitol to prevent co-translational disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that conditions that prevent disulfide bond formation lead to complete glycosylation of a sequon that otherwise undergoes variable glycosylation in untreated cells. This demonstrated that folding and disulfide bond formation of t-PA determines its extent of core N-linked glycosylation. When dithiothreitol was removed from the cells, the reduced and overglycosylated t-PA formed disulfide bonds, folded, and was secreted.

Many of the membrane and secretory proteins synthesized by eukaryotic cells undergo modification during their synthesis by the N-linked addition of oligosaccharides to specific asparagine residues(1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar). This modification plays an important role in regulating the activity, stability, and antigenicity of the mature protein(2Rademacher R.W. Parekh R.B. Dwek R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 785-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Aside from the physiological roles of N-linked oligosaccharides, a picture is now emerging where N-linked oligosaccharides are central in facilitating the folding, transport, cell surface expression, and secretion of glycoproteins(3Shakin-Eshleman S.H.

(5Rothman J.E. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1977; 269: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The initial step, core glycosylation, is catalyzed by the enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase, which is associated with the lumenal surface of the ER membrane(1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev.

Although the sequon is essential for core glycosylation, numerous examples of glycoproteins have been observed containing either unglycosylated sequons or sequons that are glycosylated to a variable extent(10Plummer Jr., T.H.

The selectivity of sequon utilization suggests that additional regulatory mechanisms operate during core glycosylation to determine the extent of glycosylation of a given protein. The frequency of sequon utilization may be dependent upon the relative lumenal concentrations of oligosaccharyltransferase, dolichol donor and acceptor protein(13Carson D.D. Earles B.J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11552-11557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Konrad M. Merz W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8659-8666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These factors are reflected in cell culture where the relative amounts of glycoforms synthesized for a constitutive or recombinant glycoprotein depend upon both the expression system used and the culture conditions employed(12Curling E.M.A. Hayter P.M.

Biol. 1988; 8: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Previous studies in vitro using membrane extracts as source of oligosaccharyltransferase to glycosylate polypeptide substrates identified the requirement of short range interactions within the sequon, necessary for reactivity between asparagine and the glycosyl donor(16Bause E. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 17Bause E. Legler G. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Similar experiments demonstrated that unglycosylated or variably glycosylated sequons in native substrates could undergo complete glycosylation if denatured prior to glycosylation(18Pless D.D. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this present study we use t-PA as a model secretory glycoprotein to test whether disulfide bond formation within the ER of living cells can influence the frequency of sequon utilization. Human t-PA is a 70-kDa serine protease that contains 17 disulfide bonds and is secreted from human and recombinant mammalian cell lines as a mixture of two glycoforms that differ in their extent of core glycosylation. Type I t-PA undergoes core glycosylation at Asn-117, Asn-184, and Asn-448; type II t-PA is identical except for lacking core glycosylation at Asn-184(11Pohl G. Kallstrom M. Bergsdorf N. Wallen P. Jornvall H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3701-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cell-free synthesis of t-PA under conditions favoring disulfide bond formation reduced the likelihood of core glycosylation at Asn-184(19Bulleid N.J. Bassel-Duby R.S. Freedman R.B. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is likely that during co-translational translocation into the lumen of the ER, the folding intermediate that satisfies both the accessibility of the sequon to oligosaccharyltransferase and the glycosyl donor may only be transient resulting in inefficient core glycosylation of Asn-184. Recently several groups have demonstrated that co-translational disulfide bond formation, folding, and oligomerization of proteins within the ER can be reversibly inhibited by the addition of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) to the culture medium of living cells(20Braakman I.

Disulfide bond formation, folding, and oligomerization were shown to recommence post-translationally on removal of DTT. Such treatments were shown to have no deleterious effects upon translation, translocation, and N-linked glycosylation. A similar approach was adopted in this study to achieve the temporal separation of N-linked glycosylation from the disulfide bond formation of nascent t-PA in the ER of CHO cells. A pulse-chase approach in conjunction with immunoprecipitation and reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE was used to monitor core glycosylation, disulfide bond formation and secretion of t-PA. Our results demonstrate that co-translational disulfide bond formation of t-PA can be inhibited in vivo with mild concentrations of DTT. Synthesis of t-PA under these conditions resulted in complete glycosylation of the otherwise variably glycosylated Asn-184. On removal of DTT from the cell culture medium, this overglycosylated t-PA could fold post-translationally and undergo normal secretion. Finally, secreted t-PA was shown to be less susceptible to reduction than t-PA present within cells unless pretreated with a denaturing reagent. Recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO 1-15500; catalog no. CRL 9606) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Tissue culture reagents were purchased from GIBCO Life Technologies Ltd. (Glasgow, Scotland). Goat anti-human t-PA polyclonal antibody was purchased from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). EXPRE35S35S [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine protein labeling mixture was purchased from DuPont NEN (Dreiech, Germany). Endoglycosidase H was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (East Sussex, United Kingdom). Human t-PA was purchased from Integrated Genetics (Framingham, MA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma (Dorset, United Kingdom). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, stably transfected to express t-PA, (American Type Culture Collection), were grown as monolayers in Ham's F-12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. CHO cells at 90% confluence were washed twice with methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, then preincubated in the same medium for 20 min at 37°C. Each monolayer was pulse-labeled with 100 μCi of EXPRE35S35S label in 5 ml of above prewarmed medium/100-mm dish for 10 min at 37°C. DTT was included in the pulse medium, where indicated, to give a final concentration of 5 mM. The pulse was ended by adding 5 ml of prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5 mM each of unlabeled methionine and cysteine. Cycloheximide (500 μM) was included in the chase medium to block completion of labeled nascent chains. DTT (5 mM) was included in the chase medium where indicated. After chase times up to 3 h, the cells were transferred to ice and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mMN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to prevent formation or rearrangement of disulfide bonds in the protein. The cells were lysed with 750 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer/dish (buffer: 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM NEM, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Lysates were adjusted to 1.5 ml with lysis buffer, then spun for 15 min at 12,000 × g to pellet nuclei and cell debris. Cell lysates (300 μl) and culture medium (750 μl) were made up to a final volume of 1 ml with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide). Samples were preincubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10% (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at 4°C to preclear the samples of protein A binding components. Precleared samples were each incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose and 5 μg of goat anti-human t-PA polyclonal antibody for 15 h at 4°C. The complexes were washed three times with fresh immunoprecipitation buffer, and then prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE with or without prior endoglycosidase treatment as described below. For endoglycosidase H digestion, after washing the immunoprecipitates, the final pellet was resuspended in 15 μl of dissolution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1% (w/v) SDS), and boiled for 5 min. An equal volume of endoglycosidase H digestion buffer (150 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5, containing 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide), was added to each sample then incubated for various times with 1 milliunit of endoglycosidase H at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mM DTT. Samples of purified t-PA (8 μg) were incubated in the absence of urea and in the presence of 0-100 mM DTT for 10 min at 37°C. Alternatively, samples were incubated in the presence of 0-6 M urea for 10 min at 37°C and for another 10 min in the presence of 5 mM DTT. NEM was added to each sample to a final concentration of 200 mM to quench the DTT and alkyate any free thiols. Finally, an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to each sample. Immunoprecipitation pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.004% (w/v) bromphenol blue). DTT (50 mM) was added to reduced samples where indicated. All samples, reduced and non-reduced, were boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoresis. Cooled samples were loaded into the wells of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. Gels were stained, fixed, dried under vacuum, and visualized by either autoradiography using Kodak XAR-5 film or imaged using a Fujix Bas2000 phosphorimager. Human t-PA is secreted from human and recombinant cell lines as a mixture of two glycoforms that differ in their extent of core N-linked glycosylation. A previous study using a cell-free translation system supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomes suggested that this variability of core glycosylation was dependent upon the ability of t-PA to fold and form disulfide bonds (19Bulleid N.J. Bassel-Duby R.S. Freedman R.B. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To investigate whether disulfide bond formation and protein folding actually determine the extent of core N-linked glycosylation in living cells, we applied a pulse-chase approach to cultured CHO cells stably transfected with the cDNA encoding human t-PA. CHO cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine and -cysteine at 37°C for 10 min in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of DTT in the labeling medium. The cells were cooled immediately and then treated with the membrane-permeable alkylating agent NEM to block free thiols and prevent further rearrangement of disulfide bonds. The cells were lysed and the post-nuclear supernatant immunoprecipitated with a goat polyclonal anti-tPA. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to both reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The t-PA synthesized during the 10-min labeling period in the absence of DTT migrated as a doublet band when reduced prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 1, lane1), indicating that variable glycosylation of Asn-184 had occurred. When subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, lane1) t-PA migrated with a greater mobility and with a more diffuse banding pattern than on reducing gels, indicating that during the 10-min labeling period t-PA had formed intramolecular disulfide bonds. As the concentration of DTT present during the labeling period was increased from 0 to 5 mM, the doublet pattern progressively disappeared until only a single band was present at concentrations of DTT above 1 mM (lanes2-10). This change in banding pattern was coincident with a progressive reduction in the formation of disulfide bonds. Thus, at 1 mM DTT no disulfide bonds were formed as no faster migrating bands were present when the sample was run under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1, lowerpanel). To ascertain the number of oligosaccharide side chains present on the t-PA polypeptide synthesized either in the absence or presence of DTT, we carried out a limited endoglycosidase H digestion. As t-PA contains three glycosylation sites that are known to be glycosylated (11Pohl G. Kallstrom M. Bergsdorf N. Wallen P. Jornvall H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3701-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we would expect to see four products after limited digestion corresponding to tri-, di-, mono-, and unglycosylated t-PA. This was indeed the case for both t-PA synthesized in the absence of DTT (Fig. 2a) and in the presence of DTT (Fig. 2b). This demonstrates conclusively that t-PA synthesized in the presence of DTT was exclusively the triglycosylated type 1 t-PA. A clear difference in mobility of type 1 t-PA synthesized in the absence or presence of 5 mM DTT (Fig. 1, lanes1 and 10) was observed. Thus, t-PA synthesized in the presence of DTT had a reduced mobility, which could result either from alkylation of the 34 free thiol groups or an effect of DTT on oligosaccharide processing. To investigate the cause of this increase in mobility, we repeated the experiment in the absence of alkylating agents and fully deglycosylated the t-PA with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 3). When cells were lysed in the absence of NEM, the t-PA synthesized in the presence of DTT had a greater mobility than when cells were lysed in the presence of NEM (compare lanes3 and 4). These differences in mobility were still evident after deglycosylation (lanes7 and 8), demonstrating that this effect is due to differential alkylation of disulfide-bonded t-PA relative to non-disulfide-bonded t-PA. It was clear that when disulfide bond formation and folding of t-PA was prevented in the ER, t-PA was synthesized exclusively as the type I glycoform. To investigate whether reduced and overglycosylated t-PA synthesized under these conditions could form a native complement of disulfide bonds within the ER, we chased the reduced t-PA in the absence of DTT. Cycloheximide was also included in the chase medium to inhibit protein synthesis. Cells were chased for up to 120 min, treated with NEM, lysed, and t-PA precipitated using the polyclonal antibody. A time course for intracellular disulfide bond formation in non-treated and DTT-treated cells was constructed by separating the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions (Fig. 4, a and b). When CHO cells were labeled for 10 min in the absence of 5 mM DTT, non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4a, upperpanel) revealed a diffuse band at 0 min into the chase, indicating that disulfide bond formation in t-PA was near completion 10 min into synthesis. When CHO cells were pulse labeled for 10 min in the presence of 5 mM DTT, non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4b, upperpanel) revealed a sharp band at 0 min into the chase, indicating that no disulfide bond formation had occurred. After 5 min of the chase, the band became more diffuse and downshifted, indicating partial disulfide bond formation. By 10 min of the chase, there was an additional increase in mobility, which was also observed when the samples were reduced prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 4b, lowerpanel). As described above, this was due to differential alkylation of partially oxidized t-PA. No further increase in mobility was observed after 45 min of chase. These results indicate that disulfide bond formation was complete between 30 and 45 min into the chase. At later time points, there was a decrease in the intensity of t-PA immunoprecipitated, suggesting that t-PA was either being transported out the cell or degraded. An increase in intensity of t-PA precipitated during the chase period after labeling in the presence of DTT was observed (Fig. 4b). This could reflect a lack of protein synthesis inhibition by cycloheximide. However, this is unlikely to be the case, as no such increase is observed when DTT was not present in the labeling period (Fig. 4a). We also increased the concentration of cycloheximide in the chase from 0.5 mM to 5 mM with identical results (data not shown). In addition, any protein synthesized during the chase period would be variably glycosylated as the redox conditions within the ER are restored rapidly (23Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20598-20605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that the antibody used for immunoprecipitation has a reduced affinity for non-disulfide-bonded alkylated t-PA, and as a consequence more t-PA is immunoprecipitated as the protein folds and forms disulfide bonds during the chase period. To test this we took two equal volumes of cell lysate, one of which was treated with 100 mM NEM while the other sample was reduced with 100 mM DTT and then treated with 100 mM NEM. Both samples were passed through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated in immunoprecipitation buffer to remove DTT and NEM from the samples prior to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE (data not shown) and the amount of t-PA precipitated quantitated by phosphorimage analysis. Only 12.5% of the t-PA precipitated from the non-reduced sample was precipitated from the reduced sample, demonstrating that the antibody used has a reduced affinity for non-disulfide-bonded t-PA. The increase in intensity of the immunoprecipitates from the DTT-treated cells during the chase in the absence of DTT therefore reflects post-translational folding and disulfide bond formation during this period. The next stage of our study was to investigate whether t-PA folded post-translationally had undergone the conformational maturation required for its exit from the ER, transport to the Golgi apparatus, and secretion from the cell. To monitor intracellular transport, we treated samples with endoglycosidase H. This approach takes advantage of the fact that high mannose ER forms of secretory glycoproteins are sensitive to deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H, whereas mannose-trimmed secretory proteins exit the ER and are resistant to deglycosylation. However, no detectable difference in electrophoretic mobility was observed after endoglycosidase H treatment for both t-PA synthesized in the absence or presence of 5 mM DTT during the 180 min of chase (results not shown). This observation may be explained by the fact that t-PA secreted from CHO cells carries high mannose oligosaccharides at Asn-117 (26Pohl G. Kenne L. Nilsson B. Einarsson M. Blood. 1987; 81: 1312-1322Google Scholar, 27Spellman M.W. Basa L.J. Leonard C.K. Chakel J.A. O'Connor J.V. Wilson S. van Halbeek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14100-14111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that various cell lines transfected with t-PA cDNA secrete unusually high amounts of core glycosylated t-PA(28Sambrook J. Hanahan D. Rodgers L. Gething M.-J. Mol. Biol. Med. 1986; 3: 459-481PubMed Google Scholar). The alternative approach to demonstrate transport competency of t-PA after removal of DTT from the cells was to determine whether the t-PA could leave the cell. When t-PA was labeled for 10 min in the absence of 5 mM DTT, a band was observed in the immunoprecipitates from the cell lysates immediately after the pulse (Fig. 5a, upperpanel). Between 75 and 240 min of the chase, there was a decrease in the intensity of t-PA immunoprecipitated from the cellular fraction (Fig. 5a, upperpanel). This was accompanied by the appearance and subsequent increase in intensity of a doublet band immunoprecipitated from the chase medium. By 240 min of the chase time, the bulk of the t-PA immunoprecipitated was present in the medium (Fig. 5a, lowerpanel), although a small amount of t-PA was detected in the cell at 240 min of chase (Fig. 5a, upperpanel). This indicated that from its initial synthesis, the fastest moving t-PA molecules took between 70 and 80 min to reach the cell surface, whereas the slowest moving t-PA molecules took over 240 min. This asynchrony in the transport pattern of t-PA in CHO cells has been observed in other cell lines secreting recombinant t-PA (28Sambrook J. Hanahan D. Rodgers L. Gething M.-J. Mol. Biol. Med. 1986; 3: 459-481PubMed Google Scholar) as well as recombinant membrane proteins such as influenza hemagglutinin(29Sambrook J. Rodgers L. White J. Gething M.-J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When t-PA was labeled for 10 min in the presence of 5 mM DTT, a sharp singlet band was observed immediately after the pulse (Fig. 5b, upperpanel), indicating the presence of only type I t-PA in the intracellular fraction. There was a reduction in the intensity of the intracellular t-PA immunoprecipitated between 75 and 240 min of the chase time, until no intracellular t-PA was detectable after 240 min (Fig. 5b, upperpanel). Accompanying the disappearance of t-PA immunoprecipitated from the intracellular fraction between 180 and 240 min of the chase (Fig. 5b, upperpanel), there was the appearance and subsequent increase in the intensity of a singlet band in the immunoprecipitates from the chase medium between 75 and 240 min (Fig. 5b, lowerpanel), indicating that the secretion of t-PA was complete between 180 and 240 min of the chase. Therefore, the fastest moving t-PA molecules took between 80 and 90 min to reach the cell surface, and the slowest took between 180 and 240 min to reach the surface from their initial synthesis within the ER, indicating a recovery time of approximately 10 min after DTT treatment. Although newly synthesized secretory proteins may be retained within the ER after treatment of cells with mild concentrations of DTT, several groups have established that these effects are only specific to immature disulfide-containing proteins (21Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 23Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol.

These studies have shown that the transport and secretion of proteins without disulfide bonds or proteins that are fully oxidized are not affected by subsequent treatment with DTT. As t-PA contains a high number of disulfide bonds in relation to its molecular weight, we investigated the effect of mild concentrations of DTT on disulfide-bonded t-PA present within the cell in comparison with secreted t-PA. CHO cells were pulsed for 10 min and then chased for 40 min in the absence of DTT. At this time, t-PA should have completed disulfide bond formation but still remains in a pre-Golgi compartment (see Fig. 4). The cells were chased for an additional 180 min in the presence of 5 mM DTT. The cells were lysed at regular intervals during the 180 min in the presence of 20 mM NEM, and t-PA immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 6). A t-PA band was observed immediately after the 40-min chase when the immunoprecipitates were reduced prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 6, 0 min), which migrated as a diffuse downshifted band when separated under non-reducing conditions, indicating that disulfide bond formation had occurred. Between 0 and 120 min of the chase, there was an upshift in the mobility of t-PA until a sharp doublet remained, indicating that t-PA became completely reduced between 60 and 120 min after the addition of DTT. There was a decrease in the intensity of t-PA in the cells during the chase until no t-PA was detectable after 180 min. No t-PA was secreted into the medium during this chase period (results not shown). This decrease is probably due to a combination of factors including the reduced affinity of the antibody for non-disulfide-bonded t-PA, nonspecific aggregation, and degradation. The alternative approach involved incubation of purified human t-PA in vi"
https://openalex.org/W2042639517,"The transcription repair coupling factor (TRCF) of Escherichia coli has the so-called helicase motifs, is a DNA-, RNA Pol-, and UvrA-binding protein, and is required for the coupling of repair to transcription. We investigated the potential helicase, transcription termination, and transcription-repair coupling activities of TRCF on various substrates. We found that TRCF does not have a helicase activity on any of the substrates tested. However, the TRCF releases both RNA Pol and the truncated transcript from a transcriptional road block caused by a lesion, a “missing base,” or a DNA-bound protein. It does not have any effect on rho-dependent or rho-independent transcriptional termination. However, some premature terminations were induced by TRCF at other sites. The coupling of transcription to repair occurs with supercoiled and relaxed circular DNA and with linear DNA. However, the coupling with linear DNA is strongly affected by the length of the DNA and does not occur with fragments in which the lesion is closer than 90 nucleotides to the 5′ terminus of the template strand. Under transcription conditions the repair of lesions in the promoter region and up to the eleventh transcribed base is inhibited even in the presence of TRCF. Stimulation of repair in the transcribed strand starts at lesions at +15 nucleotides. Stimulation of repair occurs via facilitating the delivery of the A2B1 complex to the lesion site by the TCRF and can be inhibited by excess UvrA which binds to the TRCF off DNA. In vitro, strand-specific repair is not dependent on the MutL and MutS proteins which have recently been implicated in preferential repair in vivo.

In vitro, strand-specific repair is not dependent on the MutL and MutS proteins which have recently been implicated in preferential repair in vivo. Escherichia coli RNA polymerase is blocked by bulky lesions including pyrimidine dimers in the template strand, and the stalled complex makes the lesion inaccessible to the nucleotide excision repair enzyme, the (A)BC excinuclease (Selby and Sancar, 1990). A transcription-repair coupling factor (TRCF) 1The abbreviations used are: TRCFtranscription-repair coupling factorMfdmutation frequency declinebpbase pair(s)ntnucleotidePolpolymerase. encoded by the mfd gene (Selby et al., 1991) releases the stalled RNA polymerase and promotes the preferential repair of the transcribed strand (Mellon and Hanawalt, 1989; Selby and Sancar, 1991, 1993). The sequence of the Mfd protein revealed so-called helicase motifs found in a number of helicases including the rho protein from E. coli (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993) which has properties similar to TRCF in terms of dissociating ternary transcription complexes (see Richardson (1993)). Therefore, we investigated the effects of TRCF for helicase activity as well as for activities relating to rho factor such as releasing RNA Pol from pause sites, from protein blocks, or from ternary complexes formed as a result of a “missing base.” We found that TRCF differs from rho in many aspects of its action mechanism but acts similarly to rho on elongation complexes stalled by a “protein road block.” transcription-repair coupling factor mutation frequency decline base pair(s) nucleotide polymerase. The mechanism of transcription-coupled repair was also investigated by determining the effect of substrate size, the location of the lesion relative to the promoter, the concentrations of the UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC subunits, and the presence or absence of MutL and MutS proteins on the coupling reaction. Our results reveal that coupling cannot occur before the σ subunit is released from the ternary transcription complex and that a lesion must be ≥90 nt away from the 5′ end of the transcribed strand for transcription-repair coupling to occur. Furthermore, by conducting the reaction with varying amounts of UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins it was found that the levels of UvrA and UvrB, but not that of UvrC, were critical for the preferential repair of the template strand. Under our in vitro assay conditions neither MutL nor MutS (which have recently been implicated in strand-specific repair) are required for transcription-repair coupling. E. coli strains AB1157 (wild type with respect to repair), ES1484 (mutL218::Tn10), and ES1481 (mutS215::Tn10) were obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (Yale University). The TRCF, its truncated derivative t-TRCF and deletion constructs fused to maltose-binding protein were constructed and purified as described previously (Selby and Sancar, 1995). The UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins were purified as described by Thomas et al.(1985). RNA polymerase was purchased from Promega and Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals. Rho was a kind gift of Dr. John P. Richardson (Indiana University). Helicase II (UvrD protein) was kindly provided by Dr. S. N. Matson (University of North Carolina). EcoRI (E111G) was kindly provided by Dr. J. Griffith (University of North Carolina). MutS protein was kindly provided by Dr. P. Modrich (Duke University). The pDR3274 plasmid used for transcription/repair assays has been described previously (Selby and Sancar, 1991, 1993). Both the repair synthesis assay (described in the accompanying paper; Selby and Sancar, 1995) and the nicking assays were used to measure repair. In the nicking assay the DNA is linearized, the template strand is terminally labeled, and the UV-irradiated DNA is then used in a transcription/repair reaction in which the repair is measured by the appearance of nicks in the irradiated DNA (Selby and Sancar, 1993). Two types of templates were employed. To study the effect of TRCF on rho-dependent and rho-independent transcription terminations, a 1250-bp BstEII fragment carrying the lac UV5 promoter and the first 479 bp of lacZ was isolated from pMC1. This region of the lacZ transcriptional unit contains both rho-dependent and -independent transcription termination sites (Ruteshouser and Richardson, 1989). A single round transcription protocol was used. Reactions in either repair buffer (40 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 100 mM KCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 4% glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) or glutamate buffer (40 mM Tris acetate, 6 mM magnesium acetate, 150 mM potassium glutamate, and 2 mM ATP, pH 7.8) were conducted in two steps. First, RNA Pol (0.03 unit, Boehringer Mannheim) and the TRCF derivative were incubated with the template at 37°C for 10 min in 25 μl. Then 25 μl of repair or glutamate buffer with additions was added to bring GTP and UTP each to 270 μM, CTP to 20 μM, [32P]CTP to 4 μCi per reaction and rifampicin to 22 μg/ml. Incubation continued at 37°C for 20 min (unless otherwise indicated), and then samples were processed for analysis of RNA on 3.6% sequencing gels. pMC1 was generously provided by Dr. J. P. Richardson. An additional template used to examine rho-independent termination was the approximately 400-bp PvuII fragment purified from pGFIB-I (Normanly et al., 1986). This template bears a synthetic promoter upstream from the transcription termination sequences from the E. coli rrnC operon. pGFIB-I was generously provided by Dr. M. J. Rogers (Yale University). To study the effect of TRCF on transcription termination caused by a protein bound within the transcription unit, we used the pUNC211 template which contains the tac promoter (Thomas et al., 1985). This template contains an EcoRI site 270-275 bp downstream from the transcription start point. Binding of the EcoRI-E111Q mutant (King et al., 1989; Wright et al., 1989) at an EcoRI site blocks transcription causing the formation of a stable elongation complex (Pavco and Steege, 1990). pUNC211 was linearized with PvuII, which cleaves downstream from the EcoRI site to give a 465-base runoff transcript. Reactions, 24 μl, were initiated by mixing the template with E111Q (37 μg/ml) in 40 mM Tris, pH 7.75, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After 10 min at 37°C, 0.06 unit of RNA Pol (Promega) was added in 1 μl and incubation continued for 10 min at 37°C. Then 25 μl of repair buffer was added to bring MgCl2 to 4 mM, ATP to 1 mM, GTP and UTP to 200 μM each, CTP to 20 μM, [α-32P]CTP to 5 μCi/reaction, rifampicin to 22 μg/ml, and where indicated, TRCF to 270 nM. Incubation continued for 20 min at 37°C. Then 50 μl of repair buffer was added to bring KCl to 1 M, and after 10 min at 37°C, reactions were stopped and RNA was analyzed on 3.6% sequencing gels. The substrates for DNA:DNA and DNA:RNA helicase assays were prepared by the method of Matson et al. (1983). The substrate for helicase activity on a RNA-DNA hybrid with a 5′-tail was prepared as described previously (Brennan et al., 1987). The RNA:DNA bubble duplex described in the accompanying paper (Selby and Sancar, 1995), was prepared as described by Daube and von Hippel(1992). The only difference was that the DNA strands were 90 nt in length. The “transcription bubble” generated by mismatch between the two strands was 12 nucleotides in length. The RNA was 20 nt with 12 nt hybridized to the “transcribed” strand and 8 nucleotides (all U) as the “free” non-hybridized 5′-tail (Daube and von Hippel, 1992). Helicase assays employed 30-min incubations of protein with substrate at 37°C in repair buffer. The TRCF has the so-called “helicase motifs” found in a number of DNA and RNA helicases (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993). However, our initial tests with DNA:DNA and 5′-tail-RNA:DNA substrates failed to reveal any such activity (Selby and Sancar, 1993). Considering the fact that in an elongation complex about 12 nucleotides of the transcript are hybridized with the template (Gamper and Hearst, 1982), and that TRCF releases both RNA Pol and the truncated RNA from a stalled elongation complex, it could be argued that TRCF does have a helicase activity that can be detected only with the appropriate substrate or with the appropriate concentrations of the protein. Therefore, we decided to investigate the helicase effect of TRCF in more detail. The helicase assay results in Fig. 1A compare TRCF with a bona fide helicase, the helicase II of E. coli, and the UvrAB complex which can dissociate oligomers <50 nt from a single-stranded M13 DNA (Oh and Grossman, 1987). The results in Fig. 1A were generated using a 17-nt oligomer annealed to M13 phage DNA. As expected, helicase II releases the 17-mer readily and the A2B1 complex releases it with about 1% the efficiency of helicase II. In contrast, TRCF even at micromolar concentrations failed to act as a helicase on this substrate. Having failed to detect a helicase activity with the conventional substrate we tested DNA:DNA, DNA:RNA, and DNA:(5′-tail)RNA duplexes as substrates since these more closely resemble the structures acted upon in a stalled transcription complex. Fig. 1B reveals that while helicase II is capable of dissociating these complexes the TRCF is not. We conclude that TRCF is not an RNA:DNA helicase and does not have a rho-like helicase activity on RNA:DNA hybrids with an RNA tail >40-nt long (Brennan et al., 1987). Consequently, we wished to use a synthetic DNA construct even closer in structure to that found in a transcription bubble. We constructed a 90-nt long duplex with a mismatch which created a bubble to which a 20-nt long RNA was hybridized to create an RNA(5′-tail):DNA bubble duplex (Daube and von Hippel, 1992). Fig. 1C reveals that the TRCF failed to release RNA from this structure. We conclude that the TRCF is a protein with the so-called helicase motifs but with no overt helicase activity. Both rho and TRCF release stalled RNA polymerase complexes although their requirements for interaction with such complexes might be different. To test for potential functional similarities between rho and TCRF we employed a DNA template with the lac UV5 promoter and rho-dependent and rho-independent transcription termination sites as well as “natural” pause sites for RNA Pol (Zou and Richardson, 1991). Fig. 2A shows that the TRCF does not affect transcription termination at either rho-dependent or rho-independent termination sites but it may affect termination at natural pause sites (see below). A curious effect that was observed in these experiments remains to be explained. In experiments with the template used in Fig. 2B, the presence of TRCF caused more than half of the transcripts to be over twice the size of the run-off transcript (Fig. 2B, lane 5) as though TRCF enables RNA Pol to switch templates at the end of the fragment and transcribe the complemetary strand. Of the various TRCF mutants tested two constructs, C-X (residues 379-1148) and C-V (residues 579-1148) appear to have an effect on transcription which is to cause premature termination in a fraction of the molecules (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 7). These results, taken together, suggest that TRCF interacts with elongation complex but most importantly reveal that TRCF has no role in physiological (non-damage dependent) transcription termination. These data also explain why rho null mutants are lethal (Richardson, 1993) but TRCF null mutants are not (Selby and Sancar, 1995). Repressors inhibit transcription by interfering with the binding of RNA Pol to the promoter and by blocking the progression of RNA Pol (see Pavco and Steege(1990)). In addition, genes may contain pseudosites for specific DNA binding proteins and these sites may be occupied at sufficiently high frequency to interfere with gene expression. Therefore, it is of interest to know whether RNA Pol is blocked by site-specifically bound proteins other than repressors and whether such blocks can be overcome by TRCF. Previously, it has been shown that an active site mutant of EcoRI (E111Q) when bound stably to an EcoRI site blocks transcription, and a stable elongation complex forms at the block site. When the E111Q is released by increasing the ionic strength, RNA Pol resumes transcription and elongates the truncated transcript (Pavco and Steege, 1990). However, if the rho protein is added to the stalled complex, it displaces RNA Pol and the truncated transcript from the road block (Pavco and Steege, 1990). When an analagous experiment was conducted it was found that TRCF functioned the same as rho factor (Fig. 3). The addition of TRCF to RNA Pol blocked by EcoRI (E111Q) releases most of the transcript in truncated form, presumably by releasing RNA Pol as well. Subsequent dissociation of EcoRI (E111Q) by high salt results only in a small fraction of full-length transcripts (compare lanes 2 and 4). Thus, we conclude that the TRCF is capable of dissociating stalled RNA Pol complexes blocked either by a lesion or by a specifically bound protein. (A)BC excinuclease activity is generally unaffected by the topology of the damaged DNA substrate (see Selby and Sancar(1994)). In contrast, binding of RNA Pol to promoters and the rate of closed to open complex isomerization are effected by the superhelicity of the template (Mulligan et al., 1985). In view of this influence of topology on RNA Pol, we examined whether the topology of the template/substrate influenced transcription-coupled repair. The tac promoter-based transcriptional unit in pDR3274 is well suited for such experiments since the strength of this promoter is relatively unaffected by superhelicity (Mulligan et al., 1985). We compared the levels of transcription-repair coupling in UV-irradiated pDR3274 that was supercoiled, relaxed, or linearized. The results shown in Fig. 4 confirm that repair of UV-damaged DNA is unaffected by superhelicity, and furthermore, the results clearly show that transcription-repair coupling also is unaffected by the DNA topology. The pDR3274 plasmid which contains the tac promoter was linearized with EcoRI which digests 235-bp upstream from the transcription start site. The template strand was 3′ terminally labeled, the DNA was irradiated with UV and then the template/substrate was treated with (A)BC excinuclease, which incises at the fourth phosphodiester bond 3′ and the eighth phosphodiester bond 5′ to the photoproduct. Incision assay reaction products resolved on a 3.6% sequencing gel are shown in Fig. 5. In the absence of TRCF, the binary complex at the promoter, and the elongation complexes throughout the transcriptional unit inhibit repair of the template strand (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 5A, and lanes 7 and 8 in Fig. 5B). When TRCF is also included in the reaction mixture (lane 3 in Fig. 5A, and lane 9 in Fig. 5B) the repair in the area of the promoter to +11 is still inhibited. However, starting at the lesion at +15, the repair of all lesions downstream is stimulated, albeit to varying degrees. Thus, even though TRCF interacts with both binary and elongation complexes (Selby and Sancar, 1995), the coupling factor can only stimulate the excision of lesions blocking RNA Pol after it has entered its elongation mode. We were also interested to know if the distance between the lesion and the promoter distal end of the fragment had an effect on transcription-repair coupling, since a short (138 bp) template/substrate did not undergo transcription-stimulated repair (Selby and Sancar, 1993), and DNA binding studies revealed some evidence that the template may wrap around the TRCF during the coupling reaction (Selby and Sancar, 1995). The end-labeled pDR3274 substrate/template was digested with two enzymes to generate fragments with termini 102 and 401 nt downstream from the transcriptional start site. In a transcription/repair reaction (Fig. 5B) with the 5′ end of the template strand a distance of 102 bp from the start site, only the incision at +15 is stimulated by the TRCF (lane 3), indicating that there must be a distance of about 87 nt between the lesion and the 5′ end of the template strand for coupling to occur. This conclusion is supported by an inspection of lanes 6 and 9, where it is seen that excision of lesions that are within about 90 bp from the terminus of the fragment in lane 6 are not stimulated by the TRCF, but that the repair of the same lesions is stimulated in lane 9 in which the 5′ terminus of the template strand is much farther than 90 nt for lesions corresponding to those examined in lane 6. To conclude, on a linear fragment a lesion must be about +15 from the transcriptional start site and 90 nt away from the 5′ end of the template strand in order to be subject to transcription-stimulated repair. In nucleotide excision repair the UvrB subunit is delivered to the damage site by the molecular matchmaking activity of the damage recognition subunit, UvrA; the two form an A2B1 complex which binds to and locally denatures DNA. UvrA then dissociates, leaving the UvrB subunit bound to the lesion site (Orren and Sancar, 1989; Sancar and Hearst, 1993). The UvrB-DNA complex is then recognized by UvrC which upon binding induces UvrB to make the 3′ incision which in turn enables UvrC to make the 5′ incision (Lin and Sancar, 1992). A kinetic analysis has shown that formation of the UvrB-DNA complex is the rate-limiting step (Orren and Sancar, 1990). Therefore, it is predicted that the TRCF will enhance the rate of repair of the transcribed strand by enhancing the rate of this step. We have no available method for directly measuring the rates of various steps under transcription enhanced repair conditions. We attempted to test this prediction by supplementing the cell-free extract which performs transcription-repair coupling with each of the three proteins (Fig. 6). The following results are observed. Addition of UvrA at 6 nM stimulates both transcription-coupled repair in the tac transcriptional unit, and overall repair in the tet gene, which is not appreciably transcribed under our reaction conditions (lanes 5 and 6). At higher concentrations of UvrA, coupling is inhibited while overall repair is still stimulated (lanes 7 and 8). These data are consistent with UvrA being one of the limiting factors in transcription repair coupling and in excision repair. At physiological concentrations most of UvrA is in the form of A2B1 complex (Orren and Sancar, 1989); by increasing the UvrA concentration the amount of free UvrA is increased which now can bind to TRCF and interfere with its coupling function (lanes 7 and 8). This is supported by the fact that the anticoupling effect of UvrA can be overcome by high TRCF concentration (lanes 9 and 10). UvrB also increases the rate of coupled as well as transcription-independent repair when added to the CFE (lanes 2-4). However, the effect of UvrB differs from that of UvrA in two important aspects. The stimulatory effect of UvrB is more pronounced than that of UvrA, and even at very high concentrations the coupling does occur even though the difference in the rates of repair of the template and coding strands is less at high UvrB concentrations. The data is consistent with the turnover of UvrA as the rate-limiting step in excision repair, a step that involves dissociation of UvrA from the A2B1-damaged DNA preincision complex via reformation of the free A2B1 damage recognition complex. As the rate of damage recognition increases, the difference between the coupled and uncoupled repair decreases. In contrast, addition of a high concentration of UvrC has no detectable effect on the rates of either overall or coupled repair (lane 1) consistent with the notion that the loading of UvrB onto the damage site by the A2B1 complex, and aided by TRCF at transcribed regions is the rate-limiting step. Strand-specific repair has been reconstituted in vitro in a completely defined system without the addition of MutL or MutS proteins (Selby and Sancar, 1993). However, recent in vivo experiments have found that strand-specific repair does not occur in UV-irradiated mutL− and mutS− cells, suggesting that there might be a direct involvement of these proteins in transcription-repair coupling. 2I. Mellon, personal communication. Therefore, we made cell-free extracts from both mutL and mutS mutant cells and tested them for coupling activity in vitro. Strand-specific repair was observed with both mutant extracts (Fig. 7). Significantly, when the mutS− extract was supplemented with purified MutS protein the degree of strand-specific repair was unaffected (lanes 7 and 8). In contrast, supplementing the mutant extracts with TRCF enhanced the strand-specific repair of the CFE (lanes 4 and 9) as is commonly observed with wild-type extracts (Selby et al.(1991); see also Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 9). Thus, our in vitro data indicate that MutL and MutS are not directly involved in transcription-repair coupling. Our work reveals that the TRCF is a protein with helicase motifs but no helicase activity under a variety of conditions. It is quite possible that many of the “motif helicases” actually do not have helicase activity but do interact with DNA and perhaps also cause local melting and kinking which are important for the ultimate functions of the protein. The TRCF is the only known protein in E. coli other than rho that is able to dissociate a ternary RNA Pol complex. However, the results presented here show that the two proteins function similarly in only one aspect, dissociating ternary complexes stalled at a protein “road block” to transcription. In other aspects of their functions the proteins differ sharply. TRCF does not dissociate ternary complexes formed at rho-dependent terminators when present at physiological concentrations. Furthermore, rho is an RNA binding protein with a strong RNA-DNA helicase activity. In contrast the TRCF has no measurable affinity to RNA and no helicase activity on RNA-DNA duplexes in a variety of structures. Our data also reveals that the TRCF brings about its coupling function by increasing the rate of delivery of UvrB to the damage region and that this effect can be overcome by increasing UvrA and UvrB but not UvrC concentrations, suggesting that the preferential repair of the transcribed strand is accomplished by preferential delivery of UvrB to the damage site with the aid of TRCF. The precise mechanism of TRCF aided delivery, however, is still not known, although it appears that the predicted reaction intermediates are quite transient when wild-type TRCF and conventional reaction conditions are used. Notably, a stable TRCF-stalled elongation complex was observed only when t-TRCF was used, TRCF bound stably to DNA only when ATP hydrolysis was inhibited, and binding of TRCF to the UvrA2•UvrB1 damage recognition complex facilitates dissociation of UvrA and UvrB. We have found that coupling occurs only when the lesion is approximately 15 nt downstream from the transcriptional start site and approximately 90 nt from the 5′ terminus of the template strand. These findings lead us to conclude that the TRCF can couple repair to transcription only when RNA Pol is in the elongation mode and that the TRCF anchors itself downstream from the transcription stop site to carry out its coupling function. Finally since extracts from mutL− or mutS− cells are capable of strand-specific repair, we conclude that in vitro, TRCF is sufficient to stimulate nucleotide excision repair of lesions in the template strand that block RNA Pol.

Here, we have investigated the structural domains of the AP-1 complex necessary for ARF-mediated translocation of the adaptor complex onto Golgi membranes and the subsequent recruitment of clathrin onto the membrane. Controlled proteolysis of purified AP-1, derived from bovine adrenal coated vesicles, was used to generate AP-1 core fragments composed of the amino-terminal trunk regions of the β1 and γ subunits and associated μ1 and σ1 subunits, and lacking either the β1 subunit carboxyl-terminal appendage or both β1 and γ subunit appendages. On addition of these truncated fragments to AP-1-depleted adrenal cytosol, both types of core fragments were efficiently recruited onto Golgi membranes in the presence of GTPγS. Recruitment of both core fragments was inhibited by the fungal metabolite brefeldin A, indicative of an ARF-dependent process. Limited tryptic digestion of recruited, intact cytosolic AP-1 resulted in the quantitative release of the globular carboxyl-terminal appendage domains of the β1 and γ subunits. The adaptor core complex remained associated with the Golgi membranes. Recruitment of cytosolic clathrin onto the Golgi membranes was strictly dependent on the presence of intact AP-1. Tryptic removal of the β1 subunit appendage prevented subsequent clathrin recruitment. We conclude that the structural determinants required for the ARF-mediated binding of cytosolic AP-1 onto Golgi membranes are contained within the adaptor core, and that the carboxyl-terminal appendage domains of the β1 and γ subunits do not play any role in this process.

One type is restricted to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkAP-1Golgi-specific heterotetrameric adaptor complexAP-2plasma membrane-specific heterotetrameric adaptor complexARFADP-ribosylation factorBFAbrefeldin AGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). and Golgi-derived coated vesicles and termed AP-1. The second, localized to the plasma membrane and endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles, is termed AP-2. Adaptors are heterotetrameric complexes, composed of one related and one unique ∼100-kDa subunit, and two additional components, the ∼50-kDa μ and ∼20-kDa σ subunits. Thus, the Golgi AP-1 adaptor complex is composed of γ, β1, μ1, and σ1 subunits, and the related AP-2 is composed of α, β2, μ2, and σ2 subunits. The β1 and β2 subunits are very similar in structure(5Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.)

Biochem. 1994; 222: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), while the α and γ subunits are the most distantly related adaptor subunits(4Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 9Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy has revealed that the AP-2 adaptor has a large globular core domain and two exposed globular head or appendage domains 2The nomenclature that we have used to distinguish between the different domains and subunits of the AP-1 adaptor is as follows. The appendage refers to the globular carboxyl-terminal head domain and the hinge region of either the β1 or γ subunit. The hinge connects the appendage to the adaptor core, consisting of the 60-70-kDa amino-terminal trunks of both the β1 and γ subunits and the intact μ1 and σ1 subunits. (10Heuser J.E. Keen J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Controlled proteolysis of both AP-1 and AP-2 (11Zaremba S. Keen J.H. J. Cell.

Adaptors are believed to facilitate clathrin-coated vesicle formation by combining a clathrin binding domain and a membrane association domain within an oligomeric protein complex. When it became apparent that the β1 and β2 subunits were highly related, it was suggested that these subunits might contain a common domain capable of binding to clathrin(5Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Indeed, the purified β2 subunit interacts directly with preformed clathrin cages(15Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20089-20093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, more recently, it has been shown that recombinant β-type subunits alone can induce clathrin polymerization(16Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Further attempts to define the clathrin binding site more precisely indicated that proteolytically generated cores can bind to preformed clathrin cages(12Keen J.H. Beck K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting that the clathrin binding site is located in the amino-terminal trunk domain. However, in buffer conditions that prevent adaptor self-association, tryptic removal of the β subunit appendage results in the release of both appendage and core fragments from clathrin-coated vesicles(14Schröder S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7910-7918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that both the trunk and appendage domains of the β-type subunits are required for high affinity clathrin binding(14Schröder S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7910-7918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Before clathrin binding and polymerization can occur, however, the adaptors must associate stably with the appropriate intracellular membrane compartment. According to the simplest model for the interaction of adaptors with membranes(1Brodsky F.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Keen J.H. Annu. Rev.

J. 1989; 8: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), it was assumed that they attach directly to the cytoplasmic portions of selected receptors. Indeed, there is evidence that adaptors can interact directly, albeit weakly, with the cytoplasmic regions of certain proteins sorted into clathrin-coated vesicles(17Pearse B.M.F. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 1988; 7: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 18Glickman J.N. Conibear E. Pearse B.M.F. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.)

Chem. 1993; 268: 12537-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This simple model, while attractive, failed to explain the restricted localization of AP-1 within the cell and why AP-1 does not bind to cytoplasmically oriented trafficking motifs in receptors transiting through other intracellular compartments(2Morris S.A. Ahle S. Ungewickell E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Keen J.H. Annu. Rev.

Furthermore, the dramatic effect of brefeldin A (BFA) on the intracellular localization of AP-1 also suggested that clathrin coat formation is highly regulated (23Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 24Wong D.H. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, the recruitment of cytosolic AP-1 onto purified Golgi membranes was reconstituted in vitro(25Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Adaptor binding was found to be dependent on GTP and antagonized by BFA. ARF, a small GTP-binding protein, was identified as the GTP-requiring component(25Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Coatomer-coated vesicle formation also proceeds by the initial recruitment of ARF(27Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 28Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J.M. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12083-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), explaining the sensitivity of both clathrin- and coatomer-coated vesicle formation to BFA. However, since no clear ARF specificity has yet been discerned(25Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), we proposed that ARF may be required to ensure the selective interaction of AP-1 with a specific docking protein in the context of the TGN membrane. While our model overcomes the limitations of the direct association model, the structural determinants on the AP-1 complex that are recognized by the putative docking protein remain to be identified. The role of the α and γ subunit appendages has been probed using a chimera-based approach(29Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Swapping the α and γ subunit head and/or hinge regions did not appear to affect either the assembly or targeting of the AP-1 or AP-2 chimeric complexes. Here, we have taken a different approach to directly assess the structural features of the AP-1 heterotetramer required for Golgi membrane association and subsequent clathrin recruitment. Defined tryptic fragments were produced by controlled proteolysis(8Ungewickell E. Plessmann E. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Schröder S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7910-7918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this has enabled us to follow the ARF-dependent recruitment of the different fragments onto Golgi membranes. We have found the translocation of the AP-1 core complex to be indistinguishable from intact AP-1. This precludes the globular carboxyl terminus and hinge regions from controlling this process. In contrast, clathrin binding to Golgi membranes was found to be strictly dependent on an intact β1 subunit. [α-32P]GTP (>3,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from ICN. GTPγS was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Aprotinin, ATP, benzamidine, BFA, dithiothreitol, leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, Triton X-100, and Tween 20 were from Sigma. BFA was stored as a 5 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol at −20°C. Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from SASCO, and the frozen bovine adrenal glands were obtained from PelFreez. BA 83 nitrocellulose membranes were obtained from Schleicher and Schuell, and Sepharose 4B, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, and the Mr markers for electrophoresis were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was purchased either from Cooper Biomedical or Worthington. The ECL reagents for chemiluminescent detection were obtained from Amersham. All other reagents were the highest grade available. The anti-β subunit antibody mAb 100/1(5Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.)

Chem. 1986; 261: 10945-10951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared and used as described previously(26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Antiserum AE/1 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal dodecapeptide of the murine γ subunit of AP-1(9Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Peptide conjugation, immunization, and screening was as detailed previously(33Traub L.M. Sagi-Eisenberg R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24642-24649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AE/1 was further affinity-purified from immune serum on a column of the peptide (AEVNNFPPQSWQ) coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. Peptide-specific antibodies were eluted with 100 mM glycine HCl, pH 2.5, followed by 100 mM triethylamine, pH 11.5(34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Laboratory Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Antiserum GD/1 was similarly raised against a dodecapeptide (GDLLNLDLGPPV), a conserved sequence in the hinge region of all known mammalian β-type subunits. Affinity-purified GD/1 was prepared similarly on a peptide-Sepharose 4B column. The rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from Dakopatts. Rat liver Golgi membranes and cytosol were prepared as described previously(26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For the preparation of bovine adrenal cytosol, frozen adrenal glands were rapidly thawed at 37°C in a homogenization buffer of 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA supplemented with 5 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Once thawed, the tissue was immediately transferred to homogenization buffer on ice, finely minced, and homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer containing approximately 2 volumes of homogenization buffer with 5 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 trypsin inhibitory unit/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. This and all subsequent procedures were performed at 0-4°C. The crude homogenate was centrifuged sequentially at 3,000 × g for 10 min, 10,000 × g for 20 min, and 100,000 × g for 60 min to yield a high speed cytosolic supernatant fraction. The cytosol was stored in aliquots at −80°C after rapid freezing in dry ice. Adrenal or rat liver cytosol was depleted of clathrin by gel filtration on Sepharose 4B. 50-60 ml of cytosol was rapidly thawed, centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min to remove aggregated material, and loaded at 1 ml/min onto a Sepharose 4B column (5.0 × 70 cm) equilibrated in 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 125 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, and 0.05% sodium azide. Fractions of 20 ml were collected, and the elution positions of clathrin and AP-1 and AP-2 adaptors was determined on immunoblots using mAb TD.1 and mAb 100/1. The clathrin triskelia eluted well ahead of the adaptors, and fractions after the clathrin peak were pooled, concentrated by precipitation with 60% ammonium sulfate, and dialyzed against 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 125 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (Buffer C). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the clathrin-depleted cytosol was aliquotted, quick frozen in dry ice, and stored at −80°C. The clathrin-containing fractions were pooled separately and concentrated approximately 10-fold by ultrafiltration using an Amicon YM 30 filter. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the clathrin-enriched fraction was stored at 4°C. Endogenous AP-1 was removed from the clathrin-depleted adrenal cytosol by immunodepletion(26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytosol was passed over an immobilized mAb 100/3 column equilibrated in buffer C on ice, and the loading effluent was reapplied to the column several times, before similar passages over a second mAb 100/3 column equilibrated in buffer C on ice. The resulting AP-1-depleted cytosol was analyzed on immunoblots using affinity-purified AE/1, and the extent of depletion was more than 95%. Clathrin-coated vesicles and coated vesicle-derived AP-1 were purified from frozen bovine adrenal glands as described in detail previously(8Ungewickell E. Plessmann E. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated using either the Coomassie Blue method (35Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard or, for the purified AP-1 preparations, by A280, using an E1cm1% value of 6.0(14Schröder S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7910-7918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was a modification of our binding assay utilizing rat liver cytosol(26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For most assays, bovine adrenal cytosol replaced the rat cytosol, and Golgi membranes and GTPγS were added to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 100 μM, respectively. Reactions were terminated by chilling on ice followed by centrifugation, and the Golgi membrane-containing pellets were prepared for immunoblotting as described(26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Routinely, pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of 1 × SDS sample buffer, and 10 μl was loaded per lane. When aliquots of the assay supernatant were also examined, an aliquot corresponding to 1/80 of each supernatant was loaded. For the two-stage clathrin binding assay, the first stage incubation contained clathrin-depleted rat liver cytosol, Golgi membranes, and GTPγS. Membranes were recovered by centrifugation and digested with trypsin as described below. The trypsinized membranes were then added to a second stage incubation containing 0.1 mg/ml clathrin-enriched Sepharose 4B pool and 20 μg/ml BFA in buffer C. After incubation at 37°C for 15 min, the tubes were returned to ice, and the pellets were prepared for analysis as outlined above. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown at 37°C on round polylysine-coated 1.2-cm glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For permeabilization, the cells were washed first in phosphate-buffered saline, then twice in 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mM potassium acetate, 2.5 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mg/ml glucose (buffer E) and then frozen on dry ice. The cells were thawed, and the endogenous cytosol was removed by dipping the coverslip into a beaker of buffer E 10 times at room temperature. Gel-filtered whole rat liver cytosol, at a concentration of ∼5 mg/ml in buffer D, was supplemented with 100 μM GTPγS and coated vesicle-derived adrenal AP-1 or proteolytic fragments to give a final adaptor concentration of 50-70 μg/ml. After addition of the cytosol, the cells were warmed to 37°C for 15 min and then washed by dipping the coverslip into a beaker of buffer E 10 times. The cells were then fixed for 5 min at room temperature with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and double-labeled with R461 and mAb 100/3 as described in detail previously(5Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Tryptic digestion of Golgi membranes was carried out in buffer C at a membrane concentration of 1 mg/ml. Triton X-100 and trypsin were added on ice as indicated in the figures, and digestion was performed at 37°C for 10 min, followed by chilling and addition of excess soybean trypsin inhibitor. For some experiments, the membranes were then collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant fractions were concentrated by precipitation with methanol/chloroform(36Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 141-143Crossref Scopus (3191) Google Scholar), and both supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Proteolysis of the purified adrenal AP-1 was performed in 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 125 mM potassium acetate for 1 h at 30°C using a protein/trypsin ratio of 1:30 for the quantitative removal of the β1 subunit appendage. The reaction was stopped by adding excess soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the sample was used for the binding studies without further purification. For the preparation of appendageless AP-1 cores, the digestion was carried out at 30°C using a trypsin to substrate ratio of 1:20. Residual AP-1 containing an intact γ subunit, which we have found difficult to cleave quantitatively with trypsin(14Schröder S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7910-7918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was removed by immunoadsorption on a mAb 100/3 column. The unbound material was concentrated to approximately 0.5-1.0 mg/ml in a Centricon 30 before use in the binding assays. The polypeptide composition of all the fragments used in this study was verified on Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously(26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes at 110 V for 70 min in a buffer of 15.6 mM Tris, 120 mM glycine, pH ∼8.3, equilibrated to 4°C. Following transfer, the membranes were blocked and probed with antibodies as described previously(26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). GTP-binding proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose were preincubated for 60 min at room temperature in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.3% Tween 20 (buffer D), supplemented with 200 μM ATP and 2 μCi/ml [α-32P]GTP, and then incubated for an additional 60 min, followed by four washes in buffer D. The GTP-binding proteins were visualized by autoradiography at −80°C using an intensifying screen. The goal of this study was to identify the structural regions of the heterotetrameric AP-1 adaptor complex which are involved in the ARF-dependent recruitment onto Golgi membranes and the subsequent recruitment of cytosolic clathrin. To distinguish between the endogenous rat liver Golgi-associated AP-1 and exogenously added cytosolic AP-1, using a species-specific mAb directed against the γ subunit, we had to modify our existing AP-1 binding assay by substituting bovine adrenal gland cytosol for rat liver cytosol. To limit our analysis to the initial events in clathrin-coated vesicle assembly, clathrin-depleted adrenal cytosol (26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) has been used for several of the experiments described below. Recruitment of AP-1 onto Golgi membranes is preceded by the recruitment of ARF(25Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E.

Several other uncharacterized low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins were also recruited onto the Golgi membrane. The accumulation of ARF was accompanied by recruitment of cytosolic AP-1 onto the Golgi membrane fraction. When recruitment was followed after pretreatment with BFA, decreased levels of both ARF and AP-1 were observed in the membranes, and the extent of recruitment varied according to the time of addition of BFA (Fig. 1, lanes d-g). These results are analogous to those obtained using rat liver cytosol (26Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993;"
https://openalex.org/W2031361744,"Two rpoN-linked ΔTn10-kan insertions suppress the conditionally lethal erats allele. One truncates rpoN while the second disrupts another gene (ptsN) in the rpoN operon and does not affect classical nitrogen regulation. Neither alter expression of era indicating that suppression is post-translational. Plasmid clones of ptsN prevent suppression by either disruption mutation indicating that this gene is important for lethality caused by erats. rpoN and six neighboring genes were sequenced and compared with sequences in the database. Two of these genes encode proteins homologous to Enzyme IIAFru and HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. We designate these proteins IIANtr (ptsN) and NPr (npr). Purified IIANtr and NPr exchange phosphate appropriately with Enzyme I, HPr, and Enzyme IIA proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. Several sugars and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates inhibited growth of the ptsN disruption mutant on medium containing an amino acid or nucleoside base as a combined source of nitrogen, carbon, and energy. This growth inhibition was relieved by supplying the ptsN gene or ammonium salts but was not aleviated by altering levels of exogenously supplied cAMP. These results support our previous proposal of a novel mechanism linking carbon and nitrogen assimilation and relates IIANtr to the unknown process regulated by the essential GTPase Era."

Calnexin is a type I membrane protein whose lumenal domain shares considerable sequence similarity with calreticulin, including three copies of the characteristic KPEDWD motif (for reviews see Refs. 1, 2). Calnexin is capable of binding Ca2+ and it was proposed to be involved in the retention of soluble ER proteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner(3Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.J. Doherty II, J.J.

Initial reports have identified calnexin as a protein involved in the assembly of class I histocompatibility molecules (p88; 4) and the T-cell receptor (IP90; 5, 6) providing an indication of its cellular function. Further studies have demonstrated that calnexin is a major molecular chaperone interacting with numerous newly synthesized glycoproteins transiting through the ER(7Ahluwalia N. Bergeron J.J.M.

It has been proposed that calnexin is part of the ER quality control machinery, binding folding intermediates through their oligosaccharide moieties until these substrates achieve proper folding or until misfolded proteins are degraded(1Bergeron J.J.M.

The isolation and sequencing of cDNA and genomic clones of mammalian, Xenopus laevis, plant, and helminth species, have revealed that the general structural organization of calnexin has been conserved through evolution(1Bergeron J.J.M.

However, Saccharomyces cerevisiae appears to be an exception, as calnexin from this yeast contains a single copy of the KPEDWD repeat and does not posses a cytosolic domain(15De Virgilio C. Burckert N. Neuhaus J.M. Boller T. Wiemken A. Yeast. 1993; 9: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cytosolic, C-terminal domain of mammalian calnexin is phosphorylated at serine residues by casein kinase II. It was proposed that phosphorylation of calnexin could be involved in modulation of its function(3Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.J. Doherty II, J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y.

Calreticulin is a major calcium-binding, soluble intraluminal protein (reviewed in (16Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Complementary DNAs encoding calreticulin have been cloned from numerous organisms (16-23, and references therein). The encoded polypeptides show a remarkable degree of conservation, especially in the central portion, or P-domain, which is relatively rich in prolines and contains three KPEDWD repeats(16Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 24Smith M.J. Koch G.L.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). An ever growing body of intriguing observations indicates calreticulin may be involved in several cellular processes(25Burns K. Atkinson E.A. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 152-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Dedhar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 269-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For instance, Dedhar and collaborators (27Rojiani M.V. Finlay B.B. Gray V. Dedhar S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9859-9865Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) presented evidence that calreticulin binds to the highly conserved peptide KXGFFKR present in the cytoplasmic domain α-subunit of integrin receptors, and they have further shown that this interaction occurs also in vivo(28Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the almost identical peptide KXFFKR is found in the DNA-binding domain of all steroid receptors led to the demonstration that calreticulin interacts in vitro with the glucocorticoid receptor and the androgen receptor (29Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 30Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M.

Moreover, it was shown that overexpression of calreticulin can inhibit the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid, the androgen and the retinoic receptors, as well as retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation(29Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 30Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M.

To better understand the cellular functions of the calreticulin/calnexin family of proteins, we set out to clone the genes encoding these proteins in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. As its distant relative the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, S. pombe is suitable for analysis by classical and reverse genetic approaches(31Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar, 32Russel P. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the fission yeast. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 243-271Crossref Google Scholar). However, in several molecular, functional and morphological aspects, S. pombe appears more similar to higher eukaryotes than the budding yeast. For instance, S. pombe genes are more homologous to those of higher eukaryotes(31Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar, 32Russel P. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the fission yeast. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 243-271Crossref Google Scholar), the cell-cycle control and cell division are akin to those of higher eukaryotes, and S. pombe has well defined ER and Golgi structures which are easily identifiable by EM(33Pidoux A.L. Armstrong J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Armstrong J. Craighead M.W. Watson R. Ponnambalam S. Bowden S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, glycoproteins of the fission yeast acquire terminal galactose residues like higher eukaryotes do(35Chappell T.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2693-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Moreno S. Ruiz T. Sanchez Y. Villanueva J.R. Rodriguez L. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 14: 370-374Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These features make S. pombe an ideal model organism for the study of gene function and cellular processes of higher eukaryotes. In this study, we describe the isolation of the gene encoding the S. pombe calnexin homologue. The S. pombe calnexin species possesses the characteristic type I topology, and its amino acid sequence is more closely related to its plant and mammalian counterparts than to the S. cerevisiae homologue. Unlike the species from higher eukaryotes, the fission yeast calnexin contains a site that can be glycosylated in an in vitro translation-processing system. We demonstrate that disruption of the S. pombe calnexin gene is lethal and that its expression is induced by several types of stress. Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue MRF′ was used for all cloning procedures and screening of libraries constructed in the λZAP Express vector (Stratagene). E. coli strain XLOLR (Stratagene) was used for plating excised phagemids. Strain NM514 (Hfl+) was used in screening procedures involving λgt10 (Stratagene). S. pombe strains employed were SP629 (h+/h−ade6-M216/ade6-M210 ura4-D18/ura4-D18 leu1-32/leu1-32) obtained from Dr. David Beach and SP556 (h+ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1-32) obtained from Dr. Paul Nurse. YE and minimal medium (MM) were prepared as described(31Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). Extremely low nitrogen medium (ELN; same composition as MM, except that NH4Cl was at 50 mg/liter) 2A. M. Carr, personal communication. was used for the sporulation of diploids. Genetical procedures were performed as described previously (31Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). Standard DNA manipulations were carried out as described(37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). S. pombe genomic DNA was prepared as described(31Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). Two S. pombe genomic libraries were constructed. λSP1 was constructed by ligating EcoRI-digested, size-selected (2.5-3.5 kb), genomic DNA into EcoRI-digested λgt10 arms (Stratagene). λSP2 was constructed by ligating partially Sau3A-digested, size-selected (5-7 kb) genomic DNA into BamHI-digested λZAP Express arms (Stratagene). The S. pombe cDNA library, constructed in λZAPII vector (Stratagene), was a gift from Dr. David Beach. Hybridization conditions were as described before(37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Where noted, reduced stringency of washing condition were used (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 2 × 15 min at room temperature and 2 × 15 min at 60°C). Logarithmically growing cells of SP556 (50 ml, minimal medium) were subjected to different treatments. Control cells were incubated at 30°C for 2 h. For heat shock, cell cultures were shifted from 30 to 39°C for 5, 10, 30, or 60 min. Alternatively, cells were grown at 30°C in the presence of either 10 μg/ml tunicamycin, 10 μM A23187, or 15 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). For other treatments, cells were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in minimal medium minus glucose, supplemented with 3% glycerol and 2% lactic acid, in the presence or absence of 2-deoxyglucose (10 mM), and incubation continued for a further 2 h. At the end of incubation, cells were placed on ice, pelleted, and total RNA was prepared as described (31Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). RNA samples (2.5 μg) were analyzed by Northern blot as described previously(38Rokeach L.A. Jannatipour M. Haselby J.A. Hoch S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5024-5030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gel was stained with ethidium bromide to verify that equivalent amounts of RNA were loaded. Primer extensions were performed using a 32P end-radiolabeled oligonucleotide (P1CARC2: 5′-CGAACATATAAAGAGCAC-3′) and 50 μg of total RNA using “S1 hybridization solution” (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar) at 30°C overnight. Plasmid pSPCA3080, containing a cDNA encoding the complete S. pombe calnexin, was linearized with BamHI and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (United States Biochemical Corp.). Shorter transcripts were transcribed using pSPCA3080 linearized at unique internal sites (Fig. 4). The resulting RNAs (1 μg) were translated in vitro using [35S]methionine in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, in the presence or absence of rough microsomes from dog pancreas (Promega), following manufacturer's recommendations. Pepstatin, 10 μM, was added during translation to minimize proteolysis. The translation products were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar) followed by fluorography (Amplify, Amersham). To assess translocation of in vitro synthesized proteins across, or their insertion into, the canine rough microsomes, protease protection assays were performed. In vitro translation samples (1.25 μl) were incubated in 15 μl (final volume) of 25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 250 mM sucrose, for 30 min, at 0°C. Where indicated, trypsin and Triton X-100 were added to 0.1 mg/ml and 0.2%, respectively. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar) followed by immediate boiling for 5 min. For treatment with endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim), the translation reactions (5 μl) were adjusted to 1% SDS and 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0, in a final volume of 10 μl, boiled for 3 min, and incubated for 5 h at 37°C in the presence of 2 milliunits of endoglycosidase H. Carbonate treatments were performed essentially as described previously(41Brown D.J. Hogue B.G. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3824-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate the construction of S. pombe disrupted genes, the 1.7-kb HindIII fragment encoding ura4 from pURA4 3F. Lacroute, unpublished results. was first cloned into pBluescript (Startagene), resulting in plasmid pSPUR3075. Using available restriction sites on pSPUR3075 (HincII and EcoRI), the ura4 gene was subcloned into the EcoRV-EcoRI sites (coordinates 739-1072, see Fig. 2) of the plasmid pSPCA3059 which contains the 1.8-kb ClaI-BglII genomic fragment of cnx1 (coordinates 455-1780, see Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:) yielding plasmid pSPCA3094. This step resulted in the deletion of 333 bp of the cnx1 coding sequence. A linear fragment from plasmid pSPCA3094, carrying the ura4-interrupted cnx1 sequences, was isolated and transformed into a sporulation-deficient isolate of the diploid strain SP629. Genomic DNA from parental SP629 and Ura+ transformants was analyzed by digestion with EcoRI/XbaI and EcoRI/BgllI followed by Southern blot using as probe a ClaI-EcoRI fragment (617 bp, coordinates 455-1072; see Fig. 2) which encompasses both the deleted region (333 bp) and 285 bp just 5′ to the deleted region (Fig. 6). A sporulation-proficient colony of the resulting heterozygous calnexin-disrupted strain (SP5) was identified by the iodine vapor method (31Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar) and sporulated on ELN. The mixture of asci and vegetative cells was treated in 1 ml of 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 10 μl of β-glucuronidase (Sigma) at room temperature, overnight. Digestion was examined microscopically and approximately 200 spores were washed and germinated onto media with or without uracil to determine the genotype of the progeny.Figure 6:Gene disruption of S. pombe cnx1. A 333 bp stretch was deleted form the cnx1 gene and replaced with the ura4 marker gene. A linear fragment containing the ura4 interrupted cnx1 sequences was transformed into the diploid SP629 in order to disrupt, by homologous recombination, one of the copies of the cnx1 gene. Ura+ transformant strains were analyzed by Southern blotting; clone SP5 had the expected genotype. A, Southern blot of genomic DNA digested with EcoRI-XbaI and EcoRI-BglII and probed with an EcoRI-ClaI fragment (cnx1 coordinates 455-1072). DNA from wild type strain SP629 contains two hybridizing fragments of 0.5 and 2.6 kb upon digestion with EcoRI-XbaI (lane 1) and one hybridizing fragment of 1.3 kb upon digestion with EcoRI-BglII (lane 3). Strain SP5 contains an additional hybridizing band of 1.9 kb upon digestion with EcoRI-XbaI (lane 2) and an additional hybridizing band of 2.7 kb upon digestion with EcoRI-BglII (lane 4), indicating homologous integration and disruption of one copy of the cnx1 gene. B, random spore analysis of the diploid strain SP5 containing one copy of cnx1 disrupted by ura4. Approximately 200 spores were counted, washed, and plated on non selective media. Colonies were picked and examined for growth in the presence (B1) and absence (B2) of uracil. None of the spores examined grew in the absence of uracil indicating that cnx1 is an essential gene. Only one of the plates examined is shown here. The diploid SP5 strain was used in the lower right of the plate as control. C, physical map of the wild type and disrupted copies of cnx1 in SP5.

These efforts were unfruitful, and therefore a different approach was taken. We reasoned that due to the previously observed sequence similarity between S. pombe and mammalian genes (31Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar, 32Russel P. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of the fission yeast. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 243-271Crossref Google Scholar) it would be possible to use human calreticulin cDNA fragments to probe S. pombe genomic DNA by hybridization. Accordingly, PCR was used to generate three probes using a cDNA encoding human calreticulin as template(17Rokeach L.A. Haselby J.A. Meilof J.F. Smeenk R.J.T. Unnasch T.R. Greene B.M. Hoch S.O. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3031-3039PubMed Google Scholar). Two DNA probes, designated 126 and 2-18, were created to match highly conserved regions common to both calreticulin and calnexin (see Fig. 3). Whereas a third probe, designated 2-20, corresponded to the acidic, C-terminal domain of calreticulin (last 74 residues; see Fig. 3). These probes were used in Southern blot analysis of S. pombe genomic DNA, under reduced stringency conditions (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 3). Two of the probes, 126 and 2-18, consistently yielded a single common band with each restriction digest (3.2 kb EcoRI, 8.5 kb XbaI, and 5.3 kb HindIII; see Fig. 1 A, panels 1 and 2), whereas probe 2-20 yielded a rather complex hybridization pattern (see Fig. 1A, panel 3). Therefore, we chose to clone the 3.2-kb EcoRI fragment (P1, Fig. 1B) recognized by probes 126 and 2-18. In order to meet this aim, a size-selected library was constructed (designated λSP1) and screened with the 126 probe. Sequencing of several positive clones, revealed that the P1 insert encoded an open reading frame incomplete at its 3′ end and with the potential of encoding a protein with extensive similarity to both calnexin and calreticulin. Moreover, a 503-bp, EcoRI-XbaI derived from P1 was used in Southern analysis to confirm the authenticity of the clone. This fragment yielded the same pattern as with probes 126 and 2-18 except that an additional band was present when genomic DNA was digested with HindIII or XbaI (see Fig. 1, panels 4 and 5). The P1 fragment was used to screen genomic and cDNA libraries constructed in λZAP Express (λSP2) and λZAPII, respectively. One group of positive clones, represented by insert P6 (see Fig. 1B), contained an uninterrupted ORF of 1.68 kb in length (see cDNA sequence indicated in Fig. 2). The sequences contained in the P6 clone extended 1066 nucleotides upstream from the predicted initiation codon and therefore were likely to contain the entire promoter and regulatory elements of this gene (see below and Fig. 2). Furthermore, the P6 clone contained, following two termination codons, 550 nucleotides of the 3′-untranslated sequences comprising three putative polyadenylation signals (42; see Fig. 2). The ORF in clone P6 contains 560 triplets capable of encoding a 63.4-kDa polypeptide with a predicted pI of 4.25. At its N terminus, the encoded polypeptide displays a putative signal sequence with a probable cleavage site between residues 22 and 23(43Watson M.E.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5145-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The predicted polypeptide shares significant identity with the published sequences of calnexin from human (39.4%; (7Ahluwalia N. Bergeron J.J.M. Wada I. Degen E. Williams D.B. J. Biol.

Haselby J.A. Meilof J.F. Smeenk R.J.T. Unnasch T.R. Greene B.M. Hoch S.O. J.

In contrast, the predicted polypeptide displays, close to its C-terminal end, a relatively hydrophobic stretch of 23 residues with the potential to span a membrane, a diagnostic feature of calnexin, a type I protein. Therefore, we conclude that this ORF encodes the S. pombe calnexin homologue. Consistent with the nomenclature used for the A. thaliana species, we designated this S. pombe gene cnx1 and its product Cnx1p. Another set of positive clones contained an ORF with similar sequence at the nucleotide level (approximately 45%; see Fig. 1) with that of cnx1, however, encoding a protein unrelated to either calreticulin or calnexin (data not shown).Figure 1:Cloning of S. pombe cnx1.A, S. pombe genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI, XbaI, and HindIII (lanes E, X, and H, respectively) and subject to Southern analysis under conditions of reduced stringency of hybridization as described under “Materials and Methods.” Probes used were as follows: panel 1, 126 bp; panel 2, 2-18; panel 3, 2-20; panels 4 and 5, 503-bp EcoRI-XbaI fragment from P1 clone (see below).

The S. pombe calnexin contains three copies of these repeats as well as one less conserved copy, whereas the S. cerevisiae species contains only one copy of the KPEDWD repeat (see Fig. 3). Unlike its animal and plant counterparts, Cnx1p does not contain 2 basic residues at position −3 and −4 (or −5) form its C terminus, which constitutes a motif found in membrane proteins retained in the ER; however, it contains a lysine at position −4(45Jackson M.R.

A computer search for putative modifications revealed several potential sites for phosphorylation by casein kinase II (19-SLAD-23, 26-SEQE-29, 77-TVEE-80, 144-THGE-147, 409-SIED-412, 433-SKQE-436, and 481-TIIE-484) and protein kinase C (51-SER-53, 184-SEK-186, 540-TEK-542, and 555-TAK-557). Another feature of the amino acid sequence is the presence of a site for potential N-linked glycosylation at position 418-NETF-421 (see below and Fig. 2). In order to assess whether this potential site for N-glycosylation at position 418 is actually functional, a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation-processing system was used. To generate full-length and truncated versions of Cnx1p, synthetic cnx1 mRNAs of different lengths were translated in this system in the presence of [35S]methionine. Although the predicted molecular mass of 63.4 kDa, translation of the full-length synthetic cnx1 mRNA, in the absence of microsomes, yielded a product that moved on SDS-PAGE with apparent molecular mass of approximately 90 kDa.

https://openalex.org/W2008554680,"A gel fidelity assay, previously used in the analysis of DNA polymerases having no associated 3' to 5' exonuclease activity, has been generalized for use with polymerases that contain exonucleolytic proofreading. The main purpose of this study was the development of a general analysis, using a standard Markov model, to convert experimentally observed DNA primer gel bands arising from insertion and proofreading of and deoxyribonucleotides, into nucleotide incorporation velocities and, most importantly, fidelities. The model has been applied primarily to an analysis of polymerase kinetics and fidelity in the presence of a next correct dNTP, but the model can be conveniently modified to investigate other experimental designs. In the presence of dNTP, direct competition occurs between excision or extension of a mismatch. At concentrations of dNTP sufficient to suppress the gel band intensity at the mismatch target site, nucleotide incorporation and misincorporation rates can be obtained from the ratios of gel band intensities 3' (downstream) and 5' (upstream) to the target site, measured as a function dNTP concentration for wrong and right dNTP substrates. The polymerase misincorporation efficiency, in the presence of proofreading, is given by the ratio of to incorporation efficiencies, Vmax/Km, obtained from the gel band ratios. The bacteriophage T4 polymerase with a highly active 3'-exonuclease activity was used to illustrate the assay. Nucleotide misincorporation efficiencies measured at several template sites were dCMP.A approximately equal to 10(-6), dGMP.A approximately equal to 10(-5), dTMP.T approximately equal to 2 x 10(-4), and dAMP.A < 10(-7). Proofreading of the dGMP.A mispair was suppressed by about 3-fold in the presence of high concentrations of next correct rescue dNTP causing a concomitant reduction in the fidelity of dGMP.A to about 3 x 10(-5)."

The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 684 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 75,109 daltons and shows a high overall identity (58%) with that of phenethylamine oxidase derived from the same bacterial strain. Although the sequence similarities are rather low when compared with copper amine oxidases from other organisms, the consensus Asn-Tyr-Asp/Glu sequence, in which the middle Tyr is the precursor to the quinone cofactor (the quinone of 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine, topa) covalently bound to this class of enzymes, is also conserved in the histamine oxidase sequence.To identify the quinone cofactor, an overexpression plasmid has been constructed for the recombinant histamine oxidase. The inactive enzyme purified from the transformed Escherichia coli cells grown in a copper-depleted medium gained maximal activity upon stoichiometric binding of cupric ions. Concomitantly with the enzyme activation by copper, a brownish pink compound was generated in the enzyme, which was identified as the quinone of topa by absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopies of the p-nitrophenylhydrazine-derivatized enzyme and found at the position corresponding to the precursor Tyr (Tyr-402). Therefore, the copper-dependent autoxidation of a specific tyrosyl residue operates on the formation of the topa quinone cofactor in this enzyme, as recently demonstrated with the precursor form of phenethylamine oxidase (Matsuzaki, R., Fukui, T., Sato, H., Ozaki, Y., and Tanizawa, K.(1994) FEBS Lett. 351, 360-364).

https://openalex.org/W1994468043,"We have recently identified a new member of the Ras/GTPase superfamily termed Rad which has unique sequence features and is overexpressed in the skeletal muscle of humans with type II diabetes (Reynet, C., and Kahn, C. R.(1993) Science, 262, 1441-1444). When expressed in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, Rad bound [α-32P]GTP quickly and saturably. Binding was specific for guanine nucleotides and displayed unique magnesium dependence such that both GTP and GDP binding were optimal at relatively high Mg2+ concentrations (1-10 mM). Rad had low intrinsic GTPase activity which was greatly enhanced by a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity present in various tissues and cell lines. Several known GAPs had no stimulatory effect toward Rad. Conversion of Ser to Asn at position 66 in Rad (equivalent to position 12 in Ras) resulted in a total loss of GTP binding. Mutation of Pro61 (equivalent to Gly12 in Ras) or Gln109 (equivalent to Gln61 in Ras) had no effect on Rad GTPase activity, whereas creation of a double mutation at these positions resulted in exceptionally high intrinsic GTPase activity. In vitro, Rad was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK). Phosphopeptide mapping indicated two PKA phosphorylation sites near the COOII terminus. Rad also co-precipitated a serine/threonine kinase activity from extracts of various tissues and cell lines which catalyzed phosphorylation on Rad but was not inhibited by PKA inhibitor. Thus, Rad is a GTP-binding protein and a GTPase which has some structure/function similarities to Ras, but displays unique features.

The Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins has been implicated in a wide spectrum of cellular functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation(1Downward J. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), intracellular vesicular trafficking(2Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Channing J.D. Balch W.E. J.

By screening cDNA subtraction libraries, our laboratory has identified a transcript encoding a novel member of the Ras superfamily(13Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This protein has unique sequence features compared to other Ras-like proteins and is overexpressed in skeletal muscle of humans with Type II diabetes as compared with non-diabetic and Type I diabetic humans. We termed this protein Rad for Ras-related protein associated with diabetes. Very recently, a second member of the Rad family, termed Gem, was identified by polymerase chain reaction display following activation of T-lymphocytes(14Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Rad and Gem have several unique structural features among the Ras/GTPase superfamily which might affect GTP binding or GTPase activity. Both Rad and Gem are longer than Ras due to NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions; both lack the CAAX box at the COOH terminus which may affect their ability to undergo posttranslational modifications, such as geranyl-geranylation or farnesylation(15Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar); and both contain a number of nonconserved sequence changes in regions G1, G2, and G3 which are known to be involved in GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis (see Fig. 1). 1Rad has 2 in-frame methionines which result in potential proteins of 269 and 308 amino acid residues. It is not known which of these is used in vivo. For the purpose of this study, the first amino acid residue of Rad is assigned to the second methionine (corresponding to the second in frame ATG) as was discussed previously(13Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Therefore, residues 61, 66, 108, and 109 in Rad align with residues 12, 17, 60, and 61 in Ras, respectively. All Ras-related proteins are GTPases. These GTPases cycle between a GTP-bound (presumably active) form and a GDP-bound (presumably inactive) form. This cycle is regulated by proteins that affect GDP dissociation, GTP association, or the rate of GTP hydrolysis(16Feig L.A. Science. 1993; 260: 767-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The former are represented by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors and guanine nucleotide exchange factors, the best characterized of which is the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila Son-of-Sevenless protein (mSos). The latter is exemplified by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs).2 Both guanine nucleotide exchange factor and GAP activity may be controlled in response to extracellular stimuli(17Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). The role of Rad in the signaling events is still unknown. However, both Rad and Gem have marked sequence differences from any known Ras-related proteins in the effector (G2) domain thought to bind GAP. In the present study we have expressed Rad protein, characterized its GTP binding and GTPase activity properties, and studied structure-function relationship by site-directed mutagenesis and the possible regulation by noncovalent and covalent modifications. Full-length rad starting at the second in frame ATG (from nucleotide 241 to 1050 in (13Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) was generated by the polymerase chain reaction using a plasmid containing a Rad cDNA, including untranslated regions as template. The resulting 1.2-kilobase pair DNA was subcloned into BamHI-EcoRI-digested pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into XL1-blue cells (Stratagene), and expression of GST-Rad was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The fusion protein was affinity-purified from the soluble fraction of cell extract with glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia)(18Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (433) Google Scholar). When Rad alone was needed, its GST fusion partner was cleaved off with thrombin(19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar). A transformer mutagenesis kit (Clontech) was used to generate various mutants of Rad. Briefly, synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing the mutated sequences were made and annealed to pGEX-2T-rad backbone along with a selection primer which switched a unique AatII site on the vector to a unique SacI site. The parental plasmids were linearized by extensive restriction selection and nascent mutagenic plasmids were transformed to a mismatch repair-deficient strain (BMH 71-18 mut S). The mutant plasmids were then transformed to XL1-blue cells for DNA sequencing and protein expression. L6 rat myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a water-saturated 10% CO2, air atmosphere at 37°C to near confluence. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into a sonication buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, and 10 μM aprotinin. Cells were sonicated with a probe sonicator (Branson) and the particulate fraction removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant (cytosol) was aliquoted and stored at −80°C after determination of protein concentration. For the preparation of tissue extracts, human skeletal muscle, and rat tissues were homogenized with a Polytron in the cold lysis buffer (sonication buffer plus 1.1% Triton X-100) and incubated at 4°C for 90 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min and the supernatant stored at −80°C. GTP binding to Rad was determined using a nitrocellulose filtration assay (13Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) or a GTP overlay assay(20Zimmermann P. Schnefel S. Zeuzem S. Profrock A. Haase W. Schulz I. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 263: G396-G406Google Scholar). GST-Rad (20 pmol) was incubated in an exchange buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing the indicated concentrations of MgCl2 and 1.7 μM [α-32P]GTP (3 μCi/sample; DuPont NEN) at 22°C with end-to-end rotation. When needed, EDTA was added, and the concentrations of free Mg2+ calculated(21Sunyer T. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15447-15451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At each time point, aliquots of 40 μl were withdrawn in duplicate and directly filtered through BA 85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) followed by washing with 12 ml of cold filtration buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM DTT) containing the same concentrations of MgCl2 as used in the binding assay. The radioactivity remaining on the filters was determined by scintillation counting. [3H]GDP (3 μCi/20 pmol of GST-Rad; DuPont NEN) binding was carried out as described by Hall and Self (22Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the reaction was carried out at 37°C for 30 min in the absence or presence of various concentrations of Mg2+, and the radioactivity retained on the nitrocellulose filters was determined as described above. To assess the specificity of GTP binding to Rad, the fusion protein (5 μg/lane) was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose paper (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were cut into strips, washed twice with overlay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, and 0.3% Tween 20), and incubated in the overlay buffer containing 1 μCi/strip of [α-32P]GTP in the absence or presence of various nucleotides at a concentration of 0.1 mM. Incubation was continued at room temperature for 60 min, after which the blots were washed twice for 10-min intervals with the same buffer supplemented with 20 mM MgCl2. The blots were air-dried and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Kodak). The amount of GTP was quantitated by scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics). GTPase activity was measured by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (23Park H.-O. Chant J. Herskowitz I. Nature. 1993; 365: 269Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) using a hydrolysis buffer as described previously(24Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). GST-Rad-Sepharose beads (1 μg of protein) were loaded with [α-32P]GTP (3 μCi) as described above at room temperature for 20 min. The beads were washed three times by microcentrifugation (with 30 μl of Sepharose 4B beads as carrier) with cold washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and once with cold hydrolysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The beads were resuspended in the hydrolysis buffer equilibrated to room temperature, and aliquots of 40 μl were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes containing 40 μl of buffer, different GAPs (p120GAP, NF1, and Rap-GAP were provided by Frank McCormick of Onynx; p190 and IQGAP1 were from Jeffery Settleman of Massachusetts General Hospital) or cell/tissue extracts and carrier beads. Hydrolysis was carried out at 22°C and quenched by the addition of 1 ml of cold washing buffer followed immediately by washing twice with the same buffer. The bound nucleotides were then eluted with 20 μl of elution buffer consisting of 1% SDS and 20 mM EDTA at 65°C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation. Equal amount of counts were loaded onto polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (EM Science), and nucleotides were resolved in 0.75 M K2PO4, pH 3.4. TLC plates were exposed to x-ray film and the relative amounts of GTP and GDP quantitated by scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics). Tissue or cell extracts (200 μg/assay) obtained as described above were precleared with 500 μg of GST-Sepharose beads five times by incubation at 4°C for periods of 30 min. The precleared extract was then incubated with GST-Rad-Sepharose beads (20 μg/assay) in the presence of 0.1 mM GTPγS or GDPβS at 4°C for 90 min followed by washing five times with the extraction buffer containing 0.1 mM GTP or GDP. To assess phosphorylation, the beads were resuspended in the same buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/assay; DuPont NEN) and incubated at 30°C for 15 min. The beads were then washed twice, and phospho-Rad was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained, destained, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. GST-Rad was also phosphorylated in vitro with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA, Sigma; 20 μg of fusion protein/25 units of PKA/assay) in a kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT), and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described above. When Rad was to be separated from its fusion partner GST, the phosphorylated GST-Rad beads were incubated in a cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2) containing 0.2 μg thrombin (Sigma) at room temperature for 60 min(19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar). Two potential PKA-mediated phosphorylation sites are located near the COOH terminus of Rad (Ser218 and Ser234). Rad also possesses several potential V8 protease cleavage sites. Cleavage at Glu206, Glu220, and Glu230 can produce two peptides bearing potential PKA phosphorylation sites, with predicted molecular weight of 1.6 and 4.1 kDa, respectively. V8 protease (Boehringer Mannheim) was used to cleave between these two sites. GST-Rad-Sepharose beads (10 μg) were incubated in kinase buffer in the presence of 25 units of PKA and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30°C for 15 min. The beads were washed four times with the same buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of V8 cleavage buffer (250 μl of SDS-PAGE stacking gel buffer, pH 6.8, 100 μl of 10% SDS, 100 μl of glycerol, 2 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, 3 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol, and 630 μl of H2O) followed by a 2-min boiling to denature the protein. After brief centrifugation, V8 protease was added to the supernatant, and the cleavage was carried out at 37°C for 1 h(25Cleveland D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The phosphopeptides were resolved in 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained, destained, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 1-5 min. As was predicted from its primary sequence, Rad bound [α-32P]GTP in a rapid, saturable, and time-dependent fashion. GTP binding to GST-Rad was rapid with half-maximal binding at 1 min and maximal by 10 min at 22°C (Fig. 2A); GST alone had no guanine nucleotide binding activity (data not shown). Binding of both GTP and GDP to Rad was Mg2+-dependent (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast to p21N−ras which shows increased exchange rates at low Mg2+ concentration(22Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GTP and GDP binding to Rad were minimal when the calculated Mg2+ was 0.5 μM, but increased at higher Mg2+ concentrations, reaching maxima at 1 and 10 mM of MgCl2, respectively (Fig. 2B). Binding to Rad could also be demonstrated using a GTP overlay assay. Binding of [α-32P]GTP was completely blocked by 0.1 mM of GTP, GTPγS, GDP, and GDPβS, whereas pyrimidine nucleotides did not compete to any extent (Fig. 2C). ATP also showed slight inhibition of GTP binding to Rad at high concentrations (Fig. 2D). To assess GTPase activity, Rad was loaded with [α-32P]GTP, free nucleotides were washed away, and bound GTP was subjected to hydrolysis in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2. At each time point, the reaction was stopped, and bound nucleotides were eluted and analyzed by TLC. Under these conditions, Rad itself produced slow hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, suggesting a low intrinsic GTPase activity. Addition of cytosol from L6 myoblasts greatly accelerated GTP hydrolysis by Rad (Fig. 3A). In fact, almost all the bound GTP was converted to GDP by 20-min incubation at room temperature in the presence of 40 μg of total cytosolic protein. A similar stimulation was observed using both cytosolic and membrane fractions from 3T3-L1 cells, 3T3-F442A cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown). Denaturation of the L6 cell extract at 100°C for 2 min completely inactivated this GAP activity, suggesting that this activity was due to a protein in the cell extract that stimulated Rad GTPase (Fig. 3B). A panel of known GAPs, including Ras-GAP, NF1, p190, Rap-GAP, and IQGAP1(26Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were tested for their abilities to stimulate Rad-GTPase activity. None of these proteins had noticeable effect on the GTPase activity of Rad (Fig. 3B). Rad-GAP activity was present in every rat tissue tested, although the maximal stimulation with skeletal muscle was somewhat lower than that of other tissues (Fig. 3C). Stimulation of Rad GTPase activity by different rat tissues was dose-dependent (Fig. 3D). Aligning the sequences of Rad and Gem with Ras (Fig. 1) reveals a number of potentially interesting, nonconservative sequence substitutions which could affect GTP binding and GTPase properties. First, the highly conserved Gly12 in Ras is replaced by Pro61 in Rad and Gln84 in H-Gem. Also both Rad and Gem possess a Glu at the position corresponding to the highly conserved Gly60 in Ras. On the other hand, certain functionally important residues are conserved, for example, Ser66 and Gln109 in Rad (corresponding to Ser17 and Gln61 in Ras, respectively). Mutation of Ser17 to Asn creates a dominant negative Ras, whereas Gln61 is often found to be mutated, alone or together with Val12, in transforming forms of Ras (27Ren M. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To better understand the structure-function relationship of Rad, we performed in vitro site-directed mutagenesis. Changes in activity of the various mutants with regard to GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis are summarized in Table 1. As with Ras itself, a point mutation of Ser66 to Asn66 in Rad completely abolished its ability to bind GTP (Fig. 4B), indicating the critical role of this residue in GTP binding or overall structure of the protein. Point mutation of Pro61 to Gly (the amino acid found in Ras) slightly decreased GTP binding, whereas modification of this residue to Val (a transforming mutation in Ras) did not result in significant changes in either GTP binding or hydrolysis. Mutation of Gln109 to His slightly increased GTP binding, but was without effect on GTP hydrolysis. However, a double mutant, P61V/Q109H, showed extremely high intrinsic GTPase activity, which was further stimulated to near complete GTP hydrolysis within 3 min upon addition of as low as 10 μg of total rat liver cytosolic proteins.Tabled 1Figure 4:Mutational analysis of Rad. Point mutations were made using wild type pGEX-2T-rad as template. Each mutant was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A, [α-32P]GTP binding to wild type (○) and S66N (•) Rad.

GTP hydrolysis was assessed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Data are the means of three (A, triplicate) or two (B, single data points) separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Examination of the amino acid sequence of Rad indicated that Rad possesses one potential ATP-binding site near amino terminus (G23TGTQG28) and two potential phosphorylation sites for PKA (28Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) near the carboxyl-terminal, RRDS218 and RRES234. Rad also has at least 10 potential sites for protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation throughout its primary sequence. To test whether Rad is a substrate for PKA or PKC, GST-Rad was subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of PKA or a constitutively active PKC (provided by Heimo Riedel of Joslin Diabetes Center) and followed by thrombin cleavage of Rad from GST. Rad was phosphorylated in the presence, but not absence, of PKA (Fig. 5A); however, it failed to undergo in vitro phosphorylation in the presence of constitutively active PKC (data not shown). To confirm the sites of PKA phosphorylation, the phosphorylated Rad was digested with V8 protease which cleaves between the two potential PKA phosphorylation sites. If the cleavage was complete, a phosphopeptide of 1.6-kDa bearing Ser218 and another of 4.1 kDa with Ser234 should be resolved. After extensive cleavage, two phosphopeptides were observed in gel electrophoresis; one migrated just above the dye front on a 15% SDS-PAGE, whereas the other migrated between the 6.5- and 3.4-kDa molecular markers (Fig. 5B). This result suggested that both sites were phosphorylated by PKA. To determine if Rad might form a complex through specific protein-protein interaction with a kinase capable of phosphorylating Rad, GST-Rad-Sepharose beads were used to precipitate the extract from human skeletal muscle. After extensive washing, Rad was found to precipitate a kinase activity which catalyzed in vitro phosphorylation of Rad in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 5C). A similar result was obtained with the lysate from L6 myoblast cells (Fig. 5D). Rad precipitated this kinase activity from all the cell lines and tissues tested in both the GTP- and GDP-bound states (data not shown). Phosphorylation was more prominent in the presence of GDP than GTP. This most likely reflects a preferential competition of GTP with [γ-32P]ATP during the phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by this endogenous kinase appears to be on serine/threonine residues, since anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies did not recognize phosphorylated Rad (data not shown). At present, the nature of the Rad-associated kinase from various tissues and cell lines is unknown. However, it is probably not PKA, since it was not stimulated by forskolin or inhibited by protein kinase A inhibitor (data not shown). We have expressed Rad, a novel Ras-related protein overexpressed in skeletal muscle of humans with type II diabetes, characterized its nucleotide binding and enzymatic activity and regulation by covalent and noncovalent interactions. We find that Rad is a GTP-binding protein and GTPase-regulatable by a specific GAP-like activity and may also be subjected to serine/threonine phosphorylation. Binding of GTP to Rad is fast and saturable, a characteristic shared by all Ras-like proteins. For example, like human Ha-Ras p21 (29McGrath J.P. Capon D.J. Goeddel D.V. Levinson A.D. Nature. 1984; 310: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and other small G proteins(30Bhullar R.P. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), Rad bound specifically [α-32P]GTP after transfer to nitrocellulose filters, indicating that in a denatured state Rad still retains the ability for ligand binding. However, Rad displays several features that are clearly different from the other members of Ras family. Thus, N-Ras has a low and linear rate of guanine nucleotide binding at high (5 mM) magnesium concentrations and increases its exchange rate at low (0.5 μM) magnesium concentrations(22Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, Rad binds minimal amounts of GTP or GDP at 0.5 μM Mg2+, but increases binding significantly at higher magnesium concentrations. Considering that intracellular [Mg2+] is about 30 mM(31Murray R.K. Mayes P.A. Granner D.K. Rodwell V.W. Harper's Biochemistry. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CA1990: 441-458Google Scholar), with [GTP] far exceeding [GDP](32McCormick F. Cell. 1989; 56: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that Rad may be in a state of high activity in the normal magnesium concentration in cells. The unique pattern of Mg2+ dependence may result from the sequence variation of Rad in the G3 domain (which is known to be important for interaction with Mg2+/GTP(33Willumsen B.M. Papageorge A.G. Kung H.F. Bekesi E. Robins T. Johnsen M. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), since the highly conserved Ala59 and Gly60 residues in most other Ras proteins are replaced with Trp107 and Glu139 residues in Rad. However, when these two nonconserved amino acid residues are changed to be identical to those in Ras, the “Ras-like” binding characteristics (with regard to Mg2+ dependence) are not restored. On the other hand, like the mutant RasAsn GAPs interact with GTPases and greatly accelerate the rate of GTP hydrolysis. Most GAPs are relatively specific in that they exert their effects only on certain subfamilies or subtypes of GTPases. Rad has low intrinsic GTPase activity, and thus, it is reasonable to suggest that to efficiently “turn off” Rad in vivo, a GAP must exist. However, Rad is unresponsive to p120 GAP and NF1 which act on Ras(34Eccleston J.F. Moore K.J.M. Morgan L. Skinner R.H. Lowe P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27012-27019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), p190 which acts on Rac and Rho GTPases(24Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), Rap-GAP(35Rubinfeld B. Crosier W.J. Albert I. Conroy L. Clark R. McCormick F. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the recently cloned IQGAP1(26Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific Rad-GAP activity, however, is present in all mammalian tissue and cell lines studied. The fact that rat skeletal muscle extract does not show a linear dependence of GAP activity suggests co-expression of other factors that can also affect the GTPase activity of Rad. The ubiquitous distribution of Rad-GAP activity may suggest a role for Rad or Rad-related proteins such as Gem in a variety of cells. At present, the exact nature of Rad-GAP is not known. Preliminary studies have shown that it is a heat-sensitive protein, highly hydrophilic and positively charged at pH 6.0, and elutes in a molecular mass range between 60 and 100 kilodaltons on gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). Purification and characterization studies are under way to identify this GAP. Although phosphorylation of Ras-like proteins does not regulate their GTP binding and GTPase activities, phosphorylation may affect cellular localization. For example, Rap1B in platelets is translocated from membranes to the cytoplasm when it is phosphorylated by PKA in response to prostaglandin E1 and dibutyryl cAMP stimulation. This also increases the sensitivity of Rap1B to its guanine nucleotide exchange factor(36Hata Y. Kaibuchi K. Kawamura S. Hiroyoshi M. Shirataki H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6571-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rab4 is serine-phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase in mitotic cells, and this enables Rab4 to be released into cytosol(37vander Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Subsequent dephosphorylation allows reassociation of soluble Rab4 with membranes upon exit of cells from mitosis. Rad may also be regulated by phosphorylation. Indeed, Rad is phosphorylated in vitro by PKA near its carboxyl terminus. The function of this phosphorylation is unknown, but phosphorylation did not affect Rad's GTP binding or basal and stimulated GTPase activity (data not shown), consistent with the effects of phosphorylation on Rap1A, Rap1B, and Rab4. Rad is also phosphorylated by a kinase that appears to be constitutively associated with Rad which we have tentatively termed Rad-associated kinase. Rad-associated kinase is a serine/threonine protein kinase, but is clearly different from PKA, since it is not stimulated by forskolin or inhibited by PKA inhibitor. The identification of this kinase activity may help to elucidate the signal transduction pathway in which Rad is involved.

Cell. 1992; 69: 205-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), it has been impossible to study the processing of pro-NDF isoforms and the structural complexity of naturally occurring soluble NDF forms in relation to their possible functional multiplicity. To overcome this, we started to study the expression of NDF in CHO cells which may process and secrete NDF isoforms similar to those from natural sources. In this report, we express several human and rat NDF isoforms in engineered CHO cells containing respective pro-NDF clones and isolate the secreted recombinant molecules to apparent purity for biological and structural characterizations. The secreted, biologically active NDF isoforms appear to be heavily glycosylated and processed at both N- and C-terminal ends. Multiple N- and O-linked glycosylations consistently take place at the NDF spacer domain. The glycosylated NDF forms can stimulate receptor autophosphorylation with similar potency. In a subsequent paper, molecular behavior and biological characteristics of these NDF glycoforms are compared(25Lu H.S. Chang D. Philo J.S. Zhang K. Naahi L.O. Liu N. Zhang M. Sun J. Wen J.

Proteases (endoproteinases Glu-C and Lys-C, and trypsin) were products of Boehringer Mannheim. A number of rat and human pro-NDF cDNA clones (i.e. NDF-α1, α2, α3, β1, β2, β3, and β4, etc.) have been isolated in our laboratory(19Wen D. Peles E. Cupples R. Suggs S.V. Bacus S.S. Luo Y. Trail G.

Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard M. Kuang W.J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, pro-NDF clones, i.e. human NDF-α1, -α2, -β1, and -β2, rat NDF-α2 and -β4, were selected for mammalian expression. The coding sequences of α and β forms (both human and rat species) differ in the C-terminal EGF domain which extends to the membrane and the cytoplasmic domains(21Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Their sequence divergence starts from the last disulfide loop of the EGF domain as indicated in Fig. 1. Similar approaches were used to construct various pro-NDF expression plasmids for rat pro-NDF-α2 and β4 and human pro-NDF-α2. The following is an example for construction of rat pro-NDF-α2 expression vector. Rat pro-NDF-α2 cDNA encoding 632 amino acids was subjected to polymerase chain reaction using two primers. The 37-base oligonucleotide sense primer has the sequence: 5′-CGG TCT AGA AGC TTC CAC CAT GTC TGA GCG CAA AGA A-3′. It included 5′ XbaI and HindIII restriction cloning sites followed by the Kozak consensus sequences CCACC, as well as the initial 18 bases of the rat NDF coding sequences. The 30-base oligonucleotide antisense primer had the sequence: 5′-GCC GTC GAC CTA TTA CCA TTC GCT ATG AGG-3′. It included a SalI site, two tandem translation stop codons, and 15 bases of the carboxyl end of the rat NDF coding sequences. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with XbaI and SalI to generate a `1.4-kilobase DNA fragment containing the entire coding sequence of rat pro-NDF-α2. This fragment was then subcloned into the expression vector pDSRα2 (see European patent application A20398753) that had been cut with XbaI and SalI. The sequence of the entire insert was verified through DNA sequencing. The final plasmid was designated at pDSRα2/rNDF-α2. Chimeric pro-NDF molecules were designed in which the 197-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the human NDF-α1, NDF-β1, or NDF-β2 (coding for NDF of 542, 645 and 637 amino acids, respectively) was substituted with the 157-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the rat NDF-α2. A Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO D−) deficient in dihydrofolate reductase was transfected with the above mentioned plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation(21Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The transfected clones that express the highest NDF level were selected for generating conditioned media as described(21Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell.

Pooled and filtered serum-free conditioned medium (20-100 liters) derived from engineered CHO cells was concentrated to 1-2 liters in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.0) with a Pellicon diafiltration system (Millipore, MA), using a membrane with a 10-kDa molecular size cutoff. Total NDF content in the concentrated retente was determined by Western blot analysis (21Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B.

The total protein concentration was estimated by UV absorption at 280 nm or by a Coomassie Brilliant Blue binding assay supplied by the vendor (Bio-Rad). Three chromatographic steps, i.e. heparin-Sepharose, DEAE-Sepharose, and phenyl-Sepharose chromatographies, were applied to isolate various NDF isoforms. The clarified and concentrated material (1-2 liters) as described above was loaded on a 80-ml heparin-Sepharose column (1.5 × 15 cm), pre-equilibrated with PBS buffer (pH 7.2), at a flow rate of 0.3 liter/h. Conditions for washing the column and eluting NDF from the column were described previously(16Peles E. Bacus S.S. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Wen D. Ogden S.G. Ben Levy R. Yarden Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 205-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). NDF-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS buffer. Dialyzed material was then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose 6B (fast flow) column (1.2 × 20 cm) equilibrated with the same PBS buffer as described. After washing the column with PBS buffer, it was then developed with a 300-ml gradient of 0.02 M to 0.5 M NaCl in PBS (pH 7.2) using a flow rate of 50 ml/h. Eluates were monitored at 280 nm; and fractions containing NDF activity or exhibiting NDF protein band were pooled for subsequent purification. Ammonium sulfate was added to the pooled NDF fraction to achieve a concentration of 1.5 M. The material was immediately loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose 6B column (1.2 × 20 cm) pre-equilibrated with the initial buffer which contains PBS buffer and 1.5 M ammonium sulfate. After loading, the column was washed with the initial buffer to remove any unbound non-NDF proteins. The NDF protein was eluted with a 300-ml gradient of 1.5 to 0 M ammonium sulfate in PBS buffer (pH 7.2) at a flow rate of 1-1.5 ml/min. Fractions in 2-ml volume were collected, and protein peaks were measured on-line at 280 nm. Fractions containing a 40-44-kDa protein band were pooled, dialyzed against PBS buffer, concentrated, and then sterile-filtered by a 0.2-μm membrane and sample aliquots were transferred to vials and stored at −80°C. Overall NDF yield was obtained from biospecific affinity assays as described(26Lu H.S. Chang D. Brankow D. Wen D. J. Chromatogr. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of column fractions under reducing conditions was performed using 14% Novex Tricine precast gels. Electrophoresis was run using Novex Tricine buffer containing 0.1% SDS and a fixed voltage at 100 V for 1.5-2 h. The final purified NDF preparations were run on 14% gels using a Laemmli system as described previously(16Peles E. Bacus S.S. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Wen D. Ogden S.G. Ben Levy R. Yarden Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 205-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Assays for tyrosine phosphorylation activity were performed in MDA-MB453 human cancer cells according to previously described procedures(16Peles E. Bacus S.S. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Wen D. Ogden S.G. Ben Levy R. Yarden Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 205-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of membrane-associated receptor was monitored by phosphotyrosine antibody coupled with chemiluminescence detection after SDS-PAGE and electroblotting of the isolated membrane fractions. Acid hydrolysis of purified NDF samples (1-3 nmol) using 6 N HCl was performed as described previously(27Lu H.S. Lai P.H. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 368: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The hydrolysates were dried, reconstituted, and injected into the Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer for compositional analysis. Analysis of Rat1-EJ cell-derived NDF was performed with an automated PTC-derivative analyzer Model 420 (Applied Biosystems) with procedures according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Sequential Edman degradations (28Lu H.S. Clogston C.L. Wypych J. Fausset P.R. Lauren S. Mendiaz E.A. Zsebo K.M. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8102-8107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were performed either with ABI Model 477 and 473 sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or with HP1000 sequencers (Hewlett Packard) using sequencing programs recommended by the manufacturers. CHO cell-derived rat NDF-α2 and -β4, as well as human NDF-α1 and -β2 (200-300 μg) were dried by Speed Vac and reconstituted in 300 μl of 0.3 M Tris-HCl containing 6 M guanidine HCl (pH 8.4). Samples were then reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetate as described(29Jones M.D. Merewether L.A. Clogston C.L. Lu H.S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 125-146Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Alkylated NDF samples at 0.5 mg/ml in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 2 M urea were digested by endoproteinase Lys-C at 37°C for 18-24 h at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:100. The peptide mixture was separated by reverse-phase HPLC and monitored at 215 nm using a Vydac C4 column (4.6-mm inner diameter × 25 cm, 300 Å) and an HP 1090 liquid chromatography system equipped with a diode-array detector and a workstation. The column was equilibrated with mobile phase A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 3 to 35% mobile phase B (90% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for 70 min, then to 50% B for 10 min and washed with 95% B. HPLC analysis was conducted at ambient temperature with a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The peptide peaks were collected manually and dried immediately after collection. Dried samples were then reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to further analysis. Glycopeptide fractions obtained from previously mentioned peptide mapping were pooled, dried, and reconstituted in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.9). The reconstituted sample was digested with endoproteinase Glu-C at 25°C for 24 h at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:10. The digest mixture was further incubated with trypsin at 37°C for 4 h at an enzyme-to-substrate rate of 1:5. The resulting peptide mixture was separated by reverse-phase HPLC as described above. The elution was performed with a linear gradient from 3 to 15% B for 20 min, to 25% B for 40 min, and then to 50% B for 40 min, followed by a wash with 95% B with the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 25°C. The molecular mass of the purified peptides was determined by mass spectrometry using a Sciex APIII electrospray mass spectrometer as described (29Jones M.D. Merewether L.A. Clogston C.L. Lu H.S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 125-146Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or a Krato MALDI matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometer. Samples analyzed by laser desorption mass spectrometry were first spotted on a metal probe surface in a 0.5-μl volume and dried. After the probe surface was further coated with 0.5 μl of sinapic acid or 4-cyanohydroxyl sinapic acid at 5-10 mg/ml concentration and dried to completeness, samples were ready for laser desorption mass spectrometry analysis. We have constructed various expression plasmids containing rat, human, and human-rat chimeric pro-NDF DNAs. These plasmids were prepared for transfection in CHO cells to express different human and rat NDF forms. Stable clones expressing higher levels of NDFs were subcloned and selected for large scale production and for subsequent isolation of biologically active NDFs. For example, secretion of rat NDFs ranges from approximately 300 to 700 ng/ml of culture medium. Human NDFs were expressed at much lower levels (<50 ng/ml) when full-length human pro-NDF (such as human NDF-α2) genes were constructed into the expression vector. However, we found that levels of NDF mRNA and the respective membrane-bound pro-NDF protein expressed by the human NDF clones are comparable to those found in the rat pro-NDF clones. Therefore, it is likely that inefficient processing of membrane-bound pro-NDFs may be partly related to the low expression of human NDFs. We also found that expression of soluble human NDFs can be increased to the level of rat NDF forms using human-rat chimeric pro-NDF constructs (i.e. human NDF-α1, -β1, and -β2) where the cytoplasmic domain of each human NDF isoform was replaced by the same domain for rat NDF-α2. These observations suggest that cytoplasmic tails of human pro-NDF genes may be responsible for the low secretion levels of human NDF by CHO cells, possibly due to the effect of the isoforms-specific rate of pro-NDF processing(21Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell.

Fig. 2A shows the three chromatographic separation steps used in the isolation of rat NDF-α2. Following heparin, DEAE, and phenyl-Sepharose chromatographies, recombinant NDF can be prepared to homogeneity with an overall yield of 36.5% (Table 1). Fig. 2B (panels 1-3) illustrates typical SDS-PAGE profiles of the eluting fractions in reducing conditions (using Tricine gels as described) for the detection of 40-44-kDa NDF bands for samples pooled at different purification steps.Tabled 1Figure 2:A, chromatographic separation of recombinant rat NDF-α2.

Fig. 3(top panel) shows the SDS-PAGE of the final purified recombinant preparations including rat NDF-α2 and -β4 (lanes 2 and 3), as well as human NDF-α1, -β1, and -β2 (lanes 4, 6, and 7, respectively) after Coomassie Blue staining (using Laemmli gels as described). Human NDF-α2 expressed by a human pro-NDF clone also exhibited a similar molecular size (lane 5). Every NDF isoform together with Rat1-EJ cell-derived NDF (lane 8) exhibits a single diffused band at 40-44 kDa with indistinguishable electrophoretic mobility from each other. The diffused bands shown in all samples are indicative of being glycosylated in all NDF preparations. As a comparison, bacterially derived human NDF-α14-241 exhibited a sharp band with an estimated molecular mass (~30 kDa) slightly larger than the expected value (25 kDa). Sequence analyses revealed that purified rat NDF-α2 and -β4 have the same N-terminal sequence: KEGRGKGKGKKKDRGSR-, while the N-terminal sequence of human NDF-α1, -α2, -β1, or -β2 was also determined to be identical: KEGRGKGKGKKKERGS-. These sequences are 4 amino acids shorter than the N terminus predicted from pro-NDF genes (17Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H.

Biophysical analyses confirmed that all NDF isoforms are monomeric, but have an extended ellipsoidal shape in solution. All full-length NDFs are similar in secondary and tertiary structures and they contain no α-helix but are abundant in β-strand structures. A small NDF fragment containing only the epidermal growth factor domain is also rich in β-strand structures, but exhibits tertiary structure different from the long NDF forms. Monoclonal antibodies that selectively recognize epidermal growth factor domains of human NDF-α or NDF-β can specifically bind the respective NDF-α and -β isoforms independent of NDF origins. Western blot analysis and quantitative binding assays further identify that an NDF preparation produced naturally from Rat1-EJ cells contains both α and β isoforms in a 3 to 2 ratio. In receptor-binding competition experiments, human and rat NDF-β isoforms have higher affinity than NDF-α isoforms. NDF-β isoforms can dramatically enhance the stimulation of DNA synthesis for transfected NIH3T3 cells that overexpress HER-3 and HER-4 receptors, while NDF-α isoforms can only stimulate proliferation of HER-4-transfected cells with lower activity.

The molecular diversity of neuregulin has raised interesting questions on aspects of structural and functional multiplicity of various isoforms. It is still unknown whether each molecular species within the family can display distinct biological actions in its membrane-bound or secreted form. Little is known about the contribution of the N-terminal Ig unit to the biological function of NDFs. There has also been no detailed analysis on structural characteristics of glycosylated NDF.

In this report, we investigate further the molecular, immunological, and biological properties of these isolated isoforms and compare some of the properties to the Escherichia coli-derived, nonglycosylated molecules. All full-length NDF molecules, either glycosylated or nonglycosylated, and α or β isoforms, displayed similar structural folding and behaved as though they have a very extended, elongated shape. However, α and β isoforms are immunologically and biologically distinct.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression of NDF Molecules in E. coli and CHO CellsRecombinant human and rat NDF molecules and the NDF EGF domains were produced in E. coli and purified according to previously described procedures(4Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanagahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Extra methionine residues were added at the N terminus of NDF as initiation sites for protein translation. To conserve structural differences near the juxtamembrane region among isoforms, the following human and rat NDF isoforms containing varying sequence lengths were prepared: human NDF-α214–241, human NDF-β114–246, human NDF-β214−238, rat NDF-α214–2254, and rat NDF-β414–247. Two EGF domains for human NDF-α2177–241 and NDF-β1177–246 were also prepared using similar procedures. Unless stated, these molecules are described later using abbreviated names such as human NDF-α2, rat NDF-β4, etc. Production of CHO cell-derived human and rat NDF isoforms and preparation of rat NDF from Rat1-EJ cells were described previously(1Peles E. Bacus S.S. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Wen D. Ogden S.G. Ben Levy R. Yarden Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 205-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The protein concentration for all preparations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm and by quantitative amino acid analysis.Analytical Gel FiltrationGel filtration of NDF was performed in an FPLC Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) pre-equilibrated with 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.1 to 1.0 M NaCl depending on experimental conditions. Samples were analyzed by an HP-1050 Ti system (Hewlett Packard) equipped with an automatic sampler, a multiple wavelength detector, and a ChemStation for data collection and processing. The experiments were performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with detection at 225 nm. The column was calibrated using proteins of known molecular weight.Light ScatteringMolecular weights were also determined using on-line laser light scattering, refractive index, and absorbance detectors in series with a size-exclusion chromatography system (see above). As described previously(11Arakawa T. Langley K.E. Kameyama K. Takagi T. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Arakawa T. Wen J. Philo J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), by combining the outputs of all three detectors, and using the extinction coefficients calculated for the polypeptide, it is possible to determine the molecular weight of the polypeptide component of a glycoprotein, since by this procedure the carbohydrate contributions to the scattering and refractive index signals are canceled.Analytical UltracentrifugationSedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out in a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge with measurement at 280 nm. Equilibrium experiments were done at 25°C and rotor speeds of 15,000 and 21,000 rpm with loading concentrations of ∼500, 250, and 125 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.1). Data for all three concentrations and 2 rotor speeds were simultaneously analyzed using non-linear least squares techniques similar to those in NONLIN(13Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Conversion of the measured buoyant molecular weight, Mb, to the true molecular weight requires a value for the partial specific volume, V, which cannot be estimated accurately for a glycoprotein of unknown carbohydrate content. Therefore, we use a self-consistent approach in which the total mass and the V calculated from its amino acid composition(14Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 90-125Google Scholar), while the carbohydrate is assumed to have a V of 0.63 ± 0.01 ml/g(15Shire S.J. Technical Note DS-837. Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA1992Google Scholar). It is then possible to uniquely solve for the total molecular weight from the measured Mb. The error in this calculated value is estimated by propagation of the error estimates for Mb and the V values of polypeptide and carbohydrate.Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20°C and 60,000 rpm and the sedimentation coefficient determined as described previously(16Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston1995Google Scholar). Conversion to standard conditions, calculation of Stoke's radii hydration, and axial ratios followed procedures described by Laue et al.(14Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 90-125Google Scholar), using the V and molecular weight determined by sedimentation equilibrium, and assuming that the hydration of the carbohydrate is 0.43 g/g, as calculated for the polypeptide.Circular Dichroism (CD) and Infrared Spectroscopic AnalysesCD measurements were obtained using a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter and cuvettes with a 0.02 cm (for far-UV CD) or 1 cm (for near-UV CD) path length. Thermal stability was determined using a Pelletier temperature control unit, a rectangular cuvette with a 0.1-cm path length, and a heating rate of 20°C/h. Changes in ellipticity at 215 nm were measured every 0.5°C, while spectra from 240 to 200 nm were determined every 2°C. Protein samples were clarified through sterile filtration using a 0.2-μm membrane, and all analyses were carried out in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.1).NDF was prepared for infrared spectroscopy by dialyzing against pure water, lyophilizing, and dissolving the lyophilized powder in a 20 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl buffer prepared in D2O (Sigma, 99.9% isotopic purity), with pD = 7.0. Protein concentrations were approximately 1.5-2.0% (w/v) for the E. coli-derived and CHO cell-derived proteins, respectively. Solutions were placed in infrared cells with CaF2 windows and 50-μg Teflon spacers. All spectra were collected using a Mattson Research Series FTIR spectrometer using a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector. Four thousand scans (15 min collection time) were co-added for each spectrum; resolution was set at 4 cm−1. Analysis of infrared spectra was done as described previously(17Prestrelski S.J. Byler D.M.

An NDF-α2 specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), 1H7A3, was produced by immunization of BALB/c mouse with human NDF-α2, while an NDF-β specific mAb, 10-125A, was generated by immunization with NDF-β1 EGF domain conjugated to Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem). After several booster injections, the spleen cells were fused with sp2/0 mouse myeloma according to the procedures described by Nowinski et al.(20Nowinski R.C. Lostrom M.E. Tam M.R. Stone M.R. Burnette W.N. Virology. 1979; 93: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Screening and cloning of the hybridomas were done by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The specificities of mAb were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot with all isoforms of NDF.Immunodetection of NDFs in Western blot analysis was done with mAb at a concentration of 5 μg/ml followed by a 1:1000 dilution of peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. The blot was then developed and visualized according to ECL instruction (Amersham, United Kingdom). The real-time biospecific interaction analysis (BIA) was performed using a BlAcore instrument (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described(20Nowinski R.C. Lostrom M.E. Tam M.R. Stone M.R. Burnette W.N. Virology. 1979; 93: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Biospecific affinity assays using BIAcore (Pharmacia) were employed to quantitate NDF that binds to specific antibodies as described(21Lu H.S. Chang D. Brankow D. Wen D. J. Chromatog. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar).Binding of NDF Isoforms to T47D Human Mammary Carcinoma CellsThe ligand binding analyses were essentially identical to a previously described procedure(4Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanagahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell.

NIH3T3 cells were then transfected with a plasmid DNA (500 ng) carrying human HER-3 or HER-4 full-length cDNA by a standard protocol using the calcium phosphate method. Transfected cells were selected by growing in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml gentamicin (G418) for 3 weeks. Cells resistant to gentamicin were collected and used for assays. Cell lines carrying HER-3 or HER-4 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml gentamicin.HER-3 or HER-4 transfected cells were plated in 6-well plates with a cell density of 105 cells/plate. After 24 h, cells were starved in serum-free medium for 6 h and then changed to medium containing the indicated concentrations of human or rat NDF isoforms. After 12 h incubation, the medium was pulse-labeled by [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/ml) for 2 h. The medium was then removed and the residual radioactivity washed by phosphate-buffered saline. Cells on the plate were harvested by cell scraper and counted for radioactivity.RESULTSDetermination of NDF Molecular Sizes in SolutionWhen glycosylated and nonglycosylated NDF isoforms were analyzed by gel filtration using a 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer + 0.1 M NaCl eluant, they consistently exhibited abnormal elution profiles which include extremely low peak height, broadness of peaks, and peak tailing (data not shown). This anomalous behavior of NDFs in the column may be due to ionic interaction at lower ionic strength and not an aberrant conformation in 0.1 M NaCl, as this phenomena can be corrected by increasing the NaCl concentration (optimum at 0.5-1 M concentration). Under high salt conditions, each NDF isoform eluted as a symmetrical, sharp peak with increased peak height when detected at 225 nm. After calibrating with proteins of known molecular mass, the molecular mass for CHO cell-derived NDF forms calculated from elution positions ranged from 118,000 ± 4,000 to 114,000 ± 3,000 kDa (Table 1). These molecular sizes are significantly larger than those determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel filtration analysis of E. coli-derived, nonglycosylated NDF isoforms gave molecular masses of 53,000-55,000 kDa which is also significantly larger than expected (approximately 25,000). These results suggest that NDFs may be dimeric in solution. However, in experiments using gel filtration in conjunction with light scattering detection, the polypeptide molecular weights of all human and rat NDF isoforms, nonglycosylated or glycosylated, were determined to be in the range between 21,000 and 26,000 (±3,000) (Table 1).Tabled 1Recombinant CHO-derived human NDF-α1 and rat NDF-α2 were further analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium. The molecular weight determined by this technique is 39,100 ± 1000 (38.5 ± 0.5% carbohydrate) for rat NDF-α2 and 37,200 ± 900 (35.6 ± 0.5% carbohydrate) for the human NDF-α1, with most of the uncertainty arising from that in the partial specific volume of the carbohydrate. Both data obtained from light scattering and sedimentation equilibrium experiments appear to indicate that the NDF molecule is monomeric in solution.With the true molecular weight of NDF known from light scattering and sedimentation equilibrium, we decided to confirm its molecular shape using sedimentation velocity. For CHO cell-derived human NDF-α1, the measured s20,w of 2.65 S implies a Stokes radius of 3.81 nm, which is 74% larger than expected for a spherical molecule of this molecular weight, and which would be consistent with a hydrated prolate ellipsoid with an axial ratio of ∼8. The 1.90 S sedimentation coefficient of recombinant human NDF-α2 produced in E. coli implies that it is also elongated, with an axial ratio similar to that of CHO cell-derived NDF.CD and FTIR AnalysesFig. 1A shows the near UV CD spectra of the CHO cell-derived NDF-α and -β isoforms. The spectra of the NDF-α and -β species are very similar, with fine structure in the 290 nm (Trp), 270-280 nm (Tyr), and 220-250 nm regions, indicating that these molecules display very similar structural folding in solution, and that the conserved Trp is in a similar environment in both NDF isoforms. A few differences are apparent, however. The human and rat NDF-β species all have stronger and better defined signals in the 270-280 nm region, indicating that there are differences in the environment(s) of Tyr residue(s). The CHO cell-derived NDF-β isoforms, regardless of species of origin, have one more tyrosine than the α-isoforms at the C-terminal tail. It therefore appears likely that this particular tyrosine is located in an asymmetric structural environment, and that its contribution to the spectral signal is stronger than that of the 5 tyrosines conserved in all NDF molecules.Figure 1:Near UV and far UV CD analysis (A and B, respectively) of CHO cell-derived NDF isoforms.

Both NDF-α and -β isoforms displayed a negative CD spectrum at 195 nm. All NDF species also appear to have a small positive peak in the 220-230-nm region. This structural characteristic appears in other proteins as well and is believed to arise from ring stacking of aromatic amino acids, probably Tyr, in β-sheet containing proteins(22Philo J. Rosenfeld R. Arakawa T. Wen J. Narhi L.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10812-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). The rest of the far UV CD spectra for all NDF isoforms are consistent with a protein containing β-sheets and unordered structures.CD spectra of E. coli-derived NDF isoforms and NDF-EGF domains were also measured and shown in Fig. 2, A and B. In the near UV CD region, these nonglycosylated isoforms also display structural features similar to glycosylated NDFs produced in CHO cells (Fig. 1A). The NDF-β species (Fig. 2A, spectra c and d) also have stronger and better defined spectra at 270-280 nm, which again may be due to the two extra tyrosines at the C termini of both human NDF-β1 and -β2 isoforms. There is an obvious difference between the spectra of the NDF species derived from E. coli and the spectra of the NDF's derived from CHO cells in the region near 245-240 nm. Whether human or rat NDF, α or β isoform, all CHO-derived NDF proteins have spectra which are characterized by an increase in ellipticity in this region, while the E. coli-derived molecules all have spectra which continue to be negative.Figure 2:Near UV and far UV CD analysis (A and B, respectively) of E. coli-derived NDF isoforms and NDF EGF domains.

Spectrum e, human NDF-β1 EGF domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The far UV CD spectra of E. coli-derived human NDF-α and -β isoforms and β-NDF EGF domain are shown in Fig. 2B. A strong negative CD band near 193-196 nm found in CHO cell-derived NDFs (Fig. 1B) is also common in E. coli-derived NDF isoforms (Fig. 2B, spectra a-d). However, there is an obvious spectral difference around 220-235 nm. The CHO proteins all display broad but distinct CD spectra in this region, which are missing from the E. coli-derived proteins. Nonetheless, the far UV CD spectra of NDF isoforms as described above appear to indicate that these molecules are not typical α helical proteins. The spectra of rat NDF-α2 in 1 M NaCl, 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) are identical to those obtained in phosphate-buffered saline, indicating that salt does not effect the conformation in solution.The main feature of the spectra of human NDF-β1 EGF domain consists of a trough from 320 to 250 nm (Fig. 2A, spectrum e), possibly arising from major contributions of the three disulfide bridges, with some fine structure from Tyr and Phe superimposed on it. This structural characteristic is thus very different from the spectra of the longer isoforms of glycosylated or nonglycosylated NDFs as studied above. Human NDF-β1 EGF domain also displays significantly different far UV CD spectrum than the full-length NDF's. There is a positive and broad 220-235-nm CD band and a negative CD band around 197 nm (Fig. 2B, spectrum e). Human NDF-α EGF domain also displays CD spectra similar to those of the type-β EGF domain (data not shown).The conformational stability of several NDF species was studied using thermal stability as a probe. This was determined by following changes in the far UV CD region upon heating as indicators for loss of secondary structure. As listed in Table 2, NDF-β EGF domain, like EGF itself, does not show a single cooperative transition upon melting and therefore its Tm (the transition midpoint) could not be determined. The Tm of various full-length NDF species were determined from changes in the ellipticity at 208 nm. E. coli-derived NDF isoforms have a Tm between 44 and 50°C. There appears to be a slight increase in Tm (=52 and 53°C) for CHO-derived NDF isoforms. The thermal denaturation of NDFs is irreversible, so a thorough thermodynamic analysis was not possible. Most of the β-sheet was recovered after cooling, but the 230-nm feature was never fully regained. However, all of the full-length NDF forms melted with a single cooperative transition which ranged over 10°C.Tabled 1The second derivative infrared spectra in the amide I region (1700-1620 cm−1) of E. coli-derived NDF and CHO cell-derived NDF isoforms are shown in Fig. 3. These spectra are related to the polypeptide backbone conformation (24Arnold G.E. Day L.A. Dunker A.K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7948-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) and are essentially identical for both α and β isoforms, as well as for both nonglycosylated and glycosylated isoforms (spectra a-d). Human NDF-α2 EGF domain also displays a spectrum similar to the full-length NDF molecules (spectrum e). These spectra contain a strong band at 1631-1634 cm−1 and a clear 1673-1678 cm−1 band. Curve fitting of the deconvoluted infrared spectra was used to provide quantitative estimates of secondary structures, and the resulting band assignments for various isoforms are listed in Table 3. Band assignments are based on previous literature reports(24Arnold G.E. Day L.A. Dunker A.K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7948-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H.

Peptide Protein Res. 1991; 37: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, by infrared studies, it is estimated that the conformations of the recombinant NDFs are essentially identical and consist of no α-helix, 42-52%β-sheet, a moderate amount of reverse turns, and the remaining disordered structures.Figure 3:FTIR analysis of NDF isoforms.

Although homologous desensitization can be well explained by the action of specific receptor kinases, the mechanisms of heterologous desensitization remain elusive. As an approach to evaluate the roles of Gq pathway in desensitization of calcium signaling, we expressed a constitutively active Gqα mutant (Gqα Q-L) together with platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Gqα Q-L expression completely attenuated the calcium-sensitive chloride current and the 45Ca release elicited by PAF. The Gq-mediated desensitization could not be ascribed to G protein/receptor uncoupling via receptor phosphorylation, because (i) PAF-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) synthesis was only partially suppressed and (ii) a mutated PAF receptor devoid of all Ser and Thr in the third cytoplasmic loop and in the C-terminal tail was also completely desensitized by Gqα Q-L. In Gqα Q-L expressing oocytes, microinjection of IP3 failed to elicit the calcium response, and the IP3 receptor, detected by a specific antibody, disappeared. Thus, the Gq-mediated desensitization can be most likely explained by IP3 receptor down-regulation.

Once a G protein-coupled receptor is activated with the first stimulus, cells often become unresponsive to the same agonist or even to others. Homologous and heterologous desensitizations are fundamental adaptive processes that terminate inflammatory reactions. A widely accepted mechanism of the homologous desensitization is a phosphorylation of an agonist-occupied receptor by specific receptor kinases, such as β-adrenergic receptor kinases(11Benovic J.L. Bouvier M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 405-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 12Palczewski K. Benovic J.L. Trends. Biochem.

Raths S. Singer-Kruger B. Riezman H. Cell. 1992; 71: 755-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that signals downstream of G proteins may not be indispensable for homologous desensitization in some systems. In contrast to homologous desensitization, heterologous desensitization occurs in a previously unoccupied receptor (or in its signaling pathway) and rationally requires signals downstream of the primarily activated G proteins. Thus, to better understand heterologous desensitization, it is crucial to know if G protein activation itself will induce desensitization. In an attempt to address this question and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we expressed wild and mutated PAF receptors together with a constitutively active Gqα mutant(15Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16De Vivo M. Chen J. Codina J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18263-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used a gene expression system in Xenopus oocytes, since this system allows us (i) to co-express multiple genes in a single cell, (ii) to sensitively detect calcium response by electrophysiological methods, and (iii) to microinject second messengers. We now report evidence that Gq activation attenuates subsequent chemotactic receptor-mediated calcium signaling and that the main event related to this desensitization is down-regulation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor. To prepare a mutant PAF receptor (PAFR-mut) lacking possible phosphorylation sites, C-terminal 40 amino acids of guinea pig PAF receptor cDNA were deleted, and Thr-212 was substituted with Ala (see Fig. 1B). A constitutively active guinea pig Gqα mutant in which Gln-209 was substituted with Leu (Gqα Q-L), were prepared as described(15Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16De Vivo M. Chen J. Codina J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18263-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These plasmids were subcloned into pBluescript SK(-) (Toyobo Inc. Tokyo). Stage VI-VII oocytes were treated with collagenase (type II, Sigma) and manually defoliculated as described previously(1Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Plasmids were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes located downstream of the coding regions, and cRNA was synthesized in vitro as described previously(1Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 2Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Sakanaka C.

Oocytes were injected with cRNAs, incubated for 48 h in modified Bath's saline (15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 2.4 mM NaHCO3, 0.3 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgSO4) at 22°C and subjected to functional assays. Crude oocyte membrane was prepared exactly as described(17Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Crude membrane proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, and Xenopus IP3 receptor was probed with a specific rabbit antibody generated against C-terminal 155 amino acids of a cloned Xenopus IP3 receptor(17Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The first antibodies were detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and, for color development, we used 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and hydrogen peroxide. Detection of the calcium-dependent chloride current was done as described(1Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 2Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Sakanaka C. Mutoh H. Minami M. Bito H. Seyama Y. Matsumoto T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20400-20405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, oocytes were voltage-clamped at −80 mV in a bath perfused with oocyte saline (5 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 115 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (solution A) and challenged with superfusion of PAF or with an intracellular injection of IP3 lithium salt (Boehringer Mannheim) or with calcium chloride. Membrane current was continuously monitored, and occasionally, the reversal potential was measured (around −20 mV) to confirm that the observed current was indeed the chloride current. 45Ca efflux from oocytes was assayed essentially as described previously(18Amaya E. Musci T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 257-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). 20 oocytes were labeled with 45Ca (the final concentration, 1.85 MBq/ml) in 500 μl of calcium-free solution A for 3 h at room temperature and then were thoroughly washed with solution A and incubated in 500 μl of the same medium. 500 μl of the medium was collected before and after the addition of PAF, at defined intervals, and replaced with 500 μl of fresh solution A. Radioactivity in the medium collected at each interval was counted. Measurement of IP3 content in oocytes was performed as follows. 10 oocytes in 200 μl of solution A were stimulated with PAF for the indicated time, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 70 μl of 20% perchloric acid followed by vigorous vortexing. The sample were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and then the supernatant was neutralized with 10 M KOH. Precipitated salt was again removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was examined for IP3 content by a competitive radioreceptor assay using the D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate assay system (Amersham Corp.). The present study was designed to address two interrelated questions. First, are downstream events of Gq activation sufficient to desensitize the chemoattractant-induced calcium signaling? And, second, if Gq activation attenuates subsequent calcium signaling, what is the mechanism? As an approach to answer the questions, we expressed a GTPase-deficient mutant of guinea pig Gqα (Gqα Q-L) (15Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16De Vivo M. Chen J. Codina J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18263-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that has been demonstrated to activate downstream signals, including phospholipase C and MAP kinases(19De Vivo M. Iyenger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19671-19674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2T. Watanabe, I. Waga, I., Z. Honda, K. Kurokawa, and T. Shimizu, submitted for publication. As a model of a potential target of Gq-dependent heterologous desensitization, we used the guinea pig PAF receptor (PAFR) and its mutant (PAFR-mut). In PAFR-mut, Ser/Thr residues in the C-terminal tail, which play a crucial role in homologous desensitization(13Takano T. Honda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were totally removed by deletion. In addition, a single Thr in the 3rd cytoplasmic loop was substituted with Ala (see the schematic membrane structures in Fig. 1B). cRNAs of these constructs were prepared in vitro and injected in combination (25 ng of each cRNA/oocyte, if not otherwise stated) into Xenopus oocytes. We first examined the PAF (10 nM) induced calcium response by monitoring the calcium-operated chloride current(1Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 2Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Sakanaka C. Mutoh H. Minami M. Bito H. Seyama Y. Matsumoto T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20400-20405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, in oocytes expressing PAFR alone, there was a considerable response to 10 nM PAF, and co-expression of Gqα Q-L with PAFR completely suppressed this response. Co-expression of native Gqα was without effect (Fig. 1). Viability of the oocytes, as checked by resting membrane potential, was not affected by Gqα Q-L expression (−40 ± 12 mV versus −38 ± 15 mV, in Gqα and Gqα Q-L expressing oocytes, respectively; mean ± S.D., n = 4). The Gqα Q-L-induced loss of PAF sensitivity could not be ascribed to failure of PAFR expression, since PAF-induced IP3 synthesis was only partially suppressed in Gqα Q-L expressing oocytes (see below and Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 1C, the effect depended on the amount of microinjected Gqα Q-L cRNA. Gqα Q-L also desensitized PAFR-mut; the PAFR-mut-mediated membrane current completely disappeared in Gqα Q-L-expressing cells but not in Gqα-expressing cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, in contrast to desensitization by the homoligand(13Takano T. Honda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Gq-mediated desensitization could not be fully explained by the phosphorylation of Ser/Thr in the 3rd cytoplasmic loop and in the C-terminal tail. To analyze the machinery needed for the Gq-mediated desensitization, we dissected the signaling pathway by measuring changes in key second messengers, calcium and IP3. Oocytes were labeled with 45Ca, and the PAF-induced efflux of radioactivity was followed. PAF elicited a rapid and significant 45Ca efflux from oocytes injected with PAFR and Gqα cRNAs. In the oocytes expressing Gqα Q-L together with PAFR, this response disappeared, (Fig. 2A), thereby indicating that Gqα Q-L-suppressed elevation of intracellular calcium. We next measured change in the IP3 level by IP3-specific radioreceptor assay (Fig. 2B). Basal IP3 levels were below the detection limit in oocytes injected with Gqα Q-L/PAFR cRNAs as well as those injected with Gqα/PAFR cRNAs (detection limit; 0.25 pmol/10 oocytes), probably reflecting the rapid metabolism of IP3(20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the oocytes expressing Gqα together with PAFR, PAF elicited a time-dependent increase in IP3 level. In contrast to complete loss of the calcium efflux and the calcium-dependent chloride current, PAFR-mediated IP3 elevation was only partially inhibited by the co-expression of Gqα Q-L, by 40% at 1 min, and by 26% at 5 min. These observations led to the notion that prolonged activation of Gqα attenuated the PAFR-mediated calcium response by modifying the IP3-induced calcium release, which is mediated by IP3-sensitive calcium channel (tetrameric complex of IP3 receptor)(21Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not the IP3-induced calcium release was suppressed in oocytes expressing active Gqα, we microinjected IP3 into oocytes under the recording of the calcium-dependent chloride current. As shown in Fig. 3, microinjection of 40 pmol of IP3 elicited a large inward current in oocytes expressing Gqα, whereas the response was almost completely suppressed in Gqα Q-L-expressing oocytes. As Gqα Q-L did not suppress the current directly activated by microinjection of 50 pmol CaCl2 (Fig. 3A), the unresponsiveness to IP3 was not likely to be due to altered channel functions. We next asked whether the loss of IP3 responsiveness is accompanied by change in the level of IP3 receptor molecule. In control oocytes injected with Gqα cRNA, a single immunoreactive protein that corresponds to Xenopus IP3 receptor (17Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was detected by a specific polyclonal antibody raised against the cloned Xenopus IP3 receptor (17Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C, Exp.1). In Gqα Q-L expressing cells, this imunoreactivity almost completely disappeared (Fig. 3C, Exp.1). Decrease in the immunoreactivity depended on the amount of Gqα Q-L cRNA; oocytes injected with Gqα Q-L cRNA at 0.5 ng/oocyte contained an almost comparable immunoreactivity to that in oocytes injected with water or with Gqα cRNA (control), whereas the immunoreactive band disappeared in oocytes injected with Gqα Q-L cRNA at more than 5 ng/oocyte (Fig. 3C, Exp.2). These model experiments using a heterologous expression system revealed two novel findings concerning desensitization mechanisms of chemoattractant receptors. First, the continuous activation of downstream signals of Gq was sufficient to desensitize subsequent chemoattractant-induced calcium signaling. Second, one of the major mechanisms of the Gq-induced desensitization was down-regulation of the IP3 receptor molecule. The second point readily explains the heterologous desensitization of calcium signaling. Recently Quian et al.(22Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that expression of a GTPase-deficient G16α, a member of Gqα family, desensitized both bombesin- and PDGF-stimulated calcium mobilizations in Swiss3T3 cells. Since IP3 receptor is the first convergent point of the calcium signaling pathways originated from these different classes of receptors, the observed IP3 receptor desensitization/down-regulation may explain the heterologous desensitization in Swiss3T3 cells. Heretofore, several mechanisms for heterologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors have been proposed, including receptor phosphorylation by signal-dependent kinases, such as protein kinase C (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and down-regulation of G proteins(23Milligan G. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 413-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These scenarios, which affect receptor-mediated phospholipase C activation, could not fully explain the Gq-dependent desensitization. However, these mechanisms may explain the observed partial inhibition of IP3 production. This point should be studied further. Recently, IP3 receptor down-regulation was noted in rat cerebellar granular cells and in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells continuously exposed to acetylcholine(24Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using an active Gqα mutant, we obtained evidence that the down-regulation is not a ligand-specific phenomenon but that rather activation of Gq pathway is sufficient for the down-regulation. The loss of IP3 sensitivity due to the down-regulation was found to be the main reason for the Gq-induced heterologous desensitization of the PAF receptor-originated calcium signaling. These observations also imply that chemotactic factor receptors coupling to the Gq-family potentially elicit the same desensitization mechanisms. The next important problem is to determine if the proposed mechanisms can explain impaired leukocyte functions in inflammatory or autoimmune disorders(26Koh Y.Y. Dupuis R. Pollice M. Albertine K.H.

Immunopathol. 1989; 50: 132-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms of down-regulation of the IP3 receptor remain unclear. Elevation of intracellular levels of IP3 and calcium ion appear to be required for both the reversible inactivation of the channel function (29Hajnoczky G. Thomas A.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the degradation (25Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of IP3 receptor/calcium channel. In an in vitro study, IP3 receptor was found to be a good substrate for a calcium-activable neutral protease, calpain(30Magnusson A. Haug L.S. Walaas S.I. Ostvold C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the role of calpain in vivo is still controversial(25Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Xenopus oocyte system, in which these second messengers or a calpain-specific inhibitor, calpastatin (31Murachi T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (268) Google Scholar) can be readily introduced intracellularly, may serve as a useful system for studying the IP3 receptor turn-over.

The assembly protein is translated in the same open reading frame as the protease, resulting in sequence identity with the carboxyl terminus of the protease. The protease precursor undergoes autoproteolytic cleavages at two conserved sites, the release and maturation cleavage sites. The release cleavage site is upstream of the assembly protein domain and releases the protease catalytic domain from the amino terminus of the full-length precursor(2Welch A.R. Wood A.S. McNally L.M.

The protease precursor and the viral assembly protein are currently the only known substrates for the herpesvirus proteases, suggesting that either the release or maturation site cleavages, or both, are essential for viral replication.The CMV protease differs from the HSV-1 protease by virtue of a third autoproteolytic cleavage site near the center of its catalytic domain (17Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Hulmes J.D. Muzithras V.P. Jones T.R. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 497-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Welch A.R. McNally L.M. Hall M.R.T. Gibson W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7360-7372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This internal site, termed the I site, was mapped between amino acids Ala-143 and Ala-144 of the human CMV (HCMV) protease (17Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Hulmes J.D. Muzithras V.P. Jones T.R. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 497-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and produces an amino-terminal fragment of 15 kDa(N15) and a carboxyl-terminal fragment of 13 kDa (C13)(17Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Hulmes J.D.

Gibson W. Villarreal E.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An homologous site is also cleaved autocatalytically by the simian CMV protease(19Welch A.R. McNally L.M. Hall M.R.T. Gibson W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7360-7372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clear homologs of the I site are not apparent in the deduced amino acid sequences of proteases from α and γ herpesvirus. Moreover, the I site amino acid sequence exhibits only partial homology with the canonical release and maturation cleavage site sequences. These sites are highly conserved at the P4 to P1′ positions and usually have alanine and serine residues at the P1 and P1′ positions, respectively (2, 17, 21; using the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger(22Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4727) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis at these sites is very sensitive to mutation of the conserved P4-P1′ residues(23McCann III, P.J. O'Boyle II, D.R. Deckman I. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 526-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2I. Deckman and P. J. McCann III, unpublished results. Similarly, mutations within P4-P1′ of the I site prevent hydrolysis by the CMV proteases(19Welch A.R. McNally L.M. Hall M.R.T. Gibson W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7360-7372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jones T.R. Sun L. Bebernitz G.A. Muzithras V.P. Kim H.-J. Johnston S.H. Baum Z. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3742-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Proteolytic cleavage of protease zymogens can result in dramatically increased enzyme activity(26Neurath H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 1-13Google Scholar). I site cleavage does not increase the catalytic activity of HCMV protease since mutation of the I site to prevent its cleavage did not reduce enzyme activity(19Welch A.R. McNally L.M. Hall M.R.T. Gibson W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7360-7372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jones T.R. Sun L. Bebernitz G.A. Muzithras V.P. Kim H.-J. Johnston S.H. Baum Z. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3742-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so the protease precursor does not appear to be a zymogen. Instead, the occurrence of a cleavage site near the center of the CMV protease catalytic domain has led to the proposal that it inactivates the protease and could provide a mechanism for regulating enzyme activity during infection: the original I site designation stands for “inactivation site” (17Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Hulmes J.D. Muzithras V.P. Jones T.R. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 497-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Burck P.J. Berg D.H. Luk T.P. Sassmannshausen L.M. Wakulchik M. Smith D.P. Hsiung H.M. Becker G.W. Gibson W. Villarreal E.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis has demonstrated that amino acid sequences near the amino terminus and carboxyl terminus of both the HSV-1 and HCMV protease catalytic domains are required for enzyme activity(17Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Hulmes J.D. Muzithras V.P. Jones T.R. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 497-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Liu F. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1991; 88: 10792-10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, if I site cleavage causes dissociation of the resulting N15 and C13 products, then an inactive protease would be the product of this cleavage(20Burck P.J. Berg D.H. Luk T.P.

During purification of the HCMV protease catalytic domain from a recombinant bacterial source, however, I site cleavage products were found to co-fractionate with the intact HCMV catalytic domain through a variety of chromatographic separations even after a cycle of denaturation using 7 M urea(20Burck P.J. Berg D.H. Luk T.P. Sassmannshausen L.M. Wakulchik M. Smith D.P. Hsiung H.M. Becker G.W. Gibson W. Villarreal E.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sardana V.V.

Stevens III, D. R. O'Boyle II, C. L. DiIanni, M. G. Cordingley, and R. J. Colonno, manuscript in preparation. This suggested that I site cleavage does not cause the dissociation of the N15 and C13 products and raised the possibility that the complexed fragments might retain enzymatic activity. This report investigates the in vitro catalytic and kinetic properties of purified HCMV proteases that are either resistant to I site cleavage or that consist entirely of a noncovalent complex of I site cleavage products. By comparison to the properties of wild type HCMV protease, the effect of internal cleavage was determined.MATERIALS AND METHODSI Site Mutagenesis and Construction of N15 and C13 Fusion ProteinsSubstitutions of amino acids 143 and 144 of the HCMV UL80 protease were introduced into pGST-HCMV-256 using the polymerase chain reaction.3 Oligonucleotide primers spanning codons 139-148 were used, incorporating base substitutions for Ser (TCC), Thr (ACC), Val (GTC), Asn (AAC), or nonsense (TAG) codons at position 143 and Thr (ACG) or Val (GTG) codons at position 144 and which contained the adjacent AatII restriction enzyme site. The second polymerase chain reaction primer overlapped codons 1 and 2 of the protease, and polymerase chain reaction reaction conditions were according to the Perkin Elmer Cetus instructions except that 1 μg of template was used for seven cycles. Polymerase chain reaction products were gel-purified and digested with restriction enzymes AatII and SacII, which span the I site, for reconstruction of the mutated proteases. The vector was linearized with AatII followed by complete digestion with SacII. Each of the predicted mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The stop codon at amino acid 143 was used to generate the amino-terminal 15-kDa product fused to GST (GST-N15). To generate the carboxyl-terminal 13-kDa product fused to GST (GST-C13), two complementary oligonucleotides were obtained: 5′-GATCCTCGCTTTCGGGCTCGGAAACCACGCCGTTCAAAACAC-3′ and 5′-GTGTTTGAACGGCGTGGTTTCCGAGCCCGAAAGCGAG-3′. These sequences were designed to substitute Gly-Ser-Pro (from thrombin cleavage site) for Ala-144 and Thr-145, with BamHI and PmlI restriction enzyme overhangs for cloning. After annealing, these oligonucleotides were ligated to the parental pGST-CMV-256 vector digested with BamHI and PmlI. All purified oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.Expression, Purification, and Analysis of HCMV ProteaseGST fusion proteins of I site mutants were isolated from freshly transformed BL21 cells (Novagen) plated on LB-agarose plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures were grown in LB/ampicillin broth (29Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.5, at which time isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, then growth was continued for 3 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaCl, 1 mg/ml lysozyme) per liter of cell culture, using a Dounce homogenizer. Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the resulting suspension was sonicated. Lysates were then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the fusion proteins were found invariably in the insoluble pellets, which were resuspended in 20 ml of denaturing buffer (7 M urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT) on ice using a Dounce homogenizer. This solution was dialyzed against renaturing buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 25 mM NaCl) using 1000 volumes for a minimum of 8 h, 4°C, sufficient to permit affinity purification. The dialyzed sample was clarified at 26,000 × g, and the supernatant was mixed with previously hydrated and washed glutathione (GSH)-agarose beads (Sigma, 330 mg dry weight per liter of culture) for 20 min at 4°C with gentle rotation. After affinity binding, the beads were washed 5 times with 10 volumes of thrombin buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 8.8, 100 mM NaCl). For stability tests and initial enzymatic assays, I site mutants were eluted with buffer containing 5 mM glutathione (GSH). The intact fusion protein samples were dialyzed extensively versus renaturing buffer before being tested. The wild-type preparation included 43-kDa (GST-N15) and 13-kDa (C13) bands resulting from I site cleavage when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (15%) electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). (The N15 band was absent since the GST domain is still fused to the amino terminus of the protease.)To purify the intact catalytic domain, and N15 and C13 fragments, fusion proteins were not eluted with GST. Instead, one-tenth volume of thrombin buffer was added to create a dense slurry of GSH agarose beads + fusion protein. The bound fusion protein concentration was determined using Bradford protein assay solution (30, Bio-Rad) by removing a sample of the slurry. Human thrombin (Sigma) was then added to 0.1% (w/w) by stirring with the pipette tip, and the mixture was placed at 30°C for 10 min to cleave the fusion protein while bound to GSH-agarose. The cleaved protein was eluted five times with 1 volume of thrombin buffer, then mixed with 0.5 ml of hydrated benzamidine-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4°C for 20 min to selectively bind and remove contaminating thrombin. Beads were completely removed by centrifugation, and ammonium sulfate was added to 60% saturation. After overnight incubation at 4°C, the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in, and dialyzed against, denaturing buffer (3000-Da cutoff, Spectrum Medical Industries). Proteins were separated by chromatography on a Mono Q anion exchange column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) eluted with a gradient of 0 to 1 M NaCl. Under these conditions, C13 was recovered in the flow-through, N15 eluted at 180 mM NaCl, and the full-length protease eluted at 170 mM NaCl. Polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against the GST-HCMV protease fusion protein recognized both N15 and C13 in Western immunoblots (data not shown) after affinity purification and thrombin elution. Direct amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of HPLC-purified C13 fragment confirmed the predicted cleavage site (data not shown). Fractions of interest were pooled following SDS-PAGE and placed in a Centriprep 10 (Amicon) concentrator until the volume was reduced to 1% bed volume for gel filtration chromatography through Superose 12 equilibrated in 2 M NaSCN, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT(20Burck P.J. Berg D.H. Luk T.P. Sassmannshausen L.M. Wakulchik M. Smith D.P. Hsiung H.M. Becker G.W. Gibson W. Villarreal E.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting peaks were examined by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing the desired proteins were pooled. To reactivate the enzyme, the protease was placed into 100 volumes of renaturing buffer for 4 h followed by 1000 volumes of 2 × concentrated renaturing buffer for 16 h, followed by the addition of glycerin to 50% and an additional 16 h of dialysis. Aliquots were removed and placed at −80°C at a concentration of 0.1 to 3 mg/ml until use. Purity estimates ranged between 80 and 95% as determined using Coomassie-stained samples separated by SDS-PAGE. The intact protease was >90% pure as determined by mass spectroscopy (data not shown).HPLC Peptide AssayThe peptide substrates (designated mP4-P6′ and mP4-P8′) were based on the maturation site sequence of HCMV UL80 and were synthesized by the Dept. of Oncology and Peptide Chemistry, PRI, Princeton NJ (C. Mapelli and J. Tsao). The recognition sequences were VVNA-SCRLAT for mP4-P6′ and VVNA-SCRLATAS for mP4-P8′, the dash denoting the scissile bond.Relative rates of I site mutants were measured using 2.2 μM enzyme, 10 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tricine, pH 8.0, 200 μM peptide, and 50 μg/ml BSA. For kinetic studies, initial reaction rates were measured using mixtures (20Burck P.J. Berg D.H. Luk T.P. Sassmannshausen L.M. Wakulchik M. Smith D.P. Hsiung H.M. Becker G.W. Gibson W. Villarreal E.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 120 nM enzyme, 100 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 30% glycerol, and 200 μM peptide substrate. After incubating reactions at 30°C, 180 μl of 8 M guanidine HCl, 10 mM DTT was added to terminate the reaction, and 200 μl was injected onto an HPLC C4 column which was eluted with a 0 to 100% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The absorbance at 215 nm was recorded, and peaks corresponding to the peptide products were quantitated as described elsewhere(31Stevens J.T. Mapelli C. Tsao J. Hail M. O'Boyle II, D. Weinheimer S. DiIanni C.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Product peaks were confirmed by mass spectroscopy and peptide sequencing (data not shown). Assay results used for quantitative analysis resulted in less than 20% cleavage of the peptide. To determine kinetic constants, the substrate concentration was varied from 4 mM to 0.016 mM. Vmax, the maximal velocity, and Km, the Michaelis constant, were determined by fitting initial rate data to the equation [v = Vmax× S/(Km+ S)], using the KinetAsystII program for nonlinear regression, where v is the measured initial rate and S is the substrate concentration. Because it was not possible to titrate the active site of the HCMV protease, the exact proportion of each enzyme preparation that was active could not be determined, so the kinetic constants reported here should be considered estimations of their true values.Autocleavage Reaction ConditionsGST fusion proteins of I site mutants were eluted from GSH-agarose and incubated under assay conditions for up to 96 h. Samples were removed at time points during the incubation and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels were scanned using a laser densitometer (LKB Ultroscan) to quantitate the accumulation of I site cleavage products. The time of 50% cleavage was interpolated from these data points for the less stable samples and extrapolated for the more stable samples (those exhibiting less than 50% autocleavage at 96 h). Ratios of these values with that for wild type protease were compared to determine the relative stability ranking (Fig. 1).The HCMV protease catalytic domain was incubated at 8 μM (wild-type and A143T/A144T) in 100 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 30% glycerol for 0 to 96 hr. Samples were removed at time points, examined by SDS-PAGE, and assayed by peptide cleavage. Autocleavage was quantitated by laser densitometry of a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel. According to these measurements, 89% of the purified wild type protease sample was present initially as the intact 28-kDa species.Refolding and Assay of Recombinant FragmentsPurified recombinant N15 and C13 fragments in denaturing buffer were mixed in weight to weight (w/w) ratios of 3.3 to 0.16 (C13/N15), corresponding to approximate molar ratios of 4:1 to 1:4. The mixtures and individual fragments were placed in dialysis tubing and subjected to the reactivation protocol described above for affinity purification. Following the final dialysis, a protein measurement was made and enzyme activity was quantitated using the peptide cleavage assay. Native gel electrophoresis employed 10-20% polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStabilization of HCMV Protease by Site-directed MutagenesisThe HCMV protease catalytic domain was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified from insoluble inclusion bodies (see “Materials and Methods”).3 After affinity purification on glutathioneagarose, two contaminants were observed of the size expected from internal autocleavage of the protease at a previously mapped site between Ala-143 and Ala-144(17Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Hulmes J.D. Muzithras V.P. Jones T.R. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 497-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the I site. I site autocleavage of HCMV protease has been documented in HCMV-infected tissue culture cells, transfected cells, reticulocyte lysates, and E. coli(2Welch A.R. Wood A.S. McNally L.M. Cotter R.J. Gibson W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10792-10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Hulmes J.D. Muzithras V.P. Jones T.R. Gluzman Y. J.

Virol. 1994; 68: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).3,4 It has been proposed that I site cleavage leads to inactivation of the HCMV protease, although direct demonstration of this has been lacking. To further investigate the role of I site cleavage in HCMV protease function, we first introduced mutations at the I site to prevent its cleavage and to stabilize the protease.If I site cleavage inactivates the protease, then elimination of the cleavage site would be predicted to produce an enzyme with greater catalytic stability, as long as the mutations introduced would not significantly alter the catalytic or structural properties of the enzyme. Previous studies have shown that amino acids at the P4-P1′ positions of canonical release and maturation cleavage sites are critical for hydrolysis by herpesvirus proteases(23McCann III, P.J. O'Boyle II, D.R. Deckman I. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 526-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that the P1 and P1′ positions are the least tolerant of amino acid substitutions (23McCann III, P.J. O'Boyle II, D.R. Deckman I. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 526-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 Although the HCMV I site is not highly homologous at each of these positions, its P3 valine and P1 alanine residues are identical with the HCMV maturation site sequence, and the P1′ alanine conforms to the apparent requirement for small amino acid side chains (Ser, Ala, Gly) at P1′.2 Mutations were introduced at the P1 and P1′ positions of the I site in the GST-HCMV protease fusion protein. Constructs were generated with the substitutions A143S, A143V, A143N, A144T, A144V, and A143T + A144T (where each pair of single letter codes represent the wild type alanine and substituted amino acids of the indicated codon, respectively). The mutations were selected for their inhibitory phenotype in an E. coli co-expression assay2 and were biased toward conservative amino acid substitutions to limit the possible disruption of secondary structure. All the substitutions except for A143S introduced amino acid side chains that were larger than the P1 and P1′ alanine residues, with varying degrees of structural similarity.The effect of each mutation was evaluated initially by comparing the stabilities of the mutant fusion proteins expressed in E. coli after affinity purification. High expression levels were observed for all five mutants upon expression in E. coli, and each mutation stabilized the enzyme against I site cleavage (Fig. 1). The efficiency of I site autocleavage over a time course of incubation varied among the mutants with A143T/A144T < A143V < A143N < A144V < A143S < A144T < wild type (Fig. 1). It was not immediately clear, however, whether these mutations reduced I site cleavage by eliminating recognition of the I site, the desired result, or by inadvertantly inactivating the protease. To distinguish between these possibilities, the catalytic activity of each mutant enzyme was measured in vitro using affinity-purified fusion proteins in a quantitative HPLC-based peptide cleavage assay (Fig. 2) and in a recombinant fusion peptide cleavage assay (data not shown). Both assays showed that each mutant catalyzed the hydrolysis of a peptide substrate at a rate comparable to the wild type enzyme (Fig. 2). The various I site mutations, therefore, did not have any effect on enzyme activity, but instead prevented recognition of the I site.Figure 2:I site mutants retain enzyme activity. Initial reaction rates were measured for each I site mutant and wild type HCMV fusion proteases using the mP4-P6′ peptide substrate. The percent conversion of substrate to product was an average of two determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Down"

The palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) oxidizes the CoA esters of straight chain fatty acids and prostaglandins and donates electrons directly to molecular oxygen, thereby producing H2O2. The inducibility of this H2O2-generating ACOX in rat and mouse liver by peroxisome proliferators and the postulated role of the resulting oxidative stress in hepatocarcinogenesis generated interest in characterizing the structure and function of human ACOX. We have constructed a full-length cDNA encoding a 660-amino acid residue human ACOX and produced a catalytically active human ACOX protein at high levels in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells using the baculovirus vector. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the full-length 72-kDa polypeptide (component A) was partially processed into its constituent 51-kDa (component B) and 21-kDa (component C) products, respectively. Recombinant protein (∼20 mg/1 × 109 cells) was purified to homogeneity by a single-step procedure on a nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid affinity column.

The maximal activities for saturated fatty acids were observed with C12-18 substrates. The overexpressed human ACOX protein was identified in the cytoplasm of the insect cells by immunocytochemical staining. Individual expression of either the truncated ACOX 51-kDa (component B) or the 21-kDa (component C) revealed lack of enzyme activity, but co-infection of the insect cells with recombinant viruses expressing components B and C resulted in the formation of an enzymatically active heterodimeric B + C complex which could subsequently be inactivated by dissociating with detergent.

INTRODUCTIONIn animal cells, mitochondria as well as peroxisomes oxidize fatty acids via β-oxidation(1Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this division of labor is not entirely clear, but it appears that ordinary fatty acids up to 18 carbons in length are oxidized mainly by the mitochondrial β-oxidation system, whereas the long and very long chain fatty acids are processed predominantly in peroxisomes(1Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The peroxisomal β-oxidation system consists of three proteins: H2O2-generating fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, enoyl-CoA hydratase/3hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase(2Hashimoto T. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1992; 375: 19-32PubMed Google Scholar, 3Osumi T. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Rat liver contains three forms of peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase: (a) a palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), 1The abbreviations used are: ACOXperoxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)PMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisAcNPVAutographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virusSf9Spodoptera frugiperdam.o.i.mutiplicity of infectionNi-NTAnickelnitrilo-triacetic acidMCADmitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase(s). inducible by peroxisome proliferators, that oxidizes esters of medium, long, and very long chain fatty acids; (b) a noninducible pristanoyl-CoA oxidase, which oxidizes the CoA esters of 2-methyl-branched fatty acids such as pristanic acid; and (c) a noninducible trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase, which oxidizes the CoA esters of bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanoic acids(1Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Among these three oxidases, the inducible ACOX is well characterized and is implicated in the oxidative DNA damage and hepatocarcinogenesis resulting from exposure to peroxisome proliferators(4Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Ui N. J. Biochem. 1980; 87: 1735-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5Reddy J.K. Rao M.S. Vaino H. Magee P.N. McGregor D.B. McMichael A.J.

In contrast to rat, peroxisomes in human liver and kidney contain only two forms of acyl-CoA oxidases, and the first enzyme, ACOX, cross-reacts with polyclonal antibodies raised against the rat enzyme(6Vanhove G.F. Van Veldhoven P.P. Fransen M. Denis S. Eyssen H.J. Wanders R.J.A.W. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10335-10344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CoA esters of 2-methyl branched-chain fatty acids and of bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanic acids are oxidized in human tissues by one single peroxisomal branched-chain acyl-CoA oxidase which does not cross-react with antibodies raised against rat pristanoyl-CoA oxidase (6Vanhove G.F. Van Veldhoven P.P. Fransen M. Denis S. Eyssen H.J. Wanders R.J.A.W. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10335-10344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The highly inducible ACOX of rat and human has a molecular mass of 140 kDa and consists of two subunits of 72 kDa (component A), which can be proteolytically cleaved into 51-kDa (component B), and 21-kDa (component C) products within the peroxisome matrix(3Osumi T. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Previously we have shown that the human ACOX gene is located on chromosome 17q25, spans ∼33 kilobases, consists of 14 exons, and encodes an open reading frame of 660 amino acids(7Varanasi U. Chu R. Chu S. Espinosa R. LeBeau M.M. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3107-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The transcription of the human ACOX gene in liver appears relatively poor when compared to rat(8Aoyama T. Tsushima K. Souri M. Kamijo T. Suzuki Y. Shimozawa N. Orri T. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophs. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The human ACOX gene exhibits several large transcripts in the liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle whose significance remains unclear(7Varanasi U. Chu R. Chu S. Espinosa R. LeBeau M.M. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3107-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In normal human liver, the acyl-CoA oxidase activity is only one-fifth of that reported in rat liver(9Bronfman M. Inestrosa N.C. Leighton F. Biochem. Biophs. Res. Commun. 1979; 88: 1030-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). So far, the human acyl-CoA oxidase has been only partially purified. Since liver homogenates invariably contain branched-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity, reliable estimations of Km values are not possible by assaying partially purified preparations(10Casteels M. Schepers L. van Veldhoven P.P. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Lipid. Res. 1990; 31: 1865-1872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural and functional characterization of human ACOX is essential in view of the role of this enzyme in oxidative stress caused by the sustained induction of peroxisome proliferation in liver and its potential role in a peroxisomal deficiency disorder designated pseudo-neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (characterized by the absence of ACOX resulting in the impaired degradation of very long chain fatty acids)(11Poll-The B.T. Roels F. Ogier H. Scotto J. Vamecq J. Schitgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. van Roermund C.W.T. van Wijland M.J.A. Schram A.W. Tager J.M. Saudubray J.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1988; 42: 422-434PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in other peroxisomal genetic disorders such as Zellweger and Zellweger-like syndromes, the translated ACOX protein is not processed into the 52- and 21-kDa subunits(12Suzuki Y. Shimozawa N. Orii T. Igarashi N. Kono N. Hashimoto T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 172: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A novel subtype of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency with detectable protein has been reported recently(13Suzuki Y. Shimozawa N. Yajima S. Tomatsu S. Kondo N. Nakaga Y. Akaboshi S. Lai M. Tanabe Y. Hashimoto T. Wanders R.A. Schutgens R.B.H. Moser H.W. Orii T. Ann. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the ACOX enzyme properties is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of these peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency disorders and to develop new approaches for clinical therapy.We report here the construction of a full-length human liver ACOX cDNA and the production of relatively large quantities of functionally active recombinant human ACOX by a baculovirus-based expression system. We describe the enzymatic properties of the purified ACOX protein (component A) and also present evidence that ACOX subunits B and C, when expressed separately in insect cells, lack enzyme activity, but when these B + C components are expressed together, they form a heterodimeric complex which exhibits ACOX activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAmplification and Construction of Human ACOX cDNATotal cellular RNA from human liver was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method(14Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16619) Google Scholar). Each of the cDNA fragments was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using a reverse transcriptase RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) and appropriate pairs of primers (Table 1). The reverse transcription mixture was in a volume of 20 μl and contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 90 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.1 μM downstream primer, 1 μg of total RNA, and 5 units of thermostable rTth DNA polymerase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 70°C for 15 min, and then the volume was increased to 100 μl by adding H2O together with 8 μl of 10× chelating buffer, 2 μl of 25 mM MgCl2 solution, and 10 μl of 10 μM upstream primer. The reaction mixture was cycled 35 times, 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 52°C, and 1-2 min at 72°C. Four overlapping DNA fragments (fragment 1, 470 bp; fragment 2, 837 bp; fragment 3, 572 bp; fragment 4, 608 bp) were obtained, respectively, by PCR. Amplified fragments were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis and cloned into pGEMT vector (Promega). For each of the fragments, at least two clones were sequenced, and the one without any artifact was chosen for further experiments. Fragments 1 and 2, with an overlapping region of 202 bp (324-685, type I exon 3 and part of exon 4) were subjected to recombinant PCR with ExpS1 and AS2 primers. The generated fragment 1 + 2 (1161 bp) was cloned into the pGEMT vector. Fragment 3 + 4 (1025-2233) was created by ligation of fragments 3 and 4 using the EcoRV site. The full-length cDNA was obtained by ligating the combined fragments 1 + 2/3 + 4 using the NcoI site at 1045 by partial digestion. The entire full-length cDNA fragment was sequenced with specific primers to confirm its authenticity.Tabled 1Expression of Human ACOX in Sf9 Insect CellsWe initially designed the full-length human ACOX cDNA fragments with restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends that would allow insertion into the baculovirus transfer vector, pVL1392 (Invitrogen), thereby allowing the direct expression of protein in Sf9 cells. The full-length human ACOX cDNA with EcoRI and BamHI sites introduced by PCR primers at the 5′ and 3′ ends was first subcloned into the transfer vector pVL1392(15Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1988; 167: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The construct was then linearized by EcoRI digestion, and an EcoRI site-tailed linker starting with an ATG codon followed by 6 consecutive histidine residues was inserted. The resulting plasmids were sequenced with BV1 primer (16Webb A.C. Bradley M.K. Phelan S.A. Wu J.Q. Gehrke L. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 512-519PubMed Google Scholar). DNA from the colony that contains a single copy of the “6 histidine” affinity tag in the right orientation was used to construct recombinant virus(17Chu R. Usuda N. Reddy M.K. Liu C. Hashimoto T. Alvares K. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K Biochem. Biophs. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The availability of a 6 histidine tag greatly enabled the purification of the protein and circumvented the need for heat treatment and chromatographic procedures. Purification of ACOX was performed by a one-step elution method (see below). The truncated cDNA fragments encoding components B and C were obtained by amplification of the full-length cDNA and subcloned into the pVL1392 vector. The linker sequence encoding the 6 histidines was also inserted into the transfer vectors in front of the coding region of component B and C. The recombinant viruses were obtained by co-transfection of Sf9 insect cells with the transfer vector DNA and linearized wild type AcNPV DNA as reported previously(17Chu R. Usuda N. Reddy M.K. Liu C. Hashimoto T. Alvares K. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K Biochem. Biophs. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the recombinant baculovirus, fragments harboring A, B, and C components with the 6 histidine tag were designated as hisA-NPV, hisB-NPV, and hisC-NPV, respectively. Two recombinant virus expression components B and C without the 6 histidine tag were subsequently constructed and designated as B-NPV and C-NPV, respectively. The purified recombinant virus stocks were used at a mutiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 to infect Sf9 insect cells which were at an 80% confluence in a T-flask or at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in a spinner flask. Cell cultures were maintained at 26°C and were harvested at selected intervals after infection. The expression of full-length or truncated human ACOX was determined by SDS-PAGE, using 10% polyacrylamide gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting(19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 76: 4350-4354Crossref Scopus (44704) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed by employing rabbit anti-rat ACOX antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Bio-Rad) as the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively.Purification of the Recombinant Human ACOXFor a scale-up of full-length ACOX protein production, Sf9 insect cells were maintained in spinner flasks and infected with recombinant virus at a density of 3 × 106 cells/ml. At 72 h postinfection the cells were harvested, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, together with 1 mM PMSF, and lysed by sonication for 5 min. The cell lysates were then pelleted at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and then absorbed to 10 ml of packed Ni-NTA affinity resin on ice for 30 min. The resin was then packaged into a 20-ml syringe column, washed twice with 50 ml of binding buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM PMSF) and with 75 ml of washing buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM PMSF), and once with the same buffer containing 50 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted from the resin using 20 ml of the washing buffer containing 500 mM imidazole, pH 6.0. The eluted fractions containing ACOX were dialyzed against 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mM PMSF overnight at 4°C. The dialyzed ACOX solution was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To purify component B and C protein, monolayer-cultured Sf9 cells were infected with appropriate viruses and harvested at 72 h after infection. The same procedures were employed to package, wash, and elute the Ni-NTA affinity column. The eluted peak fractions were pooled together, concentrated by Centricon-10 (Amicon) spin columns, and used for enzyme activity assay and SDS-PAGE analysis.Enzyme AssayACOX activity was assayed by measuring the palmitoyl-CoA-dependent H2O2 production as described by Osumi et al.(3Osumi T. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was in a total volume of 1.0 ml with the following constituents: 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.82 mM 4-aminoantipyrine, 10.6 mM phenol, 10 μM FAD, 5 IU of horseradish peroxidase, 20 μM palmitoyl-CoA, and the enzyme. The reaction was carried out at 30°C, and the formation of H2O2 was measured by following the increase in absorbance at 500 nM. The molar extinction coefficient was 6,390 M−1 cm−1 at pH 7.4. One unit of the enzyme was defined as the amount which catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of product/min.Other MethodsImmunomorphological procedures were the same as reported previously(20Alvares K.

Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford(21Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar). Plasmid isolation, endonuclease digestion, ligation, and DNA sequencing were performed according to standard protocols(22Sambrook J.M. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).RESULTSConstruction of a Full-length Human ACOX cDNAUsing human liver total cellular RNA as template, four cDNA fragments overlapping the entire coding region of human ACOX were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. The strategy for engineering a cDNA construct encoding the 1980-nucleotide open reading frame of the human ACOX involved joining and ligating together four fragments derived from the PCR products (Fig. 1). Sequencing of the four constituent DNA fragments revealed that it exactly matched the corresponding exonic sequences of the ACOX gene(7Varanasi U. Chu R. Chu S. Espinosa R. LeBeau M.M. Reddy J.K.

Components B and C of ACOX are derived from the full-length protein by a post-translational proteolytic cleavage of component A(3Osumi T.

Chem. 1987; 262: 8131-8137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the human ACOX cDNA encodes for a 660-amino acid residue, due to a missing histidine at amino acid position 651. This could result from either a deletion of a codon in the human or an insertion of a codon into rat ACOX. To exclude the possibility of an amplification or sequencing error, five individual cDNA clones spanning exons 10-14 (7Varanasi U. Chu R. Chu S. Espinosa R. LeBeau M.M. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3107-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were checked by sequencing. It was confirmed that the missing codon is not an artifact since all the cDNA clones upon sequencing were identical to the corresponding exonic sequences (Fig. 2).Figure 2:The nucleotide sequence of portions of genomic and cDNA clone of the 14th exon of human ACOX.

Human ACOX encoded by the full-length cDNA is composed of 660 amino acid residues and has a predicted molecular mass of 72 kDa. The final construct had 6 histidines at the N-terminal end. Expression of the full-length cDNA in insect cells revealed a major 72-kDa protein band on SDS-PAGE. This 72-kDa protein increased in a time-dependent manner following infection with recombinant virus (Fig. 3A) and became prominent by 48 h postinfection. Densitometric scanning of the gels showed that this 72-kDa protein accounted for ∼15% of the total cellular protein in Sf9 insect cells 72 h postinfection. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies raised against rat ACOX revealed that the 72-kDa protein is the predominant immunoactive protein in insect cell lysates. Besides the 72-kDa band, two other bands with lower molecular masses of 51 and 21 kDa were also recognized (Fig. 3B). The 72-, 51-, and 21-kDa immunoactive bands correspond to components A, B, and C of human liver ACOX, respectively. Thus, human ACOX expressed in insect cells exhibited a pattern similar to that of rat ACOX(17Chu R. Usuda N. Reddy M.K. Liu C. Hashimoto T. Alvares K. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K Biochem. Biophs. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fig. 3C shows the time course of the ACOX activity in Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant virus. ACOX activity increased from 24 h postinfection until peak levels of enzyme activity were found at 72 h postinfection. The time course of increase in ACOX activity correlated well with the increase in the amount of protein detected on SDS-PAGE. The specific activity was 0.9 unit/mg of protein at the peak level of expression.Figure 3:Analysis of human ACOX expressed in Sf9 insect cells. Panel A, SDS-PAGE analysis of whole cell lysates of Sf9 insect cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus containing full-length coding sequence of human ACOX cDNA. Cells, grown in monolayer culture, at 80% confluence were infected with the recombinant virus and harvested at the indicated time (hr) after infection. Cell lysates (75 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Panel B, immunoblot analysis of recombinant human ACOX expressed in Sf9 insect cells. The cell extracts were prepared (as in panel A) and processed for immunoblotting using antibodies raised against rat liver ACOX. Arrowheads indicate the position of components A (72 kDa), B (51 kDa), and C (21 kDa). Panel C, time course of expression of human ACOX activity in Sf9 insect cells infected with the recombinant virus. Cells were infected and harvested as described for Panel A and assayed for ACOX activity. The values are expressed as the average of two assays. Panel D, the recombinant human ACOX purified from Sf9 insect cell lysates infected for 72 h. The histidine-tagged human ACOX expressed in Sf9 insect cells was purified on a Ni-NTA affinity column. The purified protein (5 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Lane M represents molecular mass standards (values in kilodaltons) in Panels A and D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recombinant human ACOX was purified by a single-step procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3D, a major 72-kDa band was eluted at 500 mM imidazole. The bands of lower molecular masses of 51 and 21 kDa could be visualized only by silver staining (data not shown). The low ratio of the component B and C cleaved from component A in insect cells limited the yield of lower molecular mass components B and C of ACOX. Using this purification procedure, about 20 mg of pure human ACOX was obtained from 1 liter of Sf9 insect cell suspension culture (1 × 109 cells) which is two times greater than the yield of recombinant rat ACOX purified from Sf9 insect cells by the “heating method” described elsewhere(3Osumi T. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Estimation of Apparent Km Value for the Human ACOXSamples (5 μg) of the purified human recombinant ACOX were incubated with increasing concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At a low concentration of palmitoyl-CoA (2-10 μM), the enzymatic activity increased linearly with an increasing substrate concentration. The highest specific activity was 0.95 unit/mg of protein at 15 μM palmitoyl-CoA. Nevertheless, at a high concentration of palmitoyl-CoA, there was substrate inhibition. The specific activity decreased to 0.25 unit/mg of protein when the concentration of palmitoyl-CoA increased to 50 μM. From the linear parts of the Lineweaver-Burk plots (not illustrated) an apparent Km of 10 μM and Vmax of 1.4 units/mg of protein were calculated for palmitoyl-CoA. The Km of purified human ACOX is similar to that of the purified rat enzyme, but much lower than that reported (62 μM) for the crude enzyme of human liver (10Casteels M. Schepers L. van Veldhoven P.P. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Lipid. Res. 1990; 31: 1865-1872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that ACOX contains FAD as a prosthetic group(4Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Ui N. J. Biochem. 1980; 87: 1735-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), omission of FAD from the reaction mixture did not affect the enzyme activity and kinetic properties (data not shown).Chain Length SpecificityThe substrate specificity of human ACOX was examined with 50 μg of crude Sf9 insect cell extracts infected with hisA-NPV and 5 μg of protein of the purified enzyme. 10 μM octanoyl CoA (C8), decanoyl-CoA (C10), lauroyl-CoA (C12), myristoyl-CoA (C14), palmitoyl-CoA (C16), and stearoyl-CoA (C18) were used as substrates for the assay. Maximal activities for saturated fatty acids were observed with C12-18 substrates. The specific activities toward C12-C18 were 0.07-0.1 unit/mg of protein for crude extract and 0.85-0.95 unit/mg of protein for the purified enzyme. The activity toward C8 and C10 was less than 40% of that toward C16 acyl-CoA. Since ACOX is the first enzyme of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway, the lack of short chain acyl-CoA oxidase activity of ACOX led to the conclusion that human peroxisomes predominantly, if not exclusively, oxidize very long chain acyl-CoAs.Localization of Recombinant Human ACOX in Sf9 Insect CellsIn normal human liver, ACOX is localized exclusively within the peroxisomal matrix(24Santos M.J. Hoeffler S. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal (Ser-Lye-Leu, or a conservative variant such as Ser-Arg-Leu) located at the C terminus of a majority of peroxisomal proteins, including ACOX, that targets proteins to peroxisomes has been identified(25Miyazawa S.

The synthesized precursor polypeptide of AGA is rapidly activated in the endoplasmic reticulum by proteolysis into two subunits. Expression of the α- and β-subunits of AGA in separate cDNA constructs showed that independently folded subunits totally lack enzyme activity, and even when co-expressed in vitro they fail to produce an active heterodimer of the enzyme. Both of the subunits are required for the enzyme activity, and the immediate interaction of the subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum is necessary for the correct folding of the dimeric enzyme molecule. The specific amino acid residues essential for the active site of the AGA enzyme were further analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro expression of mutagenized constructs. Replacement of Thr206, the most amino-terminal residue of the β-subunit, with Ser resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity without influencing intracellular processing or transport of the mutant polypeptide to the lysosomes. Analogously, replacement of the most amino-terminal tryptophan, Trp34 with Phe or Ser in the α-subunit, resulted in a totally inactive enzyme without influencing the intracellular processing or stability of the polypeptide. These results suggest that the catalytic center of this amidase is formed by the interaction of the amino-terminal parts of two subunits and requires both Trp34 in the α-subunit and Thr206 in the β-subunit.

Aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA, 1The abbreviations used are: AGAaspartylglucosaminidaseAGUaspartylglucosaminuriaPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisERendoplasmic reticulum. EC 3.5.1.26) is a lysosomal hydrolase that catalyzes one of the final steps in the degradation of glycoproteins. AGA hydrolyzes the N-glycosidic linkage between asparagine and N-acetylglucosamine and requires the presence of both free carboxyl and amino groups on the asparagine, whereas the requirements of the carbohydrate chain are less strict(1Makino M. Kojima T. Ohgushi T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1968; 63: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Human AGA is synthesized as an inactive 42-kDa precursor, which is processed into two subunits immediately after removal of the signal peptide. This rapid proteolytic cleavage into the 27-kDa pro-α- and 17-kDa β-subunits is also the activation step of the enzyme and takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum(2Ikonen E. Julkunen I. Tollersrud O-K. Kalkkinen N. Peltonen L. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The dimeric AGA molecule is transported to the lysosomes, most probably via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor pathway, although recent evidence also suggests the existence of an alternative transport pathway(3Tikkanen R. Enomaa N. Riikonen A. Ikonen E. Peltonen L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The third maturation step of the AGA polypeptide takes place in the lysosomes and involves a specific removal of 10 amino acids from the C-terminal end of the pro-α-subunit and does not influence enzyme activity(2Ikonen E. Julkunen I. Tollersrud O-K. Kalkkinen N. Peltonen L. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that the β-subunit is also processed in lysosomes, but the nature of this processing step is so far unknown(3Tikkanen R. Enomaa N. Riikonen A. Ikonen E. Peltonen L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The mature AGA enzyme is a heterodimer consisting of 24-kDa α- and 17-kDa β-subunits, which are both heterogeneously glycosylated and associated by noncovalent interactions(2Ikonen E. Julkunen I.

Rouvinen, N. Kalkkinen, and L. Peltonen, unpublished observation. Consequently, as a complementary strategy, other approaches must be taken to determine the functionally essential domains of the polypeptide chain. Characterization of the active site is important for understanding the function of this unique lysosomal amidase in molecular detail, and this knowledge might be of use in the treatment of AGU patients. Here we have used in vitro expression of mutagenized AGA cDNA constructs to analyze the role of the subunits and specific amino acid residues of AGA. These results emphasize the necessity of the immediate interaction of α- and β-subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and stress the significance of specific amino acids in the amino-terminal parts of the subunits for the formation of the catalytic center of this lysosomal amidase. The measurement of AGA activity was based on a colorimetric enzyme assay(12Makino M. Kojima T. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 24: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cell lysate from approximately 105 cells was diluted to a final volume of 50 μl with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.1. To this reaction 100 nmol of the synthetic substrate 2-acetamido-1-β-(L-aspartamido)-1,2-dideoxy-β-D-glucose (Sigma) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding 107 μl of 0.8 M borate buffer, pH 8.8, and heating the samples at 100°C for 3 min. 1 ml of Ehrlich's reagent (0.1 g of 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, 10 ml of 17.3 M acetic acid, 50 μl of 11.6 M HCl) was added, and the reaction mixture was further incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 545 nm. The amount of protein in the samples was determined using the Bio-Rad microprotein assay. One catalytic enzyme unit was defined as the amount of the enzyme required to liberate 1 μmol of GlcNAc in 1 min at 37°C. A full-length AGA cDNA in M13 mp18 (13Ikonen E. Baumann M. Grön K. Syvänen A-C. Enomaa N. Halila R. Aula P. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was used as a single-stranded template for site-directed mutagenesis, which was performed using the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system kit produced by Amersham (United Kingdom). The mutated AGA cDNAs were excised from the M13 vector with BamHI and further subcloned into the BamHI site of the expression vector SVpoly(14Stacey A. Schnieke A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The correct orientation of the inserted DNA was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. The mutated clones were sequenced to confirm that no undesired additional mutations had been introduced. For the vaccinia/T7 polymerase expression, the wild-type AGA cDNA and the cDNAs encoding the α- and β-subunits were inserted into the pGem 7z vector. DNAs coding for the α- and β-subunits were prepared by polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified signal sequence of AGA was inserted 5′ to the β-subunit. These cDNA constructs were also inserted into SVpoly vector for the COS-1 expression. The correct sequences of the subunit clones were confirmed by sequencing. AGA cDNA constructs were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, which were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. 3 μg of plasmid-cDNA construct was transfected into the cells grown to 60-80% confluency in 3-cm cell culture dishes. Transfection was performed using the liposome transfection method (15Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4388) Google Scholar) (Lipofectin Reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were labeled with radioactive cysteine and immunoprecipitated as described previously by Riikonen et al.(16Riikonen A. Ikonen E. Sormunen R. Lehto V-P. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The precipitated proteins were separated by 14% SDS-PAGE(17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and the radioactive bands were visualized by fluorography using the Amplify reagent (Amersham). AGA cDNA construct and the separate constructs of α- and βsubunits were transfected into HeLa cells 1 h post-infection with vaccinia/T7 virus, essentially as described by Ausubel et al.(18Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). Sixteen hours after transfection the cells were labeled with radioactive cysteine for 4 h. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed as above. The role of the α- and β-subunits in the enzyme activity of AGA was studied in HeLa cells using the vaccinia/T7 polymerase expression system. Each of the cell lines transfected with the cDNA construct containing the coding sequence for either the α- or β-subunit expressed a polypeptide, which in metabolic labeling experiments was of the correct size (Fig. 1) but lacked the AGA enzyme activity (Fig. 2). Cells transfected with the full-length AGA cDNA or co-transfected with the cDNA constructs of the α- and β-subunits expressed both the pro-α- (27-kDa) and the β-subunit (17-kDa) (Fig. 1), a polypeptide composition that is active if the heterodimeric molecule is correctly folded(2Ikonen E. Julkunen I. Tollersrud O-K. Kalkkinen N. Peltonen L. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, only the cells transfected with the full-length cDNA construct displayed enzyme activity, whereas the enzyme activity of the co-transfected cells did not exceed the background level, suggesting a failure in the correct folding of the heterodimeric enzyme molecule (Fig. 2). This was further indicated by the SDS-PAGE analyses of nondenatured polypeptides, which showed that the two subunits remained separate in the co-transfected cells, and no signal was observed in the position of the 42-kDa heterodimeric molecule (data not shown).Figure 2:The specific AGA activities from different expression studies. A colorimetric assay was used to measure AGA activity from the lysates of COS-1 cells and HeLa-cells (indicated with an asterisk) expressing different AGA cDNA constructs. One catalytic unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to liberate 1 μmol of GlcNAc in 1 min at 37°C from the synthetic substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The two characteristic processing steps of the AGA polypeptide, the activation cleavage occurring in the ER and the trimming of 10 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the α-subunit taking place in the lysosomes, facilitated monitoring of the intracellular maturation and transport of the AGA polypeptides. In this expression system, the final lysosomal processing of the enzyme was not observed even in the case of wild-type AGA. This is probably because of high overexpression of AGA, which leads to accumulation of the polypeptides in the ER and largely blocks the secretory pathway. A smaller form of the β-subunit observed with the separate expression of the β-subunit most probably represents a nonglycosylated form of this subunit (Fig. 1), based on the size of the polypeptide corresponding exactly to the size of the nonglycosylated βsubunit (3Tikkanen R. Enomaa N. Riikonen A. Ikonen E. Peltonen L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and on the fact that the relative amount of the smaller polypeptide did not increase during long chase times, indicating that the polypeptide could not represent a processing or a degradation product. To study the intracellular stability and folding of the α- and β-subunits, we also expressed the separate cDNA constructs transiently in COS-1 cells. Metabolic labeling of the transfected cells showed that both of the subunits were expressed separately but that the intracellular stability of these polypeptides was reduced. The polypeptides of the different subunits were gradually degraded, and 24 h after the radioactive pulse the signals of the polypeptides were no longer detectable. However, both of the subunits were fully glycosylated, which was demonstrated by expressing the AGA cDNA constructs containing mutated N-glycosylation site in one or both of the subunits(3Tikkanen R. Enomaa N. Riikonen A. Ikonen E. Peltonen L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The lysosomal processing step of the glycosylated subunits was not observed, indicating that the individual polypeptides were not transported to the lysosomes (Fig. 3). However, immunofluorescence analysis of the transfected cells suggested that a minor portion of the β-subunit could be transported to lysosomes, whereas the α-subunit remained in the ER (data not shown). The conformation of the separately expressed polypeptides was studied by immunoprecipitation with different antibodies. Antibody against the native AGA enzyme efficiently precipitated the separately expressed β-subunit (Fig. 3A), whereas α-subunit could be precipitated only with the antibody against the denatured form of the subunit (Fig. 3B). These findings suggest that the conformation of the β-subunit was close to normal, whereas the α-subunit failed to attain the conformation of the native enzyme. It has been earlier suggested that the first amino acid residue of the β-subunit, Thr206, has an important role in the activity of AGA(11Kaartinen V. Williams J.C. Tomich J. Yates III, J.R. Hood L.E. Mononen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5860-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fisher K.J. Klein M. Park H. Vettese M.B. Aronson N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To dissect the role of this residue in more detail, we mutagenized Thr206 to Ser by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed this mutant polypeptide transiently in COS-1 cells. The measured AGA activity of the cells expressing the mutant polypeptide was found to be reduced to the background level (Fig. 2). To verify that the lack of enzyme activity was not a consequence of intracellular degradation or altered transport of the AGA polypeptide, we monitored the processing of the mutated polypeptide by pulse-chase experiments. To compare the normally processed AGA polypeptide and polypeptide with known processing abnormalities, we expressed in COS-1 cells both wild-type AGA and the AGA polypeptide carrying the most common disease-causing mutation, AGUFin. The AGUFin double mutation (R161Q,C163S) is known to disturb the correct folding of the AGA polypeptide, resulting in the accumulation of the precursor molecule in the ER(13Ikonen E. Baumann M. Grön K. Syvänen A-C. Enomaa N. Halila R. Aula P. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Riikonen A. Ikonen E. Sormunen R. Lehto V-P. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Ikonen E. Enomaa N. Ulmanen I. Peltonen L. Genomics. 1991; 11: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The metabolically labeled polypeptides were immunoprecipitated from COS cell lysates at different chase times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The intracellular processing of the mutated T206S polypeptide was found to follow exactly the same processing pathway as wild-type AGA. The processing of the T206S polypeptide showed no accumulation of the precursor molecule, which characteristically was observed in the case of the polypeptide carrying the AGUFin mutation (Fig. 4). A range of different group-specific chemical modifiers were tested for their effect on the catalytic activity of AGA. An efficient inactivation of enzyme activity was observed only with N-bromosuccinimide, which modifies tryptophan residues in the acidic pH range highly selectively(21Spande T.F. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 498-522Crossref Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Based on this primary observation we used site-directed mutagenesis to change the four Trp residues of AGA polypeptide, all located in the α-subunit, to find out which one(s) might be involved in the catalytic function. In the mutagenized constructs the Trp was replaced by the Phe residue, since this amino acid resembles the bulky Trp with an aromatic ring structure and could be expected to retain a similar structure in the polypeptide. The mutated polypeptides were then separately expressed in COS-1 cells. The replacement of the Trp residue at position 34 resulted in a totally inactive enzyme, whereas the other three polypeptides mutated at different Trp residues (W44F, W158F, and W168F) had an enzyme activity comparable with that of the wild-type AGA (Fig. 2). The intracellular processing and transport of different Trp-mutagenized AGA polypeptides were monitored using metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation of the labeled polypeptides. When the radiolabeled polypeptides of the wild-type AGA were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE after a 1-h chase period, the activation cleavage into two subunits was already completed. After chasing for 3 h, the processing of the α-subunit into the mature, 24-kDa lysosomal form could be observed, and this lysosomal processing step was completed after chasing the cells for 6-7 h. In the case of three Trp-mutagenized polypeptides with wild-type enzyme activity (W44F, W158F, and W168F), the proteolytic maturation was comparable with that of wild-type AGA (Fig. 5), whereas in the case of the mutant polypeptide carrying the W34F substitution the first processing step into α- and βsubunits did occur but was somewhat delayed (Fig. 6).Figure 6:Intracellular processing of the Trp34-mutated AGA polypeptides with reduced enzyme activity. Cells expressing wild-type AGA and both of the Trp34-mutated polypeptides were pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 1 h and chased for 1, 3, and 7 h. The radiolabeled AGA polypeptides were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates, and the samples were analyzed on 14% SDS-PAGE. Anti-AGA represents an expression construct, in which the AGA cDNA is cloned in antisense orientation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze the role of Trp34 in more detail, we produced another mutagenized construct by replacing Trp34 with Ser. This mutation also completely inactivated the enzyme. The intracellular processing of both the inactive Trp mutants, W34F and W34S, was then monitored to ensure that the lack of enzyme activity was not a consequence of secondary events such as incomplete proteolytic activation in the ER or early intracellular degradation. The processing of the wild type and two Trp34-mutagenized AGA polypeptides was followed by chasing the labeled polypeptides for 1, 3, and 7 h. Immediately after the pulse period, a detectable amount of the mutated polypeptides was normally processed into subunits, but a somewhat higher amount of the uncleaved precursor molecules was observed than in the case of the wild-type constructs. However, after chasing for 7 h, the processing of both Trp34-mutated polypeptides reached the normal processing level, and no abnormal accumulation of the precursor was observed (Fig. 6). When the radioactive signals of the electrophoresed polypeptides were quantitated by scanning, the total amounts of the α- and β-subunits were similar both in the cells transfected with the wild type and the Trp34 mutants. This indicates that although the replacement of Trp34 with another amino acid resulted in a small delay in the early processing step, the mutant precursor was completely cleaved into the α- and β-subunits rather than degraded in the ER. To study the amino terminus of the α-subunit in more detail and to verify that the loss of the enzyme activity associated with Trp34-mutagenized constructs was not a secondary consequence of misfolding of the amino-terminal part of the αsubunit, we mutagenized two additional amino acids from this region. The first amino acid of the α-subunit, Ser24 was replaced with Thr to study whether the whole amino terminus is needed in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Also, to study if the region near the Thr34 is structurally so important that the change of one amino acid may dramatically drop the enzyme activity, we also replaced Thr34 with Ser. When these mutagenized cDNA constructs were expressed in COS-1 cells, they were found to have wild-type enzyme activity (Fig. 2). The intracellular processing of the polypeptides was also comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 7). Lack of AGA enzyme activity leads to AGU disease, which is the most common disorder associated with the failure of the degradation of Asn-linked glycoproteins in lysosomes. Although the intracellular maturation and the proteolytic processing of AGA have earlier been described by us(2Ikonen E. Julkunen I. Tollersrud O-K. Kalkkinen N. Peltonen L. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the events leading to the formation of the catalytic center of AGA have not been well characterized. In this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro expression of specific cDNA constructs as an approach to clarify the roles of α- and β-subunits of AGA for the enzyme activity and to localize key amino acid residues, essential for the biological function of this enzyme. The activation of AGA requires an early proteolytic cleavage of the precursor molecule. The maturation of the enzyme is continued in the lysosomes, where 10 amino acids are removed from the C-terminal end of the pro-α-subunit and the β-subunit faces an as yet unknown processing step. However, the heterodimer of AGA, which contains the pro-α/β-subunit structure is already fully active, and the lysosomal processing of the α-subunit does not influence the enzyme activity(2Ikonen E. Julkunen I. Tollersrud O-K. Kalkkinen N. Peltonen L. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We studied whether the translation of subunits from a continuous mRNA is a prerequisite for the formation of the dimeric enzyme structure and to what extent the separate subunits contribute to the enzyme activity. In vitro expression of separate cDNAs of the α- or β-subunits both in vaccinia/T7 polymerase expression system and in COS-1 cells showed that neither of the subunits alone can be active. Furthermore, co-expression of the subunit constructs showed that independent folding of the two subunits prevents formation of the catalytically active dimeric molecule. This contrasts, for example, with another lysosomal enzyme, β-hexosaminidase, which is also a heterodimer but coded from two different genes. Co-expression of the separate subunits of β-hexosaminidase results in a fully active enzyme molecule (22Brown C.A. Mahuran D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 497-508PubMed Google Scholar) unlike in the case of AGA. This suggests that the formation of the correct quaternary structure of the AGA enzyme requires immediate interaction and coordinated folding of the newly translated and proteolytically released α- and β-subunits into a dimeric enzyme molecule. Kaartinen et al.(11Kaartinen V. Williams J.C. Tomich J. Yates III, J.R. Hood L.E. Mononen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5860-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported the inhibitory effect of the chemical inhibitor 5-diazo-4-oxo-L-norvaline on the enzyme activity of AGA. 5-Diazo-4-oxo-L-norvaline is bound to the hydroxyl group of the first Thr of the β-subunit through an α-ketone ether linkage, which was shown to effectively inhibit AGA activity. This inhibition was protected by a natural substrate, providing evidence that the most amino-terminal residue of the β-subunit, Thr206, is located near or at the active site of the AGA enzyme. However, recent data by Fisher et al.(19Fisher K.J. Klein M. Park H. Vettese M.B. Aronson N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have suggested that the substitution of Thr206 by Ala interferes with the correct processing of the AGA precursor into the subunits. These observations encouraged us to investigate the role of Thr206 in more detail in our expression system. As expected, the expression of the Thr-mutagenized AGA cDNA in COS-1 cells revealed drastically reduced enzyme activity, not exceeding the background level. Furthermore, when the intracellular transport and the proteolytic maturation of the mutated polypeptide were monitored in pulse-chase experiments, no difference was observed between the wild-type AGA and the mutant polypeptide. To confirm that our expression system did not favor the processing of the mutant polypeptides, we also expressed the polypeptide carrying the AGUFin mutation, known to result in the accumulation of the precursor molecule in the ER and defective proteolytic processing of the polypeptide(16Riikonen A. Ikonen E. Sormunen R. Lehto V-P. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Ikonen E. Enomaa N. Ulmanen I. Peltonen L. Genomics. 1991; 11: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The processing of the AGUFin polypeptide into subunits was completely blocked, but contrary to previous data (19Fisher K.J. Klein M. Park H. Vettese M.B. Aronson N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) we could not observe any aberration from the normal maturation pathway in the AGA polypeptides carrying the amino acid change at position 206. The observation that the replacement of Thr206 by Ser inactivates the enzyme but does not influence the normal processing or transport of the polypeptide provides further evidence that Thr206 is located close to or at the active site of the AGA enzyme and most probably participates in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. The first amino acid of the β-subunit is necessary for the catalytic activity of AGA, whereas the corresponding region of the α-subunit seems to locate few amino acids apart from the amino terminus. The change of the first amino acid of the α-subunit did not have any influence on either the enzyme activity or the intracellular processing. The significance of Trp residues for the catalytic function of the AGA enzyme was first suggested when the chemical modifier N-bromosuccinimide was found to effectively inhibit the activity of the enzyme. All four Trp residues of AGA are located in the α-subunit, but none of them are adjacent to the proteolytic cleavage sites involved in the intracellular processing of the polypeptide chain (2Ikonen E. Julkunen I. Tollersrud O-K. Kalkkinen N. Peltonen L. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the polypeptides carrying an amino acid other than Trp at position 34 were found to totally lack AGA activity, whereas the change of any other Trp did not influence enzyme activity. Several lines of evidence indicate that Trp34 truly represents an active site residue. First, the normal processing (although with some delay) of the mutated polypeptides was observed, and the lysosomal maturation of the enzyme was found to occur normally. Second, the relative amount of the Trp34-mutagenized subunits was equal to that of wild-type AGA, indicating that the disappearance of the precursor molecules was not a consequence of intracellular degradation in the ER. Third, the region near the Trp34 does not seem to be structurally sensitive for other amino acid changes since the replacement of Thr33 with Ser did not affect activity or the maturation of the enzyme. If the observed decrease in the processing rate of the Trp34-mutagenized precursor polypeptides resulted in a loss of enzyme activity, the activity should be restored when the normal processing of the enzyme is established. All of these data together strongly suggest that Trp34 has a role in substrate binding and/or stabilizing the structure of the catalytic center of the AGA enzyme. This is also supported by the general observation that the binding site grooves of several enzymes interacting with substrates that contain oligosaccharides are stabilized by stacking interactions of aromatic residues and most often by Trp(23Vyas N.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 732-740Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The data provided here emphasize the importance of the amino-terminal parts of both the α- and β-subunits of AGA for the formation of the active site. These regions of AGA subunits are phylogenetically well conserved, and the highly conserved amino acids include Trp34 and Thr206(24Tollersrud O.K. Aronson N. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The significance of the amino-terminal parts of the subunits is further supported by the fact that none of the naturally occurring AGU mutations have been reported in these regions. Disease mutations typically disturb the folding and stability of the AGA enzyme but seemingly skip the active site(25Ikonen E. Aula P. Grön K. Tollersrud O. Halila R. Manninen T. Syvänen A-C. Peltonen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11222-11226Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We conclude that during the formation of the higher order structure of the AGA enzyme, the α- and β-subunits fold in the ER in a coordinated and interactive manner, which brings the amino-terminal parts of the subunits into the immediate vicinity of each other to form the catalytic center of this amidase.

Of specific importance to each of these phases of the virus life cycle is the N-terminal 17-kDa MA domain of p55 or its corresponding proteolytic fragment, p17. The MA protein exhibits unique structural and functional properties depending upon the phase of the virus life cycle. For example, the MA domain provides the signal for the cotranslational N-myristoylation of p55 on its N-terminal glycine(13Göttlinger H.G. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

N-Myristoylation and gag polypeptide sequence(s) outside of the matrix domain (16Biemans R. Thines D. Gheysen D. Rutgers T. Cabezon T. AIDS (Phila.). 1992; 6: 541-546PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to be essential for p55 membrane association and for the ensuing events involved in viral particle assembly(14Bryant M. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). During this assembly process, sequences within the N-terminal 100 residues of the MA domain are also required for recruitment of the viral envelope glycoprotein into the assembled virion(10Yu X. Yuan X. Matsuda Z. Lee T.-H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dorfman T. Mammano F. Haseltine W.A. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent maturation involves release of the MA domain by a virally encoded protease and association of the resulting p17 fragment with the inner virus envelope by an unknown mechanism(7Gelderblom H.R.

With each new round of infection, the karyophilic properties of the prerequisite viral preintegration complex have been ascribed to a basic domain covering amino acids 25-33 of p17(6Yu X. Yu Q.-C.

Thus, the participation of the MA protein in several different aspects of virus development is driven by primary sequence and tertiary structural features that sequentially become manifest at successive stages of virus formation. The functional consequences of these MA protein-driven processes also depend upon the timely presence of both viral and cellular components, which provide a necessary structural environment for the progress of virus development; and it is likely that one or more of these steps are susceptible to independent regulation by the host cell. We have previously demonstrated that HIV gag proteins are phosphorylated in vivo by PKC and have identified a prospective PKC phosphorylation site motif at Ser111 within the MA domain of p55 that is highly conserved among all strains of HIV-1(19Myers G. Berzofsky J.A. Rabson A.B. Smith T.F. Wong-Staal F. Human Retroviruses and AIDS. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1990Google Scholar, 20Burnette B. Yu G. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8698-8703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of this sequence implies that PKC phosphorylation may play a role in regulating the function of p55 and p17. In this report, we have expressed the N-terminal 17-kDa MA domain of HIV-1 p55 (i.e. p17) to determine the functional consequences of gag protein phosphorylation. Activation of PKC with PMA in cells expressing p17 resulted in the reversible translocation of p17 from the cytosol to the membrane fraction. In addition, p17 membrane association was specifically mediated by both the phosphorylation of Ser111 by PKC and N-myristoylation. The identification of this new membrane targeting signal provides an interesting clue into cellular mechanisms that may regulate the function of HIV gag proteins during virus replication. [32P]Phosphoric acid (8500-9120 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [9,10-3H]myristic acid (10-60 Ci/mmol), and mAb NEA-9282 specific to HIV p17 were purchased from DuPont NEN. PMA was obtained from Sigma. p17-specific pAb was purchased from International Enzymes, Inc. (Fallbrook, CA). The Lipofectin transfection system was from Life Technologies, Inc. COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 40 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), and 0.1 mM sodium pyruvate. The p17 coding sequence used for all constructs consisted of the 396-base pair 5′-sequence of HXB2 encoding the MA domain of the gag gene (nucleotides 333-729)(21Ratner L. Fisher A. Jagodzinski L.L. Mitsuya H. Liou R.-S. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1987; 3: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The sequence was obtained by polymerase chain reaction with Taq polymerase (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6821) Google Scholar) by introducing a TGA stop codon after codon 132 using the forward (GCGCGATGGGTGCGAGAGCGTCA) and reverse (GCGCGCTCAGTAATTTTGGCTGAC) oligodeoxynucleotide primers. Expression vector pcDL17 was constructed by cloning the 396-base pair p17 sequence into the BamHI site of pcDL-SRα396 containing the SV40 promoter and human T lymphotropic virus type 1 long terminal repeat(23Takebe Y. Motoharu S. Fujisawa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pcDL17ala2 containing the p17 Gly2→ Ala mutation was produced by polymerase chain reaction using a 24-mer synthetic oligonucleotide (GGGCCCATGGCTGCGAGAGCGTCA) as the forward primer. Plasmid pcDL17ala111 was constructed similarly, except that the Ser111→ Ala mutation was introduced using an 84-mer synthetic oligonucleotide (GCGCGCTCAGTAATTTTGGCTGACCTGATTGCTGTGTCCTGTGTCAGCTGCTGCTTGCTGTGCTTTTTTCTTAGCTTTGTTTTG) as the reverse primer. The coding sequences of all three constructs were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing procedure of Sanger et al.(24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52602) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells on 100-mm dishes were grown to 80% confluency and transfected with 10 μg of plasmid by Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 30 min with 10 ml of phosphate-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) before adding 0.25 mCi/ml [32P]phosphoric acid for 4 h. In some experiments, 100 nM PMA was added during the last 10 min of radiolabeling. Total cell extracts were prepared by scraping and washing cells in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution, extracting with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 10 mM NaF, and protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 28 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 70 μg/ml L-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone)) by five passages through a 21-gauge needle, and clarifying by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Myristoylation was determined by metabolic radiolabeling of cells for 4 h with 250 μCi/ml [9,10-3H]myristic acid 48 h after transfection. 48 h after transfection, COS-7 cells were washed, scraped, and suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors); incubated on ice for 10 min; homogenized with 20 strokes of a glass Dounce homogenizer; and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C to yield the nuclear fraction. The nuclear fraction was then suspended in 200 μl of extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) containing 20% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors), and 4 M KCl was added to a final concentration of 0.3 M(25Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). The final suspension was rocked for 30 min at 4°C and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min to yield the nuclear fraction. The 500 × g post-nuclear supernatant fraction was further fractionated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) containing 0.5 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM EDTA; clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C; and designated as the membrane fraction. The corresponding 100,000 × g supernatant fraction was designated as the cytosolic fraction. Immunoprecipitation was carried out on the membrane and cytosolic fractions or cell extracts from [32P]phosphoric acid- or [9,10-3H]myristic acid-labeled cells by adding 10 μg of anti-p17 pAb and incubating overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by the addition of 50 μl of protein G-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubation at 4°C for 1-2 h. The agarose beads were then pelleted and washed five times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were suspended in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using Daiichi 10-20% gradient gels (Integrated Separation Systems, Natick, MA) (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206983) Google Scholar). Gels were treated with ENHANCE (DuPont NEN) before drying to detect tritium by fluorography. Radiophosphorylated proteins were detected on dried gels by autoradiography and were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For immunoblotting, total nuclear, membrane, and cytosolic fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted using the p17-specific mAb in 5% milk, and visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp.). We have previously reported that p55 and p17 are phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by PKC(20Burnette B. Yu G. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8698-8703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, since those earlier experiments were performed with a recombinant vaccinia vector containing the HIV gag-pol genes and expressing both p55 and its mature proteolytic products, we could not be certain whether p17 was directly phosphorylated by PKC or that p17 phosphorylation arose indirectly via the proteolytic processing of phosphorylated p55. To determine if pre-existing p17 is directly phosphorylated by PKC, COS-7 cells were transfected with a plasmid (pcDL17wt) expressing the MA domain of p55, and after 48 h, the transfected cells were radiolabeled with [32P]phosphoric acid for 4 h and treated with PMA for 8 min. Following PMA treatment, cell extracts were prepared from untreated and PMA-treated cells, and p17 was radioimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 1). PMA treatment resulted in a 4-5-fold increase in the phosphorylation of p17wt immunoprecipitated from stimulated cells (Fig. 1A, lanes1 and 2). This difference was observed even though equal amounts of the p17 proteins were expressed in both lanes as revealed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B, lanes1 and 2). These results confirm our earlier report that activation of PKC in cells after PMA treatment resulted in a stimulation of gag protein phosphorylation (20Burnette B. Yu G. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8698-8703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also extend this observation by demonstrating a direct stimulation of p17 phosphorylation even in the absence of p55. Therefore, these data raise the possibility that external cellular activation signals could have post-translational stimulatory effects on HIV replication though phosphorylation of p55 and p17. We previously identified a putative PKC phosphorylation site motif at Ser111 within the MA domain of p55 that we proposed as the site for PKC-mediated gag protein phosphorylation(20Burnette B. Yu G. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8698-8703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess this possibility, cells were transfected with the plasmid pcDL17ala111 expressing p17 with the point mutation Ser111→ Ala and treated with PMA (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation of mutated p17 was dramatically lowered in comparison with p17wt and was not stimulated after PMA treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes3 and 4) despite the expression of similar levels of wild-type and mutated proteins (Fig. 1B, lanes3 and 4). The low basal level of p17ala111 phosphorylation was only observed after radiography for 11 days rather than after exposure for 5 days as for p17wt. The marked reduction in p17ala111 phosphorylation compared with p17wt confirms our earlier prediction that Ser111 is the site of gag protein phosphorylation by PKC; however, the presence of a low basal level of p17ala111 phosphorylation that is not affected by PMA suggests that p17 may also be phosphorylated at sites other than Ser111 by other protein kinases. Because of the involvement of the MA domain in several different phases of the HIV life cycle, we speculated that gag protein phosphorylation might have a critical role in regulating the participation of p55 and/or p17 in some stage of HIV development. For example, p55 plays a central role in directing the assembly of HIV at the plasma membrane, and p17 is differentially targeted either to the inner virus lipid envelope during virus maturation (7Gelderblom H.R. Ozel M. Hausmann E.H.S. Winkel T. Pauli G. Koch M. Micron Microsc. Acta. 1988; 19: 41-60Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Gelderblom H.R. Hausmann E.H.S. Ozel M. Pauli G.

Virol. 1992; 66: 5667-5670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yu X. Yuan X. Matsuda Z. Lee T.-H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bukrinsky M.I. Haggerty S.

Haseltine W.A. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that PKC might have an effect on gag protein subcellular targeting, an event that might be manifested in the subcellular distribution of p17. Because of the recognized involvement of N-myristoylation in the membrane association of a number of different cellular and viral proteins(27Felsted R.L. Goddard C. Glover C.J. Glazer R.I. Developments in Cancer Chemotherapy. Vol. II. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 95-116Google Scholar, 28Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1991; 351: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 29Cross F.R. Garber E.A. Pellman D. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), the N-myristoylation of p17wt and p17ala111 was first investigated. Cells were transfected with pcDL17wt or pcDL17ala111 for 48 h, followed by metabolic labeling with [9,10-3H]myristate for 4 h, and p17 was immunoprecipitated with a p17-specific pAb (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-3). To establish that the incorporation of radiolabel into p17 reflected actual N-acylation and was not the result of metabolic recirculation of radiolabel into incorporated amino acids, the same experiment was carried out by transfecting cells with pcDL17ala2 containing a Gly2→ Ala point mutation, a mutation known to specifically block N-myristoylation(30Kamps M.P. Buss J.E. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4625-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of p17 was seen only in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with p17wt or p17ala111 and not with p17ala2, while similar levels of all three proteins were expressed as shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-3). These experiments establish that the expressed p17wt and p17ala111 mutants are N-myristoylated as expected. The subcellular localization of the three p17 proteins was next examined by transfecting cells with pcDL17wt, pcDL17ala2, or pcDL17ala111. After 48 h, transfected cells were homogenized in an isotonic buffer and fractionated into nuclear, membrane, and cytosolic fractions by differential centrifugation. All three p17 proteins were found exclusively in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3, Control, C lane). Since the cytosolic distribution of p17wt and p17ala111 cannot be attributed to a block in N-myristoylation or to an unexpected post-translational deacylation (Fig. 2), it most likely reflects an intrinsic property of normally N-myristoylated p17 to be localized in the cytosol. The effect of cellular activation on the subcellular distribution of p17 was then examined in cells transfected with pcDL17wt, pcDL17ala2, and pcDL17ala111. After 48 h, transfected cells were treated with PMA and subfractionated into nuclear, membrane, and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3). PMA treatment resulted in a time-dependent shift of p17wt from the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3, p17wt) into the membrane fraction within 8 min, and by 90 min, a complete reversal of membrane-associated p17 back into the cytosolic fraction was observed. A similar analysis of p17ala2 revealed that PMA treatment had no effect on its cytosolic distribution (Fig. 3, p17ala2), thus establishing that PMA-induced membrane association of p17 is dependent upon N-myristoylation. Similarly, transfection of cells with pcDL17ala111 resulted in cytosolic distribution exclusively throughout the treatment interval (Fig. 3, p17ala111). Since p17ala111 is known to be N-myristoylated (Fig. 2A, lane3), the simplest explanation for the absence of a PMA-induced membrane association is the absence of phosphorylation of Ser111. Confirmation of this conclusion was obtained by labeling cells expressing p17wt for 4 h with [32P]phosphoric acid followed by treatment with PMA for 8 min and identifying phosphorylated p17wt in the cytosolic and membrane fractions by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4). A prominent labeled 17-kDa band was observed in the membrane fraction from cells treated with PMA (Fig. 4, lane5), but not in the membrane fraction from untreated cells (lane3). In contrast, the cytosolic fractions from untreated and PMA-treated cells both contained a minor radiolabeled 17-kDa band of equal intensity (Fig. 4, lanes4 and 6), while immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with the control vector did not contain a labeled 17-kDa band (lanes1 and 2). The current model for replication of HIV envisions a central role for p55 in capsid assembly(5Wills J.W. Craven R.C. AIDS (Phila.). 1991; 5: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 10Yu X. Yuan X. Matsuda Z. Lee T.-H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dorfman T. Mammano F. Haseltine W.A. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the MA domain, which has specific roles in the targeting of gag to the plasma membrane and in the recruitment of viral envelope glycoprotein into the assembling virion. Following particle release and proteolytic processing of p55, the resulting p17 subsequently accounts for the inner MA coat of the lipid envelope of the mature infectious virus (6Yu X. Yu Q.-C. Lee T.-H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5667-5670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gelderblom H.R. Ozel M. Hausmann E.H.S. Winkel T. Pauli G. Koch M. Micron Microsc.

Invest. 1988; 58: 112-118PubMed Google Scholar). p17 is also known to play an essential role early in the infection process including the nuclear targeting of a specific viral preintegration complex that is responsible for the reverse transcription of viral genomic RNA and integration of the resulting cDNA into the host genome(6Yu X. Yu Q.-C. Lee T.-H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5667-5670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yu X. Yuan X. Matsuda Z. Lee T.-H. Essex M. J.

The involvement of MA proteins in each of these phases of the virus life cycle is driven by unique structural features encoded into p17 that express themselves successively in functionally distinct ways depending upon proteolytic processing, the timely availability of specific viral and cellular components, and regulatory signals received from the cellular host. An understanding of the specific molecular signals regulating these processes may reveal new opportunities for interfering with virus development. Activation of HIV-1-infected T-cells is known to stimulate the transcription of early spliced viral RNA transcripts encoding regulatory proteins essential for the subsequent production of the structural and enzymatic proteins required for virus assembly(1Cann A.J.

The pleiotropic response to general cellular activation could also have post-transcriptional consequences affecting the targeting and/or assembly of the newly synthesized gag proteins into the assembling virus. Such an expectation is consistent with the observation that treatment of HIV-1infected monocytic cells with interleukin-6 increases virus replication without increasing viral RNA synthesis (31Poli G. Bressler P. Kinter A. Duh E. Timmer W.C. Rabson A. Justement J.S. Stanley S. Fauci A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this post-transcriptional induction of HIV-1 proteins mediated by interleukin-6 is blocked by a specific PKC inhibitor(32Qatsha K.A. Rudolph C. Marmé D. Schächtele C. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4674-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These observations are compatible with the model proposed in this study that one of the consequences of cellular activation may be a post-translational role for PKC in regulating the function(s) of gag proteins in the virus life cycle. We have previously found that p55 and p17 are phosphorylated by PKC when cells are activated by PMA(20Burnette B. Yu G. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8698-8703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown by site-directed mutagenesis that a PKC phosphorylation site motif is located at Ser111 within the MA domain of p55. This domain is highly conserved among different strains of HIV-1(19Myers G. Berzofsky J.A. Rabson A.B. Smith T.F. Wong-Staal F. Human Retroviruses and AIDS. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1990Google Scholar), thus raising the possibility that PKC-mediated phosphorylation is of fundamental importance in gag protein assembly or post-assembly events. We have also found that the activation of cells with PMA promotes the rapid translocation of p17 from the cytosol to the membrane fraction and that this cytosol-to-membrane shift is dependent upon N-myristoylation. A direct relationship between phosphorylation of p17 at Ser111 and p17 membrane association is further indicated by our finding that when cells expressing p17 are treated with PMA, (i) p17 is quantitatively translocated to the membrane fraction coincident with the appearance of newly phosphorylated p17 in the same fraction and (ii) membrane association of phosphorylated p17 is blocked by a Ser111→ Ala point mutation. We speculate that cytokine-induced phosphorylation of gag proteins may stimulate HIV replication by promoting or accelerating the intracellular targeting and assembly of p55 into viral capsids. This effect could also extend to post-assembly virus maturation and influence the course of subsequent reinfection. The regulation of p17 membrane association by PKC is reminiscent of a similar relationship between the membrane association of the N-myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) and PKC(28Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1991; 351: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, in the case of MARCKS, phosphorylation has the opposite effect of promoting the dissociation of the membrane-bound MARCKS into the cytosol. Therefore, HIV-1 p17 appears to represent a new category of phosphorylation-dependent “myristoyl-protein switches” (33Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) in which PKC promotes the membrane association of N-myristoylated p17. Other examples of myristoyl-protein switches include the promotion of membrane association of recoverin by calcium (33Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and ADP-ribosylation factor by ADP(34Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One mechanism that might account for the specific membrane association of phosphorylated p17 is suggested by epitope mapping of p17 with a mAb that recognizes an epitope that includes both the N and C termini of p17(35Papsidero L.D. Sheu M. Ruscetti F.W. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 267-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the native conformation of p17 involves the juxtapositioning of the N-terminal myristoylated domain of p17 near to its C-terminal Ser111. If such is indeed the case, we hypothesize that phosphorylation of Ser111 might facilitate a conformational change involving the covalently bound myristate. The consequence of such a “switch” could result in the exposure of a domain that promotes membrane association. However, since the membrane fraction used in our analysis includes various cellular components in addition to lipid membranes, the specificity of this membrane targeting signal remains undefined. While the physiological significance of gag protein phosphorylation is not yet known, we suggest that cellular activation could affect the subcellular targeting of either the mature MA protein or its p55 precursor. In the case of p55, such a signal could promote the rapid assembly of viral particles at the plasma membrane from the pool of accumulating gag precursors in the cytoplasm. In the case of p17, cytokine-induced phosphorylation could provide an independent targeting signal that is important for its association with the inner lipid virus envelope of the mature virion or for regulating the involvement of p17 in preintegration complex formation or nuclear targeting. It might also facilitate the interaction of gag proteins with viral envelope glycoprotein during capsid assembly. In any event, inhibition of such a post-translational activation signal could account in part for the anti-HIV-1 activity reported for specific PKC inhibitors(32Qatsha K.A. Rudolph C. Marmé D. Schächtele C. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4674-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Based on analogy with other retroviral MA proteins, one would predict that the membrane targeting determinants of p55 would be located within the MA domain(36Jones T.A. Blaug G. Hansen M. Barklis E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2265-2279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Rhee S.S. Hunter E. Cell. 1990; 63: 77-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 38Rhee S.S. Hunter E. J.

Indeed, the dependence of p55 membrane binding on N-myristoylation and the subsequent developmental events (14Bryant M. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), the close association of the p17 fragment with the inner lipid envelope of the mature virus(7Gelderblom H.R. Ozel M. Hausmann E.H.S.

Invest. 1988; 58: 112-118PubMed Google Scholar), and the recognized role for involvement of N-myristoylation in the membrane association of a number of cellular proteins (27Felsted R.L. Goddard C. Glover C.J. Glazer R.I. Developments in Cancer Chemotherapy. Vol. II. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 95-116Google Scholar, 28Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A.

Biol. 1984; 4: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) would predict that the mature MA protein is also localized to the membrane fraction. So it was somewhat surprising to find that p17 is expressed exclusively in the cytosol. Nevertheless, this finding is consistent with the report that small nonoverlapping deletions covering most of the MA domain have no noticeable effect on p55 processing or on virus formation (10Yu X. Yuan X. Matsuda Z. Lee T.-H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that truncations, deletions, and point mutations C-terminal to the MA domain block the membrane association of the mutated gag proteins (16Biemans R. Thines D. Gheysen D. Rutgers T. Cabezon T. AIDS (Phila.). 1992; 6: 541-546PubMed Google Scholar). 2G. Yu and R. L. Felsted, manuscript in preparation. Such a membrane targeting potential for the MA domain is also incompatible with the known role for mature p17 in providing the karyotypic nuclear targeting signal of the post-infection preintegration complex(11Bukrinsky M.I. Haggerty S. Dempsey M.P. Sharova N. Adzhubdel A. Spitz L. Lewis P. Goldfarb D. Emerman M. Stevenson M. Nature. 1993; 365: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 12Dorfman T. Mammano F. Haseltine W.A. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings therefore confirm and extend earlier reports that while N-myristoylation may be necessary for p55 membrane association, other structural signals are also required(14Bryant M. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 16Biemans R. Thines D. Gheysen D. Rutgers T. Cabezon T.

https://openalex.org/W1971146473,"Previous work has suggested that a 97-kDa protein (p97) is involved in the signal transduction pathway of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as well as interleukin 3, erythropoietin, and interleukin 2. We have examined the relationship of p97 to the protein tyrosine kinase Fes in the GM-CSF signal transduction pathway in erythroid and myeloid cell lines. GM-CSF stimulation of three different cell lines induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p97 as well as a number of other phosphotyrosylproteins. Although each cell line expressed the proto-oncogene product Fes, antisera specific for Fes did not recognize p97 in immunoblotting experiments. Furthermore, immunodepletion of Fes did not reduce the amount of p97 in GM-CSF-treated cells. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated that p97 and Fes have similar charge to mass ratios, and limited proteolytic mapping of p97 and Fes suggested that these proteins may be related but are not identical. Our studies demonstrate that p97 is not Fes but is probably a Fes-related protein.

INTRODUCTIONGM-CSF 1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSFgranulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factorILinterleukinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. stimulates proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells as well as activation of neutrophils(1Metcalf D.

The receptor for GM-CSF consists of an α subunit of 85 kDa which binds ligand with low affinity and a β subunit of approximately 120 kDa which does not bind ligand but converts the receptor complex to high affinity binding(3Gearing D. King J. Gough N. Nicola N. EMBO J. 1988; 8: 3667-3676Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 4Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D. Arai K. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similar to other members of the hemapoietin receptor superfamily, the components of the GM-CSF receptor do not contain intrinsic tyrosine or serine/threonine kinase activity. Recent work has suggested that the rapid increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by GM-CSF may be mediated through activation of multiple tyrosine kinases. A number of Src-like tyrosine kinases (Hck, Lyn, and Yes), as well as JAK2, are stimulated in response to GM-CSF(5Witthuhn B. Quelle F. Silvernnoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.

Blood. 1993; 81: 3193-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has suggested that Fes is activated in response to GM-CSF as well as IL-3 and erythropoietin. Interestingly, a number of laboratories have reported a phosphotyrosylprotein similar in size to Fes (90-100 kDa) in GM-CSF-, IL-3-, or erythropoietin-stimulated cells (12Linnekin D. Evans G.

Druker B. Cannistra S. Furukawa Y. Torimoto Y. Griffin J. Blood. 1990; 76: 706-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we previously have described a putative tyrosine kinase of 97 kDa (p97) phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to GM-CSF(12Linnekin D. Evans G. Michiel D. Farrar W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23993-23998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study addresses whether p97 is the proto-oncogene product Fes or potentially a Fes-related protein.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines, Growth Factors, and AntibodiesMo7e and TF-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum (Inovar), 10-20% conditioned media from A5637 cells (producers of GM-CSF and stem cell factor), 1% L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For experiments examining the effects of Me2SO on HL-60 response to GM-CSF, cells were cultured 3 days in 1.25% Me2SO (Sigma). Recombinant GM-CSF was obtained from the Biological Response Modifiers Program (Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD) and was produced by Peprotech. The antisera used to immunoprecipitate Fes was a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, which included amino acids 381-563 of murine Fes. The antisera used to immunoblot Fes was a rat monoclonal antibody purchased from Oncogene Science. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY-20 (ICN) was used for immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosylproteins.In Vivo Radiolabeling, Immunoprecipitation, Electrophoresis, and ImmunoblottingMetabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate, immunoprecipitations, one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described in detail previously(9Linnekin D. Howard O.M.Z. Park L. Farrar W.L. Ferris D.F. Longo D.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 94-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Peptide MappingPeptide mapping was performed as described by Cleveland et al.(16Cleveland D.W. Fischer S. Kirschner M. Laemmli U. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, anti-Fes or anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from GM-CSF-stimulated myeloid cells radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate were resolved using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The band corresponding to either Fes or p97 was excised from the gel, rehydrated in water, and incubated for 30 min in Cleveland equilibration buffer containing 125 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and 0.1% SDS. The gel slice was then placed in a preformed well of a stacking gel, underlayered with equilibration buffer containing 20% glycerol, then overlaid with equilibration buffer containing 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and 0.05 μg of V8 protease (Boehringer Mannheim). Electrophoresis was performed using a 1.5-mm, 15% polyacrylamide gel as described previously(16Cleveland D.W. Fischer S. Kirschner M. Laemmli U. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSTwo factor-dependent human cell lines widely used for study of the GM-CSF signal transduction pathway are Mo7e and TF-1 cells. Stimulation of either of these cell lines results in increases in proliferative response ranging from 20-200 fold over control (data not shown). Another factor-responsive cell line used for study of human GM-CSF are HL-60 cells cultured in Me2SO for 3 days. These cells, although approaching a differentiated phenotype, have a transient capacity to proliferate in response to GM-CSF and have been used for study of GM-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation(9Linnekin D. Howard O.M.Z. Park L. Farrar W.L. Ferris D.F. Longo D.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 94-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 1A are the results of GM-CSF stimulation of the Mo7e and HL-60/Me2SO cells. Cells were radiolabeled for 3 h with [32P]orthophosphate, stimulated with GM-CSF for 10 min, and lysed, and phosphotyrosylproteins were immunoprecipitated using PY-20, a monoclonal antibody specific for phosphotyrosine. Phosphotyrosylproteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE and visualized using autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1A, GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of a 97-kDa protein as well as phosphotyrosylproteins of 140, 120, 70, 55, and 42 kDa in the Mo7e and HL-60/Me2SO cells. Identical results were also obtained with the TF-1 cell line (data not shown).Expression of Fes was next examined in the Mo7e, TF-1, and HL-60/Me2SO cell lines. Shown in Fig. 1B are results of a Fes immunoblot of Fes immunoprecipitates performed on equivalent amounts of protein isolated from the cells indicated. As expected, Fes was present in the erythroid and myeloid cells (Mo7e, HL-60/Me2SO, and TF-1) but not in the lymphoid line, Jurkat.Previous work has suggested that GM-CSF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Fes as well as increases its autophosphorylation (10Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1993; 81: 3193-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our prevous work demonstrated that p97 has a number of features consistent with those of a tyrosine kinase(12Linnekin D. Evans G. Michiel D. Farrar W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23993-23998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether p97 was the proto-oncogene product Fes, we performed immunoblotting of radiolabeled phosphotyrosylproteins from untreated or GM-CSF-treated Mo7e cells. As shown in the autoradiograph in Fig. 2A, GM-CSF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p97; however, the Fes antisera did not recognize p97 in the immunoblot shown in Fig. 2B. The identical results were obtained in each of the three cell lines tested. These experiments were done with phosphotyrosylproteins immunoprecipitated from 10-fold more cells (108 cells/point) then the studies shown in Fig. 1 to reduce the probability that the amount of p97 in the immunoprecipitate was below the threshold of detection of the antibody used to detect Fes. As another approach to address any potential relationship between p97 and Fes, we performed immunodepletion studies. Using conditions in which Fes could clearly be immunodepleted (Fig. 2C), we found no reduction in the amount of radiolabeled p97 in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from GM-CSF-stimulated cells (Fig. 2D).Figure 2:Fes-specific antibody does not immunoblot p97.

The Fes-depleted supernatants were saved and reimmunoprecipitated with more Fes antibody. Shown are the Fes immunoblots before and after immunodepletion. PanelD, immunodepletion of Fes does not reduce the levels of p97. Mo7e cells were radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described in Fig. 1. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of GM-CSF and lysed, and lysates clarified. The indicated lysate was depleted of Fes through immunoprecipitation and phosphotyrosylproteins from all the lysates were immunoprecipitated as described in Fig. 1. Phosphotyrosylproteins were visualized using autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined whether we could detect GM-CSFinduced phosphorylation of Fes in vivo (Fig. 3). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Fes was examined in both Mo7e (Fig. 3A) and Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells (Fig. 3B) after stimulation with GM-CSF. Although no GM-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Fes was observed in either cell line, the Fes immunoblots in Fig. 3(C and D) demonstrate that Fes was present in each of the immunoprecipitates. We also examined the effects of GM-CSF on phosphorylation of Fes using [32P]orthophosphate and found no changes at any time point examined (Fig. 3E). Thus, using anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting as well as radiolabeling procedures, we could not detect GM-CSFinduced phosphorylation of Fes.Figure 3:GM-CSF does not induce phosphorylation of Fes. Mo7e (panelsA and C) or Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells (panels B and D) were resuspended at 2 × 107/ml in RPMI 1640. Cells were stimulated for the indicated times, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with antibody to Fes or a control. Immunoprecipitates were resolved using SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon, and Western blots performed using either antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine (panelsA and B) or Fes (panelsC and D). PanelE, Mo7e radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate were stimulated with GM-CSF, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with antibody specific for Fes. Immunoprecipitates were resolved using SDS-PAGE and proteins visualized using autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The previous experiments suggested that p97 represented a protein distinct from the Fes tyrosine kinase. To address any potential relationship between Fes and p97, we examined the charge to mass ratio of GM-CSF-induced phosphotyrosylproteins and Fes using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Samples were subjected to isoelectric focusing in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. As shown in Fig. 4, the migration patterns of p97 and of Fes were quite similar. Both Fes and p97 migrated to a relatively basic position in the isoelectric focusing dimension; however, Fes consistently had a slightly broader and more basic position. Somewhat surprisingly, the molecular sizes of p97 and Fes, originally described as a 92-kDa protein, were close to identical when resolved in the second dimension. The basis for this apparent discrepancy relates to the debate over the actual molecular weight of the phosphorylase b marker used for the molecular mass standards. While phosphorylase b was once thought to be a 92-kDa protein, later work demonstrated it to be 97 kDa. Thus it is likely that the apparent molecular mass of Fes may actually be closer to 97 kDa. We also examined migration of Fer, another member of the Fps/Fes family of tyrosine kinases using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Interestingly, similar to p97 and Fes, Fer also migrated toward the basic end of the isoelectric focusing gel (data not shown). In contrast, however, in SDS-PAGE gels, Fer migrated at a molecular weight distinctly greater than p97 or Fes. These data suggest that p97 is not Fes or Fer but may represent a related protein. To further test this postulate, we performed limited peptide mapping of p97 and Fes isolated from GM-CSF-stimulated cells. Comparison of the peptide maps of Fes and p97 shown in Fig. 5 demonstrates that several, but not all, of the proteolytic fragments from Fes were the same molecular weight as those generated from the digestion of p97. These data, considered in conjunction with the similarity in migration of p97 and Fes using two-dimensional electrophoresis, strongly suggest that these proteins are related but distinct.Figure 4:Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of GM-CSF-induced phosphotyrosylproteins and Fes. Mo7e cells were radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described in Fig. 1. Cells were stimulated with GM-CSF for 10 min and lysed, and either Fes or phosphotyrosylproteins were isolated using immunoprecipitation.

Of these members, Fer is expressed relatively ubiquitously, FerT is testes-specific and Fes is expressed predominantly in myeloid cells and certain erythroid progenitors. Recent work has suggested that Fes may be activated in response to GM-CSF, IL-3, and erythropoietin(10Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1993; 81: 3193-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fes has also been suggested to play a role in maintaining viability of granulocytes during differentiation(23Manfredini R. Grande A. Tagliafico E. Barbieri D. Zucchini P. Citro G. Zupi G. Franceschi C. Torelli U. Ferrari S. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory identified a putative protein tyrosine kinase of approximately 97 kDa (p97), which was phosphorylated in response to a number of different hematopoietic growth factors(12Linnekin D. Evans G. Michiel D. Farrar W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23993-23998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to address the relationship between Fes and the 97-kDa protein phosphorylated in response to GM-CSF. For this purpose we have used three cell lines of erythroid and myeloid origin which express Fes and proliferate in response to GM-CSF. Consistent with previous work, p97 was one of the dominant phosphotyrosylproteins induced by GM-CSF in each of the cell lines examined (Fig. 1). Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that p97 is not Fes. First, anti-Fes did not recognize p97 in the GM-CSF-induced phosphotyrosylproteins (Fig. 2, A and B). Second, immunodepletion of Fes did not reduce the levels of the radiolabeled p97 in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2D). Third, we did not observe GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of Fes using either anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting or [32P]orthophosphate radiolabeling (Fig. 3). Fourth, peptide mapping experiments of Fes and p97 suggested that these two proteins are distinct but probably related (Fig. 5). In this regard, the similarity in the migration of p97, Fes, and Fer in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis further suggests that these proteins are related (Fig. 4). We have also examined whether p97 is the Fps/Fes family member Fer and found it unlikely based on the difference in molecular weight of p97 and Fer, as well as the absence of cytokine-induced increases in Fer autophosphorylation. 2D. K. Ferris, unpublished data. In summary, these studies demonstrate that p97 is not the Fes proto-oncogene product and suggest that it is a member of the Fps/Fes family of tyrosine kinases.Recent work has suggested a broader role for Fes in mammalian cell physiology than previously thought. Fes has been observed in embryonic tissues, and Fes or a Fes-related protein has been reported in murine lymphoid cell lines(24Care A. Mattia G. Montesoro E. Paroline I. Russo G. Colombo M. Reschle C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 739-747PubMed Google Scholar, 25Izuhara K. Feldman R. Greer P. Harada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18623-18629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further more, we have previously noted a protein of approximately 97-kDa which is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to IL-2(12Linnekin D. Evans G. Michiel D. Farrar W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23993-23998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Farrar W. Ferris D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12562-12567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ferris D. Willette-Brown J. Linnekin D. Farrar W. Lymphokine Res. 1989; 8: 215-224PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide mapping of the IL-2-induced phosphotyrosylprotein of 97-kDa and a protein of similar size and pI phosphorylated in response to GM-CSF from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled lymphoid and myeloid cells has indeed suggested that these proteins are either closely related or identical(12Linnekin D. Evans G. Michiel D. Farrar W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23993-23998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, our efforts to determine if these proteins are identical through peptide mapping of p97 from [35S]methionine-labeled phosphotyrosylproteins from GM-CSF-stimulated myeloid cells and IL-2-stimulated lymphoid cells have failed. Thus, to date, the experimental designs necessary to further address the relationship of the 97-kDa protein found in cytokine-stimulated myeloid and lymphoid cells have been unsuccessful.The role of the Fes proto-oncogene product in cytokine signal transduction has been somewhat controversial. Hanazano and colleagues (10Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1993; 81: 3193-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have seen increases in Fes autophosphorylation, as well as increases in its tyrosine phosphorylation after stimulation of TF-1 cells with GM-CSF, IL-3, or erythropoietin. In addition, these investigators have reported that GM-CSF induces Fes to associate with the β chain of the GM-CSF receptor(10Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, other groups have not found Fes activated in response to either erythropoietin or GM-CSF(5Witthuhn B. Quelle F. Silvernnoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Thus, more work will be necessary to delineate more conclusively the role of Fes in signal transduction of hematopoietic cytokines. A relatively large body of work has also suggested that Fes plays a role in the differentiated phenotype in myeloid cells. Although overexpression of Fes partially abrogated CSF-1 dependence in a macrophage-derived cell line, it appeared to be through a signal transduction pathway distinct from that utilized by CSF-1(28Areces L. Sbarba R. Jucker M. Stanley R. Feldman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Glazer and co-workers (29Yu G. Smithgall T. Glazer R. J. Biol.

Grande A. Tagliafico E. Barbieri D. Zucchini P. Citro G. Zupi G. Franceschi C. Torelli U. Ferrari S. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These investigators concluded that Fes played a role in preventing apoptosis during granulopoiesis.Considered in total, these observations strongly suggest that, as in the Src and JAK family of tyrosine kinases, Fes/Fer have members that perform parallel or similar functions in the signal transduction pathways of multiple stimuli. Our studies suggest that p97 is related to Fes and may represent a new member of the Fps/Fes/Fer family of protein tyrosine kinases. Future work will be directed toward cloning new members of this family of tyrosine kinases and better characterizing their role in receptor-effector coupling of hematopoietic cytokines.

The receptor for GM-CSF consists of an α subunit of 85 kDa which binds ligand with low affinity and a β subunit of approximately 120 kDa which does not bind ligand but converts the receptor complex to high affinity binding(3Gearing D.

Similar to other members of the hemapoietin receptor superfamily, the components of the GM-CSF receptor do not contain intrinsic tyrosine or serine/threonine kinase activity. Recent work has suggested that the rapid increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by GM-CSF may be mediated through activation of multiple tyrosine kinases. A number of Src-like tyrosine kinases (Hck, Lyn, and Yes), as well as JAK2, are stimulated in response to GM-CSF(5Witthuhn B. Quelle F. Silvernnoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.

Interestingly, a number of laboratories have reported a phosphotyrosylprotein similar in size to Fes (90-100 kDa) in GM-CSF-, IL-3-, or erythropoietin-stimulated cells (12Linnekin D. Evans G.

To study the interaction of the insulin receptor with IRS-1 in vitro, we expressed in Escherichia coli the amino acids 516-777 of human IRS-1 (hIRS-p30) covering five potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites within YXXM motifs. Kinetic data for tyrosine phosphorylation of hIRS-p30 by partially purified insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor I receptor and by baculovirus-expressed insulin receptor kinase domain were determined. Native insulin receptor demonstrated the highest affinity to hIRS-p30 (Km = 6.8 ± 0.6 μM), followed by the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (Km = 9.9 ± 1.0 μM). We used the soluble recombinant insulin receptor kinase domain, which phosphorylated hIRS-p30 with high affinity (Km = 11.9 ± 0.8 μM), and affinity columns prepared by coupling hIRS-p30 to NHS-activated Sepharose for binding assays. The insulin receptor kinase domain phosphorylated the hIRS-p30 on the column, was bound by the immobilized hIRS-p30, and was eluted with high salt buffer.

Studies (Roca and Cox, 1990; Kowalczykowski, 1991; Radding, 1991; Cox, 1994) 2W. A. Bedale and M. M. Cox, unpublished data. have provided evidence for up to four reaction phases. The first phase is the cooperative assembly of RecA on ssDNA. In the presence of ATP or ATPγS (a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog), this results in a right-handed helical filament with a pitch of 95 Å and an axial rise per nucleotide of 5.1 Å. There are 6 RecA monomers and 18 nucleotides per helical turn. The second phase is the homologous alignment of a duplex DNA with the ssDNA in the nucleoprotein filament. When the topology of the DNA substrates permits, the second phase is followed closely by the transfer of the complementary strand of the duplex DNA to the ssDNA to form a short (≈1000 bp) region of hybrid or heteroduplex DNA. 3Duplex DNA that arises from completely complementary sequences will be referred to as hybrid DNA, whereas duplex DNA products containing mismatches will be referred to as heteroduplex DNA. This third phase is facilitated by binding energy within the filament and requires bound ATP but not ATP hydrolysis (Menetski, et al., 1990; Rehrauer and Kowalczykowski, 1993). The limited strand exchange in phase 3 is bidirectional, blocked by structural barriers in the DNA, and limited to three DNA strands. In the final phase, this short segment of hybrid DNA is extended in a branch migration coupled to ATP hydrolysis (Cox, 1994). The extension is unidirectional (5′ to 3′ with respect to the single-stranded DNA) (Konforti and Davis, 1992; Jain et al., 1994), bypasses structural barriers in the DNA (Kim, et al., 1992a; Rosselli and Stasiak, 1991), and accommodates four DNA strands (Kim, et al., 1992b). single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA supercoiled closed-circular form of plasmid or bacteriophage DNA as isolated from E. coli cells linear double-stranded DNA 4′-aminomethyl-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen 4′-hydroxymethyl-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen 4,5′,8trimethylpsoralen base pairs kilobase pairs adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) the single-stranded DNA binding protein of E. coli circular single-stranded genome of bacteriophage M13 mp8. The mechanism by which RecA facilitates the alignment of homologous sequences in phase 2 is being addressed in several laboratories. RecA binds to the phosphate backbone of the ssDNA, leaving the bases exposed and accessible for base pairing in the helical groove of the RecA filament (Di Capua and Müller, 1987; Dombroski et al., 1983; Leahy and Radding, 1986). Structural studies and nucleolytic protection experiments have demonstrated that there are distinct DNA binding sites within the RecA filament that can simultaneously bind up to three DNA strands (Chow et al., 1988; Kubista et al., 1990; Pugh and Cox, 1987a, 1987b; Takahashi et al., 1989, 1991). Two types of models have been postulated for the mechanism by which RecA mediates homologous recognition between two DNA molecules. These can be loosely summarized as “pairing before strand separation” versus “strand separation before pairing” (Stasiak, 1992). A triplex DNA species could be an intermediate in either type of model (Fig. 1). Type I models arise from ideas originally set forth by Howard-Flanders and colleagues(1984) and propose that a novel DNA triplex structure exists as the initial pairing intermediate in RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange reactions (Howard-Flanders et al., 1984; Hsieh, et al., 1990). In the scheme above, this triplex would be the product of phase 2. The triplex DNA would be a “pre-strand switch” triplex, with the two strands of the substrate duplex still joined by Watson-Crick base pairs and the ssDNA in the RecA filament interacting via non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds. The strand switch could result in formation of a distinct “post-strand switch” triplex, in which the strands of the hybrid DNA would be Watson-Crick base paired and the nascent-displaced strand would interact via non Watson-Crick pairing. In type II models, homologous recognition and DNA strand exchange (phases 2 and 3 above) are concurrent (Adzuma, 1992). A local strand separation in the duplex DNA allows base pairing between the complementary strand of the duplex DNA and the incoming single-stranded DNA within the RecA filament. The binding energy within the filament effectively stabilizes the product hybrid DNA. Alternative plausible fates for the third strand lead to variations in type II models. The third strand could be immediately displaced from the RecA filament, it could remain transiently wound around the product duplex but not interact with it, or it could be transiently hydrogen-bonded to the hybrid duplex in the major groove. The latter case gives rise to the possibility that a triplex DNA could be a discrete intermediate in a type II pathway. Any type II triplex, however, would be a “post-strand switch” triplex. Regardless of when it is formed, a RecA-mediated triplex DNA structure must have parallel like strands and be sequence independent as long as the DNAs are homologous. These factors distinguish it from the well characterized stable DNA triplexes that are formed non-enzymatically (Hanvey et al., 1988; Moser and Dervan, 1987). The RecA-generated species has been called recombinant (or R-form) DNA. A triple-stranded DNA that may be analogous to R-form DNA but is formed in the absence of proteins has recently been reported (Shchyolkina et al., 1994). Indirect measurements have revealed that thousands of base pairs of homology can be aligned at early stages of the DNA strand exchange reaction (Bianchi et al., 1983; Schutte and Cox, 1987, 1988). Electron microscopy with psoralen-photocross-linked RecA synaptic complexes has provided unambiguous evidence for the alignment and close juxtaposition of three DNA strands over thousands of base pairs (Bortner and Griffith, 1990; Umlauf et al., 1990). However, these approaches do not distinguish between type I or type II models to the extent that three strands could be transiently juxtaposed within the filament in either case. Chemical modification of synaptic complexes formed in the presence of ATPγS confirmed that the base pairing within the parental dsDNA is disrupted. One strand of the duplex DNA is Watson-Crick base paired to the ssDNA within the RecA filament, and the homologous strand is displaced (Adzuma, 1992). This work favors a type II model, at least when ATPγS is present. Characterization of deproteinized DNA pairing intermediates by nucleolytic digestion, chemical modification, and thermal stability studies has provided evidence for the presence of a stable triplex DNA that has many of the characteristics of a post-strand switch triplex (Rao et al., 1991, 1993; Chiu et al. 1993; Burnett et al., 1994). No evidence that uniquely favors the existence of a pre-strand switch triplex has been reported. There is no shortage of models depicting what an R-form triplex might look like. Recent evidence involving base analog-substituted substrate duplex DNAs in RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange reactions and chemical modification of putative three-stranded DNA structures in the presence or absence of RecA filaments reveals that hydrogen bonding to the N-7 of guanine and adenine is not crucial in stabilization of any intermediate in DNA strand exchange (Adzuma, 1992; Jain et al., 1992; Rao et al., 1993; Jain, 1994). In contrast, Hoogsteen base pairing to the N-7 of purines is essential for non-enzymatic triplex DNA formation (Hanvey et al., 1988; Moser and Dervan, 1987). 4J. S. Lee, personal communication. Umlauf(1990) proposed that triple-stranded recombination intermediates utilize two additional hydrogen bonds between the Watson-Crick base pairs in the major groove of a duplex DNA and a paired third strand (Umlauf, 1990). The effects of enzymatic methylation of the N-6 of adenine and N-4 of cytosine on the stability of deproteinized triple-stranded intermediates support the involvement of Watson-Crick positions in base triplets (Rao et al., 1993). Models similar to the Umlauf proposal have recently been refined on theoretical grounds (Zhurkin et al., 1994). The present studies extend the work of Umlauf et al.(1990). They examine the effects of ATP hydrolysis on formation of three-stranded DNA that can be cross-linked with psoralen derivatives and explore the nature of the structure present after deproteinization of the complexes. They were carried out to provide direct visual support for the triple-stranded DNAs characterized in many previous studies using electron microscopy. While a three-stranded DNA species can be visualized after the DNA is cross-linked within the RecA filament, we were unable to confirm the existence of a stable triplex DNA after RecA removal. Cross-linking of three strands can only occur within the filament under narrowly defined conditions. E. coli RecA protein was purified to homogeneity and stored as previously described (Cox et al., 1981). E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) was purified as described by Lohman et al.(1986), except that an additional step utilizing DEAE-Sepharose chromatography was included to ensure removal of single-strand exonucleases. The RecA protein and SSB concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients of ∊280 = 0.59 A280 mg−1 ml (Craig and Roberts, 1981), and ∊280 = 1.5 A280 mg−1 ml (Lohman and Overman, 1985), respectively. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs. Tris buffer, Triton X-100, and ATPγS were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. DEAE-Sepharose was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Creatine phosphokinase, phosphocreatine, Proteinase K, low melting agarose, Nonidet P-40, N-laurolylsarcosine, deoxycholic acid, ATP, and 4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (TMP) were purchased from Sigma. 4′-Aminomethyl-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (AMT) and 4′-hydroxymethyl-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (HMT) were purchased from Calbiochem. The purity of the ATP and ATPγS was assayed by thin layer chromatography and were each shown to be at least 99 and 90% pure, respectively, with the major contaminant being ADP. Circular single-stranded DNA and supercoiled circular duplex DNA from bacteriophage M13 mp8 (7,229 bp) and M13 mp8.1037 (8,266 bp) were prepared using methods previously described (Davis et al., 1980; Messing, 1983; Neuendorf and Cox, 1986). The bacteriophage M13 mp8.1037 is the bacteriophage M13 mp8 with a 1037-bp sequence (EcoRV fragment) from the E. coligal T gene inserted into the SmaI site. The concentrations of ssDNA and dsDNA stock solutions were determined by absorbance at 260 nm, using 36 and 50 μg ml−1A260-1, respectively, as conversion factors. DNA concentrations are reported in terms of total nucleotides. Full-length linear duplex (FIII) DNA was derived from M13 mp8.1037 FI DNA by complete digestion with EcoRI or PstI endonuclease, using conditions suggested by the enzyme supplier. Reactions involving ATP were carried out 37°C in a standard reaction buffer containing 25 mM Tris acetate (80% cation, pH 7.5), 10 mM magnesium acetate, 3 mM potassium glutamate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and an ATP regeneration system (10 units ml−1 creatine phosphokinase, 12 mM phosphocreatine). Reaction volumes were 60 μl, and the concentrations of DNA and proteins reported below are the final concentrations after addition of all components. Single-stranded DNA (10 μM) was preincubated with RecA protein (6.6 μM) for 10 min before addition of duplex DNA (11.4 μM). After incubation of this mixture for 10 min, ATP (3 mM) and SSB (2 μM) were added to start the reactions. The ATP regeneration system maintains the ADP concentration near zero for at least 80 min. Reactions involving ATPγS were performed at 37°C in a standard reaction buffer containing 25 mM Tris acetate (80% cation, pH 7.5), 4 mM magnesium acetate, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Single-stranded DNA (10 μM) was preincubated with SSB (0.9 μM) for 10 min before addition of RecA protein (6.0 μM) and ATPγS (1 mM). After incubation of this mixture for 10 min, the reaction was initiated with duplex DNA (11.4 μM). Conditions for ATP and ATPγS reactions are different so that each proceeds optimally. The ssDNA molecules are in 2-fold molar excess with respect to the dsDNA molecules in all reactions. Visualization of reactions by electron microscopy was carried out by spreading the entire strand exchange reaction mixture after deproteinization and dialysis. Reactions were stopped after 60 min. Uncross-linked samples were incubated with Proteinase K (1 mg ml−1 final) and SDS (0.5% final) at 37°C for 30 min to remove the RecA and SSB proteins. For samples to be cross-linked before deproteinization, aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixture were incubated with AMT (30 μg ml−1 final concentration), TMP (10 μg ml−1 final concentration), or HMT (10 μg ml−1 final concentration) at 25°C for 3 min before irradiation with long-wave UV light for 4 min at 25°C as previously described (Jain et al., 1994). Deproteinization was then carried out as for the uncross-linked samples. All samples were dialyzed into 20 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA for 5 h at 25°C before spreading as previously described (Inman and Schnös, 1970). Some samples were deproteinized prior to cross-linking. Aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixtures (60-min time points) were incubated with Proteinase K (1 mg ml−1) and SDS (0.05%), Triton X-100 (0.5%), Nonidet P-40 (1%), N-laurolylsarcosine (0.1%), or deoxycholic acid (0.1%) at 37°C for 15 min. All concentrations given are final concentrations after addition of all components. In some cases, detergent was not added, and deproteinization with proteinase K (1 mg ml−1) was carried out 5 s, 1 min, or 2 min prior to addition of AMT as indicated in the specific experiment. The samples were immediately photocross-linked with AMT, dialyzed, and spread for electron microscopy as described above. The cross-linking density resulting from psoralen-long-wave UV irradiation was determined using RecA-coated gapped circles, which contained a 2,159-kbp double-stranded region. After the psoralen treatment, these molecules were deproteinized as described above and then completely denatured by heating at 70°C for 15 min in 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5% HCHO. Samples were then cooled on ice prior to spreading. When cross-linked DNA is completely denatured, each cross-over of the single strands can be assumed to represent a cross-link. Examination of such molecules by electron microscopy therefore allows an approximate determination of the cross-linking density between duplex strands. In the present case, the cross-linking densities were high enough to often produce cross-links close enough together that the denatured material appeared to contain undenatured segments (the limit of sample resolution is such that ssDNA and dsDNA cannot be differentiated if segments are less than 50 bp in length. To allow for this effect in the determination of the cross-linking density, the size of “undenatured” regions were determined by measurement and a correction applied as previously described (Schnös and Inman, 1987). Our estimate for the cross-linking density resulting from AMT treatment of dsDNA within a RecA filament is about 10 cross-links/kbp. This is reduced to 3.8 cross-links/kbp in dsDNA treated with TMP in absence of RecA. To characterize DNA pairing intermediates, we used circular ssDNA and duplex DNA with homology restricted to the 5′- or 3′-end (with respect to the + or homologous strand) as shown in Fig. 2. The 5′- and 3′-ends are also referred to as proximal and distal, respectively, with the proximal end being the initiation point in a normal DNA strand exchange reaction. A region of heterology at one end of the dsDNA prevents the homologous strand from being completely displaced and allows the intermediates to accumulate. In previous studies, stable triple-stranded DNA intermediates have been reported only when homology was restricted to the 3′- or distal end (Rao et al., 1991, 1993; Chiu, et al. 1993; Burnett et al., 1994). Synaptic complexes of circular ssDNA and partially homologous dsDNA were formed by RecA in the presence of ATP and then deproteinized. The entire reaction mixture at 60 min was spread and visualized by electron microscopy. Deproteinized samples were not cross-linked. Complexes of circular single-stranded DNA that was paired with either the 5′- or 3′-region of homology in the duplex DNA appeared similar, and representative joint molecules are shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. The double-stranded region within the circle represents the region of hybrid DNA, the single-stranded tail is the displaced homologous strand of the dsDNA, and the double-stranded tail depicts the unexchanged duplex DNA. If homology extended to the the proximal end, the joint molecules represented 90% (84 of 93) of the total molecules observed in two repeated experiments. On the distal end, the joint molecules were 28% of the total (88 of 313) examined over two experiments. There was no evidence of triple-stranded structures in any of the joint molecules examined in these experiments. There have been no triple-stranded structures observed in uncross-linked joint molecules in any of the many experiments carried out in our laboratories over the past 6 years. Next, we used a psoralen cross-linker, AMT, to covalently link the strands prior to deproteinization and spreading of the joint molecules. Psoralens undergo photochemical addition to adjacent pyrimidines in opposite DNA strands to form covalent interstrand cross-links (Kanne et al., 1982; Cimino et al., 1985). Such cross-links can be visualized and counted by electron microscopy if the duplex is completely denatured, since the single DNA strands are held together at many points (corresponding to cross-links). In the context of our experiments, several neighboring instances of a single strand cross-linked to a duplex identifies the region between the cross-links as triple-stranded DNA by inference, even though all three strands may not coincide in the spread sample. Reactions were again carried out in the presence of ATP and examined after 60 min. With homology at the proximal end of the duplex DNA, the cross-linked joint molecules appeared similar to the uncross-linked intermediates. There was no indication of any triple-stranded DNA structures in any of the 62 paired complexes observed in two independent experiments (Fig. 4A). The joint molecules represented 95% of the total molecules (duplex DNA substrates and paired complexes) examined. A similar result, the absence of triple-stranded DNA in joint molecules with hybrid DNA extending to the proximal end, was obtained after only 15 min of reaction (data not shown). 5When these same reactions (duplex DNA substrates with homology at the proximal end) were cross-linked at earlier reaction times, a substantial portion of the substrate DNA was found in complex aggregates containing many DNA molecules, precluding a careful analysis. The aggregates probably reflect the coaggregation process described by Gonda and Radding(1986). The interactions producing the aggregates were transient, as most did not survive the spreading process if not cross-linked. The aggregates were generally resolved into simple joint molecules between 10 and 30 min into the reaction. The simple joint molecules found at early time points, with hybrid DNA extending to the proximal end, did not contain triple-stranded DNA that could be cross-linked. In contrast, when homology was at the distal end of the duplex DNA, the AMT-cross-linked joint molecules consisted of three types. The first class of intermediates (25% of the paired complexes observed) were indistinguishable from the uncross-linked intermediates shown in Fig. 3B (Table 1). These intermediates were observed in 12 independent experiments; the detailed counts in Table 1 come from three of these, one chosen at random from experiments carried out with each of three different psoralen derivatives.Tabled 1 The second type of paired complexes contained regions of triple-stranded DNA extending to the end of the duplex DNA substrate (Fig. 4, panelsB-D). The structures are complicated, and it is difficult to unambiguously trace the path of the three strands in most of the triple-stranded DNAs. The three-stranded DNA contained alternating substructures in which all three-DNA strands appear to be aligned, in which one strand is displaced from a duplex DNA region and in which all strands are single stranded. The inset within Fig. 4B shows our interpretation of a region in the micrograph showing these features. The spreading conditions used to prepare the molecules shown in Fig. 4 do not cause significant denaturation of normal dsDNA. However, in the triple-stranded regions, there were repeated examples of short regions where all three strands appeared to be in a single-stranded form. This suggests that the triple-stranded structure was in a strained conformation within the filament and unraveled to the extent permitted by the cross-linking upon RecA removal. These triple-stranded intermediates represented 56% of the paired DNA molecules (Table 1). The third class of synaptic complexes were three-stranded structures identical to the second, except that they involved pairing of the circular ssDNA with an internal region of homology within the duplex DNA (Fig. 4E). They were similar to the three-stranded structures previously characterized by Umlauf et al.(1990). These intermediates represented 19% of the paired complexes observed (Table 1). The stabilization of the triple-stranded structures formed in RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange reactions is dependent on AMT cross-linking. As we decreased the psoralen concentration 20-fold (1.5 μg ml−1 final concentration), the fraction of intermediates in classes 2 and 3 decreased significantly. Photocross-linking with a 100-fold lower concentration of AMT (0.3 μg ml−1 final concentration) almost eliminated detection of the three-stranded DNA structures (data not shown). Very similar results were obtained with two other psoralen derivatives, TMP and HMT (Table 1). These have lower solubilities and weaker affinities for duplex DNA than AMT (Isaacs et al., 1977). It seemed possible that RecA-generated triplex DNA is stabilized by ATPγS. To investigate the effects of ATP hydrolysis on the formation of three-stranded DNA intermediates, we paired circular ssDNA and linear duplex DNA with RecA in the presence of ATPγS. Samples were deproteinized without cross-linking. When pairing was limited to one end of the duplex DNA or the other, the paired complexes were all DNA structures with displaced, single-stranded tails, hybrid duplex DNA within the circle, and unexchanged duplex DNA tails. There was no evidence of triple-stranded DNA in any of the 989 paired complexes observed among 2371 molecules counted (data not shown). These came from 18 independent experiments, with pairing restricted to the proximal end of the duplex DNA in 10 experiments and to the distal end in 8 experiments. For the ATPγS-mediated reactions, cross-linking with AMT prior to deproteinization had no effect on the results. All of the DNA intermediates contained displaced homologous single strands, whereas the hybrid duplex DNA regions were cross-linked. There was no indication of triple-stranded intermediates in any of the 95 and 75 paired complexes involving duplex DNA with proximal or distal homology, respectively, in two independent experiments for each reaction (data not shown). The total number of molecules counted in the experiments described above were 125 and 108, respectively. No triple-stranded DNA was observed in any reaction carried out with ATPγS, with or without DNA cross-linking. The triplex DNA species detected after deproteinization are reported to have a thermal stability similar to that of duplex DNA (Hsieh, 1990; Rao et al., 1991, 1993). Duplex DNA is not denatured by the DNA spreading procedures used for our study. The absence of identifiable triplex DNA structures when cross-linking was omitted suggested that cross-linkable triplexes might survive deproteinization but that some aspect of the procedures used to prepare samples for electron microscopy might selectively disrupt them. We therefore deproteinized reactions where the three-stranded DNAs were observed above (with pairing restricted to the distal end of the duplex DNA and with ATP) and then cross-linked with AMT before preparing the samples for electron microscopy. We disrupted the RecA filament on the paired intermediates by treatment with Proteinase K and either of two nonionic detergents, Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40, or one of two anionic detergents, N-laurolylsarcosine or deoxycholic acid, for 15 min at 37°C. Samples were then immediately cross-linked with AMT. All of the paired intermediates contained displaced single DNA strands, and no triple-stranded DNA was observed. The results with the four detergents were similar and were combined in Table 2. To verify the presence of cross-linking within the duplex DNA regions of paired complexes and to confirm that the cross-linking reactions worked under the conditions used, individual reaction mixtures were heat denatured after deproteinization and AMT cross-linking. DNAs that were incubated with Proteinase K and any of the four detergents revealed degrees of cross-linking in the duplex DNA similar to those observed without the detergents. Control experiments had shown that SDS interfered with the cross-linking reaction (data not shown).Tabled 1 We wanted to examine the transition of triple-stranded DNA recombination intermediates detected within the filaments to complexes with displaced single-stranded DNA tails. Reaction mixtures involving circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA with distal homology were treated with Proteinase K for 5 s (psoralen added immediately after addition of Proteinase K), 1 min, or 2 min and then cross-linked with AMT. Triple-stranded structures were observed in half of the paired complexes counted when the DNAs were cross-linked at 5 s (Table 2). Incubation with Proteinase K for 1 min significantly reduced the number of three-stranded complexes, and 2 min of digestion almost eliminated the triple-stranded structures (Table 2). Evidently, removal of RecA leads to an altered triple-stranded structure that is not cross-linkable, or the triple-stranded structure is lost immediately because the third strand is no longer found to be associated with the hybrid DNA. The DNA intermediates appeared to be dotted with remnants of the RecA filament as observed by electron microscopy (data not shown). We verified that the duplex DNA regions within the paired complexes were cross-linked in the presence of Proteinase K, so the results do not reflect an inhibition of the cross-linking process. As previously reported (Umlauf et al., 1990), a triple-stranded DNA species, reflecting homologous pairing between a single strand and a duplex DNA, can be cross-linked within a RecA filament and visualized by electron microscopy. The present study demonstrates that this species can be detected only in a limited set of circumstances. The three-stranded DNA is found only when complete DNA strand exchange is precluded (e.g. by heterologous sequences at the proximal end of the linear duplex DNA). The triple-stranded DNA is also observed only when ATP is hydrolyzed and cannot be detected once the RecA filament is removed. No three-stranded DNA that can be cross-linked with AMT is observed by electron microscopy during normal DNA strand exchange reactions between completely homologous DNA substrates or when pairing is restricted to the proximal end of the duplex DNA substrate. There is one major point of agreement among all of the studies in which the status of individual DNA strands within RecA-paired complexes could be assessed. Under most conditions, the RecA filament tends to stabilize the products of DNA strand exchange. When ATPγS was employed in the present study, only the hybrid duplex DNA was cross-linked within paired regions at either end of the duplex DNA. This result is in close agreement with that of Adzuma(1992). When pairing occurred on the proximal end of the duplex DNA, the hybrid DNA was cross-linked exclusively even when ATP was hydrolyzed. The homologous strand of the duplex is evidently displaced rapidly during strand exchange with ATP if the structure of the DNA substrates permits. We saw no evidence for triple-stranded structures after deproteinization using the methods described in this investigation. Only the hybrid duplex can be cross-linked with AMT in the deproteinized intermediates. The characterization of these deproteinized species with chemical and enzymatic probes also indicates that the two strands representing the hybrid duplex are joined by Watson-Crick base pairs (Rao et al., 1991; Chiu et al., 1993; Rao et al., 1993; Burnett et al., 1994). The third strand in the stable triplexes may be hydrogen-bonded in the major groove of this product duplex DNA (Rao et al., 1993) but not in a conformation suitable for cross-linking with a psoralen derivative. It is worth pointing out that there is no direct evidence in any study for a DNA triplex existing prior to the actual strand switch. In all of the putative triplex DNA structures described to date for RecA reactions, including the stable triplexes detected after deproteinization, the Watson-Crick pairing occurs between the strands destined to form the hybrid DNA product. In effect, there is no evidence for a type I model. Triplex DNA described to date appears to be a transient product of DNA strand exchange, existing only until the displaced strand can be unraveled from the product duplex and persisting only when that unraveling is precluded by DNA structure. The relationship of this species to the process by which two DNA molecules are initially aligned is unclear. The cross-linking patterns observed in the circumstances where we do observe three-stranded DNA suggest a dynamic structure (Fig. 5). The single minus strand in the complex may be positioned so that it can pair alternatively with either of the complementary plus strands. Psoralen and its derivatives most readily cross-link antiparallel strands that are joined by Watson-Crick base pairs (Cimino et al., 1985). The linking of three strands (when ATP is hydrolyzed and the third strand cannot be displaced) suggests that the paired region is divided into small subdomains in which the minus strand is alternately paired with either complement. Such a pattern was documented in Umlauf et al.(1990). The alternation could be facilitated by ATP hydrolysis. When ATP is bound (or ATPγS), the hybrid duplex is favored. ATP hydrolysis may lead to rapid displacement of the third strand (Burnett et al., 1994). If the extra strand cannot be displaced, bound ADP, or the absence of nucleotide, may permit the minus strand to switch back and pair with its original complement in the substrate duplex. This would yield a mixture of the “pre-switched” and “post-switched” states, in the terminology of Burnett et al.(1994). This kind of switching by the minus strand could be viewed as a sampling mechanism in the homology search required to align the two DNA molecules. However, DNA pairing occurs efficiently without ATP hydrolysis (at least in vitro). The switching may instead reflect conformation changes in a relatively tight complex that would normally lead to displacement of the third strand. The third strand is at least transiently displaced in distal joints because it is susceptible to exonuclease I digestion (Bedale et al., 1993). The same process may contribute to dissociation of DNA joints that are not productive (Burnett et al., 1994). A triplex species in which the bound single-stranded DNA interacts with the major groove of the incoming duplex DNA still seems like a plausible, if not probable scenario for DNA pairing. The lack of direct evidence for a “pre-switch” triplex could simply reflect a short lifetime, with the strand switch to hybrid DNA occurring rapidly once alignment is achieved. The like-strand pairing recently detected by Rao and Radding(1993) suggests that the two sites in the filament where the plus strands bind are close enough for these strands to interact. We cannot rule out the possibility that a triple-stranded DNA structure remains after RecA removal. However, our inability to visualize triplex DNA after deproteinization does establish some additional structural parameters. First, the triple-stranded structure must be less stable under some or all conditions than duplex DNA. No uncross-linked triplex DNA species survives our spreading procedures, even though the same procedures do not disrupt duplex DNA. Although the triplex DNA has been reported to be thermally stable (Hsieh et al., 1990; Rao et al., 1991, 1993), the surface tension to which DNA is subjected during spreading might preferentially destabilize uncross-linked triplex DNA. We note that the R-form DNA described by Shchyolkina et al.(1994) is much less stable than normal duplex DNA. Second, the cross-linking of the hybrid duplex DNA strands after deproteinization indicate that these strands are Watson-Crick base paired, consistent with chemical modification patterns recently reported (Chiu et al., 1993). The third strand is clearly not in a conformation that permits it to be AMT-cross-linked to either of the other two strands. Finally, the change in cross-linking patterns brought about by deproteinization also allows us to conclude that the structure of the DNA species present after deproteinization is not the same as the three-stranded DNA pairing intermediate that can be cross-linked within the RecA filament. Whatever its detailed structure, the relationship of the deproteinized species to events that occur within the RecA filament remains to be determined.
