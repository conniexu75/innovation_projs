https://openalex.org/W2124595934,"DNA damage-induced acetylation of p53 protein leads to its activation and either growth arrest or apoptosis. We show here that the protein product of the gene hSIR2(SIRT1), the human homolog of the S. cerevisiae Sir2 protein known to be involved in cell aging and in the response to DNA damage, binds and deacetylates the p53 protein with a specificity for its C-terminal Lys382 residue, modification of which has been implicated in the activation of p53 as a transcription factor. Expression of wild-type hSir2 in human cells reduces the transcriptional activity of p53. In contrast, expression of a catalytically inactive hSir2 protein potentiates p53-dependent apoptosis and radiosensitivity. We propose that hSir2 is involved in the regulation of p53 function via deacetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2012753961,"The NAD-dependent histone deacetylation of Sir2 connects cellular metabolism with gene silencing as well as aging in yeast. Here, we show that mammalian Sir2alpha physically interacts with p53 and attenuates p53-mediated functions. Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3) inhibits an NAD-dependent p53 deacetylation induced by Sir2alpha, and also enhances the p53 acetylation levels in vivo. Furthermore, Sir2alpha represses p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage and oxidative stress, whereas expression of a Sir2alpha point mutant increases the sensitivity of cells in the stress response. Thus, our findings implicate a p53 regulatory pathway mediated by mammalian Sir2alpha. These results have significant implications regarding an important role for Sir2alpha in modulating the sensitivity of cells in p53-dependent apoptotic response and the possible effect in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2022114463,"The polytopic membrane protein Rhomboid-1 promotes the cleavage of the membrane-anchored TGFalpha-like growth factor Spitz, allowing it to activate the Drosophila EGF receptor. Until now, the mechanism of this key signaling regulator has been obscure, but our analysis suggests that Rhomboid-1 is a novel intramembrane serine protease that directly cleaves Spitz. In accordance with the putative Rhomboid active site being in the membrane bilayer, Spitz is cleaved within its transmembrane domain, and thus is, to our knowledge, the first example of a growth factor activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Rhomboid-1 is conserved throughout evolution from archaea to humans, and our results show that a human Rhomboid promotes Spitz cleavage by a similar mechanism. This growth factor activation mechanism may therefore be widespread."
https://openalex.org/W2028673763,"The membrane proteins Star and Rhomboid-1 have been genetically defined as the primary regulators of EGF receptor activation in Drosophila, but their molecular mechanisms have been elusive. Both Star and Rhomboid-1 have been assumed to work at the cell surface to control ligand activation. Here, we demonstrate that they control receptor signaling by regulating intracellular trafficking and proteolysis of the ligand Spitz. Star is present throughout the secretory pathway and is required to export Spitz from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Rhomboid-1 is localized in the Golgi, where it promotes the cleavage of Spitz. This defines a novel growth factor release mechanism that is distinct from metalloprotease-dependent shedding from the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2051221246,"In Drosophila, distinct mechanisms orient asymmetric cell division along the apical-basal axis in neuroblasts and along the anterior-posterior axis in sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells. Here, we show that heterotrimeric G proteins are essential for asymmetric cell division in both cell types. The G protein subunit G(alpha)i localizes apically in neuroblasts and anteriorly in SOP cells before and during mitosis. Interfering with G protein function by G(alpha)i overexpression or depletion of heterotrimeric G protein complexes causes defects in spindle orientation and asymmetric localization of determinants. G(alpha)i is colocalized and associated with Pins, a protein that induces the release of the betagamma subunit and might act as a receptor-independent G protein activator. Thus, asymmetric activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by a receptor-independent mechanism may orient asymmetric cell divisions in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2025646149,"p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) serine/threonine kinases are important effectors of Rho family GTPases and have been implicated in the regulation of cell morphology and motility, as well as in cell transformation. To further investigate the possible involvement of PAK kinases in tumorigenesis, we analyzed the expression of several family members in tumor cell lines. Here we demonstrate that PAK4 is frequently overexpressed in human tumor cell lines of various tissue origins. We also have identified serine (Ser-474) as the likely autophosphorylation site in the kinase domain of PAK4 in vivo. Mutation of this serine to glutamic acid (S474E) results in constitutive activation of the kinase. Phosphospecific antibodies directed against serine 474 detect activated PAK4 on the Golgi membrane when PAK4 is co-expressed with activated Cdc42. Furthermore, expression of the active PAK4 (S474E) mutant has transforming potential, leading to anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells. A kinase-inactive PAK4 (K350A,K351A), on the other hand, efficiently blocks transformation by activated Ras and inhibits anchorage-independent growth of HCT116 colon cancer cells. Taken together, our data strongly implicate PAK4 in oncogenic transformation and suggest that PAK4 activity is required for Ras-driven, anchorage-independent growth. p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) serine/threonine kinases are important effectors of Rho family GTPases and have been implicated in the regulation of cell morphology and motility, as well as in cell transformation.

Wanabe N. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). To date, six human PAK1 kinases, which fall into two subfamilies, have been identified. The first subfamily consists of PAK1 (PAKα), PAK2 (PAKγ, PAKΘ, hPAK65), and PAK3 (PAKβ), which exhibit 80–90% sequence identity within their catalytic domains. Members of the recently identified second PAK subfamily, PAK4, PAK5, and PAK6, are also highly related to each other but show only about 40–50% identity to the kinase domains of PAKs 1–3. All PAK family members are characterized by the presence of a p21 binding domain (PBD), which binds activated Rho family GTPases (2Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L.

The interaction between activated Rho family GTPases with the PBD motif derepresses the intrinsic kinase activity of PAKs, leading to autophosphorylation in the activation loop and full kinase activity (8Morreale A.

PAKs 1, 2, and 3 interact via their proline-rich domains with the SH3 domain of the PAK-interactive exchange factors PIX/Cool (11Manser E. Haung H. Loo T. Chen X. Dong J. Leung T Lim L. Mol.

In addition to the PIX (PAK-interacting exchange factor) family of DH-PH exchange factors, the PAKs can also bind to adaptors such as Nck and can be recruited directly to growth factor receptors (3Bagrodia S.

Overall, both PAK subfamilies share the same organization and structure in their regulatory and catalytic domains, although PAKs 4, 5, and 6 do not have obvious PIX/Cool binding motifs. As effectors of Rho family GTPases, PAK kinases play an important role in the regulation of cell morphology and motility by regulating the actin cytoskeleton (14Sells M. Knaus U. Bagrodia S.

Daniels R. Otey C. Bokoch G. Schwartz M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). For example, PAK activity has been implicated in the localized assembly at the leading edge and disassembly at the retracting edge of focal adhesions during cell motility (14Sells M. Knaus U. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D. Bokoch G. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 21Frost J. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M. Cobb M. J.

During wound healing of fibroblast monolayers, activated PAK1 rapidly localizes to the leading edge of motile cells (15Sells M. Pfaff A. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of PAK4 has been shown to induce localized actin polymerization and the formation of filipodia (7Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The PAK4-dependent changes in the actin cytoskeleton are dependent on PAK4 kinase activity and Cdc42-dependent localization to the Golgi membrane (7Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The ability of the PAKs to modulate the actin cytoskeleton is due to kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms (14Sells M. Knaus U. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D. Bokoch G. Chernoff J. Curr.

The role of STE20 family members and Rho family GTPases in regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways is, in general, conserved from yeast to mammals (23Leberer E. Dignard D. Hareus D.

PAK1 and PAK2 can phosphorylate Raf-1 on a regulatory site that is important for Raf-1 activity (30King A. Sun H. Diaz B. Bernard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.

PAK1 has also been implicated in the phosphorylation of a specific site in MEK1 that is required for the interaction of MEK1 with Raf1, and PAK1 activity was shown to be required for anchorage-dependent growth factor activation of Raf (33Frost J.

For example, kinase inactive alleles of PAK1 block Ras transformation of Rat1 and Schwann cells (41Tang Y. et al.Mol. Cell.

Similarly, dominant negative alleles of PAK2 have been shown to interfere with Ras-mediated transformation (44Osada S. Izawa M. Koyama T. Hirai S. Ohno S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have implicated PAK1 in the anchorage-independent growth and invasiveness of human epithelial breast cancer cells (46Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Chernoff J. Kumar R. J.

Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Recent work has suggested a similar role for PAK4 in protecting cells from stress-induced apoptosis (50Gnesutta N. Qu J. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14414-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) as well as a role in cell adhesion and anchorage-independent growth of rodent fibroblasts (51Qu J. Cammarano M. Shi Q. Ha K. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of the recently identified PAKs (PAK4, 5, 6) play a role in human cancer, we analyzed the expression of PAK kinases and other STE20 family members in tumor samples and tumor cell lines. We find that PAK4 is frequently overexpressed in human tumor cell lines and that the PAK4 gene maps to an amplicon associated with human cancers. In addition, we demonstrate that an activated allele of PAK4 has transforming potential and that an inactive PAK4 mutant blocks Ras-dependent, anchorage-independent growth. Our results strongly implicate PAK4 in tumorigenesis and suggest that PAK4 may be particularly important in Ras-driven cell transformation. Northern blots were performed using standard techniques. The cells and tissues were previously described (52Bischoff J. et al.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3052-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Northern blots were prepared by running 10 μg of total RNA isolated from 60 human tumor lines, 22 human adult tissues, and two human fetal tissues, on a 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes. Filters were hybridized with random primed [32P]dCTP-labeled probes derived from a 602-bpBstXI/SacI cDNA fragment of PAK4 and a 477-bp Eco47-III/BamHI cDNA fragment of PAK6. 2527-bp PAK4 cDNA containing the complete open reading frame was isolated from a Lung λZAP library and is identical to the publicly available GenBankTM sequence (NM 005884). Mammalian expression vectors derived from pcDNA3 (with the MCS modified to contain either an N-terminal Myc or HA epitope) were used to express various alleles of PAK4. To facilitate mutagenesis and subcloning steps we introduced a BamHI restriction site immediately 5′ of the ATG initiation codon, a silent HindIII site within the open reading frame, and a XhoI site after the stop codon. Mutations were introduced by PCR and confirmed by sequencing of the complete cDNA fragment, which was then subcloned into the appropriate expression vector. The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-CGGGATCCATGTTT GGGAAGAGGAAGAAGCG-3′ (BamHI site), 5′-AGCTCGGGCAAGCTTGTGGCCGTCAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GACGGCCACAAGCTTGCCCGAGCTGCG-3′(HindIII site), and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATCTGGTGCGGTTCTGGCG-3′ (XhoI site). The K350A,K351A mutation was introduced with the oligo 5′-AGCTCGGGCAAGCTTGTGGCCGTCGCGGCCATGGACCTGCGCAAGCAGCAG-3′. The S474E mutation was introduced with the oligo 5′-CAAGGAAGTGCCGCGGAGGAAGGAGCTGGTCGGCACGCCCTACTGGATG-3′, and the oligo 5′-CGACTTCCTCCGCGGCACTTCCTTGCTCAC-3′ was used to intro- duce aSacII site to facilitate subcloning of the S474E mutant. The oligo 5′-GAAGATCTCCGCGCCGTCCAACTTCGAGTTCCGCGTGTTCACGGGCTTCGAC-3′ was used to introduce the H19L,H22L mutation. For the generation of GST fusion proteins the kinase domain of PAK4 (aa 291–591) was amplified by PCR, which introduced a 5′ BamHI and a 3′XhoI site and then cloned as aBamHI/XhoI fragment pGEX-4T-1. The 5′BamHI site was introduced using the following oligo: 5′-CGGGATCCTCACCACAGCGGGAGCCACAG-3′. Mammalian expression vectors: pRK5 Myc-tagged Cdc42 (L61) (gift from A.

For detection of the HA epitope the HA-7 mAb antibody (Sigma) was used. Phospho-specific anti-PAK4 polyclonal rabbit antibodies were raised against the KLH-conjugated phosphorylated peptide 682 synthesized with Ser-474 phosphorylated (CRRKpSLVGTPYWMAPE). The phospho-specific αPAK4 polyclonal sera was further purified on a protein A affinity column. The specificity of the protein A purified sera was determined by testing against peptides 681, 682, and 704 (see Fig. 3A). As necessary, any antibodies cross-reacting with the non-phosphorylated peptide were removed by passing the protein A purified sera through peptide 681-coupled Ultralink-Iodoacetyl column (Pierce). For Western analysis the protein A-purified phospho-specific anti-PAK4 (phospho-Ser-474) sera was used at 1/4000 dilution. For immunofluorescence experiments the protein A-purified phospho-specific anti-PAK4 antibody was pre-absorbed with peptides 681 and 704 (see “Immunofluorescence” below). Cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137.5 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm pNPP, 20 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (4 mm Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin). After vortexing, lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-Myc mAb and protein G-agarose (Roche Diagnostics). After incubating lysates for 4 h at 4 °C, immune complexes were purified by several low speed centrifugations followed by four washes with lysis buffer and by a final wash with kinase buffer (without ATP).In vitro kinase assays were done in kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmp-nitro-phenyl phosphate, 20 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, 20 μm ATP, and 0.5 μl [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml NEN-BLUNEG 502A) with various peptide substrates. Kinase reactions in a final volume of 20 μl were incubated with constant shaking at 30 °C for 30 min with a thermomixer (Eppendorf) and then stopped by addition of SDS-loading buffer and incubation at 100 °C for 10 min. Substrate phosphorylation was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Low passage mouse NIH3T3 cells that had been previously established in the laboratory of T. Hunter were obtained from M. Broome. 293T cells and low passage rat intestinal epithelial (RIE1) cells were obtained from S. Courtneidge. Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v), 1 mmglutamine, penicillin 100 units/ml, and streptomycin 100 units/ml and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfections were carried out using either LipofectAMINE according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) or calcium phosphate-mediated transfection, as appropriate. Cells were transfected at low density (5–10% confluence) and maintained in low serum until harvested 24 h after transfection for immunoprecipitation kinase assays. Low passage NIH3T3 cells especially derived for their low rate of spontaneous transformation as well as for their growth properties (growth arrest in low serum at low density) were employed in transformation assays. Typically, 14–18 days after transfection foci were visualized by crystal violet staining. The cells were washed with PBS, then fixed for 10 min with 10% acetic acid (v/v), then stained for 10 min in 0.4% (w/v) crystal violet in 10% (v/v) ethanol, and finally extensively washed with deionized water, inverted, and dried at room temperature (53Clark G. Cox A. Graham S. Der C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For RIE1 cells, foci were visualized 21–24 days after transfection. For transformation assays, media was changed every 3 days. For soft agar assays, cells were plated on top of 0.6% bottom agar in growth medium and overlaid with 0.4% top agar in growth medium. Wells were supplemented with top agar in growth medium every 3–4 days. Typically, colonies growing in soft agar after 2–3 weeks were photographed with a 10× objective using a standard inverted microscope. Activated allele of Ha-Ras (L61) in pZIPNeo was used in transformation and co-transformation assays with various alleles of PAK4 as indicated. Coverslips were placed in 24-well tissue culture trays and seeded at a density of 2 × 104cells/well. Cells were transfected the following day. The medium was replaced 6 h post transfection, and the cells were allowed to grow for 48 h. Coverslips were washed extensively with PBS and then fixed with cold 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were solubilized using a standard solution of 0.5% Triton X-100, washed, and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5 μg/ml goat IgG at 4 °C overnight. For detection of phospho-Ser-474 PAK4, protein A-purified rabbit serum directed against peptide 682 (phospho-Ser-474) was blocked with peptides 681 and 704 at a concentration of 100 μg/ml and desalted, and specificity for phospho-Ser-474 confirmed by Western analysis prior to use. HA-7 antibody (Sigma) was used to detect exogenous PAK4 and Myc ascites (9E10) was used to detect exogenous Cdc42L61. The coverslips were washed extensively with PBS and incubated in the dark for 2 h at room temperature with a rhodamine-conjugated goat α-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or with a FITC-conjugated goat α-mouse-FITC antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), together with 1 μg/ml Hoechst No. 33342 (bis-benzimide, Sigma). The coverslips were washed and mounted in Fluorosave (Calbiochem Corporation, La Jolla, CA) and allowed to dry overnight. Images were acquired using a Nikon oil emersion 40 × 1.30 objective on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with a SPOT RT camera. To identify genes overexpressed in human cancer, we initiated an expression-based screen for several STE20 family kinases we had previously cloned. Fig.1 shows the expression profile of PAK4 and PAK6 in normal human tissues and a panel of 60 human tumor cell lines (NCI60 panel) of various tissue origins. All filters were reprobed with actin to confirm equal loading of RNA samples (not shown). In normal human adult tissues PAK4 was generally expressed at low levels. In contrast, the related kinase PAK6 showed very high, although restricted expression. PAK6 could only be detected in brain, testis, prostate, and placenta. We then examined the expression of PAK4 and PAK6 in the tumor cell line panel. In most of the tumor cell lines, PAK6 was expressed at low levels or was not detectable. Overexpression of PAK6 (relative to the normal tissue control) could only be detected in a low percentage of the cell lines. For example, two of the eight colon cancer cell lines exhibited high PAK6 mRNA levels, while PAK6 expression could not be detected in normal colon tissue. In contrast to PAK6, PAK4 mRNA was detected in virtually all tumor cell lines tested. 47 of the 60 tumor cell lines (78%) exhibited significantly increased PAK4 expression, relative to the normal tissue controls. We extended our analysis by examining PAK4 protein expression in matched human normal and tumor tissue biopsies. PAK4 protein expression in normal tissues varied from undetectable (heart, stomach, brain, and liver) to moderate (ovary and colon) to high (intestine). Overexpression of a particular gene can be the result of deregulated gene expression or of gene amplification. To determine whether the overexpression of PAK4 message and protein originated from an amplification of the PAK4 gene, we sought to map the chromosomal location of PAK4 using the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid panel (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The mapping placed PAK4 9.76 cR from D19S220 with a LOD score >3.0. Using the mapping tools available at the Genome Data base (gdb.org/gdb/) D19S220 was localized to chromosome 19 within cytogenetic bands q13.2 to q13.3. This mapping was confirmed by Celera's assembly of the human genome: the Pak4 gene resides on the Celera contig GA x2KMHMR58LA, located on chromosome 19, cytogenetic band q13.2. This region of chromosome 19 is amplified in a subset of human pancreatic, colon, and ovarian tumors (Ref. 54Larramendy M. Tarkkanen M. Valle J. Kivioja A. Ervasti H. Karaharju E. Salmivalli T. Elomaai T. Knuutila S. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 685-691PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein). Because the gene maps to a tumor amplicon, we used Southern blot analysis to determine whether it was amplified in a subset of primary human tumor cell lines. PAK4 was amplified about 3-fold in Panc-1 (pancreatic carcinoma) and OVCAR-3 (ovarian adenocarcinoma), and about 2-fold in BxPC-3 (primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma) (data not shown). To better characterize PAK4 kinase activity, we analyzed a series of mutant PAK4 alleles by in vitro kinase assays. For this purpose we examined whether a peptide derived from the PAK4 activation loop could serve as a high affinity substrate for this kinase. We synthesized a set of activation loop peptides either unphosphorylated or phosphorylated on serine 474 or threonine 478 (Fig.2A). A highly related peptide derived from the Nck-interacting kinase kinase activation loop was used as a control to determine whether PAK4 showed any selectivity toward its own activation loop. The kinase domain of PAK4 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria, and in vitro kinase assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.2A shows that peptide 704 (unphosphorylated) is a substrate for PAK4 kinase, whereas the peptide derived from the activation loop of Nck-interacting kinase shows no detectable phosphorylation at concentrations as high as 20 μm. Furthermore, phosphorylation of serine 474 abolishes entirely the phosphorylation of the peptide by PAK4. Interestingly, peptide 681, which contains phosphorylated threonine 478, shows a higher affinity to the PAK4 kinase domain than the non-phosphorylated version, peptide 704 (Fig.2A). For peptide 681, we have determined aKm value of 0.5 μm (data not shown). Thus, the activation loop sequence of PAK4 is a high affinity in vitro substrate for the kinase, and Ser-474 may be the autophosphorylation site in vivo (Fig. 2). However, we do not yet know whether the PAK4 enhanced affinity for the peptides with a phospho-Thr in the TPY motif is of physiological relevance. The TPY motif is conserved in the activation loop of other STE20 group members and could be a common site for positive or negative regulation of STE20s by other kinase(s). Using this high affinity substrate, we characterized different mutants of PAK4. An activating allele of PAK4 was made by mutating serine 474 to glutamic acid. To create a kinase-inactive allele, we mutated the conserved lysine residue in the ATP binding region. In addition to the expected lysine at amino acid position 350 in domain II, PAK4 has an addi"

Their functional roles in osteoblast development have not been determined. We addressed a key component of the mechanisms by which C/EBP factors regulate transcription of a tissue-specific gene during osteoblast differentiation. Expression of both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ increases from the growth to maturation developmental stages and, like the bone-specific osteocalcin (OC) gene, is also stimulated 3–6-fold by vitamin D3, a regulator of osteoblast differentiation. We characterized a C/EBP enhancer element in the proximal promoter of the rat osteocalcin gene, which resides in close proximity to a Runx2 (Cbfa1) element, essential for tissue-specific activation. We find that C/EBP and Runx2 factors interact together in a synergistic manner to enhance OC transcription (35–40-fold) in cell culture systems. We show by mutational analysis that this synergism is mediated through the C/EBP-responsive element in the OC promoter and by a direct interaction between Runx2 and C/EBPβ. Furthermore, we have mapped a domain in Runx2 necessary for this interaction by immunoprecipitation. A Runx2 mutant lacking this interaction domain does not exhibit functional synergism. We conclude that, in addition to Runx2 DNA binding functions, Runx2 can also form a protein complex at C/EBP sites to regulate transcription. Taken together, our findings indicate that C/EBP is a principal transactivator of the OC gene and the synergism with Runx2 suggests that a combinatorial interaction of these factors is a principal mechanism for regulating tissue-specific expression during osteoblast differentiation.

Very little is known about the role of C/EBP factors in osteogenesis. Targeted disruptions of C/EBP genes have been performed, but in none of the studies were gross abnormalities of the skeleton observed (6Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Google Scholar). However, recent studies have identified C/EBP regulation of genes expressed in osteoblasts. The insulin-like growth factor 1 is a key regulator of osteoblast growth and differentiation (18Gabbitas B. Canalis E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E222-E228Google Scholar). C/EBPδ enhances either basal or prostaglandin E2-activated transcription of the insulin-like growth factor 1 promoter in osteoblasts (19Umayahara Y. Ji C. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J.

Expression of COX-2 and the α1 subunit of type I collagen is also regulated in osteoblasts by C/EBP factors (21Attard F.A. Wang L. Potter J.J. Rennie-Tankersley L. Mezey E. Arch. Biochem.

The importance of Runx2 in expression of the bone-specific osteocalcin (OC) gene is well documented (36Javed A. Gutierrez S. Montecino M. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Mol. Cell.

Thus, Runx2 performs specialized functions during bone-tissue development and differentiation in vivo. However, it is noteworthy that osteoblast-specific transcription of osteocalcin occurs even in the absence of Runx sites in the rat OC promoter (38Hoffmann H.M. Beumer T.L. Rahman S. McCabe L.R. Banerjee C. Aslam F. Tiro J.A. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 310-324Google Scholar), suggesting a tissue-specific role for other regulatory factors in osteoblasts. Activation of tissue-specific genes is controlled by combinatorial mechanisms that rely on local features of the promoters, including organization of control elements in the target genes and/or the interplay between DNA-binding proteins and various transcriptional co-regulators (39Graves B.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1000-1002Google Scholar). Both C/EBPβ and Runx factors have been shown to cooperate with chromatin remodeling factors (p300, SWI/SNF) and other enhancer-binding proteins (40Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama A. Shimizu K. Ohki M.

For example, Ets-1, c-Myb, Sp1, and C/EBP, together with Runx factors, stimulate the transcription of hematopoietic and osteogenic genes (13Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Meyers S. Rhoades K.L.

Larson C.J. Chen H.M. Hiebert S.W. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1231-1240Google Scholar), we addressed the possible role of C/EBP factors in osteoblasts and in the regulation of a bone-specific gene, osteocalcin. Here we report that C/EBPβ and -δ, but not -α, are developmentally expressed during osteoblast differentiation and are up-regulated in response to 1,25(OH)2 D3, a hormone that promotes osteoblast differentiation. We have identified a C/EBP-responsive regulatory element in the proximal promoter of the bone-specific osteocalcin gene. Deletion or mutation of this motif abrogates transcriptional enhancement by C/EBP factors. Furthermore, we provide the first demonstration that Runx2 and C/EBPβ physically interact and that C/EBP and Runx proteins act synergistically to activate the OC promoter. Importantly, this functional synergism is mediated through the C/EBP element. These findings establish for the first time a role of C/EBP in the regulation of an osteoblast-specific gene and define a novel mechanism for C/EBP in the regulation of cell type-specific gene transcription.

John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 8.5.1-8.5.9Google Scholar) with the following synthetic oligonucleotides: 5′-GGTTTGACCTAgactagtCATGACCCCCAA-3′, pUC/M13 reverse primer: 5′-TCACACAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′ (PCR 1), 5′-TTGGGGGTCATGactagtcTAGGTCAAACC-3′, pUC/M13 forward primer: 5′CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC 3′ (PCR 2), and −208 OC-CAT as template; this mutation introduced a unique site for theSpeI restriction enzyme. The PCR products were digested withBamHI-SpeI (PCR1) andApaI-SpeI (PCR2). A three-way ligation reaction was set using ApaI-BamHI-digested −208 OC-CAT as backbone. The −208 OC-CAT Runx mt plasmid was generated by digestion of the mC CAT plasmid (36Javed A. Gutierrez S. Montecino M. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7491-7500Google Scholar) with SphI-PpMU, followed by blunt ending and self-ligation. To generate the plasmid with mutations in both binding sites, two PCR reactions were set as above, but in this case −208 OC-CAT Runx mt was used as template. All plasmids were sequenced using the pUC/M13 forward primer. The expression constructs encoding the wild type Runx2 and Runx2 Δ361 are as reported previously (29Banerjee C. McCabe L.R. Choi J.-Y. Hiebert S.W. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 1-8Google Scholar,31Javed A. Barnes G.L. Jassanya B.O. Stein J.L. Gerstenfeld L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2891-2905Google Scholar). Runx2 Δ230 was prepared by PCR amplification of the coding sequences using the forward primer 5′-CGGGATCCATGCGTATTCC-3′ and a reverse primer with an engineered stop codon 5′-GGCTCGAGTCATTTAGAGTCATCAGGC-3′. Nonencoded nucleotides are underlined. The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI-XhoI and ligated to similarly digested pcDNA 3.1 His C vector (Invitrogen Inc., San Diego, CA). In-frame ligation of these constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression constructs of C/EBPα, -β, and -δ were obtained from Dr. Alan Friedman (Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD). Normal rat diploid osteoblasts obtained from 21-day fetal rat calvariae were isolated and maintained as described (49Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 420-430Google Scholar). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Rat osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2.8) cells were grown in F-12 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. HeLa and ROS 17/2.8 cells plated in six-well plates were transiently transfected with 1–2.5 μg of OC promoter-CAT and 0.1–0.75 μg of cytomegalovirus empty vector, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, or Runx expression constructs. Cells were transfected using SuperFect transfection reagent as described previously (50Javed A. Guo B. Hiebert S. Choi J.-Y. Green J. Zhao S.-C. Osborne M.A. Stifani S. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2221-2231Google Scholar). RSV-luciferase plasmid (100 ng) was included as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 24–36 h after transfection and assayed for CAT activity. The data were normalized to luciferase values obtained from the same samples. Total cellular RNA was isolated from normal rat fetal calvarial osteoblasts or adult rat tissues as described previously (51Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Cells at different stages of differentiation were washed and scraped in phosphate-buffered saline. Frozen cell pellets from each time point were thawed and processed together. RNA pellets were briefly air-dried and dissolved in 400 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and stored at −70 °C until further usage. RNA samples from different stages of differentiation were electrophoresed in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-N+membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in 20× SSC. Blots were hybridized with random primed (Prime-It kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA),32P-labeled cDNA probes for C/EBPα (NcoI fragment), C/EBPβ (EcoRI-XhoI fragment), C/EBPδ (BamHI-EcoRI fragment), human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EcoRI-HindIII fragment), human histone H4 (HindIII-XbaI fragment of FO108), alkaline phosphatase (EcoRI fragment), Runx2 (BamHI-XbaI fragment), and rat OC (EcoRI-BamHI fragment) at 42 °C overnight. The blots were washed and subjected to autoradiography. Oligonucleotides spanning the C/EBP motif from the rat osteocalcin promoter (−117/-88) were synthesized: wild type, 5′-GGTTTGACCTATTGCGCACATGACCCCCAA-3′; and mutant, 5′-GGTTTGACCTAgactagtCATGACCCCCAA-3′. The C/EBP motif is shown in bold, and the mutated sequences in lowercase. Nuclear extracts from ROS 17/2.8, HeLa, and primary rat osteoblast cells at different stages of culture (days 7, 14, and 20) were prepared by a modified Dignam method (52Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar) with 0.42 m KCl for extraction. ROS 17/2.8 and HeLa cells were plated in 100-mm plates at a density of 0.5 × 106. Cells were collected at 95% confluence by washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The whole isolation procedure was carried out on ice. Cells from five plates were pooled into a 50-ml polypropylene tube and pelleted by centrifugation at 165 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were gently resuspended in 5–10 volumes of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Aliquots (25 μl) of the nuclear extracts were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further use. Protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined by Bradford assay. A polyclonal Runx2-specific antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA) was used in supershift assays. HeLa cells were transfected with Runx2 and C/EBPβ; ∼107 cells/immunoprecipitation were lysed in 800 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1× Complete™ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 25 μm MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich)) and extracted at 4 °C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube and precleared with 20 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Xpress antibody (3 μg, Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) was added to the precleared cell lysate followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. To precipitate the immunocomplexes, 50 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose beads were added and further incubated at 4 °C with agitation for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of washing buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.3, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1× Complete™ , 25 μm MG 132), suspended in 1× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Transfected or untransfected HeLa and ROS 17/2.8 cells cultured on 100-mm dishes were lysed on the plate by adding 300 μl of SDS lysis buffer (2% SDS, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2 m urea, 1.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Proteins (30–40 μg) were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Trans-Blot membrane (Bio-Rad). Antibodies against C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and lamin B were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Epitope-tagged Runx proteins were detected by mouse monoclonal horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Xpress antibody (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Monoclonal antisera for tubulin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. We initially assessed the expression of C/EBP factors in various bone tissues and during development of the osteoblast phenotype. Fig.1A shows that C/EBPβ and -δ mRNAs are present in calvarial tissue (lane 2) and in cortical and trabecular bone (data not shown) at levels similar to those in a representative soft tissue, muscle (lane 1). C/EBPα is not detected in bone tissue, consistent with its pivotal role for adipogenesis. Osteoblast markers (OC, Runx), which are not present in soft tissues, are shown for comparison. The abundance of C/EBPβ and -δ in bone prompted examination of expression of the C/EBP family members from growth to differentiation stages of osteoblasts in vitro, representing proliferation (days 3–5), matrix maturation (days 7–12), and the mineralization stage (days 19–22), reflected by peak levels of histone H4, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and OC, respectively (Fig.1B). Both C/EBPβ and -δ mRNAs are detected from the growth to maturation stages and are expressed in a biphasic pattern. In contrast, C/EBPα expression is not detected at any stage of osteoblast differentiation, consistent with its absence in bone tissue. Two sizes of C/EBPβ mRNA are present with the larger species appearing more constitutive, whereas the smaller transcript is expressed during the growth period (days 3–5). The latter transcript is decreased markedly during the matrix maturation stage (days 7–12, when alkaline phosphatase-positive cells are forming nodules), followed by a 4–5-fold increase in expression concomitant with mineral deposition and peak levels of osteocalcin and Runx2 expression (Fig.1B). C/EBPδ mRNA is expressed in a manner similar to that for C/EBPβ, but the larger transcript is detected at very low levels. A significant (5-fold) temporal increase in C/EBPδ mRNA expression is observed during osteoblast differentiation from confluence (day 7) to the mature osteoblasts (day 22). Several Runx2 isoforms that result from utilization of alternative promoters and differential splicing are expressed (Fig. 1B). The increase in expression of the major Runx2 transcript during later stages of differentiation is consistent with increased Runx2 DNA binding activity in mature osteoblasts (29Banerjee C. McCabe L.R. Choi J.-Y. Hiebert S.W. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 1-8Google Scholar). Thus, the increases in C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ in the late stages of osteoblast differentiation appear to parallel peak expression levels for the osteoblast-related osteocalcin gene and the Runx2 transcription factor. We further assessed the relationship of C/EBP factors to osteoblast differentiation. Vitamin D3, a hormone that promotes osteoblast differentiation, is a known enhancer of many osteoblast-related genes (53Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 443-509Google Scholar). Expression of C/EBPβ is stimulated by vitamin D3 at each stage of osteoblast maturation, 6-fold during growth (day 7) and nodule development (day 12) and 3-fold during mineralization (day 19). Vitamin D3-dependent enhancement of C/EBPδ is similar to that of C/EBPβ except the -fold stimulation is lower (3-fold at all stages). Treatment of cells with vitamin D3 has no effect on the expression of C/EBPα at any stage of differentiation (data not shown). The differentiation-promoting properties of vitamin D3 are reflected by the decrease in histone H4 and the increase in OC expression (Fig. 1C). Thus, expression of both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ is strongly enhanced upon treatment with vitamin D3 in relation to osteoblast differentiation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that C/EBP transcription factors are expressed at significant levels in bone tissue, they increase during osteoblast differentiation in vitro, and their expression is up-regulated by 1,25(OH)2 D3. The enhanced expression of C/EBPβ and -δ during mineralization relative to the onset of OC transcription and in response to vitamin D3suggests that these C/EBP transcription factors may contribute to osteoblast-specific expression of the OC gene. Previous studies using promoter deletion constructs of the rat OC gene have shown that the initial 200 bp of the promoter can confer tissue-specific expression (38Hoffmann H.M. Beumer T.L. Rahman S. McCabe L.R. Banerjee C. Aslam F. Tiro J.A. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 310-324Google Scholar). This region contains a Runx-responsive motif and a homeodomain box that also binds an osteoblast-specific complex (54Hoffmann H. Green J. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 156-168Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of this region reveals the presence of a C/EBP motif (Fig.2A). To determine whether the C/EBP protein(s) can interact with this element, gel mobility shift analyses were performed using oligonucleotides (see “Materials and Methods”) containing either wild type or mutated C/EBP binding sequences (Fig. 2A). Using nuclear extracts from day 20 primary rat osteoblasts in which OC is actively expressed, we observed two major protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 2B). Specificity of these protein-DNA interactions was confirmed by oligonucleotide competition assays. Addition of unlabeled wild type oligonucleotide, but not mutant oligonucleotide, inhibited the binding of the protein complexes to the labeled probe (Fig. 2C). Taken together these results indicate that C/EBP proteins interact in a sequence-specific manner with their cognate element in the proximal promoter of the bone-specific rat OC gene. The presence of C/EBP in the protein complex binding to the OC promoter element suggests transcriptional regulation of the OC gene by C/EBP factors. This possibility was experimentally addressed by assessing the effect of forced expression of C/EBPβ and -δ on activity of full-length (−1.1 kb) and proximal (−208 bp) OC promoter-CAT reporter gene constructs in the osteoblastic ROS 17/2.8 cell line (Fig.3). The results indicate that C/EBPβ and -δ significantly enhance OC promoter activity, 4–5-fold o"

Here, we make use of the murine macrophage cells RAW264 as well as of immortalized macrophages derived from mice deficient for the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) to explore the molecular mechanisms regulating COX-2 induction in activated macrophages. We demonstrate that lipopolysaccharide-mediated COX-2 mRNA induction is biphasic. The initial phase is independent of de novo protein synthesis, correlates with cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) activation, is inhibited by treatments that abolish CREB phosphorylation and reduce NF-κB-mediated gene activation, and requires the presence of the transcription factor C/EBPβ. On the other hand, C/EBPδ appears to be essential in addition to C/EBPβ to effect the second phase of COX-2 gene transcription, which is important for maintaining the induced state and requires de novo protein synthesis. Indeed, both phases of COX-2 induction were defective in C/EBPβ−/− macrophages. Moreover, the synthesis of C/EBPδ was increased dramatically by treatment with lipopolysaccharide and, like COX-2 induction, repressed by combined inhibition of the MAPK and of the SAPK2/p38 cascades. Taken together, these data identify CREB, NF-κB, and both C/EBPβ and -δ as key factors in coordinately orchestrating transcription from the COX-2 promoter in activated macrophages.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Although the contrasting biological properties of the different prostanoids make it difficult to define their roles in physiological processes unambiguously, PG secretion by activated macrophages clearly represents an important step in the inflammatory process (2Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Indeed, COX-2, as well as COX-1, the isoform responsible for the basal steady state production of PG, represents the main target for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and compounds that can specifically inhibit the inducible but not the basal production of PG (i.e. COX-2 but not COX-1 activity) are being tested for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis (3Everts B.

Many studies have therefore recently focused on the mechanisms regulating inducible COX-2 expression in monocytic cells. Three main cis-acting elements have been identified on the murine COX-2 promoter that play a role in LPS-mediated induction of COX-2 transcription in macrophages. NF-κB is a transcription factor involved in LPS-mediated induction of many cytokines and inflammatory products, and inhibition of NF-κB activity has been reported to impair COX-2 mRNA induction (6D'Acquisto F.

Cohen P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of CREB following cell treatment with forskolin did not trigger detectable COX-2 protein induction, suggesting that CREB activation, even if required, is not sufficient to activate COX-2 expression (28Caivano M. Cohen P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Serendipitously, we have recently observed that COX-2 expression in response to LPS was profoundly impaired in macrophages derived from mice where the transcription factor C/EBPβ was inactivated (29Gorgoni B. Caivano M. Arizmendi C. Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40769-40777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). COX-2 induction could be rescued by transient or stable re-expression of C/EBPβ, suggesting that this factor is required for efficient COX-2 gene transcription in macrophages. Here we explore the kinetics of COX-2 mRNA induction and how it correlates with the induced activities of CREB and C/EBP factors, making use of both the murine macrophage cell line RAW264 and immortalized C/EBPβ−/− or +/+ macrophages. We demonstrate the existence of two waves of COX-2 induction. The first does not involvede novo protein synthesis, correlates with CREB and NF-κB activation, and requires preexisting C/EBPβ, while the second involves newly synthesized C/EBPδ and requires the DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ·C/EBPδ heterodimers.

Murine RAW264 macrophages were obtained from the European Cell Culture Collection (Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK). Interferon-γ was kindly provided by Dr. G. Garotta, (Ares-Serono, Geneve, Switzerland). LPS was a generous gift from Dr. John Lee (SmithKline Beecham). RAW264 macrophages were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 2 h before stimulation, the medium was removed and replaced with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 20 μm forskolin plus 10 μm IBMX for the times indicated in the figure legends. Where indicated, SB 203580 (10 μm) and/or U0126 (10 μm) were added 1 h before stimulation. The generation of C/EBPβ −/− and +/+ immortalized macrophages is described elsewhere. 2B. Gorgoni, P. Marthyn, M. Righi, and V. Poli, submitted for publication. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells at ∼70% confluence were stimulated with 100 units/ml of interferon-γ for 16 h and with 100 ng/ml LPS for the indicated times. After stimulation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were solubilized in 0.2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27m sucrose, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and “complete” protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet/50 ml). The samples were then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent. After stimulation, the cells were resuspended, washed three times in Buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and “complete” protease inhibitor mixture), lysed in Buffer A plus 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 for 5 min on ice, and then spun at 13,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in Buffer B (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and “complete” protease inhibitor mixture) rotated end over end for 15 min at 4 °C, and then sonicated in a 10 °C water bath (four 15-s pulses over 4 min). The samples were centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were removed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent. Proteins were denatured in SDS, electrophoresed on a 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Ponceau S staining was performed in order to ensure equivalent gel loading. Membranes were then incubated with the antibodies described below, which were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL). For immunoblotting of C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ, 50 μg of nuclear cell extracts were electrophoresed and immunoblotted using a monoclonal C/EBPβ antibody or a polyclonal C/EBPδ antibody, respectively. For immunoblotting of IκBα, 30 μg of total proteins were electrophoresed and immunoblotted using a polyclonal anti-IκBα antibody. For immunoblotting CREB, cell lysates (30 μg of protein) were electrophoresed and immunoblotted using, respectively, an anti-CREB antibody or an anti-phosphospecific CREB antibody recognizing CREB phosphorylated at Ser133 and ATF-1 phosphorylated at Ser63. EMSA probes were made by annealing single-stranded oligonucleotides with 5′-GATC overhangs. 1 pmol of probe was radiolabeled by filling in with [α-32P]dATP using the Klenow enzyme. The labeled probes were purified on a Sephadex G-50 spin column. Sequences are as follows: C/EBP, 5′-GATCCTGCCGCTGCGGTTCTTGCGCAACTCACT-3′; HpxA C/EBP site, 5′-TATTTGCAGTGATGTAATCAGC-3′; NF-κB, 5′-GATCGAGAGGTGAGGGGATTCCCTTAGTTAGGA-3′; CRE/E-box, 5′-GATCGTCACCACTACGTCACGTGGAGTCCGCTT-3′. EMSAs were performed with 4 μg of nuclear extract in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, containing 3 μg of poly(dI-dC). The complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% (for C/EBP) or 5% (for NF-κB and CRE/E-box) polyacrylamide-0.25× Tris borate-EDTA gel. For supershift experiments, 2 μl of polyclonal purified antibody was incubated with nuclear extracts and poly(dI-dC) for 30 min on ice prior to the probe addition. Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors were preincubated at a 50-fold molar excess 10 min prior to the probe addition. Total RNA was prepared from LPS-stimulated or control RAW264 cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was measured, and 50 ng was reverse transcribed using Promega avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (5 units/ml) with the oligonucleotides GTTGGATACAGGCCAGACTTTGTTG and GAGGGTAGGCTGGCCTATAGGCT (for amplification of the “housekeeping gene,” hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)), together with those for the COX-2 gene (CAGCAAATCCTTGCTGTTCC and TGGGCAAAGAATGCAAACATC) or for the C/EBPδ gene (CGGCACAGTCCGAGAAAAGG and TTGAAGAACTGCCGGAGGCC). Conditions for PCR amplification of the resulting first-strand DNA template were 94 °C denaturing for 30 s, 60 °C annealing for 1 min, 68 °C extension for 1 min, 30 cycles using thermostable Tfl DNA polymerase (5 units/ml), and 1 mmMgSO4. The PCR products showed a band of 515 bp for COX-2, a band of 233 bp for C/EBPδ, and a band of 352 bp for HPRT. Results obtained after densitometric quantifications were analyzed using the two-tailed t test. Ap value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Phosphorylation of CREB obtained by treatment of RAW264 macrophages with forskolin and IBMX did not trigger detectable accumulation of COX-2 protein after 4 h, suggesting that a distinct factor(s) induced by LPS but not by forskolin is required for COX-2 induction (28Caivano M. Cohen P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Since, however, forskolin induces a faster and more transient phosphorylation of CREB compared with LPS stimulation, we decided to also analyze COX-2 mRNA induction at shorter time points. Indeed, forskolin was able to trigger an increase of the COX-2 mRNA (1.8-fold) already after 30 min of treatment (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2), corresponding to maximal CREB phosphorylation (28Caivano M. Cohen P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This induction peaked (3.3-fold) 1 h after the treatment (Fig. 1A, lane 3) and rapidly decreased, having almost returned to unstimulated levels (1.14-fold) by 2 h (Fig. 1A,lanes 4–6). A number of studies have indicated that LPS-mediated COX-2 mRNA induction in macrophages does not require de novo protein synthesis (30Bazan H.E. Tao Y. DeCoster M.A. Bazan N.G. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 2492-2501PubMed Google Scholar, 31Morisset S. Patry C. Lora M. de Brum-Fernandes A.J. J. Rheumatol. 1998; 25: 1146-1153PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nedelec E. Abid A. Cipolletta C.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), compatible with the quick activation kinetics observed. In agreement with these reports, the increase of COX-2 mRNA induced by 1.5 h of LPS treatment was not affected by pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and4, 8.6 ± 0.33- versus 7.6 ± 0.61-fold induction), which, as already reported (33Newton R. Stevens D.A. Hart L.A. Lindsay M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Ferreri N.R. An S.J. McGiff J.C. Am. J.

Blood. 1995; 85: 3736-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) caused by itself a slight (2.38 ± 0.34-fold) induction (Fig.1B, lanes 3 and 7). Interestingly, however, CHX pretreatment did abolish COX-2 mRNA induction following a longer treatment with LPS (Fig. 1B, compare lane 6 (21.7 ± 0.64-fold induction) with lane 8 (7.95 ± 0.93-fold induction) and lane 7 (9.77 ± 1.67-fold induction after treatment with CHX alone), suggesting that de novoprotein synthesis is involved in the later phases of COX-2 transcription. Taken together, these results suggest a biphasic activation of the COX-2 gene. The first phase, corresponding to the initial activation, correlates with the kinetics of CREB phosphorylation and does not involve de novo protein synthesis, while the second phase, involved in the maintenance of the induced state, requires the action of some newly synthesized factor(s). Members of the C/EBP family, and particularly C/EBPβ and -δ, may well be involved in the second phase of COX-2 transcriptional induction, since their synthesis is increased by LPS in a number of cell types (36Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). We have therefore analyzed their induction following LPS treatment in the presence or absence of the protein kinase inhibitors that abolish COX-2 expression. C/EBPβ is already present in untreated macrophages, but it is increased by 2–3-fold following LPS treatment, peaking at 4 h (not shown). We have shown previously that treatment with PD 98059 and/or SB 203580 did not affect the induction of C/EBPβ triggered by LPS (28Caivano M. Cohen P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Indeed, U0126 and SB 203580, alone or in combination, were unable to modify the 3-fold LPS-induced increase of all three C/EBPβ isoforms, the full-length protein (FL), the liver-activating protein (LAP), and the liver-inhibitory protein (LIP) (Fig.2A, upper panel, compare lane 1 withlanes 2–5). The levels of C/EBPδ were in contrast almost undetectable in untreated RAW264 cells, but they were increased dramatically following LPS treatment (Fig. 2A, lower panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). Strikingly, the LPS-mediated induction of C/EBPδ was almost totally abolished by combined treatment with U0126 plus SB 203580 (Fig. 2A,lower panel, compare lanes 2 and 5) and only slightly decreased by treatment with either compound alone (lanes 3 and4). This is in marked contrast to what was observed with C/EBPβ, and suggests that C/EBPδ may represent the factor, or one of the factors, whose synthesis is required to maintain COX-2 transcriptional induction. Next, we analyzed by EMSA the DNA-protein interactions occurring at the level of the −138/−130 C/EBP site from the murine COX-2 promoter. Four differentially migrating complexes could be detected using nuclear extracts from untreated RAW264 cells (Fig.2B, lanes 1, 2, and11). Complexes 1 and 2 were induced by 5-fold upon LPS treatment (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1and 2 with lanes 3 and 4, and compare lane 11 with lane 13). This increase was reduced by 50% by treatment with either SB 203580 or U0126 alone (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6 or lanes 7 and8, respectively) and completely abolished by a combination of the two compounds (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 9 and10, and compare lane 13 withlane 14). The inhibition of DNA binding appeared to be specific to the newly induced activities, since the inhibitors did not affect the formation of complexes using extracts from untreated cells (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 11 and12). All DNA-protein complexes detected at the level of the COX-2 C/EBP site could be abolished by an excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide carrying either the same sequence (self) or the sequence of a known C/EBP binding site from the hemopexin promoter (HpxA) (Fig. 2C, lanes 6and 7, 13 and 14, and 20and 21), but not by an unrelated oligonucleotide (not shown). To assess if C/EBP proteins were involved in the formation of the different complexes detected and particularly of induced complexes 1 and 2, we performed supershift experiments using polyclonal antibodies against C/EBPα, -β, -δ, or -ε and nuclear extracts from RAW264 cells either untreated or treated with LPS (Fig.2C). In extracts from untreated cells, all complexes could be supershifted by anti-C/EBPβ antibodies (Fig. 2C,lane 3) and did not contain any of the other tested C/EBP family members, as confirmed by densitometric analysis of the retarded bands (Fig. 2C, lanes 2,4, and 5), although the same antibodies could readily supershift complexes obtained with different extracts and probes (data not shown). Upon LPS treatment, still no binding of either C/EBPα or C/EBPε could be detected (Fig. 2C,lanes 9 and 12), while C/EBPβ was involved in the formation of all four complexes, since all, including those induced by LPS, were abolished by specific antibodies raised against this protein (Fig. 2C, lane 10). C/EBPδ, which was absent from the complexes formed using extracts from untreated cells, was in contrast detected as part of the LPS-induced complexes 1 and 2, 40% of which could be supershifted by anti-C/EBPδ antibodies (Fig. 2C,lane 11). Of note, the amount of complexes supershifted could not be increased using more anti-C/EBPδ antibodies (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that complexes 1 and 2 only contain C/EBPβ homodimers in untreated RAW264 macrophages, while they are formed partly of C/EBPβ homodimers and partly of C/EBPβ·C/EBPδ heterodimers in LPS-treated cells. We next asked whether binding of C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, or both was affected by U0126 and SB 203580. As expected, all residual DNA-protein complexes obtained upon LPS treatment in the presence of U0126 and SB 203580 could still be supershifted by anti-C/EBPβ antibodies (Fig.2C, lane 17). Interestingly, as confirmed by densitometric analysis, no supershift with anti-C/EBPδ antibodies could be detected anymore after treatment with the inhibitors (Fig. 2C, lane 18), suggesting that the DNA binding activity involving C/EBPβ·C/EBPδ heterodimers may represent the main target for U0126 and SB 203580 action. To verify if the inhibition of DNA binding by treatment with U0126 and SB 203580 is specifically limited to the C/EBP proteins among the factors playing a role in COX-2 gene transcription, we have examined the pattern of DNA-protein complexes forming at the level of the two other main cis-acting elements involved in the LPS-inducible activation of the COX-2 promoter. EMSA experiments were therefore performed using the CRE/E-box element located at positions −59/−48 and the −402/−392 NF-κB binding site as probes and nuclear extracts from RAW264 cells either untreated or treated with LPS in the presence or absence of a combination of U0126 and SB 203580 (Fig.3). As expected from knowledge that the proteins involved can bind constitutively to DNA, binding to the CRE/E-box element was already detected in extracts from untreated cells (Fig. 3A,lane 1) and increased by 1.9- or 1.3-fold, respectively, upon 1.5 or 4 h of LPS treatment (Fig.3A, compare lanes 1, 3, and5). Treatment with the inhibitors enhanced by 2-fold the binding prior to LPS treatment (compare lanes 1and 2), but this phenomenon was not investigated further. In contrast, binding to the NF-κB element, which was not detected in extracts from untreated cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2) was strongly increased by treatment with LPS for 1.5 h (Fig. 3B, lane 3) and decreased by 50% after 4 h (Fig. 3B,lane 5). Importantly, binding to neither element was inhibited by U0126 and SB 203580 treatment. Intriguingly, LPS-induced nuclear NF-κB DNA binding activity was both increased and prolonged by treatment with the inhibitors as shown in Fig. 3B by comparing lane 3 withlane 4 (4- versus 8-fold induction) and lane 5 with lane 6 (2-versus 3.5-fold induction).

https://openalex.org/W1970383445,"The orphan nuclear hormone receptor liver receptor homologous protein-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2, also known as FTF), an unusual receptor that binds DNA as a monomer, is an essential regulator of expression of a rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid formation, cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase. In a classic negative feedback loop that is a crucial component of the complex regulation of cholesterol metabolism, cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase expression is decreased when bile acid levels are high. This repression is thought to be based on the bile acid-dependent induction of expression of the orphan receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) NR0B2, which inhibits the activity of LRH-1. We have explored the molecular basis for this important regulatory effect by characterizing the mechanisms by which mouse and human SHP inhibit LRH-1-mediated transactivation. Both SHP proteins specifically interact with the AF-2 transactivation domain of LRH-1 both in vivo and in vitro. This domain is a common target for coactivator interaction, and the SHP proteins can compete with p160 coactivators for binding to LRH-1. In addition to the N-terminal receptor interaction domain, SHP includes a C-terminal domain with autonomous repression function. Neither a deletion nor a point mutation specifically affecting this domain blocked the ability to interact with LRH-1 to compete for coactivator binding or to repress LRH-1 transactivation. However, the relative ability of these mutants to inhibit LRH-1-mediated transactivation was markedly decreased. We conclude that the proposed central role of SHP in cholesterol metabolism is based on a two-step mechanism that is dependent on both coactivator competition and direct transcriptional repression.

Although SHP does not bind DNA directly, a number of reports demonstrate that SHP can interact with a variety of nuclear hormone receptors including the thyroid hormone receptor, the retinoic acid receptor, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, the estrogen receptor-α, the retinoid-X-receptor (RXR), and the orphan receptor HNF-4 (1Seol W.

Initial results with retinoic acid receptor-RXR heterodimers indicated that SHP can inhibit DNA binding in some cases (1Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). However, the identification of an autonomous repression function of SHP suggested the existence of additional repression mechanisms for SHP (3Seol W. Chung M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7126-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This function could be particularly important for target receptors that bind DNA as monomers, because such receptors would not be sensitive to inhibitory processes based on disrupting dimeric complexes. More recent results have demonstrated that SHP can also inhibit transactivation by several receptors that bind DNA as homodimers, including estrogen receptor, RXR, and HNF-4 (4Seol W. Hanstein B.

This repression does not appear to involve effects on DNA binding and is thought to be dependent on a two-step mechanism in which SHP decreases transactivation, first by competing with p160 coactivators for binding to the nuclear receptors and second by the actions of the as yet poorly characterized autonomous SHP repression activity (3Seol W.

Earlier, we reported that either SF-1 or LRH-1 could transactivate the SHP promoter, which contains several such motifs (15Lee Y.K. Parker K.L. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20869-20873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The existence of a negative feedback regulation of SHP expression, at least in liver, was suggested by the observation that LRH-1 transactivation was particularly sensitive to inhibition by SHP. However, this effect may be limited to liver, because SF-1 was relatively resistant to the effects of SHP. More recent data also suggest that LRH-1 is essential for expression of the cytochrome p450 7A(CYP7A1) gene, which encodes cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of hepatic cholesterol to bile acids (7Goodwin B.

Increased levels of bile acids are thought to result in decreased CYP7A gene expression through a novel indirect feedback loop in which increased levels of bile acids stimulate SHP gene expression via activation of the bile acid receptor FXR (Farnesoid X receptor) (7Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol.

In this mechanism, the functional interaction of SHP and LRH-1 is the linchpin of a central axis in cholesterol regulation. The molecular basis for SHP inhibition of LRH-1 transactivation has not been defined. Although the mechanisms for the effects of SHP on other targets have been explored, unique aspects of the functional interaction of SHP with LRH-1 and SF-1 raise the possibility of distinct mechanisms for these proteins. Thus, the function of these two receptors as monomers suggests that their interactions with both DNA and coactivators may differ significantly from those of other receptors. This possibility is strongly supported by some unusual transactivation functions of SF-1 (16Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-VanHouten D.L. Flanagan J.N. Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 17Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol.

It remains uncertain whether LRH-1 transactivation is associated with such unusual mechanisms. Prompted by both the importance of the functional interaction between SHP and LRH-1 and this uncertainty, we have characterized the mechanisms by which SHP inhibits LRH-1 transactivation. SHP did not inhibit LRH-1 DNA binding. As observed with the homodimeric receptors HNF-4, RXR, and estrogen receptor, SHP did compete with p160 coactivators for binding to LRH-1. SHP mutants, retaining the receptor interaction function but lacking the autonomous repression function due to either a deletion (mSHPW160X) (3Seol W. Chung M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7126-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or a point mutation (hSHPR213C) (18Nishigori H. Tomura H. Tonooka N. Kanamori M. Yamada S. Sho K. Inoue I. Kikuchi N. Onigata K.

A. 2001; 98: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), were able to inhibit LRH-1 transactivation. However, the limited extent of this repression suggests that active repression by SHP is essential for efficient LRH-1 inhibition as described for RXR and estrogen receptor. We conclude that the previously described two-step process involving both coactivator competition and direct repression is conserved in the SHP inhibition of transactivation by the monomeric orphan receptor LRH-1. HepG2 cells were maintained in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. One day before transfection, confluent cells were trypsinized and plated into 24 well plates with a 1:4 ratio to allow the cells to reach 50–60% confluency at the time of transfection. Cells were refed with fresh medium 1 h before transfection. All transfections were carried out using the calcium phosphate method with 0.2 μg/well of both the luciferase reporter and TKGH internal control plasmids and the indicated amounts of expression plasmids as described previously (6Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Luciferase expression was assayed and normalized using growth hormone expression 30–36 h after transfection. All luciferase values were the mean of triplicates. All plasmids used here were described previously (6Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell.

LRH-1ΔC was created by PCR with primers designed to remove the C-terminal AF-2 core motif of six amino acids, LLIEML. Both the VP16 and GST versions of LRH-1 and LRH-1ΔC contain the putative ligand-binding domain of LRH-1 (amino acids 145–495). A pBluescript plasmid containing full-length human SHP was purchased from IncyteGenomics (GenBankTM accession number t69324). A PCR-amplified insert was introduced to pCDM8, pCMXGal4, and pCMXVP16 plasmids. The hSHPR213C mutant was created using PCR. All PCR constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The glutathioneS-transferase pulldown assay was used to examine protein-protein interaction in vitro. GST alone or GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, and equivalent amounts were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Incubations with [35S]methionine-labeled target proteins were run for 4 h. Unbound and nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing four times with a HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. Specifically bound proteins were eluted by treatment with 15 mm glutathione, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. The amount of specifically bound proteins was determined using a PhosphorImager. To initially characterize the repression of LRH-1 transcriptional activity by SHP, we used a transient transfection approach with a previously described reporter plasmid in which five SF-1-binding elements control luciferase gene expression (19Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim E. Moisan M.P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected from their conserved DNA-binding specificity (11Galarneau L. Pare J.F. Allard D. Hamel D. Levesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Belanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this SF-1 luciferase reporter was strongly transactivated by LRH-1 (Fig.1A), and the coexpression of mouse SHP efficiently inhibited LRH-1-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, bars 3–5). Similar results were observed with the LRH-1-responsive SHP promoter (data not shown). This inhibition is not dependent on decreased DNA binding by LRH-1, because the addition of SHP did not affect the specific recognition of an SF-1/LRH-1 response element by LRH-1 in vitro as measured by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown). Moreover, SHP efficiently repressed transactivation by the chimeric Gal-LRH-1, in which the Gal4 DNA-binding domain replaces that of LRH-1 (Fig. 1B). This latter repression was particularly strong. Only 5 ng of SHP expression vector completely inhibited transactivation by 20 ng of the Gal-LRH-1 vector, and 20 ng of the SHP vector decreased normalized luciferase expression to approximately <20% of the basal level observed with the reporter alone or Gal4 alone (Fig. 1B, compare bars 1 and 2 with bar 8). This net repression is consistent with previous results with RXR (6Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and suggests an important function for the autonomous repression function of SHP in LRH-1 inhibition. To test this prediction, a previously characterized SHP mutant lacking the C-terminal autonomous repression domain (deletion of C-terminal amino acids 160–260), mSHPW160X, was used. This mutant also repressed transactivation by either the intact LRH-1 or Gal-LRH-1 but with significantly reduced efficiency (Fig. 1, A andB). Notably, SHPW160X failed to decrease Gal-LRH-1 transactivation below basal levels, even at higher concentrations (Fig.1B, bar 11) (data not shown). We also tested human SHP for repression on this context. As depicted in Fig. 1C, human SHP also robustly repressed the LRH-1-mediated transactivation (Fig. 1C, bars 3and 4). However, this was significantly decreased by a human SHP mutation hSHPR213C previously associated with mild obesity in Japanese subjects (Fig. 1C, bars 5 and6) (18Nishigori H. Tomura H. Tonooka N. Kanamori M. Yamada S. Sho K. Inoue I. Kikuchi N. Onigata K. Kojima I. Kohama T. Yamagata K. Yang Q. Matsuzawa Y. Miki T. Seino S. Kim M.Y. Choi H.S. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the decreased inhibitory effect of this mutation on HNF-4 transactivation, and with the results described below, this finding suggests that this mutation specifically affects the SHP autonomous repression domain. Previously, we have shown that SHP specifically requires the AF-2 surface of homodimer-binding nuclear receptors for both interaction and repression (6Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To test whether SHP also targets AF-2 surface of the monomeric LRH-1, a deletion of the conserved six amino acid motif of the putative helix 12 of LRH-1 was introduced in the context of a VP16 activation domain chimera. The ability of wild type VP16LRH-1 or the VP16LRH-1ΔC to interact with Gal4-mSHP and hSHP was examined using the mammalian two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig.2, VP16LRH-1 showed a strong interaction with both of the Gal-SHP proteins, which was completely eliminated by the AF-2 mutation in VP16LRH-1ΔC. In agreement with these results,35S-labeled murine SHP interacted efficiently in vitro with a bacterially expressed GST-LRH-1 fusion but not with GST-LRH1ΔC (Fig. 3A). The ability of the truncated mSHPW160X to interact with GST-LRH-1 was also assessed. This mutant retained significant binding as expected from previous results, although this was decreased somewhat (∼13% retention of input of wild type SHP and 8% SHPW160X, Fig.3A). The human mutant protein hSHPR213C was also tested for its interaction with LRH-1 using the mammalian two-hybrid system. The interaction of hSHPR213C with LRH-1 was indistinguishable from that of wild type SHP (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Interaction of wild type and mutant SHP withLRH-1. A, upper panel, interaction between mouse SHP or SHPW160X and LRH-1 in GST pulldown assays. GST alone and GST-LRH1 and GST-LRH1ΔC fusion protein were expressed in E. coli, purified, bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and tested for interaction with [35S]methionine-labeled SHP or SHPW160X prepared by coupled in vitro transcription and translation. Bound proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The same amount of loading of GST fusions was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining. Bottom panel, the intensities of the specific bands were quantitated using a PhosphorImager. The percent retention was determined by comparison to the marked 25% input. B, interaction of human SHP or the SHP R213C mutant with LRH-1 in mammalian cells. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with 50 ng of Gal4hSHPWT or Gal4hSHPR213C, 50 ng of VP16 alone or VP16LRH-1, 200 ng of Gal4TK luciferase reporter, and 150 ng of TKGH as an internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously described a modified mammalian two-hybrid approach to assess the ability of a third protein to affect the interaction between two Gal4 and VP16 chimeras (6Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We used this approach to test whether SHP and coactivators compete for interaction with LRH-1. A relatively strong transactivation was observed when Gal4SRC-3(RID), a chimera containing the receptor interaction domain of the p160 coactivator SRC-3 (also known as ACTR, p/CIP, RAC-3, AIB-1, TRAM-1) was coexpressed with VP16LRH-1 in HepG2 cells, indicating a strong interaction of LRH-1 with SRC-3 (Fig.4A, bar 4 andB, bar 2). No such interaction was observed with the GalSRC-3(RID) and VP16LRH-1ΔC, confirming that the AF-2 surface is required for this interaction (data not shown). As described previously (6Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), a transcriptional activation domain was incorporated into the VP16-SHP fusion used for competition to counteract the SHP expression function. Thus, the inhibitory effects observed are not a consequence of incorporation of the SHP repression function into a ternary complex. Increasing amounts of transfected VP16mSHP (Fig.4A, bars 5–7) or VP16hSHP (Fig. 4B,bars 3 and 4) strongly decreased the LRH-1-SRC-3 interaction, indicating that SHP can compete for LRH-1 binding with SRC-3. The same result has been obtained with increasing amounts of SHP. Increasing levels of mSHPW160X also decreased this interaction, but in agreement with the biochemical results, they were less efficient than the wild type SHP. In contrast, hSHPR213C competed with SRC-3 for binding to LRH-1 as efficiently as wild type hSHP (Fig. 4B,bars 3 and 4 with bars 5 and6), indicating that this mutation does not affect receptor binding. The orphan nuclear receptor SHP lacks a DNA-binding domain and exerts its inhibitory effects through protein-protein interactions (1Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D.

These data are consistent with previous results found with other receptors and the initial descriptions of the functional interaction of the two orphan receptors (7Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R.

However, several considerations suggested the possibility that the interactions of these two unusual orphans might differ from those described previously for SHP. As a monomer, the interactions of LRH-1 with both DNA and coactivators must differ from those of the much larger group of receptors that function as dimers. Thus, the effects of SHP on these interactions might be expected to differ from those exerted on the dimeric receptors. This is particularly clear for SF-1, which has been shown to have unusual cofactor interactions (16Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-VanHouten D.L. Flanagan J.N. Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and transactivation functions (17Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 521-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) that may be linked to the unexpected absence of inhibitory effects of SHP. In the absence of characterization LRH-1 transactivation, the mechanisms of its inhibition by SHP remain uncertain. The fact that this inhibition has been proposed to play a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism clearly highlights the importance of defining its molecular basis. The results described here demonstrate that SHP directly targets the AF-2 surface of LRH-1 and competes with coactivators for binding to the same surface. Once bound to the target receptor and recruited to DNA, the autonomous repression function of SHP further contributes to the overall inhibitory effect. Both of these effects are similar to those described for other receptors, and we conclude that the two-step mechanism for repression is a general feature of SHP inhibition of transactivation mediated by both dimeric and monomeric nuclear receptors. The molecular basis for the function of the SHP repression domain remains unknown. To date, we have not been able to demonstrate significant interaction between SHP and previously identified corepressors including NCoR, SMRT, mSin3, or histone deacetylases. In addition, trichostatin A, a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase activity, has no apparent effect on the SHP repression. Although negative, these results suggest that SHP exerts its repressive effects on target gene promoters by a mechanism distinct from those previously described for nuclear hormone receptors. It is intriguing that in this scenario the repressed state, which results from SHP binding to an activated receptor, could be quite different from that engendered by the absence of ligand for thyroid hormone receptor or retinoic acid receptor, for example. Recently, a heterozygous loss of SHP gene function was associated with a mild form of obesity in a number of Japanese subjects (18Nishigori H. Tomura H. Tonooka N. Kanamori M. Yamada S. Sho K. Inoue I. Kikuchi N. Onigata K. Kojima I. Kohama T. Yamagata K. Yang Q. Matsuzawa Y. Miki T. Seino S. Kim M.Y. Choi H.S. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This finding suggests a function for SHP in metabolic regulation beyond the effects on cholesterol metabolism predicted from its effects on LRH-1 (7Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R.

Whereas more detailed functional studies will be required to elucidate the physiologic functions of SHP, the nature of these human gene mutations may provide some insights into SHP repression. Several of the mutations are large truncations, but three of them are point mutations that affect a relatively short span of the repression domain (amino acids 189–213). Like the more severe mutations, all of these SHP point mutants are defective in the repression of HNF-4 transactivation. As indicated by the results described here, one of the mutations (hSHPR213C) probably has a general effect on the autonomous repression function. Further characterization of the specific functional effects of these mutations may lead to insights into the mechanism of repression by SHP. The interaction between SHP and LRH-1 shares both interesting similarities and apparent differences with the previously described interaction between DAX-1 and SF-1 (23Ito M. Yu R. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Based on both structural similarity and direct sequence comparisons (41% identity in the ligand-binding domains), DAX-1 is the closest relative to SHP. SF-1 and LRH-1 are even closer relatives with a 53% identity in the ligand-binding domain and 90% identity in the DNA-binding domain, accounting for their highly similar DNA-binding specificity. Both SHP and DAX-1 inhibit transactivation of their specific nuclear receptor targets, and both interact with receptor ligand-binding domains via LXXLL-related motifs similar to those present in p160 and other coactivators (20Zhang H.

In addition, both SHP and DAX-1 harbor autonomous repression functions that are located in the C-terminal region, and mutations that specifically affect this region have been identified in human populations (3Seol W.

However, the inhibitory targets of DAX-1 appear far more restricted than those of SHP. In addition, DAX-1 has been reported to recruit corepressors such as NCoR and Alien, and DAX-1 does not require the AF-2 surface of SF-1 for interaction and repression (24Crawford P.A. Dorn C.

Focusing further studies on these issues may either narrow the differences or highlight their functional significance."
https://openalex.org/W2049530394,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a multifunctional growth factor with important roles in development, cell proliferation, and matrix deposition. It signals through the sequential activation of two serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type I and type II receptors. A third cell surface receptor, betaglycan, serves as a co-receptor for TGF-β in some cell types, enhancing TGF-β-mediated signaling. We have examined the function of betaglycan in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells that lack endogenous betaglycan. We demonstrate that the expression of betaglycan in LLC-PK1 cells results in inhibition of TGF-β signaling as measured by reporter gene expression, thymidine incorporation, collagen production, and phosphorylation of the downstream signaling effectors Smad2 and Smad3. In comparison, the expression of betaglycan in L6 myoblasts enhances TGF-β signaling, which is consistent with the published literature. The effects of betaglycan in LLC-PK1 cells are not mediated by ligand sequestration or increased production of a soluble form of the receptor, which has been reported to serve as a ligand antagonist. We demonstrate instead that in LLC-PK1 cells, unlike L6 cells, expression of betaglycan prevents association between the type I and type II TGF-β receptors, which is required for signaling. This is a function of the glycosaminoglycan modifications of betaglycan. Betaglycan in LLC-PK1 cells exhibits higher molecular weight glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains than in L6 cells, and a GAG− betaglycan mutant does not inhibit TGF-β signaling or type I/type II receptor association in LLC-PK1cells. Our data indicate that betaglycan can function as a potent inhibitor of TGF-β signaling by a novel mechanism and provide support for an essential but complex role for proteoglycan co-receptors in growth factor signaling. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a multifunctional growth factor with important roles in development, cell proliferation, and matrix deposition. It signals through the sequential activation of two serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type I and type II receptors. A third cell surface receptor, betaglycan, serves as a co-receptor for TGF-β in some cell types, enhancing TGF-β-mediated signaling. We have examined the function of betaglycan in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells that lack endogenous betaglycan. We demonstrate that the expression of betaglycan in LLC-PK1 cells results in inhibition of TGF-β signaling as measured by reporter gene expression, thymidine incorporation, collagen production, and phosphorylation of the downstream signaling effectors Smad2 and Smad3. In comparison, the expression of betaglycan in L6 myoblasts enhances TGF-β signaling, which is consistent with the published literature. The effects of betaglycan in LLC-PK1 cells are not mediated by ligand sequestration or increased production of a soluble form of the receptor, which has been reported to serve as a ligand antagonist.

Biological effects of TGF-β are achieved through the sequential activation of two high affinity serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type II (TβRII) and the type I (TβRI) TGF-β receptors. TGF-β signaling is initiated by the binding of TGF-β to TβRII followed by the formation or stabilization of TβRI-TβRII complexes, transphosphorylation of TβRI by TβRII, and phosphorylation of the receptor-associated cytoplasmic effector molecules Smad2 and Smad3 by TβRI (1Massague J.

A third TGF-β transmembrane receptor, the type III receptor or betaglycan, is a widely expressed heparan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that binds TGF-β with high affinity through its protein core but has no apparent intrinsic signaling activity (4Wang X.F.

Betaglycan is believed to be a co-receptor for TGF-β. In several cell lines, including rat L6 myoblasts lacking endogenous betaglycan, it significantly increases the affinity of TβRI and TβRII for TGF-β, thereby enhancing the response to TGF-β (4Wang X.F.

Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In addition, betaglycan eliminates differences in efficacy among the three TGF-β isoforms. TGF-β2, which binds to TβRI and TβRII with low affinity and has minimal growth inhibitory effects in the absence of betaglycan, behaves similarly to TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 in the presence of betaglycan (8Lopez-Casillas F.

In normal development, betaglycan is required for the mesenchymal transformation of AV cushion myocytes, probably because it enhances signaling by local TGF-β2 (11Brown C.B. Boyer A.S. Runyan R.B. Barnett J.V. Science. 1999; 283: 2080-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that the mechanism of this enhancement of TGF-β2 signaling is an interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of betaglycan and the autophosphorylated TβRII kinase domain (12Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Pepin M.C. Beauchemin M. Moustakas A. Lodish H.F. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 25: 25Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence, however, that the function of betaglycan is more complex. Although normally membrane-anchored, betaglycan can undergo proteolytic processing in vivo, resulting in the secretion of a soluble ectodomain. This ectodomain can both enhance and inhibit signaling, depending on the concentration of TGF-β present (13Fukushima D. Butzow R. Hildebrand A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22710-22715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although in most cases it is believed to bind and sequester TGF-β, functioning in effect as a receptor antagonist (5Lopez-Casillas F.

Recently, however, betaglycan has been shown to play an inhibitory role in the function of the TGF-β superfamily member activin by binding to the activin antagonist inhibin, enabling it to recruit the activin type II receptor and prevent activin binding (17Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many cell types and tissues express high levels of betaglycan, yet are poorly responsive to TGF-β (4Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A.

To better understand the function of betaglycan, we studied its biological effects in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells. We demonstrate that these cells have very low levels of endogenous betaglycan and that expression of betaglycan in these cells inhibits TGF-β signaling. This inhibition is not caused by enhanced secretion of soluble betaglycan and sequestration of ligand. Rather, betaglycan, as a function of its glycosaminoglycan modifications, prevents the physical association of TβRI and TβRII and thereby prevents the initiation of downstream signaling. An N-terminally HA-tagged rat betaglycan receptor (20Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) was inserted into vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for subsequent use and is designated TβRIIIwt. A cytoplasmic deletion mutant lacking residues 812–853 (the entire cytoplasmic tail; TβRIIIΔcyto) was constructed by PCR mutagenesis, as was a mutant with serine to alanine mutations at positions 535 and 546 (TβRIIIΔgag), eliminating the two glycosaminoglycan attachment sites (16Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Sequences of all mutants were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (Yale Keck Center). Primer sequences for PCR reactions are available upon request. LLC-PK1 cells (ATCC CL-101), derived from porcine proximal tubule epithelium, were cultured in α minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes, and 10 mm l-glutamine. L6 rat myoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm l-glutamine. Stable expression of the wild-type HA-tagged rat betaglycan, the cytoplasmic deletion mutant, or pcDNA3 was achieved in LLC-PK1 or L6 cells (ATCC CRL-1458) by transfection with FuGENE 6 (L6; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (LLC-PK1; Invitrogen), respectively, and selection with G418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen). For all experiments described, pools of 20–40 isolated, antibiotic-resistant colonies were used within several passages of isolation, and expression was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Mv1Lu cells were cultured as described (21Wells R.G. Yankelev H. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11444-11451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with p3TP-Lux (22Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pAP1-luc (Stratagene), or pSBE4-luc (23Zawel L.

Cells were treated with the indicated concentration of TGF-β1, and luciferase activity was measured in total cell lysates after 24 h. Luciferase activities were normalized by transfection controls (24Eickelberg O. Pansky A. Mussmann R. Bihl M. Tamm M. Hildebrand P. Perruchoud A.P. Roth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded onto 60-mm cell culture dishes and allowed to reach 80% confluence. Cells were then stimulated with TGF-β1 or -β2 at the indicated concentrations, and nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared. In brief, cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of low salt buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmNaVO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and a set of proteinase inhibitors, CompleteTM). After 10 min of incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 1 min (4 °C), and the supernatants (cytosolic extracts) were immediately frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 120 μl of high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, and supplemented with CompleteTM), and nuclear proteins were extracted by shaking on ice for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min (4 °C), and the supernatants were taken as nuclear extracts. Protein concentrations of all samples were determined by standard Bradford assay. Aliquots of cell extracts were applied to 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and run at 25 mA of constant current for 3 h at room tempterature. After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted on nitrocellulose transfer membranes overnight with 1 mA/cm2 at 4 °C. Membranes were then probed with antibodies against the indicated Smads at room temperature for 1 h. Specific bands were visualized using the ECL system (Pierce). LLC-PK1 cells were seeded into 24-well plates in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (40 pm) for 16 h, as indicated. Cells were pulsed with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 4 h, and incorporation of radioactive label into newly synthesized DNA was analyzed by trichloracetic acid precipitation and liquid scintillation counting. LLC-PK1 or L6 cells were cultured to subconfluence in 12-well plates, stimulated with TGF-β1 (40 pm), and pulsed with [3H]proline (0.5 μCi/ml) for 24 h. Supernatants were then removed and cells lysed and extracellular matrix proteins were fixed in 70% ethanol. Collagen deposition was determined by differential collagenase digestion and liquid scintillation counting, as described (25Eickelberg O. Pansky A. Koehler E. Bihl M. Tamm M. Hildebrand P. Perruchoud A.P. Kashgarian M. Roth M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Iodination of TGF-β1 (R & D Systems) and affinity labeling of L6, Mv1Lu, and LLC-PK1 cell lines were performed as described (21Wells R.G. Yankelev H. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11444-11451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For labeling of soluble betaglycan, cells were incubated in serum-free media for 24 h. Media were collected and centrifuged to remove detached cells and were concentrated using a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon). After equalization of protein concentration, detergent lysates of labeled cells or culture supernatants were immunoprecipitated with antibodies recognizing the HA tag of betaglycan, the type II TGF-β receptor (α-IIC), or the type I receptor (21Wells R.G. Yankelev H. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11444-11451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For double immunoprecipitation experiments, affinity-labeled LLC-PK1 expressing betaglycan were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the HA epitope and the ectodomain of betaglycan (R & D Systems) and were eluted by boiling in 0.5% SDS. A portion of the eluant was then diluted in lysis buffer and reprecipitated with the same antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and specific bands were visualized by autoradiography. We studied TGF-β signaling in LLC-PK1 cells, which are highly responsive to TGF-β but have very low expression of betaglycan as determined by TGF-β affinity labeling (Fig.1a), Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and Northern analysis (Ref. 4Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, and data not shown). Cells were stably transfected with full-length wild-type rat betaglycan (TβRIIIwt), with a mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain (TβRIIIΔcyto), or with expression vector alone (pcDNA). TGF-β responsiveness in these cell lines was then analyzed using the three luciferase reporter constructs p3TP-lux, pAP-1, and pSBE4. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, treatment of vector-transfected cells with 40 pm TGF-β1 for 24 h significantly increased reporter gene expression (14.4-fold, 5.5-fold, and 10.4-fold for p3TP-lux, pAP-1, and pSBE4, respectively, p > 0.001 for all) (Fig. 1, b–d). TGF-β1-mediated reporter gene expression was significantly reduced, however, in cells transfected with either TβRIIIwt or TβRIIIΔcyto (Fig. 1, b–d,p > 0.001). Similar inhibitions for all three reporter gene constructs were observed in LLC-PK1 cells transiently transfected with betaglycan expression constructs and in cells expressing non-epitope-tagged betaglycan constructs (data not shown). Betaglycan expression also inhibited TGF-β-mediated biological effects. TGF-β-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis was reduced in LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing either full-length or truncated betaglycan compared with those expressing vector alone (Fig.2A). Similarly, TGF-β1-mediated collagen deposition was suppressed when cells expressed either TβRIIIwt or TβRIIIΔcyto (Fig. 2B). In contrast, L6 myoblasts, which also lack endogenous betaglycan (4Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 26Rotzer D. Roth M. Lutz M. Lindemann D. Sebald W. Knaus P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), demonstrate enhanced TGF-β1-induced collagen deposition in the presence of either betaglycan construct (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with published data using L6 and other mesenchymal cell lines that demonstrate increased TGF-β signaling associated with betaglycan expression (4Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 8Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results thus far demonstrate that betaglycan is a potent inhibitor of TGF-β signaling in LLC-PK1 cells and that this response is independent of the cytoplasmic domain. Dose-response relationships demonstrate that inhibition of TGF-β activity results from an overall loss of TGF-β responsiveness in cells expressing betaglycan and not from decreased ligand affinity (Fig. 3). As assayed by p3TP-lux reporter gene activity, the EC50 for TGF-β1 was ∼4 pm in LLC-PK1 cells expressing vector or either betaglycan construct. If betaglycan reduced affinity or sequestered ligand, it would be expected to increase the EC50 rather than reduce efficacy. Similar EC50 and dose-response relationships were observed with TGF-β2 treatment (data not shown). Betaglycan-mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling appears to be a direct effect. In the TGF-β signaling pathway, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic signaling molecules Smad2 and Smad3 by TβRI is the first step in signal transduction. LLC-PK1 cells expressing betaglycan demonstrate a clear reduction in Smad2/3 phosphorylation compared with cells expressing vector alone (Fig.4). Of note, total levels of Smad2 and Smad3 are not altered by the expression of betaglycan. The full-length membrane-anchored betaglycan can undergo proteolysis with secretion of a soluble ectodomain. In some systems, soluble betaglycan can bind and sequester active TGF-β, thereby reducing the cellular effect. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that this is not the mechanism for betaglycan inhibition of TGF-β signaling in LLC-PK1cells. In the dose-response curve shown in Fig. 3, a change in EC50 rather than a change in efficacy would be expected if soluble rather than membrane-anchored betaglycan mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling. Additionally, we analyzed cell lysates and culture supernatants from both L6 and LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing betaglycan. As shown in Fig.5, L6 and LLC-PK1 cells expressing full-length betaglycan produce comparable amounts of the soluble ectodomain, suggesting that the production of the soluble receptor is unlikely to account for the inhibition of TGF-β signaling associated with betaglycan expression in LLC-PK1 cells. Consistent with this observation, neither supernatant collected from betaglycan-expressing LLC-PK1 cells (data not shown) nor recombinant-soluble betaglycan ectodomain inhibited TGF-β signaling in untransfected LLC-PK1 cells that do not express betaglycan (Fig. 6A). At TGF-β1 concentrations ranging from 4 to 400 pm, no inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling was observed by the addition of recombinant soluble betaglycan. In a control experiment to demonstrate the effects of ligand sequestration, addition of neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibody led to a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of p3TP-Lux activity in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 6B).Figure 6Recombinant soluble betaglycan fails to inhibit TGF-β-induced reporter gene expression in LLC-PK1 cells. Wild-type LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with p3TP-Lux and then stimulated with various concentrations of TGF-β1 (400, 40, and 4 pm), as indicated. For each concentration of TGF-β1, increasing amounts ofA, soluble recombinant betaglycan, orB, neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibody (both from R & D Systems) were added during the incubation period. Cells were harvested after 24 h, and the induction of p3TP-Lux activity was calculated as fold induction of reporter gene activity in unstimulated LLC-PK1 cells. Results were obtained in quadruplicate and are representative of two independent experiments using two different lots of recombinant soluble betaglycan.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has recently been shown that betaglycan can mediate inhibition of the superfamily member activin (17Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). This occurs through the formation of a complex between betaglycan, the activin type II receptor, and the activin antagonist inhibin. This complex prevents both binding of activin and recruitment of the activin type I receptor into an active signaling complex (17Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To determine whether betaglycan inhibits TGF-β signaling in LLC-PK1 cells by a similar mechanism, L6 and LLC-PK1 cells were affinity-labeled with125I-TGF-β1, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the three TGF-β receptors (Fig.7A). In L6 cells, immunoprecipitation with antibodies against TβRI or TβRII demonstrates co-immunoprecipitation of the two receptors, independent of betaglycan expression (compare lanes 1 and 2with 4, 5, 7, and 8). In LLC-PK1 cells expressing vector alone, immunoprecipitations demonstrate the existence of similar TβRI-TβRII complexes (lanes 10 and 11). In LLC-PK1 cells expressing full-length or truncated betaglycan, however, TβRI and TβRII do not co-immunoprecipitate, regardless of whether anti-type I or anti-type II receptor antibodies are used. No labeled TβRI could be detected by such co-immunoprecipitation experiments (lanes 13, 14, 16, and 17), although Western blot analysis revealed no change in the total levels of TβRI and TβRII with betaglycan expression (data not shown). Double immunoprecipitations with antibody against betaglycan indicate that the faster migrating species seen co-immunoprecipitating with betaglycan are primarily betaglycan species, not TβRI or TβRII (Fig.7B). Additionally, these species have slightly different molecular weights than TβRI and TβRII. Immunoprecipitations with antibody against TβRII demonstrate co-immunoprecipitation of TβRII and betaglycan (Fig. 7A, lanes 14 and17, and evident on shorter exposures), suggesting the preferential formation of TβRII-betaglycan complexes compared with TβRII-TβRI complexes. This lack of TβRI-TβRII complexes in betaglycan-expressing LLC-PK1 cells provides a mechanism to explain the observed decreases in phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Fig. 4) and inhibition of TGF-β signaling (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). We observed significant differences in the molecular weights of betaglycan expressed by LLC-PK1and L6 cells (Figs. 5 and 7). Both cell lines were transfected with the same cDNA, suggesting that differences in post-translational modification, specifically glycosaminoglycan chain addition, might account for variations in molecular weight. To test whether these differences might explain the different functions of betaglycan in L6 and LLC-PK1, we constructed a mutant betaglycan (TβRIIIΔgag) lacking both GAG attachment sites (althoughN-linked glycosylation sites remained). This mutant is expressed on the cell surface and binds TGF-β, as has been reported for a similar GAG mutant of betaglycan (Fig.8A and Ref. 16Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In rat L6 cells, TβRIIIΔgag functions similarly to TβRIIIwt, as assayed by luciferase reporter gene activity (data not shown). In LLC-PK1, however, TβRIIIΔgag lacks the inhibitory effect of TβRIIIwt on TGF-β signaling (Fig. 8B). These data demonstrate that the high molecular weight GAG modifications of betaglycan observed in LLC-PK1 but not L6 cells render it an inhibitory co-receptor in TGF-β signaling. Our results show that the expression of betaglycan inhibits TGF-β signaling in LLC-PK1 cells although it enhances TGF-β signaling in L6 cells. This is the first demonstration that full-length betaglycan can inhibit TGF-β signaling depending on the cell type, and it indicates that the function of this receptor is more complicated than previously assumed. The cleaved soluble ectodomain of betaglycan has been reported to inhibit TGF-β signaling by sequestering ligand, but this is clearly not the underlying mechanism for signaling inhibition by the full-length receptor because of the following: (i) the levels of soluble receptor are similar in both L6 and LLC-PK1 cells; (ii) the direct addition of soluble receptor to wild-type LLC-PK1 cells does not inhibit TGF-β signaling; and (iii) the kinetics of inhibition are not consistent with ligand sequestration by the soluble receptor. Furthermore, we could not detect direct interactions between TβRII and either a recombinant soluble betaglycan or the soluble receptor produced by LLC-PK1 (data not shown). Rather, our data demonstrate that membrane-anchored betaglycan prevents the association between TβRI and TβRII. Interestingly, this mechanism is similar to the one reported for inhibin antagonism of activin signaling. In that case, inhibin binds to betaglycan and the activin type II receptor, thereby preventing recruitment of the activin type I receptor and formation of a functional signaling complex (17Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that betaglycan enhancement of TGF-β2 signaling in L6 cells is a function of interactions between the cytoplasmic domain of betaglycan and the autophosphorylated TβRII kinase domain (12Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Pepin M.C. Beauchemin M. Moustakas A. Lodish H.F. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 25: 25Google Scholar). We have consistently observed the inhibition of TGF-β signaling in LLC-PK1 cells with the expression of both the full-length betaglycan and a truncated receptor lacking its cytoplasmic domain. Betaglycan-mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling was also observed with both TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, regardless of the presence of the cytoplasmic domain, suggesting that the inhibition described here is a function of the ecto- and transmembrane domains of betaglycan. Endoglin, a TGF-β-binding protein with 63% sequence similarity to betaglycan in its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (27Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Grimsby S. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1995-2001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits the response to TGF-β in many cell lines, including L6E9 rat myocytes, a cell line similar to the L6 used here (28Barbara N.P. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 584-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Domain-swapping studies in these cells localized the inhibitory effects of endoglin and the stimulatory effects of betaglycan to either the transmembrane or extracellular domain (29Letamendia A. Lastres P. Botella L.M. Raab U. Langa C. Velasco B. Attisano L. Bernabeu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), consistent with our results. Endoglin typically co-immunoprecipitates with both TβRI and TβRII, and binds TGF-β only in the presence of TβRII (28Barbara N.P. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 584-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 29Letamendia A. Lastres P. Botella L.M. Raab U. Langa C. Velasco B. Attisano L. Bernabeu C. J. Biol.

Endogenous endoglin and betaglycan co-immunoprecipitate in human microvascular endothelial cells (30Wong S.H. Hamel L. Chevalier S. Philip A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5550-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of additional mechanisms of regulating TGF-β activity (11Brown C.B. Boyer A.S. Runyan R.B. Barnett J.V. Science. 1999; 283: 2080-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We have clearly demonstrated that betaglycan GAG chains account for its inhibitory activity in LLC-PK1 cells because mutations to remove the GAG attachment sites changed the effect of betaglycan on TGF-β signaling. Correspondingly, TβRIIIΔgag, in contrast to the wild-type receptor, had no effect on TβRI/TβRII association in co-immunoprecipitation assays in LLC-PK1 cells. Variable modification of heparan sulfate proteoglycans has been shown to influence the biological activity of FGF-2 (31Fiore M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), although betaglycan is to our knowledge the first receptor shown to have opposing actions depending on its GAG chains. Betaglycan has two GAG sites that have been shown to be specific for either heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate GAG chains (16Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Although we have not determined whether either one or both sites are responsible for the effects we see, it may well be the heparan sulfate site (Ser-535) because heparan sulfate chains on betaglycan have been shown in osteoblasts to be variable (6Andres J.L. Ronnstrand L. Cheifetz S. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23282-23287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the relative contributions of heparan and chondroitin sulfate chains to betaglycan function. We are also investigating the structural basis for the GAG effect and the possibility that GAG chain modification represents a mechanism whereby other growth factors influence TGF-β signaling. The actual nature of the interactions between betaglycan and TβRI and TβRII is not well understood. It has been clearly established that betaglycan and the type II receptor co-immunoprecipitate (9Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Henis Y.I. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22215-22218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), although immunofluorescence co-patching experiments with live cells suggest that the percentage of each receptor in a joint complex is very small. It should be noted, however, that the betaglycan-associated GAG chains in the COS7 cells used in the studies of Henis et al.(20Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) are of low molecular weight, and it is possible that co-patching studies performed with a cell line demonstrating higher molecular weight betaglycan GAG chains would produce different results. The degree of betaglycan/TβRII coimmunoprecipitation is low even in LLC-PK1 cells, where TβRI/TβRII interactions are disrupted. The details of the interaction between betaglycan and the other TGF-β receptors are poorly understood in any cell line, regardless of whether betaglycan enhances or inhibits TGF-β signaling. Our data have significant implications for the understanding of betaglycan function and the regulation of TGF-β-induced responses in different cell types. In particular, our results suggest an explanation for observed differences in TGF-β responsiveness between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Mesenchyme-derived cells including mesangial cells, which are generally poorly responsive to TGF-β, express high levels of betaglycan. 3O. Eickelberg and R. G. Wells, unpublished observations. There are examples in the literature that correlate increased TGF-β responsiveness with decreased betaglycan expression, or vice versa (33Ji C. Chen Y. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30487-30494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These are physiologically relevant models for further studies investigating the function of betaglycan, as are cell types in which betaglycan expression changes dramatically during differentiation (34Centrella M. Casinghino S. Kim J. Pham T. Rosen V. Wozney J. McCarthy T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines and tissue types in which betaglycan has an inhibitory role need to be identified, as the loss of betaglycan in these cells predicts a significant enhancement of the cellular response to TGF-β.

To determine the consequences ofT. cruzi invasion on host cell gene expression, high density microarrays consisting of ∼27,000 human cDNAs were hybridized with fluorescent probes generated from T. cruzi-infected human fibroblasts (HFF) at early time points following infection (2–24 h).

Trypanosoma cruzi is a hemoflagellate protozoan parasite that causes Chagas' disease in humans. Key steps in the pathogenesis of disease include host cell penetration by T. cruzi and replication in the host cell cytoplasm. Host cell invasion, which is initiated following attachment of motile T. cruzitrypomastigotes to the host cell surface, is a slow, active process requiring ∼5–10 min for completion (17Rodrı́guez A. Samoff E. Rioult M.G. Chung A. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Parasite internalization coincides with the formation of a nascent parasitophorous vacuole, generated as a result of targeted fusion of host cell lysosomes with the plasma membrane (18Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J.E. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways that are rapidly activated in both the host cell and the parasite are known to regulate T. cruzi entry into mammalian cells. (19Burleigh B.A. Andrews N.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although not well characterized, some of these early signals are thought to regulate downstream host cell transcriptional events (20Huang H. Calderon T.M. Berman J.W. Braunstein V.L. Weiss L.M.

Gazzinelli R.T. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although T. cruzi is able to maintain an infection cycle in non-professional phagocytic cells of the host for several months during the acute phase of infection, little is known regarding parasite-directed modifications in the cellular environment that are required to support infection by this pathogen. To further dissect the molecular events regulating early T. cruzi-host cell interactions, we have employed cDNA microarray hybridization to define the temporal host cell transcriptional response induced by infection with T. cruzi trypomastigotes. To facilitate comparisons to existing microarray data bases, which define temporal host cell transcriptional responses to the intracellular pathogens, Toxoplasma gondii (14Blader I.J. Manger I.D. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24223-24231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and human cytomegalovirus (6Zhu H. Cong J.P. Mamtora G. Gingeras T. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14470-14475Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were used in this study. We report here that infection of HFF by the intracellular pathogenT. cruzi results in very few changes in transcript abundance for at least the first 6 h of infection. As compared with the rapid changes in host cell transcript abundance elicited by other intracellular pathogens, T. cruzi is highly unique in its ability to initiate the infectious process without inducing gene expression. LLcMK2, HeLa cells, and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF, passages 10–16) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine. Tissue culture-derived trypomastigotes from the T. cruzi Y strain were generated as previously described (33Caler E.V. Vaena de Avalos S. Haynes P.A. Andrews N.W. Burleigh B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4975-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Parasite-conditioned media (PCM) was prepared by resuspending freshly harvested and washed trypomastigotes in DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum at 2 × 107 parasites/ml for 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Following the incubation, parasites were removed by centrifugation, and the resultant PCM supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane. Trypomastigotes were added to monolayers of HFF in T75 flasks and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1–2 h, after which parasites were removed and fresh DMEM/2% fetal bovine serum was added. To ensure infections of at least 1 parasite/cell on average, HFF were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 10 unless otherwise stated. To quantitate infection, 12-mm2 glass coverslips with infected cells were removed from flasks prior to cell lysis, fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, processed, and scored by immunofluorescence assay as described previously (18Tardieux I. Webster P. Ravesloot J. Boron W. Lunn J.A. Heuser J.E. Andrews N.W. Cell. 1992; 71: 1117-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Mock/PCM-treated and T. cruzi-infected monolayers were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline on ice. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a Beckman DU 530 spectrophotometer and stored at −80 °C at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. RNA integrity was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. A series of cDNA microarrays containing ∼27,000 human sequences were prepared at Stanford University (14Blader I.J. Manger I.D. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24223-24231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). All clones on the microarray are available at Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Fluorescent (Cy5- or Cy3-labeled) cDNA probes were generated from total RNA exactly as described (14Blader I.J. Manger I.D. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24223-24231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Typically, Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP were used to label cDNA generated from infected and control uninfected cells, respectively. Images generated by scanning glass slide microarrays were analyzed with the Scanalyze software (written by M. Eisen, available at rana.Stanford.edu/software) to determine the -fold change for each spot on the array. The fluorescence intensities of the remaining spots were normalized using previously described methods (34Alizadeh A. Eisen M. Davis R.E. Ma C. Sabet H. Tran T. Powell J.I. Yang L. Marti G.E. Moore D.T. Hudson Jr., J.R. Chan W.C. Greiner T. Weisenburger D. Armitage J.O. Lossos I. Levy R. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Staudt L.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The data were filtered to exclude spots with intensities less than twice the background (150 pixels) in either channel. Hierarchical clustering of the data was performed using the Cluster program and the figure generated using TreeView (also available at rana.Stanford.edu/software) (56Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg/lane) was size-fractionated on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels in MOPS buffer and blotted onto a nylon membrane using standard protocols. Human cDNA clones, β-actin (National Institutes of Health IMAGE: 867606), ISG54 (IMAGE: 289496),IRP1 (IMAGE: 502355), and CTGF (IMAGE: 898092), were obtained from ATCC. Murine STAT-1 cDNA was kindly provided by J. Rengarajan (Harvard School of Public Health). HumanIFNβ was PCR-amplified using forward: 5′-cagctctttccatgagctac-3′ and reverse: 5′-agtgtcctttcatttgcagt-3′ primers. Plasmid DNA was isolated using QIAprep (Qiagen). Clones were sequenced for verification and inserts excised and gel-purified. A 15- to 25-ng insert was used as template to synthesize32P-labeled probes (RediPrime II, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and hybridized using Express-Hyb (CLONTECH). Blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at −80 °C. Prior to subsequent probing, blots were stripped by washing at 95 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10–20 min. Infected cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) and lysed with TBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm E-64, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. 10 μg of protein was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with TBS/0.1% Tween 20/3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibodies to human STAT-1 (Transduction Laboratories), or phospholipid scramblase (Oncogene Research Products) for 1 h in blocking buffer followed by incubation with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) following exposure to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Blots were stripped with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, at 50 °C for 30 min prior to reprobing. Secreted IFNβ was measured in cell supernatants using an antibody-specific ELISA kit (BIOSOURCE International). 500-μl aliquots of supernatant were collected from control, PCM-treated, or T. cruzi-infected monolayers at 1-h intervals for 24 h and centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. A linear calibration curve, 3–400 units/ml, was generated using standard concentrations of IFNβ. Optical density was measured at 450 nm using a Spectra Max 190 ELISA reader (Molecular Devices). The global transcriptional response elicited in human fibroblasts to infectiveT. cruzi trypomastigotes was determined using cDNA microarray hybridization. For these experiments, cDNA probe pairs, generated from control (Cy5-labeled) and T. cruzi-infected (Cy3-labeled) human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) at 2, 4, 6, and 24 h post-infection (hpi), were hybridized to microarrays containing ∼27,000 human sequences. Data were filtered to include only those spots for which the Cy3/Cy5 ratio was ≥2 (putative up-regulation) or ≤0.5 (putative repression) in at least two of three experiments. Surprisingly, none of the genes represented on the microarrays were significantly induced in HFF at time points of infection between 2 and 6 h (1 parasite/cell on average) whereas six genes were reproducibly repressed at these time points (Fig.1). Highly similar results were obtained in supplementary microarray experiments carried out at 6 hpi, in which HFF sustained a much higher infection (∼4 parasites/cell; not shown). In contrast to the minimal response observed early in infection, transcript abundance for 106 HFF genes was significantly elevated at 24 hpi. Of these transcripts, 82 correspond to annotated genes (shown in Fig. 1) and 24 are expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Most of the ESTs are unknown sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers: H60297,W93154, AA236015, AA706818, AA490264, AA418828, AA142842, AA682834,AA133281, R89126, AA707117, H72638, R63922, AA776775, AA281936,AA250751, AA699983, AA448192, H23443, and H11453). Four ESTs show significant sequence similarity to known genes: EST AA169606:basic leucine zipper nuclear factor 1/JEM-1; EST AA454209:periplakin; EST AA983252: IL-6/G-CSF family member SGRF; and EST R68721: TNF ligand. Control microarray experiments were performed to ensure that apparent changes in transcript abundance were not due to cross-hybridization with T. cruzi cDNA. For these, arrays were hybridized with Cy5-labeled HFF cDNA and Cy3-labeled cDNA consisting of HFF:T. cruzi (4:1) generated to mimic the estimated amount of parasite RNA present in samples prepared from infected cells. No cross-hybridizing signals were detected in experiments carried out using the lower multiplicity of infection conditions. In contrast, cross-hybridizing T. cruzi sequences were detected in array experiments when HFF were heavily infected. Data for these spots (GenBankTM accession numbers: AA708441, H50886, R52793) were eliminated from the analysis. Nine independent microarray hybridizations were carried out at the 24-h time point, and the resultant data were used to determine the level of reproducibility between experiments. The frequency with which an individual gene is represented as undergoing a >2-fold induction was plotted as a function of the number of experiments for which a similar change in expression was observed (Fig.2). We found that, of the genes meeting the initial filtering criteria in at least one experiment, 93% were induced in at least six of nine (67%) experiments and more than half were represented in every experiment. The remaining 7% are likely to represent one of the following: 1) false positives; 2) genes for which data was unavailable in several experiments (i.e. poor spot quality); or 3) genes for which the level of change was near the 2-fold cutoff such that, in some of the experiments, the Cy3/Cy5 ratio was below this value. By carrying out multiple independent infection and microarray hybridizations, a transcriptional response profile has been generated for which a high degree of reproducibility was observed. This was particularly important for the early time points of infection where the response to T. cruzi was minimal, thereby providing an increased level of confidence in the data. These results are further supported by comparing the global transcriptional response induced in HFF by T. gondii (>60 genes up-regulated at 2 hpi) using the same generation of microarrays (14Blader I.J. Manger I.D. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24223-24231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The most highly induced and widely represented transcripts at 24 hpi belong to the family of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG). Among these are: ISG54(22.0-fold), STAT-1 (6.9-fold), phospholipid scramblase (6.9-fold), MHC class I (2.6-fold), and two interferon (IFN) regulatory factors, IRF2 (7.7-fold) andIRF7 (2.3-fold). The abundance of ISG transcripts was unchanged at early time points of infection, suggesting that this response may follow IFN production by infected HFF. The remaining transcripts induced at 24 hpi are grouped into categories that include: receptors and signal transduction (8.6%), metabolism (5%), transcription (5%), extracellular matrix (2.5%), ESTs (27.5%), and others (15.5%). Although these latter transcripts were consistently up-regulated in independent experiments, the genes have no obvious functional relationship to each other. This classification is arbitrary and limited due to incomplete knowledge of the full spectrum of functions exerted by most gene products. With the exception ofIL-6, which was up-regulated in only five of nine experiments (and therefore not included in Fig. 1), no pro-inflammatory cytokines genes were induced in response to T. cruzi, contrary to what has been reported in other cell types (25Machado F.S. Martins G. Aliberti J.C.S. Mestriner F. Cunha F.Q. Silva J.S. Circulation. 2000; 102: 3003-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 35Camargo M.M. Almeida I.C. Pereira M.E.S. Ferguson M.A.J. Travassos L.R. Gazzinelli R.T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5890-5901PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most striking features of the response to T. cruzi is the apparent absence of transcriptional activation at early time points of infection (2–6 h). In contrast to this, a subset of host cell transcripts was repressed in the 2-fold range at these time points (Fig. 1). Three of these genes,CTGF, Cyr61, and ADAMTS-1, encode secreted heparin-binding, extracellular matrix-associated proteins (36Chen C.C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar,37Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although CTGF and Cyr61 are functionally related immediate/early genes belonging to the CCN family of secreted growth factors (36Chen C.C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), their expression is differentially regulated during T. cruzi infection. Repression of CTGF was maintained at 24 hpi, whereas Cyr61 was no longer repressed at this time point (Fig. 1). At 24 hpi, only three genes were reproducibly repressed: CTGF, IRP-1, andoxytocin receptor, each of which exhibits a different temporal response to infection. Six additional transcripts were repressed at 24 hpi under conditions of increased infection (4 parasites/cell). These are: EST AA485974: macrogolgin; ESTT57691: putative tumor suppressor; ESTs N26517 and W56371:similar to p53; and ESTs T67066 and H97386: unknown. Shedding of glycoconjugates from infective T. cruzi trypomastigotes into the medium (parasite-conditioned medium (PCM)) has been described previously (38Andrews N.W. Hong K.S. Robbins E.S. Nussenzweig V. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 64: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of soluble parasite factors toward this global host cell transcriptional response, microarray experiments were carried out in which Cy5- and Cy3-labeled probes were prepared from PCM-treated and T. cruzi-infected cells, respectively, at 24 hpi. The results showed that, with one exception, similar changes in relative transcript abundance were seen when RNA from infected cells was compared with RNA from PCM-treated or mock-infected cultures (data not shown). The one exception was CTGF, which was equally down-regulated in its abundance in PCM-treated as in infected cultures. These data indicate that soluble T. cruzi components released into the medium mediate repression of CTGF but not the other changes in transcript abundance observed at 24 hpi, including ISG induction. The relative expression of five representative host cell genes (induced:ISG54 and STAT-1; no change:β-actin; repressed: IRP-1, CTGF) was analyzed in independent infection experiments by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3A). Similar to the microarray findings, significant induction of ISG54 andSTAT-1 transcripts was observed at 24 hpi but not at 2 hpi, when compared with uninfected controls. Likewise, the IRP-1transcript was significantly diminished following T. cruziinfection for 24 h, with no discernable change detected at 2 hpi. Also, in agreement with the microarray analysis, PCM treatment of HFF for 24 h lead to a decrease in CTGF transcript levels in HFF, comparable to the repression observed following T. cruzi infection for 2 and 24 h. PCM treatment did not alter expression of ISG54, STAT-1, or IRP-1. Parasite RNA did not cross-react with any of the probes used (not shown). The trend of induction/repression for each gene change identified by microarray was corroborated by the Northern blot analysis with more pronounced changes in the latter (Fig. 3A) as shown by others (14Blader I.J. Manger I.D. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24223-24231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To determine whether changes in transcript abundance correlated with increased protein expression, Western blot analysis was performed to examine the relative abundance of STAT-1 and another ISG, phospholipid scramblase (PS) in uninfected and T. cruzi-infected HFF. A significant increase in STAT-1 and PS protein levels was observed at 24 hpi but not at 2 or 4 h when compared with uninfected HFF (Fig. 3B). Overall, both Northern and Western blot analyses provide independent confirmation of microarray data for the induction and repression of several host cell genes in response to T. cruzi infection. Using independent methods, we have demonstrated that T. cruzi infection of HFF results in increased ISG expression at 24 hpi. ISGs are rapidly induced (within 6 h) in response to interferon (39Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar) or directly by certain viruses (6Zhu H. Cong J.P. Mamtora G. Gingeras T. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14470-14475Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). ISG transcript abundance was not significantly altered inT. cruzi-infected cells <6 hpi, indicating that this is a secondary response to parasite infection, possibly involving the production of fibroblast interferon, IFNβ. Because IFNβ cDNA was not represented on the microarrays, it was not possible to determine whether IFNβ transcription was induced in response to T. cruzi infection by this analysis. Therefore, the relative expression of IFNβ in control and parasite-infected HFF was examined by Northern blot analysis. An abundant IFNβ transcript was detected in T. cruzi-infected HFF at 17 hpi but not in uninfected cells or at 2 hpi (Fig.4A). Secretion of IFNβ into the culture supernatant was first detected by ELISA at 18 hpi and could be measured until 24 h, the last time point examined (Fig.4B). No IFNβ was detected in medium alone, medium from mock-infected HFF, or from the parasites (not shown). T. cruzi-secreted/released components present in PCM failed to stimulate IFNβ secretion from HFF (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the presence of intracellular parasites is required. A survey of existing microarray data bases documenting host cell transcriptional responses to bacterial, fungal, viral, and protozoan pathogens, in a variety of mammalian cell types, reveals that a general feature of host-pathogen interactions is the relatively rapid induction of host cell gene expression (3Chang Y.E.

By a combination of two-hybrid and phage-display approaches, we have identified six new ligands of the Abp1-SH3 domain. None of these SH3-mediated novel interactions was detected in recent all genome high throughput protein interaction projects. Here we show that the SH3-mediated association of Abp1p with the Ser/Thr kinases Prk1p and Ark1p is essential for their localization to actin cortical patches. The Abp1-SH3 domain has a rather unusual binding specificity, because its target peptides contain the tetrapentapeptide +XXXPXXPX+PXXL with positive charges flanking the polyproline core on both sides. Here we present the structure of the Abp1-SH3 domain solved at 1.3-Å resolution. The peptide-binding pockets in the SH3 domain are flanked by two acidic residues that are uncommon at those positions in the SH3 domain family. We have shown by site-directed mutagenesis that one of these negatively charged side chains may be the key determinant for the preference for non-classical ligands.

We have shown by site-directed mutagenesis that one of these negatively charged side chains may be the key determinant for the preference for non-classical ligands. The actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in many essential cellular processes, such as motility, endocytosis, secretion, and membrane recycling (1Sorkin A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4375-4376PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tang H.Y., Xu, J. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 12-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F111-F116Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). As a consequence, its organization and dynamic rearrangements need to be tightly controlled spatially and temporally. A thorough understanding of the interaction network connecting all the actin-associated proteins, the scaffolds and the anchoring proteins, is likely to help to clarify the mechanisms underlying its coordinated regulation (4Westphal R.S. Soderling S.H. Alto N.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4589-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Most of the components of the yeast cell cytoskeleton have homologues in mammals where they often play similar roles (5Balguerie A. Sivadon P. Bonneu M. Aigle M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wendland B. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D.

Abp1p 1The abbreviations used are:Abpactin-binding proteinArkactin-regulating kinaseGSTglutathioneS-transferaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent protein (actin-binding protein) is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein homologue to the mouse mAbp1p-SH3P7, which is a Src kinase target involved in polarized cell growth and motility (8Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nature Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 9Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 393-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The yeast Abp1 protein is 592 amino acids long and includes an actin depolymerizing factor-homology domain at the N terminus and a SH3 domain at the C terminus of the protein (10Lappalainen P. Kessels M.M. Cope M.J. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Abp1p is found concentrated in the actin patches that are enriched at the sites of polarized cell surface growth in the bud of budding yeast and in the mating projection of mating yeast. The overexpression of Abp1p disturbs the actin cytoskeleton and leads to an aberrant budding pattern and cortical actin assembly (11Drubin D.G. Miller K.G. Botstein D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2551-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Deletion of the ABP1 gene, on the other hand, does not cause any apparent cytoskeletal defect (12Lila T. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Abp1p, however, is found to be essential when any of the genes encoding for Sac6p (the actin filament-bundling protein, fimbrin), Sla1p, Sla2p, or Prk1p is deleted (13Cope M.J. Yang S. Shang C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1203-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 51Holtzman D.A. Yang S. Drubin D.G. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 122: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These proteins, which functionally interact with Abp1p, are also localized in the cortical actin cytoskeleton (11Drubin D.G. Miller K.G. Botstein D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2551-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 13Cope M.J. Yang S. Shang C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1203-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The observed negative synergism in yeast cells carrying combinations of deletions in ABP1-SH3 and in theSLA1, SLA2, and SAC6 genes suggests that these gene products perform redundant essential function(s) that require the presence of an intact Abp1p-SH3 domain. Moreover, this synthetic lethality is not rescued by Abp1p devoid of its SH3 domain, suggesting a significant role for this protein interaction module (14Drubin D.G. Mulholland J. Zhu Z.M. Botstein D. Nature. 1990; 343: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). actin-binding protein actin-regulating kinase glutathioneS-transferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein To further characterize the role played by Abp1p, we have set out to identify its binding partners. More specifically, we have explored the role played by the SH3 domain in the assembly and regulation of these actin structures. The SH3 family of protein-protein interaction domains includes >1200 modules 60–70-amino acids long sharing an identity of at least 30%. More than 1000 proteins containing SH3 domains are found in many cell compartments and are involved in different functions (e.g. cell cycle control, signal transduction, or cytoskeleton organization). Typically, an SH3 domain recognizes and binds to polyproline-rich regions, which adopt a type II left-handed helix conformation (15Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Wu X. Knudsen B. Feller S.M. Zheng J. Sali A. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1995; 3: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The SH3 peptide recognition surface includes an hydrophobic cleft that binds to the proline-rich core and is flanked on one side by variable loops (RT and the N-Src loops) that contribute to the recognition specificity and determine ligand register and orientation (17Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O. Nature. 1994; 372: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 18Weng Z. Rickles R.J. Feng S. Richard S. Shaw A.S. Schreiber S.L. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A typical SH3 ligand contains a PXXP motif that is hosted in the hydrophobic cleft. Depending on the presence of a positive charge at the N or C terminus, the peptides bind in either of the two possible orientations and are classified as class 1 (RXXPXXPconsensus) or class 2 (PXXPXRconsensus). Recently, the recognition repertoire of the SH3 domain family has been shown to be more diverse than originally thought including atypical ligands, which do not contain positively charged residues that are proline-independent or tyrosine-based (19Mongiovi A.M.

In this study, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the Abp1p-SH3 domain, which accounts for its unusual recognition specificity. Furthermore, we have identified as Abp1-SH3 partners several proteins that were previously implicated in processes related to endocytosis. For two of these Abp1-SH3 partners, the serine/threonine kinases Ark1p and Prk1p, we have proved that in vivo Abp1p acts via its SH3 domain as an adaptor, which is essential for correct localization of the two kinases to cortical patches. Because Prk1p functions as a negative regulator of endocytosis, our results suggest that Abp1p links the cortical actin cytoskeleton to the control of endocytosis. The plasmids used as baits in two-hybrid screenings were pyABP, AmpR, ColE1ORI, TRP1, CEN6, and GAL4BD (aa 1–147) fused toABP1-SH3 and pyABPm from pyABP, encoding the Abp1-SH3-mutated in W569A. The SH3 domain (Pro-535-Asn-592) was amplified from yeast DNA using the oligonucleotides R403 (AAAGCgaattcAAAATCCTTGGGCCACAG) inserting an EcoRI site and R404 (GACGTgagctcCTAGTTGCCCAAAGACAC) inserting a SacI site. The yeast genomic library was cloned into pACT, AmpR, ColE1 ORI,LEU2, and GAL4AD (amino acids 768–881) fused to yeast genomic DNA fragments [CLONTECH].The selection was performed in Hf7c or in Y-190 [CLONTECH]. The β-galactosidase test in liquid was performed after transformation into Y-187 according to the protocol by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). The positive control plasmids were from CLONTECH, such as pCL1 expressing GAL4 full-length, pVA3–1 expressingGAL4BD (amino acids 1–147) fused to murine p53 (amino acids 72–390), and pTD1–1 expressing GAL4AD (amino acids 768–881) fused to SV40 large T antigen (amino acids 87–708). All prey plasmids were found to be negative when tested with pLAM5 expressing GAL4BD fused to human lamin C protein. The positive interactors in Fig. 1 showed a β-galactosidase activity that is 100–400 times higher than that of the negative control (0.003 units). Plasmid pyArc40 was used for the test with Arc40p from pACT2 andARC40 inserted into BamHI-XhoI, which was fused to GAL4AD using the oligonucleotides R804, AATTTggatccCATGTCATTTTCCAATTCTAAAGAC, and R805, AATTTaagcttTTAAATTGTATAAATGACGATCTTA.

Fragments (50–1000 bp) of yeast DNA obtained by random priming with partially degenerated oligonucleotides were cloned into the phagemid vector Pc89 between the EcoRI andBamHI sites at the 5′ end of M13 geneVIII, which encodes the major coat protein (22Felici F. Castagnoli L. Musacchio A. Jappelli R. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The library that we obtained (108 independent clones representing >50 times of the whole genome) was a collection of recombinant phage particles displaying yeast protein fragments of which average length was 40 amino acids. These particles were affinity-selected for their ability to bind to the full-length yeast Abp1 protein expressed as a GST fusion and linked to glutathione S-Sepharose. 10 μg of GST-Abp1p were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1010 recombinant filamentous phage particles displaying yeast protein fragments. Unbound phages were discarded by washing the resin with 1× Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Affinity-selected clones were amplified in a bacterial host DH5α and subjected to a new affinity selection cycle. After the third cycle, selected clones were tested by ELISA for their capability of interacting with GST-Abp1p, and the sequence of the yeast DNA fragments were determined by automatic sequencing of phage single-stranded DNA using universal primer −40. The Abp1-SH3 fusion to GST was in PYEX(ABP1-SH3), a pGEX2T derivative in which the SH3 domain (Pro-535-Asn-592) was inserted into EcoRI-SacI, with oligonucleotides R403 and R404. The oligonucleotides R649 (TATATggatccATGGCTTTGGAACCTATT) and R650 (TCTGTgaattcGTTGCCCAAAGACACATA) were used to insert the ABP1gene cloned into pGEX6P-1 (EcoRI-BamHI) to determine the synthesis of the bait protein Abp1p as a GST fusion. The GST-Abp1p fusion protein produced in the bacterial strain HB101 was immobilized on a glutathione-Sepharose resin. The bacterial strains used were DH5α (F′::supE44 (lacZYA-argFV169) deoR endA1 gyrA96 hsdR17 (r k− mk + ) recA1 relA1) and HB101 (supE44 hsdS20 (r-B m-B) recA13 ara-14 proA2 lacY1 galK2 rplS20 xil-5 mtl-1 leuB).

A nonapeptide repertoire of random sequence exposed on the pVIII coat protein of the filamentous phage M13 (1010 particles) were challenged with 10 μg of the purified GST-SH3 domain of Abp1p. After three rounds of affinity selection (8 h at room temperature in 1–2 ml of PBS), washing (10 ml of PBS + 0.005% Tween 20), elution (10 min at room temperature in 100 μl of 0.1 m HCl, pH 2.2), and neutralization (10 μl of Tris-HCl 2 m, pH 9.0), the specifically bound phages were recovered by infection. The single-stranded DNAs of the affinity-selected phage were sequenced to determine the sequence of the selected peptides. The yeast extracts were prepared from the kinase null strains as follows. The prk1 null strain DDY1558 was transformed with the following plasmids: pDD558 from pRS316, CEN, URA3, 6Myc-PRK1 (13Cope M.J. Yang S. Shang C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1203-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) expressing 6Myc-Prk1p under its own promoter; pDD561 from pTS408, GFP-PRK1-kinase-dead K56A, Gal promoter, CEN, URA3 (13Cope M.J. Yang S. Shang C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1203-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) expressing a GFP-tagged Prk1p under GAL promoter; and pDD961 from GFP-PRK1-kinase-dead K56A in which the P752PPK755 of Prk1p was mutated into alanines. The ark1 null strain DDY2115 was transformed with the following plasmids: pDD382 from pRS315, CEN, LEU2, ARK1–6Myc (13Cope M.J. Yang S. Shang C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1203-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) expressing a Ark1p-6Myc under its own promoter and pDD962 from pRS315, CEN,LEU2, ARK1–6Myc kinase-dead K56A in which the sequence Lys-608-Pro-626 of Ark1p-6Myc was substituted by two alanines. To perform the pull down experiment using mutations in the SH3 targets, the ark1 null strain was transformed with pDD962 expressing the Ark1p-6Myc devoid of its polyproline tail, otherwise cells were transformed with pDD961 encoding the GFP-Prk1p with a mutagenized proline stretch. pDD961 and pDD962 were both created using a PCR-stitch technique as follows. To make pDD961, two first-round of PCR reactions were performed using pDD554 (13Cope M.J. Yang S. Shang C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1203-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as template with primer pairs 1) AF19 and JC74 and 2) JC95w and JC75. The products from these reactions were pooled and amplified in a second round using AF19 and JC95w. pDD561 was digested with AflII and XbaI, and the removed fragment was replaced by similarly cut product from PCR round 2. A similar procedure was used to make pDD962 using pDD1160 (13Cope M.J. Yang S. Shang C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1203-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as template: SY47 and JC77 and JC76 and SY51 in the first round, SY47 and SY51 in the second round, and replacing an NcoI fragment in pDD1160. All mutations were verified by sequencing. As a bait for the pull down assay, the Abp1p-SH3 domain (Pro-535-Asn-592) in PYEX(ABP1-SH3) was expressed in Escherichia coli HB101 and purified as a fusion to GST. When using the mutated bait, pYEX(ABP1-SH3 W569A) was used. The conserved tryptophan 569 in the SH3 peptide-binding pocket was changed into alanine using the oligonucleotide R591 (TAGTTCCCCTAGCCACGCGTCATCGTCGACAAA). The GST-fused bait proteins were immobilized on glutathioneS-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) (30 μg) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with the concentrated extract (10 mg/ml) equivalent to 100 ml of cells at A 600 = 0.5. After extensive washing, the pellet is suspended in SDS and run on PAGE. The bands visible after immunoblotting with anti-Myc or anti-GFP antibodies were obtained loading the input extract from 10exp8 cells or the pulled down materials from 10exp9 cells. The Myc-tagged proteins were detected using the anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen), The GFP-tagged proteins were detected using the anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen). PYEX was a derivative of pGEX2TK with an expanded multiple cloning site. The yeast strains used in this study were DDY1558 (MATa prk1Δ::LEU2 his3–200 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 lys2–801 (Drubin laboratory)) and DDY2115 (MATa leu2 trp1 ura3–52 prb1–1122 pep4–3 pre1–451 ark1Δ::URA3 (Drubin laboratory)). Primers used were AF19 (ATACTAGTTAAAGAGTTCTGATGATC), JC74 (GGTAAAGATAAATCAAGACCACCACGTGCAGCAGCTGCACCACTACATTTAAGGACAGAAATTC), JC95w (GCTCTAGATTAAACTTTGCTGGGAAACC), JC75 (GAATTTCTGTCCTTAAATGTAGTGGTGCAGCTGCTGCACGTGGTGGTCTTGATTTATCTTTACC), SY47 (GATCTTGCCATATTAAGCGG), JC77 (GGATAACTTTCGTCCCGCGAGGAGCAGAGCAGCTGTTTTTTTGTCTTTTGAAATCGGGCC), JC76 (GGCCCGATTTCAAAAGACAAAAAAACAGCTGCTCTGCTCCTCGCGGGACGAAAGTTATCC), and SY51 (CGGAGCTCGGCAACCTTCATGCCTTATGC). Affinity selections with polyproline peptides were performed in microtiter plates (Nunc) coated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml of streptavidin (Sigma) in 100 μl of PBS (10 mmNa2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl). The coated plates were washed 10 times with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with biotinylated peptides (10 μm in PBS). Plates were washed again and blocked for 1 h at 25 °C with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The GST-SH3 fusion proteins were added (1 μg). After 10 washes, anti-GST serum in goat (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was added in bovine serum albumin and 4% PBS for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with anti-goat alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma). The ELISA-utilizing phage-exposed peptides were performed using 10exp9 phage particles/well. Abp1 null cells, DDY322, were co-transformed either with pDD561 encoding GFP-Prk1p (kinase-dead version) or with pDD562 encoding GFP-Ark1p (kinase-dead version) together with one of the following Abp1p expression vectors: pDD187 from pRS315, CEN, ABP1 full-length, AmpR, LEU2, HIS3; pDD188 from Abp1p-SH3 deleted (12Lila T. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); and pyABPSH3mut from pDD189 in which the ABP1-SH3, mutated in W569A, is inserted intoSphI-NcoI site with oligonucleotides AAATccatggGCCACAGC and ACTTAgcatgcCTAGTTGCC. The expression of the GFP-tagged proteins was induced from a GAL1–10 promoter as in Copeet al. (13Cope M.J. Yang S. Shang C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1203-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized 16 h after transfer from medium containing glucose to that containing galactose as a carbon source. When using the polyproline-mutated version of Prk1p, DDY130 cells were transformed with pDD961 encoding kinase-dead Prk1p with proline residues 752–755 changed into alanines under the Gal promoter. The yeast strains used in this study were DDY322 (MATα abp1::LEU2 his3−Δ200 ura3–52 leu2,3112(Drubin laboratory)) and DDY130 (MATa his3Δ200 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 lys2–801 Parental wild type strain (Drubin laboratory)). The SH3 domain (Pro-535-Asn-592) of Abp1p was cloned into the pRSETA (NdeI/HindIII) Invitrogen expression vector using the oligonucleotides R553 and R508. The protein was expressed in Bl21pLysS (Promega) induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected and sonicated 10 times for 10 s in 50 mm Tris-Hcl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation at 45,000 rpm to remove cell debris, the supernatant was loaded onto Q-Sepharose high performance column (XK 26/20). The protein was concentrated with 80% ammonium sulfate, spun in a vivaspin concentratop (10,000 MWCO) (Sartorius), and further purified on Hiload XK 16/60 Superdex 75 (size exclusion). The peak fractions were concentrated to 10 mg/ml and used for crystallization. Abp1-SH3 domain was crystallized by the sitting-drop technique using 3.2 m ammonium sulfate in 100 mmbis-Tris-propane at pH 8.0 as a precipitating agent and 12 mg/ml Abp1-SH3 domain in the purification buffer. The crystals were optimized by seeding techniques and reducing the protein concentration to 1.2 mg/ml. X-ray data were collected at 100K at the Beamline BW7B (EMBL/DESY, Hamburg) using a 345-MAR research image plate as detector. The high concentration of ammonium sulfate was sufficient to cryoprotect the crystal. The data were processed with the Denzo and Scalepack package (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; A 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to the P212121 space group with unit-cell parameters a = 24.0 Å, b = 38.1 Å, and c = 59.1 Å. The Wilson plot, calculated in the resolution range of 3.9–1.3 Å using the program TRUNCATE from the CCP4 package (28CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

The observed data between 15 and 3.5 Å resolution were used employing an integration sphere of 12 Å. The final solution had a correlation coefficient of 32.7 and a R-factor of 51.9%. The structure was built using an ARPwARP package (30Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) and refined using REFMAC5 (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

The data set contained 13,742 unique reflections from which 687 were excluded for the calculation of theR free (32Kleywegt G.J. Brunger A.T. Structure. 1996; 4: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). One molecule of 58 residues (497 non-hydrogen protein atoms) is present in the asymmetric unit. Anisotropic refinement of the individual atoms was applied, which further improved the statistics. The weighted 3F o − 2F c electron density map displayed 11 residues in double conformations. The solvent molecules presenting reasonable hydrogen bonds (2.3–3.3 Å) were added using the option Arp solvent from the ARPwARP package. Two large tetrahedral-like electron density peaks were interpreted as sulfate ions from the crystallization conditions. Finally, the structure was validated by the program PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A.

However, we have recently demonstrated the feasibility of achieving similar goals by panning phage-displayed libraries in which cDNA or genomic fragments are fused to phage capsid genes (34Zucconi A. Dente L. Santonico E. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have observed that the two methods are partly complementary, and that a search carried out with a specific bait domain by both methods results in a better coverage of the ensemble of potential partners (3535. Tong, A. H. Y., Drees, B., Nardelli, G., Bader, G., Castagnoli, L., Evangelista, M., Ferracuti, S., Nelson, B., Paoluzi, S., Quondam, M., Zucconi, A., Hogue, C., Fields, S., Boone, C., and Cesareni, G. (2001) Science, in press.Google Scholar). By applying such a combined approach to the SH3 domain of Abp1, we have identified seven prey proteins, which were selected by either method (Table III). Our results confirm that the Abp1-SH3 binds to the adenylyl cyclase-associated protein Srv2 (12Lila T. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, our two-hybrid screen also identifies the open reading frame product Yir003wp, the unconventional myosin Myo5p, and the kinase Prk1p as putative partners of Abp1p. Using the entire Abp1p as a bait, we have also screened a yeast genomic library displayed on filamentous phage capsids obtained by fusing random fragments of the yeast genome to the 5′ end of f1 gene VIII. This approach permitted us to identify a second Ser/Thr kinase, Ark1p, as an Abp1-SH3 ligand. The 247 amino acid N-terminal catalytic domain of Ark1p is 73% similar to the catalytic domain of Prk1p. The two kinases aside from a similar C-terminal proline-rich sequence are otherwise rather divergent (13Cope M.J. Yang S. Shang C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1203-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The Ark1p peptide region selected by phage display corresponds to amino acids Arg-561-Leu-627 (Fig. 1) in which two putative SH3-binding motifs are present. Because the fragment of Ark1p was selected by panning phage-displayed libraries, we can exclude the possibility that the interaction between the Ark1p kinase and the SH3 domain is bridged by a third protein.Table IIIList of prey proteinsSelected Protein3-aList of prey proteins selected by two-hybrid technique (Srv2p, Prk1p, Myo5p, Yir003p) or by affinity selection of phage displayed yeast genomic peptides (Ark1p, Sjl2p, Ynl094wp).Selected Region3-bAmino acid range of the selected peptides. > indicates the C terminus of the protein.FunctionSrv2p160 >Adenylyl cyclase-associated proteinPrk1p290 >Protein serine/threonine kinaseMyo5p854 >Microfilament motorYir003wp297 >Hypothetical open reading frameArk1p561 – 627Protein serine/threonine kinaseYnl094wp471 – 504Protein of unknown functionInp52p/Sjl2p1109 – 1137Synaptojanin-like3-a List of prey proteins selected by two-hybrid technique (Srv2p, Prk1p, Myo5p, Yi"

Chk2−/− ES cells are defective in maintaining ionizing radiation (IR)1-induced G2arrest, and Chk2 null thymocytes fail to stabilize p53 and to induce G1 arrest and apoptosis (1Hirao A. Kong Y.Y.

Chk2 has also been reported to directly phosphorylate BRCA1 and to regulate its response to DNA damage (2Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Moreover, heterozygous mutations in the Chk2 gene have been identified in a subset of patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (3Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E.

Chk2T68 mutants show reduced Chk2 kinase activation and a diminished induction of the p53-dependent G1 arrest in response to ionizing radiation (5Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K.

The phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr68 in response to IR is ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated)-dependent, although an ATM-independent pathway exists in response to ultraviolet radiation (UV) and hydroxyurea (HU) treatment (4Ahn J.Y.

However, little is known how Chk2 activation is initiated or how the activity of Chk2 is down-regulated following DNA repair. Given the physiological impact of the DNA damage pathway in genome stability and cancer prevention, it is necessary to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying DNA damage signal transduction. Here we show that the Thr68-phosphorylated form of Chk2 (Chk2T68P) forms distinct nuclear foci in response to ionizing radiation. Only this activated form localizes at sites of DNA strand breaks. The kinase activity of Chk2 and the number of Chk2 foci formed depend on the severity of DNA damage and gradually decrease with time. Together, our findings suggest that Chk2 activity is initiated and regulated at the sites of DNA strand breaks in response to ionizing radiation.DISCUSSIONOur data show that phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 by ATM correlate with the severity of DNA damage in vivo. The activated form of Chk2 localizes in distinct foci at the sites of DNA strand breaks within minutes following ionizing radiation. The disappearance of these foci coincides with that of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 and correlates with the reported time course of DNA repair (8Kodym R. Horth E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1995; 68: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Nunez M.I. Villalobos M. Olea N. Valenzuela M.T. Pedraza V. McMillan T.J. Ruiz de Almodovar J.M. Br. J.

The phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 by ATM occurs most likely at the sites of DNA breaks. First, ATM can be directly activated by DNA breaks in vitro (14Smith G.C. Cary R.B. Lakin N.D. Hann B.C. Teo S.H. Chen D.J. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11134-11139Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Chan D.W. Son S.C. Block W. Ye R. Khanna K.K. Wold M.S.

Second, following DNA damage, ATM co-localizes with γ-H2AX foci in vivo (16Andegeko Y. Moyal L. Mitelman L. Tsarfaty I. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38224-38230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether ATM directly phosphorylates Chk2 or this phosphorylation event requires a mediator. In budding yeast, phosphorylation and activation of the Chk2 homologue scRad53 by Mec1, an ATM homologue, require scRad9, a protein with C-terminal tandem BRCT motifs (BRCA1 C-terminus). It is intriguing that phosphorylated Chk2 co-localizes with 53BP1, a protein also containing C-terminal tandem BRCT motifs. It remains to be determined whether the phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 requires 53BP1 in mammals.The phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr68 does not correlate with the ATM-dependent mobility shift of Chk2 following ionizing radiation. While Chk2T68 phosphorylation is rapid and transient (see Fig. 1 C), the mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Chk2 appears to be gradual and persists at least 24–48 h following DNA damage (17Buscemi G. Savio C. Zannini L. Micciche F. Masnada D. Nakanishi M. Tauchi H. Komatsu K. Mizutani S. Khanna K. Chen P. Concannon P. Chessa L. Delia D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5214-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Indeed, a Chk2T68A mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated at Thr68 and is defective in activation following DNA damage, still shows the same mobility shift on SDS-PAGE as wild-type Chk2 (5Matsuoka S.

Thus, the mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Chk2 depends largely on the phosphorylation of sites distinct from Thr68. While Thr68phosphorylation of Chk2 correlates with the activation of Chk2 (4Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936PubMed Google Scholar, 5Matsuoka S.

One possibility is that this mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Chk2 represents a certain negative feedback mechanism. Such complex regulation of kinase activity by various phosphorylation events has been documented for Raf-1 protein kinase. While Raf-1 is initially activated by specific phosphorylation events, the subsequent mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 down-regulates Raf-1 activity and represents a negative feedback mechanism contributing to the desensitization of the signaling pathway (for example, see Ref. 18Wartmann M.

Similar feedback mechanism may exist for Chk2 in the DNA damage-signaling pathway. Chk2 (Cds1), an evolutionary conserved protein kinase, is an important component of the DNA damage response pathway. Chk2−/− ES cells are defective in maintaining ionizing radiation (IR)1-induced G2arrest, and Chk2 null thymocytes fail to stabilize p53 and to induce G1 arrest and apoptosis (1Hirao A. Kong Y.Y.

Chk2 has also been reported to directly phosphorylate BRCA1 and to regulate its response to DNA damage (2Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Moreover, heterozygous mutations in the Chk2 gene have been identified in a subset of patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (3Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E.

The activation of Chk2 in response to DNA damage requires phosphorylation at threonine 68 (Thr68) (4Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E.

Chk2T68 mutants show reduced Chk2 kinase activation and a diminished induction of the p53-dependent G1 arrest in response to ionizing radiation (5Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr68 in response to IR is ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated)-dependent, although an ATM-independent pathway exists in response to ultraviolet radiation (UV) and hydroxyurea (HU) treatment (4Ahn J.Y.

However, little is known how Chk2 activation is initiated or how the activity of Chk2 is down-regulated following DNA repair. Given the physiological impact of the DNA damage pathway in genome stability and cancer prevention, it is necessary to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying DNA damage signal transduction. Here we show that the Thr68-phosphorylated form of Chk2 (Chk2T68P) forms distinct nuclear foci in response to ionizing radiation. Only this activated form localizes at sites of DNA strand breaks. The kinase activity of Chk2 and the number of Chk2 foci formed depend on the severity of DNA damage and gradually decrease with time. Together, our findings suggest that Chk2 activity is initiated and regulated at the sites of DNA strand breaks in response to ionizing radiation. DISCUSSIONOur data show that phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 by ATM correlate with the severity of DNA damage in vivo. The activated form of Chk2 localizes in distinct foci at the sites of DNA strand breaks within minutes following ionizing radiation. The disappearance of these foci coincides with that of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 and correlates with the reported time course of DNA repair (8Kodym R. Horth E. Int. J. Radiat.

The phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 by ATM occurs most likely at the sites of DNA breaks. First, ATM can be directly activated by DNA breaks in vitro (14Smith G.C. Cary R.B. Lakin N.D.

Second, following DNA damage, ATM co-localizes with γ-H2AX foci in vivo (16Andegeko Y. Moyal L. Mitelman L. Tsarfaty I. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38224-38230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether ATM directly phosphorylates Chk2 or this phosphorylation event requires a mediator. In budding yeast, phosphorylation and activation of the Chk2 homologue scRad53 by Mec1, an ATM homologue, require scRad9, a protein with C-terminal tandem BRCT motifs (BRCA1 C-terminus). It is intriguing that phosphorylated Chk2 co-localizes with 53BP1, a protein also containing C-terminal tandem BRCT motifs. It remains to be determined whether the phosphorylation and activation of Chk2 requires 53BP1 in mammals.The phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr68 does not correlate with the ATM-dependent mobility shift of Chk2 following ionizing radiation. While Chk2T68 phosphorylation is rapid and transient (see Fig. 1 C), the mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Chk2 appears to be gradual and persists at least 24–48 h following DNA damage (17Buscemi G.

The effects of cytokines on the regulation of CXCR4 function were investigated in human primary monocytes-macrophages. The expression of functional CXCR4 on the cell surface was demonstrated by the detection of ligand-induced Ca2+ mobilization, chemotaxis, and ligand-induced receptor endocytosis. Surface CXCR4 expression was down-regulated by cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-13, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and up-regulated by IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β1. Down-regulation was mediated post-translationally, in the absence of protein degradation, through an endocytotic mechanism. In contrast to SDF-1α-induced CXCR4 endocytosis, cytokine-induced endocytosis of this receptor was independent of actin filament polymerization. GM-CSF increased the expression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 (GRK3), β-arrestin-1, Pyk2, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Cytokine treatment also increased the total and tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of CXCR4 as well as the phosphorylation of FAK on tyrosine 397. It also induced the formation of GRK3·CXCR4 or FAK·CXCR4 complexes. Infection of macrophages by primary R5X4 and X4 isolates of HIV-1 was inhibited by IL-4, IL-13, and GM-CSF, an effect that was associated with down-regulation of surface CXCR4 expression. These data indicate that ligand-dependent and ligand-independent endocytoses of CXCR4 are mediated by different mechanisms.

Three types of HIV-1 isolates that infect macrophages have been identified and differ according to the chemokine receptor targeted for use as a viral coreceptor: (i) R5 viruses infect macrophages and primary CD4+ T cells through CCR5 and constitute the principal virus type transmitted in vivo, as indicated by the resistance to HIV-1 infection of individuals who lack functional CCR5(3–5). (ii) Primary X4 viruses that have not been subjected to extensive passage in vitro use CXCR4 as a coreceptor and infect primary CD4+ T cells, T cell lines, and macrophages (6Simmons G. Reeves J.D.

We have previously shown that cytokines and growth factors influence R5 HIV-1 infection in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) or T lymphocytes through modulation of CCR5 expression in both ligand-dependent (11Wang J.

Virol. 1998; 72: 7642-7647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) manners. The mechanism of ligand-induced endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is complex. Ligands induce the serine-threonine phosphorylation of GPCRs by GPCR kinase (GRK). The interaction of the phosphorylated receptor with β-arrestin then results in its sequestration into clathrin-coated pits (13Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L.

Cross-talk between different signaling pathways allows for integration of the effects of multiple stimuli received by cells in various physiological and pathological situations. For example, stimulation of GPCRs has been shown to trans-activate an epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent signaling pathway (27Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of GPCRs, especially that of chemokine receptors, is regulated by cytokines (12Wang J. Roderiquez G. Oravecz T. Norcross M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7642-7647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jourdan P. Abbal C. Noraz N. Hori T. Uchiyama T. Vendrell J.P. Bousquet J. Taylor N. Pene J. Yssel H. Nora N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4153-4157PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which GPCRs are regulated by cytokines, however, remains unknown. We have now investigated the effects of cytokines on CXCR4 expression and function in human primary macrophages and demonstrate that cytokines mediate sequestration of functional CXCR4 receptors in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent fashion. Human monocytes were isolated by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation from single-donor preparations of peripheral blood leukocytes, as described previously (11Wang J. Guan E. Roderiquez G. Norcross M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5763-5769PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wang J. Roderiquez G. Oravecz T. Norcross M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7642-7647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The monocyte preparations, which comprised >95% CD14+ cells, were cultured in macrophage serum-free medium (Macrophage-SFM, Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) in 24-well polystyrene culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). PM1 and H9 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). IFN-γ and IL-12 were kindly provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA) and Genetics Institute (Boston, MA), respectively; IL-4, IL-13, SDF-1α, SDF-1β, and rabbit affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to SDF-1α were from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ); and GM-CSF was from Immunex (Seattle, WA). IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, TGF-β1, and M-CSF were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Cytochalasin D, Wortmannin, herbimycin A, bisindolylmaleimide I, D609, and U-73122 were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Rabbit antibodies to phospho-FAK (Tyr397) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Unless indicated otherwise, all other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were stained with the 12G5(29) mAb to CXCR4 and then subjected to flow cytometry as described previously (11Wang J. Guan E. Roderiquez G. Norcross M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5763-5769PubMed Google Scholar). Primary R5X4 virus 92US076 (076), as well as primary X4 virus UG92046 (046), were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. MDMs cultured for 40 h with indicated cytokines or reagents were exposed to virus (20 ng/ml) for 4 h, after which the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then cultured in complete medium containing M-CSF (10 ng/ml) for an additional 7 days. Culture supernatants were collected and assayed for p24 with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Coulter, Hialeah, FL); absorbance at 650 nm was measured with a Vmax Kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were labeled with Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes), and the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was determined by measurement of fluorescence (excitation at 340 and 380 nm; emission at 510 nm) with a QuantaMaster luminescence spectrometer (Photon Technology International) as described previously (11Wang J. Guan E. Roderiquez G. Norcross M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5763-5769PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages were washed and resuspended (5 × 106 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Portions (100 μl) of the cell suspension were placed in the upper wells of Transwell chambers (Corning) containing bare filters with a pore size of 5 μm. The same medium (600 μl) supplemented or not with SDF-1α (1.5 μg/ml) was placed in the lower chambers. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C in a moist atmosphere containing 5% CO2, the number of cells that had migrated through the filter were counted with a FACSort (Becton Dickinson) for 30 s. In some experiments, cells were mixed with the 12G5 mAb to CXCR4 or with an isotype control and incubated for 30 min before loading into the Transwells. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cytokine-treated macrophages with the use of TRIzol (Life Technologies Inc.). The multiprobe hCR8 (PharMingen) was used for the T7 polymerase-directed synthesis of antisense RNA probes in the presence of 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and [α-32P]UTP. Equal amounts of total RNA were subjected to hybridization with the labeled probes overnight and then subjected to digestion for 30 min at 37 °C with a mix of RNase A and RNase T1 (PharMingen). Protected fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% acrylamide gel and exposed to x-ray film. Macrophages cultured on glass slides were fixed, permeabilized, and stained first with goat polyclonal antibodies to the COOH-terminal region of CXCR4 (C-20) and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled porcine antibodies to goat IgG. In some experiments, cells were stained with Oregon green 514-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cell surface and intracellular fluorescence was visualized with an LSM5 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Emission from fluorescein isothiocyanate (515–540 nm) and PE (560 nm) was detected after excitation at 488 and 533 nm, respectively. Nonspecific background fluorescence was determined by staining with labeled isotype control antibodies or with unlabeled control IgG followed by labeled secondary antibodies. Cells (∼1 × 107) were lysed and processed as previously described (30Wang J. Guan E. Roderiquiz G. Norcross M.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3360-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants of lysates were pretreated for 2 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) before incubation overnight with primary antibodies and protein G-Sepharose. For immunoblot analysis, cell lysate supernatants or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4 to 12% gradient gels, and processed as previously described (30Wang J. Guan E. Roderiquiz G. Norcross M.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3360-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Monocytes seeded in six-well dishes were incubated overnight with various cytokines and then labeled by incubation for 60 min at 37 °C with 1 ml of [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 in the absence of serum. Cells were then processed and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (31Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Zhang J. Cullen B. Cullen M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were solubilized in lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 8000 × g for 15 min. Equal volumes of the resulting supernatants were pretreated for 2 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose before incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of goat antibodies to the COOH-terminal region of CXCR4 (C-20). After the addition of protein G-Sepharose beads and incubation for an additional 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and immune complexes were solubilized in SDS sample buffer by incubation for 10 min at 80 °C. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4 to 12% gradient gel followed by autoradiography. The inability of laboratory-adapted X4 viruses to enter CXCR4+ MDMs suggests either that the CXCR4 expressed on these cells is defective for infection or that inhibitors of entry are present on MDMs but not on T cells. To assess the functional activity of CXCR4 in macrophages, we examined Ca2+ mobilization, modulation of CXCR4 expression, and chemotaxis induced by SDF-1α (Fig.1). The surface expression of CXCR4 was down-regulated by SDF-1α as well as by SDF-1β in MDMs as efficiently as it was in the T cell lines PM1 and H9 (Fig.1A). To verify that receptor-bound ligand did not interfere with the interaction of mAb 12G5 with CXCR4, we incubated SDF-1α-treated cells with (or without) glycine to remove the ligand from the receptor before staining with the antibody. The apparent expression of CXCR4 was not affected by glycine treatment (data not shown), indicating that SDF-1α does not interfere with the interaction of the 12G5 mAb, which recognizes a conformational epitope in CXCR4 extracellular loop 2 (32Brelot A. Heveker N. Adema K. Hosie M.J. Willett B. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Brelot A. Heveker N. Montes M. Alizon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23736-23744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), with CXCR4 on the cell surface. MDMs migrated toward SDF-1α (migration index 13.3), and migration was inhibited by 12G5 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, SDF-1α induced the mobilization of Ca2+ in both monocytes (data not shown) and MDMs (Fig. 1C). Together, these data indicate that CXCR4 expressed on the surface of MDMs is functional in terms of ligand-induced signaling and cell migration as well as receptor-mediated endocytosis. To characterize the effects of cytokines on the expression and function of CXCR4, we investigated whether cytokines modify the normal functions of CXCR4. Monocytes were treated with GM-CSF and then assayed for SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis and Ca2+ mobilization. Pretreatment of cells with GM-CSF inhibited chemotaxis toward SDF-1α (Fig. 1B) and prevented the SDF-1α-induced increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.1C). As controls, SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis was shown to be inhibited by mAb 12G5 to CXCR4, and Ca2+ mobilization in response to MnCl2 was not affected by pretreatment of cells with GM-CSF. To determine whether the inhibition by cytokines of SDF-1α-induced signaling and chemotaxis were attributable to a direct effect on CXCR4 expression, we measured surface expression of this receptor on macrophages that had been incubated in the absence or presence of various cytokines that regulate these cells. Cytokines could be divided into four groups on the basis of their effects on CXCR4 expression (Fig. 1D): (i) IL-4, IL-13, and GM-CSF each induced a >95% decrease in surface CXCR4 expression; IFN-γ also reduced CXCR4 expression, although to a lesser extent than did these other three cytokines, in contrast to its enhancing effect on CCR5 expression (34Hariharan D. Douglas S.D. Lee B. Lai J.P. Campbell D.E. Ho W.Z. Blood. 1999; 93: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). CXCR4 expression was no longer apparent after treatment of cells overnight with IL-4, IL-13, or GM-CSF at concentrations as low as 0.1 or 1 ng/ml (Fig. 1E). (ii) IL-10 and TGF-β1, which up-regulate CCR5 expression in MDMs, also enhanced CXCR4 expression in these cells. Of note, TGF-β1 also enhances CCR5 and CXCR4 expression in T cells (30Wang J. Guan E. Roderiquiz G. Norcross M.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3360-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The lipopolysaccharide-induced susceptibility of MDMs to infection by laboratory-adapted X4 viruses (35Moriuchi M. Moriuchi H. Turner W. Fauci A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1540-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) may thus result, in part, from the IL-10-induced up-regulation of surface CXCR4 expression. (iii) M-CSF, which up-regulates CCR5 expression in monocytes (12Wang J. Roderiquez G. Oravecz T. Norcross M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7642-7647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), induced a decrease in surface CXCR4 expression during the first 2 days of culture, but CXCR4 expression had returned to control values after 3 days of culture. (iv) IL-12 had no marked effect on CXCR4 expression. These results indicate that CXCR4 expression on the surface of macrophages is sensitive to the cytokine environment. The actions of cytokines in macrophages differ from those in lymphocytes, in which IL-13, GM-CSF, IL-10, M-CSF, and IFN-γ have no effect on CXCR4 expression (data not shown) whereas IL-4 up-regulates CXCR4 expression. We next investigated whether the inhibitory effect of cytokines on the expression of CXCR4 is mediated at the level of transcription or translation. The amount of CXCR4 mRNA and protein in MDMs was not affected by exposure to cytokines (Fig.2, A and B), indicating that down-regulation of surface CXCR4 expression by these cytokines is not mediated at the level of transcription and translation. Chemokines induce endocytosis of their receptors, a phenomenon that has been implicated in receptor regulation by reversible sequestration of receptors in endosomes or by proteolytic degradation of receptors in lysosomes. Given that cytokines were shown to reduce CXCR4 expression on the surface of macrophages without affecting the abundance of CXCR4 mRNA or total protein, we examined the effects of these agents on CXCR4 endocytosis. Cells were permeabilized, stained with antibodies to CXCR4, and observed with a confocal laser microscope. In untreated cells, CXCR4 was localized predominantly at the cell surface (Fig.2C). In contrast, in cells treated with GM-CSF, CXCR4 was localized to the region of the cytoplasm adjacent to the nucleus, a pattern that resembles that of CXCR4 immunofluorescence in cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or SDF-1α (36Signoret N. Rosenkilde M.M. Klasse P.J. Schwartz T.W. Malim M.H. Hoxie J.A. Marsh M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our immunoblot and confocal microscopy data thus indicate that CXCR4 is sequestered in the cytoplasm (probably in endosomes), rather than being proteolytically degraded in lysosomes, after stimulation of macrophages with cytokines. The plasma membrane is functionally integrated with the actin-based cytoskeleton (37Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The rearrangement of actin filaments may be essential for the trafficking of vesicles at the plasma membrane and within the cytoplasm (38Maples C.J. Ruiz W.G. Apodaca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6741-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To assess the role of actin filaments in endocytosis of CXCR4, we first examined the effect of GM-CSF on actin polymerization by confocal microscopy. GM-CSF was shown to induce the formation of actin filaments in MDMs (Fig. 3A). We next investigated the effect of pretreatment of cells with cytochalasin D, a cell-permeable inhibitor of actin polymerization, on the down-regulation of surface expression of CXCR4 induced by GM-CSF or SDF-1α (Fig. 3B). Cells treated with cytochalasin D for 17 h exhibited an increase in surface CXCR4 expression, probably as a result of inhibition of spontaneous endocytosis of this receptor. Endocytosis of CXCR4 induced by SDF-1α, but not that induced by GM-CSF, was completely blocked by pretreatment of cells with cytochalasin D, indicating that chemokine-induced, but not cytokine-induced, endocytosis of chemokine receptors is dependent on polymerization of actin filaments. We next examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation is required for ligand-induced or ligand-independent sequestration of CXCR4. Pretreatment of MDMs for 2 h with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A did not block the sequestration of CXCR4 induced by exposure to SDF-1α for 40 min (Fig.4A) or that of CCR5 induced by RANTES (data not shown), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is not necessary for the sequestration of chemokine receptors induced by their ligands. Monocytes were also pretreated for 2 h with herbimycin A before incubation overnight in the additional absence or presence of cytokines. Under these conditions, herbimycin A, which blocks protein-tyrosine phosphorylation induced by cytokines, induced a 2- to 4-fold increase in the surface expression of CXCR4; furthermore, this agent increased the surface expression of CXCR4 in cells exposed to IL-4 (data not shown), IL-13 (Fig. 4B), or GM-CSF by factors of 319, 112, and 60, respectively, compared with the corresponding values for cells treated with cytokine only. With a similar protocol, we also tested the effects of inhibitors of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC (PI-PLC), and protein kinase C (PKC) on cytokine-induced sequestration of CXCR4 (Fig. 4B). Neither the PC-PLC inhibitor (D609) nor the PI-PLC inhibitor (U-73122) affected the basal level of surface CXCR4 expression. Whereas U-73122 partially inhibited the down-regulation of surface CXCR4 expression induced by IL-13, D609 had no effect on this action of IL-13. Neither D609 nor U-73122 inhibited the down-regulation of surface CXCR4 expression induced by GM-CSF. The PKC inhibitor (bisindolylmaleimide I) increased slightly the extent of surface CXCR4 expression in cells incubated in the absence or presence of IL-13 or GM-CSF, but marked cytokine-induced down-regulation of CXCR4 was still apparent. The reduction in surface expression of CXCR4 induced by IL-4, IL-13, or GM-CSF was not affected by incubation of cells with neutralizing antibodies to SDF-1 (data not shown), indicating that this effect of these cytokines is not secondary to the induction of SDF-1 secretion. These data thus suggested that basal expression of CXCR4 on the cell surface is negatively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, and that tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for down-regulation of surface CXCR4 expression by IL-4, IL-13, or GM-CSF. Furthermore, PKC appears to play a minor role in the effects of these cytokines on surface CXCR4 expression. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin also increased slightly the basal expression of CXCR4 on the cell surface, but it did not markedly affect the down-regulation of surface CXCR4 expression induced by IL-4, IL-13, or GM-CSF (data not shown), indicating that PI3K also does not contribute to this action of these cytokines. Phosphorylation of GPCRs is thought to be essential for their ligand-induced endocytosis (39Tsao P. Cao T. von Zastrow M. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To examine whether CXCR4 is phosphorylated during cytokine-induced endocytosis in MDMs, we performed whole-cell phosphorylation experiments. CXCR4 exhibited a low level of phosphorylation in cells cultured in medium alone (Fig.4C). However, exposure of cells to IL-4 or GM-CSF resulted in a marked increase in the extent of CXCR4 phosphorylation. Given that cytokine-induced endocytosis of CXCR4 was blocked by herbimycin A, we examined whether CXCR4 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation during this process. Immunoblot analysis revealed that antibodies to phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitated CXCR4 from lysates of GM-CSF-treated MDMs but not from those of control cells (Fig.4D). These results thus suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of CXCR4 contributes to the cytokine-induced endocytosis of this receptor. Receptor"

Several investigators have shown that the terminal derivative of prostaglandin J2(PGJ2) metabolism, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15dPGJ2), induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells and is a potent activator of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), but 15dPGJ2 effects can be mediated by PPARγ-dependent and PPARγ-independent mechanisms.

Thus, it is critical to determine which mechanism(s) predominate to further develop these compounds as anticancer agents. These studies demonstrate that 15dPGJ2-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells requires expression of specific gene products. Blocking de novo mRNA and protein expression inhibited 15dPGJ2-induced apoptosis. Among the genes up-regulated by 15dPGJ2, which may account, at least in part, for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, are the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 Waf1/Cip1 (p21) and p27 Kip1 (p27). 15dPGJ2 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). 15dPGJ2 is rapidly interconverted to a mixture of at least five active isomers (29Maxey K.M.

Actinomycin D, cycloheximide, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, TNFα, staurosporin, and CD95/Fas ligand were purchased from Immunotech (St. Louis, MO). Caspase inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). For cell synchronization experiments, cells were synchronized as described previously (30Trimboli A.J. Waite B.M. Atsumi G. Fonteh A.N. Namen A.M. Clay C.E. Kute T.E. High K.P. Willingham M.C.

Cells were incubated with or with out actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (2 μg/ml) for 1 h and then exposed to 15dPGJ2 (10 μm) or vehicle (ethanol). After 36 h, cells were collected by trypsinization and pelleted, and the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using a TACS annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate kit (Trevegin, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Cells were incubated with or with out actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (2 μg/ml) for 1 h and then exposed to 15dPGJ2 (10 μm) or vehicle (ethanol).

Dual stained cells were washed and mounted under a glass coverslip, and digital images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiplan-2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with UV excitation filters and a Spot digital camera. Cells were incubated with or with out 15dPGJ2 (10 μm) for 2 h. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1.0 μg of total RNA was used to create radiolabeled cDNA by RT-PCR and hybridized to a Human Broad Coverage cDNA Array 1.2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Relative gene expression level and the mean from three separate experiments were determined using AtlasImage 2.0 software (CLONTECH). Relative gene expression level is highly reproducible between experiments (31Freeman W.M. Gioia L.

MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with or with out actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (2 μg/ml) for 1 h and then exposed to 15dPGJ2 (10 μm) or vehicle (ethanol). After 9 h, total protein was isolated in lysis buffer, and 50 μg of total protein was separated by gel electrophoresis in 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide precast gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Antibodies to p21 Waf1/Cip1 ,p27 Kip1, and procaspase-3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Bands were visualized using ECL-Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Kodak BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with or without actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (2 μg/ml) for 1 h and then exposed to 15dPGJ2 (10 μm) or vehicle (ethanol). After 2 h, total RNA was isolated in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 μg was separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to ZetaProbe GT membranes (Bio-Rad). cDNA probes to human p21 and β-actin were amplified by RT-PCR using Gene Amp Gold RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), cloned into TOPO cloning vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and labeled and hybridized using a Strip-EZ RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Autoradiograph images were obtained with BioMax film (Kodak) by overnight exposure at −70 °C. Cells were incubated with 15dPGJ2 (10 μm) with or with out the indicated caspase inhibitors (10 μm). After 36 h, phosphatidylserine translocation was determined by flow cytometry as described above, and immunoblotting for procaspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) expression was performed as described above. Previous experiments in our laboratory showed that MDA-MB-231 cells undergo apoptosis as early as 8 h after exposure to exogenous 15dPGJ2 (2Clay C.E. Namen A.M. Atsumi G. Willingham M.C. High K.P. Kute T.E. Trimboli A.J. Fonteh A.N. Dawson P.A. Chilton F.H. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the minimum amount of exposure time necessary to induce apoptosis. Cell growth was markedly inhibited after cells were incubated with 15dPGJ2 for as little as 2 h (Fig. 1 A). Incubation of cells with 15dPGJ2 or the phosphatase inhibitor staurosporin for 36 h induced marked apoptosis that was blocked by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, respectively (Fig. 1 B). However, TNFα and CD95/Fas ligand induced apoptosis only when RNA and protein synthesis was blocked. NFκB mediates a mechanism of protection via expression of cytoprotective genes, but TNFα pretreatment of breast cancer cells does not rescue cells from 15dPGJ2-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Further investigation showed that treatment of cells with 15dPGJ2 for as little as 5 h irreversibly induced apoptosis, which was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide (Fig. 1 C). Additionally, phosphatidylserine translocation and nuclear condensation, hallmarks of apoptosis, were attenuated when RNA or protein synthesis was blocked (Fig. 1 D) in 15dPGJ2-treated cells. Together these data show that early de novo transcription of genes is required for 15dPGJ2-induced apoptosis. Recently DuBois and colleagues (33Gupta R.A. Brockman J.A. Sarraf P. Willson T.M. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29681-29687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) investigated the expression of PPARγ target genes in colon cancer at 24 h and 6 days. Our data suggested that critical genes are transcribed much earlier. We investigated the 15dPGJ2-mediated expression of genes critical to apoptosis by differential display analysis at 2 h (Table I). The expression of gene products encoding proteins involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, including Bag-1, a promoter enhancer and Bcl2-binding protein; the cysteine protease caspases 3, 4, and 8; the transcription factors hEGR1, AP-1, and c-Jun; antioxidative genes heme oxygenase and SOD1; and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was increased ≥2.0-fold. Additionally, the expression of genes that are negative prognostic indicators in breast, colon, and liver cancer, including BRCA2, hepatoma-derived growth factor, and MCC, and genes involved in DNA maintenance and repair, including ERCC1, Rad52, Rad23A, DAXX, Dap3, DNA ligase 1, and GADD45 were decreased ≥1.5-fold. Thus, 15dPGJ2 likely exerts potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic responses, at least in part, via activation of genes critical to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.Table ISummary of gene expression after exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to 15dPGJ2 for 2 h15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 modulates the expression of critical cell cycle arrest and apoptosis genes.

Relative gene expression was determined using Atlas Image 2.0 and is reported as the mean from three separate experiments. Of the genes identified by differential display analysis, expression of p21 and p27 has clinical relevance in breast cancer. The expression of p21 and p27 is associated with better prognosis and disease-free survival of breast cancer (34Porter P.L. Malone K.E. Heagerty P.J. Alexander G.M. Gatti L.A. Firpo E.J. Daling J.R.

Cancer. 1999; 79: 1572-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, the p21 gene contains a potential conserved consensus PPARγ response element (PPRE) in the promoter region (36Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Although Fitzpatrick and colleagues (37Mullally J.E. Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30366-30373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) showed that p21 mRNA expression is not increased after 6 h of treatment in RKO cells with the 15dPGJ2 precursor Δ12-prostaglandin J2(Δ12PGJ2), we have observed activation of p21 mRNA as early as 2 h using 15dPGJ2. Consistent with this finding, 15dPGJ2 induces rapid and irreversible S phase arrest in synchronized breast cancer cells (Fig. 2 A), which correlated with the rapid expression of p21 and p27 protein (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, both actinomycin and cycloheximide blocked 15dPGJ2-induced p27 protein expression (Fig. 2 C). However, 15dPGJ2-induced p21 protein expression was blocked by cycloheximide only, despite evidence by Northern blot analysis that actinomycin did block 15dPGJ2-induced p21 mRNA (Fig. 2 D, see “Discussion”). The activation of caspases by 15dPGJ2 has been shown in a variety of cancer cell types (8Rohn T.T. Wong S.M. Cotman C.W. Cribbs D.H. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Chattopadhyay N. Singh D.P Heese O. Godbole M.M. Sinohara T. Black P.M. Brown E.M. J. Neurosci.

We show here that the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk blocked 15dPGJ2-induced apoptosis more effectively than specific caspase-3, caspase-8, or caspase-9 inhibitors DEVD-fmk, IETD-fmk, or LEHD-fmk, respectively (Fig. 3 C). These data suggest that consequent to 15dPGJ2-induced gene transcription, caspase activation is induced that cannot be completely blocked by an individual caspase inhibitor. The cyclopentenone prostaglandins possess potent antiproliferative and antitumor activities, but their mechanisms of action are complex and not well understood. Recently it was shown that 15dPGJ2induces intracellular oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma cells and hepatic myofibroblasts (38Kondo M. Oya-Ito T. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Uchida K. J. Biol.

Nakamura Y. Naito Y. Torii Y. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Ohigashi H. Satoh K. Imagawa M. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11291-11299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Additionally, Fitzpatrick and colleagues (37Mullally J.E. Moos P.J. Edes K. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30366-30373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) showed that Δ12PGJ2, the immediate precursor to 15dPGJ2, inhibits isopeptidase activity of the proteosome pathway. We have shown that 15dPGJ2 induces important and seemingly opposite biological responses, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in breast cancer cells and that these phenotypes correlate with increasing levels of PPRE-mediated transcription (1Clay C.E.

Alfred N. Fonteh A.N High K.P. Chilton F.H. J. Investig. Med. 2001; 49: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The studies presented here show that 15dPGJ2-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells requires the rapid synthesis of new gene products (<5 h after exposure) that irreversibly leads to apoptosis. Differential cDNA array analysis suggests candidate genes including p21 and p27, which are potentially critical to this process given that 15dPGJ2induces an S phase arrest. In addition to cell cycle arrest, p21 and p27 may play a critical role in apoptosis. Growth factor withdrawal leads to a proapoptotic feedback loop involving p21, p27, and caspase-3 in human endothelial cells (42Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar,43Levkau B. Scatena M. Giachelli C.M. Ross R. Raines E.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, caspase-3-mediated cleavage of p21 is an early event after DNA damage (44Gervais J.L. Seth P. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19207-19212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Moreover, dominant negative mutants of p21 abrogated apoptosis in these studies. Together these reports suggest that transcriptional activation of p21 and p27 followed by caspase-3-mediated cleavage represents a potential mechanism of action for 15dPGJ2. However, our data suggest the relationship is not so straightforward, at least for p21. Actinomycin clearly blocks 15dPGJ2-induced apoptosis but does not reduce early 15dPGJ2-induced p21 protein levels. One explanation for this may be that arachidonic acid and many of its metabolites increase protein kinase C activity (45Feng J. Han J. Pearce S.F. Silverstein R.L. Gotto Jr, A.M. Hajjar D.P. Nicholson A.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 688-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown to stabilize p21 mRNA (46Akashi M. Osawa Y. Koeffler H.P. Hachiya M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Further research is needed to reconcile these contradictory data. Recent investigations have shown that PPARγ agonists differentially regulate genes associated with cell growth and differentiation. 15dPGJ2 negatively regulates myogenesis in part by inhibition of MyoD gene expression (47Hunter J.G. van Delft M.F. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38297-38306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and DuBois and colleagues (33Gupta R.A. Brockman J.A. Sarraf P. Willson T.M.

Our data suggest that early expression of p21 and p27 may be required for 15dPGJ2-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. These studies show, however, that expression of gene products is likely agonist- and cell type-specific. Regulation of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism is critical to the growth and survival of all cell types. 15dPGJ2 inhibits transcriptional activation of COX-2 by a negative feedback loop mediated through PPARγ (26Xin X.

In addition, hexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine, a novel phospholipase A1 digestion product of alkyl phosphatidylcholines in low density lipoprotein (54Davies S.S. Pontsler A.V. Marathe G.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. Hinshaw J.C. Prestwich G.D. Hilaire A.S. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Moreover, 15-lipoxygenase-2 and the formation of (15S)-HETE from AA is decreased in prostate adenocarcinoma (56Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and addition of exogenous (15S)-HETE induces apoptosis of prostate cancer cells (57Shappell S.B. Gupta R.A. Manning S. Whitehead R. Boeglin W.E. Schneider C. Case T. Price J. Jack G.S. Wheeler T.M. Matusik R.J. Brash A.R. Dubois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 497-503PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of COX-2 by cyclopentenone prostaglandins with coordinate increases in intracellular oxidative stress could lead to the generation of oxidized AA metabolites as endogenous activators of PPARs or other transcription factors, creating a positive feedback loop of PPAR activation resulting in expression of gene products critical to apoptosis. This may account for the fact that 15dPGJ2 is a far more potent activator of PPRE-mediated transcription than any other PPARγ agonist. While many of the hypotheses presented here are being tested in our laboratory, deeper understanding of how AA metabolites induce cancer cell growth or death is essential. Common chemotherapeutic drugs including alkylating agents and nucleoside analogues work by blocking cellular replication at the level of DNA or interfere with ubiquitous cellular process such as microtubule formation. This strategy reduces cell proliferation, but relapse and the development of resistance to chemotherapy suggest that cancer cells are not eradicated. The data presented here demonstrate that gene expression may be required for the induction of apoptosis and thus eradication of some cancer cell types. In addition, potent bioactive derivatives of AA, such as cyclopentenone prostaglandins, acting through multiple pathways may represent a promising class of therapeutic molecules for the treatment of cancer. However, the potential of these compounds to act as proliferators of tumorigenesis via PPARγ (58Saez E. Tontonoz P. Nelson M.C. Alvarez J.G. Ming U.T. Baird S.M. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Nat.

The data presented here strongly suggest that new gene synthesis is required for 15dPGJ2-induced apoptosis. Whether this is mediated via PPARγ or some other critical regulator of gene synthesis remains to be defined."

Once incorporated in DNA, they act as chain terminators, due to the lack of a 3′-hydroxyl group. As for the other anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 drugs, their efficiency is limited by the emergence of resistant viral strains. Unexpectedly, previous studies indicated that resistance toward NRTIs is achieved via two distinct and generally exclusive mechanisms. Resistance mutations either decrease the efficiency of NRTIs incorporation or increase their excision from the extended primer. To understand the emergence of different resistance mechanisms toward a single inhibitor class, we compared the incorporation and the pyrophosphorolysis of several NRTIs using wild type reverse transcriptase (WT RT). We found that the efficiency of discrimination or excision by pyrophosphorolysis in the presence of nucleotides of a given NRTI is a key determinant in the emergence of one or the other resistance pathway. Indeed, our results suggest that the pathway by which RT become resistant toward a given NRTI can be predicted by studying the inhibition of WT RT, because the resistance mutations do not confer new properties to the mutant enzyme, but rather exacerbate pre-existing properties of the WT enzyme. They also help to understand the low cross-resistance toward d4T observed with the 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT or zidovudine)-resistant RT.

The virally encoded reverse transcriptase (RT1), an RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, converts the viral (+) RNA genome into a double-stranded DNA (1Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1993Google Scholar) that will integrate into the host genome. Reverse transcriptase of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, is the target for two families of therapeutic inhibitors: non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTIs) and nucleoside analogues (NRTIs). Among the group of nucleosides used in multitherapies, two compounds are analogues of thymidine, 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT or zidovudine) and 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (d4T or stavudine), two are cytidine analogues, 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (ddC or zalcitabine) and β-l-(−)-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thyacytidine (3TC or lamivudine), one is an adenosine analogue, 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine (ddI or didanosine), and one is a guanosine analogue, abacavir. Those nucleoside analogues are metabolically activated by host cellular kinases to their corresponding triphosphate forms (for review see Ref.2Guedj R. Virologie. 1999; 3: 17-28Google Scholar), which are incorporated into the DNA by HIV-1 RT. The base moiety of didanosine and abacavir are also modified during this process, generating ddATP and ddGTP, respectively (for an overview, see www.niaid.nih.gov/daids/dtpdb/fdadrug.htm). Due to the lack of a 3′-OH group on the ribose ring, NRTIs act as chain terminators by blocking further elongation of the nascent DNA, leading to inhibition of viral replication. The efficiency of a nucleoside as an inhibitor and, hence, the effectiveness of the therapy depend on (i) the cellular uptake of the compound and its activation into the triphosphate form, (ii) the incorporation of the analogue into the DNA, and (iii) the removal of the incorporated chain terminator. Prolonged use of NRTIs in clinical treatment and in cell culture of HIV-1 invariably give rise to resistant viruses bearing substitutions in the pol gene. Patients treated with AZT display a set of up to six mutations in the pol gene involving M41L/D67N/K70R/L210W/T215F or T215Y/K219Q, which confer a >100-fold AZT resistance to HIV-1. When d4T is given as the only drug to patients naive to AZT, RT bearing a V75T substitution is selected in 10% of the cases (3Coakley E.P. Gillis J.M. Hammer S.M. AIDS. 2000; 14: F9-F15Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Notably, the most important resistance mutations associated to treatment with d4T are in fact AZT-associated resistance mutations (4Lin P.F. Gonzalez C.J. Griffith B. Friedland G. Calvez V.

In principle, the resistance mutations could act either by (i) decreasing the incorporation efficiency of the triphosphate form of the NRTI or (ii) increasing the removal of the incorporated NRTI. In fact, the two latter mechanisms are now well documented. Retroviral RTs lack 3′-exonuclease proofreading activity (11Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) but are capable of pyrophosphorolysis, the reversal reaction of polymerization, releasing an unblocked, extensible DNA chain and the analogue triphosphate (12Hsieh J.C.

It has been reported that AZT resistance mutations lead to enhanced excision of AZT from the nascent DNA strand by pyrophosphorolysis (14Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G.

More recently, it was shown that the AZT-resistant enzyme can efficiently unblock AZT-terminated primers by transfer of the chain terminator to a nucleoside triphosphate, most likely ATP in vivo, in a reaction similar to pyrophosphorolysis (16Götte M. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3579-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that AZT-resistant RT binds AZTMP-terminated primers more tightly than WT RT does (21Canard B. Sarfati S.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14596-14604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, removal by ATP lysis of d4TMP from the primer terminus is more efficient with AZT-resistant enzyme as compared with WT RT but only when the concentration of the next incoming nucleotide is low (19Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Schinazi R.F. So A.G. Scott W.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Most of the resistance mutations associated with the other nucleoside analogues cluster into a different mechanism, whereby the acquisition of the mutation interferes with nucleoside incorporation into the DNA. Resistance to 3TC, due to M184V/I mutations in the RT, most likely involves steric hindrance, decreasing either binding of the analogue (22Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Wilson J.E. Aulabaugh A. Caligan B. McPherson S. Wakefield J.K. Jablonski S. Morrow C.D. Reardon J.E. Furman P.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recent structural data show that the incoming 3TCTP is able to form a close complex with the primer/template (P/T)·RT, which is however less stable than in the presence of the normal nucleotide (25Gao H.Q. Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that the 3TC-resistant enzyme has very poor pyrophosphorolysis and ATP lysis properties on 3TCMP- or AZTMP-terminated primers (16Götte M. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3579-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations K65R (26Gu Z. Arts E.J. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2760-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and L74V (27Martin J.L. Wilson J.E. Haynes R.L. Furman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6135-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) also confer resistance to RT by decreasing the incorporation efficiency of NRTIs. Finally, the molecular mechanism underlying d4T resistance has very recently been investigated, showing that the V75T mutation changes both nucleotide selectivity and repair of d4TMP-terminated DNA chains by PPi, but not ATP (28Selmi B. Boretto J. Navarro J.M. Sire J. Longhi S. Guerreiro C. Mulard L. Sarfati S. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13965-13974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), unlike the situation with the AZT-resistant enzyme. To understand the emergence of different resistance mechanisms toward a single class of inhibitors, we performed a study on AZTTP, d4TTP, ddCTP, 3TCTP, and ddATP, the metabolized products of inhibitors used in clinical treatment, using WT HIV-1 RT. We conducted a comparative study of the incorporation and the pyrophosphorolysis, in the presence or absence of the next incoming nucleotide, of these NRTIs. We found that the efficiency of NRTI discrimination or excision by pyrophosphorolysis in the presence of the next incoming nucleotide by WT RT was a key determinant in evolution toward one or the other resistance pathways. Indeed, our results suggest that the pathway by which RT will evolve to become resistant toward a given inhibitor can be predicted by studying the inhibition of WT RT by this inhibitor. In addition, comparison of our results with those published by others (6Zhang D. Caliendo A.M. Eron J.J. DeVore K.M. Kaplan J.C. Hirsch M.S. D'Aquila R.T. Antimicrob.

They also help to understand the existence of low cross-resistance toward d4T observed with the AZT-resistant RT (30Katlama C. Valantin M.A. Matheron S. Coutellier A. Calvez V. Descamps D. Longuet C.

Viral RNA encompassing nucleotides 1–311 of HIV genomic RNA (Mal isolate) was used as a template. It was synthesized by in vitro transcription and purified as previously described (31Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C. Darlix J.L. Mougel M. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We also used as a template a 38-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (DPBS20) carrying, in addition to the primer binding site (PBS) sequence, 20 nucleotides of the HIV-1 Mal sequence upstream of the PBS. Natural tRNA 3Lys, used as a primer, was purified from beef liver as previously described (32Bénas P. Bec G. Keith G. Marquet R. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Dumas P. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After dephosphorylation with calf intestine phosphatase, it was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32]ATP and phage T4 polynucleotide kinase. An 18-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN), complementary to the PBS and labeled at the 5′-end with phage T4 polynucleotide kinase, was also used as a primer. Chimerical primers, consisting of analogue-terminated ODN primers, were prepared as follows: The 5′-end-labeled ODN was hybridized to DPBS20 in 100 mm NaCl for 20 min at 70 °C prior to extension at 37 °C for 1 h with 7.5 μm RNase H(−) HIV-1 RT using the appropriate set of dNTP and chain terminator (AZTTP, d4TTP, ddTTP, 3TCTP, ddCTP, and ddATP), at 0.2 mm each, in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol, to obtain the expected analogue-terminated primer. After proteinase K treatment and phenol/chloroform extraction, the chimerical primers were ethanol-precipitated and purified on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Plasmids used for production of WT and RNase H(−) HIV-1 RT, bearing the E478Q mutation, were kindly provided by Dr. Torsten Unge (Uppsala, Sweden), together with the protocols for protein overexpression and purification. For primer/template (P/T) formation, the primers were quantitatively heat-annealed with RNA or DNA templates at a 1:2.5 ratio, as described previously (33Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25269-25272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 nmP/T (tRNA 3Lys/1–311 RNA or ODN/1–311 RNA) was preincubated at 37 °C for 4 min with 20 nmHIV-1 RT (WT or RNase H(−)) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol. Reverse transcription was initiated by addition of 50 μm of each dNTP, in the presence or absence of 5 μm chain terminator (AZTTP, d4TTP, ddTTP, 3TCTP, ddCTP, and ddATP) and 150 μm PPi. The reaction was stopped at various times ranging from 1 min to 3 h by the addition of one volume of formamide containing 50 mmEDTA, and the reaction products were analyzed on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantified with a BioImager BAS 2000 (Fuji). 10 nm analogue-terminated primer/template was preincubated at 37 °C for 4 min with 200 nm of RNase H(−) HIV-1 RT. Reactions were initiated by addition of 150 μm PPi, 50 μm of the dNTP corresponding to the analogue present at the end of the chain, and 50 μm of the next complementary ddNTP, allowing synthesis of the +1 product with respect to the analogue. Reactions were stopped at various times from 30 s to 3 h, and the products were analyzed as described above. Pyrophosphorolysis reactions were performed essentially as described above, except that the reaction was initiated by addition of 150 μmPPi to the P/T·RT complex, in the absence of nucleotides. The 5′-end-labeled, chain-terminated primer (ODN)/template (DPBS20) was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with a 25-fold excess of RNase H(−) RT and increasing concentrations of the next incoming dNTP (Fig. 2), in 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 2.5% glycerol, and 100 μl/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction mixture was further incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, after the addition of KCl (to 100 mm final concentration) and poly(rA)/oligo(dT) to 0.3A260 unit/ml. The mixture was then cooled on ice prior to analysis on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Both the gel and the migration buffer contained 45 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3) and 50 mm KCl. For all experiments, quantification of the radioactivity and curve fitting were performed with MacBAS 2.5 (Fuji) and IGOR Pro 3.1 (WaveMetrics, Inc.) softwares, respectively. A number a studies compared the relative incorporation of NRTIs and their natural counterpart. Indeed, it has been shown that wild type (WT) HIV-1 RT barely discriminated between dTTP and AZTTP (34Kerr S.G. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14064-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 35Rigourd M. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. J. Biol.

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the contrary, ddCTP was incorporated less efficiently than dCTP (22Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and incorporation of 3TCTP was even worse (22Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Krebs R. Immendorfer U. Thrall S.H. Wohrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Finally, ddATP was also shown to be a moderately efficient substrate for WT HIV-1 RT (37Ueno T. Mitsuya H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1092-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, these data were obtained using different experimental conditions and P/T complexes and can hardly be used to compare the inhibitory efficiency of these nucleotide analogues. In addition, to our knowledge, no detailed pre-steady state kinetics of the pyrophosphorolysis of NRTIs has been performed, and thus, the available data (16Götte M. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3579-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol.

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) are hardly amenable to quantitative comparison. Therefore, we undertook a comparative study of the incorporation and pyrophosphorolysis of the available NRTIs by WT HIV-1 RT, with the aim of understanding the emergence of two distinct resistance mechanisms for this class of RT inhibitors. First, we performed (−) strand strong-stop DNA synthesis experiments using as a template a viral RNA encompassing the first 311 nucleotides of the 5′-end of the HIV-1 Mal genome and as a primer either the natural tRNA 3Lys or a DNA oligodeoxyribonucleotide complementary to the PBS (ODN). Using ODN as a primer allows DNA synthesis to start immediately in the processive elongation mode (38Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 39Lanchy J.M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the absence of nucleoside analogues and PPi, when tRNA 3Lys was used as a primer (Fig. 1A,left panel), reverse transcription proceeded as previously described (38Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). During the initiation phase, i.e. the addition of the first six nucleotides to the tRNA 3Lys, the +3 and +5 products accumulated at short incubation times (1 min) but disappeared after prolonged incubation. Quantification of the gels indicated that, after 1 to 3 h of incubation, the amount of (−) strand strong-stop product represented 14% of the total radioactivity. When a 5 μm concentration of a given inhibitor was added to the reaction, making it 1/10 the dNTP concentration, the inhibition rate varied (Fig. 1, B, C,D, E, and F, left panels). Calculation of the percentage of final product in the presence of each analogue, relative to no inhibitors (TableI), allowed us to classify the nucleoside analogues according to their efficiency of inhibition: AZTTP was the most effective inhibitor, followed by ddCTP, d4TTP, ddATP, and 3TCTP. The results followed the same trend when ODN was used as a primer for reverse transcription (data not shown). Overall, these results are qualitatively in keeping with the previous studies discussed above, except for ddCTP, which was expected to be a significantly weaker inhibitor than d4T (22Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Vaccaro J.A. Parnell K.M. Terezakis S.A. Anderson K.S. Antimicrob.

The percentage of final product relative to no inhibitor was the ratio between the amount of (−) strand strong-stop DNA in the presence and absence of inhibitor. The rescue ratio was calculated as the ratio between the percentage of final product in the presence and in the absence of PPi, for a given inhibitor. Open table in a new tab The amount of (−) strand strong-stop DNA versus the total radioactivity was quantified in the absence and presence of the various NRTIs and PPi. The percentage of final product relative to no inhibitor was the ratio between the amount of (−) strand strong-stop DNA in the presence and absence of inhibitor. The rescue ratio was calculated as the ratio between the percentage of final product in the presence and in the absence of PPi, for a given inhibitor. As expected, addition of the T-analogues to the reaction induced arrest of reverse transcription where A residues were present in the template, e.g. at positions +2 and +5, or at positions 157, 155, 150, and 147 (compare Fig. 1A, left panel, to Figs. 1B and 1C, left panels). C-analogues (3TC and ddC) did not seem to be incorporated efficiently at position +1. However, they were undoubtedly incorporated at position +4 and at the other expected sites on the template (Fig. 1,D and E, left panels). The same holds true for ddATP, which was incorporated at position +6 and further along, where Ts are present in the template (Fig. 1F,left panel). Addition of physiological concentrations of PPi (150 μm) (40Barshop B.A. Adamson D.T. Vellom D.C. Rosen F. Epstein B.L. Seegmiller J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) did not significantly affect the synthesis of (−) strand strong-stop DNA in the absence of inhibitor (Fig.1A, right panel), the amount of this product representing 12% of the total radioactivity after 1 to 3 h of incubation. At short incubation times, the pauses of RT were more pronounced. However, theses pauses rapidly disappeared with increased incubation times. When PPi was added to the reaction in presence of the nucleoside analogues, synthesis of longer DNA chains, including the (−) strand strong-stop product, was partially restored, with various efficiencies depending on the inhibitors (Fig. 1, B,C, D, E, and F, right panels). The highest level of DNA repair observed was with the AZT/PPi combination. The rescue ratio, calculated as the ratio between the percentage of (−) strand strong-stop DNA in the absence and presence of PPi for a given inhibitor was 6-fold (Table I). When ODN was used as a primer, the rescue ratio was 30-fold (data not shown), in agreement with previously published results showing that repair was not occurring during the initiation step of reverse transcription (35Rigourd M. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26944-26951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, the intensity of the band at position +2, within the initiation complex, did not diminish with the addition of PPi to the reaction. Using the same type of calculation, we determined the rescue ratio for the other nucleoside analogues used in this assay (Table I), allowing us to asses their ability to be removed from the end of the primer in the presence of the four natural dNTPs as follows: AZTTP ≫ d4TTP > ddCTP = 3TCTP = ddATP. The same conclusions were drawn from experiments performed with ODN as primer (data not shown). As the incorporation efficiency during (−) strand strong-stop DNA differed among the various NRTIs, the efficiency of primer unblocking and extension in the presence of PPicould not strictly be compared in these experiments. To further address the issue of unblocking of analogue-terminated DNA chains, and to reduce the complexity of the reacti"

Physiol. 2000; 529: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Aequorin, a Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein, can be directed to a defined cellular location by adding specific targeting sequences, but single-cell imaging of aequorin bioluminescence is difficult because of the very low light output (18Chiesa A. Rapizzi E. Tosello V. Pinton P. De Virgilio M. Fogarty E. Rizzuto R. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here we combine superb selectivity of targeted aequorin, high expression induced by a viral vector (4Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J.

A. 1996; 93: 5489-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) to resolve changes of [Ca2+] in different subcellular compartments at the single-cell level. Anterior pituitary (AP) cells and lines derived from them (e.g. GH3 cells) exhibit spontaneous electric activity, Ca2+ action potentials, and oscillations of the cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c) that are responsible for basal AP hormone secretion. Hypophysiotrophic factors regulate secretion by increasing or decreasing this spontaneous activity (22Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 23Mollard P. Schlegel W. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 361-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A similar model may apply to other excitable secretory cells. Here we have monitored [Ca2+] in different subcellular compartments of living AP and GH3cells by bioluminescence imaging of targeted aequorins with the aim of defining their role in the spontaneous activity and whether this may be relevant to the physiologic function. Culture of GH3 pituitary cells and rat AP cells and imaging of [Ca2+]cwith fura-2 were as described previously (24Villalobos C. Garcia-Sancho J. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 431: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Villalobos C. Nuñez L. Garcia-Sancho J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For calculation of oscillation indexes all the differences (in absolute value) between each value and the following one were added and divided by the total number of measurements during the integration period. This parameter is sensitive to both the amplitude and the frequency of oscillations (24Villalobos C. Garcia-Sancho J. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 431: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial aequorin (mitAEQ) and low Ca2+ affinity mutated mitochondrial aequorin have been described previously (4Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytosolic aequorin cDNAs were obtained from Molecular Probes and cloned in the pHSVpUC plasmid. Packaging and titration of the pHSVnucAEQ (nuclear) and pHSVcytAEQ (cytosolic) viruses were performed as reported (19Alonso M.T. Barrero M.J. Carnicero E. Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells (3 × 103/0.5 ml) were infected with 1–3 × 103infectious virus particles of a defective herpes simplex virus, type 1 containing the corresponding aequorin gene and cultured for 12–24 h before measurements. Infection efficiency ranged between 22 and 60% (mean ± S.E., 38 ± 4%; 734 cells from 10 experiments). Cells expressing apoaequorins were incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with 1 µm coelenterazine. Coelenterazine n was used for reconstitution of low Ca2+affinity mutated mitochondrial aequorin to decrease further the Ca2+ affinity (26Alonso M.T. Barrero M.J. Michelena P. Carnicero E. Cuchillo I. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The standard incubation medium had the following composition (in mm): NaCl, 145; KCl, 5; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; glucose, 10; Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 10. Cells were placed into a perfusion chamber thermostatized to 37 °C under a Zeiss Axiovert 100 TV microscope and perfused at 5–10 ml/min with the test solutions, prewarmed at 37 °C. At the end of each experiment cells were permeabilized with 0.1 mm digitonin in 10 mmCaCl2 to release all the residual aequorin counts. Bioluminescence images (20Frawley L.S. Faught W.J. Nicholson J. Moomaw B. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Rutter G.A. Burnett P. Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Tavare J.M. Denton R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A. 1996; 93: 5489-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) were taken with a Hamamatsu VIM photon-counting camera handled with an Argus-20 image processor and integrated for 10-s periods. Photons/cells in each image were quantified using Hamamatsu Aquacosmos software. Total counts per cell ranged between 2 × 103 and 2 × 105, and noise was (mean ± S.D.) 1 ± 1 cps per typical cell area (2000 pixels). Values refer to the whole cell area. Data were first quantified as rates of photoluminescence emission/total cps remaining at each time and divided by the integration period (L/LTOTAL in s−1, where L is luminescence in cps). Emission values of less than 4 cps were not used for calculations. Calibrations in [Ca2+] were performed using the values of the constant published previously (27Alvarez J. Montero M. Petersen O.H. Measuring Calcium and Calmodulin Inside and Outside Cells. Springer, Berlin2001: 147-163Crossref Google Scholar). A transmission image was also taken at the beginning of each experiment. Oscillation indexes were calculated as described above for fura-2 but using the L/LTOTAL (s−1) values. Mitochondrial NAD(P)H fluorescence (14Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) was measured using the same set up as for aequorin with excitation at 340 ± 10 nm and emission at 450 ± 40 nm. The integration period was 6 s. For these experiments 1 mm pyruvate was added to the standard medium to keep the cytosolic NAD in the oxidized state. To investigate whether mitochondrial [Ca2+] oscillations also participate in the spontaneous activity, pituitary cells were infected with a defective herpes simplex virus vector that expresses mitochondria-targeted aequorin (4Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Photon-counting imaging of these cells (see Fig. 1A, and see Movie 1 in Supplemental Material) revealed clear cut spontaneous [Ca2+]M oscillations in 40–55% of both GH3 and AP cells (Fig. 1, B andC). Depolarization with high K+ solution evoked a larger [Ca2+]M increase in the same cells (Fig. 1 A, panel K). To explore whether [Ca2+]M oscillations could be driven by Ca2+ entry secondary to the spontaneous electric activity, we attempted suppression of electrical activity by hyperpolarizing the membrane in low K+ medium and reducing Ca2+ entry by removing external Ca2+ or blocking the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels with the dihydropyridine antagonist furnidipine. We found that all of these procedures abolished mitochondrial Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 1, B andC). Fig. 1 D summarizes the results of several experiments quantified as oscillation indexes, a parameter that is sensitive to both the amplitude and the frequency of the oscillations (see Ref. 24Villalobos C. Garcia-Sancho J. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 431: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, and see “Experimental Procedures”). Emptying of the intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin did not decrease the [Ca2+]M oscillations (Fig.1 D). Fluorescence imaging of fura-2 revealed spontaneous [Ca2+]c oscillations, which were also diminished by decreasing extracellular [K+], Ca2+removal, and furnidipine, but remained unaffected by emptying the intracellular Ca2+ stores (Fig. 1 E). The hypothalamic releasing factor TRH, which enhances the rate of action potential firing (28Winiger B.P. Schlegel W. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), increased both the [Ca2+]c and the [Ca2+]M oscillations to similar extents (see Fig. 1, C–E; the effect on [Ca2+]M is also shown in Movie 2 in Supplemental Material). Taken together, these results suggest that the [Ca2+]M oscillations are generated by the [Ca2+]c oscillations secondary to the electric activity. To investigate whether this pattern is followed by other subcellular compartments, we imaged cells expressing either the cytosolic or the nuclear aequorin. Both aequorins reported [Ca2+] oscillations that were decreased by Ca2+ removal and increased by TRH (not shown), although they were much smaller than the mitochondrial ones (Fig.1 F). This suggests the same origin for all the oscillations, but mitochondria are unique in their ability to amplify the Ca2+ signal. This organelle can take up large amounts of Ca2+ through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter at micromolar [Ca2+]c concentrations (5Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Pozzan T. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 8Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria can also accumulate efficiently Ca2+ through the so-called rapid uptake mode when exposed to trains of Ca2+ pulses at concentrations above 0.4 µm (5Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Pozzan T. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 29Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27510-27515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In living cells, the rate of uptake is extremely slow at [Ca2+]c concentrations below 2–4 µm (4Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 5Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Pozzan T. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The [Ca2+]c peaks reported by either fura-2 or cytosolic aequorin were, however, below 0.5 µm. Therefore, the large [Ca2+] oscillations found in mitochondria suggest that local domains with higher [Ca2+]c are transiently generated nearby. Aequorin burn-up by Ca2+ can be used not only to detect but also to trace the history of high [Ca2+] domains. In populations of chromaffin cells stimulated with brief (10-s) high K+ stimuli two different mitochondrial pools develop. One takes up very large amounts of Ca2+(>10−4m) whereas the other accumulates a much smaller Ca2+ load (<10−5m). Aequorin in the first pool burns out completely during the first high K+ stimulus and becomes blind to the subsequent stimuli. The different behavior of these two pools is not because of different intrinsic properties but rather because of different spatial locations relative to the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, which determines that they sense local [Ca2+]cdiffering by at least one order of magnitude (4Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Here we have explored the behavior of pituitary cells, now at the single-cell level. When cells were stimulated with repetitive high K+ pulses, nuclear aequorin reported a similar light output for each stimulus (Fig.2A), but mitochondrial aequorin responded much more strongly to the first stimulus (Fig.2 B). In the nucleus each stimulus produced a comparable aequorin consumption (2–5% in average) corresponding to nuclear [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]N) peaks of about 1 µm (Fig. 2 C). Cytosolic aequorin or fura-2 also reported reproducible [Ca2+]crises on repetitive stimulation (Fig. 2 E). In mitochondria the first stimulus consumed about 40% of the total aequorin whereas each of the following ones consumed only 1–2%, and the first calibrated Ca2+ peak was dramatically higher than the subsequent ones (Fig. 2 D). Even though there was considerable quantitative variation among cells, the qualitative behavior was similar for all the cells (see extreme examples of single-cell traces in Fig. 2, C and D). In cells permeabilized with digitonin and exposed to Ca2+ buffers all the mitochondrial aequorin pool behaved homogeneously (not shown). We interpret the above results in terms of different spatial location of the two mitochondrial pools in the intact cells. The first pool (M1), probably closer to the plasma membrane, takes up large amounts of Ca2+ that burn up all its aequorin and render it blind to subsequent stimuli. The second mitochondrial pool (M2) takes up much smaller amounts of Ca2+, and its aequorin remains sensitive to repeated stimulation. The average sizes of M1 and M2 pools were 53 and 47%, respectively. To confirm that blinding of aequorin in the M1 pool was because of complete burn-up by high [Ca2+], the experiments were repeated with a mutated, low Ca2+ affinity aequorin, reconstituted with coelenterazine n, which enables [Ca2+] measurements in the 30–1000 µmrange (4Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 26Alonso M.T. Barrero M.J.

Petersen O.H. Measuring Calcium and Calmodulin Inside and Outside Cells. Springer, Berlin2001: 147-163Crossref Google Scholar). Now each stimulus produced a light output that, once corrected for the M1 pool size, revealed repetitive [Ca2+]M peaks of about 400 µm(Fig. 2 F). At this concentration the wild type aequorin would be >90% consumed within 1 s (27Alvarez J. Montero M. Petersen O.H. Measuring Calcium and Calmodulin Inside and Outside Cells. Springer, Berlin2001: 147-163Crossref Google Scholar). As discussed in detail elsewhere (4Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), the [Ca2+] sensed by M1 and M2 pools must differ by at least one order of magnitude to explain the differences in the rates of mitochondrial uptake. Therefore, our results indicate that subcellular domains with very different [Ca2+]c are generated during depolarization of pituitary cells with high K+ and that they are sensed by different, strategically located, mitochondrial pools. A similar organization has been proposed recently in pancreatic acinar cells (7Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Because of physical constraints, the high [Ca2+]c domains must lie very close to the plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (30Neher E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Lack of detection by either fura-2 or cytosolic aequorin also suggests that the high [Ca2+]c domains occupy a very small fraction of the total cytosolic volume. Then, how could Ca2+ invade such a large fraction (53%) of the mitochondrial pool? It has been shown recently that continuity of the intramitochondrial space is much larger than thought previously (9Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar, 31Skulachev V.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 23-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Therefore Ca2+entering mitochondria near the plasma membrane could diffuse throughout the matrix to invade deeper mitochondria. On the other hand, even a random distribution of mitochondria would result in preferential location near the plasma membrane. Because of spherical shape as much as 50% of the cell volume lies within 1 µm from the plasma membrane in a 10-µm-diameter cell. Do high [Ca2+]c domains also build up in unstimulated cells? Can such domains account for the spontaneous [Ca2+]M oscillations? To answer these questions we studied the effects of blinding the M1 pool with a brief high K+ pulse on the subsequent oscillations. The high K+ pulse greatly decreased the oscillations reported by mitochondrial aequorin but not those reported by fura-2 (Fig.3, A–C). This suggests that spontaneous [Ca2+]Moscillations arise from the M1 pool. The increase of [Ca2+]M to micromolar levels activates several mitochondrial dehydrogenases (8Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases results in increased NADH levels (12Pralong W.F. Hunyady L. Varnai P. Wollheim C.B. Spat A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Pralong W.F. Spat A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27310-27314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). We find that hyperpolarization with low K+ solution, which blocks [Ca2+]M oscillations (Fig.1 C), induced a reproducible decrease of NAD(P)H fluorescence (Fig. 3 C). Removal of external Ca2+ had the same effect (not shown). These results suggest that the [Ca2+]M oscillations are regulating mitochondrial activity even in the basal state. Depolarization with high K+ (Fig. 3, D and E) or stimulation with TRH (not shown) produced a clear increase of NAD(P)H fluorescence. A picture of a highly structured spatiotemporal organization of Ca2+ signals emerges from the above results. Mitochondria contribute to shaping local Ca2+ domains (4Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 7Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemli G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), but, in turn, the Ca2+ signal tunes up local mitochondrial function. A mitochondrial subpopulation closer to the plasma membrane is able to monitor the activity of Ca2+ channels, and, by taking up Ca2+ from local high [Ca2+]c domains, to increase [Ca2+]M to levels high enough to activate mitochondrial function to match local energy needs (5Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Pozzan T. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) and perhaps to provide other factors required for the secretory process (17Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The remaining mitochondria, the bulk cytosol, and the nucleus also sense [Ca2+]c oscillations but at a smaller amplitude, perhaps adequate for regulation of other cellular functions. We thank Drs. J.

https://openalex.org/W2065900691,"Glutamine 114 of OYE1 is a well conserved residue in the active site of the Old Yellow Enzyme family. It forms hydrogen bonds to the O2 and N3 of the flavoprotein prosthetic group, FMN. Glutamine 114 was mutated to asparagine, introducing an R-group that is one methylene group shorter. The resultant enzyme was characterized to determine the effect of the mutation on the mechanistic behavior of the enzyme, and the crystal structure was solved to determine the effect of the mutation on the structure of the protein. The Q114N mutation results in little change in the protein structure, moving the amide group of residue 114 out of H-bonding distance, allowing repositioning of the FMN prosthetic group to form new interactions that replace the lost H-bonds. The mutation decreases the ability to bind ligands, as all dissociation constants for substituted phenols are larger than for the wild type enzyme. The rate constant for the reductive half-reaction with β-NADPH is slightly greater, whereas that for the oxidative half-reaction with 2-cyclohexenone is smaller than for the wild type enzyme. Oxidation with molecular oxygen is biphasic and involves formation and reaction with O⨪2, a phenomenon that is more pronounced with this mutation than with wild type enzyme. When superoxide dismutase is added to the reaction, we observe a single-phase reaction typical of the wild type enzyme. Turnover reactions using β-NADPH with 2-cyclohexenone and molecular oxygen were studied to further characterize the mutant enzyme.

Old Yellow Enzyme p-hydroxybenzaldehyde Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE)1is an NADPH oxidoreductase that contains flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as the prosthetic group. OYE was first described in brewers' bottom yeast by Warburg and Christian in 1932 (1Warburg O. Christian W. Naturwissenschaften. 1932; 20: 688Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2Warburg O. Christian W. Biochem. Z. 1933; 266: 377-411Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments established that a small organic molecule identified as FMN, which is associated with the protein in a 1:1 stoichiometry, is necessary for catalytic function (3Theorell H. Biochem. Z. 1934; 275: 344-346Google Scholar, 4Theorell H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1956; 65: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). OYE is able to oxidize NADPH and, somewhat less efficiently, NADH (5Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Abramovitz A.S. Massey V.

Oxygen can reoxidize reduced OYE, albeit at a rate that suggests it is not the physiological oxidant (5Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other oxidants include quinones, methylene blue, cytochrome c, and ferricyanide (5Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently it was found that 2-cyclohexenone (8Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a large number of other α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones are able to act as effective electron acceptors (9Vaz A.D. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). OYE catalyzes the reduction of the double bond rather than the carbonyl group, an action that is probably connected with its physiological function. Oxidized Old Yellow Enzyme binds phenolic compounds to develop complexes with long wavelength (500–800 nm) absorbance bands (6Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Matthews R.G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1779-1786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are due to charge transfer interactions in which there is significant π-orbital overlap between the phenolate anion, which acts as an electron donor, and oxidized FMN, which acts as the electron acceptor (6Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Massey V. Schopfer L.M. Dunham W.R. Bray R.C. Engel P.C. Mayhew S.G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1984: 191-210Crossref Google Scholar). Substituents on the phenolic compounds affect this binding, and a correlation between the energy of the charge-transfer band with the Hammett para function has been demonstrated (11Massey V.

Chem. 1985; 260: 13639-13647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other ligands that bind to OYE are steroids (9Vaz A.D. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 13Massey V. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1993. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1993: 371-380Google Scholar), anions such as chloride ions, and other nicotinamide dinucleotides besides NADPH (5Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Old Yellow Enzyme from brewers' bottom yeast has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (14Saito K. Thiele D.J. Davio M. Lockridge O. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20720-20724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two isozymes of OYE fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae, OYE2 and OYE3, which are 91 and 81% identical with the OYE from brewers' bottom yeast, respectively, have been cloned and characterized (8Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Niino Y.S. Chakraborty S. Brown B.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1983-1991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Based on the results of theS. cerevisiae genome sequencing project, it has been established that yeast contains only these two OYE isozymes (16Cherry J.M. Adler C. Ball C. Chervitz S.A. Dwight S.S.

Rudolf Weber, Berlin1999: 659-662Google Scholar). The family of sequence homologues of OYE, some of which are presented in Fig. 1A, has been increasing rapidly. These homologues have been demonstrated in plant, yeast, and bacterial species (20–33). It should be noted that the Gln-114 in OYE1 is conserved in all members of the family. 12-Oxophytodienoate-10,11-reductase isozymes function in the jasmonic acid synthesis pathway of plants to reduce a double bond α,β to a ketone, converting 12-oxophytodienoic acid to 3-oxo-2-(pent-2′enyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (20Biesgen C.

Morphinone reductase from Pseudomonas putida M10 catalyzes the same sort of reaction, reducing morphinone to hydromorphinone (22French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All homologues, including N-ethylmaleimide reductase, pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase, 2-cyclohexenone reductase fromPseudomonas syringae, xenobiotic reductase, and glycerol trinitrate reductase, are able to reduce the double bond of 2-cyclohexenone. The crystal structure of OYE1 has been solved for the oxidized enzyme (1OYA), the oxidized enzyme with p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (1OYB), and the reduced enzyme (1OYC) at 2 Å resolution (35Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 36Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9357-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues that influence ligand binding and catalysis have been identified. Access to the FMN cofactor is on thesi-face of the isoalloxazine, with the re-face buried in the protein (36Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9357-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The phenolic ligand,p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, is positioned parallel to thesi-face of the FMN, and the phenolate oxygen is within hydrogen-bonding distance of His-191 and Asn-194. FMN is H-bonded to Thr-37, Gln-114, and Arg-243 in the vicinity of the isoalloxazine ring, and tyrosine 196 is positioned such that it can act as an active site acid, donating a proton to the α-position of the double bond of the unsaturated substrate, coupled with hydride transfer from reduced FMN to the β-position. Solution of the crystal structure with an NADPH analogue showed that the amide oxygen of the nicotinamide ring was positioned approximately the same as the phenolate oxygen with the C-4 position of the nicotinamide ring close to N-5 of FMN, suggesting optimal positioning of NADPH for hydride transfer to the flavin (35Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,36Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9357-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). With only one accessible site, the enzyme must act by a ping-pong mechanism, consistent with the steady state kinetics of all forms of the enzyme studied (5Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Brown B.J. Deng Z. Karplus P.A. Massey V. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 3556-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The effect of mutation of active site residues of Old Yellow Enzyme has been studied. The hydroxyl of threonine 37 is within hydrogen bonding distance of O4 of FMN. Mutation of this residue to alanine resulted in an enzyme with a decreased redox potential and, concomitantly, an enhanced oxidative activity and decreased reductive activity when compared with wild type enzyme (39Xu D. Kohli R.M. Massey V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3556-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mutation of His-191 to Asn resulted in a protein that did not bind ligands or substrates well. Mutation of Asn-194 to His resulted in a protein that was unable to bind FMN tightly, and a double mutant, H191N/N194H, catalyzed reduction at a more rapid rate and showed some decrease in binding affinity for phenolic ligands (37Brown B.J. Deng Z. Karplus P.A. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Tyrosine 196 is positioned to act as an active site acid, donating a proton to the α-position of the double bond of the unsaturated substrate. Mutation of this residue to phenylalanine resulted in an enzyme that was severely inhibited in the oxidative half-reaction with 2-cyclohexenone and other α,β-unsaturated aldehydes or ketones (38Kohli R.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32763-32770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this paper we discuss the effect of mutation of glutamine 114, which hydrogen-bonds to O2 and N3 of FMN (Fig. 1B and Refs. 35Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and36Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9357-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Glutamine 114 was mutated to asparagine to study the effects of the hydrogen-bonding interactions and the role of this residue in catalysis. The effect of the mutation of glutamine 114 to asparagine is to introduce a side chain that is one methylene unit shorter than glutamine. The mutant enzyme reductive and oxidative half-reactions, binding with phenolic ligands, catalytic turnover, and crystal structure were studied to better understand the role of glutamine 114. Tryptone and yeast extract were from Difco. Competent E. coli BL21-DE (3Theorell H. Biochem. Z. 1934; 275: 344-346Google Scholar) strains and the pET-3b plasmid vector were from Novagen. Ampicillin and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 2-Cyclohexenone, β-NADPH,p-methoxyphenol, pentafluorophenol,p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-chlorophenol,p-cyanophenol, cytochrome c, catalase, superoxide dismutase were from Sigma-Aldrich. To create the point mutation, the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit by Stratagene was used. Single-stranded oligonucleotides containing the point mutation were synthesized by the Biomedical Research Core Facilities at the University of Michigan. The primers had the sequence 5′ to 3′, GTTCGTTTGGGTTAACTTATGGGTTTTGGGTTGGGCTGC, and 3′ to 5′, CAAGCAAACCCAATTGAATACCCAAAACCCAACCCGACG. Using the OYE1 gene cloned into a pET-3b plasmid, the polymerase chain reaction was conducted using a PerkinElmer GeneAmp PCR 2400 apparatus to yield the cloned, mutated plasmid. The wild type, double-stranded DNA template was removed by digestion with the restriction enzymeDpnI. The mutated plasmid was transformed into Epicurian coli XL1-Blue cells and isolated by using the QIAprep Mini-Prep kit from Qiagen. The plasmid sequence was determined by the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core confirming the success of the mutagenesis procedure. The T7 primer and three oligonucleotides spanning the entire coding region of OYE1 were used to analyze the sequence. The mutant plasmid was transformed into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. Q114N-OYE1 was isolated as described previously for wild type enzyme using a phenol affinity column (40Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on spectral data, fractions containing OYE1-Q114N with a 280/460-nm ratio of no more than 10 were combined, concentrated with a Centriprep 30 Amicon filter, and dialyzed against 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. On SDS-PAGE, the mutant enzyme ran as a single band at an equivalent position to wild type OYE1. The yield of the mutant enzyme was 325 mg of enzyme from 6 liters of culture. All spectral data were obtained using a Hewlett Packard diode array 8452A or a Cary 3 spectrophotometer. Oxidized OYE-Q114N was titrated with various phenols in 1-cm cuvettes, and the absorbance changes were recorded. Sufficient data were collected to enable calculation of the spectral changes associated with complete binding of the ligand. From the spectral data, the dissociation constants were calculated by determining the concentration of free ligand and enzyme relative to bound ligand-enzyme complex. Extinction coefficients of the charge-transfer complex were found by taking the absorbance at the long wavelength maximum at saturation. The reductive half-reaction with NADPH was studied using a Hi-Tech SF-61 stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Reactions were monitored at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Concentrations of NADPH solutions used were 50, 100, 150, and 200 μm after mixing. The concentration of the oxidized enzyme solution was such that absorbance at 460 nm was greater than 0.2. Reactions were monitored at various wavelengths using anaerobic conditions to study binding of NADPH, formation of the NADPH-oxidized flavin charge-transfer complex, and reduction of the flavin. For the oxidative half-reaction with 2-cyclohexenone, enzyme was reduced using an NADPH-generating system composed of glucose 6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and NADP+. Concentrations of 2-cyclohexenone used were 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, and 600 μm after mixing. All buffers and solutions were made anaerobic by bubbling with argon for at least 15 min before use. For the oxidative half-reaction with oxygen, enzyme was reduced with 1) an NADPH-generating system, 2) xanthine, xanthine oxidase, and benzyl viologen, or 3) titration with sodium dithionite. Oxygen solutions were prepared by bubbling 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with gases containing different oxygen percentages for at least 15 min before use. Oxygen concentrations after mixing were 0.128, 0.305, and 0.610 mm. Data analysis was conducted using Program A, developed by C. J. Chiu, R. Chung, J. Diverno, and D. P. Ballou at the University of Michigan. Turnover of OYE-Q114N by NADPH and 2-cyclohexenone was studied by using the Hi-Tech stopped-flow spectrophotometer. NADPH concentrations of 100 or 200 μm were used, whereas 2-cyclohexenone concentrations were varied between 200 μmand 2 mm. The enzyme concentration was adjusted so that absorbance at 462 nm was below 0.1. All solutions were made anaerobic before use. Reactions were monitored at pH 7.0 in phosphate buffer, 25 °C. Turnover reactions with NADPH and oxygen were studied also using the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Oxidized enzyme in air-saturated 0.05m phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 200 μm NADPH was mixed with the same buffer equilibrated with 10, 21, 50, or 100% oxygen. Reactions were monitored at 340 nm to measure initial NADPH oxidation and 462 nm to follow the status of oxidized flavin enzyme during the reaction. Analysis of the 462-nm data was carried out by the method of Gibson et al. (41Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADPH/oxygen turnover was measured in air-saturated KPi (50 mm, pH 7.0) at 25 °C in the absence and presence of cytochrome c. In separate experiments the oxidation of NADPH was measured by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, and the reduction of cytochrome c by superoxide anion was measured by an increase in absorbance at 550 nm. The concentration of NADPH was determined using an extinction coefficient of 6200m−1 cm−1 (42Horecker B.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the reduction of cytochrome c was determined using a reduced-oxidized difference extinction coefficient of 21,000m−1 cm−1 (43Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The reaction was run also in the presence of superoxide dismutase (0.01 units/ml) to eliminate the effect of O⨪2 and in the presence of catalase (0.025 mg/ml) to eliminate reoxidation of reduced cytochromec by H2O2. Crystals of the Q114N mutant and its complex withp-hydroxybenzaldehyde (PHB) were grown as described for the wild type OYE (35Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The crystals were stored in a buffer that contained 0.1 m HEPES, pH 8.3, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 40% polyethylene glycol 400. The crystals belong to the space group P43212 with unit cell parametersa = b = 142.46 Å, c = 42.93 Å for the free mutant, and a = b= 143.00 Å and c = 43.00 Å for the Q114N·PHB complex. X-ray diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode x-ray generator and a RAXIS-IV detector. The data were scaled and merged using HKL 2000 (44Otwinski Z. Mimor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). All crystallographic refinement was carried out using CNS version 0.9a (45Adams P. Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type OYE1 structure at 1.65-Å resolution (36Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9357-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was used as the starting model and used to phase the initial maps. In the free OYE1 mutant enzyme crystal structure, the Gln-114 was replaced by Asn. Amino acid residues Asn-114, Tyr-375, Phe-296, Tyr-196, Phe-250, Pro-295 and the isoalloxazine ring were moved manually to fit the density. The loop from residues 292 to 305 had very little density but was left in the model. The chloride present in the active site of wild type OYE was removed, and a water molecule was added to some weak density above the central part of the flavin. In the Q114N·PHB complex structure the initial map showed a clear difference density for PHB at its expected site of binding on thesi-face of the flavin ring.

Open table in a new tab The flavoprotein spectrum of Q114N is compared with that of OYE1 in Fig. 2. The mutation results in a 4-nm blue shift in the flavoprotein peak. On titration to saturation withp-chlorophenol, both OYE1 and the Q114N mutant enzyme display a long wavelength absorbance peak. The peak of the long wavelength absorbance of the mutant enzyme withp-chlorophenol is at a slightly higher wavelength than that of OYE1, and the extinction coefficient is somewhat lower. A total of five phenolic compounds were tested for binding with OYE1 and Q114N, and the results are summarized in TableII. Like the wild type enzyme, OYE1-Q114N forms charge-transfer complexes with the phenolates to develop strong absorbance bands in the long wavelength range. All the dissociation constants (Kd) for the mutant enzyme were higher than for the wild type enzyme. According to the crystal structure of OYE1 (35Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) the side chain of glutamine 114 hydrogen bonds to O2 and N3 of FMN in the active site (Fig. 1B). Because the mutation from glutamine to asparagine shortens the side chain by one methylene unit, binding in the active site is expected to be altered as the difference in Kd values demonstrate. In general, there were slight shifts of 5–7 nm toward longer wavelengths in the absorbance maxima of the charge transfer complexes. The extinction coefficient for binding of the substituted phenols by the Q114N mutant is lower in all cases except pentafluorophenol.Table IILigand binding comparison studies between OYE1 and Q114N Open table in a new tab The reductive half-reaction for Q114N was studied by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The reaction scheme for reduction of OYE is as follows (5Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).EFMN+NADPH⇌k2k1EFMN­NADPHMichaelis complex⇌k4k3EFMN·NADPH*Charge­Transfer complexk6⥮k5EFMNH2+NADP+⇋k8k7EFMNH2·NADP+REACTION1Binding between NADPH and the enzyme to form the Michaelis complex occurred in the 3-ms dead time in the spectrophotometer (k1 andk2); this was observed by noting the absorbance difference between the initial flavin spectrum and the starting absorbance for reactions monitored at 460 nm. Formation of the Michaelis complex was concentration-dependent as an increase in NADPH concentration corresponded to a larger decrease in initial absorbance in the 460–500-nm range. Initial binding was followed by observance of a long wavelength absorbance band of the charge-transfer complex with NADPH as the electron donor and the oxidized flavin as the acceptor (k3 andk4). Compared with thekCT (k3 +k4) of 340 s−1 found from 530-nm data for wild type enzyme, the value for the mutant enzyme was lower at around 200 s−1. Reduction of the flavin was observed to occur after the formation of the charge-transfer complex (k5 and k6). The results are summarized in Table III. Comparison with kred for wild type OYE revealed that reduction occurred slightly faster for the mutant.Table IIIComparison of reductive and oxidative half-reactions of OYE1 and Q114NOYE1 (37)Q114NReductive half-reaction KdNADPH<10−5m1.2 × 10−5 m kred5.1 ± 0.1 s−15.4 ± 0.1 s−1Oxidative half-reaction Oxygen, kox3.8 × 103 m−1s−17.4 × 102 m−1s−1 Kdcyclohexenone3.2 × 10−5 m1.2 × 10−3 m 2-Cyclohexenone, kox102 ± 4.5 s−131 ± 2 s−1 Open table in a new tab It was observed that Q114N behaved like the wild type enzyme in its concentration dependence of NADPH for charge-transfer complex formation. The mutant enzyme also shows some dependence on NADPH concentration for reduction, which is dissimilar to the wild type enzyme, where the observed rate constant for reduction is independent of NADPH concentration. This is probably due to the relative values of the rate constants k3 andk4 in the 2-step binding process of NADPH preceding reduction of the enzyme flavin. To determine the rate of oxidation of the Q114N mutant enzyme by 2-cyclohexenone, the reduced enzyme was mixed with various concentrations of cyclohexenone in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, and the reoxidation of the enzyme-bound flavin was monitored at 460 nm. The double bond between C2 and C3 of 2-cyclohexenone (ReactionFR2) is reduced by the reduced flavin to form cyclohexanone (8Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with wild type enzyme a complex between reduced enzyme and cyclohexenone is formed before the oxidation-reduction reaction, as evidenced by the saturation kinetics. With the mutant enzyme 2-cyclohexenone concentrations of 10 mm were required to approach saturation. The results are summarized in Table III and Fig.3. The rate is ∼1/3 that determined for OYE1, and 2-cyclohexenone is bound less tightly to the mutant enzyme by a factor of ∼40. Reduced OYE typically reacts with molecular oxygen to form the oxidized enzyme and hydrogen peroxide in a monophasic reaction.EFMH2+O2→koxEFMN+H2O2REACTION3The kox for wild type OYE is 3.8 × 103m−1 s−1 and appears to be a simple second-order reaction without formation of a discrete complex with oxygen preced"

In this study, we examined adenovirus type 5 (AdV) effects on IFN-γ-dependent gene expression and Janus family kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling components in human tracheobronchial epithelial cells. We found that AdV infection specifically inhibited IFN-γ-dependent gene expression in airway epithelial cells without evidence of epithelial cell injury or generation of a soluble extracellular inhibitor. Furthermore, infection with AdV for 18–24 h blocked phosphorylation/activation of the Stat1 transcription factor that regulates IFN-γ-dependent genes. Although AdV also inhibited IFN-α-dependent phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2, interleukin-4-dependent phosphorylation of the related transcription factor Stat6 was not affected, indicating that the virus selectively affected specific signaling pathways. Our results indicate that AdV inhibition of the IFN-γ signal transduction cascade occurs through loss of ligand-induced receptor complex assembly and consequent component phosphorylation and suggest that lack of complex assembly is due to decreased expression of the IFN-γR2 chain of the IFN-γ receptor. IFN-γR2 is required at an early step in Janus family kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway activation and is expressed at low levels in airway epithelial cells, supporting the concept that adenoviral down-regulation of the level of this IFN-γ receptor component allows for persistent modulation of IFN-γ-dependent gene expression.

IFN-γ is produced by T cells and natural killer cells and mediates host cell effects through a high affinity receptor linked to a specific Janus family kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling cascade (3Darnell J.E.

Activation of this cascade is initiated by engagement and multimerization of the IFN-γ-receptor by IFN-γ, phosphorylation of IFN-γR1-associated Jak1- and IFN-γR2-associated Jak2-tyrosine kinases, and then phosphorylation of the IFN-γR1 chain (5Igarashi K.

Through this pathway, Stat1 triggers an entire set of immune response genes oriented toward antiviral defense by either direct activation of gene transcription or induction of other transcription factors, such as interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1, that amplify the antiviral response (9Sims S.H.

We and others have shown that during early infection the adenoviral early region 1A (E1A) gene expresses a protein that inhibits gene expression through direct interaction with several cellular transcription factors including Stat1 and its cAMP-response-element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300 coactivator proteins (27Eckner R.

In this report, we demonstrate that wild type adenovirus type 5 (AdV) infection for 18–24 h specifically inhibits IFN-γ-dependent gene expression in airway epithelial cells through direct effects on the IFN-γ receptor complex. Experiments were performed with primary-culture human airway epithelial cells rather than transformed cell lines in order to exclude confounding effects of site of origin or oncogenes. We show that AdV blocks ligand-induced receptor complex assembly and receptor component phosphorylation and is associated with a specific decrease in expression of the IFN-γR2 chain of the IFN-γ receptor, analogous to modulation of sensitivity to IFN-γ-induced proliferation, apoptosis, and MHC class I expression in T lymphocytes (31Pernis A.

Probes for RNA blot analysis included: 1) the 1.8-kb XbaI fragment from pCD1.8 containing human ICAM-1 cDNA in pCDM8 (a gift from M. Dustin, Washington University and D. Staunton, Harvard University) (39Staunton D.E. Merluzzi V.J. Rothlein R. Barton R. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A.

Epithelial cell protein levels were assessed by immunoblot analysis using specific Abs against human JAK-STAT pathway components as described previously (6Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L.

Whole cell protein extracts were prepared by lysis of hTBE cell monolayers in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.75 mmdithiothreitol, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 μmaprotinin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid reaction method (Pierce), and equal amounts of cell protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 7–10% polyacrylamide. Resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), exposed to 5% nonfat milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 to block nonspecific antigens, and then incubated with Ab against a specific cellular protein. Primary Ab binding was detected using goat anti-mouse or sheep anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Reprobing of membranes with a different primary Ab was done after washing in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 65 °C for 30 min to remove the previous Ab. Release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by hTBE cell monolayers was determined by a spectrophotometric assay of culture media based on the initial rate of oxidation of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in the presence of sodium pyruvate (42Koh J.Y. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 20: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Intracellular ATP content of hTBE cell monolayers was determined using a bioluminescence assay of cell extracts based on the reaction between ATP, Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase, and luciferin (Sigma) (43Rieger D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was determined by immunoprecipitation of JAK-STAT pathway components from hTBE cell extracts prepared as for immunoblot analysis except that IFN-γR1 was isolated by lysis of hTBE cell monolayers in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaF, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1.5% Nonidet P-40 (6Greenlund A.C.

Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid reaction, and 0.5–1.5 mg of cell protein extracts were exposed to control Ab conjugated to agarose beads or unconjugated control Ab with the corresponding protein A- or G-conjugated-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) to preclear nonspecific interacting proteins. JAK-STAT pathway components were then precipitated using either a primary Ab conjugated to agarose beads or an unconjugated primary Ab and protein A- or G-conjugated-Sepharose beads and were detected by immunoblot analysis using Ab against phosphotyrosine or the precipitated protein. Interactions between IFN-γ receptor complex components were examined by coimmunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis of JAK-STAT pathway proteins from extracts prepared by lysis of hTBE cell monolayers in immunoblot lysis buffer adjusted to contain 250 mm NaCl and 1% digitonin without Nonidet P-40 in order to maintain protein-protein interactions (7Bach E.A.

IFN-γR1 levels on the surface of hTBE cells were determined by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry as described previously (11Look D.C. Keller B.T. Rapp S.R. Holtzman M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L79-L87PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cell monolayers were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm EDTA, and 6 × 105 cells were suspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1.5 mm sodium azide, and 10 μg/ml of mouse mAb GIR-208 against human IFN-γR1 or isotype-matched control mAb. Primary Ab binding was detected using goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) followed by analysis on a FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) equipped with a 15-mW argon-ion laser. Data was acquired and analyzed using CELLQuestTM version 3.1 software (Becton Dickinson) using 1024-channel resolution over a 4-decade log range setting. IFN-γR2 levels on the surface of hTBE cells were determined similarly using 10 μg/ml of hamster mAb 2HUB-159 against human IFN-γR2 or species-matched control mAb. To increase sensitivity, primary Ab binding was detected using goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG conjugated to biotin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) followed by streptavidin conjugated to phycoerythrin (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA), and nonviable cells were detected and excluded from analysis using 7-aminoactinomycin D (Sigma). Enzyme-linked immunoassays and cytotoxicity assays were performed 2–4 times to assure reproducible results and were analyzed for statistical significance using a one-way analysis of variance for a factorial experimental design. The multicomparison significance level for the one-way analysis of variance was 0.05. If significance was achieved by one-way analysis, post-analysis of variance comparison of means was performed using Scheffe F-tests (46Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1984Google Scholar). We have previously found that ICAM-1 levels on airway epithelial cells are particularly sensitive to induction by IFN-γ, and expression of E1A by AdV inhibits ICAM-1 and other IFN-γ-dependent gene expression by direct interaction of E1A with Stat1 and its CBP and p300 coactivator proteins (11Look D.C. Keller B.T. Rapp S.R. Holtzman M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L79-L87PubMed Google Scholar, 28Look D.C. Roswit W.T. Frick A.G. Gris-Alevy Y. Dickhaus D.M. Walter M.J. Holtzman M.J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We also found that infection with AdV for 24 h resulted in loss of IFN-γ-driven gene transcription and Stat1 activation, providing another potential mechanism for global inhibition of IFN-γ-dependent gene expression (28Look D.C. Roswit W.T. Frick A.G. Gris-Alevy Y. Dickhaus D.M. Walter M.J. Holtzman M.J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of IFN-γ-dependent gene expression was maintained after 12–24 h of infection, when expression of E1A and other early adenoviral genes was decreasing (28Look D.C. Roswit W.T. Frick A.G. Gris-Alevy Y. Dickhaus D.M. Walter M.J. Holtzman M.J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we examined ICAM-1 expression on epithelial cells later in the course of adenoviral infection. Initial experiments indicated that AdV infection for 24 h had little effect on basal levels of ICAM-1 on hTBE cells, but inhibited IFN-γ-induced ICAM-1 surface protein expression (Fig. 1 A). Infect"

In ethics committee-approved projects, researchers may use deliberately fertilized ova or, with parents' consent, fertilized ova left over from therapeutic programs. In vitro culture of human embryos is permitted only up to the implantation stage. Conditions are also set for experiments on interspecies fertilization and on freezing of embryos. Concern over physician and public reception of these guidelines has been expressed by the British Medical Association."
