https://openalex.org/W2956728914,"Perceptual experiences may arise from neuronal activity patterns in mammalian neocortex. We probed mouse neocortex during visual discrimination using a red-shifted channelrhodopsin (ChRmine, discovered through structure-guided genome mining) alongside multiplexed multiphoton-holography (MultiSLM), achieving control of individually specified neurons spanning large cortical volumes with millisecond precision. Stimulating a critical number of stimulus-orientation-selective neurons drove widespread recruitment of functionally related neurons, a process enhanced by (but not requiring) orientation-discrimination task learning. Optogenetic targeting of orientation-selective ensembles elicited correct behavioral discrimination. Cortical layer-specific dynamics were apparent, as emergent neuronal activity asymmetrically propagated from layer 2/3 to layer 5, and smaller layer 5 ensembles were as effective as larger layer 2/3 ensembles in eliciting orientation discrimination behavior. Population dynamics emerging after optogenetic stimulation both correctly predicted behavior and resembled natural internal representations of visual stimuli at cellular resolution over volumes of cortex."

A signaling pathway in eukaryotes known as cGAS–STING recognizes the presence of cytosolic DNA, which alerts the immune system to viral infection or cellular damage. However, the majority of DNA viruses direct their genomic DNA into nuclei, suggesting that nuclear-specific sensing is also needed. L. Wang et al. find that during herpes simplex virus–1 infection, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 forms a complex with viral DNA, homodimerizes, and is demethylated. These events result in translocation of the complex to the cytosol and activation of the immune system through type I interferon signaling. Additionally, the complex promotes N 6 -methyladenosine modification and translocation of cGAS–STING–related mRNAs after DNA virus infection, further amplifying the immune response.

For example, there remain fundamental open questions on the phase diagram of the Hubbard model, which describes strongly correlated electrons in solids. In this work we realize the Hubbard Hamiltonian and search for specific patterns within the individual images of many realizations of strongly correlated ultracold fermions in an optical lattice. Upon doping a cold-atom antiferromagnet we find consistency with geometric strings, entities that may explain the relationship between hole motion and spin order, in both pattern-based and conventional observables. Our results demonstrate the potential for pattern recognition to provide key insights into cold-atom quantum many-body systems."
https://openalex.org/W2958077316,"A “sUPR” target for pain management? The unfolded protein response (UPR) is initiated when unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. One highly conserved arm of the UPR, the IRE1α–XBP1 signaling pathway, also plays a role in various other UPR-independent processes, including hypoxia, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Chopra et al. report that this pathway additionally regulates the production of two molecules, cyclooxygenase 2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1, that help mediate inflammation-induced pain (see the Perspective by Avril and Chevet). When elements of the IRE1α–XBP1 signaling pathway were knocked out, pain behaviors were reduced in two different mouse models of pain.

https://openalex.org/W2961203725,"Non-vesicular lipid transport between bilayers at membrane contact sites plays important physiological roles. Mechanistic insight into the action of lipid-transport proteins localized at these sites requires determination of the distance between bilayers at which this transport can occur. Here we developed DNA-origami nanostructures to organize size-defined liposomes at precise distances and used them to study lipid transfer by the synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial lipid-binding protein (SMP) domain of extended synaptotagmin 1 (E-Syt1). Pairs of DNA-ring-templated donor and acceptor liposomes were docked through DNA pillars, which determined their distance. The SMP domain was anchored to donor liposomes via an unstructured linker, and lipid transfer was assessed via a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay. We show that lipid transfer can occur over distances that exceed the length of an SMP dimer, which is compatible with the shuttle model of lipid transport. The DNA nanostructures developed here can also be adapted to study other processes occurring where two membranes are closely apposed to each other."

https://openalex.org/W2956696658,"Protein-protein interactions between E3 ubiquitin ligases and protein termini help shape the proteome. These interactions are sensitive to proteolysis, which alters the ensemble of cellular N and C termini. Here we describe a mechanism wherein caspase activity reveals latent C termini that are then recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. Using expanded knowledge of CHIP's binding specificity, we predicted hundreds of putative interactions arising from caspase activity. Subsequent validation experiments confirmed that CHIP binds the latent C termini at tauD421 and caspase-6D179. CHIP binding to tauD421, but not tauFL, promoted its ubiquitination, while binding to caspase-6D179 mediated ubiquitin-independent inhibition. Given that caspase activity generates tauD421 in Alzheimer's disease (AD), these results suggested a concise model for CHIP regulation of tau homeostasis. Indeed, we find that loss of CHIP expression in AD coincides with the accumulation of tauD421 and caspase-6D179. These results illustrate an unanticipated link between caspases and protein homeostasis."

It has been intentionally introduced in many countries as a biological control agent, whereas it has been unintentionally released in many others. Climatic factors are important in limiting the spread of H. axyridis. For example, very few records are known from tropical or desert regions. Currently, no published reports are known from Central America. Here, we report H. axyridis from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Puerto Rico. Specimens were either observed by the authors, discovered in dried insect collections, or retrieved from searching through online photographs available from the citizen science project iNaturalist and the photo-sharing website Flickr. These new records and the wide distribution of H. axyridis in Latin America suggest several invasion events, which have gone unnoticed until now. We stress the need for further, large-scale monitoring and show the advantage of citizen science to assess the presence of invasive alien species."

Paradoxically, this teamwork has produced a field focused nearly exclusively on mapping the brain as if it evolved in isolation. Here, we discuss promises and challenges in advancing our understanding of how human minds connect during social interaction. As scientists, we brainstorm and develop experimental designs with our colleagues and students. Paradoxically, this teamwork has produced a field focused nearly exclusively on mapping the brain as if it evolved in isolation. Here, we discuss promises and challenges in advancing our understanding of how human minds connect during social interaction. The scientific study of the brain has increased dramatically over the last century, spawning dozens of subfields from cellular to cognitive neuroscience. Modern neuroscience can be credited with incalculably important discoveries across scales from electrophysiological mechanisms to large-scale anatomical and functional architecture. Yet, despite this immense acquisition of knowledge, we still know very little about how human brains work in their most ubiquitous and biologically meaningful context: social interaction. Social interaction is woven into the fabric of daily life. From birth, we learn from caregivers and, later, from teachers and peers. Long after developmental milestones have been reached, interaction continues to be the medium through which we generate and share ideas, align attitudes and beliefs, tune emotions, and experience the world. As scientists, we brainstorm and develop experimental designs with our colleagues and students. Paradoxically, this teamwork has produced a field focused near exclusively on mapping the brain as if it evolved in isolation. If the brain had evolved to operate in isolation, we would be better equipped for living alone. However, from survivor spouses to solitary confinement, unwanted social isolation is one of the strongest predictors of mental instability, poor physical health, and suicide. Social interaction appears to afford the inter- and intra-brain processes that keep us sane. The field’s historical focus on the individual brain is understandable. Serious methodological constraints have limited multi-brain, interactive paradigms. Scalp electrodes sensitive to weak electrical signals are swamped by movements of facial musculature, fMRI requires individual subjects lie supine in a noisy tube, and fNIRS, MEG, and other technologies each have trade-offs that make a robust interpersonal neuroscience challenging. But recent technological and analytical innovations are increasingly optimizing these tools for social contexts, and new tools are coming. Making headway on how brains interact is becoming increasingly tractable. One of the most influential discoveries to open up interpersonal neuroscience is that similar mental processing across brains is revealed in synchronous inter-brain activity. From shared sensory responses to shared social interpretations, greater inter-brain synchrony indexes similar mental states (see Hasson and Frith, 2016Hasson U. Frith C.D. Mirroring and beyond: coupled dynamics as a generalized framework for modelling social interactions.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2016; 371: 20150366Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, for a review) and the degree of this synchronicity has real-world implications including friendship, learning, and mental health (see Redcay and Schilbach, 2019Redcay E. Schilbach L. Using second-person neuroscience to elucidate the mechanisms of social interaction.Nature Reviews Neuroscience. 2019; Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, for a review). Synchrony, including more complex higher-order correlations, will continue to be a fruitful index of mental alignment. Separate from brain-to-brain synchrony are approaches that embed brains in live communicative settings, in which human participants are able to directly interact with each other. The rationale behind multi-person interactive settings is that people adapt their communication to their beliefs about a conversational partner (Kuhlen et al., 2017Kuhlen A.K. Bogler C. Brennan S.E. Haynes J.D. Brains in dialogue: decoding neural preparation of speaking to a conversational partner.Soc. Cogn. Affect. Neurosci. 2017; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Through the experimental manipulation of those beliefs, these types of settings have potential to shed light on elusive social conduct disorders as when prefrontal lesion patients do not tailor their interactions to their communication partners (Stolk et al., 2015Stolk A. D’Imperio D. di Pellegrino G. Toni I. Altered communicative decisions following ventromedial prefrontal lesions.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 1469-1474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, a large gap remains in our understanding of how human minds connect during social interaction. Although studies of similar mental processing and partner-adapted processing are informative in their own ways, we are still lacking neurocognitive theories of how humans co-create and share information. Beyond the above methodological constraints, the field has struggled to gain experimental access to the idiosyncratic and fleeting shared mental constructs that emerge from everyday dialog. For instance, a great deal of effort has been spent in understanding how human brains process social stimuli, implicitly assuming those stimuli contain stationary meanings. Yet, few studies have investigated how two or more people manage to converge on a shared meaning. As becomes clear below, this deceptively subtle difference is of fundamental importance if we want to understand how human minds meet during social interaction and create mutual understanding of intrinsically ambiguous social stimuli in the face of their ever-changing thoughts. Human communication is at the heart of our social world and provides an exemplary testing ground for understanding the principles and mechanism of social interaction. Historically, cognitive neuroscience has approached human communication by focusing on how linguistic material and body gestures are encoded and decoded by individuals according to the features and structural dependencies of those communicative signals. Yet, human communication is not a sequence of monologues built on context-invariant signals. Daily conversation is built on turn-taking over ambiguous words and behaviors that can only be resolved by individuals who infer their context of use in an ongoing interaction. Using controlled experimental settings that allow pairs of individuals to coordinate and align their mental states on a trial-by-trial basis, a new line of research is investigating how people generate, negotiate, and converge on the meaning of their communicative behaviors. This research is focused on characterizing core interpersonal processes supporting the development and coordination of novel shared representations. One notable discovery using this approach is that brains become synchronized due to the accumulation of shared representations at a scale independent from the communicative behaviors themselves (Stolk et al., 2014Stolk A. Noordzij M.L. Verhagen L. Volman I. Schoffelen J.M. Oostenveld R. Hagoort P. Toni I. Cerebral coherence between communicators marks the emergence of meaning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 18183-18188Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This interpersonal coupling was driven by periods in which communicators needed to mutually adjust their understanding based on signals from their partners. Conversely, this coupling was reduced when communicators used stereotyped signals that both parties already understood. Observations like these suggest that the meaning of a communicative behavior is not a property of the signal, nor of individual minds interpreting that signal. Rather, communicators engage in a practice of continuous mutual adjustment to keep their thoughts aligned with one another, forming a shared cognitive space that provides the context for selecting and interpreting communicative behaviors that can be mutually and rapidly understood, even at their first occurrence (Stolk et al., 2016Stolk A. Verhagen L. Toni I. Conceptual alignment: How brains achieve mutual understanding.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2016; 20: 180-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A recent study causally tested the notion of a shared cognitive space underlying human communication in pairs of individuals on the autism spectrum (Wadge et al., 2019Wadge H. Brewer R. Bird G. Toni I. Stolk A. Communicative misalignment in Autism Spectrum Disorder.Cortex. 2019; 115: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Despite otherwise indistinguishable performance from neurotypical pairs, pairs of individuals with autism had lower communicative success. This communicative impairment was not simply a consequence of reduced cognitive flexibility or social motivation, as individuals with autism showed a similar propensity to change their communicative behaviors following a misunderstanding with their communication partner. They even spontaneously placed emphasis on communicatively relevant portions of their behavior for the benefit of their partner, as neurotypical partners would do. Crucially, however, individuals with autism struggled to rapidly converge on a shared conceptualization of their communicative behaviors with their communication partners. This communicative misalignment predicted communicative impairment across all pairs and was greatest when the conceptualizations depended on the unique communicative context established through past interaction with their partners. These findings illustrate how the meaning of a communicative signal is best understood within the conceptual frame of reference that people in dialog develop together. As epitomized by the largely segregated interaction spaces between individuals with autism (Figure 1, cf. proportion of single-color clusters in the pairwise interaction trajectories), neurotypical human minds navigate and constrain the vast space of meaning by continuously considering and aligning to recent signals from their partner. As discussed below, moment-to-moment neural measures of shared representations might provide a window into how shared cognitive spaces are mechanistically instantiated and updated, and how they determine the meaning of a signal. Any new methodology brought to bear on social interaction should not extinguish the phenomenon for the sake of experimental control. Good science needs to be as simple as possible, but not simpler. We need to study human interaction under simplifying conditions without ignoring that the natural context of the phenomenon is multimodal, interactive, and cognitively opaque. Characterizing the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting human interaction will require experimental approaches that respect that context. Multimodality raises the largely ignored problem of how an individual decides to distribute a communicative goal across different behavioral channels (e.g., speech, hand gestures, facial movements, prosody, body posture), and how those multimodal behaviors are rapidly integrated by another individual given the timing constraints of turn-taking during human dialog. Interactivity raises the problem of how an individual decides to engage in communicative repairs, like when to interrupt a signaling behavior to ask for clarification, how much clarification to ask for, and how to signal what has not been understood without adding further ambiguities. Cognitive opacity means that human interaction is driven by mental states, but those mental states are not unambiguously defined by the behaviors we use as referents. There is no explicit feedback or physical pointer to the “correct” mental referent, and communicators need to rapidly solve a complex inferential problem (Frank and Goodman, 2012Frank M.C. Goodman N.D. Predicting pragmatic reasoning in language games.Science. 2012; 336: 998Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This fact differentiates human communicative interactions from competitive interactions, where game-theoretic optima can be analytically derived from a space of possibilities, or local minima could be found across a solution landscape based on supervised learning, as currently implemented in deep learning approaches. Given that human interaction depends on the context of interaction, and given that communicators continuously modify that context, it will be important to capture behavioral and neuronal responses on a trial-by-trial basis, in order to track the trial-contingent context in which those responses occur. A first step toward this goal is to describe brain-to-brain interactions in terms of information flow, that is, to quantify the effects that interacting partners have on each other beyond synchrony. Information flow is routinely studied as directed functional connectivity within single brains and might be extended to capture nonlinear neural dynamics of mutual adaptation on the dyad or group level. Another possibility is to use tools from dynamical systems theory, representational similarity analysis, or topic modeling to isolate relevant configurations in neuronal and behavioral state-space. Abstraction techniques like these might be able to capture brain-to-brain and trial-to-trial dependencies in a way similar to the interaction spaces of Figure 1 and prove fruitful for connecting shared representational geometries in brain data to behavior. How minds interact is not one question but an umbrella of questions at the heart of what drives us to connect. Such open questions include: why is social interaction protective for mental health? Do coupled brains reduce free energy by creating and leveraging shared mental models? What role does dialogue, the ecological niche of language, play in creating these across-brain patterns? Why do people find it easier to “click” with some people more than others? And to what extent are across-brain patterns observed in other social species? As with any emerging field, the interpretation of novel brain-to-brain patterns requires great care. Validating the role that the different lawful relationships between and across brains play in social interactions depends on our ability to link them with behavioral outcomes as well as on our ability to generate careful theoretical scaffolding for potential mechanisms. As with any multifaceted question, the question of how minds interact can be posed in multiple ways and at multiple scales. Though superficially a question of social behavior, the resulting insights will touch all domains influenced by interactive contexts from attention to learning and memory, and perception to executive function. This question is too large to be partitioned to a subfield and will undoubtedly require a vertically integrated, interdisciplinary effort of psychologists, neuroscientists, physicists, engineers, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, and sociologists. We have learned a great deal from careful, rigorous research on the single brain. But we do not live in isolation. Our thoughts and behaviors are communicated and negotiated in concert with other minds. And much as spiders use their webs to think (Japyassú and Laland, 2017Japyassú H.F. Laland K.N. Extended spider cognition.Anim. Cogn. 2017; 20: 375-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the social webs in which we are embedded dynamically shape and are shaped by our mental models and experiences. Our health demands this socially organized neural regulation (Smith and Christakis, 2008Smith K.P. Christakis N.A. Social Networks and Health..Annual Review of Sociology. 2008; 34: 405-429Crossref Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), and this need is likely true for all social species. Indeed, we already know that social animals housed in solitary cages have substantially worse health outcomes than those co-housed. By looking in only one head at a time, our knowledge about how the human brain works has been necessarily limited. By incorporating the kind of multimodal, dynamic, and collective contexts the brain evolved to solve, the field will be better positioned to achieve a deep understanding of the human mind.

https://openalex.org/W2962347623,"Excreted small-molecule signals can bias developmental trajectories and physiology in diverse animal species. However, the chemical identity of these signals remains largely obscure. Here we report identification of an unusual N-acylated glutamine derivative, nacq#1, that accelerates reproductive development and shortens lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Produced predominantly by C. elegans males, nacq#1 hastens onset of sexual maturity in hermaphrodites by promoting exit from the larval dauer diapause and by accelerating late larval development. Even at picomolar concentrations, nacq#1 shortens hermaphrodite lifespan, suggesting a trade-off between reproductive investment and longevity. Acceleration of development by nacq#1 requires chemosensation and is dependent on three homologs of vertebrate steroid hormone receptors. Unlike ascaroside pheromones, which are restricted to nematodes, fatty acylated amino acid derivatives similar to nacq#1 have been reported from humans and invertebrates, suggesting that related compounds may serve signaling functions throughout metazoa. Male C. elegans excrete an N-acylated glutamine that acts via evolutionarily conserved nuclear hormone receptor and chemosensory pathways to counteract dauer diapause and accelerate sexual maturation of hermaphrodites, at the cost of shortening hermaphrodite lifespan."

Although they appear prominently in quantum field theory to regularize divergent physical quantities, their influence on experimental observables is difficult to discern. Here, we discovered a striking manifestation of a quantum anomaly in the momentum-space dynamics of a 2D Fermi superfluid of ultracold atoms. We measured the position and pair momentum distribution of the superfluid during a breathing mode cycle for different interaction strengths across the BEC-BCS crossover. Whereas the system exhibits self-similar evolution in the weakly interacting BEC and BCS limits, we found a violation in the strongly interacting regime. The signature of scale-invariance breaking is enhanced in the first-order coherence function. In particular, the power-law exponents that characterize long-range phase correlations in the system are modified due to this effect, indicating that the quantum anomaly has a significant influence on the critical properties of 2D superfluids."

Hepatocyte-specific knockout of the NAD+-synthesizing enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) reduces liver NAD+ levels, but the metabolic phenotype of Nampt-deficient hepatocytes in mice is unknown. Here, we assessed Nampt’s role in maintaining mitochondrial and metabolic functions in the mouse liver. Using the Cre-LoxP system, we generated hepatocyte-specific Nampt knockout (HNKO) mice, having a 50% reduction of liver NAD+ levels. We screened the HNKO mice for signs of metabolic dysfunction following 60% HFD feeding for 20 weeks ± NR supplementation and found that NR increases hepatic NAD+ levels without affecting fat mass or glucose tolerance in HNKO or WT animals. High-resolution respirometry revealed that NR supplementation of the HNKO mice did not increase state III respiration, which was observed in WT mice following NR supplementation. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption and fatty-acid oxidation were unaltered in primary HNKO hepatocytes. Mitochondria isolated from whole-HNKO livers had only a 20% reduction in NAD+, suggesting that the mitochondrial NAD+ pool is less affected by HNKO than the whole-tissue pool. When stimulated with tryptophan in the presence of [15N]glutamine, HNKO hepatocytes had a higher [15N]NAD+ enrichment than WT hepatocytes, indicating that HNKO mice compensate through de novo NAD+ synthesis.

In mitochondria, NAD+ is central for ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation, where NADH serves as an electron donor (18.DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Mitochondrial respiratory-chain diseases.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348 (12826641): 2656-266810.1056/NEJMra022567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). NAD+ is also used as a precursor for the synthesis of NADP+, which is an important cofactor for biosynthesis and antioxidative defenses (19.Agledal L. Niere M. Ziegler M. The phosphate makes a difference: cellular functions of NADP.Redox Rep. 2010; 15 (20196923): 2-1010.1179/174329210X12650506623122Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, beneficial effects of NAD+ precursor supplementation may be mediated by increased activity of NAD+-dependent sirtuins (20.Bonkowski M.S. Sinclair D.A. Slowing ageing by design: the rise of NAD+ and sirtuin-activating compounds.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17 (27552971): 679-69010.1038/nrm.2016.93Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Sirtuins (SIRT1–7) comprise a family of deacylase enzymes, several of which regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function (21.Giblin W. Skinner M.E. Lombard D.B. Sirtuins: guardians of mammalian health span.Trends Genet. 2014; 30 (24877878): 271-28610.1016/j.tig.2014.04.007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Sirtuins break down NAD+ to nicotinamide (NAM) and O-acetyl ADP-ribose. As NAM inhibits sirtuin activity, the NAD+ generated from recycled NAM is important for maintaining sirtuin activity (22.Avalos J.L. Bever K.M. Wolberger C. Mechanism of sirtuin inhibition by nicotinamide: altering the NAD+ cosubstrate specificity of a Sir2 enzyme.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17 (15780941): 855-86810.1016/j.molcel.2005.02.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). NAM and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate are turned into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) (23.Cantó C. Menzies K.J. Auwerx J. NAD(+) Metabolism and the control of energy homeostasis: a balancing act between mitochondria and the nucleus.Cell Metab. 2015; 22 (26118927): 31-5310.1016/j.cmet.2015.05.023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs) further convert NMN to NAD+ using ATP as a substrate. Supplementation with NMN reduces the adverse effects of obesity, diabetes, and aging in rodents (9.Uddin G.M. Youngson N.A. Sinclair D.A. Morris M.J. Head to head comparison of short-term treatment with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and 6 weeks of exercise in obese female mice.Front.

In the liver, NAD+ can also be generated de novo from tryptophan or from nicotinic acid (NA) through the Preiss-Handler pathway (25.Preiss J. Handler P. Biosynthesis of diphosphopyridine nucleotide: I. Identification of intermediates.J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233 (13563526): 488-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of NAD+ from tryptophan is a multistep process requiring eight separate reactions (26.Bender D.A. Biochemistry of tryptophan in health and disease.Mol. Aspects Med. 1983; 6 (6371429): 101-19710.1016/0098-2997(83)90005-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Synthesis from NA begins with the conversion of NA to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) by the action of NA phosphoribosyltransferase (27.J P Handler P. Biosynthesis of diphosphopyridine nucleotide. II. Enzymatic aspects.J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233 (13563527): 493-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NAMN is then further converted to NA adenine dinucleotide and finally to NAD+ by the action of NMNAT and NAD synthase, respectively (27.J P Handler P. Biosynthesis of diphosphopyridine nucleotide. II. Enzymatic aspects.J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233 (13563527): 493-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These final two steps are also required for NAD+ synthesis from tryptophan (26.Bender D.A. Biochemistry of tryptophan in health and disease.Mol. Aspects Med. 1983; 6 (6371429): 101-19710.1016/0098-2997(83)90005-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As Nadsyn1 expression is restricted to liver, kidney, and small intestine, NAD+ synthesis from NA and tryptophan is limited to these tissues (28.Mori V. Amici A. Mazzola F. Di Stefano M. Conforti L. Magni G. Ruggieri S. Raffaelli N. Orsomando G.

Additionally, NAD+ can be synthesized from nicotinamide riboside (NR), which is converted to NMN by the nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRK) (29.Ratajczak J. Joffraud M. Trammell S.A. Ras R. Canela N.

It is not known whether decreased liver NAD+ content observed in rodent models for NAFLD is due to increased activity of NAD+-consuming enzymes or is due to decreased NAD+ biosynthesis. Furthermore, it is not known whether low NAD+ levels are a consequence of hepatic lipid accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction or whether low NAD+ levels precede steatosis development. The NAMPT inhibitor FK866 aggravates the development of steatosis in high-fat diet–fed mice (36.Wang L.-F. Wang X.-N. Huang C.-C. Hu L. Xiao Y.-F. Guan X.-H. Qian Y.-S. Deng K.-Y. Xin H.-B.

https://openalex.org/W2960544790,"Highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) fruit accumulate high levels of anthocyanins during ripening, which might be controlled by abscisic acid (ABA), a signal molecule in non-climacteric fruits. For an integrated view of the ripening process from ABA to anthocyanin biosynthesis, we analyzed the transcriptomes of 'Bluecrop' highbush blueberry fruit using RNA-Seq at three ripening stages, categorized based on fruit skin coloration: pale green at ca. 30 days after full bloom (DAFB), reddish purple at ca. 40 DAFB, and dark purple at ca. 50 DAFB. Mapping the trimmed reads against the reference sequences yielded 25,766 transcripts. Of these, 143 transcripts were annotated to encode five ABA biosynthesis enzymes, four ABA signal transduction regulators, four ABA-responsive transcription factors, and 12 anthocyanin biosynthesis enzymes. The analysis of differentially expressed genes between the ripening stages revealed that 11 transcripts, including those encoding nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, SQUAMOSA-class MADS box transcription factor, and flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase, were significantly up-regulated throughout the entire ripening stages. In fruit treated with 1 g L-1 ABA, at least nine transcripts of these 11 transcripts as well as one transcript encoding flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase were up-regulated, presumably promoting anthocyanin accumulation and fruit skin coloration. These results will provide fundamental information demonstrating that ABA biosynthesis and signal transduction, and anthocyanin biosynthesis are closely associated with anthocyanin accumulation and skin coloration in highbush blueberry fruit during ripening."

Prions are composed of PrPSc, a misfolded version of the cellular prion protein (PrPC). During disease progression, PrPSc replicates by interacting with PrPC and inducing its conversion to PrPSc. As PrPSc accumulates, cellular stress mechanisms are activated to maintain cellular proteostasis, including increased protein chaperone levels. However, the exact roles of several of these chaperones remain unclear. Here, using various methodologies to monitor prion replication (i.e. protein misfolding cyclic amplification and cellular and animal infectivity bioassays), we studied the potential role of the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in prion replication in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicated that pharmacological induction of the heat shock response in cells chronically infected with prions significantly decreased PrPSc accumulation. We also found that HSP70 alters prion replication in vitro. More importantly, prion infection of mice lacking the genes encoding stress-induced HSP70 exhibited accelerated prion disease progression compared with WT mice. In parallel with HSP70 being known to respond to endogenous and exogenous stressors such as heat, infection, toxicants, and ischemia, our results indicate that HSP70 may also play an important role in suppressing or delaying prion disease progression, opening opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

To examine the trend in influenza A virus of swine (IAV-S), an active surveillance program has been conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Guangdong, China. The phylogenetic analyses showed that the external genes of the isolates were assigned to the Eurasian avian-like swine (EA) H1N1 and/or human-like H3N2 lineages with multiple substitutions, indicating a notable genetic shift. Moreover, the internal genes derived from different origins (PB2, PB1, PA, NP: pdm/09 (pandemic influenza virus 2009)-origin, M: pdm/09- or EA-origin, NS: North American Triple Reassortant (TR)-origin have become the dominant backbone of IAV-S in southern China.

Here we report the results of a hydroxyl radical footprinting analysis of the zinc-selective channel ZIPB from the Gram-negative bacterium, Bordetella bronchiseptica. Irradiating ZIPB by microsecond X-ray pulses activated water molecules to form covalent hydroxyl radical adducts at nearby residues, which were identified by bottom-up proteomics to detect residues that interact either with zinc or water in response to zinc binding. We found a series of residues exhibiting reciprocal changes in water accessibility attributed to alternating zinc and water binding. Mapping these residues to the previously reported crystal structure of ZIPB, we identified a water-reactive pathway that superimposed on a zinc translocation pathway consisting of two binuclear metal centers and an interim zinc-binding site. The cotranslocation of zinc and water suggested that pore-lining residues undergo a mode switch between zinc coordination and water binding to confer zinc mobility. The unprecedented details of water-mediated zinc transport identified here highlight an essential role of solvated waters in driving zinc coordination dynamics and transmembrane crossing.

https://openalex.org/W2963939396,"Objectives The main objective of this study was to explore the associations of family relationships and negative life events with depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents. Methods A cross-sectional study of 3081 middle school students was conducted in Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province, China. Students were asked to complete questionnaires regarding family relationships, negative life events, and depressive symptoms. A mediation analysis was carried out using a multiple regression analysis and the PROCESS macro method. Results Of all participants, 19.9% reported experiencing depressive symptoms. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 13.0% and 29.2% in participants with good and poor parental relationships, and the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 11.4% and 30.9% in participants with closed and alienated parental-child relationships, respectively. Parental relationships, parental-child relationships, and negative life events were positively correlated with depressive symptoms. The effect of parental relationships on depressive symptoms was fully mediated by negative life events (Effect = 0.052, 95% CI = [0.023, 0.082]), while the effect of parent-child relationships on adolescent depressive symptoms was partially mediated by negative life events (Effect = 0.075, 95% CI = [0.048, 0.104]). Conclusions Our results showed a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents. Poor family relationships may have the potential to increase the risk of depressive symptoms, and they could affect depressive symptoms through negative life events."

The structure of the complex identified a novel mode for chaperone–protease interactions in which the protease surrounds the chaperone. The CpaAB organization was akin to zymogen inactivation, with CpaB serving as a prodomain that inhibits catalytically active CpaA. CpaB contains a C-terminal tail that appears to block access to the CpaA catalytic site, and functional experiments with truncated variants indicated that this tail is dispensable for CpaA expression and secretion.

This is reminiscent of the Burkholderia glumae type II substrate, LipA, which requires a membrane bound, lipase-specific foldase (Lif), to be folded into its active form and secreted (11.Rosenau F.

Therefore, CpaB and Lif belong to a unique class of T2SS, membrane-bound chaperones, which possess evident functional analogies. Their role in T2SS is reminiscent of the type III secretion system (T3SS), where the chaperones are soluble cytoplasmic proteins that aid in folding, stabilization, and/or regulating secretion of T3SS substrates (12.Page A.L.

However, CpaB and Lif chaperones do not present any sequence similarity and are different in size and pI. CpaB is the first reported membrane-bound, periplasmic chaperone required for secretion of a protease via a T2SS. CpaA and CpaB interact strongly and the C-terminal periplasmic domain of CpaB is sufficient for its chaperone function and interaction with CpaA, whereas the transmembrane domain of CpaB keeps it tethered to the inner membrane preventing its secretion with CpaA (8.Kinsella R.L.

Although the necessity of CpaB for secretion of CpaA has been established, whether its role in secretion of CpaA goes beyond stabilizing CpaA has not been determined. One possibility is that this interaction inactivates CpaA preventing self-intoxication of the cell by the proteolytic activity of CpaA. However, CpaB binding appears not to block the proteolytic activity of CpaA against human factor V (8.Kinsella R.L. Lopez J. Palmer L.D. Salinas N.D. Skaar E.P. Tolia N.H. Feldman M.F.

The lack of structural information for the CpaAB complex, as well as for each of the proteins alone, hinders the development of strategies to treat antibiotic-resistant infections through the inhibition of CpaA.

Here, we present the crystal structure of the complex of CpaA from A. nosocomialis M2 with the entire periplasmic domain of its membrane-bound chaperone CpaB at 2.6-Å resolution. These studies reveal novel insight into chaperone–substrate interaction, proteolytic regulation, and substrate-specificity of an important T2SS substrate and chaperone.

We determined the crystal structure of metallopeptidase CpaA in complex with the C-terminal periplasmic domain of its chaperone CpaB by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method using crystals of selenomethionine-incorporated protein to 2.6-Å resolution (Fig. 1, Fig. S1, and Table 1). The protein constructs and residue numbering used in this study compared with reference sequences of the proteins in Acinetobacter are shown on Fig. S2. The electron density maps are clearly interpretable for the majority of the complex and the density explicitly defined the main and side chain atoms (Fig. S3). There are six copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit. Each copy is composed of one CpaA bound to one CpaB establishing the stoichiometry of the complex as 1:1. Due to specific arrangement of chaperone-protease assembly where the protease surrounds the chaperone (Fig. 1), interactions between CpaA and CpaB are prevalently intradimer contacts. This leads to an average buried surface area of 2099.7 Å2 between CpaA and CpaB. The next largest buried surface area is 560 Å2 that occurs between two CpaA molecules. The large buried surface area of ∼2099.7 Å2 suggests the dimer of CpaA and CpaB observed in the crystal structure is likely to occur in solution. The structure reveals a modular architecture of CpaA that contains four very similar predominantly β-sheet repeats (domains 1 to 4), and a fifth domain with peptidase activity (catalytic domain) (Fig. 1).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionSpace groupP1Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)110.747, 118.489, 129.583α, β, γ (°)108.94, 103.97, 100.10Resolution (Å)aValues in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.50.0–2.60 (2.64–2.60)Rpim4.0 (58.8)I/σI16.7 (1.26)CC(1/2)0.99 (0.515)Completeness, (%)96.8 (96.0)Redundancy3.5 (3.5)No. of reflections173,168RefinementRwork/RfreebRfree = free R factor based on random 5% of all data.

Open table in a new tab To unambiguously establish the solution state and solution structure of CpaAB we performed a SAXS analysis. SAXS profiles for CpaAB matched the crystal structure of the 1:1 complex very well with a χ2 value of 1.02 (Fig. 2). The ab initio envelope reconstruction from the SAXS profile resulted in an envelope that closely resembles the 1:1 CpaAB crystal structure. These results demonstrate the crystal structure of the CpaAB complex is representative of the solution state of CpaAB, and that CpaA wraps around CpaB upon interaction in solution. Each molecule of CpaB is embedded into the core of a CpaA molecule through multiple interactions (Fig. 1). The only other type II secretion chaperone:substrate complex studied of Lif/LipA suggested a model in which the chaperone wraps around the substrate and protects the cargo. In contrast, the CpaAB complex reveals entirely different arrangement of chaperone–protease interaction. Each CpaB chaperone is surrounded by the CpaA protease (Fig. 3). This novel finding extends the understanding of chaperone–substrate interplay. The metalloprotease catalytic module immediately follows repeat 4 and spans residues 372–574 (Figure 1, Figure 4A, and Fig. S2). This domain of CpaA resembles several features of the canonical metzincin superfamily of metallopeptidases including a characteristic α+β-fold, extended zinc-binding motif HEXXHXXGXXH, and a conserved Met-turn (15.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Catalytic domain architecture of metzincin metalloproteases.J. Biol.

The three histidine residues (His498, His502, and His508) are responsible for binding the catalytic zinc ion, the glutamate residue (Glu499) is the general base/acid residue involved in catalysis, whereas the Met-turn (Met527) assists in the folding and provides stability to the catalytic domain (Fig. 4A and Fig. S2) (17.Holm L. Rosenstrom P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 (20457744): 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar). To confirm these canonical metalloprotease features, we generated a Glu499 to Ala point mutation and tested CpaA activity in vitro. Mutation of CpaA Glu499 to Ala produced a catalytically inactive protease incapable of degrading Factor V (Fig. 5).Figure 5CpaA Asp499 is required for activity. Human Factor V (FV) was incubated with purified CpaA-His and CpaAE499A. Due to post-translational modification heterogeneity, FV migrates in a SDS-PAGE gel as a smear (in green). Full-length FV (high molecular weight smear) is detectable in the buffer control and when incubated with CpaAE499A, indicating that CpaAE499A is catalytically inactive.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Another important structural feature observed is a stretch of glycines (CpaA Gly466, Gly468, Gly469, and Gly471) (Fig. 4B). In other metzincin superfamily members, this conserved glycine stretch likely confers plasticity to the active site cleft and facilitates recognition of the O-glycan–induced conformation (16.Yu A.C. Worrall L.J. Strynadka N.C. Structural insight into the bacterial mucinase StcE essential to adhesion and immune evasion during enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection.Structure. 2012; 20 (22483117): 707-71710.1016/j.str.2012.02.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Finally, the peptidase domain also shows high structural similarity to adamalysins/ADAMs. The four tandem repeats of CpaA span residues 2–94 (repeat 1), 95–190 (repeat 2), 191–284 (repeat 3), and 285–371 (repeat 4). Pairwise superposition of repeats confirms they all share a similar fold (Fig. 4C and Table S1). Structural similarity search using the DALI server (17.Holm L. Rosenstrom P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 (20457744): 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3053) Google Scholar) revealed that these four repeats resemble glycan-binding domains. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, zinc metalloprotease StcE (PDB ID 4DNY) (Fig. 4D) specifically targets densely O-glycosylated substrates (16.Yu A.C. Worrall L.J. Strynadka N.C. Structural insight into the bacterial mucinase StcE essential to adhesion and immune evasion during enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection.Structure. 2012; 20 (22483117): 707-71710.1016/j.str.2012.02.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and shows structural similarity with all four repeats (Fig. 4, E–H): Dali Z-score: 10.6, r.m.s. deviation 2.2 Å for repeat 1; Dali Z-score: 8.4, r.m.s. deviation 2.7 Å for repeat 2; Dali Z-score: 10.4, r.m.s. deviation 1.9 Å for repeat 3; Dali Z-score: 8.3, r.m.s. deviation 1.9 Å for repeat 4). The four repeats form a large cavity with a buried surface area of 2,119 Å2 taken up by CpaB in the complex. This large cavity may accommodate substrates during proteolysis. Each CpaB molecule contacts all four repeats potentially blocking access for binding of glycoprotein substrates. The structure showed a large cavity in the center of CpaA formed by the contribution from all subdomains of CpaA including the four tandem repeats and a peptidase domain. This cavity comprises the active site located in the peptidase domain and a large concave surface toward the catalytic site that may serve for substrate recognition. However, the identity, recognition, and mode of interaction of CpaA proteolytic substrates remain unknown. Pairwise comparison of the six molecules of CpaA in the asymmetric unit showed negligible r.m.s. deviations ranging from 0.155 to 0.371 Å. A majority of the differences are in loops of the protease domain, whereas the glycan-binding repeats remain unchanged. The structure and organization of CpaA provide insight into potential substrate specificity. Structural superposition of CpaA with metzincin superfamily members revealed several unique structural elements that are typical for cleavage of densely O-glycosylated substrates. StcE is a ∼100 kDa metalloprotease that specifically interacts with O-glycosylated substrates (18.Lathem W.W. Grys T.E. Witowski S.E. Torres A.G. Kaper J.B. Tarr P.I. Welch R.A. StcE, a metalloprotease secreted by Escherichia coli O157:H7, specifically cleaves C1 esterase inhibitor.Mol.

The StcE INS glycan-binding domain contains a cluster of conserved solvent-exposed residues, Trp189, Arg191, and Tyr214 (Fig. 4B), suitable for binding glycoproteins (16.Yu A.C. Worrall L.J. Strynadka N.C. Structural insight into the bacterial mucinase StcE essential to adhesion and immune evasion during enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection.Structure. 2012; 20 (22483117): 707-71710.1016/j.str.2012.02.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Pairwise superposition of the INS domain with each of the four CpaA tandem repeats shows that all four repeats retain the solvent-exposed loop containing a conserved tryptophan residue at the same position, whereas the two other residues of the triad are not conserved (Fig. 4, D–G). Curiously, only residue Lys34 of the triad analogs in repeat 1 is involved in chaperone binding (Fig. 4D) and the corresponding loop is tilted toward the substrate-binding cleft, whereas the analogous loops in all other repeats are exposed to the solvent (Fig. 4A). Metallopeptidase chaperone CpaB has no significant sequence similarity to any known protein. However, it shows high structural similarity with the prodomain of Bacteroides fragilis toxin (PDB ID 3p24, Dali score 5.8, r.m.s. deviation 2.8 Å), a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase (20.Goulas T. Arolas J.L. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Structure, function and latency regulation of a bacterial enterotoxin potentially derived from a mammalian adamalysin/ADAM xenolog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (21233422): 1856-186110.1073/pnas.1012173108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CpaB consists of a large twisted antiparallel β-sheet (strands β1 and β3–β8), which vertically traverses the whole domain (Fig. 6A, Fig. S4). Strand β3 is twisted and split between the vertical antiparallel β-sheet and a small two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (strands β2 and β3) plus an adjacent antiparallel helix, α1. The helix is inserted coplanar to the small sheet between strands β1 and β2. This sheet is orthogonal to the large β-sheet and both give rise to a β-sandwich structure. The strands of the large β-sheet except the β1 are linked by simple vertical connectivity from β3 to β8. After strand β8, the polypeptide chain folds in short helix α2 and then adopts an extended coil conformation (chaperone tail) that was found inserted in the CpaA active site and carries an Asp residue that coordinates catalytic zinc together with the His triad from CpaA (Figure 1, Figure 6, B–D). In the CpaAB complex, the chaperone CpaB makes an extended network of polar interactions with the protease domain of CpaA (Table S2). The chaperone CpaB β-sheet strands β4–β7 (residues Asp110, Arg113, Thr131, Asp136, Gln142, Asp149, Gln153, and Lys155) interacts with CpaA helix 2 (residues Ser392, Leu393, Arg397, Glu400, and Asp531). In addition, the CpaB tail embeds in the catalytic active site of CpaA creating contacts between Gly167, Thr169, Asp170, and Glu172 of the CpaB tail and Cys470, Ser492, and catalytic zinc coordination partners His498, His502, and His508 of CpaA (Fig. 6B). The interaction between protease CpaA and chaperone CpaB in CpaAB complex resembles interactions between the catalytic domain (CD) and the prodomain (PD) of fragilysin-3 (PDB ID 3p24) (Fig. 6, D and E) (20.Goulas T. Arolas J.L. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Structure, function and latency regulation of a bacterial enterotoxin potentially derived from a mammalian adamalysin/ADAM xenolog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (21233422): 1856-186110.1073/pnas.1012173108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The catalytic fragilysin-3 moiety is unique within the metzincin metallopeptidases as it shows high structural similarity despite negligible sequence identity to adamalysins/ADAMs (20.Goulas T. Arolas J.L. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Structure, function and latency regulation of a bacterial enterotoxin potentially derived from a mammalian adamalysin/ADAM xenolog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The PD in fragilysin-3 is thought to confer latency maintenance for the protein and serves as a chaperone that assists in the folding and stabilization of the fragilysin-3 catalytic domain. In the fragilysin-3 structure, the PD does not cap the CD but is attached to a lateral surface (Fig. 6E). The PD prevents access to the active-site cleft through the C-terminal segment, which runs in an extended conformation across the entire CD active site in the opposite orientation that substrates occupy. As in other prodomains, the PD of fragilysin-3 prevents access of substrates to active-site clefts of zymogens. In addition to structural similarity between CpaB and the PD of fragilysin-3, superposition of CpaA peptidase domain/CpaB with fragilysin-3 reveals a similar organization of the domains and functional elements (Fig. 6, D and E). The CD of fragilysin-3 like CpaA also contains an extended zinc-binding motif and a conserved methionine within a tight 1,4-β-turn, the Met-turn (15.Gomis-Rüth F.X.

https://openalex.org/W2964169377,"Metformin, a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has recently been recognized for its pleotropic anti-proliferative, anti-cancer, and anti-aging effects. Contrary to the studies characterizing metformin effects in prostate cancer, little is known about these effects in BPH progression. With the Sample Cohort DB data during 2007 and 2017 from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) in South Korea, we investigated the preventative effect of metformin on BPH progression. The study population consisted of 211,648 BPH naïve patients that were diagnosed with BPH in 2009 and a follow-up occurrence of prostatectomy until 2017 that was defined as progression of BPH. These patients were divided into three treatment groups: without T2DM, T2DM without metformin, and T2DM with metformin. The hazard ratio in the T2DM with metformin group was 0.86 for prostatectomy compared to the group without T2DM (CI = 0.77-0.96, P value = 0.007) after adjusting for confounding factors such as age, comorbidity, residential area, level of hospital, and category of BPH medications. The T2DM with high-dose metformin group had a significantly lower risk of prostatectomy with hazard ratio of 0.76 (CI = 0.62-0.92, P value = 0.005) in stratified analysis. Our results suggest that metformin may improve BPH progression based on the reduced risk of prostatectomy, although T2DM effects on BPH were unclear. Future observational studies and prospective trials are needed to confirm the effects of metformin on BPH progression."
https://openalex.org/W2956619742,"Soil moisture is one of the most important factors affecting soil biota. In arid and semi-arid ecosystems, soil mesofauna is adapted to temporary drought events, but, until now, we have had a limited understanding of the impacts of the different magnitudes and frequencies of drought predicted to occur according to future climate change scenarios. The present study focuses on how springtails and mites respond to simulated repeated drought events of different magnitudes in a field experiment in a Hungarian semi-arid sand steppe. Changes in soil arthropod activities were monitored with soil trapping over two years in a sandy soil. In the first year (2014), we applied an extreme drought pretreatment, and in the consecutive year, we applied less devastating treatments (severe drought, moderate drought, water addition) to these sites. In the first year, the extreme drought pretreatment tended to have a negative effect (either significantly or not significantly) on the capture of all Collembola groups, whereas all mite groups increased in activity density. However, in the consecutive year, between the extreme drought and control treatments, we only detected differences in soil microbial biomass. In the cases of severe drought, moderate drought and water addition, we did not find considerable changes across the microarthropods, except in the case of epedaphic Collembola. In the cases of the water addition and drought treatments, the duration and timing of the manipulation seemed to be more important for soil mesofauna than their severity (i.e., the level of soil moisture decrease). We suggest that in these extreme habitats, soil mesofauna are able to survive extreme conditions, and their populations recover rapidly, but they may not be able to cope with very long drought periods."
https://openalex.org/W2958033175,"Background The Pint of Science festival is the biggest annual international science festival. In May 2017, we coordinated the first Pint of Science festival in Thailand and reported our initial reflections. Building on this work, we set out to evaluate more systematically events conducted in 2018. Methods In 2018, we conducted Pint of Science events at four different locations in Bangkok. Overall, there were 18 talks held over six event-days in 2018. We administered 180 self-reported questionnaires as well as conducted 11 semi-structured interviews and a focus group discussion with audience members and speakers. Results Of the 180 questionnaires handed out, 125 attendees completed the questionnaire. The majority of attendees came because they were interested in science (68.0%), to learn something new (46.4%) and to enjoy themselves (44.8%). Our qualitative results confirm the quantitative findings. In addition, speakers viewed that they benefited by improving their communication skills and having the opportunity to network with scientists and non-scientists. Speakers also mentioned that such events were a good means to engage with the public, can improve the visibility of their work and potentially attract more funding. To improve the Pint of Science activities, audience members suggested to include a more diverse range of topics, more collaborations with other local research institutions and to hold the event at larger venues. Conclusions We conclude that Pint of Science was well received in Bangkok with recommendations to improve minor issues related to practicalities and logistics."

HPIV infections do not confer complete protective immunity so reinfections occur throughout life. Since no effective vaccine is available for the two virus subtypes, comprehensive understanding of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 genetic and epidemic features is important for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 infections. Relatively few whole genome sequences are available for both HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 viruses, so our study sought to provide whole genome sequences from multiple countries to further the understanding of the global diversity of HPIV at a whole-genome level. We collected HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 samples and isolates from Argentina, Australia, France, Mexico, South Africa, Switzerland, and USA from the years 2003–2011 and sequenced the genomes of 40 HPIV-1 and 75 HPIV-3 viruses with Sanger and next-generation sequencing with the Ion Torrent, Illumina, and 454 platforms. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HPIV-1 genome is evolving at an estimated rate of 4.97 × 10−4 mutations/site/year (95% highest posterior density 4.55 × 10−4 to 5.38 × 10−4) and the HPIV-3 genome is evolving at a similar rate (3.59 × 10−4 mutations/site/year, 95% highest posterior density 3.26 × 10−4 to 3.94 × 10−4). There were multiple genetically distinct lineages of both HPIV-1 and 3 circulating on a global scale. Further surveillance and whole-genome sequencing are greatly needed to better understand the spatial dynamics of these important respiratory viruses in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2956263984,"Background To evaluate the impact of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) on clinical features in patients with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) and to compare the features of MAS in KFD with those of adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods The medical records of febrile patients hospitalised with KFD between November 2005 and April 2017 were reviewed. Patients fulfilling the 2016 classification criteria for MAS were classified as having MAS. Clinical and laboratory features of patients with KFD with and without MAS were evaluated. Poor hospitalisation outcomes were defined as intensive care unit admission or in-hospital mortality. The treatment outcomes of MAS in KFD, AOSD, and SLE were also compared. Results Among 78 patients hospitalised with KFD, 24 (30.8%) patients had MAS during admission. Patients with KFD and MAS more frequently required glucocorticoid treatment (66.7% vs 40.7%, p = 0.036) and had longer hospital stays than patients with KFD without MAS (12.5 vs 8.5 days, p<0.001). In addition, patients with MAS had worse hospitalisation outcomes than patients without MAS (29.2% vs. 0.0%, p<0.001). Among patients with MAS in KFD, AOSD, and SLE, the number of patients requiring glucocorticoid treatment after 3 months was significantly lower among patients with MAS and KFD (KFD 33.3%, AOSD 88.9%, SLE 100%, p<0.001). Conclusions The presence of MAS in KFD was associated with adverse clinical outcomes including higher steroid usage and worse hospitalisation outcomes. However, compared to those with AOSD and SLE, patients with MAS and KFD were less likely to require long-term glucocorticoid treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2963503978,"Objective Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common and associated with a marked increased risk of developing epilepsy. Animal studies indicate that treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may increase the risk of epilepsy after TBI. The aim of this study was to investigate whether use of SSRIs modifies the risk of epilepsy after TBI. Methods This was a cohort study of 205,715 persons, who suffered a TBI in Denmark from 1996 to 2013. For each person with TBI, we matched 10 reference persons (N = 2,057,150) who were alive on the day of TBI and who had the same age and gender but had no history of TBI. We used a stratified Cox regression to calculate the relative risk of epilepsy after TBI for persons exposed to TBI, SSRI or both after adjustment for income, civil status, medical and neurological comorbidities, severe mental disease, and substance abuse. Results The risk of epilepsy was 5.61 times higher for persons who used SSRI at time of TBI (adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR): 5.61 (95% CI: 4.88; 6.45)), 3.23 times higher for persons who had a TBI but did not use SSRI at time of TBI (aHR: 3.23 (95% CI: 3.12;3.35)), and 1.31 times higher for persons who used SSRI but had no TBI (aHR: 1.31 (95% CI: 1.18; 1.45)) compared to persons unexposed to both TBI and SSRI. Conclusions This large population based cohort study showed that people using SSRI at the time of a TBI had higher risk of developing epilepsy compared to people not using SSRI at the time of TBI. The results are in line with those of animal studies and calls for further studies to evaluate whether the association is due to SSRIs or to the underlying disease (e.g. depression or anxiety)."
https://openalex.org/W2963701626,"The Mag1 and Tpa1 proteins from budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) have both been reported to repair alkylation damage in DNA. Mag1 initiates the base excision repair pathway by removing alkylated bases from DNA, and Tpa1 has been proposed to directly repair alkylated bases as does the prototypical oxidative dealkylase AlkB from Escherichia coli. However, we found that in vivo repair of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-induced alkylation damage in DNA involves Mag1 but not Tpa1. We observed that yeast strains without tpa1 are no more sensitive to MMS than WT yeast, whereas mag1-deficient yeast are ∼500-fold more sensitive to MMS. We therefore investigated the substrate specificity of Mag1 and found that it excises alkylated bases that are known AlkB substrates. In contrast, purified recombinant Tpa1 did not repair these alkylated DNA substrates, but it did exhibit the prolyl hydroxylase activity that has also been ascribed to it. A comparison of several of the kinetic parameters of Mag1 and its E. coli homolog AlkA revealed that Mag1 catalyzes base excision from known AlkB substrates with greater efficiency than does AlkA, consistent with an expanded role of yeast Mag1 in repair of alkylation damage. Our results challenge the proposal that Tpa1 directly functions in DNA repair and suggest that Mag1-initiated base excision repair compensates for the absence of oxidative dealkylation of alkylated nucleobases in budding yeast. This expanded role of Mag1, as compared with alkylation repair glycosylases in other organisms, could explain the extreme sensitivity of Mag1-deficient S. cerevisiae toward alkylation damage.

DNA bases can be damaged by alkylation, which may cause mutations that lead to cell death or disease. Several examples of alkylated bases that arise in DNA from endogenous and exogenous sources are shown in Fig. 1A. Pathways for repair of alkylated bases in many organisms, including Escherichia coli and humans, include base excision repair (BER) 4The abbreviations used are: BERbase excision repairDRRdirect reversal repairϵA1,N6-ethenoadenine1mAN1-methyladenine3mAN3-methyladenineϵC3,N4-ethenocytosine7mGN7-methylguanine3mCN3-methylcytosineMMSmethyl methanesulfonate2OG2-oxoglutarateTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphinesssingle-strandeddsdouble-strandedMUGmismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylaseYPDyeast extract/peptone/dextroseAAGalkyladenine DNA glycosylase. and direct reversal repair (DRR). For example, repair of the alkylated base 1,N6-ethenoadenine (ϵA) in E. coli can be initiated by the DNA glycosylase AlkA and completed by other enzymes in the BER pathway, or DRR can be catalyzed by the DNA dealkylase AlkB in a reaction requiring ferrous iron, oxygen, and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) (Fig. 1B). Other alkylated bases are typically repaired by either BER or DRR. Interestingly, it has been suggested that some bacteria and archaea that appear to lack an AlkB-family oxidative dealkylase instead use BER with an expanded substrate repertoire to repair alkylation damage (1Leiros I.

In support of this idea, DNA glycosylases from these organisms have been shown to excise alkylated bases that have more commonly been thought to be substrates for direct repair by AlkB and related DNA dealkylases. base excision repair direct reversal repair 1,N6-ethenoadenine N1-methyladenine N3-methyladenine 3,N4-ethenocytosine N7-methylguanine N3-methylcytosine methyl methanesulfonate 2-oxoglutarate tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine single-stranded double-stranded mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase yeast extract/peptone/dextrose alkyladenine DNA glycosylase. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important organism for the study of DNA repair, yet the distribution of its alkylation repair between BER and DRR is undefined. Mag1, a DNA glycosylase that is a known homolog of E. coli AlkA, is present in S. cerevisiae (4Chen J. Derfler B. Samson L. Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase has homology to the AlkA glycosylase of E. coli and is induced in response to DNA alkylation damage.EMBO J. 1990; 9 (2265620): 4569-457510.1002/j.1460-2075.1990.tb07910.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Berdal K.G.

Both Mag1 and AlkA remove a variety of alkylated bases from DNA, and the resultant abasic DNA is then processed by downstream enzymes of the BER pathway. Mag1 is the only DNA glycosylase in S. cerevisiae that is known to excise alkylated bases. S. cerevisiae also expresses Tpa1, which, like E. coli AlkB and many other proteins, is a member of the Fe(II)- and 2OG-dependent dioxygenase superfamily (6Aravind L. Koonin E.V. The DNA-repair protein AlkB, EGL-9, and leprecan define new families of 2-oxoglutarate- and iron-dependent dioxygenases.Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (RESEARCH, 11276424): 000710.1186/gb-2001-2-3-research0007Crossref Google Scholar). Tpa1 has recently been reported to be a functional homolog of AlkB, acting as an oxidative dealkylase to repair alkylated DNA (7Shivange G. Kodipelli N. Monisha M. Anindya R.

However, Tpa1 is more closely related to Fe(II)/2OG-dependent dioxygenases that catalyze post-translational hydroxylation of proteins (8Kim H.S. Kim H.L. Kim K.H. Kim D.J. Lee S.J. Yoon J.Y.

We thus set out to clarify the roles of Mag1 and Tpa1 in the repair of alkylation damage to DNA in S. cerevisiae. The alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) is widely used to generate DNA damage to investigate DNA repair pathways. MMS methylates DNA primarily at the N-7 position of G (7mG), the N-3 and N-1 positions of A (3mA and 1mA), and the N-3 position of C (3mC) (13Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens. Plenum Press, New York1983: 45-96Crossref Google Scholar). We constructed yeast strains lacking mag1, tpa1, or both genes using standard methods. These strains were exposed to MMS to compare the contributions of Mag1 (the yeast homolog of E. coli AlkA) and Tpa1 (a possible functional homolog of E. coli AlkB) to the repair of alkylation damage. The results reveal that the mag1Δ strain is ∼500-fold more sensitive to 0.3% MMS after 1-h exposure than is WT (Fig. 2), as has been observed previously (14Chen J. Derfler B. Maskati A. Samson L. Cloning a eukaryotic DNA glycosylase repair gene by the suppression of a DNA repair defect in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86 (2682633): 7961-796510.1073/pnas.86.20.7961Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the established ability of Mag1 to remove alkylated bases, including 7mG and 3mA, from DNA (15Wyatt M.D. Allan J.M. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T.E. Samson L.D. 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylases: structure, function, and biological importance.BioEssays. 1999; 21 (10440863): 668-67610.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199908)21:8<668::AID-BIES6]mt]3.0.CO;2-DCrossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, the tpa1Δ strain and WT are similarly sensitive to MMS, and the mag1Δ tpa1Δ double-deletion strain is no more sensitive to MMS than is the mag1Δ deletion strain alone (Fig. 2). Our results with mag1Δ, but not with tpa1Δ, agree qualitatively with previous observations in E. coli where both the alkA and alkB genes were initially discovered in screens for mutants with increased sensitivity to MMS (16Yamamoto Y. Katsuki M. Sekiguchi M. Otsuji N. Escherichia coli gene that controls sensitivity to alkylating agents.J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135 (353028): 144-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kataoka H.

In addition, the MMS sensitivity of an alkAΔ alkBΔ double-deletion strain was approximately at the level predicted from the additive sensitivity of each of the single mutants (18Volkert M.R. Hajec L.I. Molecular analysis of the aidD6::Mu d1 (bla lac) fusion mutation of Escherichia coli K12.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229 (1921981): 319-32310.1007/BF00272173Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, our results validate the importance of Mag1, but not Tpa1, for repair of DNA alkylation damage in S. cerevisiae. No members of the Fe(II)/2OG-dependent dioxygenase superfamily other than Tpa1 have been identified as possible AlkB family oxidative dealkylases in S. cerevisiae (19Fedeles B.I. Singh V.

This raises the question of how lesions typically repaired by the DRR protein AlkB in E. coli, such as 1mA and 3mC, are repaired in yeast. We considered the possibility that yeast, like some bacteria and archaea, utilize DNA glycosylases to remove alkylated bases that are more commonly considered to be substrates for DRR by AlkB and related DNA dealkylases (1Leiros I.

Single-turnover kinetic measurements ([Mag1] > [substrate]) for each substrate showed that Mag1 has much higher kmax values for excision of 3mC, ϵC, and ϵA than for excision of 1mA (Figs. 3 and S1). Furthermore, although kmax values for excision of 3mC, ϵC, and ϵA are very similar (0.010–0.014 min−1; Fig. 3C and Table 1), we were only able to measure an upper limit for K1/2 for 3mC, suggesting that it binds to Mag1 very tightly and is a preferred substrate. We were also only able to measure an upper limit for K1/2 for 1mA, suggesting that it, like 3mC, binds to Mag1 tightly, despite its comparatively low kmax value of 0.00026 min−1 (Table 1). Excision of these alkylated bases by Mag1 did not occur when they were present in 25mer ssDNA oligonucleotides (Fig. S2).Table 1Kinetic parameters for excision of alkylated bases from dsDNA by Mag1 and AlkAMag1AlkARelative Mag1/AlkAϵA-25mer kmax (min−1)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).0.014 ± 0.0010.0058 ± 0.00012.4 K1/2 (nm)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).120 ± 30780 ± 400.15 kmax/K1/2 (m−1 min−1)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).120,000 ± 30,0007,400 ± 40016 Relative kcat/KmbFrom competition experiments with ϵA-19mer at 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).0.98 ± 0.131.3 ± 0.43mC-25mer kmax (min−1)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).0.013 ± 0.0010.0023 ± 0.00015.7 K1/2 (nm)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).<10cThe single-turnover rate constants for base excision from 3mC-25mer or 1mA-25mer were independent of Mag1 concentration at 50 nm Mag1, the lowest concentration used in our reactions, and we estimate that we would have been able to detect a dependence for K1/2 of 10 nm or higher (Fig. 3C).540 ± 10<0.02 kmax/K1/2 (m−1 min−1)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).>1,300,0004,300 ± 200>300 Relative kcat/KmbFrom competition experiments with ϵA-19mer at 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).>60dSee Fig. S3B for calculation of limit.0.79 ± 0.18ϵC-25mer kmax (min−1)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).0.010 ± 0.001No reaction K1/2 (nm)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).48 ± 18No reaction kmax/K1/2 (m−1 min−1)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).210,000 ± 80,000<12eSee Fig. S6D for calculation of limit.>18,000 Relative kcat/KmbFrom competition experiments with ϵA-19mer at 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).2.3 ± 0.5<0.1fSee Fig. S7D for calculation of limit.1mA-25mer kmax (min−1)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).0.00026 ± 0.000030.0012 ± 0.00010.22 K1/2 (nm)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).<10cThe single-turnover rate constants for base excision from 3mC-25mer or 1mA-25mer were independent of Mag1 concentration at 50 nm Mag1, the lowest concentration used in our reactions, and we estimate that we would have been able to detect a dependence for K1/2 of 10 nm or higher (Fig. 3C).3,400 ± 600<0.0029 kmax/K1/2 (m−1 min−1)aAt 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).>26,000350 ± 70>74 Relative kcat/KmbFrom competition experiments with ϵA-19mer at 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).0.70 ± 0.100.21 ± 0.05a At 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.2 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).b From competition experiments with ϵA-19mer at 25 °C and pH 7.5 (50 mm MOPS, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA).c The single-turnover rate constants for base excision from 3mC-25mer or 1mA-25mer were independent of Mag1 concentration at 50 nm Mag1, the lowest concentration used in our reactions, and we estimate that we would have been able to detect a dependence for K1/2 of 10 nm or higher (Fig. 3C).d See Fig. S3B for calculation of limit.e See Fig. S6D for calculation of limit.f See Fig. S7D for calculation of limit. Open table in a new tab Although our single-turnover measurements reveal that Mag1 excises alkylated bases from known AlkB substrates, comparison of kcat/Km values for different substrates provides a better measure of substrate specificity. These apparent second-order rate constants, commonly referred to as specificity constants, report on all of the steps up to and including the first irreversible step (26Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999: 103-131Google Scholar); for Mag1 they include the substrate binding and N-glycosidic bond hydrolysis steps. We used direct competition assays to determine relative kcat/Km values for each Mag1 25mer substrate with reference to ϵA-19mer (Figs. 4 and S3). Compared with the previously reported Mag1 substrate, ϵA, both 3mC and ϵC have larger relative kcat/Km values, and 1mA has a relative kcat/Km value within 2-fold of the relative kcat/Km value for ϵA (Table 1). Indeed, 3mC was excised so much faster than ϵA in our competition reactions that we were unable to detect the reaction of the ϵA-19mer reference substrate until most of the 3mC-25mer had undergone reaction. Therefore, only a lower limit of relative kcat/Km >60 for 3mC-25mer could be obtained, indicating that Mag1 has at least a 60-fold preference for 3mC over ϵA. These results indicate that 3mC is a substantially better substrate for Mag1 than ϵA, ϵC, or 1mA, which all have similar relative kcat/Km values of 0.70–2.3 (Table 1). Following our finding that the tpa1Δ yeast strain showed no MMS sensitivity beyond that of WT S. cerevisiae, we tested the ability of purified Tpa1 to repair alkylated ssDNA and duplex DNA in vitro. Recombinant Tpa1 was produced in E. coli, purified, and assayed alongside purified AlkB in the presence of Fe(II) and 2OG. Whereas AlkB completely repaired ϵA, 1mA, 3mC, and ϵC embedded in either ssDNA or dsDNA within 1 h, Tpa1 showed no repair activity on any of these eight substrates even after 29 h (Figs. 5A and S4). We analyzed AlkB, Tpa1, and closely related members of the Fe(II)/2OG-dependent dioxygenase superfamily from human, fruit fly, and fission yeast using the Conserved Domain Database from the NCBI (27Marchler-Bauer A.

https://openalex.org/W2960919022,"Orthostatic tremor (OT) is a rare movement disorder characterized by a fast tremor (13–18 Hz) in the lower extremities during stance. Patients with OT typically complain of instability while standing/walking. However, due to the geographical limitation, the standing instability or gait problems in patients with OT cannot be assessed and monitored frequently. The increasing popularity of using smartphone-based accelerometers could be a solution to eliminate this limitation. This study examined the feasibility of using smartphone-based accelerometers to identify the changes in body movement in different standing and locomotor tasks. Twenty patients with OT and seven healthy controls were consented to participate in this study. Subjects stood with eyes open or eyes closed for 20 seconds. They also performed four different locomotor tasks (normal walking, tandem walk, walking on an elevated surface, and obstacle negotiation). When performed different locomotor tasks, patients with OT had a larger acceleration of body movement than controls in the medial-lateral direction (tandem walk: p = 0.026, walking on an elevated surface: p = 0.002, and stepping over the obstacle: p = 0.028). Patients with OT had smaller acceleration of body movement than controls while standing with eyes open in the vertical direction (p = 0.012), in the anterior-posterior direction (p = 0.013) and in the medial-lateral direction (p = 0.011). This study provides objective evidence of balance instability in patients with OT not only while standing but also during different challenging locomotor tasks by using smartphone-based accelerometers."

Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation within the PPXY motif inhibits rather than promotes ITCH binding, implicating another signaling mechanism by which Txnip is targeted for ubiquitination and proteasome degradation (10.Liu Y.

We now show that cytokine-induced Txnip degradation depends upon the ERK kinase pathway, which facilitates Txnip ubiquitination via phosphorylation of a PXTP motif threonine located in the C-terminal region of the protein. The decline in cell Txnip results in an increase in Trx oxidoreductase activity and subsequent decrease in cell ROS and SNO. We have previously shown that TNFα stimulation of A549 respiratory epithelial cells induces a rapid decrease in cell Txnip levels with concomitant increase in Trx denitrosylase activity (15.Kelleher Z.T.

Pretreatment of A549 cells with the MEK (ERK 1/2) inhibitor U0126 prevented TNFα-induced Txnip degradation 1 h poststimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, A549 cells showed significant ERK activity at baseline (as demonstrated by phosphorylated ERK substrate) and U0126 treatment induced a slight increase in Txnip levels above baseline. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented TNFα-induced Txnip degradation, consistent with our previous observations (15.Kelleher Z.T. Sha Y. Foster M.W. Foster W.M. Forrester M.T.

These data indicate that the ERK pathway plays a crucial role in regulating Txnip expression with the process dependent upon the proteasome. The stimulus-regulated degradation of Txnip protein likely reflects a need for cells to rapidly augment Trx oxidoreductase activity as necessitated by stress-induced redox-signaling and as a means to protect the cell from oxidative and nitrosative stress. In this regard, Txnip has been shown to have a short half-life in vivo that is primarily governed by proteasome degradation (5.Zhang P. Wang C. Gao K. Wang D. Mao J. An J. Xu C. Wu D. Yu H. Liu J.O. Yu L. The ubiquitin ligase Itch regulates apoptosis by targeting thioredoxin-interacting protein for ubiquitin-dependent degradation.J. Biol.

We have shown that the acute decline in A549 cell Txnip levels after TNFα stimulation depends upon enhanced Txnip ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation (15.Kelleher Z.T. Sha Y.

Treatment of A549 cells with the ERK kinase inhibitor U0126 prevented the TNFα-induced increase in Txnip ubiquitination (Fig. 1C). Moreover, ERK inhibition attenuated Txnip ubiquitination even under nonstressed, basal conditions that correlated with changes in Txnip expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Collectively, these data indicate ERK to be a principal regulator of Txnip proteasome degradation under both tonic- and stimulus-mediated conditions. Txnip inhibits Trx oxidoreductase activity by binding to the active site dithiol (1.Patwari P. Higgins L.J. Chutkow W.A. Yoshioka J. Lee R.T. The interaction of thioredoxin with Txnip: evidence for formation of a mixed disulfide by disulfide exchange.J. Biol.

Given the demonstrated role of ERK in regulating cell Txnip levels, we sought to determine whether there was a resultant impact on Trx activity. Using photolysis–chemiluminescence to quantify intracellular SNO, we found SNO levels in A549 cells to be decreased after TNFα stimulation with inhibition of the ERK pathway reversing this effect (Fig. 2A). Although intracellular ROS were unchanged in A549 cells after TNFα stimulation (likely because of concomitant increase in ROS production) (16.Kim H. Hwang J.S. Woo C.H. Kim E.Y. Kim T.H. Cho K.J.

Moreover, Trx disulfide reductase activity was augmented with TNFα stimulation with the effect attenuated by ERK kinase inhibition (Fig. 2C). Importantly, we saw no change in Trx1 protein expression with either ERK inhibition or TNFα stimulation (Fig. 2D and Fig. S1). These data indicate that the ERK kinase pathway functions to regulate Trx activity primarily by controlling degradation of Txnip. The role of phosphorylation in modulating ubiquitin-dependent proteaseomal degradation is well-known, and tyrosine phosphorylation of conserved PPXY motifs in Txnip have been shown to disrupt binding of the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH (5.Zhang P.

Despite achieving >70% sequence coverage of Txnip, including the first PPXY motif (Fig. 3A), we detected phosphorylation of only a single peptide, spanning residues 344–371 of Txnip.

In addition, examination of the extracted ion chromatogram for this peptide suggested that there was a single species (Fig. 3C), whereas phosphopeptides containing differing sites of localization can often be resolved by LC (18.Foster M.W.

Thr349 is located within a canonical PX(S/T)P motif preferred by MAP kinases (including ERK; Fig. 3A). To confirm the phosphorylation at this site, we immunoprecipitated TxnipWT and T349V Txnip (Txnip349V) protein expressed in A549 cells followed by immunoblotting with PXpTP-specific antibody. We found that TxnipWT had basal PXTP phosphorylation that was attenuated by treatment with ERK inhibitor and modestly enhanced by TNFα stimulation (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, PXTP phosphorylation was not detectable in the Txnip349V IP at baseline or after TNFα stimulation, indicating Thr349 to be the kinase effector site. To determine whether Txnip Thr349 is phosphorylated by direct interaction with ERK, we performed an in vitro ERK kinase assay with TxnipWT and Txnip349V expressed in A549 cells and purified by IP. ERK-mediated PXTP phosphorylation was observed only with WT substrate and not the T349V mutant substrate (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, our results establish that Thr349 is the only PXpTP motif site in Txnip and that this site is directly targeted by ERK for phosphorylation. To determine whether phosphorylation of Thr349 facilitates Txnip protein degradation, we performed cyclohexamide (CHX) chase assays on A549 cells expressing either TxnipWT or Txnip349V. Degradation of TxnipWT was observed at 30 and 60 min post-CHX, with TNF enhancing and ERK inhibition attenuating the process, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). On the other hand, the degradation of Txnip349V was not significantly altered by either TNFα stimulation or treatment with ERK inhibitor. We next evaluated the effects of Thr349 mutation on Txnip ubiquitination. Consistent with the effects on Txnip protein degradation, TNFα stimulation significantly enhanced ubiquitination of TxnipWT protein but induced no change in Txnip349V ubiquitination (Fig. 6, A and B). Collectively, these findings establish the importance of the ERK kinase pathway in regulating cell Txnip expression and identify a specific molecular signaling mechanism (phosphorylation of Txnip Thr349) by which ERK targets Txnip for ubiquitination and proteasome degradation with the resultant downstream effect being augmentation of Trx oxidoreductase activity. In the context of redox signaling and under conditions of acute oxidative or nitrosative stress, it is essential that cells have the capability to expeditiously enhance Trx oxidoreductase activity. In this regard, Txnip, an inhibitor of Trx activity and a protein with a half-life tightly regulated by the proteasome, is an ideal mediator. We have previously shown that in the respiratory epithelium, which expresses both constitutive and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (19.Asano K. Chee C.B. Gaston B. Lilly C.M. Gerard C. Drazen J.M.

We now show this response to be mediated by the ERK signaling pathway and that phosphorylation of a single threonine residue in Txnip is critical for the effect. The ERK pathway has long been known to play a protective role in both oxidative and nitrosative cell injury (21.Buckley S. Driscoll B. Barsky L. Weinberg K. Anderson K. Warburton D.

In the respiratory epithelium, oxidant-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and antioxidant-response element–dependent gene transcription has been shown to be dependent on ERK activity (12.Papaiahgari S.

Although Trx expression is regulated, in part, by Nrf2, in the current study we saw no change in Trx expression in A549 cells with either TNFα stimulation or ERK inhibition (Fig. 2D). Rather, the change in Trx activity occurred in conjunction with modification in cellular levels of the Trx inhibitor Txnip. Regulation of intracellular Txnip levels occurs predominantly through enhanced proteasome degradation. The E3 ubiquitin protein ligase ITCH targets Txnip for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation with two PPXY motifs located in the C-terminal region of Txnip instrumental in ITCH–Txnip protein interaction (5.Zhang P.

Phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues inhibits ITCH–Txnip interaction, thus prolonging the half-life of the protein (10.Liu Y. Lau J. Li W. Tempel W. Li L. Dong A. Narula A. Qin S. Min J. Structural basis for the regulatory role of the PPxY motifs in the thioredoxin-interacting protein TXNIP.Biochem.

Interestingly, we did not detect phosphorylation of either tyrosine in our phosphoprotein analysis nor did mutation of the ERK-targeted PXTP phosphorylation site (Thr349) alter ITCH binding to Txnip (Fig. S2). It is possible that the observed increase in Txnip ubiquitination may be the result of Thr349 phosphorylation enhancing transfer of ubiquitin from the E2-conjugating enzyme irrespective of attenuation in ITCH–Txnip interaction. Txnip now joins a growing list of proteins, including c-Myc, STAT1, and the tumor suppressor protein FBW7, in which ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are regulated by ERK-dependent phosphorylation (23.Ji S.

Our results further emphasize the importance of Txnip interaction with Trx in regulating cell ROS and SNOs. Under conditions of oxidative stress, Txnip interaction with Trx-2 in the mitochondria results in activation of ASK1 (Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) and the induction of apoptosis (26.Saxena G.

Txnip-induced increase in ROS has also been demonstrated to augment mitophagy and autophagy with signaling, at least in part, via the mTOR pathway (27.Huang C. Zhang Y. Kelly D.J. Tan C.Y. Gill A.

In turn, ROS have been shown to induce Txnip dissociation from Trx with subsequent binding to NLRP3 and activation of the inflammasome (29.Zhou R. Tardivel A. Thorens B. Choi I. Tschopp J.

Other reagents were purchased from the following vendors: MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and MG132 (Cell Signaling), cycloheximide (Cayman Chemical), ERK2 kinase (Millipore Sigma), phosphatase inhibitors (Abcam), and TNFα (Peprotech). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. A549 (CCL-185) cells were grown in F12K medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK 293-T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cultures were maintained in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For the Txnip overexpression experiments, the cells were infected with lentivirus Txnip expression vectors, and positive transduction was confirmed by puromycin resistance (5.0 μg/ml concentration). After puromycin selection, cell stocks were prepared and stored in liquid nitrogen for later use. Whole cell, cytoplasmic, and nuclear lysates were prepared as previously described (15.Kelleher Z.T.

Quantification of intracellular ROS was determined using a cell-permeable fluorescent dye (cellular ROS detection assay kit; Abcam). A549 cells were grown on 96-well plates and loaded with dye followed by the addition of MEK1/2 inhibitor and TNFα. Fluorescence was then measured using a multiwall fluorimeter (excitation, 520; emission, 605 nm). Trx oxidoreductase activity was measured using a fluorescence-labeled insulin substrate kit (Cayman Chemical). Briefly, cell lysates were preincubated in a 96-well plate with 0.9 mm NADPH for 10 min at 37 °C, after which eosin-labeled insulin was added. Fluorescence intensity was then quantified on a multiwall fluorimeter (excitation, 485; emission, 520 nm) with measurements recorded every 5 min for 50 min to determine the rate of insulin disulfide reduction. A549 cells were infected with lentivirus that expressed either C-terminally FLAG-tagged TxnipWT or Txnip349V. Txnip was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate with anti–FLAG-agarose, resuspended in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MG132, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm DTT, protease and phosphatase inhibitors, 500 μm ATP), and treated with ERK2 kinase (5 ng/μL, 60 min, 30 °C). Proteins were then eluted from agarose beads and separated by SDS-PAGE, and PXTP were immunoblots prepared from IP eluate. A549 cells were lysed in IP buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors). Anti-DYKDDDDK affinity resin (BioLegend) and anti-ubiquitin TUBE resin (LifeSensor) was used to isolate FLAG-tagged Txnip and ubiquitinated proteins, respectively. Resin was washed extensively with IP buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. N-terminal FLAG-tagged Txnip was amplified from human Txnip cDNA (IMAGE clone 7939547) by PCR using the primers: 5′-NheI_FLAG_TXNIP (5′-GCC GTC GCT AGC ACC ATG GAC TAC AAA GAC GAT GAC GAC AAG ATG GTG ATG TTCA AGA AG-3′) and 3′-TXNIP_NotI (5′-GCT TAA GCG GCC GCT CAC TGC ACA TTG TTG TTG AGG-3′) and ligated into the NheI and NotI endonuclease sites of the pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-puro vector (System Biosciences). Mutation of Txnip threonine 349 (to valine) was performed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits (Agilent Technologies) using the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-CGA TTG GAG AGC CCA ACC GTT CCT CTG CTA GAT GAC AT-3′ and 5′-ATG TCA TCT AGC AGA GGA ACG GTT GGG CTC TCC AAT CG-3′.

Supernatants containing lentivirus were collected 48 h post-transfection, filtered with a 0.45-μm filter, and stored at −80 °C. Viral titers were determined by p24 ELISA (Cell Biolabs).

Grain content of glutelin is considerably higher than that of prolamin in rice, but there is limited information on the factors determining the different grain contents of glutelin and prolamin.

Results showed that final glutelin weight per grain was 3.24-3.95 times higher than final prolamin weight per grain. Glutelin and prolamin accumulation processes were well fitted by the logistic equation. The initial, maximum, and mean accumulation rates of glutelin were 1.69-4.67 times higher than those of prolamin. The active accumulation duration of glutelin was 2.9-5.1 d longer than that of prolamin. These results indicate that both higher accumulation rate and longer active accumulation duration are responsible for the higher final weight per grain of glutelin compared to prolamin in rice."

In addition, the incorporation of suicide genes in stem cell-derived cell replacement therapies improves their safety profile by permitting graft destruction in the event of unexpected tumorigeneses or unwanted differentiation. Due to the functional requirement of ATP for the Firefly luciferase gene Luc2 to produce light, luciferase-based reporting of cytotoxicity can be engineered into potential cell therapies. Consequently, we nucleofected mammalian expression plasmids containing both the Luc2 and the yeast fusion cytosine deaminase uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (CDUPRT) genes for expression in murine MSCs to assess luciferase as a reporter of suicide gene cytotoxicity, and MSC as vehicles of suicide gene therapy. In vitro bioluminescence imaging (BLI) showed that following the addition of the non-toxic prodrug fluorocytosine (5-FC), CDUPRT-expressing MSCs displayed enhanced cytotoxicity in comparison to Luc2 reporter MSC controls. This study demonstrates the utility of luciferase as a reporter of CDUPRT-mediated cytotoxicity in murine MSC using BLI."

Two-hundred and four children were assessed for lead at 12 months and closely followed until 24 months for malaria; when symptoms and parasite density were also recorded. Univariate and multivariate negative binomial and linear regression models tested associations between blood lead level quartile and total episodes of malaria (total symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes) and parasite density, respectively. Median blood lead level among children measured at 12 months was 56.50 (4.81–578) μg/L. During the 12-month follow-up, 172 (84.31%) children had at least one malaria episode. Univariate and multivariate negative binomial and linear regressions did not reveal significant associations between blood lead level quartile and malaria outcomes. Iron deficiency was not found to be an effect modifier. Results from this prospective child-cohort study investigating associations between blood lead level and malaria did not confirm results from previous cross-sectional studies.

Fifty years ago, on 20 July 1969, the first humans landed on the surface of another world, when the Apollo 11 lunar module touched down on the Moon. A few hours later, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took the first steps onto an alien surface while Michael Collins orbited overhead in the command module.

The motivation for this milestone of space exploration was geopolitical, not scientific. The Apollo program was intended to demonstrate technological supremacy during the Cold War space race. Yet Apollo 11 and the five additional crewed landings that followed have left a rich scientific legacy. They carried a variety of instruments, including seismometers, magnetometers, and retroreflectors for laser ranging observations. Perhaps their greatest scientific value lies in the 382 kg of rocks and regolith (lunar soil) that were brought back to Earth. Laboratory analysis of these samples revolutionized our understanding of how the Moon, Earth, and other planets formed. Improved technology and advances in planetary science mean that the samples are still actively studied today.

Funding for lunar exploration soon ran out. No humans have traveled beyond low Earth orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972, and even robotic missions to the Moon ceased between 1976 and 1990. The 21st century has seen a renewed interest in exploring our nearest neighbor, in part because a growing number of space agencies and private companies now have the capability to reach it. Some have plans to return humans to the lunar surface over the next decade. Even more ambitious are ideas for permanent lunar bases, such as astronomical observatories, which could reap a rich scientific harvest.

One day humans will return to the Moon. Until then, the Apollo landings stand alone at the pinnacle of crewed space exploration.
