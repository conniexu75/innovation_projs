https://openalex.org/W2125346198,"We report the draft genome of the black cottonwood tree, Populus trichocarpa . Integration of shotgun sequence assembly with genetic mapping enabled chromosome-scale reconstruction of the genome. More than 45,000 putative protein-coding genes were identified. Analysis of the assembled genome revealed a whole-genome duplication event; about 8000 pairs of duplicated genes from that event survived in the Populus genome. A second, older duplication event is indistinguishably coincident with the divergence of the Populus and Arabidopsis lineages. Nucleotide substitution, tandem gene duplication, and gross chromosomal rearrangement appear to proceed substantially more slowly in Populus than in Arabidopsis. Populus has more protein-coding genes than Arabidopsis , ranging on average from 1.4 to 1.6 putative Populus homologs for each Arabidopsis gene. However, the relative frequency of protein domains in the two genomes is similar. Overrepresented exceptions in Populus include genes associated with lignocellulosic wall biosynthesis, meristem development, disease resistance, and metabolite transport."
https://openalex.org/W2165730296,"We observed robust coupling between the high- and low-frequency bands of ongoing electrical activity in the human brain. In particular, the phase of the low-frequency theta (4 to 8 hertz) rhythm modulates power in the high gamma (80 to 150 hertz) band of the electrocorticogram, with stronger modulation occurring at higher theta amplitudes. Furthermore, different behavioral tasks evoke distinct patterns of theta/high gamma coupling across the cortex. The results indicate that transient coupling between low- and high-frequency brain rhythms coordinates activity in distributed cortical areas, providing a mechanism for effective communication during cognitive processing in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2047166938,"Understanding and controlling the complex environment of solid-state quantum bits is a central challenge in spintronics and quantum information science. Coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond was used to gain insight into its local environment. We show that this environment is effectively separated into a set of individual proximal 13C nuclear spins, which are coupled coherently to the electron spin, and the remainder of the 13C nuclear spins, which cause the loss of coherence. The proximal nuclear spins can be addressed and coupled individually because of quantum back-action from the electron, which modifies their energy levels and magnetic moments, effectively distinguishing them from the rest of the nuclei. These results open the door to coherent manipulation of individual isolated nuclear spins in a solid-state environment even at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2083144176,"We used nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion to characterize higher energy conformational substates of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase. Each intermediate in the catalytic cycle samples low-lying excited states whose conformations resemble the ground-state structures of preceding and following intermediates. Substrate and cofactor exchange occurs through these excited substates. The maximum hydride transfer and steady-state turnover rates are governed by the dynamics of transitions between ground and excited states of the intermediates. Thus, the modulation of the energy landscape by the bound ligands funnels the enzyme through its reaction cycle along a preferred kinetic path."
https://openalex.org/W2014560881,"The double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039A/B is unique in that both neutron stars are detectable as radio pulsars. They are also known to have much higher mean orbital velocities and accelerations than those of other binary pulsars. The system is therefore a good candidate for testing Einstein's theory of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime. We report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5 years since its discovery and present four independent strong-field tests of general relativity. These tests use the theory-independent mass ratio of the two stars. By measuring relativistic corrections to the Keplerian description of the orbital motion, we find that the “post-Keplerian” parameter s agrees with the value predicted by general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05%, the most precise test yet obtained. We also show that the transverse velocity of the system's center of mass is extremely small. Combined with the system's location near the Sun, this result suggests that future tests of gravitational theories with the double pulsar will supersede the best current solar system tests. It also implies that the second-born pulsar may not have formed through the core collapse of a helium star, as is usually assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2075448644,"The wave nature of light limits the spatial resolution in classical microscopy to about half of the illumination wavelength. Recently, a new approach capable of achieving subwavelength spatial resolution, called superlensing, was invented, challenging the already established method of scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM). We combine the advantages of both techniques and demonstrate a novel imaging system where the objects no longer need to be in close proximity to a near-field probe, allowing for optical near-field microscopy of subsurface objects at sub-wavelength-scale lateral resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2073097129,"Lantibiotics are polycyclic peptides containing unusual amino acids, which have binding specificity for bacterial cells, targeting the bacterial cell wall component lipid II to form pores and thereby lyse the cells. Yet several members of these lipid II-targeted lantibiotics are too short to be able to span the lipid bilayer and cannot form pores, but somehow they maintain their antibacterial efficacy. We describe an alternative mechanism by which members of the lantibiotic family kill Gram-positive bacteria by removing lipid II from the cell division site (or septum) and thus block cell wall synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2073610126,"Projected anthropogenic warming and increases in CO2 concentration present a twofold threat, both from climate changes and from CO2 directly through increasing the acidity of the oceans. Future climate change may be reduced through mitigation (reductions in greenhouse gas emissions) or through geoengineering. Most geoengineering approaches, however, do not address the problem of increasing ocean acidity. A combined mitigation/geoengineering strategy could remove this deficiency. Here we consider the deliberate injection of sulfate aerosol precursors into the stratosphere. This action could substantially offset future warming and provide additional time to reduce human dependence on fossil fuels and stabilize CO2 concentrations cost-effectively at an acceptable level."
https://openalex.org/W2148026632,"Alzheimer disease is a neurological disorder that is characterized by the presence of fibrils and oligomers composed of the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide. In models of Alzheimer disease, overexpression of molecular chaperones, specifically heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), suppresses phenotypes related to Aβ aggregation. These observations led to the hypothesis that chaperones might interact with Aβ and block self-association. However, although biochemical evidence to support this model has been collected in other neurodegenerative systems, the interaction between chaperones and Aβ has not been similarly explored. Here, we examine the effects of Hsp70/40 and Hsp90 on Aβ aggregation in vitro. We found that recombinant Hsp70/40 and Hsp90 block Aβ self-assembly and that these chaperones are effective at substoichiometric concentrations (∼1:50). The anti-aggregation activity of Hsp70 can be inhibited by a nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog and encouraged by pharmacological stimulation of its ATPase activity. Finally, we were interested in discerning what type of amyloid structures can be acted upon by these chaperones. To address this question, we added Hsp70/40 and Hsp90 to pre-formed oligomers and fibrils. Based on thioflavin T reactivity, the combination of Hsp70/40 and Hsp90 caused structural changes in oligomers but had little effect on fibrils. These results suggest that if these chaperones are present in the same cellular compartment in which Aβ is produced, Hsp70/40 and Hsp90 may suppress the early stages of self-assembly. Thus, these results are consistent with a model in which pharmacological activation of chaperones might have a favorable therapeutic effect on Alzheimer disease.

Despite these important observations, numerous questions about the basis of disease are unanswered. For example, although there is active research in this area (8Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Protein Pept.

Moreover, the subcellular site(s) of oligomer production and the conditions that lead to their assembly are still debated; fibrils are found in extracellular space, but there is growing evidence that oligomers may be produced in intracellular compartments (8Walsh D.M.

One of the important consequences of the oligomer hypothesis is that it implies that therapeutic benefits could arise from preventing early (i.e. pre-oligomeric) stages of amyloid formation. Accordingly, small molecules that directly block Aβ aggregation (20Findeis M.A. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Gestwicki J.E. Crabtree G.R.

Med. 2004; 140: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The goal of most of these approaches is to intervene at a stage prior to oligomerization and prevent accumulation. Consistent with this idea, it has been suggested that stimulating natural cellular mechanisms that combat protein aggregation, including proteases that digest Aβ and chaperones that inhibit misfolding, might have therapeutic benefit (31Westerheide S.D. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33097-33100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 32Morelli L. Llovera R. Ibendahl S. Castano E.M. Neurochem.

Molecular chaperones are involved in many important aspects of protein homeostasis, including folding, degradation, and subcellular trafficking (for recent reviews see Refs. 34Wegele H.

These tasks typically involve the heat shock proteins, such as Hsp70 and Hsp90, which are chaperones that recognize misfolded polypeptides and use energy-driven cycles of substrate binding and release to favor productive folding (reviewed in Refs. 37Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar and 38Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Vander Kooi C.W. Feng H.P. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)). One of the important consequences of chaperone binding is that deleterious protein aggregation is prevented. Consistent with this activity, numerous studies have suggested that heat shock proteins are important for the prevention of amyloid formation (31Westerheide S.D. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol.

For example, genetic overexpression of Hsp70 has been shown to reduce amyloid-related phenotypes in mouse models of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (44Cummings C.J. Sun Y. Opal P. Antalffy B.

These experiments suggest that chaperones, particularly Hsp70, may bind amyloidogenic peptides and help prevent disease by restoring the balance between aggregation and folding. This hypothesis is supported by biochemical evidence in some systems. For example, purified Hsp70 blocks aggregation of α-synuclein, a protein implicated in Parkinson disease, in vitro (50Dedmon M.M. Christodoulou J. Wilson M.R. Dobson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14733-14740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Similarly, addition of Hsp70 and its co-chaperone partner, Hsp40, to Huntingtin, an aggregationprone protein that causes Huntington disease, blocks oligomer formation (43Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 51Wacker J.L. Zareie M.H. Fong H. Sarikaya M. Muchowski P.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In addition to these findings, other chaperones, such as Hsp20 (52Lee S. Carson K. Rice-Ficht A. Good T. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and Hsp104 (53Shorter J. Lindquist S. Science. 2004; 304: 1793-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), have been shown to limit amyloid formation in vitro. Together, the combination of genetic and biochemical evidence provides compelling support for a direct role of chaperones in these diseases. In Alzheimer disease, genetic evidence to suggest a role for chaperones has been reported (54Magrane J. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Querfurth H.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1700-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but corresponding biochemical analysis is lacking. Similar to what occurs in other disease models, Hsp70 overexpression improves the viability of cells that express excess Aβ (54Magrane J. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Querfurth H.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1700-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Additionally, abundant chaperone levels block formation of Aβ aggregates in C. elegans (49Fonte V. Kapulkin V. Taft A. Fluet A. Friedman D. Link C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9439-9444Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence would help elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for these favorable effects. For example, the type of Aβ structure (e.g. monomers, oligomers, and/or fibrils) bound by chaperone is not known. Moreover, it is not clear how much chaperone is required or if this process is ATP-driven. Here we define a role for specific molecular chaperones, Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp90, in the prevention of Aβ fibril formation in vitro. The results of these experiments and a comparison with what has been observed in other amyloid diseases are discussed. Preparation of Amyloid β—Synthetic amyloid β-(1–42) (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA) was prepared for aggregation according to methods developed previously (55Fezoui Y. Hartley D.M. Harper J.D. Khurana R. Walsh D.M. Condron M.M. Selkoe D.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Fink A.L. Teplow D.B. Amyloid. 2000; 7: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 56Stine Jr., W.B. Dahlgren K.N. Krafft G.A. LaDuca M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11612-11622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Briefly, lyophilized Aβ was resuspended in hexafluoroisopropanol, dried under a nitrogen stream, and stored as a film at –20 °C. Immediately prior to use, Aβ was resuspended in Me2SO to 10 mm and sonicated for 10 min. For experiments in which early stages of aggregation were studied, these aliquots were rapidly brought to 25 μm in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and used immediately. Oligomers were prepared by diluting the Aβ to 25 μm with phenol red-free DMEM-F12 and incubating for 24 h at 4 °C without shaking. Fibrils were similarly prepared by incubating 25 μm Aβ in PBS at 37 °C for 24 h with vigorous shaking. Turbidity Measurements—Human Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp90 were provided by Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI). Hsp70 (catalog number ESP-555) is endotoxin-free, recombinant human protein expressed and purified from bacteria; Hsp40 (SPP-400) is also recombinant human protein and from bacteria; Hsp90 (SPP-770) is human and purified from HeLa cells. Concentrated stocks (×100) of these proteins or buffer control were dispensed into the wells of 96-well, half-volume, clear bottom plates (Corning Glass, Corning, NY). To these solutions, Aβ in either PBS or DMEM-F12 was added. In the final volume (75 μl), Aβ was present at ∼25 μm and ATP or ATPγSat 9 mm, and the heat shock proteins were at the indicated concentrations. Plates were immediately placed in a pre-warmed SpectraMax M5 multimode plate reader, and the turbidity measurements were initiated. The turbidity program began with a 20-s mixing shake and was followed by absorbance readings at 330 or 350 nm every 60 s. A 20-s shaking step immediately followed each reading, followed by 40 s of settling time. The temperature was set at 30 or 37 °C (see figure legends). For Hsp70/40-treated samples, the listed concentration is the concentration of Hsp70, and the Hsp40 was held at 100-fold lower value. For example, treatment with 474 nm Hsp70/40 involved final concentrations of 474 nm Hsp70 and 4.7 nm Hsp40. Electron Microscopy—At the conclusion of the turbidity measurements, 25-μl aliquots were removed from each well and immediately frozen at –80 °C. Thawed samples were placed on glow-discharged Formvar-coated 300-mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 1 min, washed twice with distilled water, and treated with 3% uranyl acetate for 1 min. Images were taken at 80 kV at magnifications between 46,000 and 130,000. Image quantitation was performed with NIH Image using at least 10 random fields. Thioflavin T Experiments—Immediately following removal of samples for electron microscopy, the remaining volume from the turbidity experiments (50 μl) was treated with 75 μl of freshly prepared 50 mm glycine, pH 8.0, containing 25 μm thioflavin T. After 10 min at room temperature, the fluorescence was measured on a SpectraMax M5 multimode plate reader using an excitation of 440 nm and emission of 490 nm (475 nm cut-off). The reported values have been corrected by subtracting the background fluorescence of thioflavin T in the absence of amyloid. Synthesis—The synthesis of SW02, SW08, and related compounds is described in more detail elsewhere. 3S. Wisén and J. E. Gestwicki, submitted for publication. Briefly, SW02 is prepared by coupling the urea of γ-aminobutyric acid to Wang resin in dimethylformamide using standard conditions. After washing to remove excess coupling agents, an acid-catalyzed three-component Biginelli reaction was performed in the presence of four equivalents of p-bromobenzylaldehyde and ethyl acetoacetate (58Kappe C.O. Stadler A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 369: 197-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The yields and kinetics of this reaction were greatly enhanced by the use of microwave-accelerated conditions (110 °C, 40 min; Biotage Initiator EXP). The yellow product was cleaved from resin with 50% trifluoroacetic acid and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. SW02 was characterized by mass spectrometry (calculated m/z = 438.06; observed = 439.0 [M + H]) and 1H NMR. SW08 was prepared in similar fashion (expected m/z = 737.4; observed = 738.4 [M + H]). Note that in experiments outlined in Fig. 4, SW02 was added to chaperone concentrations (119 nm) selected to be suboptimal for preventing aggregation. This was done to favor visualization of the effects of the small molecule. However, this chaperone concentration occasionally inhibited aggregation in the absence of drug, and in these cases, SW02 was unable to boost the potency further. Recombinant Hsp70/40 Blocks Aggregation of Freshly Prepared Amyloid β-(1–42)—Results from overexpression experiments have suggested a role for Hsp70 in the aggregation of amyloid β (54Magrane J. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Querfurth H.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1700-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but evidence for this interaction in vitro is lacking. To explore this question, freshly prepared amyloid β-(1–42) was treated with recombinant Hsp70 and its co-chaperone Hsp40 in the presence of excess ATP. Hsp40 stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsp70 (59Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 60Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) at a low molar ratio (100:1 Hsp70:40). Thus, the goal of these experiments was to establish if an activated Hsp70/40 combination could inhibit amyloid formation. In our initial experiments, we monitored turbidity to discern the extent of Aβ self-assembly (7Soto C. Castano E.M. Frangione B. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the results of these experiments revealed that Hsp70/40 is a potent substoichiometric inhibitor (Fig. 1A). At a molar ratio of ∼1:50 (overall chaperone:Aβ), Hsp70/40 significantly slowed the rate of aggregation and delayed the onset time. This effect was dependent on chaperone concentration, and lowering the levels to less than ∼1:200 abolished inhibition. To confirm these results under different conditions, we employed the well known thioflavin T assay. Thioflavin T is an indicator dye that becomes strongly fluorescent in the presence of amyloid (61LeVine III, H. Scholten J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Confirming the turbidity results, there was a strong dose-dependent decrease in fluorescence after 80 min of treatment with chaperones (Fig. 1B). Finally, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the ultrastructure of the chaperone-treated samples. These experiments revealed that, rather than forming fibrils, Aβ was redirected into roughly circular structures by Hsp70/40 (Fig. 1C). Although these spheres were prevalent, short fibrils were occasionally observed, which suggests that some Aβ escapes the block. Furthermore, the barrier to aggregation was not complete; over the time course studied, the initial rate of assembly was slowed but not entirely stopped. The Combination of Hsp70/40 Is More Effective than Hsp70 Alone—Hsp40 is a known co-chaperone and stimulator of the ATPase activity of Hsp70 (62Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested in understanding if the combination of Hsp70/40 is more effective than Hsp70 alone. This result would suggest that ATPase activity is important for the anti-aggregation function of Hsp70. To test this idea, we treated Aβ with Hsp70 or the combination (100:1 Hsp70:40) and monitored aggregation by the thioflavin T assay. Consistent with reports in other systems (50Dedmon M.M. Christodoulou J. Wilson M.R. Dobson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14733-14740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), Hsp70 alone blocks aggregation (Fig. 2). However, when we added low levels of Hsp40 to Hsp70, we found an enhancement over the chaperone alone. As a control, we tested whether Hsp40 could inhibit aggregation in the absence of its partner. We found that Hsp40 failed to block Aβ self-assembly, even at 10-fold higher concentrations (50 nm) than those used in the previous experiments. Therefore, we conclude that, although both Hsp70 and Hsp70/40 prevent amyloid formation in vitro, the combination is most effective. Recombinant Hsp90 Blocks Aggregation of Freshly Prepared Amyloid β-(1–42)—Although Hsp70 and Hsp40 have both been implicated in counteracting amyloid formation in certain neurodegenerative systems, Hsp90 has attracted less attention. In one in vitro model, Hsp90 has been shown to be insufficient to prevent amyloid formation (43Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). However, Hsp90 is an important and highly abundant component of the chaperone machinery that shares some pro-folding tasks with other heat shock proteins (for a recent review see Refs. 36Bukau B. Weissman J. Horwich A. Cell. 2006; 125: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar and 37Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To explore potential roles of this chaperone in Aβ aggregation, we performed similar experiments to those described in the preceding section. Similar to what we observed with Hsp70/40, Hsp90 provided a strong dose-dependent block to amyloid formation when added to freshly prepared Aβ samples (Fig. 3). The peak of the anti-aggregation activity of Hsp90 was also observed at substoichiometric concentrations (between 1:50 and 1:200). TEM images revealed that Aβ in the Hsp90-treated samples was again re-directed into small, roughly circular structures instead of fibrils. Thus, both Hsp70/40 and Hsp90 could partially prevent assembly of freshly prepared Aβ in vitro. ATPase Activity Is Required for Chaperones to Block Aggregation—Because the ATP- and ADP-bound forms of Hsp70 have different affinities for peptide substrate (for a review see Ref. 59Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar), we sought to study the role of ATPase activity in preventing Aβ aggregation. Our results (see Fig. 2) suggest that Hsp40-enhanced ATP turnover may be important, but we sought additional evidence using a complementary approach. Therefore, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, was employed. Freshly prepared Aβ was treated with Hsp70/40 or Hsp90 in the presence of either ATP or ATPγS. Turbidity and thioflavin T measurements revealed that these inhibitory effects of the chaperone are partially disrupted by ATPγS (Fig. 4). However, we found that Hsp70 had a stronger requirement for ATPase activity than Hsp90; ATPγS disrupted nearly all of anti-aggregation activity of Hsp70, but over 50% of function for the Hsp90 remained. Thus, these results suggest that the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis is required for anti-aggregation activity of the Hsp70 but that Hsp90 only partly depends on its enzymatic function. As part of these studies, we also were interested in determining if any protein might substitute for the chaperones. To explore this possibility, we attempted to block amyloid formation with bovine serum albumin (BSA). At the highest concentrations used (474 nm, equivalent to the top chaperone levels employed), no effect on Aβ aggregation was observed (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with previous reports using non-chaperone proteins (43Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), and demonstrate that the chaperone interaction cannot be replaced by contacts with the BSA interface. An Hsp70 Agonist Promot"

Treatment of cav1-/- mice with glucose (which is a predominant energy substrate when compared to lipids) drastically increased survival and reestablished progression of the cell cycle.

Point mutations in the signal that abolished binding of CFP-10 to Rv3871 prevented secretion of the CFP-10 (culture filtrate protein, 10 kilodaltons)/ESAT-6 virulence factor complex.

These prodrugs are reduced to their active amidines. Other N-hydroxylated structures are mutagenic or responsible for toxic effects of drugs and are detoxified by reduction. In this study, a N-reductive enzyme system of pig liver mitochondria using benzamidoxime as a model substrate was identified. A protein fraction free from cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 reductase was purified, enhancing 250-fold the minor benzamidoxime-reductase activity catalyzed by the membrane-bound cytochrome b5/NADH cytochrome b5 reductase system.

Numerous drugs and drug candidates contain strongly basic functional groups, such as guanidines, amidinohydrazones, and amidines. These groups, however, impair drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, because they are protonated under physiological conditions. Therefore, the prodrug principle was developed to enhance oral bioavailability (1Ettmayer P. Amidon G.L. Clement B. Testa B. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 2393-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the case of amidines, N-hydroxylation converts them to the corresponding N-hydroxyamidines that are less basic and therefore unprotonated under physiological conditions, thereby enhancing intestinal absorption by diffusion (2Clement B. Drug Metab. Rev. 2002; 34: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This prodrug principle was applied to a wide range of mainly antiprotozoal and antithrombotic drugs (2Clement B. Drug Metab. Rev. 2002; 34: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The wider application of amidoxime prodrugs requires the identification of the cellular N-reducing enzyme system.

The latter are components of an electron transport system associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane and the endoplasmatic reticulum in somatic cells (9Sottocasa G.L. Kuylenstierna B. Ernster L. Bergstrand A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar), where they mediate electron transfer from NADH to a variety of final acceptors involved in lipid metabolism, such as fatty acid desaturase (10Strittmatter P.

Later a similar microsomal enzyme system was described: a microsomal N-hydroxy reductase (8Clement B. Lomb R. Moller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19615-19620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), consisting of the membrane-bound electron transfer chain described above and a postulated microsomal P450 isoenzyme (Fig. 1) as N-reductive protein that should be able to reduce N-hydroxylated derivatives of amidines, sulfonamides, and numerous other N-hydroxylated functional groups (8Clement B. Lomb R. Moller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19615-19620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Clement B. Behrens D. Amschler J. Matschke K. Wolf S. Havemeyer A.

The necessity of an additional N-reductive enzyme of the membrane-bound microsomal drug metabolism system was confirmed by Andersson et al. (3Andersson S. Hofmann Y. Nordling A. Li X.Q. Nivelius S. Andersson T.B. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Johansson I. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although the identity of the third protein remained open. Recently, it was found that also the outer mitochondrial membrane harbored a N-reductive system (4Clement B. Mau S. Deters S. Havemeyer A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 1740-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) similar to the one of microsomes, and a third protein component was postulated to be necessary for N-reduction. Here the identification of this third N-reductive component in the outer mitochondrial membrane of pig liver is described. It turned out to be a novel molybdenum-containing protein hitherto not described in eukaryotes or bacteria sharing significant homology with the C-terminal domain of the molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (HMCS-CT). Purification of the N-Reductive Mitochondrial Component—Pig liver mitochondria were obtained by differential centrifugation and an isotonic Percoll gradient (15Hovius R. Lambrechts H.

This solubilization mixture was stirred for 60 min on ice. The solubilized membrane fraction (∼13 mg of protein) was applied to a DEAE-52 column (2.5 × 10 cm) (DEAE 52-Cellulose Servacel®; Serva Electrophoresis, Heidelberg, Germany) and equilibrated with buffer (20 mm Tris-base, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (m/v) glycerol, 0.9 mm Zwittergent® 3-14, pH 7.4). After sample application, the column was washed at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with two column volumes of the equilibrating buffer and was developed with a linear concentration gradient (250 ml) of 0–1.0 sodium chloride in equilibrating buffer. Fractions of 4 ml were collected and assayed. Active fractions were pooled and stored at –80 °C. All operations were performed at 0–4 °C. Protein was assayed using bicinchonic acid (17Smith P.K.

SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out by the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar), with a 5% stacking gel. Staining was performed with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Standards and samples were pretreated with β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 90 °C. Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) peptide mass finger printing or nanocapillary liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The analysis were performed by Planton GmbH (Kiel, Germany) and Richard Jones (National Center for Toxicological Research). Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed by gel-blotting protein-fraction A and B subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE using a primary polyclonal antibody raised against recombinantly expressed C terminus of Arabidopsis thaliana molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (ABA3-CT) (1:7000 dilution). The secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Sigma) was used in a 1:10,000 dilution, and chemiluminescence was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). nit-1 Reconstitution—Neurospora crassa nit-1 extract was prepared as described previously (20Nason A. Lee K.Y. Pan S.S. Ketchum P.A. Lamberti A. DeVries J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and stored in aliquots at –70 °C. All reconstitutions were performed in nit-1 buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) containing 2 mm reduced glutathione either in the absence or in the presence of 5 mm sodium molybdate. The reconstitution assay was performed in a 40-μl reaction volume containing 20 μl of gel-filtrated nit-1 extract. Complementation was carried out anaerobically for 2 h at room temperature. After the addition of 20 mm NADPH and incubation for 10 min in the dark, reconstituted NADPH-nitrate reductase activity was determined as described (20Nason A. Lee K.Y. Pan S.S. Ketchum P.A.

Importantly, the addition of sodium molybdate to the reaction mix did not significantly enhance reconstitution of NADPH-nitrate reductase activity, indicating that all fractions tested contained molybdenum cofactor (Moco) rather than molybdenum-free molybdopterin. Cloning of hmcs-CT—Polymerase chain reaction was performed with a human liver cDNA library (λ-Uni-ZAP XR, Stratagene) as template and by using primers HMCS-1429+ (5′-GGA TAC ATG TCG ACG CTG GAT GAT-3′) and HMCS-stop (5′-TTA GGA GGT AAC ATC CTG GTG TTT CTC-3′) derived from GenBank™ entry AK000740, which represents a full-length hmcs-cDNA. By this procedure, a partial hmcs cDNA fragment of ∼1.3 kb was obtained, which contained the 3′-region of the hmcs open reading frame and whose correctness was confirmed by sequencing. Restriction sites for BamHI were introduced by polymerase chain reaction using primers HMCS-CT-start/BamHI (5′-ACC CAG GGA TCC ATG TCA GAG AAA GCT GCA GGA GTC CTG-3′) and HMCS-CT-stop/BamHI (5′-ACG GTG GAT CCT TAG GAG GTA ACA TCC TGG TGT TTC TC-3′), which amplified the last 966 bp of the open reading frame encoding for the putative C-terminal domain of HMCS. Simultaneous introduction of an ATG codon at the N-terminal end in frame with the vector-encoded His6 tag enabled cloning into the pQE80-plasmid (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), thereby allowing expression of a His6-HMCS-CT fusion protein with an estimated molecular mass of 37.4 kDa. Cloning and expression of ABA3-CT for generation of anti-ABA3-CT polyclonal antibodies was performed as described earlier by Heidenreich et al. (21Heidenreich T. Wollers S. Mendel R.R. Bittner F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4213-4218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of HMCS-CT—Routine protein expression was performed in freshly transformed Escherichia coli TP1000 cells (22Palmer T. Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cells were grown aerobically in Luria broth medium in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 22 °C to a A600 = 0.1 before induction with 15 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and the addition of 1 mm sodium molybdate. After induction, cells were grown for a further 20 h at 22 °C. Expression in E. coli strains RK5206 and RK5204 (23Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out likewise without the addition of sodium molybdate. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –70 °C until use. Cell lysis was achieved by several passages through a French pressure cell followed by sonication for 5 min. After centrifugation, His6-tagged protein was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow matrix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) under native conditions at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's manual. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Molybdenum binding pterin bound to the purified proteins was detected and quantified by converting it to the stable oxidation product FormA-dephospho, according to Johnson et al. (24Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6856-6860Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Oxidation, dephosphorylation, QAE chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis were performed as described previously (25Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). FormA-dephospho was quantified by comparison with a standard isolated from xanthine oxidase for which the absorptivity was ϵ380 = 13,200 m–1 cm–1 (24Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6856-6860Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Thereby, average saturation of HMCS-CT with MPT/Moco, determined as FormA-dephospho, was found to be about 41% (412 ± 96 pmol of FormA/nmol of protein; n = 5). NADH Cyt b5 Reductase Activity—Enzyme activity was determined by modification of the ferricyanide reduction assay (26Mihara K. Sato R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Heme Content—Heme content was estimated by recording the sodium dithionite-reduced minus the oxidized spectrum (27Estabrook R.W. Werringloer J. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Assay for the Reduction of Benzamidoxime—For determination of benzamidoxime reduction, incubations were carried out under aerobic conditions at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Incubation mixtures of the subcellular fractions contained 56 μg (mitochondria) or 6 μg of protein (OMV fraction), 0.5 mm benzamidoxime (synthesized from benzonitrile and hydroxylamine as described in Ref. 28Krüger P. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1885; 18: 1055-1060Crossref Google Scholar), and 1.0 mm NADH (or 0.4 mm NADH in the case of the OMV fraction) in a total volume of 150 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. After preincubation for 3 min at 37 °C, the reaction was initiated by the addition of NADH and terminated after 15 min (OMV fraction) or 20 min (mitochondria) by adding aliquots of methanol. If not otherwise stated, standard incubation mixtures of the reconstituted system contained 240 ng of purified mitochondrial enzyme fraction, 0.3 units of cyt b5 reductase, 100 pmol of recombinant purified cyt b5 (MoBiTec GmbH, Göttingen, Germany), 0.5 mm benzamidoxime, and 1.0 mm NADH in a total volume of 150 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. After preincubation for 3 min at 37 °C, the reaction was started by NADH and terminated after 15 or 30 min by adding aliquots of methanol. If not otherwise stated, incubations with HMCS-CT contained 135 μg of recombinant protein, 0.5 mm benzamidoxime, and 1.0 mm NADH in a total volume of 150 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. After preincubation for 3 min at 37 °C, the reaction was started by benzamidoxime and terminated after 10 min by adding aliquots of methanol. The precipitated proteins were sedimented by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC. Inhibition Studies—Incubations with the OMV fraction were performed as described above with slight modifications. After 5 min of preincubation of protein, inhibitor, and NADH, the reaction was started by the addition of benzamidoxime. Studies were performed with 0–100 μm sodium vanadate. HPLC Method for Benzamidine Quantification—The separation was carried out isocratically by 10 mm 1-octylsulfonate sodium salt and 17% acetonitrile (v/v) (pH not adjusted) by a LiChroCART® 250-4 HPLC-Cartridge with LiChrospher® 60 RP-select B (5 μm) and a LiChroCART® 4-4 guard column (Merck) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 229 nm. For the determination of the recovery rate, reaction mixtures with defined concentrations of synthetic reference substance (1–300 μm) were incubated and worked up under the same conditions as the experimental samples but without adding cofactor. The standard curves were linear over this range with correlation coefficients of 0.999 (n = 48). The signals (peak areas) obtained were compared with those of the same amount of benzamidine dissolved in the mobile phase. The recovery rate from pig liver mitochondria amounted to 105% (r2 = 0.9993). Similar values were obtained from the OMV fraction. The retention times were 7.9 ± 0.1 min (benzamidoxime) and 26.7 ± 0.1 min (benzamidine). Mass Spectrometry—The formation of the reductive metabolite benzamidine was examined by mass spectrometry according to the method described by Froehlich et al. (29Frohlich A.K. Girreser U. Clement B. Xenobiotica. 2005; 35: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Purification of a N-Reductive Protein Fraction—Identification of the third N-reductive component in the outer mitochondrial membrane remained elusive in previous studies. Therefore, a rigorously improved purification protocol was elaborated (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”) consisting of three main steps. (i) The OMV fraction was prepared from pig liver mitochondria (4Clement B. Mau S. Deters S. Havemeyer A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 1740-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). (ii) The membrane-bound N-reductive enzyme complex was solubilized in a stable and highly active form. Here, Zwittergent® 3-14 turned out to be superior to all other detergents (CHAPS, cholate, digitonin, thesit, and Triton X-100) tested, and full N-reductive activity was retained up to a detergent/protein ratio of 5. The activity was stable over a period of 6 days at 4 °C. Vanadate as inhibitor of benzamidoxime reductase almost abolished the N-reductive activity of the outer mitochondrial membrane, exerting an IC50 value of 8 μm. (iii) ion exchange chromatography of detergent-solubilized OMV fractions gave two pools (designated as fractions A and B) with benzamidoxime reductase activity (Fig. 2). Fraction A was devoid of any heme content (as tested by dithionite-reduced difference spectra) and of cyt b5 reductase activity, whereas fraction B contained minor contents of cyt b5 and its reductase. Therefore, fraction A was used for further analysis. Purification parameters are given in Table 1, and the results of SDS-PAGE analysis are shown in Fig. 3. The purified enzyme fraction A was stored at –80 °C, and the same activity in the reconstituted system was observed at least after one freezethaw cycle (data not shown).TABLE 1Purification of mitochondrial N-reductive componentsStageTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldμmol/minmgμmol/min/mg-fold%Swell disruption homogenate36.520270.02aSpecific benzamidoxime reductase activity of membrane preparations (μmol/min/mg of total protein).1100Solubilized OMV fraction30.3130.23aSpecific benzamidoxime reductase activity of membrane preparations (μmol/min/mg of total protein).138Fraction A1.90.1910bSpecific benzamidoxime reductase activity of the reconstituted system (μmol/min/mg of protein of fraction A).556cCalculated to specific activity of the reconstituted system.5cCalculated to specific activity of the reconstituted system.a Specific benzamidoxime reductase activity of membrane preparations (μmol/min/mg of total protein).b Specific benzamidoxime reductase activity of the reconstituted system (μmol/min/mg of protein of fraction A).c Calculated to specific activity of the reconstituted system.

Fraction A alone was not able to catalyze the reduction of benzamidoxime by NADH (Table 2). The low rate of benzamidoxime reduction obtained with the mitochondrial fraction A and purified NADH cyt b5 reductase (Table 2) is caused by the contamination of the reductase with small amounts of cyt b5. Similar results were obtained when replacing purified microsomal NADH cyt b5 reductase by purified recombinant NADH cyt b5 reductase (not shown). The N-reductive activity of the standard incubation mixture followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (apparent Km 0.18 mm, Vmax was 12.25 μmol of benzamidine/min/mg of fraction A).TABLE 2N-Reduction of benzamidoxime by the reconstituted systemComposition of incubation mixtureSpecific activityFraction ATotal proteinμmol/min/mgnmol/min/mgComplete incubation mixture10.0 ± 0.14517 ± 7Complete incubation mixture with heat-denaturated fraction ANDaND, not detectable (below the limit of detection); limit of detection = 17 nmol/min/mg of fraction A.NDbND, not detectable (below the limit of detection); limit of detection = 1 nmol/min/mg of total protein.Complete incubation mixture without NADHNDaND, not detectable (below the limit of detection); limit of detection = 17 nmol/min/mg of fraction A.NDbND, not detectable (below the limit of detection); limit of detection = 1 nmol/min/mg of total protein.Complete incubation mixture without cyt b50.5 ± 0.0240 ± 2Complete incubation mixture without cyt b5 reductaseNDaND, not detectable (below the limit of detection); limit of detection = 17 nmol/min/mg of fraction A.NDcND, not detectable (below the limit of detection); limit of detection = 1 nmol/min/mg protein of fraction A and cyt b5.Complete incubation mixture without fraction A2.1 ± 0.4Only fraction ANDaND, not detectable (below the limit of detection); limit of detection = 17 nmol/min/mg of fraction A.a ND, not detectable (below the limit of detection); limit of detection = 17 nmol/min/mg of fraction A.b ND, not detectable (below the limit of detection); limit of detection = 1 nmol/min/mg of total protein.c ND, not detectable (below the limit of detection); limit of detection = 1 nmol/min/mg protein of fraction A and cyt b5. Open table in a new tab The specific activity of fraction B in the reconstituted system was slightly lower than the specific activity of fraction A (7.10 ± 0.08 μmol of benzamidine/min/mg (n = 4)). However, in contrast to fraction A, fraction B also reduced benzamidoxime without adding cyt b5 and its reductase with a specific activity of 30 ± 1 nmol of benzamidine/min/mg (n = 4), demonstrating that it is contaminated with cyt b5 and its reductase. Composition of Fraction A—SDS-PAGE analysis of fraction A showed an almost electrophoretically pure protein with two dominant spots (35 and 66 kDa) in a Coomassie-stained SDS gel (Fig. 3B). Whereas the 66-kDa protein was identified as monoamine oxidase-B by MALDI-TOF, tryptic digestion and electrospray ionization-MS/MS sequencing of the 35-kDa spot led to identification of four peptides, LWIYPVK, TEAYR, CILTTVDPDTGVIDRK, and VGDPVYR, which all displayed 100% identity to a putative protein from Homo sapiens hitherto referred to as “Moco sulfurase C-terminal domain-containing protein 2” (protein accession entry NP_060368). This result was confirmed by identifying the peptides LWIYPVKSCK, CILTTVDPDTGVIDRK, and VGDPVYRMV in a second independent experiment. Sequence comparisons showed that the protein identified shares 48% homology with the C-terminal domain of HMCS, which catalyzes the post-translational activation of the Moco-containing enzymes xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase (30Ichida K. Matsumura T. Sakuma R. Hosoya T. Nishino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against the heterologously expressed C-terminal domain of the Moco sulfurase ABA3 from A. thaliana, the plant counterpart of HMCS (31Bittner F. Oreb M. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40381-40384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), showed specific cross-reaction with the C-terminal domain of HMCS (HMCS-CT) (Fig. 4A). Also in fractions A and B from the outer membrane of pig liver mitochondria, the antibody specifically recognized the 35-kDa protein (Fig. 4B), which gives evidence for structural relation of the 35-kDa protein and the C termini of HMCS and ABA3. The upper band in Fig. 4B may derive from the 35-kDa protein with post-translational modifications, wh"

The association between ectopic activation of Wnt signaling and many different types of human cancer suggests that Wnt ligands can initiate tumor formation through altered regulation of stem cell populations. Here we have shown that mice deficient for the Wnt co-receptor Lrp5 are resistant to Wnt1-induced mammary tumors, which have been shown to be derived from the mammary stem/progenitor cell population. These mice exhibit a profound delay in tumorigenesis that is associated with reduced Wnt1-induced accumulation of mammary progenitor cells. In addition to the tumor resistance phenotype, loss of Lrp5 delays normal mammary development. The ductal trees of 5-week-old Lrp5-/- females have fewer terminal end buds, which are structures critical for juvenile ductal extension presumed to be rich in stem/progenitor cells. Consequently, the mature ductal tree is hypomorphic and does not completely fill the fat pad. Furthermore, Lrp5-/- ductal cells from mature females exhibit little to no stem cell activity in limiting dilution transplants. Finally, we have shown that Lrp5-/- embryos exhibit substantially impaired canonical Wnt signaling in the primitive stem cell compartment of the mammary placodes. These findings suggest that Lrp5-mediated canonical signaling is required for mammary ductal stem cell activity and for tumor development in response to oncogenic Wnt effectors.

Signaling by the Wnt family of secreted lipoproteins plays a central role in development and disease (1Nusse R. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, Wnt proteins regulate a broad range of functions, including the self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells (2Reya T. Duncan A.W. Ailles L. Domen J. Scherer D.C. Willert K. Hintz L. Nusse R. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). Activation of the canonical Wnt cascade is initiated by the binding of Wnt proteins to cell surface receptors composed of a member of the Frizzled protein family and one of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins, LRP5 3The abbreviations used are: Lrp5, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5; TEB, terminal end bud; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; MMTV, murine mammary tumor virus. or LRP6 (3Sharpe C.

Signaling from Wnt receptors increases cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin, which binds to transcription factors such as those of the LEF-1/TCF family and modulates the transcription of specific target genes. Whereas Wnt-Frizzled interactions may also be involved in non-canonical Wnt signaling events, the LRP5/6 moiety appears to be specifically required for the canonical pathway (5Liu G. Bafico A. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Studies in mice suggest that canonical Wnt signaling plays a significant role during normal mammary gland development (6Andl T. Reddy S.T. Gaddapara T. Millar S.E. Dev.

Thiery J.P. Bellusci S. Differentiation. 2003; 71: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In response to signals from the underlying mesenchyme, the mammary lines give rise to five pairs of lens-shaped mammary placodes that grow and invaginate downwards into the dermis to colonize the rudimentary fat pad. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway along the mammary lines coincides with the initiation of mammary morphogenesis and subsequently localizes to mammary placodes and buds (13Chu E.Y. Hens J. Andl T. Kairo A. Yamaguchi T.P. Brisken C. Glick A. Wysolmerski J.J. Millar S.E. Development. 2004; 131: 4819-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14Boras-Granic K. Chang H. Grosschedl R. Hamel P.A. Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Several Wnt ligands and receptor genes, including Lrp5, are expressed during embryonic mammary morphogenesis (13Chu E.Y. Hens J. Andl T. Kairo A. Yamaguchi T.P. Brisken C. Glick A. Wysolmerski J.J. Millar S.E. Development. 2004; 131: 4819-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Embryos ectopically expressing the canonical Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 display a complete block in the formation of mammary placodes, and mice deficient for Lef-1 fail to maintain their mammary buds (6Andl T. Reddy S.T. Gaddapara T. Millar S.E. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 643-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 7van Genderen C. Okamura R.M. Farinas I. Quo R.G. Parslow T.G. Bruhn L. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2691-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), showing that Wnt signals are necessary for embryonic mammary development. By birth, the mammary gland is composed of a few rudimentary ducts, containing an outer layer of myoepithelial and an inner layer of luminal epithelial cells, surrounded by the fat pad. During pre-pubertal and pubertal development, the ductal epithelium proliferates until the fat pad is fully colonized with a sparse ductal tree. Lobuloalveolar precursor cells respond to endocrine signals during pregnancy to colonize all the interductal spaces, increasing cell number at least 10-fold (15Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The expansion of mammary epithelium during juvenile growth, estrous, and pregnancy, together with the remarkable regenerative capacity apparent during successive reproductive cycles, imply the existence of a mammary stem cell. In fact, stem-like cells from mature mammary glands have been isolated, and their ability to reconstitute the different epithelial lineages in vitro and functional ductal trees through limiting dilution transplants in vivo has been demonstrated (16Stingl J.

However, the signals that regulate mammary stem cells have yet not been defined. A connection between mammary stem/progenitor cells and Wnt1- or β-catenin-induced tumorigenesis has recently been established. Transgenic expression of these genes results in widespread mammary hyperplasia and rapid tumor formation (11Imbert A. Eelkema R. Jordan S. Feiner H. Cowin P. J.

The hyperplastic tissue contains an increased fraction of mammary stem/progenitor cells that are thought to directly give rise to transformed cells (17Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J.

In MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mice loss of Lrp5 markedly reduces both the early proliferation of the progenitor cell population and the subsequent formation of mammary tumors. Furthermore, Lrp5-/- mammary cells are unable to reconstitute ductal trees through limiting dilution transplants. Taken together, these results suggest that canonical signaling through the Lrp5 receptor is critical for mammary stem cell activity. Mouse Crosses—The Lrp5-/- mice (22Holmen S.L. Giambernardi T.A.

PCR-based strategies were then used to genotype these mice (details available upon request). All experiments performed were in compliance with the guiding principles of the “Care and Use of Animals” available at www.nap.edu/books/0309053773/html and were approved in advance by the Van Andel Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To assay the appearance of mammary tumors, the mice were inspected weekly and were euthanized when tumors appeared. Immunohistochemistry and Western Blotting—Mammary tissues were fixed for 2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and then embedded in paraffin and sectioned (5 μm). Immunohistochemistry was performed by using Vector ABC and DAB kits according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Vector Laboratories). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antibody against keratin 6 (1:100; Covance), Lrp5 (1:5,000; kindly provided by John Robinson (24Babij P. Zhao W. Small C. Kharode Y. Yaworsky P.J. Bouxsein M.L. Reddy P.S. Bodine P.V. Robinson J.A. Bhat B. Marzolf J. Moran R.A. Bex F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 960-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar)), Lrp6 (1:250; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and p21CIP1 (1:250; Santa Cruz). Western blotting using goat polyclonal antibodies against Wnt1 (1:500; Santa Cruz) was performed as previously described (19Li Y. Welm B. Podsypanina K. Huang S. Chamorro M. Zhang X. Rowlands T. Egeblad M. Cowin P. Werb Z. Tan L.K. Rosen J.M. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15853-15858Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Mammary Whole Mounts and Analysis of BAT-Gal Expression—Inguinal mammary glands were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with carmine alum, dehydrated, and cleared in xylene. For analysis of BAT-gal expression whole mount embryos were fixed (0.2% glutaraldehyde, 1.5% formaldehyde, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline) and stained with X-gal (1 mg/ml X-gal, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm Fe3(CN)6, 5 mm Fe4(CN)6 in phosphate-buffered saline), photographed and paraffin-embedded, sectioned (5 μm), and counterstained with eosin. Embryonic stage was confirmed by analysis of limb morphology. Preparation of Mammary Epithelial Cells—Mammary epithelial cells were isolated as described (16Stingl J. Eirew P. Ricketson I. Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Choi D. Li H.I. Eaves C.J. Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Briefly, mammary glands were digested for 8 h at 37°C in EpiCult-B with 5% fetal bovine serum, 300 units/ml collagenase, and 100 units/ml hyaluronidase. After vortexing and lysis of the red blood cells in NH4Cl, a single-cell suspension was obtained by sequential dissociation of the fragments by gentle pipetting for 1-2 min in 0.25% trypsin and then for 2 min in 5 mg/ml Dispase II plus 0.1 mg/ml DNase I, followed by filtration through a 40-mm mesh. All reagents were from StemCell Technologies Inc. Transplantation of Cleared Mammary Fat Pads—Mammary glands of 3-week-old female B6 mice were cleared of endogenous epithelium as previously described (25Kordon E.C. Smith G.H. Development. 1998; 125: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viable mammary epithelial cells from 2- to 3-month-old Lrp5+/+ or Lrp5-/- virgin female B6 mice were counted and suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 2% fetal bovine serum with 5 μg/ml Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at 4 °C together with loading dye (final concentration, 5% glycerol/0.5% trypan blue/25 mm HEPES), and inoculated in a 1-μl volume containing 500-50,000 cells/μl. Three to five months after transplantation, the fat pads were dissected, processed, and stained with carmine as described above. Lrp5 Deficiency Inhibits MMTV-Wnt1-induced Carcinogenesis—Female mice expressing the Wnt1 gene under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-long terminal repeat enhancer reproducibly develop adenocarcinomas within one year (18Tsukamoto A.S. Grosschedl R. Guzman R.C. Parslow T. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). To test whether Lrp5 is the principal signaling receptor for Wnt ligands in mammary epithelial cells, we crossed Lrp5-/- mice to MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mice. These crosses gave rise to females of approximately the same genetic background that were hemizygous for the Wnt1 transgene in the context of Lrp5+/+, Lrp5+/-, and Lrp5-/- genotypes. Wnt1 transgenic mammary tissue and tumors normally express Lrp5 and Lrp6 (Fig. 1, A-F). The presence or absence of Lrp5 did not affect expression of the Wnt1 transgene (Fig. 1G). We found that within 10 months, 100% of Lrp5+/+ mice developed tumors with a median time of onset of 25 weeks, and 68% of Lrp5+/- mice formed tumors with a median time of onset of 35 weeks (Fig. 1H). Thus, tumor appearance was delayed several weeks in Lrp5+/- mice (p = 3 × 10-5), indicating that the gene dose of Lrp5 affects the onset of tumorigenesis. In sharp contrast, 100% of Lrp5-/- mice were tumor free at 10 months of age (Fig. 1H), demonstrating that absence of Lrp5 suppressed tumor formation. We extended this analysis over two years and found that Lrp5-/- mice formed tumors with a median time of 90 weeks. Three Lrp5-/- mice (12%) failed to develop palpable tumors and were sacrificed at the end of the study (124 weeks old). All mammary glands from these animals exhibited epithelial hyperplasia, but no foci of mammary tumors were found (data not shown). Histopathological examination of the tumors in this study revealed that all Lrp5+/+ and Lrp5+/- tumors, as well as 18/26 Lrp5-/- tumors, were moderately differentiated alveolar mammary adenocarcinomas (Fig. 1, I and J). Alveolar adenocarcinoma is the most common type of mammary tumor reported in Wnt1 transgenic mice. Five Lrp5-/- tumors were papillary adenocarcinomas (Fig. 1K), a morphological variant that is more differentiated and less aggressive than alveolar adenocarcinoma and normally occurs at a low frequency in Wnt1 transgenic mice (26Donehower L.A. Godley L.A. Aldaz C.M. Pyle R. Shi Y.P. Pinkel D. Gray J. Bradley A. Medina D. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 882-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Hence, even though we could only detect the papillary growth pattern in Lrp5-/- tumors, the Lrp5-/- tumors were not of a different tumor type than previously described for Wnt1-induced tumors. Furthermore, all tumors regardless of Lrp5 genotype expressed cell markers from both the myoepithelial and the luminal epithelial cell lineages, and all tumors contained cells positive for the putative mammary progenitor cell marker keratin 6 (19Li Y. Welm B. Podsypanina K. Huang S. Chamorro M. Zhang X. Rowlands T. Egeblad M. Cowin P. Werb Z. Tan L.K. Rosen J.M. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15853-15858Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1, A-F). Taken together, these findings suggest that the tumor precursor cell is likely the same regardless of Lrp5 genotype. Loss of Lrp5 Delays Wnt1-induced Mammary Hyperplasia— Tumors induced by Wnt effectors ultimately arise within a context of widespread mammary hyperplasia that is noticeable as early in development as embryonic day 18 (18Tsukamoto A.S. Grosschedl R. Guzman R.C. Parslow T. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of Lrp5 to Wnt1-induced mammary gland hyperplasia, ductal development was analyzed in virgin MMTV-Wnt1;Lrp5-/- mice. Inguinal mammary glands were isolated, whole mounted, and compared in the juvenile (5-week) and mature (3 and 15-month) mammary glands from MMTV-Wnt1;Lrp5-/- and control female mice. In the absence of Lrp5, we found that the hyperplastic response to Wnt1 was dramatically delayed (Fig. 2A). Morphometric analysis showed that hyperplasia was inhibited by 80% in mammary glands from Lrp5-/- mice relative to Lrp5+/+ matched controls (p = 6.5 × 10-6) (Fig. 2B). The hyperplastic mammary tissue of Wnt1 transgenic mice contains an increased ratio of mammary progenitor cells (17Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 19Li Y. Welm B. Podsypanina K. Huang S. Chamorro M. Zhang X. Rowlands T. Egeblad M. Cowin P. Werb Z. Tan L.K. Rosen J.M. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15853-15858Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 20Liu B.Y. McDermott S.P. Khwaja S.S. Alexander C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4158-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These progenitor cells are thought to directly give rise to transformed cells. To test whether the delay in tumorigenesis could be due to a reduced accumulation of mammary progenitor cells, we immunostained mammary sections from MMTV-Wnt1;Lrp5-/- and control female mice using keratin 6 antibody. We found that Wnt1 transgenic mammary ducts from Lrp5-/- females contained less than half the number of keratin 6-positive cells detected in littermate controls (Fig. 2, C and D). This was further confirmed by staining for another putative mammary progenitor cell marker, p21CIP1 (27Clarke R.B. Spence K. Anderson E. Howell A. Okano H. Potten C.S. Dev. Biol. 2005; 277: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which also showed a significant reduction of positive cells in Lrp5- ducts (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these findings suggest that Lrp5 deficiency reduces the normal accumulation of mammary progenitor cells in MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mice. Impaired Mammary Gland Development in Lrp5-/- Mice—To determine the contribution of Lrp5 to normal mammary gland function, ductal development was analyzed in virgin Lrp5-/- mice. Whole mount preparations of inguinal mammary glands are shown for juvenile (5-week) and mature (11-week) mammary glands from Lrp5-/- and control female littermates (Fig. 3A). At 5 weeks the ductal network extends away from the nipple through the fat pad, past the lymph node. The mammary ducts of Lrp5-/- mice were clearly shorter than those of littermate controls. Whereas the Lrp5-/- ductal tree ended right around the lymph node, the wild type had extended considerably further. Terminal end buds (TEBs) are club-shaped epithelial thickenings at the distal ends of growing ducts and are the sites of most rapid cell proliferation and ductal elongation. TEBs are presumed to be rich in mammary stem cells (28Kenney N.J. Smith G.H. Lawrence E. Barrett J.C. Salomon D.S. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2001; 1: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Williams J.M. Daniel C.W. Dev. Biol. 1983; 97: 274-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We found that the number of TEBs was reduced by 42% in juvenile Lrp5-/- mice compared with littermate wild-type mice (p = 0.0003) (Fig. 3B). In both control and Lrp5-/- mice, the histology of the TEBs appeared normal (data not shown). The branching complexity in adult mice is a function of terminal end bud activity during juvenile ductal extension. TEBs normally disappear when the ductal tree is fully branched and fills the fat pad. In contrast, the ductal tree of adult Lrp5-/- mice still contained TEBs and did not completely fill the mammary fat pad (Fig. 3A). Morphometric analysis showed that the branching complexity of adult Lrp5-/- glands was decreased by 46% compared with littermate wild-type mice (p = 0.001) (Fig. 3C). On the histological level, the adult Lrp5-/- mammary glands looked normal except for the reduction of mammary ducts as seen on whole mounts (data not shown). Epithelial Transplants from Lrp5-/- Mice Lack Stem Cell Activity—The outgrowth of a full mammary branching tree from limiting dilutions of mammary epithelial cell transplants is considered to be an assay of clonal stem cell function (25Kordon E.C. Smith G.H. Development. 1998; 125: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surgical removal of the area between the nipple and the fat pad at 3 weeks of age leaves a fat pad free of the endogenous mammary epithelium. Mammary cells from another syngenic animal can be implanted and will develop an epithelial tree if the transplant contains cells with stem cell activity. One benefit of this technique is that the transplanted cells are exposed to normal circulating hormone levels and wild-type stroma. To test whether the reduction in terminal end bud numbers and branching complexity of Lrp5-/- mammary glands could be due to compromised mammary stem cell activity, we transferred cells from 12- to 15-week-old Lrp5-/- and wild-type glands by limiting dilutions (500-50,000) into cleared fat pads of 3-week-old congenic or isogenic recipients. Transplants were harvested after 3-5 months, and whole mounts were prepared to evaluate the extent of epithelial outgrowth. Half and 32% of host glands were colonized after the transfer of 5,000 and 500 wild-type mammary cells, respectively (Fig. 4A). Only one of 46 fat pads hosting Lrp5-/- mammary cells contained a mammary tree (Fig. 4A); an additional three host glands contained an epithelial rudiment (data not shown). In fact, transfers of 50,000 Lrp5-/- mammary cells still failed to reconstitute a mammary tree (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting a loss of stem cell activity in the context of Lrp5 deficiency. Canonical Wnt Signaling Is Compromised in Lrp5-/- Mammary Placodes—Mammary development begins at E10.5, and by birth a primitive ductal tree has formed. The stem cells required for its extension during puberty are already present at birth. To test whether Lrp5 is the principal signaling receptor for Wnt ligands during embryonic mammary development, we crossed Lrp5-/- mice to transgenic mice carrying a BAT-gal lacZ reporter gene that is expressed at sites of canonical pathway activity (23Maretto S. Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Braghetta P. Broccoli V. Hassan A.B. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Piccolo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3299-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Reporter gene activity, detected by X-gal staining for β-galactosidase, was significantly reduced in Lrp5-/- embryos relative to littermate controls (Fig. 5, A and B). On the histological level the mammary placodes of Lrp5-/- embryos were significantly smaller and contained fewer cells with reporter gene activity (Fig. 5, C and D). We also performed X-gal staining on mammary whole mounts from newborn, juvenile, and adult virgin females. Reporter gene activity was significantly reduced in the ductal tree of 2-day-old Lrp5-/- female mice relative to littermate controls (Fig. 5, E and F). BAT-gal expression could not be detected after the first week of life (data not shown), which is consistent with previous reports (13Chu E.Y. Hens J. Andl T. Kairo A. Yamaguchi T.P. Brisken C. Glick A. Wysolmerski J.J. Millar S.E. Development. 2004; 131: 4819-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14Boras-Granic K. Chang H. Grosschedl R. Hamel P.A. Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a requirement for the Wnt co-receptor Lrp5 in mammary morphogenesis and tumor formation mediated by ductal stem cells. Importantly, Lrp5-/- mice are resistant to Wnt1-induced tumors, which have been shown to be derived from the mammary stem/progenitor cell population (Fig. 1). These mice exhibit a profound delay in tumorigenesis that is associated with reduced Wnt1-induced hyperplasia and reduced accumulation of mammary progenitor cells (Fig. 2). In addition to the tumor resistance phenotype, loss of Lrp5 impairs various stem cell activities required for normal mammary development (Fig. 3), and Lrp5-/- ductal cells exhibit little to no stem cell activity in limiting dilution transplants (Fig. 4). Lrp5-/- embryos also exhibit substantially impaired canonical Wnt signaling in the primitive stem cell compartment of the mammary placode (Fig. 5). Lrp5-/- mice still express Lrp6 throughout mammary development, 4C. Lindvall, unpublished data. and the Wnt1-induced tumors that finally do arise in Lrp5-/- mice also express Lrp6 (Fig. 1). Therefore, Lrp6 may mediate the residual canonical signaling seen in the absence of Lrp5, but clearly Lrp6 cannot compensate for the loss of Lrp5 in tumor initiation or development. Non-canonical Wnt signaling or mTOR signaling directly induced by Wnt ligands may also play a role in Wnt1-induced tumorigenesis and contribute to tumor development in Lrp5-/- mice (30Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 31Inoki K. Ouyang H. Zhu T. Lindvall C. Wang Y. Zhang X. Yang Q. Bennett C.

These findings have important implications for the characterization of mammary stem cells and tumors induced by Wnt effectors. Canonical Wnt signaling has been implicated in the regulation of various stem cells, including hematopoietic, intestinal, and epidermal stem cells (32Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (3046) Google Scholar). For example, soluble Wnt proteins promote growth and inhibit differentiation in hematopoietic stem cells (2Reya T. Duncan A.W. Ailles L. Domen J. Scherer D.C. Willert K. Hintz L. Nusse R. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling also inhibits the differentiation of stem cells in the intestinal epithelium and in hair follicles (33Korinek V. Barker N. Moerer P. van Donselaar E. Huls G. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 34Huelsken J. Vogel R. Erdmann B. Cotsarelis G. Birchmeier W. Cell. 2001; 105: 533-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Importantly, in many of the same tissues where the Wnt pathway controls stem cells, deregulation of Wnt signaling leads to tumor formation. Stabilization of β-catenin in the intestinal epithelium or overexpression of β-catenin in the epidermis results in the development of intestinal adenomas or hair tumors, respectively (35Dietrich W.F. Lander E.S. Smith J.S. Moser A.R. Gould K.A. Luongo C. Borenstein N. Dove W. Cell. 1993; 75: 631-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 36Gat U. DasGupta R. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Cell. 1998; 95: 605-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). This suggests that Wnt ligands can initiate tumor formation through altered regulation of stem cell populations. Consistently, mice that overexpress Wnt signaling effectors in the mammary epithelium develop tumors with stem/progenitor cell properties, in contrast to mice overexpressing several other oncogenes (19Li Y. Welm B. Podsypanina K. Huang S. Chamorro M. Zhang X. Rowlands T. Egeblad M. Cowin P. Werb Z. Tan L.K. Rosen J.M. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15853-15858Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The pre-neoplastic hyperplasia contains an increased fraction of cells positive for molecular markers that have been associated with mammary progenitor cells, and the likelihood of progression to carcinoma correlates with the overall number of progenitor cells (17Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 19Li Y. Welm B. Podsypanina K. Huang S. Chamorro M. Zhang X. Rowlands T. Egeblad M. Cowin P. Werb Z. Tan L.K. Rosen J.M. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15853-15858Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 20Liu B.Y. McDermott S.P. Khwaja S.S. Alexander C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4158-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In addition, mammary ductal cells from pre-neoplastic Wnt1 transgenic mice show an increased frequency of cells with stem cell activity, measured by transferring limiting dilutions of cells to fat pads in vivo (17Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 20Liu B.Y. McDermott S.P. Khwaja S.S. Alexander C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4158-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This finding again demonstrates the ability of the Wnt pathway to target stem/progenitor cells for transformation, possibly reflecting a role of the Wnt pathway in the self-renewal of normal breast epithelium. We have shown for the first time that loss of Lrp5-mediated canonical Wnt signaling impairs the mammary stem cell compartment. During normal development, the ductal tree fills the mammary fat pad by the end of puberty and TEBs disappear. In the absence of Lrp5, juvenile ductal branching and extension is supported by fewer TEBs and is significantly delayed. TEBs persist several weeks after they disappear in control littermate females, and the ductal tree never fills the fat pad, even after the TEBs disappear. Lrp5-/- ductal cells are unable to reconstitute ductal trees even when transplanted in large numbers (50,000 ductal cells). Shackleton et al. (17Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar) recently showed that a functional mammary gland could be generated from the transplantation of one ductal stem cell. They estimated the fraction of ductal stem cells in the mature mammary gland to be 1/1,400. Thus we conclude that the mammary glands from adult Lrp5-/- females lack functioning somatic stem cells. There are various ways to explain why Lrp5-/- mammary glands are relatively normal but contain no or very few stem cells: 1) fewer primitive mammary stem cells develop leading to very low stem cell fractions in the adult mammary gland; 2) the proportion of stem cells dividing by self-renewal (and symmetric division) is decreased, leading to progenitor-based organogenesis (either because the stem cell niche is ineffective or the cells differentiate precociously); or 3) canonical Wnt signaling is required for stem/progenitor cell survival (37Paguirigan A. Beebe D.J. Liu B. Alexander C. Eur. J. Cancer. 2006; 42: 1225-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have no data to support or refute the second and third proposals, but in support of the first proposal our analysis of Wnt reporter mice shows that Lrp5-/- embryos develop abnormally small mammary placodes with significantly reduced canonical signaling relative to littermate controls. Previous literature on Wnt reporter mice has shown that canonical Wnt signaling is specifically active during embryonic mammary development (13Chu E.Y. Hens J. Andl T. Kairo A. Yamaguchi T.P. Brisken C. Glick A. Wysolmerski J.J. Millar S.E. Development. 2004; 131: 4819-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14Boras-Granic K. Chang H. Grosschedl R. Hamel P.A. Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Wnt signaling is absolutely required, because mammary placodes fail to develop in transgenic mice overexpressing the Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 (6Andl T. Reddy S.T. Gaddapara T. Millar S.E. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 643-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Dkk1 inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway by binding to, and presumably inactivating, Lrp5 and Lrp6. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that specific subtypes of the most common human tumors, including breast (38Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (8512) Google Scholar), lung (39Kim C.F. Jackson E.L. Woolfenden A.E. Lawrence S. Babar I. Vogel S. Crowley D. Bronson R.T.

Science. 2005; 307: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), originate in stem cell compartments. Signaling pathways that regulate stem cell activity could therefore be effective drug targets. In fact, several studies have shown that activation of canonical Wnt signaling is common in human breast cancer (41Lin S.Y. Xia W. Wang J.C. Kwong K.Y. Spohn B. Wen Y. Pestell R.G. Hung M.C. Proc.

Simon R. Sauter G. Leibiger H. Essers L. Weber B. Hermann K. Rosenthal A. Hartmann A. Dahl E. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 25: 641-649PubMed Google Scholar). We show that in the absence of Lrp5, the response to ectopically expressed Wnt1 in the mammary epithelium is almost eliminated (Fig. 2), as is tumor development (Fig. 1). The few mammary tumors that arise in Lrp5-/- mice exhibit histology and differentiation markers similar to those of Lrp5-expressing tumors (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that Lrp5-/- tumors also originate from the mammary progenitor cell population. The delay in tumorigenesis could thus be explained by a reduction in the number of transformable progenitor cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Lrp5 receptor may be a highly effective target for inhibiting oncogenic canonical Wnt signaling in human malignancies.

https://openalex.org/W2127236494,"Despite rapid advances in the field of DNA repair, little is known about the repair of protein-DNA adducts. Previous studies have demonstrated that topoisomerase II (TopII)-DNA adducts (TopII-DNA covalent complexes) are rapidly degraded by the proteasome. It has been hypothesized that proteasomal degradation of TopII-DNA covalent adducts exposes TopII-concealed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) for repair. To test this hypothesis, the anticancer drug, VP-16 (etoposide), was employed to induce TopII-DNA covalent complexes in mammalian cells, and the involvement of proteasome in processing TopII-DNA covalent complexes into DSBs was investigated. Consistent with the hypothesis, VP-16-induced DSBs as monitored by neutral comet assay, as well as DNA damage signals (e.g. γ-H2AX) were significantly reduced in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Using both top2β knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts and Top2β small interfering RNA knockdown PC12 cells, as well as postmitotic neurons in which TopIIα was absent, we showed that VP-16-induced DNA damage signals were attenuated upon proteasome inhibition, suggesting the involvement of proteasome in the repair/processing of both TopIIα-DNA and TopIIβ-DNA adducts. By contrast, hydrogen peroxide-induced γ-H2AX was unaffected upon proteasome inhibition, suggesting a specific requirement of the proteasome pathway in the processing of TopII-DNA covalent complexes into DNA damage. Despite rapid advances in the field of DNA repair, little is known about the repair of protein-DNA adducts.

Frank A.J. Padget K. Tilby M.J. Austin C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), is widely used as a DNA damaging agent that induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (2Baldwin E.L. Osheroff N. Curr. Med. Chem. Anticancer Agents. 2005; 5: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism by which TopII-DNA covalent complexes are transformed into DSBs. In vitro, the VP-16-stabilized TopII-DNA covalent complex presumably reflects the key covalent reaction intermediate, the reversible TopII cleavage complex in which each TopII subunit is covalently linked to the 5′-phosphoryl ends of the four-base staggered DSBs (3Chen G.L.

In vivo, VP-16, as well as other TopII poisons, is known to induce DNA damage signals indicative of chromosomal DNA damage. For example, TopII poisons are known to cause G2 cell cycle arrest (4Clifford B. Beljin M. Stark G.R. Taylor W.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4074-4081PubMed Google Scholar), elevation of sister chromatid exchanges (5Pommier Y. Kerrigan D. Covey J.M. Kao-Shan C.S. Whang-Peng J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16547-16552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, how TopII-concealed DSBs are converted into DNA damage that is recognizable by the DNA damage repair system is not clear. A previous study has shown that TopII poisons induce proteasome-mediated degradation of TopII, a process referred to as TopII down-regulation (12Mao Y. Desai S.D. Ting C.Y. Hwang J. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40652-40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). TopII down-regulation was shown to be transcription-dependent and exhibits a preference for the TopIIβ isozyme. This phenomenon of proteasome-dependent degradation of TopII is highly reminiscent of proteasome-dependent degradation of topoisomerase I (TopI) induced by the TopI poison, camptothecin (13Desai S.D. Li T.K. Rodriguez-Bauman A. Rubin E.H. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5926-5932PubMed Google Scholar, 14Desai S.D. Zhang H. Rodriguez-Bauman A. Yang J.M. Wu X. Gounder M.K. Rubin E.H. Liu L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2341-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that, similar to TopI cleavage complexes, TopII cleavage complexes are degraded by the proteasome to reveal topoisomerase-concealed DNA strand breaks for repair (12Mao Y. Desai S.D. Ting C.Y. Hwang J. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40652-40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that proteasome degradation of TopII cleavage complexes transforms TopII-concealed strand breaks into DSBs that are recognizable by the DNA damage signaling pathways. Materials—4,4-(2,3-Butanediyl)-bis(2,6-piperazinedione) (ICRF-193) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals. Etoposide (VP-16), carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132), cycloheximide (CHX), 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-β-d-ribofuranoside (DRB), aphidicolin, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole were purchased from Sigma.

The anti-TopIIα and TopIIβ antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechonology, Inc. Isolation of top2β+/- and top2β-/- Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)—Embryonic day-12.5 (E12.5) mouse embryos (top2β+/- and top2β-/- (15Lyu Y.L. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7123-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)) were dissected free of brains and livers, finely minced, and then suspended in trypsin-EDTA. The cell suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by termination with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The single cell suspensions were centrifuged to obtain cell pellets which were then re-suspended in fresh culture medium and plated in culture dishes. MEFs were then transformed with SV40 large T-antigen by co-transfection a SV40 T-antigen plasmid (pAN2) and a neor plasmid (at a ratio of 4:1). 48 h post-transfection, cells were selected with G418 (500 μg/ml) for 10 to 15 days. Transformed cells were then cloned. Comet Assay—Wild type transformed MEFs were pretreated with 2 μm MG132 for 30 min, followed by co-treatment with 250 μm VP-16 for 1.5 h. Cells were then washed three times with fresh medium (with or without 2 μm MG132 as indicated) and incubated for additional 30 min (for reversal of topoisomerase II cleavage complexes). For comet assay, treated cells were scraped from plates and pelletted, followed by re-suspension in 1× PBS (10,000 cells/ml). 50 μl of the cell suspension was then mixed with 500 μl 0.5% low melting point agarose at 37 °C. 75 μl of the cell/agarose mixture was transferred onto glass slides. Slides were then immersed in prechilled lysis buffer (2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 10.0, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% Me2SO) for 1 h, followed by equilibration in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer for 30 min. Slides were electrophoresed in 1× Tris borate-EDTA at 1.5 volt/cm for 5 min and stained with Vistra Green (Amersham Biosciences). Images were visualized under a fluorescence microscope and captured with a CCD camera. The comet tail moment was determined using the Comet Assay IV software (Perceptive Instruments), and the mean ± S.E. of the comet tail moment was obtained from ∼50 cells for each treatment group. Statistical analysis of the mean comet tail moments was performed using Student's t test. TopIIβ Knockdown by Small Interfering RNA in PC12 Cells— Based on the 643-bp partial rat TopIIβ cDNA sequence reported in the data base (GenBank™ accession number D14046), which corresponds to the N-terminal domain of the protein, the sequence 5′-GCCCCCGTTATATCTTCAC-3′ was selected for shRNA-mediated knockdown of rat TopIIβ. The duplex DNA (5′-TGCCCCCGTTATATCTTCACTTCAAGAGAGTGAAGATATAACGGGGGCTTTTTC-3′) was made and cloned into the LentiLox 3.7 vector (obtained from Dr. Van Parijs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). The Top2β shRNA LentiLox 3.7 DNA was then mixed with the ViralPower™ Packaging Mix (containing pLP1, pLP2, and pLP/VSVG DNAs, which provide necessary proteins for virus production) and used for transfection into 293T cells with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) to generate the lentiviral stock. Cultured PC12 cells were infected with rat Top2β shRNA lentivirus. Single colonies were isolated and characterized. The PC12-I4 clone was shown to express reduced levels of Top2β mRNA and TopIIβ protein. The PC12-C4 clone was isolated from control lentivirus (vector only)-infected PC12 cells. Neuronal Cultures—Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) were isolated as described by Levi et al. (16Levi G. Aloisi F. Ciotti M.T. Gallo V. Brain Res. 1984; 290: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) from postnatal day-8 (P8) Sprague-Dawley rats. Briefly, cerebella were isolated free of meninges and blood vessels in basal medium Eagle buffered with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Cerebella were then minced and incubated in 0.08% trypsin/basal medium Eagle-HEPES for 15 min at 37 °C. DNase I (0.05%) plus the soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.025%) were then added to halt trypsinization. The cell suspension was triturated using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette, followed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively), followed by passing through a 40-μm nylon filter (Sefar America, Inc.). All culture dishes and glass coverslips were precoated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine. Cortical neurons (CNs) were isolated from E17.5 mouse embryos following the same procedure as described above. Immunocytochemistry—For immunocytochemistry, CGNs or CNs (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were plated onto glass coverslips in a 24-well plate and cultured. Neuron cells cultured for 2 day in vitro (2 DIV), were treated with VP-16 or camptothecin for 1 h followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 10 min. Fixed neurons were rinsed once with PBS and then incubated with PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium azide for 30 min at room temperature. For antibody staining, neurons were incubated with anti-ATM-S1981-P (1 to 500 dilution) or anti-γ-H2AX(1 to 200 dilution) antibody in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium azide overnight at 4 °C. After several rinses with PBS, neurons were incubated with appropriate secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno-Research). Neurons on glass coverslips were then washed with PBS followed by counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole. The glass coverslips were mounted with an aqueous mounting medium (Gel/Mount) (Biomeda Corporation). Fluorescence images were captured using a CCD camera mounted on a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (17Zhou N. Xiao H. Li T.K. Nur E.K.A. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29532-29537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein samples in SDS gel sample buffer were boiled for 10 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were immersed in 5% milk for 1 h, followed by incubation with specific antibody overnight. Membranes were then washed with TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h. Bound secondary antibody was detected by either x-ray films or the Kodak Image Station 2000R (for quantification) using ECL reagents (Pierce). VP-16 Induces Proteasome-dependent Degradation of TopII and DNA Damage—Previous studies have demonstrated that TopII poisons induce proteasome-mediated degradation of TopII in mammalian cells (12Mao Y. Desai S.D. Ting C.Y. Hwang J. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40652-40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1A, VP-16 induced a time-dependent degradation of TopIIβ (also TopIIα, but to a lesser extent) in transformed MEFs. Consistent with results obtained from previous studies, degradation of TopIIβ was largely prevented by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (2 μm) (Fig. 1A), suggesting the involvement of proteasome in TopIIβ down-regulation. It has been proposed that proteasomal degradation of TopII cleavage complexes represents a novel repair pathway, which processes TopII-DNA covalent complexes into reparable DSBs (12Mao Y. Desai S.D. Ting C.Y. Hwang J. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40652-40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we measured the amount of DSBs in VP-16-treated MEFs using neutral comet assay in the presence and absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, VP-16 (250 μm for 1.5 h) treatment induced a statistically significant increase in average comet tail moment compared with Me2SO (0.25%, solvent control) treatment (1.9-fold, p value < 0.001, t test), suggesting induction of DSBs by VP-16. Co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 largely abolished this VP-16 signal (p value < 0.001, t test), suggesting the involvement of the proteasome in the induction of DSBs by VP-16. In these experiments, the comet signal most likely reflected the formation of frank DSBs rather than TopII cleavage complexes, since a cleavage complex reversing procedure (incubation in fresh medium without VP-16) was applied prior to the comet assay. We also measured the appearance of Ser-139 phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX) which served as a marker for DSBs (18Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 617-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, γ-H2AX was induced by VP-16 treatment in MEFs as revealed by immunoblotting with anti-γ-H2AX antibody, suggesting the presence of DSBs in VP-16-treated MEFs. As expected, the appearance of VP-16-induced γ-H2AX was significantly reduced by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, consistent with the proposed role of proteasome in processing TopII-DNA covalent complexes into DSBs. Involvement of Proteasome in the Processing of TopIIα-DNA Covalent Complex into DNA Damage—VP-16 is known to induce both TopIIα-DNA and TopIIβ-DNA covalent complexes indiscriminately (1Willmore E. Frank A.J. Padget K. Tilby M.J. Austin C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The DSBs induced by VP-16 could be due to the processing of either or both covalent complexes in transformed MEFs. To determine the role of the two TopII isozymes in the induction of DSBs by VP-16, γ-H2AX was measured in TopIIβ knockdown PC12 cells (PC12-I4) and the control PC12 cells (PC12-C4) treated with VP-16. As shown in Fig. 2A, VP-16 induced a similar level of γ-H2AX in PC12-C4 as compared with that in PC12-I4 cells, suggesting that the γ-H2AX signal is primarily due to the presence of TopIIα-DNA covalent complexes. This conclusion was further supported by studies in top2β knock-out MEFs. As shown in Fig. 2B, VP-16 induced a similar level of γ-H2AX in top2β-/- MEFs as compared with that in top2β+/- MEFs. Furthermore, the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, reduced the VP-induced γ-H2AX signal by about 40% (in both top2β+/- and top2β-/- MEFs treated with 100 μm VP-16), suggesting that the proteasome is involved in the processing of TopIIα-DNA covalent complexes into DSBs. Involvement of Proteasome in the Processing of TopIIβ-DNA Covalent Complex into DNA Damage—To determine whether TopIIβ-DNA covalent complexes can also be processed by proteasome into DSBs, CGNs were used for our studies. As shown in Fig. 3A, in vitro culturing of CGNs on poly-l-lysine plates induced neuronal differentiation as evidenced by neurite out-growth (data not shown) and a rapid decline of TopIIα levels. After culturing for 1 day in vitro (1 DIV), the TopIIα level in CGNs decreased to a non-detectable level (Fig. 3A). In these post-mitotic CGNs (2 DIV), VP-16 (1-5 h of treatment) was shown to induce degradation of TopIIβ (Fig. 3B). VP-16-induced TopIIβ degradation in postmitotic CGNs was abolished by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Fig. 3B), suggesting the involvement of the proteasome in degrading TopIIβ cleavage complexes. DRB (150 μm), but not CHX (10 μg/ml), was shown to block TopIIβ degradation, suggesting the involvement of transcription but not new protein synthesis in TopIIβ degradation, consistent with previous findings in HeLa cells (12Mao Y. Desai S.D. Ting C.Y. Hwang J. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40652-40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). VP-16 also induced DNA damage signals such as ATM autophosphorylation (at Ser-1981, ATM-S1981-P) and γ-H2AX in postmitotic CGNs (2 DIV) as revealed by immunoblotting using their respective phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 4). ATM-S1981-P autophosphorylation was abolished by co-treatment with MG132 or DRB but not with CHX (or aphidicolin), suggesting that VP-16-induced DNA damage signals requires the proteasome and transcription but not protein synthesis. Similar results were obtained on the VP-16-induced γ-H2AX signal in postmitotic CGNs. As shown in Fig. 4B, VP-16-induced γ-H2AX in postmitotic CGNs was abolished by co-treatment with ICRF-193 (a TopII catalytic inhibitor known to block the formation of TopII-DNA covalent complexes), DRB and MG132. These results are consistent with the notion that TopIIβ-DNA covalent complexes are degraded by the proteasome in a transcription-dependent manner. In addition, the formation of ATM-S1981-P and γ-H2AX DNA damage foci was also monitored by immunocytochemistry in VP-16-treated postmitotic CGNs (2 DIV) using their respective phospho-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), VP-16 induced both ATM-S1981-P and γ-H2AX foci in CGNs. The merged images of ATM-pS1981 and γ-H2AX foci (Fig. 5C) showed co-localization of both foci. Consistent with our immunoblotting results, the formation of both ATM-S1981-P and γ-H2AX foci was abolished by ICRF-193 and MG132. In addition to MG132, lactacystin (a specific proteasome inhibitor) was also shown to block ATM-S1981-P foci induced by VP16 (Fig. 5A), confirming the involvement of proteasome in the activation of DNA damage signals.FIGURE 5VP-16 induces DNA damage foci in postmitotic neurons. Cultured rat CGNs (2 DIV) were treated with VP-16 (3 μm) in the presence or absence of various inhibitors (75 μm ICRF-193, 2 μm MG132, 10 μm lactacystin). Immunocytochemistry using anti-ATM-S1981-P antibody (A) and anti-γH2AX antibody (B) was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, co-localization of ATM-S1981-P and γ-H2AX foci in postmitotic CGNs. CGNs (2 DIV) cultured on glass coverslips were treated with VP-16 (3μm) for 1 h. CGNs were then fixed and co-stained with anti-ATM-S1981-P (red) and anti-γ-H2AX (green) antibodies. D, mouse E17.5 cortical neurons (2 DIV) were cultured on glass coverslips and treated with 0.1% Me2SO (DMSO) or VP-16 (5 μm) for 1 h. Immunocytochemistry was performed using the anti-γ-H2AX antibody. E, mouse E17.5 cortical neurons (2 DIV) were treated with 20 μm VP-16 for 1 h and then analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-γ-H2AX or α-tubulin antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that VP-16-induced DNA damage signals is due to the formation of TopIIβ covalent complexes, CNs isolated from top2β+/- and top2β-/- embryos were used. As shown in Fig. 5, D and E, VP-16 induced γ-H2AX foci in CNs (2 DIV) isolated from top2β+/- but not top2β-/- mouse embryos. Immunoblotting using anti-γ-H2AX antibody also demonstrated that VP-16-induced γ-H2AX signal was TopIIβ-dependent (Fig. 5E). Together, these results support the notion that TopIIβ-DNA covalent complexes are degraded by the proteasome to generate DNA damage signals. VP-16, but Not Hydrogen Peroxide, Induces Proteasome-dependent Phosphorylation of H2AX in Postmitotic Neurons— The proteasome requirement for the induction of DNA damage signals was further investigated in CNs treated with either VP-16 or H2O2. As shown in Fig. 6A, both VP-16 and H2O2 induced γ-H2AX, indicative of the presence of DSBs in treated CNs. However, MG132 specifically abolished γ-H2AX induced by VP-16, but not by H2O2, suggesting that TopIIβ-DNA covalent complexes but not oxidative DNA damages were specifically processed by the proteasome to induce DNA damage signals (Fig. 6A). To date, little is known about the molecular mechanism for the repair of covalent protein-DNA adducts. Studies of topoisomerases and Spo11 (a TopII-like protein involved in initiation of meiotic recombination (19Keeney S. Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To test this possibility, we have evaluated the role of proteasome in the induction of DNA damage in VP-16-treated cells. Using neutral comet assay, we have monitored the formation of DSBs in VP-16-treated MEFs in the presence and absence of MG132. In the presence of MG132, VP-16-induced DSBs was largely abolished, suggesting the involvement of proteasome in the induction of DSBs in VP-16-treated cells. Additionally, we have monitored the induction of the DNA damage signal γ-H2AX which is widely used as a signal for DSBs (18Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 617-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Indeed, the VP-16-induced γ-H2AX signal in MEFs is reduced in the presence of MG-132, suggesting the involvement of proteasome in induction of DNA damage by VP-16. The two TopII isozymes are known to be regulated very differently (27Capranico G. Tinelli S. Austin C.A. Fisher M.L. Zunino F. Biochim. Biophys.

Cancer. 1997; 75: 1340-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and their covalent DNA adducts could be repaired by different pathways. TopIIα, which is only expressed in proliferating and tumor cells, has been located in replication foci in S phase possibly through its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (31Niimi A. Suka N. Harata M. Kikuchi A. Mizuno S. Chromosoma. 2001; 110: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, TopIIα (identified as the major chromosome scaffold protein Sc1), together with condensin, form the structural scaffold for mitotic chromosomes (32Saitoh N. Goldberg I. Earnshaw W.C. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It appears that TopIIα plays an important role in cell cycle events such as DNA replication, chromosome condensation/decondensation, and sister-chromatid segregation (33DiNardo S. Voelkel K.

By contrast, TopIIβ is present in all cells including terminally differentiated cells and has been shown to be involved in transcription (15Lyu Y.L. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2006; 26: 7929-7941Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We have evaluated the role of proteasome in the processing of TopII isozyme-DNA covalent complexes into DNA damage. The TopII isozyme responsible for the VP-16-induced γ-H2AX signal in MEFs is primarily TopIIα, since the similar level of VP-16-induced γ-H2AX signal was observed in top2β-/- and top2β+/- MEFs. Consequently, we conclude that proteasome is involved in the processing of TopIIα-DNA covalent complexes into DSBs. However, inhibition of proteasome with MG132 only led to a 40% reduction of the VP-16-induced γ-H2AX signal, suggesting the possible existence of a proteasome-independent pathway(s) for processing TopIIα cleavage complexes into DNA damage. TopIIα-DNA covalent complexes may be processed by another mechanism due to its predominant role in cell cycle events such as DNA replication. TopIIα-DNA covalent complexes could undergo collisions with replication forks (44D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar) and trigger a proteasome-independent mechanism for repair. Clearly, further studies are necessary to establish the mode of repair of TopIIα-DNA covalent complexes. We have also demonstrated that proteasome is involved in the processing of TopIIβ-DNA covalent complexes into DNA damage. Using postmitotic neurons where only TopIIβ is expressed, we have shown that VP-16 induces proteasome-dependent degradation of TopIIβ. Parallel to TopIIβ degradation in VP-16-treated neurons, accumulation of ATM-S1981-P and γ-H2AX, as well as the formation of DSB foci were observed and shown to be proteasome-dependent. The proteasome dependence for the generation of the DNA damage signal, γ-H2AX, appears to be specific for VP-16 since hydrogen peroxide-induced γ-H2AX is independent of proteasome, suggesting that proteasome is specifically required for processing of TopIIβ-DNA adducts (Fig. 6A). Our results could best be explained by the model shown in Fig. 6B. In this model, VP-16 stabilizes both TopIIα- and TopIIβ-DNA covalent complexes in the form of reversible TopII cleavage complexes. Proteasomal degradation of TopII cleavage complexes exposes TopII-concealed DSBs which are then recognized by the DNA damage repair system(s). At the present time, it is unclear whether proteasome is directly or indirectly involved in processing TopII-DNA covalent complexes. However, the specific requirement of proteasome for VP-16-induced, but not hydrogen peroxide-induced, DNA damage in postmitotic neurons suggests a possible direct role of proteasome in processing TopIIβ-DNA adducts. VP-16-stabilized TopII-DNA covalent complexes are reversible (45Hsiang Y.H. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9713-9715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested the lethality of these reversible TopII-DNA covalent complexes requires fixation through their interactions (collisions) with DNA helix-tracking processes such as advancing DNA replication forks, transcribing RNA polymerase elongation complexes, and translocating helicases. Previous studies have demonstrated that degradation of TopIIβ is transcription-dependent (12Mao Y. Desai S.D. Ting C.Y. Hwang J. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40652-40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), consistent with its predominant role in transcription. It seems possible that proteasomal degradation of TopIIβ-DNA covalent complexes could be triggered by their collisions with the transcription elongation complexes within the actively transcribed genes (12Mao Y. Desai S.D. Ting C.Y. Hwang J. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40652-40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, the triggering event for proteasomal degradation of TopIIα-DNA covalent complexes remains unclear. Further studies are necessary to establish the molecular mechanism for the repair of these TopII isozyme-specific DNA adducts. We are grateful to Dr. J. C. Wang for providing the top2β+/- mouse strain."

Here, we show an abrupt and early reactivation of the European hydrological cycle at the onset of the last deglaciation, leading to intense discharge of the Channel River into the Bay of Biscay. This freshwater influx, probably combined with inputs from proglacial or ice-dammed lakes, dramatically affected the hydrology of the region, both on land and in the ocean."

It belongs to a family of CAG expansion diseases and is caused by the pathological elongation of the CAG repeats in exon one of the huntingtin protein gene (1The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research GroupCell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6990) Google Scholar). Symptoms and disease progression are caused by dysfunction and loss of neurons starting in the striatum (specifically medium spiny neurons), but progressing to cortex and to a lesser extent to other brain regions in the later stages of the disease (2Vonsattel J.P. DiFiglia M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). Disease is caused by the toxic gain of function of mutant protein but some loss of function may also contribute to the pathogenesis (for review see Ref. 3Cattaneo E. Rigamonti D. Goffredo D.

Mitochondrial dysfunction in HD has been suggested primarily by the studies showing impairment of mitochondrial complexes (II, III, and IV) specifically in the striatum in the late stages HD patients (8Gu M.

Administration of the mitochondrial complex II inhibitor 3-nitropropionic (3-NP) in both rodents and nonhuman primates resulted in symptoms and neuropathology that resemble HD (11Beal M.F. Brouillet E. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Miller J.M. Storey E. Srivastava R. Rosen B.R. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4181-4192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brouillet E.

Further, studies have shown impairment of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering in HD lymphoblast cell line and brain mitochondria from the full-length mutant huntingtin transgenic mice (YAC72) (7Panov A.V.

Striatum, the primary region to get affected in HD is highly innervated by cortical glutaminergic projections (2Vonsattel J.P. DiFiglia M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). Previously it has been demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to neuronal sensitization to glutamate leading to excitotoxic cellular dysfunction and cell death (14Calabresi P. Gubellini P. Picconi B. Centonze D. Pisani A. Bonsi P. Greengard P. Hipskind R.A. Borrelli E. Bernardi G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5110-5120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Henshaw R. Jenkins B.G. Schulz J.B. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Rosen B.R. Beal M.F. Brain Res. 1994; 647: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Hence, even though HD is not a classic mitochondrial disease (16Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar), elucidation of mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms would likely provide important insight in HD pathogenesis. To study the effects of mutant huntingtin on mitochondrial function, conditionally immortalized cells of striatal origin that express endogenous, comparable levels of either wild type (STHdhQ7/Q7) or mutant (STHdhQ111/Q111) huntingtin were used (17Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). These cell lines are prepared from wild type (HdhQ7/Q7) and mutant huntingtin knock-in mice (HdhQ111/Q111) (17Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and therefore the STHdhQ111/Q111 cell line is a genetically accurate cell model of HD. In our previous study (18Milakovic T. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30773-30782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of mutant huntingtin on mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes using STHdhQ7/Q7 and STHdhQ111/Q111 cell lines. Given the fact that the metabolic thresholds and enzyme activities of electron transport chain complexes were not different between the two cell lines, it is likely that the mitochondrial complex deficits are a later event in the course of HD pathogenesis, indeed in low grade HD cases no deficits in the enzyme activities of electron transport chain complexes were observed (19Guidetti P. Charles V. Chen E.Y. Reddy P.H. Kordower J.H. Whetsell W.O. Schwarcz Jr., R. Tagle D.A. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 169: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effects of Ca2+ on mitochondria from STHdhQ7/Q7 and STHdhQ111/Q111 cells. Isolated mitochondria were treated with increasing Ca2+ concentrations and mitochondrial function was assessed using different assays. We determined that mutant huntingtin-expressing cells have decreased Ca2+ uptake capacity, and exhibit increased sensitivity to Ca2+-induced decreases in respiration and ΔΨm. The ΔΨm defect was attenuated in the presence of ADP and the decrease in Ca2+ uptake capacity was abolished in the presence of Permeability Transition Pore (PTP) inhibitors. This study clearly demonstrates that mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity in STHdhQ111/Q111 cells is compromised, and suggests increased sensitivity to Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeabilization as a mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in HD. Materials—All chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. All buffers used in experiments with crude mitochondrial preparations were prepared in water (Sigma, catalogue no. 95305) that is standardized for Ca2+ content ([Ca2+]≤ 0.000001%). Cell Culture—In this study, conditionally immortalized striatal progenitor cell lines: STHdhQ7/Q7 cell line expressing endogenous wild type huntingtin and the homozygous mutant STHdhQ111/Q111 cell line expressing comparable levels of mutant huntingtin with 111 glutamines were used. Cell lines were prepared from wild type mice and homozygous HdhQ111/Q111 knock-in mice and were described previously (17Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Culturing conditions were the same as described in our previous study (18Milakovic T. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30773-30782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Isolation of Mitochondria—Cells were grown on 150-mm plates until ≈ 80–90% confluency, washed twice with cavitation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.3 corrected with 5 m KOH) and scraped into cavitation buffer using soft rubber scrapers. Cells were opened using N2 cavitation for 5 min at 250 psi on ice, and samples were additionally homogenized with 1 stroke in a glass Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were aspirated, and pellets were resuspended in cavitation buffer and used as crude mitochondrial preparations. Protein concentrations in crude mitochondrial preparations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and aliquots were then prepared that contained the indicated protein content for each measurement. Aliquots were centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min and kept on ice in cavitation buffer until use in each assay. Measurement of Mitochondrial Respiration—Respiration rates were measured using an oxygraph (Hansatech Instruments) as described previously (18Milakovic T. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30773-30782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Crude mitochondrial preparations (0.5-mg aliquots) were resuspended in respiration buffer (130 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm potassium phosphate (KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 1:1.78), 1% essentially fatty acids free bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2 adjusted with 5 m KOH) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The mitochondrial suspension (0.5 ml volume) was placed in the respiratory chamber and allowed to equilibrate for 2 min. Respiratory substrate (glutamate (10 mm) plus malate (10 mm) or succinate (5 mm) with rotenone (10 μm)) was then added and state 4 respiration was measured for 2 min, ADP (1.5 mm) was then added, and state 3 respiration was measured for a further 2–4 min. Rates were normalized to citrate synthase activity in the same samples. Citrate synthase activity was determined as previously described (18Milakovic T. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30773-30782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Titration Experiments—Respiration buffers containing specific free Ca2+ concentrations (Ca2+-EGTA respiration buffers) were prepared on the day of the experiment. To calculate the amount of total Ca2+ that was needed to achieve the appropriate free Ca2+ concentration in the respiration buffer that contained 2 mm EGTA we used MaxChelator software (20Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Each Ca2+-EGTA respiration buffer was prepared separately by diluting each specific 100× CaCl2 stock in the respiration buffer and correcting its pH to 7.2 using 0.1 m KOH in the respiration buffer. CaCl2 stocks were prepared from CaCl2·2H2O (minimum 99%), that was dried overnight and stored in a desiccation chamber until use. Crude mitochondrial preparations were dissolved in prepared Ca2+-EGTA respiration buffers, and respiration rates were measured as described above. The period between buffer addition to the mitochondrial preparation and initiation of state 3 was ∼5 min. Free Ca2+ concentrations in the Ca2+-EGTA buffers were checked using a calibrated Ca2+ electrode on the day of the experiment. Measured concentrations were averaged and presented on the X-axis of Ca2+ titration experiments graphs. Actually concentrations were always slightly higher than those calculated by software. Cytochrome c and NADH Respiration Experiments—Respiration experiments were performed as described above. State 3 respiration was measured for 2 min prior to the addition of cytochrome c (30 μm), and respiration was monitored for another 2 min. This was followed by the addition of NADH (5 mm), and respiration was monitored for an additional 2 min. Determination of Mitochondrial Ca2+ Uptake Capacity—Ca2+ uptake capacities were measured using a Ca2+ electrode (World Precision Instruments). Crude mitochondrial preparation was resuspended in Ca2+ uptake buffer (130 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm potassium phosphate (KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 1:1.78), 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2 adjusted with 5 m KOH) and placed in the oxygraph respiratory chamber. The respiratory chamber was thermostatted at 37 °C, and its contents were constantly mixed with an electromagnetic stirrer bar. Glutamate (10 mm) and malate (10 mm) were added as respiratory substrates. Ca2+ and reference electrodes were added to the chamber from the top. Starting volume of the reaction was 2 ml. The chamber was kept open during an experiment. Ca2+ additions were performed using fine tubing and a Hamilton syringe. 5, 10, and 20 mm CaCl2 stocks were used to make 10, 20, 40, or 80 nmol of Ca2+ additions. The Ca2+ electrode measures extramitochondrial Ca2+ and increases in the signal present as downward deflections on the traces. To observe the effects of PTP inhibition on Ca2+ uptake capacity we used cyclosporine A (1 μm) plus ADP (50 μm) plus oligomycin (2 μg/ml). The PTP inhibitors were added to the respiratory chamber prior to Ca2+ additions (21Panov A.V. Andreeva L. Greenamyre J.T. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 424: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To calculate Ca2+ uptake capacity, we counted number of Ca2+ additions until the addition after which no uptake was observed (trace horizontal). The number of additions was multiplied by the nmol of Ca2+ per addition, and normalized to protein content. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm) Determination in Live Cells—Mitochondrial membrane potential was estimated using the specific mitochondrial probes: Mitotracker Red (CM-H2TMRos) and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) (Molecular Probes) (22Leski M.L.

The cells were then loaded for 30 min with CM-H2TMRos in KRH-glucose, washed, and allowed to equilibrate for 15 min. Cell plates were then mounted in a chamber on the stage of a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica model TCS SP2). Quantitative measurements of CM-H2TMRos fluorescence were performed by confocal microscopy (Leica model TCS SP2), using a 40× water immersion lens. CM-H2TMRos fluorescence images were obtained by excitation at 563 nm, reflection off a dichroic mirror with a cut-off wavelength at 564 nm, and longpass emission filtering at 590 nm. For TMRE experiments, cells were loaded with TMRE (100 nm) for 45 min in KRH-glucose, and then were mounted on the stage for confocal microscopy. TMRE fluorescence was detected exciting with a 561 nm He-Ne laser line very heavily attenuated (10% laser power), and the emission was collected at >563 nm (22Leski M.L. Hassinger L.C. Valentine S.L. Baer J.D. Coyle J.T. Synapse. 2002; 43: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Signal from control cells and cells treated with different stimuli were compared using identical settings for laser power, confocal thickness, and detector sensitivity for each dye and separate experiment (23Collins T.J.

The images were analyzed with LCS Leica confocal software and recorded as the mean Mitotracker Red or TMRE fluorescence signal per live cell. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm) in Mitochondrial Preparations—ΔΨm was measured using 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1; Molecular Probes) according to a published protocol with modifications (27Ruan Q. Lesort M. MacDonald M.E. Johnson G.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Modifications were made so that method could be used with isolated mitochondria. To measure ΔΨm at different Ca2+ concentrations, crude mitochondrial preparation was aliquoted into the wells of 96-well plate (50 μg/well). The plate was centrifuged at 3220 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were carefully aspirated. Ca-EGTA respiration buffers with 0, 0.4, or 0.6 μm (software calculated) free Ca2+ or Ca2+ uptake buffer with 150, 500, or 1000 μm Ca2+ each supplemented with glutamate (10 mm), malate (10 mm), and with (for state 3) or without (for state 4) ADP (1.5 mm) were added to separate wells in duplicates (50 μl/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were carefully aspirated, and the same buffers but containing JC-1 (5 μg/ml) were added to the wells (50 μl/well). Wells in which FCCP (20 μm) was also added were considered as positive controls. The plate was incubated for 30 min, at 37 °C in dark, supernatants were aspirated, and fluorescence was read at 485/528 nm and 530/590 nm. The ratio between the fluorescence was used to describe ΔΨm as published previously (27Ruan Q. Lesort M. MacDonald M.E. Johnson G.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Measurement of Mitochondrial H2O2 Production—To determine mitochondrial ROS production we used an Amplex Red (Molecular Probes) assay (28Chen Q. Vazquez E.J. Moghaddas S. Hoppel C.L. Lesnefsky E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36027-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Crude mitochondrial preparations were aliquoted (100 μg/well) and pelleted onto a 96-well plate as described for measuring ΔΨm. Mitochondrial pellets were covered with Ca-EGTA respiration buffers with 0, 0.4, or 0.6 μm (software calculated) free Ca2+ or Ca2+ uptake buffer with 150, 500, or 1000 μm Ca2+ each supplemented with glutamate (10 mm), malate (10 mm), Amplex Red (50 μm), horseradish peroxidase (0.01 units/ml or 0.1 units/ml), and with (for state 3) or without (for state 4) ADP (1.5 mm). Plate was read in the kinetic mode for 30 min at excitation/emission wavelengths 530/590 nm at 37 °C. Rates of H2O2 production were determined using a standard curve. Statistical Analysis—Results were analyzed using ANOVA, Student's t test, or paired t test as indicated. Differences were considered significant if p ≤ 0.05. Effects of Ca2+ on Respiration in Mitochondria from STH-dhQ7/Q7 (Wild Type) and STHdhQ111/Q111 (Mutant) Cells—It has been shown previously that at the free concentrations higher than 1 μm, Ca2+ causes strong inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (29Moreno-Sanchez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4028-4034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effects of Ca2+ on oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria isolated from the cells expressing endogenous levels of wild type (STHdhQ7/Q7) or mutant (STHdhQ111/Q111) huntingtin, we measured state 4 and state 3 respiration rates in respiration buffers containing increasing free μm Ca2+ concentrations. In these experiments, EGTA-based respiration buffer was used for 0 μm Ca2+ and Ca2+-EGTA respiration buffers were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At 0 μm Ca2+, we observed no differences in the state 4 or state 3 respiration rates between wild type and mutant cells when glutamate plus malate (complex I substrate) or succinate (complex II substrate) were used as substrates (Fig. 1A). As described earlier (29Moreno-Sanchez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4028-4034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with increasing free μm Ca2+ concentrations decreases in the state 3 rates were observed (Fig. 1B). However, this decrease was more pronounced in the mitochondria from the mutant huntingtin-expressing cells, reaching significance at lower Ca2+ concentrations than in the wild type (Fig. 1B). State 4 rates increased with increasing Ca2+ concentrations, reaching significance only in the mutant at the highest Ca2+ concentration used (Fig. 1B). To describe overall changes in the respiration rates, we calculated Respiratory Control Ratios (RCRs) at the different Ca2+ concentrations. RCR was calculated as the ratio between state 3 and state 4 rates. A decrease in RCR was observed with increasing Ca2+ concentrations and was more pronounced in mitochondria from mutant cells, reaching significance at the lower Ca2+ concentrations than in the wild type cells (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that mitochondria from STHdhQ111/Q111 (mutant) cells are more sensitive to Ca2+-induced changes in oxidative phosphorylation than mitochondria from STH-dhQ7/Q7 (wild type) cells. Ca2+ Uptake Capacity in Mitochondria from STHdhQ7/Q7 (Wild Type) and STHdhQ111/Q111 (Mutant) Cells—Several studies have suggested that there is reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity in HD. Panov et al. (7Panov A.V. Gutekunst C.A. Leavitt B.R. Hayden M.R. Burke J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 13Panov A.

Neurosci. 2002; 5: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), whereas others demonstrated diminished Ca2+ uptake in muscle mitochondria from R6/2 mice (30Gizatullina Z.Z. Lindenberg K.S. Harjes P. Chen Y. Kosinski C.M. Landwehrmeyer B.G. Ludolph A.C. Striggow F. Zierz S. Gellerich F.N. Ann Neurol. 2006; 59: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To comprehensively describe the effects of Ca2+ on mitochondria in our model, we determined mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake capacity in STHdhQ7/Q7 (wild type) and STHdhQ111/Q111 (mutant) cells. For these experiments we used a Ca2+-sensitive electrode, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To determine, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, isolated mitochondria (1.5 mg/2 ml) were placed in a 37 °C thermostatted chamber and challenged with 10-nmol Ca2+ pulses every 3 min. Representative traces are shown in Fig. 2C. Ca2+ uptake capacity was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We observed that mitochondria from STHdhQ111/Q111 (mutant) cells have significantly diminished Ca2+ uptake capacity compared with mitochondria from STHdhQ7/Q7 (wild type) cells (Fig. 2A). To determine the “initial uptake” rates we calculated the average of the rates after the second, third, and fourth additions of Ca2+ and determined that the “initial uptake” rates were significantly diminished in the mitochondria from the mutant cells (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that mitochondria from STHdhQ111/Q111 (mutant) cells have a Ca2+-buffering defect, as they can take up less Ca2+ than the mitochondria from wild type cells. Because ER contamination of the mitochondrial preparation was a possibility, we confirmed the mitochondrial nature of the Ca2+ uptake in our mitochondrial preparations, as the addition of uncoupler (FCCP) caused release of Ca2+, and pretreatment of the cells with thapsigargin (which blocks the Ca2+ uptake pump of the ER Ref. 31Paschen W. Doutheil J. Gissel C. Treiman M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1735-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) did not produce any change in the Ca2+ uptake capacity (Fig. 2D). Analysis of Mitochondrial Membrane Integrity Before and After Ca2+ Addition in STHdhQ7/Q7 (Wild Type) and STH-dhQ111/Q111 (Mutant) Cells—Ca2+ overload of mitochondria results in increased mitochondrial membrane permeability (32Forte M. Bernardi P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To further study the cause of differences between mitochondria from wild type and mutant cells in their sensitivity to Ca2+, we wanted to determine if the decrease in respiration observed in the presence of free μm Ca2+ concentrations was associated with increased permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. First, we analyzed the integrity of mitochondrial membrane in the basal conditions. NADH is the substrate for mitochondrial complex I. However, the inner mitochondrial membrane is not permeable to exogenous NADH (33Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed."

Overexpression of the chaperones Hsp104 or Hsp70 rescues growth defects in affected cells without resolving inclusions. However, aggregates formed by nontoxic Huntingtin derivatives or by toxic derivatives cured by chaperones are physically distinct from aggregates formed by toxic proteins.

(1Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). A key feature of these dominantly inherited diseases is the presence of aggregated poly(Q) inclusions in affected neurons (2Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A.

The age of onset of these dominantly inherited diseases inversely correlates with the length of the poly(Q) expansion. HD is caused by a poly(Q) expansion in a protein named Huntingtin (Htt), which leads to the aggregation of a proteolytic, amino-terminal fragment of Htt encompassing the poly(Q) repeat (2Davies S.W.

However, the mechanism by which aggregated poly(Q) proteins contribute to cellular dysfunction is still a matter of debate (5Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). Quality control pathways have evolved to protect cells from the deleterious effect of aberrant proteins, and studies in several model systems have shown that increasing Hsp70 or Hsp40 chaperones could modulate aggregation of expanded poly(Q) (6Muchowski P.J.

Strikingly, however, Hsp70 or Hsp40 overexpression in Drosophila suppresses the neurotoxicity of expanded poly(Q) without removing inclusions (7Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y.

The poly(Q) expansion might trigger cellular dysfunction by a similar mechanism in the different diseases and the sequence neighboring the poly(Q) stretch might confer disease specificity. In Htt, two proline repeats separated by a proline-rich region are located at the carboxyl terminus of the poly(Q) repeat and have been shown to be important for interaction with several proteins (14Liu Y.F.

Because the link between poly(Q) aggregation and toxicity is still subjected to controversy, the effect of the proline-rich region on poly(Q) toxicity could not be anticipated. Here we have found that deleting the whole proline-rich region in Htt dramatically alters the shape of poly(Q) inclusions and unmasks toxicity in yeast cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Manipulations—The wild-type yeast strain W303 (MAT α ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, ura3-1) and isogenic hsp104 deletion strain Δhsp104 (hsp104::LEU2+) were kindly provided by S.

Genet. 2001; 39: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using the NruI and XhoI site into the centromeric plasmid p416GPD.The gene encoding Ssa1 was cloned by PCR amplification on genomic DNA of the W303 strain using oligonucleotides flanked by convenient restriction sites to allow cloning into the p416GPD vector. Cloning was verified by DNA sequencing.Fluorescence Microscopy—Exponentially growing cells were used for fluorescence microscopy study, and micrographs were taken at 100× magnification.Protein Extraction, Immunoblots, and Antibodies—Yeast cells of a 20-ml exponentially growing culture were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 revolutions/min for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 300 μl of spheroplasting buffer (1 m sorbitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 6.5 mg/ml zymolyase 20T (ICN Biochemicals, Inc.), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5) and incubated for 1 h at 30°C. Spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 revolutions/min for 5 min at 4 °C and lysed in 1 ml of Laemmli buffer, 18 μl of which was analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by a GFP immunoblot. Immunoblotting procedure was as described in (25Rousseau E. Dehay B. Ben-Haiem L. Trottier Y. Morange M. Bertolotti A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Equal loading of whole yeast cell extracts analyzed by immunoblot was verified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of 5 μl of extracts separated by SDS-PAGE. Anti-Hsp104 antibody was from Stressgen and anti-GFP antibody from BD Biosciences. Chemiluminescent images were acquired using the Chemi-smart 5000 allowing quantitative detection of chemiluminescence and signals of interest were quantified using Bio-1D software (Vilber Lourmat).Formic Acid Solubilization of Insoluble Pellets from Yeast Cells—10 ml of exponentially growing culture were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 revolutions/min for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), lysed on ice for 1 h, and disrupted by 4 min of vortexing with 425–600-μm acid-washed glass beads. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 3000 revolutions/min for 1 min. Ultracentrifugation of 200 μl of extract at 355,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h with a TLA120.2 rotor and an Optima Max ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) was used to separate soluble and insoluble material. The resulting ultracentrifugation pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 200 μl of formic acid at 37 °C for 1 h. Suspensions in formic acid were vacuum-dried and resuspended in 200 μl of Laemmli buffer. 18 μl of supernatant or solubilized pellet fraction was analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by a GFP immunoblot.Sucrose Velocity Gradient Sedimentation—200 μl of yeast protein extracts were loaded onto a 4-ml linear 30–80% sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 15 h at 194,000 × g at 18 °C using a SW40Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) and a L-70 Beckman ultracentrifuge. Twenty-eight fractions of 150 μl were collected in each gradient from top (fraction 1) to bottom (fraction 28) (Figs. 2C and 4D), 15 μl of which were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblots. Quantifications are presented as percentage of total amount of aggregated proteins loaded on the gradient.RESULTSTo study poly(Q) aggregation in yeast, we used the aminoterminal region of Htt corresponding to exon 1, which encompasses the proline-rich region and a poly(Q) stretch with either 25 (wild type), 47, 72, or 103 (mutant) glutamines fused to GFP (Fig. 1A). When Htt constructs were expressed in yeast cells, intracellular distribution of GFP fusion protein appeared as previously reported (10Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The fluorescence in cells expressing QP25 is always diffusely distributed, whereas cells expressing QP47, -72, and -103 contain bright fluorescent foci, presumably corresponding to aggregated protein, which size augments with the length of the poly(Q) repeat (Fig. 1B). Deleting the prolinerich region in the wild-type Htt exon1, thereby generating Q25, did not alter the distribution of the protein (Fig. 1, A and B). However, when Q47, Q72, and Q103, corresponding to mutant Htt-exon1-GFP proteins lacking the proline-rich region fused to GFP (Fig. 1A), were expressed in yeast, cells contained numerous small foci (Fig. 1B). Foci formed by Q47–103 were swarming in contrast to the aggregates of QP47–103, which did not move within the cell (data not shown). Deleting the prolinerich region in Htt derivatives with expanded poly(Q) repeats increased the number of foci formed in yeast cells, although reducing their size. We next assessed the ratio of soluble and insoluble poly(Q)-containing proteins on total SDS lysates analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblots (Fig. 1C). Although soluble proteins migrate in SDS-PAGE, SDS-insoluble aggregate poly(Q) are retained at the top of the gel (4Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Proteins with 25Q were completely soluble. Although QP47 formed foci visible by microscopy, insoluble poly(Q) were hardly detected in extracts of cells expressing QP47 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, insoluble Q47 proteins were readily detectable by immunoblot (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the fraction of SDS-insoluble aggregates was larger in cells expressing Q72 or Q103 than in cells expressing QP72 and QP103, respectively (Fig. 1C). This result is consistent with the fact that all of the fluorescence emanating from Q72 and Q103 is in small foci, and there is almost no trace of diffuse fluorescence (Fig. 1B). Expanded poly(Q) aggregates are sometimes difficult to transfer on immunoblot. Increasing amounts of cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot, and both the soluble and insoluble proteins were quantified (supplemental Fig. 1). This analysis demonstrates that our experimental conditions allow a quantitative detection of soluble and insoluble poly(Q)-containing proteins. To further address whether an experimental bias might impair the conclusiveness of the experiments, proteins of cells expressing QP25, -72, -103 or Q25, -72, -103 were extracted and fractionated in soluble and insoluble fractions. The pellets, containing insoluble material, were dissolved by formic acid (26Hazeki N. Tukamoto T. Goto J. Kanazawa I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and subjected to immunoblot. Proteins with 25 glutamines were exclusively detected in the soluble fraction. In contrast, QP72 partitioned equally between the soluble and insoluble fraction (Fig. 1D). Deletion of the proline-rich region in QP72 reduced the solubility of the protein, as Q72 was almost exclusively detected in the solubilized pellet, in good agreement with Fig. 1C. Moreover, this analysis also indicates that QP72 and Q72 were expressed at comparable levels. There was also more Q103 in the insoluble fraction than QP103. However, the effect of the proline-rich region on the aggregation of expanded poly(Q) were more pronounced with proteins of 47 and 72 glutamines than 103. Growth of various strains was monitored both on liquid media and in spotting assays (Fig. 2, A and B). Although cells expressing different QP proteins or empty vector have a generation time of 3 h (Fig. 2, A and B, and data not shown), indicating that these expanded poly(Q)-containing proteins are not toxic in yeast as previously reported (6Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 10Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), we noticed that expression of Q72 and Q103 retarded cell growth with a magnitude that increased with the length of poly(Q) (Fig. 2, A and B). Cells expressing Q72 or Q103 have a generation time of 4 or 9.6 h, respectively. This result indicated that cells expressing Q72 or Q103 have a marked growth defect. While this manuscript was under revision, the group of S. Lindquist (27Duennwald M.L. Jagadish S. Muchowski P.J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11045-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) reported observations that support our conclusions. To further characterize the differences between the toxic Q72 and non-toxic QP72 proteins, total cell lysates were fractionated on sucrose gradients (28Schrodel A. de Marco A. BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This biochemical analysis indicated that QP72 aggregates are heterogeneous and sediment in fractions ranging from 9 to 19 in contrast to the vast majority of Q72 aggregates fractionating in fractions 9–11 (Fig. 2C). Thus, the proline-rich region in Htt has a dramatic effect on the physical properties of aggregates in yeast, and its absence converts a benign protein into a toxic one.FIGURE 1Deletion of the proline-rich region in the amino-terminal region of Htt alters aggregation of expanded poly(Q) in yeast.

Among the yeast chaperones, Hsp104 has a remarkable effect, as its deletion abolishes expanded poly(Q) aggregation (10Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether hsp104 deletion affects aggregation of expanded poly(Q) proteins lacking the proline-rich region. QP25–103 and Q25–103 proteins were expressed in hsp104 deletion strain and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 3A). As previously reported (10Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), the absence of Hsp104 impedes the formation of aggregates of proteins containing up to 103 glutamines (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, Htt derivatives with 47-, 72-, and 103Q lacking the proline-rich region formed a large and often unique focus in a substantial number of hsp104 deletion cells that were comparable in size to QP47, -72, and -103 formed in wild-type cells based on microscopic observation (Figs. 1A and 3A). Having shown in Fig. 1D and in supplemental Fig. 1 that our immunoblots can be used quantitatively to assess the level of aggregated or soluble expanded poly(Q) derivatives, Q47, Q72, and Q103 in the hsp104 deletion strain were analyzed on total protein extracts by immunoblots. No insoluble poly(Q) proteins were detected on immunoblots of total cell lysates from cells expressing QP47 and QP72, and only a trace of insoluble QP103 was formed in the hsp104 deletion strain (Fig. 3B). In contrast, traces of insoluble Q47 proteins were detected, and insoluble Q72 and Q103 were readily detected in the hsp104 deletion strain (Fig. 3B). Thus, deletion of the proline-rich region in the amino-terminal region of mutant Htt bypassed the requirement of Hsp104 for aggregate formation in a substantial number of yeast cells. Strikingly, deletion of hsp104 in cells expressing Q72 and Q103 suppressed the growth defects observed in wild-type cells expressing Q72 and Q103 (Fig. 3C). On sucrose gradients, Q72 aggregates formed in the hsp104 deletion strain exhibited a profile similar to that of QP72 expressed in the wild-type strain (Fig. 4D). Thus Q72 expressed in the hsp104 deletion strain resembled QP72 in wild-type cells, as they exhibited similar sedimentation properties and do not compromise cell growth.We next examined whether reintroducing Hsp104 affects aggregation in cells where poly(Q) aggregates were formed in the absence of this chaperone. A substantial number of cells deleted for hsp104 and expressing Q47, Q72, and Q103 contained a single bright fluorescent focus, whereas the others exhibited diffuse fluorescence, presumably corresponding to soluble proteins (Fig. 4A). Strikingly, reintroducing Hsp104 provoked the formation of numerous small swarming foci in virtually each cell expressing Q47, Q72, and Q103, whereas diffuse fluorescence disappeared (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that Hsp104 rescued the formation of aggregates whose shape and number were comparable with those formed in wild-type cells (Figs. 4A and 1B). In contrast, aggregation of QP103 is irreversibly lost upon deletion of hsp104 (Ref. 11Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar and data not shown). Cell extracts were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot and revealed that reintroduction of Hsp104 in hsp104-deleted cells dramatically augments the amounts of insoluble Q47, Q72, and Q103 to levels similar to those observed in wild-type cells, while reducing the quantity of soluble Q72 and Q103 (Fig. 4B). However, Q72 and Q103 were no longer toxic in (Δhsp104+Hsp104) cells (Fig. 4C). This indicated that, despite similar aggregate shape and a similar ratio of soluble versus insoluble protein, the properties of the poly(Q)-containing protein were dramatically different in distin"

Here, we demonstrate that arrestin-2 and GRK5 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5), proteins that regulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling, play a negative role in TLR4 signaling in Raw264.7 macrophages. We find that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation is significantly enhanced in arrestin-2 and GRK5 knockdown cells. To elucidate the mechanisms involved, we tested the effect of arrestin-2 and GRK5 knockdown on LPS-stimulated signaling components that are upstream of ERK phosphorylation. Upon LPS stimulation, IκB kinase promotes phosphorylation and degradation of NFκB1 p105 (p105), which releases TPL2 (a MAP3K), which phosphorylates MEK1/2, which in turn phosphorylates ERK1/2. We demonstrate that knockdown of arrestin-2 leads to enhanced LPS-induced phosphorylation and degradation of p105, enhanced TPL2 release, and enhanced MEK1/2 phosphorylation. GRK5 knockdown also results in enhanced IκB kinase-mediated p105 phosphorylation and degradation, whereas GRK2 and GRK6 knockdown have no effect on this pathway. In vitro analysis demonstrates that arrestin-2 directly binds to the COOH-terminal domain of p105, whereas GRK5 binds to and phosphorylates p105. Taken together, these results suggest that p105 phosphorylation by GRK5 and binding of arrestin-2 negatively regulates LPS-stimulated ERK activation. These results reveal that arrestin-2 and GRK5 are important negative regulatory components in TLR4 signaling.

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns in microbes serve as ligands to activate a recently described class of pattern recognition receptors called Toll-like receptors (TLRs). 3The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; pERK, phospho-ERK; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; IκB, inhibitor of NFκB; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IKK, IκB kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase. 3The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; pERK, phospho-ERK; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; IκB, inhibitor of NFκB; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IKK, IκB kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase. 13 TLRs have been identified to date, with TLR1, -2, -4, -5, -6, and -11 displayed on the cell surface and TLR3, -7, -8, and -9 localized intracellularly (1Kawai T. Akira S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Activation of TLR signaling constitutes one of the earliest responses of an organism to microbe invasion and understanding the signaling pathways stimulated by these TLRs is an area of intense interest. The TLRs as well as interleukin receptors have a conserved ∼200-amino acid region in their cytoplasmic tails, known as the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain. Within the TIR domain are conserved regions that are crucial for signaling. After ligand binding, the TLRs dimerize and undergo conformational changes that are required for the recruitment of downstream signaling molecules (2Kawai T. Akira S. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2005; 7: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These include the adaptor molecule Myd88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases, TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase), TAK1-binding protein (TAB1 and -2), and TRAF-6 (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6) (3Suzuki N.

Immunol. 2006; 18: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar).TLRs primarily activate two major signaling pathways, nuclear factor κ-B (NFκB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK, JNK, and p38) pathways. The NFκB pathway results in activation of transcription factors that are thought to act as a “master switch” for inflammation by regulating the transcription of genes involved in immunity and inflammation (7Beinke S. Ley S.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 8Beutler B. Immunogenetics. 2005; 57: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8550) Google Scholar). The NFκB family of transcription factors includes homoor heterodimers of p50 (a product of p105), p52 (a product of p100), p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and RelB. Activation of NFκB is controlled by an inhibitory subunit, inhibitor of NFκB(IκB), which retains the NFκB subunits in the cytosol. The IκB family of proteins includes IκBα,-β, and -ϵ,NFκB1 p105 (p105) (a precursor of p50), p100 (a precursor of p52), and Bcl3 (7Beinke S. Ley S.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Upon activation by LPS and other agents, IκB is primarily phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex that results in the ubiquitination and degradation of the IκB proteins via the proteosomal pathway. Degradation of these inhibitory proteins results in the release of the NFκB transcription factors, which then translocate into the nucleus to effect gene transcription (7Beinke S. Ley S.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar).The prototypical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway involves a MAP3K that phosphorylates and activates a MAP2K that in turn phosphorylates and activates a MAPK. The most commonly studied MAPKs are ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3, and p38α/β (10Symons A. Beinke S. Ley S.C. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 40-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These are activated in response to stimulation by extracellular signals, including ligands for TLRs, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), tyrosine kinase receptors, and cytokine receptors. These kinases can regulate gene transcription by phosphorylating transcription factors in the nucleus as well as cytosolic components of the cell. In addition to the regulation of MAPKs by MAP3Ks, some of these MAP3Ks have been shown to play crucial roles in the activation of the NFκB pathway. The MAP3K transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) has been shown to functionally interact with IKKs and thus regulate the NFκB pathway (11Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J.

In addition, MKK6, ASK1, and members of the MLK3 (mixed lineage kinase-3) family have all been shown to regulate NFκB activation through interactions with upstream regulators of IκB phosphorylation (13Hehner S.P.

Thus, activation of MAP3Ks can result in stimulation of the NFκB pathway as well as the MAPK pathway.Nonvisual arrestins (arrestin-2 and -3) are multifunctional adaptor/scaffolding proteins that regulate GPCR desensitization, trafficking, and signaling (16Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Activation of GPCRs leads to a G protein-dependent as well as G protein-independent signaling (17Gesty-Palmer D. Chen M. Reiter E. Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Loomis C.R. Spurney R.F. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

This also results in the activation of a group of kinases called G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs, GRK1-7) that phosphorylate residues in the intracellular domains of the GPCRs (19Penn R.B. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).

LPS activation of the ERK pathway in macrophages involves both a MAPK pathway and the IKK-NFκB pathway (30Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9658-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). LPS stimulation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex results in phosphorylation and degradation of p105 in macrophages. This results in the release of the MAP3K TPL2 (or COT) (31Aoki M. Akiyama T. Miyoshi J. Toyoshima K. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1515-1519PubMed Google Scholar) that is stoichiometrically associated with p105 under unstimulated conditions (30Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C. Mol.

Using an RNA interference approach in the macrophage cell line Raw264.7, we demonstrate that arrestin-2 and GRK5 play a negative role in the LPS-induced phosphorylation and degradation of p105 and ERK1/2 activation, most likely via their ability to directly interact with the COOH-terminal domain of p105.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—LPS, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and tubulin antibody were from Sigma.

For creating stable cell lines expressing HA-arrestin-2 or HA-p105, Raw264.7 cells were electroporated with 1 μg of pcDNA3-HA-arrestin-2 or HA-p105 and selected using neomycin (1 mg/ml).siRNA—The siRNA sequence against mouse arrestin-2 has been described previously (37Girnita L.

Control siRNA and mouse arrestin-2, GRK2, GRK5, and GRK6 siRNAs were from Dharmacon. Transfection of siRNAs in Raw264.7 cells was performed using the Amaxa Nucleofector (program D-032). The cells were transfected and analyzed for knockdown 48 h after electroporation.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—10-cm dishes of HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the respective constructs. At 48 h after transfection, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by the addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and Roche protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were scraped, and lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 48,000 × g. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μg of supernatant protein was incubated with 25 μl of 25% protein A-agarose pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer and 10 μl of polyclonal antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 s, and the pellets were washed three times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by the addition of 15 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For Western blotting of ERK, p105, and TPL2, cells were quickly washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline before lysis with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were clarified, and then protein concentration was determined, and equivalent amounts of protein were loaded on the gels for Western blot analysis. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (23Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30760-30768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation experiments and for immunoblotting TPL2, the secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and analyzed by chemiluminescence and densitometry. For arrestin-2/3, pERK/ERK, p105/p50, actin, and tubulin, immunoblotting was performed using fluorescent secondary antibodies and blots were quantitated using the Licor Odyssey scanner.GST-p105 Expression and Purification—GST or GST-p105 fusion proteins were grown overnight at 37 °C, diluted 1:100 in LB-ampicillin, grown for 2 h at 37 °C, and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactylpyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted (6000 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were treated for 10 min with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and then aliquoted and stored at -80 °C until needed. Aliquots were thawed on ice; 0.5% (final) Sarkosyl, 1% (final) Triton X-100 were added; and cells were frozen and thawed. DNase was added to each aliquot (4 μl of 1 mg/ml per 400-μl aliquot) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The sample was centrifuged for 30 min (100,000 × g in a TLA-45 rotor), and the supernatant was then incubated with 50% glutathione-agarose bead slurry for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times. Protein amounts were determined by Bradford assay.Arrestin and GRK Binding to p105—GST or GST-p105-(497-968) fusion protein (0.63 μm each) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 80 nm purified arrestin-2 or arrestin-2-R169E in 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 120 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were centrifuged (1000 × g) for 1 min and washed three times with binding buffer. Bound arrestin was eluted with SDS sample buffer, boiled for 1 min, electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by immunoblotting using a β-arrestin 1 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) at 1:1000 dilution. For GRK binding studies, 0.4 μg of purified GRK2 or GRK5 was incubated with 10 μg of GST or GST-p105-(497-968) in interaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine, 5 mm EDTA, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were then washed in interaction buffer, and bound GRKs were eluted and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GRK2/3 (1:10,000) or anti-GRK4-6 (1:5000) monoclonal antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY).Phosphorylation Assays—2 μm purified GST-p105-(497-968) or GST was incubated with 20 nm GRK2 or GRK5 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped with SDS buffer, electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Phosphorylated p105 bands were excised and counted by liquid scintillation to obtain quantitative results.RESULTSRole of Arrestin-2 on LPS-induced ERK Phosphorylation—In order to test whether arrestin-2 is involved in LPS signaling in macrophages, we used electroporation to transfect arrestin-2-specific siRNAs into Raw264.7 cells. Control siRNA-transfected cells were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 1A, we were able to knock down arrestin-2 levels by ∼70%, whereas arrestin-3 levels were unaffected by arrestin-2 siRNA transfection. LPS treatment of Raw264.7 cells resulted in transient activation of ERK1/2 that peaked at 15-30 min (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, ERK1/2 activation was 30-50% higher in the arrestin-2 knockdown cells compared with control cells (p < 0.01), suggesting that endogenous arrestin-2 mediates an inhibitory role in LPS-promoted ERK activation in macrophages. This effect appears to be specific for LPS, since phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was comparable in control and arrestin-2 knockdown cells (Fig. 1C). Because the knockdown of arrestin-2 caused a significant increase in LPS-induced ERK activation, we hypothesized that overexpression of arrestin-2 would result in inhibition of LPS-induced ERK activation. Indeed, LPS treatment of Raw264.7 cells stably expressing HA-arrestin-2 (at levels ∼2-fold higher than endogenous arrestin-2 levels) (data not shown) resulted in significantly attenuated ERK1/2 activation compared with control cells (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Effect of LPS on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in Raw cells stably transfected with HA-vector or HA-Arrestin-2. Cells were treated for the indicated time periods. A representative blot is shown (top panel). Western blotting, quantitation, and analysis were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1B.

Upon stimulation with LPS, p105 undergoes IKK-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. This process releases TPL2 from p105, and the free TPL2 phosphorylates MEK1/2, which then phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2 (30Beinke S. Robinson M.J. Hugunin M. Ley S.C. Mol.

To identify the step in the pathway where arrestin regulates LPS-induced ERK activation, we tested the effect of LPS on p105 phosphorylation in control and arrestin-2 knockdown cells. This was done by Western blotting using an antibody specific for phosphoserine 932, one of the sites in p105 phosphorylated by IKK upon LPS stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3A, arrestin-2 knockdown resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in p105 phosphorylation after 15 min of LPS stimulation compared with control cells. Arrestin-2 knockdown also promoted a significant increase in the rate of p105 degradation (∼2-fold increase in p105 degradation at 60 min after LPS stimulation in knockdown cells compared with control cells) (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, total p50 levels remained constant suggesting that the decrease in p105/p50 ratio is because of p105 degradation (Fig. 3B). Additional experiments were conducted using arrestin-3 knockdown cells to test the specificity of LPS-induced p105 phosphorylation and degradation. Unlike arrestin-2, arrestin-3 knockdown did not affect LPS-induced p105 phosphorylation or degradation (supplementary Fig. 1). Taken together, these results suggest that the effect of arrestin-2 knockdown on LPS-induced ERK activation is at or above the level of p105 phosphorylation by IKK.FIGURE 3A, effect of LPS on NFκB1 p105 phosphorylation (of the IKK phosphorylation site serine 932) in control and arrestin-2 siRNA-transfected Raw264.7 cells.

To test if TPL2 release from p105 is enhanced in arrestin-2 knockdown cells, endogenous p105 was immuno-precipitated from Raw264.7 cells following 0, 15, or 30 min of LPS treatment. There are two forms of TPL2 in macrophages, M1 and M30, that result from the use of alternative translational start sites (32Waterfield M.R. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). TPL2 was completely associated with p105 before treatment with LPS, as assessed by p105 immunoprecipitation, whereas a significant amount of TPL2 was released from p105 after LPS treatment (Fig. 4B). TPL2 release peaked at 15 min after LPS stimulation and was reduced by the 30 min time point, probably due to degradation. The release of TPL2 at 15 min was significantly enhanced in the arrestin-2 knockdown cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4B). Moreover, this enhanced release of TPL2 at 15 min correlated well with the enhanced LPS-stimulated MEK1/2 phosphorylation that was observed in arrestin-2 knockdown cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4A, TPL2 protein expression in Raw264.7 cells detected using M20 rabbit anti-TPL2/cot antibody.

Alternative promoters and N-terminal splicing result in the transcription and processing of either full-length (TA) or N-terminally truncated (ΔN) p73 isoforms. TAp73 possesses pro-apoptotic functions, while ΔNp73 has anti-apoptotic properties via functional inhibition of TAp73 and p53. Here, we report that TAp73, but not ΔNp73, is covalently modified by NEDD8 under physiologic conditions in an Mdm2-dependent manner. Co-expression of NEDP1, a cysteine protease that specifically cleaves NEDD8 conjugates, was shown to deneddylate TAp73. In addition, blockage of the endogenous NEDD8 pathway increased TAp73-mediated transactivation of p53- and p73-responsive promoter-driven reporter activity, and in conjunction, neddylated TAp73 species were found preferentially in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that Mdm2 attenuates TAp73 transactivation function, at least in part, by promoting NEDD8-dependent TAp73 cytoplasmic localization and provide the first evidence of a covalent post-translational modification exclusively targeting the TA isoforms of p73.

Conversely, a recent study demonstrated that aged p73 heterozygous mice develop spontaneous tumors, and in comparison with p53 heterozygous mice, mice heterozygous for both p53 and p73 have different tumor spectrums and higher tumor burden and incidence of metastasis, presumably due to the loss of function of the pro-apoptotic TAp73 isoforms (18Flores E.R.

Studies have also established a role for TAp73 in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and the status of TAp73 may be an important determinant of chemotherapeutic efficacy in humans (17Concin N.

Therefore, therapeutic modulation of the relative levels of TAp73 and ΔNp73 isoforms has potential therapeutic benefits in treating human cancers. The RING finger E3 ligase Mdm2 is one of the major regulators of p53. Mdm2 promotes ubiquitination of p53 on multiple C-terminal lysines resulting in its degradation via the 26S proteasome (21Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 22Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 23Kubbutat M. Jones S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). NEDD8 is an ubiquitin-like modifier (UBL) most similar to ubiquitin. As such, NEDD8 conjugation to its substrates is mediated by an analogous pathway involving concerted actions of E1 (activating), E2 (conjugating), and E3 (ligating) enzymes (25Pan Z.Q. Kentsis A. Dias D.C. Yamoah K. Wu K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1985-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Ultimately, the mature NEDD8 with exposed C-terminal glycine forms an isopeptide bond with a lysyl residue of receptive substrates (26Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Mdm2 was shown recently to regulate NEDD8 conjugation of p53 inhibiting its transcriptional activity and thereby revealing another mechanism of p53 regulation via Mdm2 at a post-translational level (27Xirodimas D.P.

Many of the same post-translational modifications that affect p53 function, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation, and their respective regulators Chk1, p300/CBP, and PIAS1, regulate p73 (28Costanzo A.

In addition, specific regulators of p73 have been identified, such as the NEDD4-like E3 ubiquitin ligases NEDL2 and Itch (31Miyazaki K. Ozaki T. Kato C. Hanamoto T. Fujita T. Irino S. Watanabe K.

For example, Mdm2 does not promote the degradation of TAp73 but rather stabilizes TAp73 (33Balint E. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3923-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 34Ongkeko W.M. Wang X.Q. Siu W.Y. Lau A.W. Yamashita K. Harris A.L. Cox L.S. Poon R.Y. Curr.

TAp73 contains a functional nuclear export signal and Mdm2 was shown to influence the subcellular redistribution of TAp73 (36Gu J. Nie L. Kawai H. Yuan Z.M.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, Mdm2 inhibits both TAp73-mediated transactivation and apoptosis (33Balint E. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3923-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 35Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell.

In support, Mdm2 was shown to repress the transcriptional function of TAp73 by interrupting its association with transcriptional co-activators p300/CBP (35Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms associated with the various aforementioned properties of Mdm2-mediated regulation of p73 remain unclear, and post-translational modifications that differentially regulate the TA and ΔN isoforms of p73 have yet been elucidated. Here, we show that TAp73 is covalently modified by NEDD8 in an Mdm2-dependent manner. The ΔNp73 isoform, which does not possess the N-terminal Mdm2-binding site, failed to be modified by NEDD8 and the cysteine protease NEDP1, which specifically cleaves neddylated substrates, promoted the deneddylation of TAp73. Importantly, an intact NEDD8 pathway attenuated TAp73 transcriptional activity in ts41 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and Mdm2 promoted preferential cytoplasmic localization of NEDD8-TAp73. Taken together, our findings provide a mechanistic insight into Mdm2-mediated NEDD8-dependent regulation of TAp73. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first evidence of p73 regulation via covalent post-translational modification exclusively targeting the TAp73 isoform. Cells—HEK293 human embryonic kidney and SAOS-2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells growing in monolayers were removed from 10 cm tissue culture plates by scraping and collected by centrifugation. The cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 10% phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 90% lysis buffer (pH 7.35) (20 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm iodoacetamide) containing 1% SDS and supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). The samples were incubated at 100 °C for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford method and whole cell lysates were diluted 10 times with lysis buffer without SDS in preparation for the immunoprecipitation procedure. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting procedures were performed as described previously (3Marin M.C. Jost C. Irwin M.S. DeCaprio J.A. Caput D. Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6316-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitations were carried out with the indicated antibody for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with NETN buffer (2 m Tris (pH 8.0), 5 m NaCl, 0.5 m EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40) eluted by boiling in SDS-containing buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) for Western analysis. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were trypsinized, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm at 4 °C for 3 min. Cells were resuspended in 250 μl of lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Following a 7-min incubation on ice, the nuclear fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 3600 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cytoplasmic cell fraction was decanted. The nuclear pellet was washed once with buffer A without Triton X-100. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer B (0.2 mm EGTA (pH 8), 3 mm EDTA (pH 8), 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 30 min while undergoing periodic vortexing. The nuclear fraction was collected following centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford method, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay—The ts41 and wild type CHO cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) with 20 ng of pcDNA3-HA-TAp73β or pcDNA3-p53, 20 ng of either PG-13- or p21-luciferase reporter construct, and 0.1 ng of Renilla luciferase construct. In cases where APP-BP1 and TAp73β were co-expressed in the ts41 cells, 10 ng of pcDNA3-HA-TAp73β was co-transfected with either 50, 100, or 150 ng of pcDNA3-myc-APP-BP1. Following transfection, cells were incubated overnight at 33 °C and were maintained either at 33 °C or shifted to 39 °C for an additional 24 h. SAOS-2 cells were similarly transfected with 20 ng of pcDNA3-HA-TAp73α or HA-TAp73β in combination with 80 ng of pCMV-Hdm2 and 100 ng of pcDNA3-T7-NEDD8 where indicated, followed by an incubation period of 48 h at 37 °C. The total amount of transfected DNA was equilibrated to 200 ng using an empty pcDNA3 plasmid. Luciferase and Renilla activities were measured using Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies). TAp73β Is Modified by NEDD8 via Mdm2—Mdm2 promotes NEDD8 conjugation of p53 to negatively regulate its transcriptional activity (27Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.C. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 83-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). We asked whether p73 is subjected to a similar NEDD8-dependent regulation mediated by Mdm2. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding HA-TAp73β in combination with plasmids encoding T7-NEDD8 and human Mdm2 (Hdm2). Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, bound proteins resolved on SDS-PAGE, and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-HA (Fig. 1A, left panel) and anti-T7 (right panel) antibodies. Slower co-migrating HA-TAp73β proteins were readily detectable in cells transfected with plasmids encoding HA-TAp73β, T7-NEDD8, and Hdm2 (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 4 and 9). These modified HA-TAp73β proteins were absent in cells transfected with plasmids encoding HA-TAp73β alone (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 7). As expected, co-expression of Hdm2 and T7-NEDD8 in the absence of HA-TAp73β did not generate modified HA-TAp73β proteins (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 10). Therefore, the slower migrating forms of TAp73β contain both HA and T7 epitopes, suggesting that T7-NEDD8 covalently conjugates to HA-TAp73β. Notably, in the absence of exogenous Hdm2, ectopic co-expression of HA-TAp73β and T7-NEDD8 generated similar slower co-migrating HA-TAp73β (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 8 and 9 under dark exposure). In a reciprocal experiment, anti-T7 immunoprecipitation was performed followed by anti-HA Western analysis (Fig. 1B, right panel). Again, slower migrating TAp73β species containing both HA and T7 epitopes were observed, supporting the notion that HA-TAp73β is modified by T7-NEDD8 (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 9). Similar observations were made in the context of HA-TAp73α (data not shown). To further confirm that the modified TAp73β is conjugated by NEDD8, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding HA-TAp73β in combination with T7-NEDD8 and Hdm2. Cells were then lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, bound proteins separated on SDS-PAGE, and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-HA (Fig. 1C, left panel) and anti-NEDD8 (right panel) antibodies. Similar slower migrating HA-TAp73β species containing both HA and NEDD8 epitopes were observed (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 14; compare with Fig. 1A). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Mdm2 promotes TAp73β covalent modification by NEDD8. NEDP1 Deneddylates Modified TAp73β—NEDP1 is a cysteine protease that specifically cleaves NEDD8 conjugates on cullins, which are the scaffold components of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (44Mendoza H.M. Shen L.N. Botting C. Lewis A. Chen J. Ink B. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25637-25643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, NEDP1, but not other UBL deconjugating enzymes (e.g. SUMO-deconjugating enzyme SSP3), was shown to specifically deneddylate NEDD8-modified p53 (27Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.C. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 83-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In a complementary experiment, we asked whether the physiologically relevant NEDD8-deconjugating enzyme NEDP1 could curtail NEDD8-modification of TAp73β. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-TAp73β, Hdm2, T7-NEDD8 or conjugation-defective T7-NEDD8ΔGG, and NEDP1 or inactive NEDP1(C163A) mutant (Fig. 2). As previously shown in Fig. 1, HA-TAp73β was modified by T7-NEDD8 in the presence of Hdm2 (Fig. 2, lane 3). However, co-expression of NEDP1, but not the non-functional NEDP1(C163A) mutant, dramatically reduced the level of T7-NEDD8-modified HA-TAp73β (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5). In addition, ectopic expression of T7-NEDD8ΔGG, which lacks the essential C-terminal glycineglycine residues required for the formation of the isopeptide bond, resulted in the loss of the modified HA-TAp73β (Fig. 2, lane 6). Taken together, these results suggest TAp73β is specifically modified by NEDD8 and deconjugated by NEDP1. ΔNp73β Does Not Undergo Mdm2-mediated Neddylation—Mdm2 binds to the hydrophobic stretch (16QPTFSDYWKLLP27) within the N terminus of p53. In particular, Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26 residues make direct contact with and are indispensable for binding to Mdm2 (46Bottger A. Bottger V. Garcia-Echeverria C. Chene P. Hochkeppel H.K. Sampson W. Ang K. Howard S.F. Picksley S.M. Lane D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 744-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 47Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). These critical Mdm2-binding residues are conserved in the N terminus of TA isoforms of p73 (2Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the ΔNp73β that lacks the Mdm2-binding motif is capable of being modified by NEDD8. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding TAp73β or ΔNp73β in combination with T7-NEDD8 and Hdm2. Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with an anti-p73 (ER15) antibody, and immunoblotted with anti-p73β (GC15) (Fig. 3, left panel) or anti-NEDD8 (right panel) antibodies. While TAp73β was neddylated (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 11), there was no detectable NEDD8 conjugation to the ΔNp73β isoform (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 14). These results suggest that Mdm2-mediated neddylation of TAp73 is dependent on its N terminus. Neddylation of p73 Occurs under Physiological Conditions—We next asked whether neddylation of p73 occurs in the absence of overexpression. HEK293 cells were lysed under denaturing conditions, immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-p73 (2301) antibody or a control antibody and immunoblotted with anti-p73 (Fig. 4, left panel) and anti-NEDD8 (right panel) antibodies. As expected, multiple endogenous p73 proteins were observed, indicating the presence of various N- and C-terminal p73 isoforms (Fig. 4, lane 1). Importantly, a co-migrating protein containing both p73- and NEDD8-specific epitopes was observed (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 3). Similar results were observed using an anti-p73 antibody generated against the N terminus of TAp73 (H-79, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that, in agreement with the above overexpression data, the modified forms of p73 are most likely the full-length TA isoforms. In addition, a reciprocal immunoprecipitation using anti-NEDD8 antibody followed by an anti-p73 immunoblot showed a single protein species exhibiting both NEDD8 and p73 epitopes (data not shown). Under physiologic conditions, unlike in the case of overexpression, a single slower migrating p73 protein containing NEDD8 was consistently observed. While the reason for this discrepancy is undetermined, it is likely due to the variations in the stoichiometry of the various components of the NEDD8 pathway, Hdm2 and p73 between experiments conducted under physiologic conditions and overexpression. The Neddylation Pathway Attenuates TAp73β Transcriptional Activity—Our results show that Mdm2 promotes NEDD8 modification of TAp73β. To address the functional significance of TAp73β neddylation, we used a well characterized ts41 CHO cell line with a temperature-sensitive mutation in the SMC gene (the hamster homologue of human APP-BP1, a component of the E1 NEDD8-activating enzyme), to determine whether an intact NEDD8 pathway affects TAp73β transcriptional activity (41Hirschberg J. Marcus M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 113: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ts41 CHO cells were transfected with either p53 or HA-TAp73β with a PG-1"
https://openalex.org/W2110283088,"The extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 4 (MAPK4) and ERK3 (MAPK6) are structurally related atypical MAPKs displaying major differences only in the C-terminal extension. ERK3 is known as an unstable mostly cytoplasmic protein that binds, translocates, and activates the MAPK-activated protein kinase (MK) 5. Here we have investigated the stability and expression of ERK4 and have analyzed its ability to bind, translocate, and activate MK5. We show that, in contrast to ERK3, ERK4 is a stable protein that binds to endogenous MK5. Interaction of ERK4 with MK5 leads to translocation of MK5 to the cytoplasm and to its activation by phosphorylation. In transfected HEK293 cells, where overexpressed catalytically dead ERK3 is able to activate MK5, catalytic activity of ERK4 is necessary for activation of MK5, indicating that ERK4 directly phosphorylates MK5. Interestingly, ERK4 dimerizes and/or oligomerizes with ERK3, suggesting that overexpressed inactive ERK3 recruits active endogenous ERK4 to MK5 for its activation. Hence, ERK3 and ERK4 cooperate in activation of MK5."
https://openalex.org/W2170299197,"The ING4 gene is a candidate tumor suppressor gene that functions in cell proliferation, contact inhibition, and angiogenesis. We identified three novel splice variants of ING4 with differing activities in controlling cell proliferation, cell spreading, and cell migration. ING4_v1 (the longest splice variant), originally identified as ING4, encodes an intact nuclear localization signal (NLS), whereas the other three splice variants (ING4_v2, ING4_v3, and ING4_v4) lack the full NLS, resulting in increased cytoplasmic localization of these proteins. We found that one of the three ING4 variants, ING4_v2, is expressed at the same level as the original ING4 (ING4_v1), suggesting that ING4 variants may have significant biological functions. Growth suppressive effects of the variants that have a partial NLS (ING4_v2 and ING4_v4) were attenuated by a weaker effect of the variants on p21WAF1 promoter activation. ING4_v4 lost cell spreading and migration suppressive effects; on the other hand, ING4_v2 retained a cell migration suppressive effect but lost a cell spreading suppressive effect. Therefore, ING4_v2, which localized primarily into cytoplasm, might have an important role in the regulation of cell migration. We also found that ING4_v4 played dominant-negative roles in the induction of p21WAF1 promoter activation and in the suppression of cell motility by ING4_v1. In addition, ING4 variants had different binding affinities to two cytoplasmic proteins, protein-tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, f polypeptide (PTPRF), interacting protein (liprin), α1, and G3BP2a. Understanding the functions of the four splice variants may aid in defining their roles in human carcinogenesis.

More recently, it was reported that ING4 acetylates histone H4 lysine 5, 8, and 12 with a histone acetyltransferase, HBO1/MYST2 (MYST2 is MOZ, YBF2/SAS3, SAS2 and TIP60 histone acetyltransferase 2) (9Doyon Y.

Nature. 2006; 442: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Thus, ING4 seems to play several major roles in cells like other ING family proteins (11Gong W. Suzuki K. Russell M. Riabowol K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1054-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that are conserved from yeasts to vertebrates (12He G.H. Helbing C.C. Wagner M.J. Sensen C.W. Riabowol K. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe three novel splice variants of ING4, ING4_v2 (a 3-bp skip form), ING4_v3 (a 9-bp skip form), and ING4_v4 (a 12-bp skip form), besides ING4_v1 (the originally enrolled ING4, the longest form). These variants are produced from the alternative use of two splice donor sites at the end of exon 4 and two splice acceptor sites at the start of exon 5 of the ING4 gene, although one of the three variants, ING4_v4, was previously attributed to a common deletion mutation (6Kim S. Chin K. Gray J.W. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16251-16256Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The alternative RNA splicing of the ING4 pre-mRNA causes a partial loss of an NLS and affects nuclear localization of the proteins. We show that the small deletion in the ING4 protein leads to functional differences between the ING4 variants. Growth suppressive effects of the variants that have the partially missing NLS were attenuated by weaker activity on p21WAF1 induction. In addition, ING4_v4 showed attenuated suppressive effects on cell spreading and migration compared with the original ING4 (ING4_v1). On the other hand, ING4_v2 only lost the suppressive effect on cell spreading, suggesting an important role for ING4_v2 on the regulation of cell migration. ING4_v4 played dominant-negative roles on these ING4_v1 effects. In addition, we found that ING4_v1 and ING4_v2, but not ING4_v4, have a binding affinity to Liprin α1 that may play a role in the regulation of focal adhesion disassembly (13Serra-Pages C. Streuli M.

Biol. 2005; 15: 684-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, only ING_v1 has a binding affinity to G3BP2a, which is involved in Ras signaling, NF-κB signaling, and the ubiquitin proteasome system (15Prigent M. Barlat I. Langen H. Dargemont C. J.

These differences may affect the function of ING4 splice variants. Tissues and Cell Lines—cDNA from various tissues (Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panels 1 and 2) were obtained from BD Biosciences. RKO, U-118 MG, M059K, DBTRG-05MG, NCI-H82, A549, LNCap.FGC, PC-3, SW480, HCT 116, 293, 293T, U-2 0S, and MRC-5 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were grown as a monolayer in appropriate media, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, as follows: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for RKO, U-118 MG, M059K, 293, 293T, U-2 0S, and MRC-5 cells; Eagle's minimal essential medium for DBTRG-05MG; RPMI 1640 for A549 and NCI-H82, LNCap.FGC; F12 medium for PC-3; McCoy's 5a medium for HCT 116; and Leibovitz's L-15 medium for SW480. Construction of Minigene Plasmids—All sequences for cloning were amplified by PCR using KOD-Plus (Novagen, Madison, WI) and verified by DNA sequencing. A partial ING4 gene from exon 3 to exon 6 and its point mutants were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 (+) (Invitrogen) using the HindIII and XbaI site. Expression plasmids for two major ING4 splice variants (ING4_v2 and ING4_v4) were derived from the original ING4 plasmid (pFLAG-CMV-2 and pcDNA3.1/Hygro) as a template. Transfection of Plasmids and Isolation of RNA—The plasmids were transfected into cells by Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were harvested, and total RNAs were isolated from the cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Then 5-10 μg of the total RNAs were reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Separation of Each ING4 Variant by PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism —The transcribed artificial cDNAs from the series of minigenes were amplified using a forward primer at a vector-specific region (T7 promoter) between the transcriptional starting site and exon 3 of ING4 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) and a reverse primer at exon 5 of ING4 (5′-ACTTCTTCTGGGCAGTCTTG-3′). A nested PCR was performed on the first PCR using a forward primer at exon 4 (5′-ACAAACACATTCGGCGGCTG-3′), combined with a reverse primer at exon 5 (5′-ACTTCTTCTGGGCAGTCTTG-3′). One μl of the gel-purified first PCR product was used as a nested PCR template. The nested PCR product was digested by HaeIII (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), separated by 9% polyacrylamide gel (AccuGel 19:1, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), and stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Real Time PCR Analysis—Total ING4 was detected using variant common primers (5′-CCGGACTCAAAAGGAGAA-3′ and 5′-GAGGGGCATCCCATACTCAGGA-3′) and a variant common probe (5′-FAM-TCGGATGAAGAAGCCCCCAAGACTG-TAMRA-3′). For specific detection of ING4_v1, a variant-specific forward primer (5′-CCAGCAAAGGCAAAAAGAAAGG-3′), a variant common reverse primer (5′-GAGGGGCATCCCATACTCAGGA-3′), and a variant common probe (5′-FAM-TCGGATGAAGAAGCCCCCAAGACTGTAMRA-3′) were designed. For specific detection of ING4_v2,a variant common forward primer an ING4_v2-specific reverse primer (5′-TTCTCCTTTTGAGTCCGGCTCT-3′), and an ING4_v1-and ING4_v2-specific probe (5′-FAM-ATGACAGCTCTTCCAGCAAAGGCAAAA-TAMRA-3′) were designed. For specific detection of ING4_v3 and ING4_v4, variant-specific probes (ING4_v3: 5′-FAM-TCCAGCAAAGAAGGCCGGACTCA-TAMRA-3′ and ING4_v4:5′-FAM-TCTTCCAGCAAAGGCCGGACTCA-TAMRA-3′), a variant common forward primer (5′-AGGAGAAACAGATTGAGTCAAGTGACTATG-3′), and a variant common reverse primer (5′-TTTGGAACGAGCACGAGCAG-3′) were designed. The variant-specific PCR products were continuously measured by means of an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) during 40 cycles. The annealing temperature was modified for each variant-specific amplification (ING4_v1 and ING4_v3, 64 °C; ING4_v2 and ING4_v4, 66 °C). β2-Microglobulin RNA was used for normalization using pre-developed TaqMan assay reagent (4310886E; Applied Biosystems). The annealing temperature for the amplification of total ING4 and B2M was 60 °C. Western Blotting—Plasmid constructs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with Proteinase Mixture Set III (Calbiochem), and sonicated. The extracted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The FLAG-tagged proteins were detected by anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Fractionation of Proteins—Cells were transfected with different plasmids that express FLAG-tagged ING4_v1, ING4_v2, and ING4_v4. 24 h after transfection, the cellular proteins were fractionated by the nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA) and the same amount of proteins from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was applied into a gel. Immunoblotting was performed by a standard protocol. FLAG-tagged proteins were detected by anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Fractionation was evaluated by a nuclear marker, anti-Lamin A/C antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay—Cells were cultured on coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with different untagged ING4 plasmid constructs using Lipofectamine Reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-ING4 antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA), followed by a secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Then the slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) containing 1.5 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The fluorescent images were obtained using a fluorescent microscope (Axioplan 2 imaging; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Colony Formation Assay—Three cancer cell lines, RKO, U-118 MG, and U-2 OS were used for the experiments. Cells were plated on 10-cm dishes (5 × 105 cells/dish), cultured for 12 h at 37 °C, and then transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1/Hygro (5.6 kb) as a control, and 5.7 μg of pcDNA3.1/Hygro-ING4_v1 (6.35 kb), pcDNA3.1/Hygro-ING4_v2 (6.35 kb), and pcDNA3.1/Hygro-ING4_v4 (6.35 kb). Cells were cultured in the selection medium (hygromycin B; Invitrogen) as follows: 100 μg/ml for U-118 MG, 200 μg/ml for U-2 OS, and 300 μg/ml for RKO. After a 2-week selection, cells were fixed on the plates with 4% formaldehyde (Sigma) and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma). The area of the colonies (pixels) in each dish was calculated by Photoshop CS (Adobe, San Jose, CA). The data are shown as the average and standard deviation of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out by both Scheffé's F test and Student's t test. Reporter Gene Assay—Cells were plated into 12-well plates and transfected with 0.1 μg of pEYFP-Nuc that encodes the enhanced yellow-green variant of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein gene (BD Biosciences) and with 0.5 μg of WWW-Luc-p21 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and with the indicated amount of pcDNA3.1/Hygro empty vector, pcDNA3.1/Hygro-ING4_v1, pcDNA3.1/Hygro-ING4_v2, or pcDNA3.1/Hygro-ING4_v4. The cells were lysed in cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, WI), and the lysates were collected to measure the p21WAF1 promoter activity 48 h after transfection. The transcriptional efficiency was examined by detecting a signal from enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (the fluorescence excitation maximum is 513 nm and the peak of the emission spectrum is 527 nm), and the promoter activity (the peak of the emission spectrum of luciferase is 562 nm) was examined by the Bright-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega). The activities of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein and luciferase were quantified with an FLX800 microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Cell Spreading Assay—RKO cells transiently transfected with ING4 expression plasmids were plated on glass coverslips in medium depleted of serum. Following overnight adherence at 37 °C, the starved cells were stimulated with 5% fetal bovine serum to observe the cellular response in membrane spreading. At designated time points, cells were fixed and stained on F-actin by rhodamine-phalloidin. Quantitative data of cell spreading, the percent of the cells that have filopodia and/or lamellipodia (% S), were derived from the equation % S = (S/T) × 100%, where S is the number of cells containing filo/lamellipodia, and T is the total number of cells counted. Modified Boyden Chamber Migration Assay—RKO cells transiently transfected with ING4 expression plasmids were subjected to a transmembrane cell migration assay containing 8 μm pore size polystyrene membranes coated with FluoroBlok materials in the migration chamber (BD Biosciences). By following the manufacturer's protocol, the transverse cells were stained with calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the lower chamber, and the magnitude of activated fluorescence was read by fluorescence spectrometry (Victor II; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were transfected with different plasmid vectors that express FLAG-tagged or untagged ING4_v1, ING4_v2, or ING4_v4, and a plasmid that expresses FLAG-tagged G3BP2a that was a generous gift from Dr. Derek Kennedy (University of Queensland, Australia). 24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40-based lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and protease inhibitor mixture; Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitation was performed using FLAG M2 resin (Sigma). Each precipitate was washed, and proteins were eluted in sample buffer. Immunoblotting was performed by standard protocols. FLAG-tagged ING4_v1, ING4_v2, ING4_v4, and G3BP2a were detected by rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Liprin α1 was detected by chicken anti-liprin α1 antibody (Genway, San Diego, CA). Untagged ING4_v1, ING4_v2, and ING4_v4 were detected by anti-ING4 antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Identification of ING4 Variants by EST Search—We identified three novel ING4 variants, ING4_v2, ING4_v3, and ING4_v4 (Fig. 1A, DDBJ accession numbers are AB197695, AB197696, and AB197697, respectively) by EST search using the BLAST program (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The originally enrolled ING4 is ING4_v1 (DDBJ accession number AF156552). The expression composition of the variants enrolled as EST fragments (ING4_v1, 34%; ING4_v2, 49%; ING4_v3, 2%; and ING4_v4, 13%) was almost the same as a normal fibroblast cell line, MRC-5, and a cancer cell line, H82, by reverse transcription-PCR and subsequent TA cloning and sequencing (data not shown). ING4_v1 (original ING4) and ING4_v2 were expressed at a high level with a similar ratio (both variants were expressed around 40-50% among the four variants), whereas the ratio of ING4_v4 and ING4_v3 was ∼10% and less than 10%, respectively. Because ING4_v4 was reported previously as a 12-bp common deletion mutation (6Kim S. Chin K. Gray J.W. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16251-16256Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we examined the genomic DNA sequence of the ING4 gene in H82 that was reported to have a mutation (6Kim S. Chin K. Gray J.W. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16251-16256Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and did not detect any mutations or polymorphisms (data not shown). These variations occurred only at the cDNA level, suggesting they were presumably splicing variants. Determination of Alternative Usage of Splice Donor and Acceptor Sites for the Production of the Splice Variants by Minigene Experiment—To prove our assumption, we analyzed the ING4 gene sequence and identified two potential alternative splice donor sites, D1 and D2, at the end of exon 4 and two potential alternative splice acceptor sites, A1 and A2, at the start of exon 5 (Fig. 1A). The consensus sequences for the splice donor and acceptor sites are MAGGTRAGT and YYYYYYYY-NCAGR, respectively. D1 (AAGGCAAAA) matched 67% with the consensus sequence, whereas D2 (AAG-A-GTGAGG) matched 89% with the consensus sequence but includes an extra “A” base between MAG and GTRAGT. A1 (CCTCTTCCCTAGA) matched 92% with the consensus sequence, whereas A2 (CTTCCCTAGAAGG) matched 85% with the consensus sequence. It was predicted that ING4_v1 might be a spliced product from D1 to A1, and ING4_v2, ING4_v3, and ING4_v4 might be the spliced products from D1 to A2, D2 to A1, and D2 to A2, respectively. To prove usage of the potential splice sites, a “minigene” approach was utilized (Fig. 1B). The plasmid contains a partial ING4 gene from exon 3 to exon 6, including the introns, a TATA box, a transcriptional starting site, and a T7 promoter just before ING4 exon 3, and a poly(A) signal just after ING4 exon 6. The expected artificial pre-mRNA should undergo alternative RNA splicing with cellular splicing machinery. Along with the wild-type minigene, we also constructed five mutant minigenes with a destroyed D1, D2, or A2 site or a combination of D1A2 and D2A2 site mutations to examine the usage of each splice site. Each minigene was transfected into cells, and total RNA was extracted from the cells 24 h after transfection for cDNA preparation by reverse transcription. We amplified the artificial cDNAs from the minigenes using a forward primer at the T7 promoter (vector specific region) and a reverse primer at exon 5 of ING4 (Fig. 1B), and reamplified it by a nested PCR using a forward primer at exon 4 and the same reverse primer. Subsequent HaeIII digestion of the nested PCR products allowed us to distinguish each variant by electrophoresis. The HaeIII restriction enzyme that recognizes the GGCC sequence creates an 82-bp fragment specific for ING4_v1, a 167-bp fragment specific for ING4_v2, a 73-bp fragment for ING4_v3, and a 70-bp fragment for ING4_v4 (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows the result of the minigene experiment. For positive controls, each variant-containing plasmid was used (Fig. 1C, lane 1-4). All four variants were made by alternative splicing from the wild-type minigene of ING4 (Fig. 1C, lane 5). As predicted, only ING4_v3 and ING4_v4 were generated from the D1 mutant (Fig. 1C, lane 6). ING4_v1 and ING4_v3 were generated from the A2 mutant (Fig. 1C, lane 7). ING4_v1 and ING4_v2 were generated from the D2 mutant (Fig. 1C, lane 8). Only ING4_v3 (Fig. 1C, lane 9) and ING4_v1 (lane 10) were generated from the D1A2 mutant and D2A2 mutant, respectively. This result clearly shows the alternative usage of two splice donor and acceptor sites. ING4_v4 (the 12-bp skip type) was attributed to a common deletion mutation at 379-390 (6Kim S. Chin K. Gray J.W. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16251-16256Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), although we show here that the skip region of ING4_v4 is 383-394. The variation is the result from an AAAG sequence duplication of 379-382 and 391-394, and 391-394 is correct. Our data indicate that it is one of the three novel splice variants derived by RNA splicing from D2 to A2 (Fig. 1A). Expression Level of the ING4 Variants in Various Tissues—Although it was reported that ING4 expression is ubiquitous in various tissues (2Garkavtsev I. Kozin S.V. Chernova O. Xu L. Winkler F. Brown E. Barnett G.H. Jain R.K. Nature. 2004; 428: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), the expression levels of each of the ING4 variants have not been examined. Therefore, we designed variant-specific TaqMan primer and probe sets along with a variant-nonspecific primer and probe set. First, a suitable annealing temperature for the specific amplification of each variant was determined (supplemental Fig. S1). Then the expression level of the total and each splice variant was examined. The variants were expressed ubiquitously among all tissues and cell lines we examined (supplemental Fig. S2). The expression pattern of all the variants was similar. We did not observe the expression of each variant in specific tissues or cell lines. Among the tissues that we examined, all the variants were expressed at the highest level in the brain and testis, and the next highest level in the pancreas. In the other tissues, all variants were expressed at lower levels. Among the cell lines that we examined, all the variants were expressed at the highest levels in a glioblastoma cell line, M059K, and embryonic kidney cell lines 293 and 293T. In the rest of the cell lines, all variants were expressed at lower levels. Subcellular Localization of the ING4 Variants—So far, several putative motifs, a coiled-coil domain, two NLSs, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane retention signal, and a PHD finger motif were predicted by computer searches (supplemental Fig. S3A, PSORT II Prediction and SMART). The variations of the three novel ING4 variants were located at just one of the predicted NLSs (NLS1). Because two NLSs were predicted by the computer search (PSORT II Prediction), we examined whether the predicted NLSs were functional. One study reported that NLS1 is a functional NLS (4Zhang X. Wang K.S. Wang Z.Q. Xu L.S. Wang Q.W. Chen F. Wei D.Z. Han Z.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that NLS2 might also function as an NLS. We constructed FLAG-tagged NLS1, NLS2, and NLS1 + NLS2 deletion mutants (FLAG-ΔNLS1, FLAG-ΔNLS2, and FLAG-ΔNLS1 + 2; supplemental Fig. S3B). The expression of the mutant proteins was first determined with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S3C), and their subcellular localization was then examined by indirect immunofluorescence using the same antibody. The deletion of the NLS2 region did not affect nuclear localization of ING4, although NLS2 might alter the distribution of ING4 in the nucleus (supplemental Fig. S3D). These results indicate that NLS1 is the only ING4 NLS and suggest that sequence variations at the NLS1 region because of alternative RNA splicing could affect the localization of ING4 variants. Subsequently, we examined the subcellular localization of two major ING4 variants, ING4_v2 (K131S,G132Δ) and ING4_v4 (129KKKG132 ΔΔΔΔ). Although the two variants were expressed equally well by Western blotting assays (Fig. 2A), they, especially ING4_v4, were localized primarily in the cytoplasm with a lesser amount in the nucleus (Fig. 2, B-D). This observation is consistent with a reported study that ING4 contained NLS deletion (ING4ΔNLS) exhibited primarily in the cytoplasm (4Zhang X. Wang K.S. Wang Z.Q. Xu L.S. Wang Q.W. Chen F. Wei D.Z. Han Z.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results suggest a different role for the variants in cells through different localization. Attenuated Growth Suppression of ING4 Variants—The overexpression of ING4 variants was conducted using two p53 wild-type cancer cell lines, U-2 OS and RKO, and a p53-mutated cell line, U-118 MG. We confirmed equal expression levels of all of the splice variants by Western blotting (data not shown). Cell growth was suppressed by ING4_v1 effectively in all cell lines we examined, but the variants, ING4_v2 and ING4_v4, that have a partial NLS were less effective (Fig. 3, A and B). We did not observe a significant p53 dependence. The ING4 variant effects on the p21WAF1 promoter were further examined by a reporter assay. Fig. 4A shows that ING4_v1 overexpression could activate the p21WAF1 promoter (1.5-fold when compared with the vector control), but both ING4_v2 and ING4_v4 were weaker inducers (1.2- and 0.8-fold when compared with the vector control, respectively). Equal expression levels of all of the splice variants were confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). In addition, we found ING4_v4 could block ING4_v1-mediated p21WAF1 induction (Fig. 4B), suggesting a dominant-negative effect of ING4_v4 on ING4_v1.FIGURE 4The attenuated effect of p21WAF1 induction of the ING4 variants that have a partial NLS. A, the reporter assay was performed using U-2 OS cells. ING4_v1 induced p21WAF1 promoter activity modestly but significantly; on the o"
https://openalex.org/W2037289712,"The AGCVIIIa kinases of Arabidopsis are members of the eukaryotic PKA, PKG, and PKC group of regulatory kinases. One AGCVIIIa kinase, PINOID (PID), plays a fundamental role in the asymmetrical localization of membrane proteins during polar auxin transport. The remaining 16 AGCVIIIa genes have not been associated with single mutant phenotypes, suggesting that the corresponding kinases function redundantly. Consistent with this idea, we find that the genes encoding the Arabidopsis AGCVIIIa kinases have spatially distinct, but overlapping, expression domains. Here we show that the majority of Arabidopsis AGCVIIIa kinases are substrates for the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and that trans-phosphorylation by PDK1 correlates with activation of substrate AGCVIIIa kinases. Mutational analysis of two conserved regulatory domains was used to demonstrate that sequences located outside of the C-terminal PDK1 interaction (PIF) domain and the activation loop are required for functional interactions between PDK1 and its substrates. A subset of GFP-tagged AGCVIIIa kinases expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and tobacco BY-2 cells were preferentially localized to the cytoplasm (AGC1-7), nucleus (WAG1 and KIPK), and the cell periphery (PID). We present evidence that PID insertion domain sequences are sufficient to direct the observed peripheral localization. We find that PID specifically but non-selectively binds to phosphoinositides and phosphatidic acid, suggesting that PID might directly interact with the plasma membrane through protein-lipid interactions. The initial characterization of the AGCVIIIa kinases presented here provides a framework for elucidating the physiological roles of these kinases in planta.

The initial characterization of the AGCVIIIa kinases presented here provides a framework for elucidating the physiological roles of these kinases in planta. Postembryonic plant development is coordinated through the integration of environmental signals with those derived from intrinsic plant growth regulators. Because the plant cell wall inhibits cell motility and prevents direct cell-to-cell contact, the transmission of information between cells relies largely on the activation of an impressive array of intercellular signaling machinery. The completed sequence of the model organism Arabidopsis has revealed that roughly 10% of the genome is devoted to signaling-related genes (1The Arabidopsis Genome InitiativeNature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7085) Google Scholar). Included in this sector are the more than 1,000 annotated genes predicted to encode serine-threonine protein kinases, nearly double the number found in the genomes of representative metazoan organisms (2Champion A. Kreis M. Mockaitis K. Picaud A. Henry Y. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2004; 4: 163-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One mechanism for the observed expansion of kinases into larger gene families in plants as compared with animals or fungi is the amplification of low copy number genes into larger gene families, which may perform divergent or stage- and tissuespecific functions (3Force A. Lynch M. Pickett F.B. Amores A. Yan Y.-L. Postlethwait J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1531-1545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major challenge of post-genomic Arabidopsis research will be to understand the extent to which duplicated genes retain ancestral function or are conscripted by other signaling networks to regulate disparate cellular processes. One example of a gene family that has undergone expansion in plants, is the AGC family of serine-threonine protein kinases. In yeast and mammals, these kinases have been implicated in the regulation of transcription, apoptosis, cell proliferation, insulin signaling, and cytoskeletal remodeling (4Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 5Dong L.Q. Landa L.R. Wick M.J. Zhu L. Mukai H. Ono Y. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite the breadth of cellular processes controlled by these proteins, numerous studies suggest that phosphorylation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), 4The abbreviations used are: PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase; PID, PINOID; PIF, PDK1-interacting fragment; GST, glutathione S-transferase; His, polyhistidine; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PID-ID, PINOID insertion domain; MBP, myelin basic protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase.4The abbreviations used are: PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase; PID, PINOID; PIF, PDK1-interacting fragment; GST, glutathione S-transferase; His, polyhistidine; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PID-ID, PINOID insertion domain; MBP, myelin basic protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. itself an AGC kinase, is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulation of AGC kinase activity (9Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In contrast to the detailed information available for their yeast and metazoan counterparts, the signaling processes associated with AGC kinase activity in plants, and the mechanisms by which kinase activity is regulated, remain poorly characterized. The 39 identified Arabidopsis AGC protein kinases can be phylogenetically grouped into five distinct subfamilies (10Bögre L. Okresz L. Henriques R. Anthony R.G. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 424-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The AGCVI subfamily includes two S6K homologues that have been shown to respond to regulation by phytohormones (11Turck F. Zilbermann F. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nagy F. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1527-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The AGCVII class contains eight uncharacterized homologues of the nuclear Dbf2-related kinases (12Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S. Hemmings B.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The AGC “other” subfamily consists of four genes related to INCOMPLETE ROOT HAIR ELONGATION, which is involved in the modulation of root hair growth (13Oyama T. Shimura Y. Okada K. Plant J. 2002; 30: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The two PDK1 homologues of Arabidopsis cluster together in a separate subfamily. The largest and most diverse kinase class is subfamily VIII, which contains 23 members. The AGCVIII kinases represent a plant-specific subfamily identified by two signature domains; a conserved DFD motif implicated in the coordinate binding of Mg2+-ATP, and the presence of a small region of variable sequence inserted between catalytic subdomains VII and VIII (14Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Bögre et al. (10Bögre L. Okresz L. Henriques R. Anthony R.G. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 424-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have further subdivided the AGC VIII subfamily into two classes, VIIIa and VIIIb containing 17 and 6 members, respectively. Three AGC kinases belonging to subgroup VIIIb have been genetically and biochemically characterized in Arabidopsis. The PHOT1 and PHOT2 blue-light photoreceptors contain LOV domains that respond to light and induce a conformational change that activates the kinase domain (15Sakai T. Kagawa T. Kasahara M. Swartz T.E. Christie J.M. Briggs W.R. Wada M. Okada K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6969-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 16Briggs W.R. Christie J.M. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 204-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The third kinase, AGC2-1/OXI1, first identified through its interaction with PDK1, is involved in root hair growth and is activated in response to wounding and pathogen infection (17Anthony R.G. Henriques R. Helfer A. Meszaros T. Rios G. Testerink C. Munnik T. Deak M. Koncz C. Bogre L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 572-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 18Rentel M.C. Lecourieux D. Ouaked F.

Within the VIIIa subgroup, only PINOID (PID) has been identified genetically, and was subsequently shown to play a fundamental role in the asymmetrical localization of auxin transport proteins at the cell membrane (19Bennett S.R.M. Alvarez J. Bossinger G. Smyth D.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 505-520Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 20Christensen S.K. Degenais N. Chory J. Weigel D.

Palme K. Offringa R. Science. 2004; 306: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). A second AGCVIIIa kinase, KIPK, was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the kinesin-like motor KCBP (23Day I.S. Miller C. Golovkin M. Reddy A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13737-13745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although the significance of this interaction is still unclear. More recently, two other kinases of this class, WAG1 and WAG2 were identified in Arabidopsis based on their homology to the light responsive pea gene PsPK3, and have now been shown to redundantly regulate root waving in response to tactile stimulus (24Santner A.A. Watson J.C. Plant J. 2006; 45: 752-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). With the exception of PID, genetic screens have thus far failed to identify additional mutant phenotypes associated with disruption of AGCVIIIa gene function. Furthermore, while 10 of the 16 genes encoding AGCVIIIa kinases have been identified as carrying insertions within coding regions, plant lines corresponding to the insertion alleles do not have obvious morphological defects. The simplest explanation for these observations is that, like WAG1 and WAG2, the majority of these proteins are likely to exhibit partial or complete functional redundancy. As a first step toward elucidating those processes that are controlled by these kinases, we have initiated the characterization of the AGCVIIIa subfamily in Arabidopsis. Specifically, we have examined gene expression patterns, posttranslational activation, and subcellular localization of the corresponding proteins. AGC Gene Expression Analysis by RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using 100 mg of plant tissue according to the manufacturer's protocol. After elution, the RNA was treated for 1 h with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI), phenol-chloroform extracted and precipitated. For all RNA samples, the absence of contaminating DNA was confirmed by PCR amplification using the same primers that were used in the RT-PCR analysis. 20 μl of reverse transcription reactions were performed using the RT system (Promega). Total RNA (1 μg) was used as template for the AMV reverse transcriptase in the presence of 0.5 μg of oligo (dT)15 primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. After first-strand synthesis, the resulting cDNAs were diluted 10-fold, and 10 μl of the diluted solution was used as a PCR template. PCR was carried out in 50-μl reactions using 1 μm of each primer in the presence of 400 μm dNTPs and Taq Polymerase (Promega). Primers for the ubiquitin (UBI) control were added to the reaction tubes prior to the final 24 amplification cycles. All cycles were run at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 40 s. PCR products were separated on a 1.4% agarose gel. Primer sequences used in this study are available upon request. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins in Bacteria—KIPK cDNA was PCR-amplified from clone U22072 (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). For all other genes, cDNAs were generated by PCR amplification using total cDNA derived from whole plant or tissue-specific RNA samples, depending on the level and domain of expression of the AGC gene (Fig. 5). Oligonucleotides containing the specific restriction sites used to clone the cDNAs are available upon request. PCR products were sequenced and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to generate N-terminally tagged glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Polyhistidine (His)-tagged PDK1 (At5g04510) was generated as previously described (25Zegzouti H. Anthony R.G. Jahchan N. Bögre L. Christensen S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6404-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PID-C and WAG1-F mutations were introduced into GST-PID and GST-WAG1 constructs using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PIF domain of PID was introduced into WAG1 and WAG1-F by PCR using a 3′-end primer containing PIF domain nucleotides based on the PINOID PIF sequence. PCR products were sequenced and cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector. GST and His-tagged constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A600 reached 0.7. Cultures were grown for 18 h at 24 °C, and the bacterial pellets were harvested by centrifugation. Bacterial cells expressing GST-tagged proteins were solubilized in 1× PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme and EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Triton X-100 was added to 1% and the soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation for 30 min at 8,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor (Sorvall). The soluble fraction was supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol and 120 μl of glutathioneagarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich), and the mixture was agitated at 4 °C for 2 h. The bead-protein complex was washed four times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. GST Pull-down and Immunoblotting—HIS-PDK1 bacterial lysate was prepared as described above for the GST-tagged protein except that binding buffer BB (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween) was used in place of phosphate-buffered saline. GST or GST-tagged AGC proteins bound to agarose beads were incubated with equal volumes of HIS-PDK1 lysate for 1-2 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The beads were washed four times in BB and two times in BB with 300 mm NaCl and 2% glycerol, and the bound proteins were resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and the bound PDK1 was visualized by Western blotting with an anti-penta-His primary antibody (Qiagen,) and an HRP-conjugated antimouse IgG secondary antibody (Promega). The HRP reaction was developed with ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorylation of AGC Proteins by PDK1—20 μl of HIS-PDK1 bound to GST-AGC beads was washed once with kinase buffer (KB) (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), resuspended in 30 μl of KB containing 50 μm ATP and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA), and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of 4× Laemmli loading buffer, and the samples were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels (Life Therapeutics, Frenchs Forest, Australia). After electrophoresis, the gels were washed for 1 h in SDS running buffer, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad), destained with 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and then dried for visualization by autoradiography. To determine AGC kinase trans-activity, 8 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added to the phosphorylation reaction after 30 min, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Samples containing MBP were separated on 4-20% gradient gel. The band corresponding to MBP was excised from the dried gel, and radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Cloning and Expression of GFP-tagged AGC Kinases—For yeast experiments, the pYES2.0 vector (Invitrogen) was modified by cloning a PCR fragment containing the GFP open reading frame and multicloning site from pEGAD vector (26Cutler S. Ehrhardt D.W. Griffitts J.S. Somerville C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3718-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) into the KpnI and SphI sites to create pYES-GFP. ALSA cDNA was created by introducing mutations into a PID-pGEX4T-1 clone using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. cDNAs encoding PID, AGC1-7, ALSA, and KIPK were cloned into pYES-GFP in-frame with GFP using EcoRI-XhoI, and WAG1 into BamHI-SphI restriction sites. For domain swapping between PID and AGC1-7, the PID sequence between the endogenous BglII and AgeI sites was replaced with a PCR fragment containing the corresponding AGC1-7 sequence resulting in PID-7-PID. 7-PID-7 was created by ligating the PID BglII-AgeI fragment between 5′ EcoRI-BamHI and 3′ AgeI-XhoI AGC1-7 fragments generated by PCR. The resulting chimeras were subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pYES-GFP vector in-frame with GFP. The PID insertion domain (PID-ID), containing amino acids 229-279, was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pYES-GFP vector using EcoRI-XhoI sites. Constructs were used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY2789 (MATα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 lys2-Δ0) grown on YPD medium using the lithium acetate method as described (27Ito H. Fukuda Y. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 103-108Google Scholar). Cells were grown under conditions that select for plasmid retention in minimal media containing either glucose (SDCAA-URA), or galactose (SGCAA-URA) at 30 °C. For microscopy, logarithmic phase yeast cultures were concentrated to 5 × 108 cells/ml by centrifugation at 10000 × g for 30 s and resuspended in fresh medium. For expression in tobacco BY-2 cells, wild-type and chimeric GFP fusion constructs were excised from the corresponding pYES-GFP vector with KpnI and XhoI and ligated into the KpnI and SalI sites of the pPZP212 based binary vector CHF3 behind the CaMV35S promotor. The GFP control plasmid was generated by subcloning the PCR generated KpnI-PstI fragment containing the GFP gene from the pEGAD vector into CHF3. Plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101::pMP90RK by heat shock transformation. Transformed Agrobacteria were grown overnight at 28 °C with shaking in YEP broth (yeast extract, 10 g/liter; peptone, 10 g/liter, NaCl, 5 g/liter; pH 7.0) supplemented with 100 μg/ml spectinomycin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. 3 ml of 3-4-day-old BY-2 tobacco cell suspension cultures were innoculated with 200 μl of Agrobacteria (A600 of 1.5), and the cells were co-incubated with the bacteria in a Petri dish at room temperature in the dark. After 2 days, cells were washed with culture medium 3-4 times, transferred to tubes, and concentrated by centrifugation at 750 × g for 2 min. Concentrated cells were visualized by pipetting 3 μl onto a microscope slide (Fisher) and applying a coverslip (Fisher). Microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope. Images were obtained with a Hamamatsu Orca II camera at ×100 and ×20 objectives for yeast and tobacco cells, respectively. Phospholipid Binding—The binding of PID to biologically active lipids was tested using protein-lipid overlay experiment as described (28Dowler S. Currie R.A. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Membranes with bound phospholipids (PIP-strips, P-6001; Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT) were blocked in a solution of 3% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma; A-7030) in 1× TBS (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) for 2 h at room temperature. Polyhistidine-tagged PID protein was purified as previously described (25Zegzouti H. Anthony R.G. Jahchan N. Bögre L. Christensen S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6404-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and added to the blocking solution. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washes with TBS-T (TBS with 0.1% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated with antipenta-His primary antibody (Qiagen) followed by an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Promega). The HRP reaction was developed with ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham). The experiment was performed three times to verify binding results. Structure of the Arabidopsis AGCVIIIa Kinases—The AGCVIIIa kinase subfamily is comprised of seventeen predicted proteins that are randomly located throughout the Arabidopsis genome (Fig. 1A). The kinases are grouped phylogenetically by both sequence similarity and the presence of several signature domains. In addition to the characteristic DFG to DFD substitution that is shared with the closely related VIIIb group (14Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar), these kinases are uniquely identified by the presence of an insertion domain located between catalytic subdomains VII and VIII (Fig. 1). This domain displays limited sequence similarity between closely related family members, and ranges in size from 48 to 109 amino acids (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Sequence alignment of the AGCVIIIa insertion domains. Sequence alignment of the insertion domains reveals five subclades. Residues in red denote amino acids conserved in more than half of the AGCVIIIa family. Blue, brown, orange, purple, and green-colored amino acids are those common to more than half of the members of individual AGCVIIIa clusters. Stippled bar denotes basic region. The small acidic domain found in AGC1-10 is boxed. Alignments were performed using the Megalign program of Lasergene (DNASTAR).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Other sequences common to the majority of the AGCVIIIa kinases are a pair of motifs characteristic of mammalian PDK1 substrates. The first of these sequences is a hydrophobic, C-terminal domain called the PDK1-interacting fragment, or PIF domain. In animals, phosphorylation of the penultimate serine/threonine residue within the consensus PIF sequence, FXXF(S/T)(Y/F), is believed to be required for PDK1 docking (9Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). 13 of 17 annotated Arabidopsis AGCVIIIa kinases contain a C-terminal sequence, F(E/D)XF (Fig. 1B), similar but not identical to the abbreviated PIF variant found in mammalian PKA (29Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). AtPK7 contains the related sequence IDFF, whereas the remaining three proteins, WAG1, WAG2, and AGC1-12 do not display an obvious C-terminal PIF-like domain (Fig. 1B). In yeast and animals, PDK1 phosphorylates its substrates on the first serine/threonine (P) within a highly conserved activation loop sequence, (S/T)FCGTX(E/D)YXAPE, subsequent to PIF binding (30Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 93-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A nearly identical sequence found in the plant AGCVIIIa kinases, differs from the consensus PDK1 target site only in the substitution of valine for cysteine at the third residue (Fig. 1B). Two kinases, WAG1 and WAG2, also contain a second amino acid substitution in which the phenylalanine at p + 1 is converted to cysteine (Fig. 1B). Unlike the conserved catalytic kinase core, which exhibits an average of 81% amino acid identity among all family members, the small insertion domains found in all AGCVIIIa kinases are variable in sequence. However, amino acid alignments reveal that the insertion domains loosely group into five clusters with higher levels of sequence homology (Fig. 2). With the exception of WAG1 and WAG2, the kinases also share a region enriched in basic residues near the C-terminal portion of the domain (Fig. 2). A single kinase, AGC1-10, contains a small acidic domain upstream of the basic region (Fig. 2). Although homology between individual clusters is limited, the insertion domain sequences within a given cluster are conserved between Arabidopsis AGCVIIIa kinases and orthologous proteins in both monocot and dicotyledonous plant species (data not shown). Retention of the insertion domains by evolutionarily distant species and conservation of cluster specific sequences among higher plants indicates that these regions are likely to be important for kinase function. To assess functional differences or similarities between PID and the 16 homologues predicted by the annotated Arabidopsis genome, we have cloned cDNAs corresponding to 15 of the genes. We were unable to isolate a cDNA for one homologue, AGC1-8. Digital Northern analysis indicates that transcription of this gene is restricted to root tissues (31Zimmermann P. Hirsch-Hoffmann M. Hennig L. Gruissem W. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2621-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar), and our inability to detect the transcript suggests that it may be expressed at low levels or in a restricted number of cells within the root. In Vitro PDK1 Binding and Phosphorylation of AGCVIIIa Kinases—In animal systems, phosphorylation of numerous AGC kinases by the upstream regulator PDK1 induces conformational changes that permit autophosphorylation and activation of substrate kinases (9Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In plants, information regarding the role of PDK1 as a regulator of AGC kinase function is sparse. PINOID has previously been shown to be activated by PDK1 in vitro and in vivo (25Zegzouti H. Anthony R.G. Jahchan N. Bögre L. Christensen S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6404-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Two other Arabidopsis AGC kinases, AGC2-1 and AGC1-1 were identified as PDK1 interactors in a yeast two-hybrid screen (17Anthony R.G. Henriques R. Helfer A. Meszaros T. Rios G. Testerink C. Munnik T. Deak M. Koncz C. Bogre L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 572-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A single tomato kinase, Adi3, an inhibitor of regulated plant cell death, has been shown to be a substrate for the tomato PDK1 kinase (32Devarenne T.P. Ekengren S.K. Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether PDK1 is a candidate upstream regulator of other Arabidopsis AGCVIIIa kinases, we examined the ability of these kinases to serve as substrates for PDK1 in vitro. Pull-down experiments using individual GST-tagged kinases bound to agarose beads and bacterial cell extracts containing His-tagged PDK1 followed by Western blot analysis using anti-His antibody demonstrated that all 15 of the kinases tested interact with PDK1 in vitro (Fig. 3, A and B). PDK1 was not detectable in control assays using GST only. The observation that WAG1, WAG2, and AGC1-12, which lack an obvious PIF domain, bind to PDK1 is consistent with previous experiments in which mutation of the PID PIF domain failed to abolish PDK1 binding and persistent interaction of PDK1 with Adi3 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments following PIF domain mutation (32Devarenne T.P. Ekengren S.K. Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These data confirm that the PIF domain of the AGC kinases is not absolutely required for PDK1 binding in vitro. We next examined changes in phosphorylation levels of the AGCVIIIa proteins subsequent to PDK1"
https://openalex.org/W2005937630,"Replication factor C (RFC) is an AAA+ heteropentamer that couples the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to the loading of the DNA polymerase processivity clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), onto DNA. RFC consists of five subunits in a spiral arrangement (RFC-A, -B, -C, -D, and -E, corresponding to subunits RFC1, RFC4, RFC3, RFC2, and RFC5, respectively). The RFC subunits are AAA+ family proteins and the complex contains four ATP sites (sites A, B, C, and D) located at subunit interfaces. In each ATP site, an arginine residue from one subunit is located near the γ-phosphate of ATP bound in the adjacent subunit. These arginines act as “arginine fingers” that can potentially perform two functions: sensing that ATP is bound and catalyzing ATP hydrolysis. In this study, the arginine fingers in RFC were mutated to examine the steps in the PCNA loading mechanism that occur after RFC binds ATP. This report finds that the ATP sites of RFC function in distinct steps during loading of PCNA onto DNA. ATP binding to RFC powers recruitment and opening of PCNA and activates a γ-phosphate sensor in ATP site C that promotes DNA association. ATP hydrolysis in site D is uniquely stimulated by PCNA, and we propose that this event is coupled to PCNA closure around DNA, which starts an ordered hydrolysis around the ring. PCNA closure severs contact to RFC subunits D and E (RFC2 and RFC5), and the γ-phosphate sensor of ATP site C is switched off, resulting in low affinity of RFC for DNA and ejection of RFC from the site of PCNA loading.

All cellular organisms utilize a multiprotein ATP-driven DNA replicase, which functions with other proteins to duplicate chromosomal DNA prior to cell division (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA replication. 2nd Ed. W.H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). DNA replicases are composed of a DNA polymerase, a ring-shaped processivity clamp, and a clamp loader ATPase (reviewed in Ref. 2Johnson A. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 283-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The DNA polymerase binds to the processivity clamp protein, which completely encircles DNA. The clamp slides on DNA and is pulled along by the polymerase during chain extension, continuously holding polymerase to DNA and constraining it to act in a highly processive manner. The eukaryotic ring-shaped processivity factor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), 2The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RFC, replication factor C; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SRC, Ser-Arg-Cys; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. is a trimer of three identical subunits arranged head-to-tail to generate a ring with a large central cavity for encircling DNA (3Krishna T.S.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 9Maga G. Hubscher U. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). An interface between two PCNA monomers must be disrupted and opened to place DNA into the center of the ring. The ring must then be re-closed for the clamp to remain bound to the DNA and function with the polymerase. The eukaryotic clamp loader complex, replication factor C (RFC), uses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to recruit the processivity clamp to DNA, break one clamp interface, and topologically link the clamp to primed template DNA (10Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3883-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Studies in the Escherichia coli system have shown that the clamp loader and DNA polymerase compete for the clamp, and therefore the clamp loader must eject from the clamp for the DNA polymerase to use it (16Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Likewise, RFC and Pol δ also compete for binding to PCNA (17Mossi R. Jonsson Z.O.

Yoshikawa H. Tsurimoto T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, after PCNA is linked to DNA, RFC ejects from the clamp to allow the polymerase access to the clamp (19Podust V.N. Tiwari N. Stephan S. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31992-31999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (summarized in Fig. 1A). A crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC-ATPγS-PCNA reveals RFC to consist of a circular collar from which the five ATP-binding modules are suspended (Fig. 1B) (20Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This subunit arrangement is similar to the E. coli γ complex clamp loader (21Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), which loads the ring-shaped β clamp onto DNA (22Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current study refers to the five RFC subunits based on their sequential order in the pentamer: RFC-A for RFC1, RFC-B for RFC4, RFC-C for RFC3, RFC-D for RFC2, and RFC-E for RFC5 (see Fig. 1C). This alphabetical nomenclature facilitates the comparison of subunits in analogous positions in RFC and γ complex. The structural similarity between prokaryotic and eukaryotic clamps and clamp loaders suggests that the clamp loading mechanisms may be similar, in general terms, and biochemical studies in both systems support this suggestion (23O'Donnell M.

The clamp loader-ATP-open clamp complex then associates with primed template DNA. The association of clamp loader-ATP-clamp complex with DNA does not appear to require ATP hydrolysis, and it is thought that DNA is positioned inside the central channel of the clamp during this step (20Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 31Bowman G.D. Goedken E.R. Kazmirski S.L. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Goedken E.R. Kazmirski S.L. Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J.

DNA binding triggers ATP hydrolysis in the clamp loader, which then closes the clamp and ejects from DNA, leaving the closed ring on DNA. This final stage of the clamp loading mechanism requires hydrolysis of ATP and is currently viewed as a single step, although multiple ATP molecules are hydrolyzed, and thus this stage of the reaction is likely composed of multiple steps. The five RFC subunits each contain three domains (domains I-III), and the primary sequence of these domains is homologous among the five subunits; only the RFC-A (RFC1) subunit has additional N- and C-terminal regions (34Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 35Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Cai J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10065-10071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The RFC pentamer complex is mainly held together by a tightly packed “collar” region consisting of domain III of each RFC subunit (see Fig. 1, A and B). The N-terminal ATPase modules, composed of domains I and II, are arranged in a right-handed spiral with an overall pitch that closely matches double-stranded DNA (20Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A cavity exists in the center of this protein spiral that is sufficiently large to accommodate double-stranded DNA. Furthermore, conserved polar and positively charged residues line this cavity and are proposed to interact with DNA (20Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 31Bowman G.D. Goedken E.R. Kazmirski S.L. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). There is a gap between two subunits, RFC-A and RFC-E (illustrated in Fig. 1, A and C), which is presumed to provide an exit path for single-stranded DNA from the central cavity (20Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved residues that line the central cavity in γ complex causes a decrease in DNA binding, which supports the hypothesis that DNA binds in the central cavity of these clamp loaders (32Goedken E.R. Kazmirski S.L. Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2005; 12: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A similar study in RFC shows that residues within the central cavity are required for DNA binding (36Yao N.Y. Johnson A. Bowman G. Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17528-17539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A recent electron microscopic reconstruction of Pyrococcus furiosus RFC reveals that PCNA adopts a spiral conformation when held open in a complex of RFC-ATPγS-PCNA-DNA (37Miyata T. Suzuki H. Oyama T. Mayanagi K. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13795-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, molecular dynamics simulations of yeast PCNA indicate that PCNA alone may readily adopt a right-handed spiral when open (38Kazmirski S.L. Zhao Y. Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13801-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The spiral conformation of open PCNA may allow a more intimate contact between the clamp and the five-subunit spiral of RFC. The ATPase modules of the five RFC subunits are similar in structure to the AAA+ family of ATPases (39Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome. Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This family includes a wide variety of factors that couple ATP binding and hydrolysis to remodel protein substrates (40Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). A common feature of oligomeric AAA+ complexes is the location of ATP sites at the interface of two subunits. Interactions between AAA+ modules of RFC subunits create four interfacial ATP sites that are competent for hydrolysis (20Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 41Yao N. Coryell L. Zhang D. Georgescu R.E. Finkelstein J. Coman M.M. Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50744-50753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The four ATP sites of RFC have previously been referred to numerically, with ATP site 1 at the RFC-D/E interface. In this study we adopt an alphabetical nomenclature for the ATP sites to correspond with the RFC subunit nomenclature. Thus, the four ATPase sites are referred to as ATP sites A-D (Fig. 1C), with site A at the RFC-A/B interface and site D at the RFC-D/E interface. RFC-E (RFC5) also binds nucleotide (20Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), but the nucleotide-binding pocket of RFC-E is not competent for hydrolysis nor is it needed for RFC activity (25Cai J. Yao N. Gibbs E. Finkelstein J. Phillips B. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11607-11612Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Each of the four interfacial ATP sites in RFC consist of one subunit that binds the ATP, plus side chains from the adjacent subunit (Fig. 1C). One of the most prominent residues emanating from the adjacent subunit is a highly conserved arginine that is part of a Ser-Arg-Cys (SRC) motif found in RFC Box VII (34Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), a region of sequence similarity found in all clamp loaders. This arginine side chain is referred to as an “arginine finger” by analogy to an arginine residue inserted at the active site of the Ras protein by the GTPase-activating proteins (42Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The RFC-B arginine finger functions in ATP site A, and the arginine finger of RFC-C functions in ATP site B and so on (see Fig. 1C). In the E. coli γ complex clamp loader these arginine fingers have been shown to have two functions: they sense bound ATP and also play a catalytic role in ATP hydrolysis (43Johnson A. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14406-14413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 44Snyder A.K. Williams C.R. Johnson A. O'Donnell M. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4386-4393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sensor functions of the arginine fingers in the γ complex clamp loader are thought to be coupled to conformational changes that promote binding to the clamp and DNA (44Snyder A.K. Williams C.R. Johnson A. O'Donnell M. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4386-4393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The arginine fingers are needed for ATP hydrolysis (43Johnson A. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14406-14413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and are presumed to act by stabilizing the growing negative charge as the γ-phosphate is cleaved from ATP (21Jeruzalmi D.

In both RFC and γ complex, ATPγS binding promotes ring opening and DNA binding, but the clamp does not re-close (12Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol.

Previous studies of prokaryotic and eukaryotic clamp loaders suggest that individual ATP sites play specific roles in clamp loading (29Schmidt S.L. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34784-34791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 44Snyder A.K. Williams C.R. Johnson A. O'Donnell M. Bloom L.B. J. Biol.

Mutational analysis in yeast RFC has shown that ATP binding to sites C and D of RFC is essential for DNA binding (29Schmidt S.L. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34784-34791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but it is not clear how ATP binding is coupled to DNA binding. In E. coli γ complex, the arginine finger in ATP site D functions allosterically in promoting β clamp association, and the arginine fingers in sites B and/or C are involved in promoting DNA binding (44Snyder A.K.

These findings support the suggestion that there is a division of activities among ATP sites in clamp loaders. Perhaps specific ATP sites control other important clamp loader actions such as clamp closing and clamp loader ejection from the clamp and DNA. This report examines different RFC complexes that have one or more arginine finger residues mutated to alanine. We show that none of the arginine fingers of RFC are needed for the steps of PCNA interaction and ring opening. However, our results demonstrate that certain ATP sites of RFC play distinct roles downstream of PCNA opening. The arginine finger in ATP site C is needed for RFC to bind DNA. ATP hydrolysis in site D is specifically triggered by PCNA, and we propose that hydrolysis in this site leads to closure of PCNA around DNA. The crystal structure of RFC-PCNA shows that closed PCNA no longer interacts with RFC-D and RFC-E, and thus ring closure is presumed to lead to loss of RFC affinity for PCNA and dissociation of RFC from the PCNA-DNA complex. Materials—Unlabeled ADP and ATP were purchased from Sigma, unlabeled ATPγS and eosin-5-maleimide were from Roche Diagnostics, and radioactive nucleoside triphosphates were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc. The following proteins were purified as described: PCNA and PCNA (Cys81-Only) (50Ayyagari R. Impellizzeri K.J. Yoder B.L. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and E. coli SSB (51Yao N. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1421-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PCNA and RFC concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride using extinction coefficients calculated from the Trp and Tyr content (PCNA, ϵ280 = 5120 m-1 cm-1; RFC, ϵ280 = 158,880 m-1 cm-1). All other protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay reagent (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. PCNAHK is a PCNA construct with a His-tag and a N-terminal 6-residue kinase recognition site (52Kelman Z. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Gene. 1995; 166: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PCNAHK was purified in one step by nickel chelate chromatography. PCNAHK was labeled to a specific activity of 100 dpm/fmol with [γ-32P]ATP using the recombinant catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase produced in E. coli (a gift from Dr. Susan Taylor, University of California at San Diego). The following oligonucleotides were synthesized and gel-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies: 30-mer, 5′-GCA ATA ACT GGC CGT CGT TTG AAG ATT TCG-3′; 66-mer, 5′-CCA TTC TGT AAC GCC AGG GTT TTC GCA GTC AAC ATT CGA AAT CTT CAA ACG ACG GCC AGT TAT TGC-3′. A 102-mer 3′-biotinylated oligonucleotide was synthesized and gel-purified by the W. M. Keck Facility at Yale University: 5′-CCA TTC TGT AAC GCC AGG GTT TTC GCA GTC AAC ATT CGA AAT CTT CAA ACG ACG GCC AGT TAT TGC TCT TCT TGA GTT TGA TAG CCA AAA CGA CCA TTA TAG-3′ (Biotin). To form synthetic primed template, the 30-mer primer oligonucleotide was mixed with either the 66-mer or 102-mer template strand in a 1:1.2 ratio of primer to template in 50 μl of 5 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate (final pH 8.5), then incubated in a 95 °C water bath, which was allowed to cool to room temperature over a 30-min interval. For reactions using primed M13mp18 ssDNA, the M13mp18 ssDNA was purified (53Turner J. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and primed with a 30-mer DNA oligonucleotide as described (54Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Nitrocellulose membrane circles were purchased from Schleicher and Schuell, and polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates were purchased from EM Science. Streptavidin-coated Dynabead M-280 magnetic beads were purchased from Dynal Biotech. Buffers—Buffer A is 30 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol (v/v). Buffer B is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol (v/v). Membrane Wash Buffer is: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl. Reaction buffer is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 4% glycerol (v/v), and 40 μg/ml BSA. Gel filtration buffer is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 4% glycerol (v/v). Clamp loading buffer is 30 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 7 mm MgCl2, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm CHAPS. ATPase buffer is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol (v/v). Construction and Purification of RFC(SAC) Mutants—Individual RFC-B (RFC4), RFC-C (RFC3), RFC-D (RFC2), and RFC-E (RFC5) genes were mutated using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The following mutations were made: RFC-B (RFC4) Arg157 to Ala, RFC-C (RFC3) Arg160 to Ala, RFC-D (RFC2) Arg183 to Ala, RFC-E (RFC5) Arg184 to Ala. All S. cerevisiae five-subunit RFC complexes used in this study were expressed in E. coli using a two-plasmid system described previously (55Finkelstein J. Antony E. Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In all RFC constructs, the first 283 residues of the RFC-A (RFC1) subunit were deleted and RFC-A contained an N-terminal His-kinase tag (52Kelman Z. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Gene. 1995; 166: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All RFC complexes were purified as follows. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and grown in 12 liters of Luria broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C. Upon reaching an OD of 0.6, cells were brought to 15 °C, and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.5 mm, followed by a 12-h incubation with shaking at 15 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 ml of Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl, and lysed using a French press at 22,000 p.s.i. 2 mm PMSF was added to the cell lysate, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to a 100 ml of SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. Protein was eluted in a 750-ml gradient from 150-600 mm NaCl. The five-subunit RFC complex eluted at ∼510 mm NaCl, separating from RFC subcomplexes that eluted in earlier fractions. Fractions from the SP-Sepharose column containing five-subunit RFC were pooled, diluted in Buffer B to a conductivity equal to 100 mm NaCl, and loaded onto a 15-ml Fast Flow Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer B containing 90 mm NaCl. Protein was eluted using an 80-ml gradient of Buffer B from 90-500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing RFC eluted at ∼250 mm NaCl and were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. The protein yield was ∼50 mg from 12 liters of E. coli culture. ATPγS Binding Assays—Nitrocellulose membrane circles (25 mm) were washed with 0.5 m NaOH, rinsed immediately with water, and equilibrated in membrane wash buffer before use. Reactions contained 1 μm RFC and [35S]ATPγS (0-25 μm) in Buffer B + 160 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 15 μl. After 1-min incubation on ice, 10 μl of the reaction was filtered through a pretreated nitrocellulose membrane on a glass microanalysis filter assembly (Fisher) at a rate of 60 μl/min. The membrane was immediately washed with 150 μl of ice-cold membrane wash buffer at ∼1 ml/min. Membrane circles were dried, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. An apparent Kd was determined using the simple binding model, RFC + ATPγS ↔ RFC-ATPγS, to fit the data using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Clamp Loading Assays Using Primed M13mp18 ssDNA—Clamp loading was measured using 32P-PCNAHK (29.4 nm as trimer), which was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with RFC BCDE(SAC) or wild-type RFC (16.7 nm), in 60 μl of Reaction Buffer containing primed M13mp18 ssDNA (17 nm), SSB (4.2 μm as tetramer), 0.5 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was applied to a 5-ml Bio-Gel A-15m column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer containing 100 mm NaCl at 23 °C. Thirty-five fractions of 180 μl each were collected, and 100 μl was analyzed by liquid scintillation. 32P-PCNAHK-DNA complex elutes in the early fractions (fractions 9-15), while the free 32P-PCNAHK elutes later (fractions 18-31). The amount of PCNA in each fraction was determined from its known specific activity.

Distinct from P1B-type ATPases, plant Zn2+-ATPases have long C-terminal sequences rich in Cys and His. Removal of the 244 amino acid C terminus of HMA2 leads to a 43% reduction in enzyme turnover without significant effect on the Zn2+ K½ for enzyme activation. Characterization of the isolated HMA2 C terminus showed that this fragment binds three Zn2+ with high affinity (Kd = 16 ± 3nm). Circular dichroism spectral analysis indicated the presence of 8% α-helix, 45% β-sheet, and 48% random coil in the C-terminal peptide with noticeable structural changes upon metal binding (8% α-helix, 39% β-sheet, and 52% random coil). Zn K-edge XAS of Zn-C-MBD in the presence of one equivalent of Zn2+ shows that the average zinc complex formed is composed of three His and one Cys residues. Upon the addition of two extra Zn2+ ions per C-MBD, these appear coordinated primarily by His residues thus, suggesting that the three Zn2+ binding domains might not be identical. Modification of His residues with diethyl pyrocarbonate completely inhibited Zn2+ binding to the C terminus, pointing out the importance of His residues in Zn2+ coordination. In contrast, alkylation of Cys with iodoacetic acid did not prevent Zn2+ binding to the HMA2 C terminus. Zn K-edge XAS of the Cys-alkylated protein was consistent with (N/O)4 coordination of the zinc site, with three of those ligands fitting for His residues. In summary, plant Zn2+-ATPases contain novel metal binding domains in their cytoplasmic C terminus. Structurally distinct from the well characterized N-terminal metal binding domains present in most P1B-type ATPases, they also appear to regulate enzyme turnover rate.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This Zn2+-ATPase drives the efflux of metals out of the cell and is activated by Zn2+ and Cd2+ with quite low apparent affinities (0.1–0.2 μm).

In our laboratory, we have observed that N-MBDs of Archaeoglobus fulgidus CopA, a Cu+-ATPase, and CopB, a Cu2+-ATPase with a His-rich N-MBD, control the turnover rate of these enzymes but do not affect metal binding to the transport site (32Mana-Capelli S.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11040-11047Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Specifically, the rate-limiting conformational change associated with metal release/dephosphorylation is affected by metal binding to N-MBDs (32Mana-Capelli S. Mandal A.K. Argüello J.M. J. Biol.

In addition, studies of the human Cu+-ATPases, Menkes and Wilson disease proteins that contain six N-MBDs, suggest that these (or a subset of them) are required for copper-induced relocalization of these ATPases from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane and a vesicular compartment, respectively (5Petris M.J.

Similar to Cu+-ATPases N-MBDs, ZntA N-MBD is not essential for enzyme activity but truncation of this domain results in a decrease in overall rate of the enzyme without altering metal affinity (29Mitra B. Sharma R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7694-7699Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 39Liu J. Dutta S.J. Stemmler A.J. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all eukaryote (plant) Zn2+-ATPases lack the typical N-MBDs. In these, the CXXC conserved sequence is replaced by CCXSE (X = S/T/P) (except Oryza sativa HMA3, which has CCXAE). In addition, all plant Zn2+-ATPases appear to have unusually long C termini ranging from 61 amino acids in Arabidopsis halleri HMA3 to 479 amino acids in Thalaspi caerulescens HMA4. These contain numerous Cys-Cys repeat sequences and His residues. These Cys- and His-rich segments are uncommon among non-plant P1B-type ATPases. Considering the metal ligating capability of sulfhydryl and imidazole side chains, then it is tempting to hypothesize that these might constitute C-terminal metal binding domains (C-MBDs). However, studies based on functional complementation approaches have provided conflicting results on the roles of Zn2+-ATPases putative C-MBDs. Truncation of the C terminus His-rich stretch (the last 16 amino acids of the C terminus) of A. thaliana HMA4 impaired the enzyme ability to complement ycf1 (Cd2+-sensitive) and zrc1 (Zn2+-sensitive) yeasts in the presence of high Cd2+ or Zn2+ (40Verret F. Gravot A. Auroy P. Preveral S. Frostier C. Vavasseur A. Richaud P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In a different study, truncation of its whole C terminus did not affect the capacity of A. thaliana HMA4 to confer Cd2+ resistance to the ycf1 yeast (41Mills R.F. Francini A. Ferreira da Rocha P.S.C. Baccarani P.J. Aylett M. Krijger G.C. Williams L.E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional role of the long cytoplasmic C terminus of plant Zn2+-ATPases has not been established. Here, we describe the functional role of A. thaliana HMA2 C-MBD. The ATPase kinetics and metal dependence of trun-cated HMA2, lacking the cytoplasmic C terminus fragment, was characterized. In addition, the isolated cytoplasmic C terminus fragment was heterologously expressed, and its metal binding properties were determined. Our data show that the HMA2 C terminus contains a novel domain with multiple metal binding sites. Moreover, they indicate that metal binding to this C-MBD probably regulates the enzyme turnover rate. Cloning and Expression of HMA2 Constructs—A. thaliana HMA2 and truncated forms of the protein were expressed containing a C-terminal Strep tag (WSHPQFEK). HMA2 cDNA was amplified from a previously prepared HMA2-pBAD/TOPO vector (10Eren E. Argüello J.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) by using the oligonucleotides: 5′-AGAGGTACCAATAATGGCGTCGAAGA and 3′-AAGCTCGAGTTCAATCACAATC. Resulting cDNA was ligated into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pPRIBA1 vector (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). This vector introduces a Strep tag at the C-terminal end of the protein. HMA2-Strep tag cDNA was amplified using the oligonucleotides: 5′-AGAGGTACCAATAATGGCGTCGAAGA and 3′-GCGTTTAAACTTATTTTTCGAACTGC and the HMA2-pPRIBA1 as a template. The amplicon was ligated into the KpnI and PmeI sites of the yeast expression vector pYES2/CT (Invitrogen). Constructs to express truncated HMA2 proteins were prepared: ΔC-HMA2 cDNA encoding HMA2 lacking the 244 C-terminal amino acids, starting in Met1 and ending in Glu707, and ΔNC-HMA2 encoding HMA2 lacking the N-terminal first 75 amino acids and C-terminal 244 amino acids, starting from Val76 and ending in Glu707. ΔC-HMA2 and ΔN,C-HMA2 constructs were amplified from HMA2-pBAD/TOPO construct using the oligonucleotides: ΔC-HMA2 5′-AGAGGTACCAATAATGGCGTCGAAGA and 3′-GCCTCGAGCTCCCTATAACATTTGTTT; ΔNC-HMA2 5′-GCGGTACCAAAAATGGTAACCGGAGAACCAA and 3′-GCCTCGAGCTCCCTATAACATTTGTTT. Resulting cDNAs were cloned into KpnI and XhoI sites of the HMA2-pYES2/Strep construct. Consequently, the truncated HMA2 proteins also contained a C-terminal Strep tag. Yeast strain INVSc1 MATα his3Δ1 leu2 trp1–289 ura3–52 (Invitrogen) was transformed by electroporation of cells at 1.5 kV, 25 μF, 200Ω. Expression of HMA2 constructs in yeast was performed as previously described (10Eren E. Argüello J.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Yeast Membrane Preparation—Membranes from yeast were prepared as previously described (10Eren E. Argüello J.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 30Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured in accordance to Bradford (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out in 10% acrylamide gels (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Heterologous proteins in the membrane preparations were detected by electroblotting the gels onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunostaining with Strep-Tactin horseradish peroxidase antibody (IBA). To compare HMA2, ΔC-HMA2, and ΔN,C-HMA2 relative expression levels, equal amounts of each membrane preparation were subjected to a 1:2 serial dilutions. These were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, immunostained as indicated, and integrated density values were quantified using AlphaImager software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Laendro, CA). ATPase Assay—Metal-dependent ATPase activity determinations were performed as previously described (10Eren E. Argüello J.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) in a media containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 20 mm cysteine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg ml–1 saponin, and 40 μg ml–1 protein (membrane preparation), at 30 °C. The concentrations of ZnCl2 or CdCl2 were varied as indicated in the figures. ATPase activity measured in the absence of metal was always <12.5% of Vmax for all protein preparations (HMA2, ΔC-HMA2, and ΔN,C-HMA2). Background was subtracted from plotted values. Membrane preparation from empty vector-transformed cells have no Zn-dependent ATPase activity (10Eren E. Argüello J.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Curves of ATPase activity versus metal concentration were fit to v = VmaxL/(L + K½), where L is the concentration of the variable ligand. The reported standard errors for Vmax and K½ are asymptotic standard errors reported by the fitting software (Kaleidagraph, Synergy, Reading, PA). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of HMA2 C-MBD—A cDNA coding for the last 244 amino acids of HMA2, from Ser708 to Glu951 (C-MBD) was amplified by using the oligonucleotides: 5′-GCCGGTACCTCTTCTTCTTCCTCGG and 3′-AAGCTCGAGTTCAATCACAATC and HMA2-pBAD/TOPO as a template. Resulting amplicon was cloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of the bacterial expression vector pPRIBA1 (C-MBD-pPRIBA1). This introduces a Strep tag into the C-terminal end of the protein. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with this vector. C-MBD expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.00, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm TCEP. Cells were disrupted by sonication on ice (3 × 30 s) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was passed through Strep-Tactin Superflow column (IBA). The column was washed with five volumes of homogenization buffer, and the C-MBD was eluted with 100 mm Tris, pH 8.00, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, and 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. The protein was concentrated to 3 mg ml–1 using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centricon (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and stored in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.00, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm TCEP at –80 °C. Routine protein concentration determinations were performed in accordance to Bradford (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). The accuracy of colorimetric protein measurements was confirmed by total amino acid hydrolysis (Keck Facility, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Before metal binding stoichiometry determinations the storage buffer was exchanged with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl using a Sephadex G-10 column (Sigma). Similarly, for Zn2+ binding titrations, the storage buffer was exchanged with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP. Metal Binding Stoichiometry Determinations—Metal contents were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) (AAnalyst 300, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All the buffers used in these determinations were passed through a Chelex-100 column (Sigma). 30 μm C-MBD was incubated with 0.5–1.0 mm metal (Zn2+, Cd2+, and Co2+) in the presence and absence of 1 mm TCEP at 4 °C for 30 min. Excess metal was removed either by passage through a Sephadex G-10 column (Sigma) or by an Amicon Ultra-15 Centricon (Millipore), both methods yielded identical results. Blank samples lacking either the protein or the metals were prepared in a similar manner. Samples were acid digested at 80 °C for 1 h and then overnight at room temperature with concentrated HNO3. After digestion, H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 1.5%. Background metal levels in blank samples were <15% of the level detected in C-MBD samples. Spectroscopic Analysis of Metal Binding to C-MBD—Zn2+ binding experiments using the Zn2+ binding chromophore mag-fura-2 were carried out as previously described (38Liu J. Stemmler A.J. Fatima J. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5159-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 44VanZile M.L. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11818-11829Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 10 μm C-MBD was titrated with 1 mm Zn2+ in the presence of 20 μm mag-fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and the absorbance change at 366 nm was monitored. Free metal concentrations were calculated from KI = [I·Zn2+]/[Ifree][Zn2+], where I is mag-fura-2 and KI is the association constant of magfura-2 for Zn2+ (38Liu J. Stemmler A.J. Fatima J. Mitra B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5159-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An extinction coefficient of 29,900 m–1 cm–1 at 366 nm for metal-free mag-fura-2 and KI of 5.0 × 107 m–1 was used in determinations of free mag-fura-2 and free Zn2+ (45Walkup G.K. Imperiali B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3443-3450Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The metal-protein association constant (Ka) and the number of metal binding sites (n) in C-MBD, were calculated by fitting the data to ν = nKa[Metal]f/(1 + Ka[Metal]f), where ν is the ratio of moles of metal bound to total protein (46Guo J. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 730-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As above, reported errors for Ka and n are asymptotic standard errors provided by the fitting software (Origin, OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Free Thiol Quantification—A DTNB colorimetric assay was used to determine the number of reduced thiols in C-MBD (47Bulaj G. Kortemme T. Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8965-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). A standard calibration curve was prepared using l-cysteine (Sigma). C-MBD (0.25 mg/ml) was added to a media containing 100 μm Tris, pH 8.00, 2.5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm ascorbic acid, 100 μm DTNB. The reaction was allowed to go to completion for 30 min at 25 °C. The molar concentration of thiolate anion was quantified at 412 nm (ϵ = 13600 m–1 cm–1). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—C-MBD was passed through a Sephadex-G10 column (Sigma) equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mm TCEP, and adjusted to 5 μm C-MBD in the presence and absence of 75 μm metal (Zn2+, Co2+, Cu+). Circular dichroism data were recorded on an Aviv 60DS spectrometer with a 25-nm bandwidth, and were collected every 1 nm at 20 °C. Background spectra recorded with buffer alone or buffer with metal were subtracted from the sample spectra. The data were analyzed in the Dichroweb site using the K2d analysis algorithm (48Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 49Whitmore L.

Morán F Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Carboxymethylation of Cysteines—C-MBD (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl buffer for 30 min at 25 °C to reduce disulfide bonds. The reduced protein was incubated with 20 mm iodoacetic acid (IAA) for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark. The protein was washed in an Amicon Ultra-15 Centricon (Millipore) with 15 volumes 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP. Modification of Histidines with Diethyl Pyrocarbonate (DEPC)—C-MBD (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 15 mm DEPC, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl buffer for 30 min at 25 °C. The modified protein was washed in an Amicon Ultra-15 Centricon (Millipore) with 15 volumes 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm TCEP. The number of DEPC-modified His was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ = 3200 m–1 cm–1) as previously described (51Goto J.J. Zhu H. Sanchez R.J. Nersissian A. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation for X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) Analysis—1 ml of 0.88 mm C-MBD was incubated with 0.88 mm Zn2+ or with 2.64 mm Zn2+ in the presence of 1 mm TCEP for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein was washed in an Amicon Ultra-15 Centricon (Millipore) with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The stoichiometry of Zn:C-MBD was determined by AAS as described above. XAS Data Collection and Analysis—Zn K-edge XAS data for C-MBD were collected on beam line X9B at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The sample was placed in a polycarbonate sample holder and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected under ring conditions of 2.8 GeV and 120–300 mA using a sagitally focusing Si (111) double crystal monochromator. The x-ray energy of the focused monochromatic beam was internally calibrated to the first inflection of a Zn2+ foil spectrum (9660.7 eV). X-ray fluorescence data were collected using a 13-element Ge detector (Canberra). X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) data were collected from ∼9460–9860 eV and x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were collected from 9460–10640 eV. The primary vertical aperture was set to 0.3 mm for all samples. EXAFS data were analyzed using the program EXAFS123 (52Padden K.M.K.J.F. Trafford K.T. Yap G.P.A. Rheingold A.H. Borovik A.S.

https://openalex.org/W2047624429,"The cytoplasmic membrane protein TatB is an essential component of the Escherichia coli twin-arginine (Tat) protein translocation pathway. Together with the TatC component it forms a complex that functions as a membrane receptor for substrate proteins. Structural predictions suggest that TatB is anchored to the membrane via an N-terminal transmembrane α-helix that precedes an amphipathic α-helical section of the protein. From truncation analysis it is known that both these regions of the protein are essential for function. Here we construct 31 unique cysteine substitutions in the first 42 residues of TatB. Each of the substitutions results in a TatB protein that is competent to support Tat-dependent protein translocation. Oxidant-induced disulfide cross-linking shows that both the N-terminal and amphipathic helices form contacts with at least one other TatB protomer. For the transmembrane helix these contacts are localized to one face of the helix. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations provide insight into the possible structural basis of the transmembrane helix interactions. Using variants with double cysteine substitutions in the transmembrane helix, we were able to detect cross-links between up to five TatB molecules. Protein purification showed that species containing at least four cross-linked TatB molecules are found in correctly assembled TatBC complexes. Our results suggest that the transmembrane helices of TatB protomers are in the center rather than the periphery of the TatBC complex.

Our results suggest that the transmembrane helices of TatB protomers are in the center rather than the periphery of the TatBC complex. Protein transport across the cytoplasmic membrane of most bacteria proceeds by one of two pathways. The major route of protein translocation is the Sec pathway, to which substrates are targeted by N-terminal signal peptides. Protein transport by the Sec machinery proceeds via an N- to C-terminal threading mechanism (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2034-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The Tat pathway operates in parallel to the Sec system but, by contrast, exports folded proteins (3Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2003; 47: 187-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Substrates that target to the Tat machinery are also synthesized with N-terminal signal peptides, which in this case harbor a consensus SRRXFLK motif (4Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The Tat system, which is energized solely by the transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient, is structurally and mechanistically related to the ΔpH-dependent thylakoid import pathway of chloroplasts (5Mori H. Cline K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).In Escherichia coli, four proteins, TatA, TatB, TatC, and TatE, have been identified that are required for Tat-dependent protein translocation (6Sargent F.

Biol. 2004; 341: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). TatA, TatB, and TatE are sequence-related proteins that are predicted to share a common structure comprising an N-terminal transmembrane α-helix, followed by an adjacent amphipathic helix and a C-terminal region of variable length (6Sargent F. Bogsch E. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 12Chanal A. Santini C.-L. Wu L.-F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). TatA and TatE share an essential function in the export process (6Sargent F. Bogsch E. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). It is likely that tatE is a cryptic gene duplication of tatA, because expression studies indicate that tatA is expressed at much higher levels than tatE (13Jack R.L. Sargent F. Berks B.C. Sawers G. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). TatB shares some sequence homology with TatA/E (∼25% identity at the amino acid level) but is considerably longer. TatB is an essential component of the E. coli Tat machinery (8Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). TatA and TatB are integral inner membrane proteins. However, upon removal of the N-terminal transmembrane domain, TatA becomes a soluble protein, whereas TatB retains peripheral interactions with the membrane (14de Leeuw E. Porcelli I. Sargent F. Palmer T. Berks B.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Truncation and point mutational analysis have indicated that only the first 40 or so residues of TatA and the first 101 residues of TatB, comprising the N-terminal membrane-bound and the adjacent amphipathic helices of each protein, are necessary to support Tat function (15Lee P.A. Buchanan G. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5871-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Hicks M.G. Lee P.A. Georgiou G. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2920-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Both TatA and TatB are found in the cell membrane as high molecular mass complexes. However, the organization and function of the complexes formed by each of these homologous proteins are very different.TatA forms homo-oligomeric complexes that contain varying numbers of TatA protomers (14de Leeuw E.

This TatBC complex runs as a single ∼400-kDa species on blue native PAGE when solubilized with digitonin from membranes containing either native or overexpressed levels of Tat proteins (17Oates J.

Given the size of the complex it is clear that it must contain multiple copies of both TatB and TatC. An analogous complex is found in the thylakoid Tat system (21Cline K. Mori H. J.

The TatBC complex binds substrate proteins through their twin-arginine signal peptides and thus acts as the substrate receptor complex of the Tat pathway (21Cline K. Mori H. J.

McDevitt, G. Buchanan, F. Sargent, T. Palmer, and B. C. Berks, submitted for publication.To date the only information on the organization of TatB within the TatBC complex has come from chemical cross-linking studies. Experiments using two types of amine-specific reagents detected homodimeric TatB species (14de Leeuw E. Porcelli I. Sargent F. Palmer T. Berks B.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that each TatB protein is in intimate contact with another TatB molecule.In this study we have used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis to search for residues that are important for TatB function and have then used these cysteine variants to map TatB-TatB interactions. Cross-linking of TatB variants with double cysteine substitutions indicates that the protein forms a higher order multimer within the TatBC complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Plasmids—Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) 6The abbreviations used are: TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide; IPTG, isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; CuP, Cu(II)phenanthroline; POPE, palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. reductase activity and cysteine cross-linking assays were performed in strain DADE-P (As MC4100 (26Casadaban M.J.

This was constructed by P1 transduction of the Tn10d-linked pcnB1 allele (8Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol.

Strain GB100 (As MC4100, pcnB1 zad-981::Tn10d (Kmr), dsbA::Cm, ΔtatABC::aac (3)IV) was constructed from strain MC4100-P (28Buchanan G. de Leeuw E. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) as follows. Initially the dsbA::Cm allele from strain LM105 (29Masip L. Pan J.L. Haldar S. Penner-Hahn J.E. DeLisa M.P. Georgiou G. Bardwell J.C. Collet J.F. Science. 2004; 303: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was introduced by P1 transduction. Subsequently, a marked deletion of tatABC was also introduced by P1 transduction. The deletion of tatABC marked with an apramycin resistance cassette was constructed following amplification of the apramycin resistance gene in plasmid pIJ773 (30Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar) using the following primers: 5′-TTTAATCATCATCTACCACAGAGGAACATGATGGGTGGTCATGAGCTCAGCCAATCGA-3′ and 5′-GGGCGGTTGAATTTATTCTTCAGTTTTTTCGCTTTCTGCGGGTTAGTGCAGCTCCATC3′. The marked deletion was initially introduced onto the chromosome of strain BW25113 using the method of Datsenko and Wanner (31Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10974) Google Scholar).Plasmid pUNITAT1 carries tatA, tatB, and tatC in pQE60 (Qiagen). This construct contains the native stop codon of tatC, and therefore the native, nontagged TatC protein is produced. The tatA, tatB, and tatC genes were amplified by PCR using primers TATA5 (6Sargent F. Bogsch E. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), TATCBAM (5′-GCGCGGATCCTTATTCTTCAGTTTTTTCGCTTTCT-3′), and MC4100 chromosomal DNA as template. The product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the polylinker region of pQE60 to give plasmid pQEABC. The QuikChange™ system was then used to introduce a 2-bp substitution in the intergenic region between tatA and tatB, such that a PmlI restriction site was introduced. A second round of QuikChange™ was then used to introduce an AflII restriction site between tatB and tatC to give plasmid pUNITAT1. This was achieved by substituting the penultimate codon of tatB from CCG (Pro) to CCT (Pro) and by changing the first base of the 2-bp tatB/C intergenic region from A to G. This allows easy replacement of wild type tatA, tatB, or tatC genes. A derivative of tatC in which all four cysteine codons had been substituted for alanines was subsequently introduced into pUNITAT1 as follows. A PCR product covering the tatC gene was generated using primers TATCAFL (5′-GCGCGAATTCCTTAAGCATGTCTGTAGAAGATACT-3′) and TATCBAM, with a cysteine-less derivative of tatC in pBluescript as template (28Buchanan G. de Leeuw E. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The product was digested with AflII and BamHI and cloned into pUNITAT1 digested with the same enzymes to give plasmid pUNITATCC4. Plasmid pUNITATCC4H is identical to pUNITATCC4, except that the stop codon of tatC is absent, and therefore the protein is produced with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. It was constructed following amplification of the cysteine-less derivative of tatC in pBluescript using primers TATCAFL and TATCH2 (32de Leeuw E. Granjon T. Porcelli I. Alami M. Carr S.B. Muller M. Sargent F. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), digestion with AflII and BglII, and cloning into pUNITAT1 that had been pre-digested with the same enzymes.A plasmid, pUNITATB, that contains the tatB gene in pBluescript was constructed following amplification of the tatB gene with primers UNIB1 (5′-GCGCGAATTCCACGTGTTTGATATCGGTTTTAGCG-3′) and UNIB2 (5′-GCGCGGATCCCTTAAGGTTTATCACTCGACGAAGG-3′), digestion with EcoRI and BamHI, and cloning into pBluescript that had been previously digested with the same enzymes. Site-specific cysteine mutations were initially introduced into the tatB gene in plasmid pUNITATB using the QuikChange™ method. Each mutation was subsequently subcloned into pUNITATCC4 for cysteine cross-linking and TMAO reductase assays. The following substitutions in the tatB gene were also subcloned into pUNITATCC4H to facilitate purification of TatC-containing complexes: L11C, V12C, and L11C plus V12C. The individual cysteine substitutions are shown in Table 1. For construction of plasmid pFATPL1112, the site-specific mutations for tatB L11C and V12C were introduced into plasmid pFAT586 using the QuikChange™ method.TABLE 1Plasmids used during this studyPlasmidRelevant characteristicMutationSourcepUNITATCC4Cysteine-less TatABC in pQE60TatC C23A (TGC → GCC); C33A (TGT → GCT); C179A (TGC → GCC); (C224A(TGT → GCT)This workTatB cysteine mutants in pUNITATCC4pUNICPC2F2CF2C(TTT→TGT)This workpUNIPLB3D3CD3C(GAT→TGT)This workpUNIPLB414C14C(ATC→TGC)This workpUNIPLB5G5CG5C(GGT→TGT)This workpUNIPLB6F6CF6C(TTT→TGT)This workpUNIPLB7S7CS7C(AGC→TGC)This workpUNIPLB8E8CE8C(GAA→TGC)This workpUNIPLB9L9CL9C(CTG→TGC)This workpUNIPLB10L10CL10C(CTA→TGT)This workpUNIPLB11L11CL11C(TTG→TGT)This workpUNIPLB12V12CV12C(GTG→TGT)This workpUNIPLB13F13CF13C(TTC→TGC)This workpUNIPLB14I14CI14C(ATC→TGC)This workpUNIPLB15I15CI15C(ATC→TGC)This workpUNIBPL16G16CG16C(GGC→TGC)This workpUNIBPL17L17CL17C(CTC→TGC)This workpUNIBPL18V18CV18C(GTC→TGC)This workpUNIBPL19V19CV19C(GTT→TGT)This workpUNIBPL20L20CL20C(CTG→TGT)This workpUNIBPL31T31CT31C(ACG→TGC)This workpUNIBPL32V32CV32C(GTA→TGC)This workpUNIBPL33A33CA33C(GCG→TGT)This workpUNIBPL34G34CG34C(GGC→TGC)This workpUNIBPL35W35CW35C(TGG→TGT)This workpUNIBPL36I36CI36C(ATT→TGT)This workpUNIBPL37R37CR37C(CGC→TGC)This workpUNIBPL38A38CA38C(GCG→TGT)This workpUNIBPL39L39CL39C(TTG→TGT)This workpUNIBPL40R40CR40C(CGT→TGT)This workpUINBPL41S41CS41C(TCA→TGC)This workpUNIBPL42L42CL42C(CTG→TGC)This workpUNIPL1112L11C, V12CL11C(TTG→TGT)This workV12C(GTG→TGT)pUNIPL1115L11C, I15CL11C(TTG→TGT)This workI15C(ATC→TGC)pUNIPL1215V12C, I15CV12C(GTG→TGT)This workI15C(ATC→TGC)pUNITATCC4HCysteine-less TatABC in pQE60.

Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,3rd Ed. Cold Spring Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Strains were normally grown at 37 °C unless otherwise stated. Concentrations of antibiotics were as described previously (6Sargent F. Bogsch E. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 30Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). For induction of plasmid-borne tatABCHis alleles, cells were initially grown to an A600 nm of 0.4–0.6. Isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG) was then added to the culture at a final concentration of 2 mm, and growth was continued for a further 6 h before harvesting.The growth phenotypes of mutants with TMAO as sole respiratory electron acceptor were determined on M9 minimal medium (33Russell D.W. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,3rd Ed. Cold Spring Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) agar plates supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 0.4% TMAO and incubated in a gas jar under a hydrogen/carbon dioxide atmosphere. The SDS-resistance phenotype of mutants was tested on LB agar plates containing 2% SDS (28Buchanan G. de Leeuw E. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For TMAO reductase assays cells were cultured in modified Cohen and Rickenberg medium (34Cohen G.N. Rickenberg H.W. Ann. Inst. Pasteur (Paris). 1956; 91: 693-720PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose and 0.4% (w/v) TMAO. Subcellular fractions for TMAO reductase assays were prepared from small (30 ml) cultures using a cold osmotic shock protocol (35Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and TMAO: benzyl viologen oxidoreductase activity was measured as described (36Silvestro A.

Spheroplasts were prepared as follows. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and then resuspended in ice-cold 33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40% (w/v) sucrose. Na2EDTA and lysozyme were added to a final concentration of 5 mm and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, and the spheroplasts were harvested at 8000 × g for 15 min. The spheroplasts were resuspended in ice-cold 33 mm Tris-HCl, 40% (w/v) sucrose. Inverted inner membrane vesicles were prepared as described (37Alami M. Trescher D. Wu L.-F. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20499-20503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).For the disulfide cross-linking experiments, strain DADE-P containing plasmids encoding TatA, TatC, and cysteine-substituted derivatives of TatB were grown overnight at 30 °C in 500-ml cultures. For disulfide cross-linking experiments where TatB was expressed in the absence of other Tat proteins, strain DADE harboring plasmid pREP4 was transformed with either pFAT586 (14de Leeuw E. Porcelli I. Sargent F. Palmer T. Berks B.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or pFATPL1112 (Table 1). 500-ml cultures of each strain were grown until an A600 of 0.6 was reached, after which expression of TatB was induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG for a further 2 h. Cells were harvested at 6000 × g for 10 min and washed with 100 ml of Buffer K (50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm Na2EDTA). After washing the cells were resuspended in 15 ml of Buffer K supplemented with DNase I, lysozyme (0.6 mg/ml), and protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Applied Science) at half a tablet per sample. Cells were disrupted by passage through a French press twice at 1000 p.s.i. The cell debris was centrifuged twice at 27,000 × g for 15 min, and the total membrane fraction was collected by ultracentrifugation of the supernatant at 206,000 × g for 90 min. Typically, the membrane pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml of Buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol), and aliquots were stored at –80 °C until use.Disulfide cross-linking experiments were carried out at room temperature for 1 h. Oxidized, reduced, and control samples were run simultaneously. A final concentration of 2 mm copper phenanthroline was used in the oxidized sample. After 1 h the reaction was quenched by the addition of 25 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 50 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.5. 10 min after quenching, the reaction volume was made up to 100 μl with the addition of SDS loading buffer (final concentration 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Reduced samples contained a final concentration of 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) as a reducing agent. After 1 h the reaction volume was made up to 100 μl with SDS loading buffer as above. The control sample, containing membrane sample and buffer only, was also made up to 100 μl with SDS loading buffer as before after the 1 h of incubation.For the purification of histidine-tagged Tat complexes, membrane fractions were treated with a freshly prepared 1 mm copper phenanthroline solution at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, any unreacted thiols were blocked by the addition of 25 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Excess cross-linking reagent and N-ethylmaleimide were removed by pelleting the cross-linked membranes at 250,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, if the samples were to be prepared under reducing conditions, the membranes were instead treated with 1 mm DTT, and the same concentration of DTT was added to all of the purification buffers. Detergent solubilization of the membranes, isolation of histidine-tagged complexes by affinity purification, and analytical size exclusion chromatography of the partially purified complexes followed methods published previously (38Porcelli I. de Leeuw E.

Palmer T. Berks B.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with minor variations. For strains expressing TatA, TatCHis, and singly cysteine-substituted TatB, membrane fractions were solubilized at a protein concentration of 5 mg ml–1 for 1 h at 4°C in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl (Buffer A) containing 1% (v/v) C12E9 (Sigma). Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 250,000 × g for 30 min, and the cleared supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-loaded 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A containing 0.1% (v/v) C12E9 and 30 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 25 ml of Buffer A containing 0.1% (v/v) C12E9, 120 mm imidazole and then developed in 20 ml of the same buffer with a linear gradient of imidazole to a final concentration of 700 mm. Fractions containing Tat proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled. The HisTrap pool was concentrated in an Amicon Ultra 4 concentration device with a 100-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore). The concentrated sample was then applied to a Superose-6 HR (1 × 30 cm inner diameter) size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A containing 0.1% (v/v) C12E9. Eluted fractions containing Tat proteins were characterized by SDS-PAGE.For the TatB L11C plus V12C variant expressed from plasmid pUNIBPL1112H, the purification protocol was the same as for the single cysteine variants with the exception that the membranes were solubilized with 2% digitonin (Merck) rather than C12E9, and the C12E9 in the column buffers was replaced with 0.1% (w/v) digitonin.SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses were as described (40Laemmli U.K. Favre M.

https://openalex.org/W2022307080,"The poor inhibitory activity of circulating antithrombin (AT) is critical to the formation of blood clots at sites of vascular damage. AT becomes an efficient inhibitor of the coagulation proteases only after binding to a specific heparin pentasaccharide, which alters the conformation of the reactive center loop (RCL). The molecular basis of this activation event lies at the heart of the regulation of hemostasis and accounts for the anticoagulant properties of the low molecular weight heparins. Although several structures of AT have been solved, the conformation of the RCL in native AT remains unknown because of the obligate crystal contact between the RCL of native AT and its latent counterpart. Here we report the crystallographic structure of a variant of AT in its monomeric native state. The RCL shifted ∼20Å, and a salt bridge was observed between the P1 residue (Arg-393) and Glu-237. This contact explains the effect of mutations at the P1 position on the affinity of AT for heparin and also the properties of AT-Truro (E237K). The relevance of the observed conformation was verified through mutagenesis studies and by solving structures of the same variant in different crystal forms. We conclude that the poor inhibitory activity of the circulating form of AT is partially conferred by intramolecular contacts that restrain the RCL, orient the P1 residue away from attacking proteases, and additionally block the exosite utilized in protease recognition.

Antithrombin (AT) 2The abbreviations used are: AT, antithrombin; RCL, reactive center loop; PEG, polyethylene glycol; SRS, Synchrotron Radiation Source. is activated by heparin through two distinct mechanisms depending on the target protease and the length of the heparin chain. Thrombin inhibition is accelerated by a simple template mechanism where heparin serves as a bridge to improve diffusion and to stabilize the Michaelis complex, whereas heparin stimulation of factor IXa and Xa inhibition depends on an AT conformational change involving the reactive center loop (RCL) (for reviews see Refs. 1Olson S.T. Chuang Y.J. Trends Cardiovasc Med. 2002; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and 2Huntington J.A. Garg H.G. Linhardt R.J. Hales C.A. Chemistry and Biology of Heparin and Heparan Sulfate. Elsevier, Oxford2005: 367-398Google Scholar). Thus, low molecular weight heparin and synthetic pentasaccharides, representing the minimal high-affinity binding sequence, are capable of stimulating the inhibition of factors IXa and Xa by two orders of magnitude but accelerate thrombin inhibition by only ∼2-fold. The slow reactivity of the circulating native form of AT is crucial in preventing bleeding, which occurs with the overdosing of therapeutic heparin, whereas the localized activation of AT is critical in preventing venous thrombosis. The molecular basis of the activation of AT is thus a subject of great interest. It is natural when considering the activation of AT to focus on the conformation of the RCL. The crystal structure of native AT revealed the partial incorporation of the very N terminus of the RCL (the hinge region) into β-sheet A (3Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R.

A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) studies later demonstrated that pentasaccharide binding induced the expulsion of the hinge region from β-sheet A (Fig. 1A). Although it was assumed that the expulsion of the hinge region would induce a conformational change in the rest of the RCL, thereby increasing its availability for proteolytic attack, the crystal structure revealed an RCL conformation identical to that of native AT (Fig. 1B). This was clearly because of a crystal contact between the active AT component and its latent counterpart, which together formed a heterodimer comprising the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1C). The stable dimerization contact involved the incorporation of RCL residues P7-P3 3The proteolytic substrate numbering scheme of Schechter and Berger (28Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar) is used, where residues N-terminal to the scissile bond are numbered from P1 and those C-terminal are numbered from P1′. of the active monomer into the vacated s1C position of the latent monomer. Native AT converts slowly to the hyperstable latent form through the incorporation of the entire RCL as the fourth strand in β-sheet A. This conformational change is possible only through the extraction of strand 1 from β-sheet C. The inevitable conversion of active AT to the latent form, coupled with the propensity of the active-latent heterodimer to crystallize, meant that crystal trials of active AT alone always resulted in crystallization of the heterodimer. The contacts between the RCL of the active monomer and the latent counterpart of the dimer were not limited to the β-sheet interaction and included residues from P8 to P3′. One such contact is a salt bridge between the P1 Arg of the active monomer to Glu-237 of the latent monomer (Fig. 1D). Although this interaction is an artifact of crystallization, there was strong evidence that the P1 Arg residue was involved in an intramolecular salt bridge in native AT (8Owen M.C. Beresford C.H. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recombinant and natural AT mutations at the P1 position showed a consistent perturbation in heparin binding affinity, consistent with a loss of a single salt bridge interaction (8Owen M.C. Beresford C.H. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9Chuang Y.J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19652-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The structures of AT did reveal an intramolecular contact between Arg-393 (P1) and Glu-255; however, the interaction was a hydrogen bond between the side chain of Arg-393 and the main chain oxygen of Glu-255 (Fig. 1D), not the predicted salt bridge. It was thus unlikely that the conformation of the RCL observed in the crystal structure of the activelatent AT heterodimer represented that of the native circulating form. Despite many efforts by members of this laboratory and others to obtain crystals of the native counterpart alone, all attempts have led only to crystals of the heterodimer because of the slow conversion of a fraction of the material to the latent form. We report here the crystal structure of a variant of AT that is fully resistant to the latent transition and thus represents the first structure of native AT in a monomeric state. Although the overall structure was similar to that observed previously, the RCL shifted ∼20 Å to make intimate intramolecular contacts with the body of AT. Included in these interactions is a salt bridge between Arg-393 and Glu-237. The relevance of the observed RCL conformation and interactions was tested by mutagenesis and by solving the structure of the mutant in other crystal forms. We conclude that the structure presented here more closely represents the main circulating conformation of AT than previous structures and explains, in molecular detail, its poor inhibitory activity. Materials—Human α-thrombin was obtained from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT), and human factor Xa was from Enzyme Research Laboratories (Swansea, UK). The physiological pentasaccharide (fondaparinux) and the hexadecasaccharide SR123781 were kindly provided by Maurice Petitou (previously of Sanofi-Synthelabo, Toulouse, France). Latent AT was produced from expired fresh-frozen plasma as described previously (11Zhou A. Stein P.E. Huntington J.A. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15116-15122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). S195A thrombin was kindly provided by Charles T. Esmon (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation). AT Expression and Purification—AT variants V317C/T401C, E237A, and E237K were constructed on the recombinant β-glycoform S137A to reduce glycosylation heterogeneity, as described previously (12Mushunje A. Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. Blood. 2003; 102: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The S137A/V317C/T401C, S137A/E237A, and S137A/E237K ATs are described in the text as V317C/T401C, E237A, and E237K, respectively. S137A AT was used throughout as the control protein. Mutagenesis, expression, and purification were conducted as described previously (13Johnson D.J. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4913-4921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All variants exhibited the same two-peak elution profile from heparin-Sepharose, and for each variant the late eluting peak was used in all experiments (14Garone L. Edmunds T. Hanson E. Bernasconi R. Huntington J.A. Meagher J.L. Fan B. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8881-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Purified material was stored at -80 °C. The concentration of AT was determined by absorbance at 280 nm and verified by stoichiometric titrations of 1 μm AT against a known concentration of pentasaccharide. Active concentrations corresponded to those determined by absorbance for all variants studied. The absence of significant amounts of inactive material was confirmed by an ability to form a stoichiometric complex with thrombin by SDS-PAGE. Rate of Latency Transition—Control and V317C/T401C ATs were incubated at 50 °C in 50 mm NaPO4, 40% glycerol, pH 6.0 (conditions that promote transition to the latent form but limit polymer formation), and at the indicated times, samples were removed, snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Remaining thrombin inhibitory activity was assessed for all time points in a 96-well plate as described previously (13Johnson D.J. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4913-4921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of V317C/T401C AT were grown in hanging drops containing 2 μl of AT (7.4 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris pH 7.4) and 1 μl of precipitant solution (0.13 m NaI, 13% PEG 3350). After dehydration in increasing concentrations of PEG 3350 from 13 to 25% a single crystal was cryoprotected in 0.13 m NaI, 25% PEG 3350, 10% PEG 400 prior to mounting in a cryoloop and cooling in a vapor nitrogen stream to 100 K. The crystal was then annealed by blocking the nitrogen stream for 10 s. Data were collected from a single crystal at SRS Daresbury Station 9.6 (λ = 0.87Å) on an ADSC Quantum 4 detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). V317C/T401C was also crystallized as a dimer with latent AT. Hanging drops were set up containing 2 μl of AT (10 mg/ml V317C/T401C, 10 mg/ml latent AT in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and 2 μl of precipitant (17.5% PEG 4000, 50 mm Na/KPO4 pH 6.7). A single crystal was cryoprotected by passing the crystal sequentially into solutions containing 0-16% glycerol with 20% PEG 4000, 50 mm Na/KPO4 pH 6.7. Data sets were collected from a single crystal at SRS Daresbury Station 14.1 (λ = 1.488Å), on a ADSC Quantum 4 detector. Crystals of the V317C/T401C variant in the presence of heparin mimetic SR123781 and S195A thrombin were grown from 1:1 drops of protein (6.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, 210 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and precipitant (0.16 m ammonium sulfate, 16% PEG 3350, 10% glycerol). The crystal was cryoprotected in 16% PEG 3350, 0.16 m ammonium sulfate, and 20% glycerol. A data set was collected from a single flash-cooled crystal after annealing by blocking the vapor nitrogen stream three times for 3 s followed by a single 10-s annealing (SRS Station 9.6). Resolution improved from ∼2.9 to 2.6 Å for the 3-s annealings and to 2.1 Å after the 10-s annealing. Data Processing and Structure Refinement—Data were processed using Mosflm, Scala, and Truncate (15Leslie A.W.G. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, No. 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar). The monomeric AT structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program MolRep (16Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

After rigid body refinement, strict non-crystallographic symmetry was applied for refinement and rebuilding followed by restrained non-crystallographic symmetry for one round of refinement. The structure of the nonproductive AT-thrombinheparin complex was solved using MolRep, with S195A thrombin (Protein Data Bank ID code 1JOU, molecule AB (18Huntington J.A. Esmon C.T. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 469-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) and pentasaccharide-bound AT (Protein Data Bank ID code 1E03) as search models. The heterodimeric structure of the V317C/T401C variant and latent AT was solved by simply conducting rigid body refinement on the protein component of 1E04. All refinement was conducted using the program CNS (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4913-4921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The stoichiometries of inhibition were indistinguishable from one for all AT variants. Rate constants were averaged from at least three determinations. Heparin Binding Studies—Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined essentially as described previously (13Johnson D.J. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4913-4921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, the intrinsic fluorescence of AT (15-50 nm) with increasing concentrations of pentasaccharide was measured at 340 nm, exciting at a wavelength of 280 nm, on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B spectrofluorimeter at room temperature. All solutions were made up in 20 mm NaPO4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4 (I = 0.15), and the NaCl concentration was increased to 250 mm to obtain an ionic strength of 0.3. Thermal Denaturation Studies—The midpoints of thermal denaturation were taken as the X intercept of the second derivative of smoothed melts monitored by circular dichroism. Protein solutions at 0.8 mg/ml in 20 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, were subjected to a temperature ramp from 25 to 90 °C on a Peltier controlled Jasco 815 spectropolarimeter, and ellipticity was monitored at a wavelength of 222 nm. At least three runs were averaged. Disulfide Bond Prevents Latent Transition—To prevent the conversion of active AT to the inactive latent form, we engineered a disulfide bond between strands 1 and 2 in β-sheet C. Adjacent residues Val-317 and Thr-401 were mutated to Cys, and as predicted, the resultant disulfide bond prevented conversion to the latent form (Fig. 2A). Correct formation of the disulfide bond was also verified by solving the crystal structure of the variant in presence of latent AT. The disulfide bond was observed in the predicted position, and in the context of the heterodimer, the new disulfide bond did not perturb the conformation of strands 1 or 2 of β-sheet C or of the adjacent RCL (Fig. 2B). The V317C/T401C mutations did, however, have a subtle effect on the activity of the AT variant (Table 2). The pentasaccharide affinity of the variant was decreased by ∼2-fold, and the basal rates of thrombin and factor Xa inhibition were both reduced by ∼5-fold. The pentasaccharide-accelerated rates were also reduced by 1.6- and 3.8-fold for thrombin and factor Xa, respectively. As the properties of the individual cysteine variants were not determined, it was unclear whether the small reduction in activity was caused by the point mutations or the formation of the novel disulfide bond. The thermal stability of the variant was slightly increased relative to control (1.5 °C). A similar increase in Tm for another AT variant also resulted in a small loss of heparin affinity (5Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the region in which the mutations were made (s1C and s2C) is known from crystal structures to be in close contact with proteases in Michaelis complexes with AT (23Johnson D.J. Li W. Adams T.E. Huntington J.A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Li W. Johnson D.J. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol.

It is thus unsurprising that these mutations had a small effect on the rates of protease inhibition.TABLE 2Biochemical properties of AT variantsAntithrombinPentasaccharide binding (Kd)PentaRates of inhibition (kapp)I = 0.15I = 0.30ThrombinFactor Xanmm−1 s−1Control3.5 ± 0.326 ± 0.3−7.3 ± 0.4 × 1034.9 ± 0.5 × 103+1.10 ± 0.06 × 1047.0 ± 0.3 × 105V317C/T401C7.1 ± 1.162 ± 0.3−1.47 ± 0.04 × 1039.6 ± 0.7 × 102+6.9 ± 0.2 × 1031.86 ± 0.09 × 105E237A1.8 ± 0.115 ± 3−1.4 ± 0.1 × 1047.6 ± 0.5 × 103+1.4 ± 0.2 × 1046.4 ± 0.4 × 105E237K2.0 ± 0.113.5 ± 0.7−2.3 ± 0.2 × 1041.4 ± 0.1 × 104+1.9 ± 0.2 × 1047.5 ± 0.3 × 105 Open table in a new tab Crystal Structure of Monomeric AT—The structure of monomeric AT was solved from a single crystal, and data processing and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The data were of good quality up to 2.75 Å resolution, and three monomers were found in the asymmetric unit. Due to the presence of pseudo symmetry, the three monomers were identical, and strict noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were used until the last round of refinement. The overall structure is similar to the previous structure of native AT (Protein Data Bank ID code 1E04), with a root mean squared deviation of 1.8 Å for 416 equivalent Cα atoms. However, significant differences were observed in the heparin biding region and the RCL (Fig. 3A). Based on the structures of AT solved from crystals of the active/latent dimer, it was thought that the local conformational response to pentasaccharide binding was the elongation of helices A and D and the formation of a new helix P on the N-terminal helix D loop. However, in the structure of the monomeric form of native, AT we found that helix A was already elongated and that helix P was preformed. These apparent conformational differences probably reflect the inherent flexibility of the heparin binding site in native AT and are likely to be influenced by crystal contacts. The RCL of monomeric AT is found partially incorporated into β-sheet A, as with other structures of native AT, but the remainder of the RCL has shifted position significantly. The P1 Arg-393 residue has shifted 17 Å toward the left in the classical view, and the side chain is oriented toward the body of AT making stabilizing contacts. The electron density of the RCL, shown in Fig. 3B, demonstrates the unequivocal placement of the Arg 393 side chain. Although the P1 Arg 393 makes only a single intramolecular hydrogen bond in the context of the AT heterodimer (Fig. 1D), in monomeric AT the P1 side chain participates in a salt bridge with Glu-237 and a hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen of Asn-233 (Fig. 3C). The side chain of Arg-393 is in fact buried in a hydrophobic pocket described by Arg-235 and Tyr-253, in a position similar to that observed for Arg-150 of factor Xa in the crystal structure of the AT-factor Xa-pentasaccharide Michaelis complex (23Johnson D.J. Li W. Adams T.E. Huntington J.A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The interaction interface between the RCL (residues 383-395) and the body of AT is 628 Å2, 27% of which is accounted for by the burying of Arg-393. Another Crystal Form Reveals Similar RCL Conformation and Contacts—Although biochemical studies have established that the hinge region of AT is expelled from β-sheet A upon binding to its specific heparin pentasaccharide, we previously reported a structure of an AT-pentasaccharide complex in which the hinge region is in a native-like state (26Johnson D.J. Huntington J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8712-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This “intermediate” structure was solved in the context of the active/latent heterodimer, and thus the RCL was in the same conformation observed for other AT structures. In pursuit of crystals of the ternary complex between AT, S195A thrombin, and heparin, we solved a highresolution structure (2.1 Å) in which the RCL of AT did not interact with thrombin and the hinge region was inserted into β-sheet A in a native-like fashion (Fig. 4). This serendipitous structure was not useful for the understanding of how thrombin recognizes AT, but it did provide us with a crystal structure of the V317C/T401C AT variant with a native-like RCL in a different crystal form. The conformation of the RCL was similar to that observed in the native monomeric structure (Fig. 4B), with the P1 residue engaged in similar interactions. The salt bridge with Glu-237 and the hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen of Asn-233 were both observed, strengthening the conclusion that these interactions are sampled in native wild-type AT and were not due to specific crystal contacts. Properties of AT Variants Support the Observed Salt Bridge between Arg-393 and Glu-237—Several P1 variants of AT have been characterized, and in each case that Arg-393 was substituted with a neutral amino acid, a small (2-4-fold) increase in heparin affinity resulted (8Owen M.C. Beresford C.H. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This was presumably because the energetic cost of breaking a salt bridge between the P1 Arg and the body of AT was relieved (8Owen M.C. Beresford C.H. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We can predict from the structure of AT in its monomeric form that charge neutralizing mutations on Glu-237 should mimic the effect observed for the P1 variants. In addition to the predicted increase in heparin affinity, we should also observe a small increase in rate of thrombin and factor Xa inhibition, reflecting the greater accessibility of the P1 Arg. We thus created E237A and E237K variants of AT and tested their heparin binding and inhibitory properties (Table 2). As predicted, we observed an ∼2-fold increase in pentasaccharide binding affinity for both variants; the second-order rate constants of protease inhibition in the absence of heparin were also increased by ∼2-fold. Interestingly, thrombin inhibition was not further accelerated by the pentasaccharide for the two variants, suggesting that the change in P1 accessibility normally caused by the binding of the pentasaccharide is already fully realized for the E237A and E237K variants. The similar magnitude of increase in pentasaccharide affinity through neutralization of either Arg-393 or Glu-237 supports their joint involvement in a salt bridge in native AT. Our effort to determine the crystal structure of native AT in its monomeric state required a strategy to prevent the conformational transition to the latent form. We thus designed and demonstrated the formation of a disulfide bond between residue 317 on strand 2C and residue 401 on strand 1C, which prevented any loss of activity upon prolonged incubation at elevated temperature. Diffraction-quality crystals of this variant were obtained, and a new RCL conformation was observed in the resulting structure. However, the conformations of protein surface loops, such as the RCL of serpins, are generally susceptible to the influence of crystal contacts, and an observed conformation should be considered to represent only one of the possible solution conformers and not necessarily the predominant solution conformer. Therefore, several experimental approaches were undertaken to test the relevance of the RCL conformation and contacts observed in the structure of monomeric AT. One measure of the stability of an observed loop conformation is the B-factors of the main chain and side chain atoms, which give an indication of the flexibility of the residues that make up the surface loop. Interestingly, the B-factors for the RCL of the monomeric variant are higher than average from P12 to P2, but return to normal at the P1, suggesting that the side chain interactions observed for Arg-393 serve to anchor the RCL. This is consistent with the serendipitous structure of the same variant in another crystal form, which showed similar interactions between the side chain of Arg-393 with the same residues on the body of AT, despite a small shift in the position of the RCL. In addition, this structure demonstrates that AT adopts a very similar RCL conformation and forms the same interactions under the influence of different crystal contacts. These observations suggest that the N terminus of the RCL of native AT is somewhat flexible and that the contacts we observed between the side chain of Arg-393 and the body of AT serve to anchor the C-terminal portion of the RCL. However, the appreciable rates of protease inhibition for AT in the absence of activating heparin suggest that the P1 residue is at least partially available for proteolytic attack in native AT. The RCL of native AT thus probably exists in an equilibrium between at least two states, one with a buried and inaccessible P1 side chain and another with a fully solvent-accessible Arg-393 (Fig. 5). A model for such a conformational equilibrium was proposed in an elegant paper by Steve Olson and colleagues (9Chuang Y.J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) explaining the heparin binding properties of various P1 variants (similar to Fig. 5). One of the interesting properties of P1 variants is the absolute dependence on charge but not on other properties such as hydrophobicity or potential for hydrogen bonding. Whether His, Leu, Pro, or Trp, all P1 mutations lead to an ∼2-fold increase in heparin affinity (8Owen M.C. Beresford C.H. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The R393H variant (AT Glasgow) is of particular interest, because below the pKa of His, where the side chain is positively charged, the affinity returns to normal (8Owen M.C. Beresford C.H.

Similarly, the deimination of P1 Arg leads to a 2-fold increase in affinity, even though the resulting isosteric citrulline side chain contains strong hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups (10Pike R.N. Potempa J. Skinner R. Fitton H.L. McGraw W.T. Travis J. Owen M. Jin L. Carrell R.W. J. Biol.

As the activated state, by definition, must have an accessible P1 side chain, the properties of the P1 variants of AT strongly indicate the presence of an intramolecular salt bridge in native AT. The strikingly similar increase in heparin affinity upon neutralization (or reversal) of the negative charge on Glu-237 suggests a direct Arg-393/Glu-237 interaction. The crystal structures presented here reveal a direct salt bridge interaction between Arg-393 and Glu-237 and fully explain the mutagenesis data. In addition, the observed contact explains the previously enigmatic increase in heparin affinity observed for the naturally occurring variant AT-Truro (E237K) (27Whisstock J.C. Pike R.N. Jin L.

In conclusion, we have presented three structures of an AT variant, which because of an engineered disulfide bond, is resistant to the latent transition. In two unrelated crystals we observed similar interactions between the body of AT and the side chain of the reactive center residue Arg-393. Because the orientation of the P1 residue is of primary importance for recognition of the RCL by target proteases (in the absence of heparin (9Chuang Y.J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), the observed contacts help explain the poor inhibitory activity of circulating native AT. In addition, the site with which the P1 residue interacts in native AT is the principal exosite for factor IXa and Xa recognition (23Johnson D.J. Li W. Adams T.E. Huntington J.A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), further contributing to the low basal rate of protease inhibition. Our data support the hypothesis that the RCL of native AT exists in dynamic equilibrium between at least two conformations (Fig. 5), one in which the P1 side chain is free from intramolecular contacts and can be recognized by proteases and another in which the RCL is anchored by the specific Arg-393 interactions observed in the crystal structure of monomeric AT described here.

https://openalex.org/W2031502391,"Although activation of outward rectifying Cl– channels is one of the fastest responses of endothelial cells (ECs) to shear stress, little is known about these channels. In this study, we used whole-cell patch clamp recordings to characterize the flow-activated Cl– current in bovine aortic ECs (BAECs). Application of shear stress induced rapid development of a Cl– current that was effectively blocked by the Cl– channel antagonist 5-nitro-2-(3-phenopropylamino)benzoic acid (100 μm). The current initiated at a shear stress as low as 0.3 dyne/cm2, attained its peak within minutes of flow onset, and saturated above 3.5 dynes/cm2 (∼2.5–3.5-fold increase over pre-flow levels). The Cl– current desensitized slowly in response to sustained flow, and step increases in shear stress elicited increased current only if the shear stress levels were below the 3.5 dynes/cm2 saturation level. Oscillatory flow with a physiological oscillation frequency of 1 Hz, as occurs in disturbed flow zones prone to atherosclerosis, failed to elicit the Cl– current, whereas lower oscillation frequencies led to partial recovery of the current. Nonreversing pulsatile flow, generally considered protective of atherosclerosis, was as effective in eliciting the current as steady flow. Measurements using fluids of different viscosities indicated that the Cl– current is responsive to shear stress rather than shear rate.

The responsiveness of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) 2The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; cP, centipoise; NPPB, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenopropylamino)benzoic acid. to fluid mechanical shear forces is essential for vasoregulation and arterial wall remodeling (1Pohl U.

Science. 1986; 231: 405-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fact that ECs respond differently to different types of shear stress is likely the basis for the localization of early atherosclerotic lesions in arterial regions exposed to low and/or oscillatory shear stress (3Nerem R.M.

Although much has been learned about endothelial signaling pathways activated by flow (5Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar, 7Li Y.S. Haga J.H. Chien S. J. Biomech. 2005; 38: 1949-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), the early events involved in shear stress sensing and initiation of flow-mediated signaling remain incompletely understood. Activation of flow-sensitive ion channels is one of the most rapid endothelial responses to shear stress; therefore, these channels have been proposed as candidate flow sensors (5Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar, 8Barakat A.I. Lieu D.K. Gojova A. Biomaterials. 2006; 27: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Sudden exposure of ECs to shear stress immediately activates inward-rectifying K+ channels, leading to cell membrane hyperpolarization (9Olesen S.P. Clapham D.E. Davies P.F.

Simultaneously, flow stimulates outward-rectifying Cl– channels whose activation antagonizes the K+ channel-mediated hyperpolarization and leads to membrane depolarization (11Barakat A.I. Leaver E.V.

Although characteristics of flowsensitive K+ channels, including their unitary conductance, dependence on the magnitude of applied shear stress, and regulation, have been reported in previous studies (9Olesen S.P.

Shear stress rapidly phosphorylates the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also called protein kinase B or Rac kinase) (15Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 16Go Y.M. Boo Y.C. Park H. Maland M.C. Patel R. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Darley-Usmar V. Jo H. J. Appl.

Akt phosphorylation regulates endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activation, integrin-mediated signaling, matrix adhesion, and suppression of cell apoptosis (17Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The mechanisms governing Akt activation by shear stress are not known. In this study, we used the whole-cell patch clamp technique in bovine aortic ECs (BAECs) to establish the sensitivity of the flow-activated Cl– current to the amplitude of applied shear stress, probe the desensitization characteristics of the current, investigate the responsiveness of the current to sudden changes in shear stress, and demonstrate that the current is responsive to shear stress rather than shear rate. We also show that the Cl– current regulates shear stress-induced Akt phosphorylation. Cell Culture and Flow Experiments—BAECs procured from Cell Systems Corp. (Kirkland, WA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 nutrient media supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA) and used in passage 4–7. For patch clamp experiments, cells were plated in 1 × 1-mm square cross-section borosilicate glass capillary tubes (Vitrocom, Mountain Lakes, NJ). As detailed elsewhere (20Wiesner T.F. Berk B.C. Nerem R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3726-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), this flow system allows determination of the shear stress to which BAECs are exposed during recording. Cells located near one end of the capillary tube were used for patch clamp recordings, whereas the other end was connected to a syringe pump (Cole Parmer) capable of generating either steady or purely oscillatory flow (zero net flow rate) at prescribed flow rates (and hence known wall shear stresses) and frequencies. Nonreversing pulsatile flow was generated by combining the outputs of a syringe pump supplying steady flow with another syringe pump supplying oscillatory flow. Western Blot Analysis for Akt Phosphorylation—For Akt studies, BAECs were plated on tissue culture-treated plastic slides (Permanox, Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and starved for 12 h prior to experiments in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA) and 1% penicillin (10,000 IU/ml) and streptomycin (10,000 μg/ml). Steady and oscillatory flow Akt studies were performed in a parallel plate flow chamber as described elsewhere (21Suvatne J. Barakat A.I. O'Donnell M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C216-C227Crossref Google Scholar). Flow periods ranged from 5 to 60 min. After removal from the flow chamber, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then disrupted with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate (MP Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH), 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm microcystin (MP Biomedicals Inc.). The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of each sample supernatant was determined by the modified Lowry's method (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were incubated (1 h at room temperature) with phospho-specific polyclonal antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated site Ser(P)473 in Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). After incubation with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG), the blots were incubated with SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. The membranes were then stripped with Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and re-probed with total Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) as an internal control. Densities of the bands were analyzed using Kodak 1D image analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Band densities of phosphorylated Akt were expressed relative to the density of the total Akt level. Electrophysiological Measurements—Cl– currents from BAECs were recorded using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique. Currents were recorded by applying the following voltage ramp protocol; the voltage was maintained at a holding potential of –70 mV for 30 ms, followed by a step to +100 mV for 40 ms, followed by a ramp to –150 mV over 400 ms, and then a step back to the holding potential. The interramp interval was 5 s. Currents were recorded for 40 s before flow onset to ensure a stable pre-flow base line. For data analyses, all currents were normalized to the “pre-flow” current value measured immediately prior to flow initiation. After making whole-cell capacitance compensation, the currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier running pCLAMP9 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Acquired currents were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 2 kHz. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubing (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) and heat-polished at the tip to give a resistance of 2–3 megohms when filled with pipette solution. Reagents and Solutions—Unless otherwise stated, chemicals were purchased from Sigma. For patch clamp experiments, the external solution contained the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose, pH 7.4, with 1 m NaOH. The pipette (internal) solution contained the following (in mm): 140 cesium glutamate (to block flow-activated K+ channels), 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 EGTA, pH 7.4, with 1 m CsOH. Both internal and external solutions had measured osmolarities of ∼310 mOsm. In some experiments, the viscosity of the external solution was increased using dextran (Mr = 100,000–200,000) and was measured using a Cannon-Fenske routine viscometer (Industrial Research Glassware Ltd., Roselle, NJ). The viscosities of solutions containing 0, 5, and 10% dextran were 0.95, 2.8, and 6.62 cP, respectively. Data Analyses and Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Patch clamp data analyses were carried out using Clampfit (Axon Instruments) and Origin 7 software (Northampton, MA). For patch clamp data, statistical comparison of means was performed using either the Wilcoxon matched pairs test and one-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc test (multi-group comparison) or unpaired t test (two-group comparison in Fig. 7). For Western blots, one-way repeated-measure analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc test was used to compare the means. Activation of Cl– Current by Steady Shear Stress—In virtually all BAECs patched, steady shear stress elicited whole-cell outward currents that initiated immediately upon flow onset and developed relatively slowly (Fig. 1, A and B). We had demonstrated in previous studies that the flow-induced outward current is Cl–-specific (11Barakat A.I. Leaver E.V. Pappone P.A. Davies P.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 820-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12Lieu D.K. Pappone P.A. Barakat A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1367-C1375Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in this study; in the presence of the Cl– channel blocker NPPB (100 μm), the flow-induced current was completely inhibited (Fig. 1, C and D). The flow-activated inward-rectifying K+ current (10Nakache M. Gaub H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1841-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Jacobs E.R. Cheliakine C. Gebremedhin D. Birks E.K. Davies P.F. Harder D.R. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 431: 129-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) was not observed because all recordings were performed in the presence of the K+ channel blocker cesium in the pipette solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). Effect of Shear Stress Magnitude on Cl– Current—To determine the sensitivity of the flow-activated Cl– current to shear stress magnitude, the current amplitude induced by a 2-min application of a steady shear stress in the range 0.3–14 dynes/cm2 was recorded. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, a shear stress as small as 0.3 dyne/cm2 elicited a Cl– current whose peak amplitude was significantly larger than pre-flow levels (1.2 ± 0.06-fold increase; p < 0.05). Shear stresses of 1.1 and 3.5 dynes/cm2 led to further progressive increases in the Cl– current to 1.7 ± 0.2 and 2.3 ± 0.3 times pre-flow levels, respectively. The current saturated above 3.5 dynes/cm2 as shear stresses of 7 and 14 dynes/cm2 failed to elicit larger currents. Desensitization Characteristics of Cl– Current—The experiments described thus far involved exposure of BAECs to short flow episodes. To probe possible desensitization of the flow-activated Cl– current in response to sustained flow, we performed recordings on BAECs subjected to a steady shear stress of 3.5 dynes/cm2 for a period of 10 min. This shear stress level was selected because it corresponds to maximal current activation (Fig. 2B). In the presence of sustained flow, the Cl– current attained a peak 208 ± 27 s (range 105–395 s) after flow initiation and then began desensitizing; however, the extent of desensitization varied among cells (Fig. 3A). To quantify this variability, we define a dimensionless “desensitization index” (DI) as DI = |(If – Ii)/(Im – Ii)|, where If and Ii, respectively, denote the normalized Cl– current at the end and beginning of the 10-min recording period, and Im denotes the maximum normalized current during the recording period. Thus, DI ranges from 0 to 1 with DI = 0 denoting complete desensitization, and DI = 1 indicating no desensitization. As illustrated in the histogram in Fig. 3B, the desensitization was very pronounced (DI < 0.25) in 6 of 13 cells. In 3 cells, the desensitization was moderate (0.25 ≤ DI ≤ 0.75). Finally, in the remaining 4 cells, the desensitization was modest (DI > 0.75). Response of Cl– Current to Step Changes in Shear Stress—In all experiments thus far, BAECs were subjected to a single shear stress level. Because shear stress levels in vivo can change suddenly in response to changes in stress and/or activity level, we studied the response of the flow-activated Cl– current to step changes in shear stress. The cells were subjected to three consecutive and progressively increasing shear stress levels, each of which was imposed for 120 s. Flow was interrupted briefly (10 s) between shear stress steps to change flow rate settings. Because of the shear stress dependence of the Cl– current (Fig. 2B), two sets of step flow experiments were conducted as follows: the first at shear stresses that elicit submaximal current where the cells were subjected to steps of 0.3, 1.1, and 3.5 dynes/cm2; the second set at shear stresses that induce maximal current where the cells were exposed to steps of 3.5, 7, and 14 dynes/cm2. The results demonstrate that the Cl– current response to step changes in shear stress is different for the two sets of experiments. For the first set, where the shear stresses were below the level that elicits maximal current, the amplitude of the Cl– current increased with each step in shear stress (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, recordings from the second set, where the shear stresses were above the level that induces maximal current, demonstrated current desensitization following the first flow stimulus and consequent insensitivity to subsequent shear stress steps (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that flow-activated Cl– currents in ECs respond to sudden changes in shear stress only if the shear stress levels are below those eliciting maximal current. Response of Cl– Current to Repeated Flow Episodes—Under certain conditions in vivo, such as during ischemia-reperfusion, ECs experience an interruption in flow followed by flow resumption. To probe the impact of such a situation on the flow-activated Cl– current, we recorded the current in BAECs subjected to two 2-min flow episodes separated by a 160-s no-flow period. For all experiments, the shear stress associated with the first flow episode was 3.5 dynes/cm2, whereas the shear stress for the second episode was 3.5, 7, or 14 dynes/cm2. The results indicate that in all cases, the first flow episode elicited a significant current (∼2–3.5-fold increase above pre-flow levels) consistent with the results presented above (Fig. 2B). The second flow episode, however, stimulated a significant current only when it was at a higher shear stress than the first episode (Fig. 5). Whenever a Cl– current was stimulated by the second flow episode, its magnitude was significantly smaller than that triggered by the first flow episode. It should be noted that the 160-s flow interruption period between flow episodes was often not sufficiently long for the current to have dropped back to pre-flow base-line levels; therefore, the Cl– channels were in recovery mode from the first flow stimulus when they were exposed to the second stimulus. These results indicate that in the case of repeated flow stimulation, the Cl– current becomes desensitized after the first episode and is therefore not responsive to a second flow cycle at the same shear stress level as the first, whereas a second cycle at a higher shear stress does elicit limited current. Response of Cl– Current to Unsteady Shear Stress—Flow in large arteries is pulsatile; therefore, arterial ECs are exposed to highly unsteady flow. Although most arterial sites experience nonreversing pulsatile flow, flow in local regions near branches and bifurcations may be purely oscillatory. Interestingly, arterial sites subjected to oscillatory flow are especially prone to the development of early atherosclerotic lesions, whereas regions exposed to nonreversing pulsatile flow remain largely spared (3Nerem R.M. J. Biomech. Eng. 1992; 114: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 4Ku D.N. Giddens D.P. Zarins C.K. Glagov S. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the effects of a steady shear stress of 3.5 dynes/cm2, a 1-Hz nonreversing pulsatile shear stress of 3.5 ± 3.5 dynes/cm2, and an oscillatory shear stress of 0 ± 3.5 dynes/cm2 with frequencies in the range 0.04–1 Hz on the flow-activated Cl– current. The results show that both steady and nonreversing pulsatile flow induced significant and comparable Cl– currents in BAECs (Fig. 6). More specifically, steady flow led to a peak current whose amplitude was 2.3 ± 0.3-fold that of the pre-flow current, whereas the equivalent value for nonreversing pulsatile flow was 2.5 ± 0.3. On the other hand, the effect of oscillatory flow depended on the frequency of oscillation. Although oscillatory flow with a physiological frequency of 1 Hz failed to elicit the Cl– current (normalized current of 1.1 ± 0.1), subphysiological frequencies of 0.04 and 0.2 Hz elicited significant currents (1.4 ± 0.1 and 1.7 ± 0.2, respectively), although this current was smaller than that activated by either steady or 1-Hz nonreversing pulsatile flow. Cl– Channel Responsiveness to Shear Stress Versus Shear Rate—We asked whether the activation of Cl– channels by flow was a result of the “direct” impact of the fluid mechanical force on the channels or channel-associated structures (a shear stress effect) or an “indirect” effect of flow on the delivery and/or removal of soluble factors to the cell surface (a shear rate effect). To address this question, we measured Cl– currents induced by steady flow at a given flow rate after changing the viscosity of the external solution using different dextran concentrations. This approach has been used previously to demonstrate that the extent of intracellular calcium mobilization in ECs correlates with shear stress rather than shear rate (23Ando J. Ohtsuka A. Korenaga R. Kawamura T. Kamiya A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Maintaining the flow rate constant with solutions of different viscosities maintains the same shear rate while providing different shear stress levels. The following three types of solution were used: 0% dextran (normal external solution) whose viscosity was measured as 0.95 cP, 5% dextran solution (2.8 cP), and 10% dextran solution (6.6 cP). The results demonstrate that the magnitude of flow-induced Cl– current correlates with shear stress rather than shear rate (Fig. 7). For instance, whereas a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min in 0% dextran solution (corresponding to a shear rate of 0.3 s–1 and a shear stress of 0.3 dyne/cm2) elicits minimal current (1.2 ± 0.1-fold increase over pre-flow levels), the same shear rate in 10% dextran solution (shear stress of 2.1 dynes/cm2) induces a significantly larger current (2.4 ± 0.3-fold increase). Similarly, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (shear rate of 1.2 s–1), a shear stress of 1.1 dynes/cm2 elicits a smaller current than either 3.5 or 7 dynes/cm2. As expected, the currents induced by 3.5 and 7 dynes/cm2 are similar because both these levels are above the saturation level defined earlier (Fig. 2B). Physiological Implications of Shear Stress-induced Cl– Channel Activation—To understand the role of flow-sensitive Cl– channels in regulating downstream flow responses in ECs, we probed the involvement of these channels in shear stress-induced Akt phosphorylation. BAECs exposed to a steady shear stress of 15 dynes/cm2 for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min exhibited a time-dependent change in Akt phosphorylation at the site Ser473 (Fig. 8A). After 5 min of flow, Akt phosphorylation increased 3.8 ± 0.9-fold relative to cells in static culture. This value remained essentially constant (3.5 ± 0.8) 15 min after the onset of flow but eventually decreased to base-line levels by 60 min. At all time points except 60 min, Akt phosphorylation levels were significantly higher than those of static control (p < 0.05). These results are similar to those reported previously (16Go Y.M. Boo Y.C. Park H. Maland M.C. Patel R. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Darley-Usmar V. Jo H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1574-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To test the involvement of flow-sensitive Cl– channels in shear stress-induced Akt phosphorylation, we studied Akt phosphorylation in BAECs subjected to 1-Hz oscillatory flow which, as already shown (Fig. 6), fails to elicit the Cl– current. A shear stress of 0 ± 15 dynes/cm2 applied for 5–60 min resulted in a significantly smaller increase in Akt phosphorylation than that induced by steady flow (Fig. 8B). More specifically, at the 5-min time point, oscillatory flow elicited a 1.7 ± 0.2-fold increase in Akt phosphorylation (versus 3.8 ± 0.9 for steady flow, p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained at the 15- and 30-min time points (1.5 ± 0.2 versus 3.5 ± 0.8, p < 0.05; 1.3 ± 0.1 versus 3.2 ± 0.5, p < 0.05). These results support an involvement of flow-sensitive Cl– channels in the regulation of shear stress-induced Akt phosphorylation. We also probed the impact of NPPB (100 μm), which blocks flow-activated Cl– channels (Fig. 1), on shear stress-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 8C). Application of a steady shear stress of 15 dynes/cm2 for 15 min in the presence of NPPB induced only a 1.6 ± 0.4-fold increase in Akt phosphorylation relative to control cells in static culture versus a 3.1 ± 0.9-fold increase in the absence of NPPB (p < 0.05). On the other hand, blocking flow-sensitive K+ channels with Ba2+ (100 μm) had no effect on shear stress-induced Akt phosphorylation (4.5 ± 1.4-fold increase relative to control cells in static culture in the presence of Ba2+ versus 3.9 ± 1.2 in the absence of Ba2+, p > 0.05). Incubating the cells in the ion channel blockers in the absence of flow had no impact on Akt phosphorylation. These observations further support a role for flow-sensitive Cl– channels (but not K+ channels) in regulating shear stress-induced Akt phosphorylation in BAECs. Flow-sensitive ion channels play an important role in shear stress sensing in vascular endothelium (5Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar, 8Barakat A.I. Lieu D.K. Gojova A. Biomaterials. 2006; 27: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have shown that flow-activated Cl– channels are stimulated immediately upon the onset of flow and that activation of these channels leads to EC membrane depolarization that antagonizes K+ channel-mediated hyperpolarization (11Barakat A.I. Leaver E.V. Pappone P.A. Davies P.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 820-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), little is known about the sensitivity of these channels to shear stress and the physiological implications of their activation. In this study, we used whole-cell patch clamp recordings to characterize the dependence of the Cl– current in BAECs on the level and type of applied shear stress, the desensitization kinetics of the current, and the responsiveness of the current to steps in shear stress as well as to repeated shear stress episodes. We also studied the role of this current in regulating shear stress-induced Akt phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that flow-sensitive Cl– channels are activated by a shear stress as small as 0.3 dyne/cm2, a value largely similar to that previously reported for flow-activated K+ channels (9Olesen S.P. Clapham D.E. Davies P.F. Nature. 1988; 331: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). However, unlike the K+ current that saturates at ∼10–15 dynes/cm2, Cl– current saturation occurs at ∼3.5 dynes/cm2. In medium and large arteries, the mean physiological shear stress in regions of undisturbed flow is ∼10–20 dynes/cm2, and the mean shear stress in disturbed flow regions that are prone to atherosclerosis is considerably lower (0–5 dynes/cm2) (3Nerem R.M. J. Biomech. Eng. 1992; 114: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 4Ku D.N. Giddens D.P. Zarins C.K. Glagov S. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that the difference in saturation shear stress between Cl– and K+ channels may point to a system where the two channels function cooperatively to provide sensitivity to a broader shear stress range than would either channel alone. Within this context, Cl– channels would be primarily responsible for sensing relatively low shear stress levels, whereas K+ channels would sense relatively high shear stress levels. Our results also demonstrate that although the Cl– current initiates immediately upon flow onset, it develops slowly and attains its peak only after ∼200 s. The slow development of flow-sensitive Cl– currents is consistent with the observation made in previous studies (11Barakat A.I. Leaver E.V. Pappone P.A. Davies P.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 820-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12Lieu D.K. Pappone P.A. Barakat A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1367-C1375Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that although both K+ and Cl– channels are activated immediately upon the onset of flow, K+ channel-mediated membrane hyperpolarization precedes Cl– channel-mediated depolarization, despite the larger electrochemical gradient for Cl– than for K+. In response to sustained flow, BAECs exhibit varying degrees of Cl– current desensitization. The basis for the variability in desensitization behavior among cells remains to be determined but is not related to cell passage or time in culture. Indeed, it is unclear if the limited Cl– current desensitization observed in some cells reflects a fundamental difference in these cells or simply slower desensitization dynamics. In principle, recording Cl– currents in cells subjected to even longer periods of sustained flow than those used here would address this question; however, this is logistically impractical because of the difficulty in maintaining a whole-cell seal for longer time periods. In other systems, there is evidence for the existence of cellular subpopulations exhibiting different desensitization characteristics. For instance, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in rat sympathetic ganglion neurons exhibit rapid desensitization in 90% of the cells, whereas the remaining 10% show slower desensitization kinetics (24Britt J.C. Brenner H.R. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In that case, the two distinct desensitization patterns are because of differences in subunit composition of the channels. We cannot exclude the possibility that somewhat analogous differences might be present in flow-activated Cl– channels in ECs. Another possibility for the differences in desensitization characteristics among BAECs is that desensitization does occur in all cells but that cell-to-cell differences exist in shear stress threshold required for its occurrence. Our results show that step increases in shear stress induce increased Cl– current only if the shear stress levels fall below those leading to maximal current (∼3.5 dynes/cm2). Above the saturation shear stress, the current is nonresponsive to step increases in shear stress and exhibits desensitization similar to that observed for sustained flow at a single shear stress level. If this behavior occurs in vivo, then sudden increases in shear stress associated with changes in stress and/or activity level would only be expected to elicit alterations in Cl– current if the shear stress excursions fall below the saturation levels defined in this study. Cessation of flow results in slow and progressive decrease of the Cl– current toward pre-flow base-line levels. Cells stimulated with flow during this recovery period are only minimally responsive to flow and only if the stimulation is at a higher shear stress than the initial stimulus. Flow stoppage and subsequent resumption occur during episodes of ischemia-reperfusion in vivo. The present results suggest that for short periods of flow interruption, reperfusion would be expected to elicit only minimal Cl– currents. On the other hand, if the flow cessation period were sufficiently long, then the Cl– channels would resensitize and recover their full responsiveness to flow. Arterial regions exposed to oscillatory flow are particularly prone to the development of atherosclerosis, whereas regions exposed to nonreversing pulsatile flow are largely protected (3Nerem R.M. J. Biomech. Eng. 1992; 114: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 4Ku D.N. Giddens D.P. Zarins C.K. Glagov S. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently reported that although flow-sensitive K+ channels are equally responsive to steady flow as they are to oscillatory flow with a physiological oscillation frequency of 1 Hz, Cl– channels respond to steady flow but are largely insensitive to 1-Hz oscillatory flow (12Lieu D.K. Pappone P.A. Barakat A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1367-C1375Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study, we have confirmed the nonresponsiveness of the Cl– current to 1-Hz oscillatory flow. Stimulating BAECs with oscillatory flow at subphysiological frequencies (0.04 or 0.2 Hz) leads to partial recovery of the Cl– current. This is not surprising because in the limit of very low frequencies, oscillatory flow approaches steady flow. Consistent with previous observations in coronary ECs using membrane potential sensitive fluorescent dyes (25Qiu W.P. Hu Q. Paolocci N. Ziegelstein R.C. Kass D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H341-H346Google Scholar), our results have also shown that 1-Hz nonreversing pulsatile flow has the same effect on the Cl– current as steady flow. Phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt plays an important role in regulating fundamental aspects of EC function, including endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activation, integrin signaling, and cell apoptosis (17Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar, 20Wiesner T.F. Berk B.C. Nerem R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3726-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previous studies have established that Akt phosphorylation is regulated by steady shear stress (15Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 16Go Y.M. Boo Y.C. Park H. Maland M.C. Patel R. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Darley-Usmar V. Jo H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1574-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The present results show that pharmacologically blocking flow-sensitive Cl– channels significantly attenuates shear stress-induced Akt phosphorylation. However, there is no significant change in Akt activation when flow-sensitive K+ channels are blocked. Furthermore, 1-Hz oscillatory flow, which correlates in vivo with the development of early atherosclerotic lesions and activates flow-sensitive K+ channels but fails to stimulate Cl– channels, elicits significantly smaller Akt phosphorylation than steady flow. These observations are consistent with the notion that shear stress-induced Akt phosphorylation occurs through mechanisms that are dependent on flow-sensitive Cl– channels but not K+ channels. If confirmed in vivo, these findings would suggest that activation of flow-sensitive Cl– channels might play an important protective role against atherosclerosis. This issue naturally merits future investigation. Our studies also indicate that the extent of Cl– current activation correlates with the level of applied shear stress and not the applied shear rate. This finding suggests that the impact of flow on Cl– channels is direct rather than through an effect on the convective and/or diffusive delivery or removal of specific fluid-borne agonists. Interestingly, the extent of mobilization of intracellular calcium in ECs has also been shown to be responsive to shear stress rather than shear rate (23Ando J. Ohtsuka A. Korenaga R. Kawamura T. Kamiya A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how shear stress may directly activate Cl– channels. As has been described elsewhere (8Barakat A.I. Lieu D.K. Gojova A. Biomaterials. 2006; 27: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Barakat A.I. J. Theor. Biol. 2001; 210: 221-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), if the extracellular domain of a Cl– channel is modeled as a sphere with a diameter of ∼10 nm that is adherent to a planar surface (the EC surface) and is subjected to Stokes flow at a physiological shear stress of 1–10 dynes/cm2, then the energy imparted to the channel is expected to be 2–3 orders of magnitude smaller than the thermal energy of the channel. Therefore, the fluid mechanical force would not be “felt” by the channel, which renders it unlikely that channel activation occurs as a result of a direct conformational change induced by the applied fluid mechanical force. Rather, a more likely pathway might be channel gating through an effect of flow on cell membrane tension, membrane subdomains to which the channels are directly coupled, or intracellular cytoskeletal elements and/or cytoskeleton-associated structures. The molecular identity of flow-sensitive Cl– channels remains to be determined. Previous studies have demonstrated that volume-regulated anion channels in BAECs are also responsive to shear stress and that these channels desensitize following repeated shear stimulation (27Romanenko V.G. Davies P.F. Levitan I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C708-C718Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); however, volume-regulated anion channels appear to require both hypotonic conditions and ATP for activation. The Cl– current in this study occurs under iso-osmotic conditions and in the absence of ATP in the patch pipette solution. Efforts aimed at cloning flow-activated Cl– channels would significantly enhance our understanding of the role of these channels in regulating EC function under both normal and pathological conditions.

It consists of two subunits; HIF-1α is rapidly degraded under normoxic condition by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, whereas HIF-1β is stable.

Oxygen molecules inhibit not only the stabilization of HIF-1α but also its transactivation activity, because the protein, factor-inhibiting HIF-1α (FIH-1), catalyzes hydroxylation of its asparagine residue using O2, α-ketoglutarate, vitamin C, and Fe(II). Hydroxylation of this asparagine residue in the transactivation domain of HIF-1α prevents it from recruiting its coactivator, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP) (3Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar, 9Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar).Thus, activation of HIF-1α is censored by two systems, proline hydroxylation and asparagine hydroxylation. HIF-1α and its targets, such as EPO and VEGF, are being evaluated as therapeutic agents for cerebral and myocardial infarctions, and a small lipophilic HIF-1α-activating compound is being sought as a treatment for these diseases. However, to generate fully functional HIF-1α, a putative HIF-1α activator should suppress both proline hydroxylation-dependent ubiquitination and asparagine hydroxylation.We showed previously that the zinc chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) enhances the activity of PHD2 but that the level of HIF-1α protein does not fall because TPEN also inhibits its ubiquitination. Because TPEN does not prevent FIH-1 from hydroxylating the asparagine residue of HIF-1α, it leads the accumulation of nonfunctional HIF-1α (10Choi S.M. Choi K.-O. Lee N. Oh M. Park H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Choi K.-O. Lee T. Lee N. Kim J. Yang E. Yoon J. Kim J. Lee T. Park H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we report that another zinc chelator, Clioquinol, which has relatively low affinity but high selectivity for Zn(II) and Cu(II), has a different effect on the activity of HIF-1α. Both TPEN and Clioquinol inhibit ubiquitination of HIF-1α and cause its accumulation. However, in contrast to TPEN, Clioquinol prevents FIH-1 from hydroxylating HIF-1α. It therefore stabilizes functional HIF-1α, leading to expression of its target genes in normoxic cells.Clioquinol has been used in Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases as a Cu(II)- and Zn(II) chelator that reverses Zn(II)- or Cu(II)-induced metalloprotein precipitation (12Raman B.

Resin-bound GST-ODD (200 μg of protein/∼80 μl of resin volume) was incubated in the presence of 2 mm ascorbic acid, 100 μm FeCl2, and 5 mm α-ketoglutarate with 1.5-3 μg of PHD2 in 200 μl of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with mild agitation for 90 min at 30 °C.

Resin-bound GST-ODD was mixed with 10 μl of 35S-labeled VHL in 500 μl of EBC buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). After mild agitation at 4 °C for 2 h, the resin was washed three times with 1 ml of NETN buffer, and proteins were eluted in 3× SDS sample buffer, fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. The amount of each sample loaded was monitored by staining the GST-ODD with Coomassie Blue.In Vitro Ubiquitination—HeLa cells were washed twice with cold hypotonic extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).

Hydroxylation of peptide was measured by mass spectrophotometric analysis. F-HIF-1α (amino acids 788–822) peptide (fluorescein isothiocyanate-aca-DESGLPQLTSYDCEVNAPIQGSRNLLQGEELLRAL) containing fluorescein conjugated with an N-terminal-inserted aminocaproic acid (aca) linker (AnyGen, KwangJu, Korea) developed for another assay 4H. Cho, H. Park, and E. G. Yang, unpublished results. was used for the FIH-1 reaction. The peptide was incubated at a final concentration of 4 μm with 2.8 μg of recombinant FIH-1 in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2 containing 100 μm α-ketoglutarate and 400 μm ascorbic acid in a total volume of 50 μl. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, excess salts were removed with ZipTipC18 (Millipore). The peptide was eluted from the tip with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (50:50, v/v) followed by extensive washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The eluted peptide solution was transferred to a MALDI sample plate and MALDI-TOF measurements were performed with a Voyager analyzer (Applied Biosystems).Co-immunoprecipitation—HepG2 cells were grown to 80% confluence on 100-mm tissue culture plates and treated with drugs as indicated for 6 h in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Whole cell extracts were prepared as previously described (6Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4367) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 200-μg samples of whole cell lysates were precleared by incubating with 1 μg of anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and 20 μl of 0.5% ImmunoPure immobilized protein A/G gel (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared extracts were mixed with 1 μg of anti-CBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After addition of 15 μl of 0.5% ImmunoPure immobilized protein A/G gel, they were rotated overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted, washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. They were then boiled for 5 min and run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry transfer (Trans-Blot S.D.; Bio-Rad). Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were reacted with anti-human HIF-1α antibody (BD Biosciences) and/or anti-CBP antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce) with anti-mouse or rabbit Ig conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as secondary antibody. Weak signals from protein bands on Western blots were visualized with a luminescence image analyzer (Model LAS-3000; Fuji).RESULTSClioquinol Stabilizes Functional HIF-1α Protein—Human hepatoma HepG2 cells and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to the cation chelators TPEN and Clioquinol in both normoxic and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions, and levels of HIF-1α protein were measured by Western blotting. Both TPEN and Clioquinol dramatically increased the amount of HIF-1α in normoxic cells (Fig. 1A). The data in Fig. 1B show that addition of Zn(II) and Cu(II) together reversed the effect of Clioquinol, indicating that it stabilizes HIF-1α by depleting Zn(II), and Cu(II) (19Cherny R.A. Legg J.T. McLean C.A. Fairlie D.P. Huang X. Atwood C.S. Beyreuther K. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. J. Biol.

Sci. 1986; 75: 190-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Addition of Fe(II) failed to reverse the effect of Clioquinol, indicating that Fe(II) is not involved in stabilization.To see whether this stabilization led to expression of HIF-1α target genes we measured the expression of VEGF by reverse transcriptase PCR. In the event, Clioquinol but not TPEN increased expression of VEGF in normoxic cells (Fig. 2A), whereas TPEN reduced the hypoxia-induced expression of VEGF in SH-SY5Y cells. Similarly, Clioquinol, but not TPEN, induced expression of luciferase under the control of hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE) in normoxic cells whereas TPEN decreased expression in hypoxic cells (Fig. 2B). Ultimately, the activated HIF-1α binds to the HRE located in the enhancer region and thus increases transcription of target genes such as VEGF and EPO. Thus, the two chelators both stabilized HIF-1α protein but differed in their effects on transactivation of HIF-1α.FIGURE 2Effect of TPEN and Clioquinol on expression of the HIF-1α target gene. A, HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cells were treated with TPEN (5 μm) and Clioquinol (indicated dose) in normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 16 h or for the indicated hours. 1-μg aliquots of isolated total RNA were used for reverse transcription. To amplify and visualize the cDNAs of VEGF mRNA or 18S RNA, two sets of primers were used: for VEGF (AF022375), forward primer (ccatgaactttctgctgtctt) and reverse primer (atcgcatcaggggcacacag); for 18S rRNA (X03205), forward primer (accgcagctaggaataatggaata) and reverse primer (ctttcgctctggtccgtctt). 30-cycle PCR products were run on 1% agarose gels. B, effect of TPEN and Clioquinol on HRE-dependent gene expression. 5 × 104 HepG2 cells were transfected with 100 ng of the HRE-driven reporter plasmid, p(HRE)4-luc, together with plasmid pCHO110 (50 ng), which encodes β-galactosidase. 16 h prior to harvest the cells were treated with TPEN and Clioquinol. 48 h after transfection, luciferase activities were analyzed using the reporter gene assay system (Promega) and normalized by β-galactosidase activities.

We examined the hydroxylation activity of PHD2 by measuring capture of 35S-labeled VHL by the ODD domain (amino acids 401-603) of human HIF-1α protein, because the interaction of VHL with HIF-1α depends on hydroxylation of the proline-402/564 residues. Human PHD2 was expressed with a histidine tag in E. coli and purified as described previously (11Choi K.-O. Lee T. Lee N. Kim J. Yang E. Yoon J. Kim J. Lee T. Park H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We treated the purified full-length PHD2 with either Clioquinol or TPEN and measured its activity by VHL pulldown assays. TPEN increased the activity of PHD2 (10Choi S.M. Choi K.-O. Lee N. Oh M. Park H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas Clioquinol did not. This result demonstrates that the two zinc chelators differ in their effect on the activity of PHD2 (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Effect of Clioquinol on the activity of PHD2 and ubiquitination of HIF-1α. A, effect of Clioquinol on the activity of PHD2. Histidine-tagged full-length PHD2 (amino acids 1–426) was expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel-affinity and gel filtration chromatography (11Choi K.-O. Lee T. Lee N. Kim J. Yang E. Yoon J. Kim J. Lee T. Park H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The PHD2 (1.5 μg) was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of Clioquinol or TPEN for 10 min at room temperature, added to resin-bound GST-ODD (amino acids 401–603 of human HIF-1α), and incubated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The captured 35S-labeled VHL was visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The amount of each sample loaded was monitored by measuring GST-ODD stained with Coomassie Blue. One representative of at least three independent experiments with similar results is shown. B, effect of Clioquinol on the in vitro ubiquitination of HIF-1α. In vitro ubiquitination assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and ubiquitinated HIF-1α was visualized by 6% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The position of non-ubiquitinated HIF-1α is indicated. A representative of at least three independent experiments with similar results is shown. C, effect of Clioquinol on in vivo ubiquitination of HIF-1α. HepG2 cells were exposed to TPEN (5 μm), MG132 (5 μm), or Clioquinol (100 μm) for 6 h in normoxic conditions. HIF-1α was detected by Western blotting. High molecular mass ubiquitinated HIF-1α and non-ubiquitinated HIF-1α are indicated. One representative of at least three independent experiments with similar results is shown (8% SDS-PAGE, whole cell lysate 30 μg).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also looked for any change in the ubiquitination of HIF-1α in the presence of Clioquinol. We synthesized 35S-labeled HIF-1α and subjected it to in vitro ubiquitination in the presence of ubiquitin, ubiquitin aldehyde, and the S-10 fraction of cells. The ladder-like appearance of high molecular weight HIF-1α in Fig. 3B confirms that the 35S-labeled HIF-1α was ubiquitinated in vitro. Interestingly, Clioquinol repressed this ubiquitination.Anti-HIF-1α antibody recognizes high molecular mass HIF-1α protein in cell lysates exposed to the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which specifically inhibits the 26S proteasome, thereby reducing the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated HIF-1α even in normoxic conditions. We detected much less high molecular mass HIF-1α in cells exposed to either Clioquinol or TPEN (Fig. 3C). This observation shows that Clioquinol blocks the ubiquitination of HIF-1α, thereby causing it to accumulate in normoxic cells in agreement with the results of the in vitro ubiquitination assay.Effect of Clioquinol on the Activity of FIH-1—Transactivation of HIF-1α is inhibited by hydroxylation of its asparagine 803 residue catalyzed by an asparagine hydroxylase named FIH-1 (9Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 21Dann III, C.E. Bruick R.K. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). The fact that the HIF-1α accumulated in the presence of Clioquinol is able to induce expression of its target genes implies that Clioquinol inhibits this hydroxylation. Because Asn-803 hydroxylation inhibits the interaction of HIF-1α with its coactivator, CBP, HIF-1α is activated when FIH-1 activity decreases (23Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled HIF-1α was incubated with purified recombinant FIH-1 (10Choi S.M. Choi K.-O. Lee N. Oh M. Park H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Untreated 35S-labeled HIF-1α interacted with bead-bound GST-CBP protein, whereas FIH-1-treated HIF-1α failed to do so (Fig. 4A, lane 1 versus 4 and Fig. 4B, lane 1 versus 4). Because FIH-1 hydroxylates the asparagine 803 residue of HIF-1α, reducing recruitment of CBP to the transactivation domain of HIF-1α, the activity of FIH-1 is inversely related to the interaction between HIF-1α and CBP. We first tested the effect of Clioquinol on FIH-1 activity. In the presence of Clioquinol (Fig. 4A, 10 and 50 μm, lanes 5 and 6; Fig. 4B, 50 μm, lane 5; Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 4), the activity of FIH-1 was reduced so that the interaction between HIF-1α and CBP increased, whereas TPEN failed to reduce FIH-1 activity (Fig. 4B, lane 4 versus 6) (10Choi S.M. Choi K.-O. Lee N. Oh M. Park H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The difference between Clioquinol and TPEN reflects the fact that Clioquinol, but not TPEN, activates the expression of HIF-1α target genes (Fig. 2A). Although the zinc finger motif CH1 domain is located in the HIF-1α-interacting region of CBP, neither Clioquinol nor TPEN directly affects the interaction between CBP and HIF-1α (Fig. 4, A–D, lanes 1 and 2). Our results therefore suggest that the HIF-1α accumulated in the presence of Clioquinol is able to recruit its coactivator because its proline, but not its asparagine, residues are hydroxylated. TPEN fails to inhibit the activity of FIH-1, thus generating nonfunctional HIF-1α.FIGURE 4Effect of Clioquinol on the activity of FIH-1. FIH-1 was expressed and purified as described previously (10Choi S.M. Choi K.-O. Lee N. Oh M. Park H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 35S-labeled HIF-1α was hydroxylated for 1 h at 30°C with 1.5 μg of purified FIH-1 protein in the presence or absence of 10 and 50 μm Clioquinol (A) or 10 μm TPEN (B), with or without Zn(II) (50 and 100 μm) (C), or Cu(II) (50 and 100 μm) (D). Resin-bound GST-CBP-N (amino acids 1–450 of CBP) (18Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) was then added to each mixture, incubation continued for 1 h at 4°C, and the HIF-1α captured by CBP visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Sample loading was monitored by measuring GST-CBP-N (CH1) stained with Coomassie Blue. E, the asparagine-specific effect of Clioquinol. 35S-labeled HIF-1α-C(N803A) (amino acids 400–826, asparagine-803 is substituted with alanine) and 35S-labeled HIF-1α-C(N803A) were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation and hydroxylated with FIH-1 in the presence of Clioquinol. Resin-bound GST-CBP-N (CBP amino acids 1–450) was added to each mixture. HIF-1α-C(N803A) captured by CBP were visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Sample loading was monitored by measuring GST-CBP-N (CH1) stained with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether the inhibitory effect of Clioquinol on FIH-1 depends on Zn(II) or Cu(II), we added these cations to the FIH-1 hydroxylation reaction together with Clioquinol. Both Cu(II) and Zn(II) failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of Clioquinol, indicating that Clioquinol inhibits the asparagine hydroxylation activity of FIH-1 in a Cu(II)- and Zn(II)-independent manner (Fig. 4, C and D). This result is consistent with the finding that the other Cu(II) and Zn(II) chelator, TPEN, fails to inhibit the activity of FIH-1.We tested the effect of Clioquinol on HIF-1α mutated at Asn-803 to see whether its effect is specific for asparagine 803 hydroxylation of HIF-1α. The HIF-1α-C(N803A) mutant, in which asparagine 803 is substituted with alanine, retains its ability to interact with GST-CBP. When FIH-1 was incubated with radiolabeled HIF-1α-C(N803A) it failed to prevent HIF-1α-C(N803A) from recruiting CBP, and Clioquinol did not enhance the recruitment of CBP to HIF-1α-C(N803A) regardless of the presence of FIH-1 (Fig. 4E). This finding suggests that Clioquinol stimulates the recruitment of C"

https://openalex.org/W1996462501,"Postreplication repair facilitates tolerance of DNA damage during replication, overcoming termination of replication at sites of DNA damage. A major post-replication repair pathway in mammalian cells is translesion synthesis, which is carried out by specialized polymerase(s), such as polymerase η, and is identified by focus formation by the polymerase after irradiation with UVC light. The formation of these foci depends on RAD18, which ubiquitinates PCNA for the exchange of polymerases. To understand the initial processes in translesion synthesis, we have here analyzed the response to damage of RAD18 in human cells. We find that human RAD18 accumulates very rapidly and remains for a long period of time at sites of different types of DNA damage, including UVC light-induced lesions, and x-ray microbeam- and laser-induced single-strand breaks, in a cell cycle-independent manner. The accumulation of RAD18 at DNA damage is observed even when DNA replication is inhibited, and a small region containing a zinc finger motif located in the middle of RAD18 is essential and sufficient for the replication-independent damage accumulation. The zinc finger motif of RAD18 is not necessary for UV-induced polymerase η focus formation, but another SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus and PIAS) motif near the zinc finger is required. These data indicate that RAD18 responds to DNA damage in two distinct ways, one replication-dependent and one replication-independent, involving the SAP and zinc finger motifs, respectively.

DNA in living cells is highly vulnerable to endogenous and environmental-damaging agents. If not accurately repaired, DNA damage may cause mutation and cell death, and can eventually lead to cancer and aging (1Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3162) Google Scholar). In human cells the majority of DNA damage appears to be repaired by excision repair pathways (2Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). However, considerable amounts of damage are thought to escape repair because of the limited repair capacity of cells. During DNA replication, unrepaired DNA damage may inhibit the progression of replication forks, and this inhibition may result in gaps in the newly synthesized strand and may be converted to more severe secondary damage, such as DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) 2The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; nt, nucleotide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; ssDNA, single-strand DNA; Gy, Gray; PRR, postreplication repair mechanisms; SSB, single-stranded break; NER, nucleotide excision repair; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.

Recently, it has become clear that cells, from bacteria to human, possess highly significant postreplication repair mechanisms (PRR) to overcome such replication blockages (4Friedberg E.C.

Res. 2002; 509: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a number of genes belonging to the RAD6 epistasis group are responsible for the PRR pathway (6Lawrence C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). RAD6 and RAD18 are two of the most important genes involved in the PRR pathway and mutation of either gene results in hypersensitivity to UV light and loss of UV-induced mutagenesis, indicating that Rad6 and Rad18 are involved in error-free as well as error-prone modes of PRR (7Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Rad6 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and the functions of Rad6 in yeast depend on its ability to transfer ubiquitin molecules to substrate proteins (8Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2695-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Mol.

Although Rad6 interacts with several ubiquitin-ligating enzymes (E3), the interaction with Rad18 is essential for carrying out PRR (10Wood A. Schneider J. Dover J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol.

The N-terminal region of Rad18 contains a RING finger motif, which confers ubiquitin ligase activity (14Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The middle part of Rad18 contains a C2HC type zinc finger motif and a SAP domain, which are thought to mediate protein-protein interaction or DNA binding (15Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 16Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of Rad18 is required for its interaction with Rad6 (17Bailly V. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4536-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The yeast Rad18 has single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding activity, and the majority of cellular Rad18 forms a highly stable binary complex with Rad6 (11Bailly V. Lamb J. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 18Bailly V. Lauder S. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23360-23365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because Rad6 does not have any DNA binding activity and interacts tightly with Rad18, it has been proposed that Rad18 recruits Rad6 to the site of DNA damage via its physical interaction, where Rad6 modulates the function of stalled DNA replication machinery with its ubiquitin-conjugating activity (11Bailly V. Lamb J. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Supporting this hypothesis, it has been reported that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a DNA polymerase sliding clamp involved in DNA synthesis and repair, is ubiquitinated in a Rad6- and Rad18-dependent manner and the monoubiquitination of PCNA is necessary for carrying out translesion synthesis by polymerase η (Polη) in yeast cells (19Haracska L. Torres-Ramos C.A. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S.

However, how Rad18 is targeted to the stalled replication forks remains to be understood. The genes responsible for PRR are highly conserved throughout evolution. In mammals, the Rad6 homolog is encoded by two closely related genes, HHR6A and HHR6B, each of which complement the defects in DNA repair and UVC light mutagenesis of the yeast rad6 mutant (22Koken M.H. Reynolds P. Jaspers-Dekker I. Prakash L. Prakash S. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8865-8869Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Neither mHR6A nor mHR6B knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts show increased UVC light sensitivity in contrast to the severe UVC light sensitivity of the Rad6-deficient yeast cells, indicating a functional redundancy between the two proteins in DNA repair (23Roest H.P.

Human RAD18 protein can interact with both HHR6A and HHR6B, and either overexpression of a dominant negative RAD18 mutant protein in human cells or targeted disruption of the Rad18 gene in mouse embryonic stem cells results in increased UVC light sensitivity, suggesting that mammalian RAD18 is involved in PRR (25Tateishi S.

Recently, it was shown that human PCNA is also monoubiquitinated in a RAD18-dependent manner at stalled replication forks by UV light lesions, and this might cause a polymerase switch from replicative polymerase to the translesion polymerase, Polη (28Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 29Watanabe K. Tateishi S. Kawasuji M. Tsurimoto T. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3886-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the mode of PRR is conserved from yeast to mammals. To understand the step required before monoubiquitination, in other words, how human RAD18 is recruited to the site of damage, we analyzed damage-dependent translocation of RAD18 in human cells. Here, we show that human RAD18 accumulates at the site of UVC light-induced DNA damage and UVA laser-induced DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) independently of DNA replication and dependent on the zinc finger motif of RAD18. This zinc finger motif is dispensable for Polη focus formation. However, we found that deletion of the SAP domain located near the zinc finger motif of RAD18 abrogates its complementation ability for UV-induced Polη focus formation in RAD18-deficient cells, suggesting that RAD18 may assemble at the site of stalled replication forks via its SAP motif. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—HeLa cells were used unless otherwise indicated. The nucleotide excision repair (NER)-deficient cell line was XP12ROSV, an SV40-transformed XP-A cell line derived from an XP-A patient. The RAD18-knock-out cell line established from human HCT116 cell lines will be reported elsewhere. 3M. Mori and T. Shiomi, manuscript in preparation. Cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Synchronization of cells was performed by the double thymidine block method. Briefly, 5 × 104 cells were seeded into 3.5-cm dishes and grown for 2 days. Thymidine was then added to 2.5 mm final concentration, and cells were further incubated for 22-24 h. Thymidine-containing medium was removed and cells were washed three times with Hank's buffer and fresh medium was added. After 10 h of incubation, hydroxyurea (HU) was added to 1 mm final concentration, and cells were incubated for 14-16 h. Under these conditions, cells accumulate at the G1/S border. HU-containing medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with Hank's buffer, and the cells were incubated for 0, 3, 8, and 16 h in fresh medium to obtain G1/S, S-phase, G2-M, G1-phase cells, respectively. Synchronization of the cell cycle was confirmed by FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) and immunostaining for the incorporation of BrdU. Plasmids—The human RAD18 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from a HeLa cell cDNA library using PCR primers with a XhoI site at the 5′ terminus and a NotI site at the 3′ terminus and cloned into pT7Blue (Novagen). The sequence of the cloned gene was confirmed by sequencing. GFP-tagged RAD18 was generated by an in-frame ligation of a RAD18 fragment (4-1485 nt) encoding the entire RAD18 sequence, except for the start and termination codons, into either pEGFP-C1 or N1 or pDsRed-Monomer-C1 (Clontech). To generate FLAG-tagged RAD18 protein, the same fragment was introduced into a pCY4B-N-FLAG mammalian expression vector harboring a chicken β-globin promoter and an N terminus FLAG tag. To generate GFP-tagged RAD18 deletion proteins, pEGFP-C1-RAD18 was digested with restriction enzymes and appropriately ligated to produce in-frame fusions. To delete the N terminus of the RAD18 protein, a RAD18 fragment (580-1485 nt) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pEGFP-C1. To generate pEGFP-RAD18 1-449CF, pEGFP-RAD18 was amplified by PCR with the following primers: 5′-TGTCCTGTTTTGGGGGTTAACATT-3′ and 5′-ATCCACTTTAGTAACTTGTTTCAA-3′. To generate pEGFP-RAD18 Δ248-284, the 5′ fragment of RAD18 cDNA was obtained by PCR with the following primers: 5′-CTCGAGGACTCCCTGGCCGAGTCTCGGTGGCCT-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTACAGTTTTGGGCAGCGGCTTCCTTTT-3′ and the 3′ fragment of RAD18 cDNA was obtained by PCR with the following primers: 5′-GAATTCCACATGTACAATGCCCAATGCGATGCT-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCAATTCCTATTACGCTTGTTTCTTGGTTC-3′. These fragments were cloned into pT7Blue and digested with XhoI and EcoRI or EcoRI and NotI, respectively. These fragments were introduced into pBluescript II and digested with XhoI and NotI, then inserted into the XhoI - NotI sites of pEGFP-C1. All the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Local UVC Light Irradiation—Local UVC light irradiation was performed as previously described (30Okano S. Lan L. Caldecott K.W. Mori T. Yasui A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3974-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells per 3.5-cm glass bottom dish (poly-l-lysine-coated; MATSUNAMI) and cultured for 2 days. Cells were then washed twice with Hank's buffer and covered with a polycarbonate isopore membrane filter with pores of 3 μm in diameter (Millipore) and irradiated with 10-100 J/m2 UVC light. After irradiation, cells were incubated in growth medium for the time indicated. Micro X-ray Beam Irradiation—We used a synchrotron radiation light source installed in the Photon Factory, Institute of Materials Structure Science, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Tsukuba, Japan. Cells were irradiated with an x-ray microbeam, which was focused with a metal slit system onto a 3-5 μm square. The intensity of X-rays obtained with the slit system is about 40 R/s. Experimental details will be published elsewhere (31Kobayashi K. Usami N. Maezawa T. Hayahi K. Hieda K. Takakura K. J. Biomed. Nanotechnol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Antibodies—The rabbit antibody to human RAD18 has been described previously (25Tateishi S. Sakuraba Y. Masuyama S. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody (Anti-FLAG M2; Sigma) was used for observation of FLAG-tagged protein. A mouse monoclonal antibody (Anti-BrdU; Roche) was used for detection of DNA synthesis. The antibody for detection of UVC light-induced DNA damage was TDM2, which is specific for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) (32Mori T. Nakane M. Hattori T. Matsunaga T. Ihara M. Nikaido O. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). XRCC1 Ab-1 (33-2-5) (Neo Markers) and PCNA (Ab-1) (Oncogene) were used. Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse, and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescence—Cell were washed twice with PBS, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. Cells were washed once for 5 min with TNT buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min and washed three times for 5 min with TNT buffer. Cells were incubated in TNB buffer (TNT buffer containing blocking reagent, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in TNB buffer and incubated for 1 h. After each antibody binding step, cells were washed three times for 5 min with TNT buffer. DNA was stained with 4′,6′ diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). When staining for CPD, DNA was denatured by incubation in 2.5 n HCl for 5 min at 37 °C after Triton X-100 treatment and cells were washed twice for 5 min with PBS and then incubated in TNB buffer. For observation of GFP-tagged RAD18 and CPD, cells were washed twice with PBS, then fixed with methanol-acetone for 10 min at -20 °C. Cells were washed for 5 min with TNT buffer and incubated in TNB buffer after fixation without HCl treatment. To monitor DNA synthesis, cells were incubated in 10 μm BrdU for 30 min before fixation. After fixation, cells were treated with 2.5 n HCl at 37 °C for 1 h, then washed three times for 5 min with PBS, once for 5 min with TNT buffer and incubated in TNB buffer. Incubation was performed at room temperature except for denaturing of DNA. Microscopy and Laser Microirradiation—Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA by FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science) and cultured for 2 days. Before UVA laser irradiation, the growth medium was changed to OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen), and cells were placed into a humidity chamber on the microscope stage (OLYMPUS) to keep the temperature at 37 °C. Confocal fluorescence images were captured using a FV500 laser-scanning microcope (OLYMPUS). We used UVA laser irradiation either passed through a F20 filter, which penetrates 0.75 μJ light per single pulse and produces mainly SSB for observation of accumulation of GFP-RAD18 or through a F25 filter, which penetrates 2.5 μJ light per single pulse and produces SSB as well as DSB for observation of accumulation of endogenous RAD18. Further details of UVA laser microirradiation have been described previously (33Lan L. Nakajima S. Oohata Y. Takao M. Okano S. Masutani M. Wilson S.H. Yasui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13738-13743Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Accumulation of Human RAD18 at UVC Light-irradiated Sites—To investigate the response of RAD18 to DNA damage, we exposed cells to local irradiation using two different sources of light, local UVC light and a UVA laser, which produce cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PP), or SSB, DSB, and oxidative base lesions, respectively (30Okano S. Lan L. Caldecott K.W. Mori T. Yasui A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3974-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 33Lan L. Nakajima S. Oohata Y. Takao M. Okano S. Masutani M. Wilson S.H.

Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). We first examined the response of RAD18 to UVC light in HeLa cells by local UVC light irradiation. Cells on a dish were covered with a polycarbonate filter with micropores of 3-μm diameter prior to UVC light irradiation. Because the filter blocks UVC light with wavelengths shorter than 300 nm, UVC light can pass only through the pores and produce DNA lesions at several discrete spots in the nuclei of the irradiated cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, CPD, one of the major UVC light-induced DNA lesions, was detected in localized spots after UVC light irradiation of 100 J/m2 through filter pores. Because CPD are repaired only slowly by NER even in wild-type human cells (36Mitchell D.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), the intensity of the spots for CPD decreased only slightly even 8 h after irradiation (upper panel in Fig. 1A). Before UVC light irradiation, endogenous RAD18 molecules were detected by RAD18 antibody in the nucleus as small dots (No UVC in Fig. 1A). After 15 min of postirradiation incubation, RAD18 had already accumulated at the irradiated sites, and co-localized with the CPD spots as shown in the merged images in the panel. RAD18 was observed co-localized with CPD until 8 h after local UVC light irradiation with 100 J/m2. After local UVC light irradiation with the much lower dose of 10 J/m2, spots of RAD18 were detected as well (Fig. 1B). To determine the effect of NER, we investigated the accumulation of RAD18 in NER-deficient XP-A cells. As shown in Fig. 1 C, RAD18 accumulated at the sites of DNA damage and co-localized with CPD in the absence of XPA. Because similar results were obtained in XP-C mutant cells (not shown), we concluded that RAD18 accumulates at UVC-irradiated regions independently of NER. Human RAD18 Accumulates at SSB Sites Produced by UVA Laser and X-ray Microbeams—Because RAD18-deficient embryonic stem cells are sensitive to various DNA-damaging agents besides UVC light irradiation (27Tateishi S. Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Fujimoto S. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), RAD18 protein may respond to DNA damage other than UVC light-induced lesions. We recently established an experimental system to characterize real time responses of repair proteins to various types of oxidative DNA damage (33Lan L. Nakajima S. Oohata Y. Takao M. Okano S. Masutani M. Wilson S.H. Yasui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13738-13743Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This experimental system consists of a confocal laser scanning microscope and 365 nm UVA laser light irradiation equipment and can create several types of DNA damage in a restricted area of the nucleus in a laser dose-dependent manner. We have shown that after irradiation of cells with laser light passed through a F20 filter DNA lesions other than SSB were hardly detected. The laser light dose used in this study does not produce detectable UVC light-induced lesions; neither CPD nor 6-4PP, were detected by antibodies against the lesions and neither of the photolyases for CPD or 6-4PP accumulates at the irradiated sites (not shown). Fig. 2A shows that endogenous RAD18 protein is detected at irradiated sites and colocalized with XRCC1 (upper panel) and PCNA (lower panel), respectively, 30 min after irradiation with 365-nm UVA laser light of passed throughout a F25 filter. Thus, RAD18 accumulates at sites of laser-induced DNA damage. We transiently expressed GFP-tagged RAD18 in HeLa cells and examined the kinetics of the accumulation of RAD18 at sites of damage. GFP-tagged RAD18 accumulated at irradiated sites after irradiation with a low laser dose, at which GFP-tagged XRCC1 but not other proteins such as DNA glycosylases for base damage or NBS1 for DSB accumulate (33Lan L. Nakajima S. Oohata Y. Takao M. Okano S. Masutani M. Wilson S.H. Yasui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13738-13743Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), indicating that RAD18 accumulates at SSB induced by UVA laser light (Fig. 2B). Accumulation of RAD18 was detected around 2 min after irradiation and the intensity of GFP fluorescence at the irradiated site increased gradually, reaching plateau at around 10 min (Fig. 2C) and not decreasing significantly until at least 1 h after irradiation (not shown). We have previously shown that accumulation of XRCC1 is dependent on the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase at SSB and the accumulation of XRCC1 is significantly affected by prior treatment of cells with 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline (DIQ), a potent inhibitor of PARP activation (30Okano S. Lan L. Caldecott K.W. Mori T. Yasui A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3974-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 33Lan L. Nakajima S. Oohata Y. Takao M. Okano S. Masutani M. Wilson S.H. Yasui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13738-13743Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast to XRCC1, DIQ treatment did not affect the accumulation of GFP-RAD18 at all and accumulation of RAD18 was not influenced by the absence of XRCC1 in the Chinese hamster XRCC1 mutant cell line, EM9 (not shown), indicating that accumulation of RAD18 at SSB is not influenced by XRCC1-dependent SSB repair pathways. To investigate whether RAD18 accumulates at SSB induced by agents other than UVA laser light, we irradiated cells with a microbeam of x-rays over a restricted area of the cell nuclei (31Kobayashi K. Usami N. Maezawa T. Hayahi K. Hieda K. Takakura K. J. Biomed. Nanotechnol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). As with UVA laser irradiation, GFP-tagged RAD18 accumulated at irradiated areas after irradiation with a dose at which we detected the accumulation of GFP-tagged XRCC1 but not RAD52 (Fig. 2D and not shown). The data correlate with the results obtained by UVA laser irradiation and confirm that RAD18 accumulates at SSB produced by x-rays. Accumulation of Human RAD18 at Sites of DNA Damage Is Independent of DNA Replication—Because RAD18 plays a pivotal role in PRR, it is believed that the function of RAD18 is associated with DNA replication (11Bailly V. Lamb J. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We, therefore, asked whether the accumulation of human RAD18 at the site of DNA damage depends on DNA replication. Cells were synchronized at the G1/S border by the double thymidine block method and released by removing HU-containing medium. Cells from different cell cycle phases were irradiated with UVC light through a porous filter or with a UVA laser. Although accumulation of RAD18 is most efficient in S-phase cells, RAD18 also accumulated in G1/S-arrested and G1-phase cells and remained at UVC light-irradiated sites for a long period (Fig. 3A and not shown). Whereas the frequency of RAD18 foci, which co-localized with CPD, decreased slightly in G2-M phase, accumulation of RAD18 was observed in all cell cycle phases. To confirm that the accumulation of RAD18 at the site of DNA damage does not depend on DNA replication, we visualized DNA replication by immunostaining for incorporated BrdU. In the presence of HU, DNA replication was inhibited and nuclei were not stained by the anti-BrdU antibody. After removal of HU, DNA replication initiated and more than 80% of cell nuclei were stained with anti-BrdU antibody at high levels (Fig. 3B). Although these nuclei were stained with anti-BrdU antibody at only back ground levels, accumulation of RAD18 was observed at the site of damage induced by local UVC irradiation (Fig. 3C), indicating that accumulation of RAD18 occurs even in cells not in S phase. As in the case of UVC light irradiation, GFP-tagged RAD18 also accumulated at sites of UVA laser irradiation in all cell cycle phases (not shown). The kinetics and intensity of accumulation of RAD18 were the same in cells at different phases of the cell cycle (not shown). These results indicate that the accumulation of RAD18 at the site of UVC light lesions and SSB is independent of DNA replication. Identification of the Minimal Domain of RAD18 Required for Accumulation—To identify the region of RAD18 required for the accumulation at the sites of DNA damage, we transiently expressed a series of RAD18 deletions fused with GFP at their N terminus in HeLa cells (Fig. 4A"
https://openalex.org/W2046002448,"RGS3 and RGS4 are GTPase-activating proteins expressed in the brain and heart that accelerate the termination of Gi/o- and Gq-mediated signaling. We report here the determinants mediating selective association of RGS4 with several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that form macromolecular complexes with neuronal G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir3 or GIRK) channels. Kir3 channels are instrumental in regulating neuronal firing in the central and peripheral nervous system and pacemaker activity in the heart. By using an epitope-tagged degradation-resistant RGS4 mutant, RGS4(C2V), immunoprecipitation of several hemagglutinin-tagged Gi/o-coupled and Gq-coupled receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells readily co-precipitated both Kir3.1/Kir3.2a channels and RGS4(C2V). In contrast to RGS4(C2V), the closely related and functionally active RGS3 “short” isoform (RGS3s) did not interact with any of the GPCR-Kir3 channel complexes examined. Deletion and chimeric RGS constructs indicate both the N-terminal domain and the RGS domain of RGS4(C2V) are necessary for association with m2 receptor-Kir3.1/Kir3.2a channel complexes, where the GPCR was found to be the major target for RGS4(C2V) interaction. The functional impact of RGS4(C2V) “precoupling” to the GPCR-Kir3 channel complex versus RGS3s “collision coupling” was a 100-fold greater potency in the acceleration of G protein-dependent Kir3 channel-gating kinetics with no attenuation in current amplitude. These findings demonstrate that RGS4, a highly regulated modulator and susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, can directly associate with multiple GPCR-Kir3 channel complexes and may affect a wide range of neurotransmitter-mediated inhibitory and excitatory events in the nervous and cardiovascular systems.

These findings, together with the potential role of RGS4 in regulating several neurotransmitter systems known to affect the symptoms of schizophrenia (hallucinations, delusions, and depression), have implicated RGS4 in the etiology of this disorder (13Harrison P.J. Weinberger D.R. Mol. Psychiatry. 2005; 10: 40-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Decreased RGS4 levels are also reported to correlate with the reduced cholinergic signaling found in Alzheimer disease (14Muma N.A. Mariyappa R. Williams K. Lee J.M.

At the post-translational level, RGS4 protein is rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-dependent N-end rule pathway, a process initiated by arginylation of Cys-2 by arginyltransferases and tightly coupled to the oxidative environment (24Davydov I.V.

Together these findings illustrate multiple levels of regulation that ultimately determine the RGS4 protein concentration affecting Gi/o and Gq/11 signaling in the brain and cardiovascular system. One of the key effectors for Gi/o- and Gq/11-coupled receptors that modulate neuronal excitability and cardiac pacemaker activity is the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir3/GIRK) channel (27Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-760PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stanfield P.R. Nakajima S. Nakajima Y. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

In contrast to activation by PTX-sensitive Gi/o-coupled receptors, Kir3 channels are inhibited by PTX-insensitive Gq/11-coupled receptor signaling causing enhanced neuronal excitability (33Nakajima Y.

Because RGS4 dramatically accelerates both the activation and deactivation time course for Gi/o-coupled receptor-activated Kir3 channel currents in reconstituted cell expression systems without compromising current amplitude (41Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 42Jaen C. Doupnik C.A. Neuropharmacology. 2005; 49: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we questioned whether RGS4 directly associates with GPCR-Kir3 channel complexes as a means of efficacious modulation and targeting specificity (43Zhang Q. Pacheco M.A. Doupnik C.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 545: 355-373Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We show here that RGS4 indeed can associate with several GPCR-Kir3 channel complexes comprised of either Gi/o- or Gq/11-coupled receptors expressed in CHO-K1 cells. RGS4 association is mediated primarily through interactions with the GPCR and not the Kir3 channel and displays specificity because a closely related RGS homolog (RGS3s) (42Jaen C. Doupnik C.A. Neuropharmacology. 2005; 49: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 44Reif K. Cyster J.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4720-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) does not interact with any of the GPCR-Kir3 channel complexes tested. Our findings demonstrate that RGS4 “precoupling” versus RGS3s “collision coupling” represents two distinct modes of GPCR-Kir3 channel modulation. N-terminal Tagged GPCRs—Complementary DNAs encoding the human muscarinic m2 receptor (GenBank™ accession number NM_000739), human serotonin 1A receptor (GenBank™ accession number NM_000524), and mouse lysophosphatidic acid (LPA1/edg2) receptor (GenBank™ accession number NM_010336) were “tagged” at their N termini with the HA sequence (YPYDVPDYA). The HA tag was preceded by a modified influenza hemagglutinin signal sequence (MKTIIALSYIFCLVFA) for efficient membrane targeting (45Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signal sequence and HA tag sequence were introduced by annealing two complementary oligonucleotide primers (Sigma-Genosys) that contained a 5′ HindIII restriction site followed by a Kozak translation initiation sequence (GCCGCCACC), the 16-amino acid signal sequence, the 9-amino acid HA sequence, and finally a 3′ XbaI restriction site. The annealed duplex was then cut with HindIII and XbaI and cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The complete coding region of the human muscarinic m2 receptor, human serotonin 1A receptor, and mouse LPA1 receptor were then amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame at the XbaI site of the N-terminal HA tag pcDNA3.1(+) vector. The cloning process resulted in two additional amino acids (SR) between the HA tag and starting methionine of the native GPCR sequence because of the XbaI sequence. The human adenosine A1 receptor (GenBank™ accession number AY136746), human dopamine D2L receptor (GenBank™ accession number NM_000795), and human muscarinic m1 receptor (GenBank™ accession number AF498915) were obtained from the University of Missouri, Rolla cDNA Resource Center, and contained N-terminal triple (3×) HA tags, and were also cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. C-terminal Tagged Kir3 Channels—The rat Kir3.1 channel subunit (GenBank™ accession number NM_031610) was tagged at the C terminus with the MYC epitope (EQKLISEEDL) by PCR and cloned into the pBudCE4.1 vector (Invitrogen). The pBudCE4.1 vector is a duel expression vector where Kir3.1-MYC expression was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Mouse Kir3.2a (GenBank™ accession number NM_010606) was cloned into the second cloning site with expression driven by the EF-1a promoter. The Kir3.2a subunit was not modified by epitope tagging. The resulting Kir3.1-MYC/Kir3.2a-pBudCE4.1 vector yielded expression of both Kir3 channel subunits from a single DNA plasmid. C-terminal Tagged RGS Proteins—Rat RGS4 (GenBank™ accession number NM_017214) and mouse RGS3s (GenBank™ accession number NM_134257) were tagged at their C termini with the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) by PCR using primers that incorporated the FLAG sequence. The RGS-FLAG constructs were cloned into the pBudCE4.1 vector with expression driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Enhanced green fluorescent protein, GFP(S65T) (pGreenlantern-1; Invitrogen), was cloned into the second site with expression driven by the EF-1a promoter. The resulting RGS-FLAG/GFP-pBudCE4.1 plasmids provided expression of the RGS-FLAG protein and the GFP reporter protein from a single DNA plasmid. A pBudCE4.1 plasmid containing only GFP(S65T) was also generated for negative control (RGS-) experiments. All point mutations, deletion mutations, and chimeras of RGS3s-FLAG and RGS4-FLAG were constructed by PCR and also cloned into the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven site of the GFP-pBudCE4.1 vector. The sequences of all epitope-tagged full-length cDNA constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Molecular Biology Core Facility, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL). CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in α-modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For electrophysiological experiments, cells were plated at low density on 35-mm culture dishes. For biochemical experiments, cells were plated at a similar density on 100-mm culture dishes. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and a mixture of 3-4 expression vectors. The total DNA (μg) to Lipofectamine (μg) ratio was kept constant at 1:5 when pre-forming the DNA-liposome complexes. The amount of each DNA vector in the mixture for each 35-mm dish was as follows: HA-GPCR-pcDNA3.1 (0.2 μg), Kir3.1-MYC/Kir3.2a-pBudCE4.1 (0.2 μg), and either RGS-FLAG/GFP-pBudCE4.1 or GFP-pBudCE4.1 (negative control) (1.0 μg). For transfection of cells plated in 100-mm dishes, the amounts were scaled eight times. Transfected CHO-K1 cells were incubated 24-36 h in serum-free Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen). For some experiments, mammalian expression vectors containing different Gα subunit cDNAs (Gαi2(C352G), GαoA(C351G), or Gαq) were included (1.6 μg for 100-mm dish). Transfected CHO-K1 cells (100-mm dishes) were first washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.2). Three 100-mm plates were combined for each experimental condition. Cells were lysed and collected by cell scraping in 800 μl of extraction buffer at 4 °C. The extraction buffer was composed of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (MP Biomedicals), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). The crude cell lysate was then left rotating end-over-end at 4 °C for 30 min to further solubilize cell membranes. Afterward, the sample was spun for 10 min at 14,000 × g to remove cellular debris. The protein concentrations of the final supernatants (cell lysates) were determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-HA or anti-MYC antibodies conjugated to agarose beads (Profound IP/Co-IP kits; Pierce). Briefly, cell lysates (∼750 μlor ∼600 μg) were transferred to spin columns and either anti-HA or anti-MYC-agarose beads added (10 μg) followed by end-over-end rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. The columns were then spun to remove the cell lysate, and the beads then washed three times with extraction buffer (500 μl each). The immunoprecipitated proteins bound to the agarose beads were then eluted three times (10 μl each) with pH 2.8 elution buffer (Pierce). The acidic protein sample was then immediately neutralized with 1.5 μlof 1 m Tris, pH 9.5. Western blotting was performed using standard methodology. The eluted protein samples (∼30 μl) were added to 7.5 μl of a 5× SDS loading buffer (0.3 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 50% glycerol, and a lane tracking dye) that also contained β-mercaptoethanol (∼10%). The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C. A portion of the denatured protein sample (∼20 μl) was then separated by gel electrophoresis using 4-15% or 8-16% Tris-HCl glycine polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore). PVDF membranes were first incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk powder in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody as follows: (1:1000) HRP-conjugated anti-HA 12CA5 antibody (Roche Applied Science); (1:1000) HRP-conjugated anti-MYC 9E10 antibody (Roche Applied Science); (1:1000) HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody, or 5-10 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 antibody (F-3165; Sigma). For anti-FLAG immunodetection using the non-HRP-conjugated antibody (F-3165), membranes were washed in blocking buffer (five times) and subsequently incubated for 1 h with an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer (sc-2318; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following all antibody incubations, PVDF membranes were washed four times (15 min each) with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, followed by two times (20 min each) with TBS. HRP-immunoreactive protein bands were then resolved by enhanced chemiluminescence (Luminol; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected by exposure to blue-sensitive autoradiography film (Midwest Scientific). For some PVDF membranes, antibodies were stripped and re-probed with a different antibody. Electrophysiological recordings from CHO-K1 cells were performed using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique as described previously (42Jaen C. Doupnik C.A. Neuropharmacology. 2005; 49: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 46Doupnik C.A. Jaen C. Zhang Q. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 131-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GFP-positive cells were identified by epifluorescence microscopy. Whole-cell recordings were performed with a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch-1D; Axon Instruments) using patch pipettes having tip resistances of 3-5 megohms. Cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of -100 mV, with voltage ramps from -100 to +50 mV (0.5 s in duration) applied before and during ACh application to monitor inward rectification of the ACh-evoked Kir3 currents (IK,ACh). All experiments were performed at room temperature (21-23 °C). During whole-cell recording, cells were superfused with a high K+ external solution to resolve the kinetics of inward IK,ACh. The composition of the external solution was (in mm)as follows: NaCl 125, KCl 25, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, HEPES 5, pH 7.4. Rapid application and washout of different ACh concentrations was performed using a multibarrel perfusion system (SF-77B; Warner Instruments) that had a time constant for solution exchange of ∼200 ms (46Doupnik C.A. Jaen C. Zhang Q. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 131-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The composition of the internal pipette solution was (in mm) as follows: KCl 120, NaCl 10, MgCl2 5, EGTA 1, HEPES 5, ATP 5, GTP 0.2, pH 7.2. All procedures for the use and handling of Xenopus laevis (Xenopus One, Ann Arbor, MI) were approved by the University of South Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Oocytes were injected with a mixture of 5′-capped cRNAs synthesized in vitro from linearized cDNA vectors (mMessage mMachine, Ambion). Experimental groups (∼20 oocytes each) were injected with different cRNA mixtures (50 nl final volume) and incubated at 19 °C in parallel for 48-60 h. All groups received cRNAs for the human muscarinic m2 receptor (0.5 ng/oocyte), rat Kir3.1 subunit (0.5 ng/oocyte), and mouse Kir3.2a subunit (0.5 ng/oocyte). Expressions of RGS4(C2V)-FLAG, RGS3s-FLAG, and RGS4-(58-205)-FLAG were varied by including different amounts of cRNA (0, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 ng/oocyte). ACh-activated Kir3 channel currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp methods from a holding potential of -80 mV (GeneClamp 500; Axon Instruments). Oocytes were initially superfused with a minimal salt solution (98 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and then switched to an isotonic high K+ solution (20 mm KCl, 78 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) to resolve the kinetics of ACh-activated inward Kir3 channel currents. Rapid application and washout of ACh in the high K+ solution was performed using a computer-triggered superfusion system (SF-77B; Warner Instruments) (46Doupnik C.A. Jaen C. Zhang Q. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 131-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To monitor inward rectification of IK,ACh, voltage ramps from -80 to +20 mV and 1 s in duration were evoked before and during agonist application. All recordings were performed at room temperature (21-23 °C). Time-dependent Kir3 current kinetics were analyzed using nonlinear curve fitting software that fit single exponential functions to derive activation time constants (τact) and deactivation time constants (τdeact) (Clampfit 8.0 software; Axon Instruments). Agonist dose-response relations were analyzed by fitting peak current amplitudes with a Hill function, where the effective concentration producing a 50% response (EC50) and Hill coefficient value (nH) were derived from the best fit (Origin 6.0 software, OriginLab Corp.). Pairwise statistical analysis between experimental groups was performed by one-way analysis of variance, where p < 0.05 was considered significant. Comparative RGS Protein Expression in CHO-K1 Cells— To determine whether RGS4 or RGS3s can associate with GPCR-Kir3 channel complexes, we co-expressed N-terminal HA-tagged m2 receptors, C-terminal MYC-tagged Kir3.1/Kir3.2a channels, with and without C-terminal FLAG-tagged RGS3s or RGS4 in CHO-K1 cells. The HA-m2 receptor or the Kir3.1-MYC subunit was then immunoprecipitated and probed for co-precipitating proteins by Western blot analysis similar to that described by Lavine et al. (35Lavine N. Ethier N. Oak J.N. Pei L. Liu F. Trieu P. Rebois R.V. Bouvier M. Hebert T.E. Van Tol H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46010-46019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Initial Western blot analysis of cell lysates reaffirmed previous findings indicating RGS4 protein levels are low and often undetectable (24Davydov I.V. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22931-22941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 47Krumins A.M. Barker S.A. Huang C. Sunahara R.K. Yu K. Wilkie T.M. Gold S.J. Mumby S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2593-2599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and significantly less than RGS3s (Fig. 1A). This has been attributed to the rapid degradation of RGS4 via the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent N-end rule pathway initiated by arginylation of RGS4 at Cys-2 (24Davydov I.V. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22931-22941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25Lee M.J. Tasaki T. Moroi K. An J.Y. Kimura S. Davydov I.V. Kwon Y.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15030-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). RGS3s notably lacks this N-terminal cysteine residue. We therefore also compared protein levels of the degradation-resistant RGS4(C2V) mutant (24Davydov I.V. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22931-22941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the level of RGS4(C2V) protein in the cell lysate was significantly greater than wild type RGS4 and more comparable with the protein levels observed with RGS3s expression. Both RGS3s-FLAG (23.5 kDa) and RGS4(C2V)-FLAG (24.25 kDa) migrated near their calculated molecular weights and were often accompanied by a slightly smaller band of lower intensity that may represent some degree of proteolysis or an alternative translation initiation start site (24Davydov I.V. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22931-22941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 47Krumins A.M. Barker S.A. Huang C. Sunahara R.K. Yu K. Wilkie T.M. Gold S.J. Mumby S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2593-2599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Given the similar and stable expression levels of RGS3s and RGS4(C2V), we routinely used RGS4(C2V) for immunodetection and for comparisons with RGS3s. Functional tests of co-expressed HA-tagged m2 receptors with Kir3.1-MYC/Kir3.2a channels revealed ACh-elicited inwardly rectifying K+ currents were indistinguishable from those produced by their untagged counterparts reported previously (42Jaen C. Doupnik C.A. Neuropharmacology. 2005; 49: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Comparative analysis of the modulatory effects of FLAG-tagged RGS3s, RGS4, and RGS4(C2V) on the kinetics of IK,ACh activation and deactivation indicated all three RGS proteins accelerated Kir3 channel gating properties to similar extents (Fig. 1, D and E). This was somewhat unexpected given the large difference in protein expression between RGS4 and RGS4(C2V), and indicates RGS4 protein levels (significantly lower than RGS3s and RGS4(C2V)) are saturating with regard to functional Kir3 channel modulation. Also consistent with our previous study (42Jaen C. Doupnik C.A. Neuropharmacology. 2005; 49: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar),"
https://openalex.org/W2055166376,"The Na+-pumping NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase has six polypeptide subunits (NqrA–F) and a number of redox cofactors, including a noncovalently bound FAD and a 2Fe-2S center in subunit F, covalently bound FMNs in subunits B and C, and a noncovalently bound riboflavin in an undisclosed location. The FMN cofactors in subunits B and C are bound to threonine residues by phosphoester linkages. A neutral flavin-semiquinone radical is observed in the oxidized enzyme, whereas an anionic flavin-semiquinone has been reported in the reduced enzyme. For this work, we have altered the binding ligands of the FMNs in subunits B and C by replacing the threonine ligands with other amino acids, and we studied the resulting mutants by EPR and electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy. We conclude that the sodium-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase forms three spectroscopically distinct flavin radicals as follows: 1) a neutral radical in the oxidized enzyme, which is observed in all of the mutants and most likely arises from the riboflavin; 2) an anionic radical observed in the fully reduced enzyme, which is present in wild type, and the NqrC-T225Y mutant but not the NqrB-T236Y mutant; 3) a second anionic radical, seen primarily under weakly reducing conditions, which is present in wild type, and the NqrB-T236Y mutant but not the NqrC-T225Y mutant. Thus, we can tentatively assign the first anionic radical to the FMN in subunit B and the second to the FMN in subunit C. The second anionic radical has not been reported previously. In electron nuclear double resonance spectra, it exhibits a larger line width and larger 8α-methyl proton splittings, compared with the first anionic radical.

The Na+-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) 3The abbreviations used are: Na+-NQR, sodium-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase; ENDOR, electron nuclear double resonance; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CW, continuous wave. is a primary sodium pump present in the inner membrane of many marine and pathogenic bacteria, including Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Haemophilus influenzae, and Vibrio cholerae. This enzyme oxidizes NADH and reduces ubiquinone as the first step in the aerobic respiratory chain. The free energy from the electron transfer reaction is harnessed to the translocation of sodium ions across the membrane, creating a sodium motive force, which is used by the cell for metabolic work (1Barquera B.

Na+-NQR is made of six subunits that accommodate several cofactors as follows: one noncovalently bound FAD and a 2Fe-2S center in subunit F; two covalently bound FMNs in subunits B and C; and riboflavin in an unknown location (1Barquera B.

The covalently bound FMNs in Na+-NQR are bound to the protein by phosphoester bonds between the phosphate of the FMN and the –OH group of a threonine residue (Thr-236 in NqrB and Thr-225 in NqrC). In both cases the threonine is part of a highly conserved sequence of amino acids, SGAT (11Hayashi M. Nakayama Y. Yasui M. Maeda M. Furuishi K. Unemoto T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Barquera B. Hase C.C. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Nakayama Y. Yasui M.

The role of these FMNs in electron transfer and in Na+ translocation has not been elucidated. An unusual feature of Na+-NQR is the occurrence of more than one flavin radical. In a previous EPR spectroscopy study, we showed that the air-oxidized enzyme (resting state) exhibits a neutral flavin semiquinone, whereas in the reduced enzyme, an anionic flavin semiquinone deprotonated at the N(5) position of the isoalloxazine ring (15Barquera B.

Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Neither of these signals has been assigned to any of the flavins in Na+-NQR. However, both signals were observed in mutants, such as NqrF-S246A, where the FAD cofactor has been knocked out, indicating that the radical signals must arise from other flavins of the enzyme. In this paper, we present new mutations, which eliminate two of the remaining three flavins as follows: the covalently bound FMNs in subunits B and C. Using these mutants, together with the wild-type enzyme, we have now made the first detailed ENDOR study of the flavin radicals of Na+-NQR. The results reveal a new anionic flavin radical in the partially reduced enzyme that has a larger line width and larger 8α-methyl proton splittings than the anionic flavin radical in the fully reduced enzyme. Our findings allow us to tentatively assign the neutral radical C to the riboflavin cofactor, the anionic radical II, from the partially reduced enzyme, to the FMN in NqrC, and the anionic radical I, from the fully reduced enzyme, to the FMN in NqrB. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—V. cholerae O395N1ΔnqrA-F, which lacks the genomic copy of the nqr operon, was used as host for expression of the wild-type and mutant Na+-NQRs. Cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C. Escherichia coli TOP10 (Invitrogen)-competent cells were used for mutagenesis. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The plasmid pBAD-nqr was used as template for mutagenesis and also for expression of the recombinant wild-type Na+-NQR and mutants. Mutants in the NqrB-T236 and NqrC-T225 residues were constructed using the primers listed in Table 1. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using “Quikchange” kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutations were checked by restriction digestions, using restriction sites introduced by means of silent mutations in the mutagenesis primers. The mutations were subsequently confirmed by direct DNA sequencing from the mutated plasmids. Mutated plasmids were introduced into V. cholerae O395N1ΔnqrA-F by electroporation as reported previously (1Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Hase C.C. Gosink K.K. Nilges M. Bruesehoff P.J.

Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Hase C.C. Gosink K.K. Nilges M. Bruesehoff P.J. Roth A. Lancaster C.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3781-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This was followed by gel filtration on D-Salt Polyacrylamide 6000 (Pierce) using a buffer (“final buffer”) containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.05% dodecyl maltoside (Anatrace, Maumee, OH). The resulting preparations were frozen in aliquots and stored at liquid nitrogen temperature. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce, and SDS-PAGE containing 6 m urea (4–16% acrylamide) was used to check the purity of the proteins. Steady state turnover of Na+-NQR was measured as either 1) oxidation of NADH and reduction of Q-1 (ubiquinone analog) or 2) oxidation of NADH and reduction of the artificial electron acceptor ferricyanide. These reactions were followed spectrophotometrically, using a full-spectrum method as reported before (1Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Hase C.C. Gosink K.K. Nilges M. Bruesehoff P.J. Roth A. Lancaster C.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3781-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). UV-visible Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectra were recorded on an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. Flavin Analysis by Denaturation, Visible and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Wild-type and mutant enzymes were denatured by addition of 6 m guanidine chloride. The denatured protein was passed through a Centricon filter (3 kDa molecular mass cutoff) to remove the protein and the covalently bound flavins. The amount of flavin in the sample, before and after filtration, was measured by absorbance (UV-visible) and by fluorescence spectroscopy. HPLC Analysis of Noncovalently Bound Flavins—The filtrate obtained as described above was also analyzed by HPLC as described previously (1Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Hase C.C. Gosink K.K. Nilges M. Bruesehoff P.J. Roth A. Lancaster C.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3781-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). EPR and ENDOR Experiments—X-band EPR spectra were collected on a Varian E-122 spectrometer. The samples were run as frozen glasses at ∼60 K using an Air Products Helitran cryostat with liquid helium. Pulsed ENDOR spectra were collected on a Bruker E580-10 Elexsys spectrometer. Samples were maintained at 85 K using liquid helium in an Oxford CF935 cryostat controlled by an Oxford ITC-4 temperature controller. Pulsed ENDOR experiments were carried out using a Davies three-pulse scheme (π -T-π /2-τ-π -τ-echo, with the RF pulse applied during time T). The magnetic fields were calibrated with a Varian NMR gauss meter. All instruments were maintained by the Illinois EPR Research Center, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. EPR spectra were simulated with the “SIMPOW6” program developed at the University of Illinois, which is based upon “QPOW” (17Nilges, M. J. (1979) Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Studies of Low Symmetry Nickel(I) and Molybdenum(V) Complexes. Ph.D. thesis, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignGoogle Scholar). ENDOR spectra were simulated using “SIMEND,” which is a version of “SIMPIP” that calculates a frequency-swept spectrum and includes an intensity weighting function for the Boltzman population and for angle selection. The angle selection is determined primarily by the anisotropic N(5) and N(10) hyperfine splittings, as well as the H(5) proton hyperfine splitting in the case of the neutral radical shown in Equation 1, where n and m run over all spin levels; TM is the transition moment; β is the Boltzman population; Hun and Hmv are calculated using first-order perturbation theory, and the anisotropic Gaussian line width ΔH (θ,φ) is obtained by fitting the residual line width because of the remaining protons other than H (5Tokuda H. Unemoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7785-7790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contributions from the individual protons are calculated separately and then summed together. Because the sensitivity decreases with frequency because of instrumentation, an empirical weighting or roll-off function was added as Equation 2, G(ν)=11+(ν/ν0)n(Eq. 2) where n is found to be around 2.6–2.8 and ν0 is ∼4 MHz. This correction is an empirical one that also includes corrections for other sources of frequency-dependent sensitivity such as relaxation. Mutations of the Threonine Ligands of the Covalently Bound FMNs—The FMN cofactors in Na+-NQR subunits B and C are both covalently attached by phosphoester bonds to threonine residues: Thr-236 in NqrB and Thr-225 in NqrC. In both cases the threonine is part of a highly conserved sequence of amino acids (SGAT) (11Hayashi M. Nakayama Y. Yasui M. Maeda M. Furuishi K. Unemoto T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Barquera B. Hase C.C. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The same sequence has recently been identified as part of an FMN-binding site in the NosR flavoprotein of Pseudomonas stutzeri (18Wunsch P. Zumft W.G. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1992-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As part of our ongoing project to study the spectroscopy and redox chemistry of the flavins in Na+-NQR, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to change NqrB-T236 and NqrC-T225 to different amino acids. The objective was to either eliminate or perturb each FMN cofactor individually to study the effect on enzyme activity and on the flavin radicals. The NqrB subunit is hydrophobic, with at least eight predicted transmembrane helices. Threonine 236 is predicted to be located in a hydrophilic loop. NqrB-T236 was mutated to serine, alanine, cysteine, leucine, and tyrosine. The serine mutant enzyme was very much like the wild type. The enzyme was active, and all cofactors were incorporated, including the covalently bound flavin in subunit B. This is consistent with the fact that serine has an –OH group and can replace threonine in forming a phosphoester bond. The alanine, cysteine, and leucine mutations resulted in enzymes that were too unstable to be studied. The tyrosine mutant (NqrB-T236Y) assembled but did not incorporate the covalently bound FMN in NqrB. Wild-type Na+-NQR shows two fluorescent bands in PAGE, corresponding to subunits NqrB and NqrC, whereas the NqrB tyrosine mutant showed only one fluorescent band, corresponding to the NqrC subunit (Fig. 1), although all six subunits could be observed in Coomassie-stained gels (not shown). Analysis of the total flavin content by UV-visible spectra and fluorescence (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed that the mutant enzyme contained ∼2.3 flavins, and that the ratio of covalently to noncovalently bound flavins was about 1:2.3. HPLC analysis of the soluble flavins showed that the noncovalently bound FAD and riboflavin cofactors were present in the mutant, although the riboflavin was apparently present in a stoichiometry of only 30% consistent with the smaller amount of flavin detected by the UV-visible and fluorescence assays (Fig. 2 and Table 2). EPR spectra of the reduced enzyme showed that the 2Fe-2S center was also assembled (Fig. 4). The enzyme was not able to carry out its physiological reaction, measured as transport electrons from NADH to Q1, but was active with NADH and the artificial substrate ferricyanide, which is believed to accept electrons from the FAD cofactor in NqrF (rate, ∼300 μmol reduced ferricyanide min–1 mg –1) (1Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Hase C.C. Gosink K.K. Nilges M. Bruesehoff P.J. Roth A. Lancaster C.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3781-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the NqrB-T236Y enzyme assembles with all cofactors except the covalently bound FMN in NqrB. This made it an ideal vehicle to study the role of this flavin in the formation of the radical signals of Na+-NQR.FIGURE 2HPLC elution profile of the soluble flavins in Na+-NQR after denaturation by 6 m guanidine-HCl.

Samples were prepared under anaerobic conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The NqrC subunit is relatively hydrophilic and is predicted to have one or two transmembrane helices. The conserved motif (SGAT) that includes Thr-225 is predicted to be in a large hydrophilic loop. NqrC-T225 was mutated to leucine (not shown) and to tyrosine. In both cases the Na+-NQR complex was expressed and assembled, but without incorporation of the covalently bound flavin in NqrC. An SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1) shows that the NqrCT225Y mutant exhibits only one fluorescent band, corresponding to NqrB. Although the NqrC protein is seen under subsequent Coomassie Blue staining, only the NqrB band is fluorescent indicative of a covalently bound flavin. The NqrC mutants were more stable (i.e. easier to obtain in good yield) than any of the NqrB mutants, probably indicating that FMN in NqrB plays a role in the assembly of the Na+-NQR complex. The NqrC-T225Y preparation was found to contain the same amount of FAD and riboflavin, per unit of protein, as the wild-type enzyme (not shown). The NqrC mutants were also inactive in NADH:quinone oxidoreductase activity but, like the NqrB mutants, were active when ferricyanide was used as an electron acceptor (rate, ∼300 μmol of reduced ferricyanide min–1 mg –1). CW EPR Results—Because Na+-NQR exhibits flavin radical EPR signals, we used EPR spectroscopy to study the NqrB-T236Y and NqrC-T225Y mutants in more depth. The EPR spectra of the wild-type Na+-NQR and the NqrC-T225Y mutant are compared in Fig. 3. For the air-oxidized enzyme, the EPR spectra of the wild-type and NqrC-T225Y are identical and have the same 20.0 G line width, which is typical for a neutral flavin radical (19Galli C. MacArthur R. Abu-Soud H. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 38: 2804-2810Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Kay C.W. Feicht R. Schulz K. Sadewater P. Sancar A. Bacher A. Mobius K. Richter G. Weber S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16740-16748Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For the enzyme reduced with NADH or sodium dithionite, the spectra are very similar, but some minor differences are seen in line width and intensity. In the case of dithionite reduction, the line width of the radical is slightly smaller (13.6 G) for NqrC-T225Y than for the wild type (14.6 G), although both values are typical for anionic flavin radicals (21Edmonson D.E. Berliner L.J. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1978: 205-235Google Scholar). With NADH reduction the observed line widths are slightly larger than those with dithionite reduction (15Barquera B. Morgan J.E. Lukoyanov D. Scholes C.P. Gennis R.B. Nilges M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For NqrC-T225Y the value is 14.7 G, whereas for the wild-type it is 15.3 G. Thus, the EPR of the NqrC-T225Y and the wild type show only small differences, primarily slightly narrower lines for the NqrC-T225Y under reducing conditions. The flavin radical EPR signals of the NqrC-T225Y mutant are similar to those of the wild-type enzyme, as are those of the FAD and 2Fe-2S mutants (10Barquera B. Nilges M.J. Morgan J.E. Ramirez-Silva L. Zhou W. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12322-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Aliverti A. Hagen W.R. Zanetti G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, the EPR spectra of the NqrB-T236Y mutant show a number of significant differences compared with the wild-type enzyme. Most important is that reduction of the enzyme by dithionite can result in complete abolition of the free radical signal. As shown in Fig. 4, as the concentration of dithionite is increased, the amplitude of the free radical signal decreases until it is essentially gone at concentrations above 10 mm. In the case of NADH, the effects are not as great, but the flavin radical signal is still found to decrease as the concentration of NADH is increased (supplemental Fig. S1). At face value, these results suggest that the FMN in NqrB is the parent of the anionic flavin radical. Air-oxidized samples of NqrB-T236Y give rise to an EPR signal with a line width of 20 G, which is characteristic of a neutral radical. However, the spin concentration is less than a third of that seen in wild-type samples (radical to 2Fe-2S ratio of 0.28:1). The highest concentration of flavin radical is seen when the concentration of reductant is around 0.3 mm (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S1) where the ratio of radical concentration to 2Fe-2S concentration is found to be around 0.45 to 1. The line width of the flavin radical signal decreases upon reduction; this line narrowing is significant even at low concentrations of reductant. For reduction with dithionite, the line narrows to 15.6 G, whereas for reduction with NADH it narrows to 16.6 G. This narrowing suggests that a significant amount of anionic flavin radical is still formed upon reduction of this mutant, even though the radical disappears under strongly reducing conditions. If mutation of NqrB-T236 to tyrosine prevents the incorporation of FMN into this subunit, as indicated by our gel results, and if the FMN in NqrB is the source of the anionic radical as suggested by the disappearance of the radical signal under strongly reducing conditions, then one would expect that this enzyme would exhibit only the EPR signal with a line width of 20 G corresponding to the neutral radical. The significant narrowing of the radical signal, especially in the initial stages of reduction, would appear to be inconsistent with the assignment of the anionic flavin radical to the FMN of NqrB. ENDOR Spectra of Wild-type Na+-NQR under Oxidizing and Fully Reducing Conditions—As noted in our earlier work (1Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Hase C.C. Gosink K.K. Nilges M. Bruesehoff P.J. Roth A. Lancaster C.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3781-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Barquera B. Morgan J.E. Lukoyanov D. Scholes C.P. Gennis R.B. Nilges M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), ENDOR spectroscopy is much more definitive in distinguishing between neutral and anionic flavin radicals. In particular, the splittings from the C(8α)-methyl protons are quite distinct for neutral and anion flavin radicals; couplings are typically <10 MHz for neutral radicals and >10 MHz for anion radicals. To understand why an anionic flavin radical is still present in the NqrB mutant under certain conditions and to confirm that radicals observed in the NqrB mutant are indeed the same neutral and anionic radicals observed in wild-type samples, we have performed pulsed ENDOR experiments on the NqrB and NqrC mutants as well as wild-type Na+-NQR. The ENDOR spectrum of the enzyme under weakly reducing conditions is expected to include contributions from both neutral and anionic flavin radicals, and the contributing spectra are expected to overlap to some extent. To better aid the analysis of such mixed spectra, we have used spectral simulation. As a prerequisite, it was first necessary to be able to correctly simulate the complete spectra of both the pure neutral and pure anionic radicals. To simulate the spectrum of the neutral or anionic flavin radical, it was necessary to include not only the splittings from the C(8α), C(6), C(1′)H1, C(9), and C(7α) protons that were reported earlier (15Barquera B. Morgan J.E. Lukoyanov D. Scholes C.P. Gennis R.B. Nilges M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but also the second proton, C(1′)H2, on the ribityl side chain and the N(3) amide proton. Because peaks with small hyperfine splittings can be suppressed when the length of the tπ pulse is small, tπ was set to 320 ns so as to minimize distortion of the central part of the ENDOR spectrum around 14.5 MHz, the proton Zeeman frequency. This central region includes splittings from the C(9), C(7α), and N(3) protons. For a value of tπ of 320 ns, most but not all of the matrix peak, which is primarily because of remote protons such as those at more distant positions on the ribityl side chain, is suppressed. To compensate for this, a generalized matrix peak was added in the simulations. Because the proton ENDOR spectra consist of a large number overlapping peaks, simulation is not straightforward. Several strategies were employed to make this problem tractable. To provide a more complete basis for the simulations, spectra were acquired with the magnetic field set near the EPR absorption maximum (g = 2.0026) and also with the field set 25 G (g = 1.9899) above the absorption maximum. Unlike the ENDOR spectrum obtained with the field set to the absorption maximum, ENDOR data obtained with the field set off-center show significant angle selection because of the highly anisotropic N(5) and N(10) couplings. This results in a “single crystal-like” z axis spectrum. In addition, the absorption and first derivative spectra were both used to judge the goodness of the simulation. Only a simulation that consistently fit both the 0- and 1-derivative spectra could be chosen as “best fit.” Also, the choice of starting values used in simulations was guided by DFT calculations of the FAD flavin radical in DNA photolyase (23Weber S. Mobius K. Richter G. Kay C.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3790-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) as well as our own DFT calculations of the neutral and anionic flavin radicals using the structure of the FMN radical in flavodoxin from Clostridium beijerinckii (24Ludwig M.L. Pattridge K.A. Metzger A.L. Dixon M.M. Eren M. Feng Y. Swenson R.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1259-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); see the Supplemental Material. Figs. 5 and 6 and Tables 3 and 4 show the simulations for the neutral and anionic flavin radicals, respectively. As can be seen, the simulations reproduce the shape of the ENDOR spectra very well. These simulations do not include contributions from the N(5) and N(10) nitrogens or the contribution of the N(5) proton, in the case of the neutral radical. The N(5) and N(10) nitrogens and the N(5) proton have highly anisotropic hyperfine"

Based on our data, we propose a stochastic nucleotide binding and a coordinated hydrolysis mechanism in PspF1–275 hexamers. The members of the functionally versatile AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) 3The abbreviations used are: AAA+ proteins, ATPases associated with various cellular activities; EBP, enhancer-binding protein; Eσ54, σ54-RNA polymerase holoenzyme; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; PspF, phage shock protein F; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate. 3The abbreviations used are: AAA+ proteins, ATPases associated with various cellular activities; EBP, enhancer-binding protein; Eσ54, σ54-RNA polymerase holoenzyme; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; PspF, phage shock protein F; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate. protein family are found in all kingdoms of life.

AAA+ proteins share Walker A (consensus sequence GXXXXGK (Thr/Ser)) and Walker B (consensus sequence HHHHDE, where H represents hydrophobic amino acids) motifs that are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively, and a second region of homology (5Ogura T.

Usually, AAA+ proteins form hexameric rings in their active conformation, often assembled from inactive dimers (7Beuron F. Flynn T.C. Ma J. Kondo H. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. J. Mol.

The nucleotide binding sites of AAA+ proteins lie at the interface between subunits permitting determinants from adjacent subunits to contribute to nucleotide hydrolysis. The energy derived from NTP hydrolysis is usually coupled to substrate remodeling and functional output (6Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In AAA+ proteins the more general unresolved question is if and how nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are coordinated within hexameric AAA+ ring structures for their biological output. Founded on studies of the nucleotide occupancy, two basic models may serve to distinguish how AAA+ molecular machines function (10Ades S.E. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 46-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The homogeneous nucleotide occupancy observed in a large number of AAA+ crystal structures (11Lenzen C.U.

Other structures showed sub-stoichiometric and mixed nucleotide occupancy within the hexameric ring (14Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R.

Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 79: 339-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)). ATP hydrolysis by the AAA+ domain of EBPs is used to isomerize the Eσ54-closed promoter complex to a transcriptional competent open complex (17Wigneshweraraj S.R. Burrows P.C. Bordes P. Schumacher J.

The Eσ54 transcriptional activator PspF activates transcription of Psp regulon genes from pspA-E and pspG promoters and is negatively regulated by PspA (28Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J.

Bordes et al. (32Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Zhang X. Chaney M. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ADP·AlFx·PspF1–275·Eσ54 trap complex appears to be an intermediate en route for open complex formation. However, the ADP·AlFx·PspF1–275·Eσ54promoter complex cannot isomerize to an open complex (4Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Bordes P. Cannon W. Buck M. Mol.

Recent structural studies of a ADP·AlFx·PspF1–275·σ54 complex revealed that the connecting densities between a hexameric PspF1–275 and σ54 critically involve some but not all of the GAFTGA loops from some but not all AAA+ domains, suggesting an asymmetrical structure (36Rappas M. Schumacher J. Beuron F. Niwa H. Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S. Keetch C.A. Robinson C.V. Buck M. Zhang X. Science. 2005; 307: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A model based on the crystal structures of PspF1–275 soaked with different nucleotides suggested a molecular mechanism within a PspF subunit by which ATP binding and hydrolysis could coordinate movements of the GAFTGA loop (37Rappas M. Schumacher J. Niwa H. Buck M. Zhang X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). How and if movements between PspF1–275 subunits are coordinated throughout nucleotide binding and hydrolysis to orchestrate a sequential multistep structural remodeling of Eσ54-closed promoter complex is unclear.We now report biochemical data to address relationships between nucleotide occupancy and functionality of PspF1–275. We determined the relative affinity for different nucleotides and observed only modest cooperative binding of ATP and ADP to PspF1–275. We show by gel filtration that PspF1–275 is in equilibrium between different oligomeric states and that either ATP or ADP binding shifts this equilibrium toward higher order oligomers, most probably hexamers. Strikingly, we found that physiological ADP concentrations stimulate the intrinsic ATPase rates of oligomeric PspF1–275, suggesting that heterogeneous nucleotide occupancy could play a functional role in the catalytic function of this AAA+ protein. Further support for mixed nucleotide binding comes from our finding that ATP at concentrations above those found in E. coli and where ATP possibly occupies all the binding sites in the PspF1–275 oligomer inhibit ATP hydrolysis and transcriptional activation. Heterogeneous nucleotide occupancy is also evident in the functionally significant ADP·AlFx·PspF1–275·Eσ54 complex. Simultaneous binding of ADP and ATP within a PspF1–275 hexamer clearly increases functionality at physiological nucleotide concentrations. Our data support probabilistic nucleotide binding in PspF1–275 hexamers with a coordinated nucleotide hydrolysis mechanism. We propose that the mechanical actions used for making open promoter complexes arise from asymmetric forms of PspF1–275 created by differential nucleotide bound states of protomers within a hexamer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNucleotides—ATP, ADP, AMPPNP, and ATPγS were from Sigma and are at the highest purity level available.

Variants of PspF1–275 were generated from plasmid pPB1 mutagenized to yield pPB1-K42A, pPB1-D107A, and pPB1-R168A (38Schumacher J. Zhang X. Jones S. Bordes P. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Protein Purification—PspF1–275-wild type, -K42A, -D107A, and -R168A were purified as described in Bordes et al. (32Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Zhang X. Chaney M. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) from, respectively, pPB1, pPB1-K42A, pPB1-D107A, and pPB1-R168A, respectively. Briefly, 1 liter of LB media was inoculated with an overnight culture (2% v/v) and grown at 37 °C until an A600 nm of 0.4–0.6. After down-shift of temperature to 25 °C, the protein production was induced with 1 mm final concentration of isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside for 3 h. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in buffer A (25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) and broken by sonication. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap™ chelating high performance column (Amersham Biosciences) precharged with nickel and purified as described in Bordes et al. (32Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Zhang X. Chaney M. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The His tag was removed by thrombin cleavage for 3 h at 23°C. Finally the protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against final storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol) and frozen at –80 °C. σ54 was purified as described (18Cannon W.V. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase core enzyme from E. coli was purchased from Epicenter.ATPase Activity—ATPase activity assays were performed in a 10-μl final volume in buffer containing final concentrations of 35 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 70 mm potassium acetate, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 19 mm ammonium acetate, 0.7 mm dithiothreitol, and different concentrations of PspF1–275. The mix was preincubated at 23 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was started by adding 3 μl of an ATP solution containing 0.6 μCi/μl of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) plus different concentrations of ATP, ADP, AMPPNP, or AMP and incubated for different times at 23 °C. In the case of ADP, AMPPNP, or AMP competition, a fixed concentration of substrate ATP (1 μm) was chosen to minimize the contribution of ATP from [α-32P] ATP. Reactions were stopped by adding 5 volumes of 2 m formic acid. [α-32P]ADP was separated from ATP by thin-layer chromatography, and radiolabeled ADP and ATP were measured by phosphorimaging (Fuji Bas-1500) and analyzed using the Aida software. Activity is expressed in turnover per minute. Reactions were stopped when around 20% of total ATP was hydrolyzed to keep the same proportion of ADP present in all reactions. The fitting curves were obtained by using the automatic sigmoidal fitting equation on Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab Corp.). All experiments were done at least in triplicate independently and gave the same results. In addition we established (data not shown) that the rate of ATP hydrolysis was linear under assay conditions.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC experiments were conducted using a MicroCal VP isothermal titration calorimeter. PspF1–275 was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C immediately before use in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2. After degassing each sample under vacuum, each nucleotide solution (in dialysis buffer) containing ATPγS, ADP, or AMPPNP (8 mm) was titrated into the protein solution (99 μm) in 70 injections of 4 μl (300 s). Raw data for 70 injections at 37 °C were obtained by using the MicroCal VP-VIEWER software. Control titrations of nucleotide into dialysis buffer demonstrated that there was no significant heat of dilution or injection for any of the tested nucleotides (data not shown). ITC data were corrected for heats of injection of nucleotide solution. Binding stoichiometry, enthalpy, entropy and binding constants were determined by fitting the corrected data to a one site binding model. The ITC data were fitted using Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Corp.). All titration were performed at least twice independently. The resultant fitting value was exactly the same.ADP-AlF Trapping—ADP-AlFx trapping experiments were performed in a 10-μl volume with final concentrations of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 50 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF, and different concentrations of PspF1–275 +/– σ54 +/– RNA polymerase core enzyme. The mix was then preincubated at 23 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of 1 μl of mix nucleotide containing 4 mm concentrations of either ADP or ATP or AMPPNP. For radiolabeled trapping experiments, this mix contained 4 mm ATP with either 20 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) or 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). AlCl3 (0.4 mm, final concentration) was then added, and the reaction was incubated for 5 min at 23 °C. After adding of 2 μl of loading buffer (50% glycerol, bromphenol blue), all of the sample was loaded onto native 4.5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 37.5:1) and run in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, + 192 mm glycine (TG buffer). Proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue straining, and radioactivity was measured by phosphorimaging (Fuji Bas-1500) and analyzed using the Aida software.Gel Filtration through Superdex 200—PspF1–275 wild type or R168A (at different concentrations) were incubated for 3 min at 4 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 15 mm MgCl2 +/– 1 mm ATP or ADP where indicated. Samples (50 μl) were then injected onto a Superdex 200 column (10 × 300 mm, 24 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) installed on an AKTA system (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with the sample buffer. Chromatography was performed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml·min–1, and columns were calibrated with globular proteins: apoferritin (443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa).Native Gel Complex Formation Assays—Heparin challenge experiments were performed in a 10-μl reaction volume with final concentrations of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 50 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 μm RNA polymerase, 0.3 μm σ54, 0.2 μm fluorescent-labeled DNA heteroduplex (HEX-labeled) assembled from purified oligonucleotides WVC7/WVC3HEX, 2 μm PspF1–275, and varying concentrations of ATP. The mix was preincubated at room temperature for 10 min, and reactions were then started by the addition of 1 μl of ATP solution at different concentrations and incubated for 1 min at 23 °C; 2 μl of a stop mix containing heparin (1 mg/ml) in loading buffer were then added to the reaction mixture. The competitor challenging reaction was performed for 2 min at 23 °C, and all samples were loaded onto a running (to further stop the reaction) native 4.5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide 37.5/1) and run in 1× TG buffer. Fluorescence was directly scanned by fluoroimaging (Fuji Bas-1500) and analyzed using the Aida software.RESULTSPspF1–275 Has Low Binding Affinity for Nucleotides—Nucleoside triphosphate binding has been shown to promote oligomer assembly and/or substrate binding in a number of AAA+ proteins (39Mitchell A.H. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 40Hersch G.L. Burton R.E. Bolon D.N. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T.

Biol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). For some AAA+ proteins, using ITC, ADP and ATPγS dissociation constants (KD) have been reported in the low μm range (see Ref. 8DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar for p97 and Ref. 42Kazmirski S.L. Podobnik M. Weitze T.F. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16750-16755Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar for replication factor C). A much higher KD (90 μm) for ATPγS was reported for the EBP NtrC (43Rombel I. Peters-Wendisch P. Mesecar A. Thorgeirsson T. Shin Y.K. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A high KD for EBP would agree with the proposed high nucleotide off-rate for ATP (41Schumacher J. Joly N. Rappas M. Zhang X. Buck M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 43Rombel I. Peters-Wendisch P. Mesecar A. Thorgeirsson T. Shin Y.K. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have used ITC to determine the affinity constant of different nucleotides for PspF1–275 in the presence of magnesium at 37 °C (Fig. 1). We have determined a KD of 34 μm for ATPγS with a Hill constant of 1.33 (Fig. 1A). The KD for ADP was 118 μm with a Hill constant of 1.33 (Fig. 1B), indicating that nucleotide binding sites of PspF1–275 within the oligomer have a very low cooperativity for binding ATPγS or ADP. Schumacher et al. (38Schumacher J. Zhang X. Jones S. Bordes P. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) showed a 50% loss of PspF1–275 ATPase activity in the presence of a 3 ADP to 1 ATP ratio, in agreement with 3-fold higher affinity for ATP compared with ADP. The 3-fold higher KD for ADP compared with ATPγS suggests that affinities for ATPγS and ATP are similar. Taken together, these results show that the affinity of EBPs for ADP and ATP are significantly lower than those reported for several other AAA+ proteins. This would explain why we could not obtained faithful heat readings in ITC experiments at low nucleotide concentrations (molar ratio <1). Therefore, we did not determine stoichiometry constants for these nucleotides. We tested AMP binding to PspF1–275 using ITC. No change in energy could be detected, suggesting that PspF1–275 has a very low affinity for AMP. This is consistent with results from AMP competition experiments in ATPase assays with PspF1–275, where a 100,000-fold excess of AMP over ATP was required to partly inhibit ATP hydrolysis (data not shown).The PspF1–275 Catalytic AAA+ Domain Forms an Apohexamer—AAA+ proteins usually function as hexameric ring assemblies (for review, see Ref. 4Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Bordes P. Cannon W. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). ATP binding is thought to promote hexamer assembly from lower oligomers (39Mitchell A.H. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but hexamer formation using a physiologically relevant ATP concentration has not been demonstrated for any EBP, probably due to the high off-rate for ATP (see above) and/or turnover (turnover around 23 min–1; see below). High order oligomer formation from PspF1–275 lower-order oligomers was suggested by the strong concentration-dependent ATPase activity of PspF1–275. To date the only nucleotide reported to lead to stable PspF1–275 hexamer formation is ADP-AlFx, a non-hydrolyzable ATP hydrolysis transition state mimic used in nucleotide saturating conditions (31Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M.

At low concentrations of PspF1–275 (9 μm) the major form of PspF1–275 elutes at 13.76 ml, which corresponds, based on reference elution volumes obtain for different protein standards (Fig. 2A), to an elution volume expected for an apparent dimer of PspF1–275 (66 kDa). At increasing concentrations of PspF1–275, the apparent number of PspF1–275 monomers (33 kDa) present in the major complex increases from 2 (66 kDa) to a maximum of 6 (198 kDa) (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2PspF1–275 filtration through a Superdex 200 column.

https://openalex.org/W2015074268,"Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV e antigen (HBeAg), a secreted protein and not required for viral replication, is thought to play an immunoregulatory role during viral infection. However, the functional involvement of HBeAg in host immune response has not been fully elucidated. We report in this study that HBeAg can bind to interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays an important role in inflammation and regulation of immune response, and membrane form of IL-1RAcP (mIL-1RAcP) is an essential component of trimeric IL-1/IL-1 receptor/mIL-1RAcP complex. We show that glutathione S-transferase- or polyhistidine-tagged recombinant HBeAg can interact with endogenous mIL-1RAcP in vitro. Purified (His)6-HBeAg added in the culture medium can interact with overexpressed FLAG-tagged mIL-1RAcP in vivo. Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy show that HBeAg colocalizes with mIL-1RAcP on the cell surface. Furthermore, HBeAg is able to induce the interaction of IL-1 receptor I (IL-1RI) with mIL-1RAcP and trigger the recruitment of adaptor protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) to the IL-1RI/mIL-1RAcP complex. Assembly and activation of IL-1RI/mIL-1RAcP signaling complex by HBeAg can activate downstream NF-κB pathway through IκB degradation, induce NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression, and induce the expression of IL-1-responsive genes. Silencing of IL-1RAcP by small interfering RNA dramatically abolishes HBeAg-mediated NF-κB activation. These results demonstrate that HBeAg can trigger host IL-1 response by binding to mIL-1RAcP.

Patients with persistent HBV infection are at a high risk of developing chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1Beasley R.P.

HBV e antigen (HBeAg), a 17-kDa secreted protein, is not a structural component of virion nor is it required for viral assembly, replication, or infection. However, conservation of HBeAg in genomes of all hepadnaviruses suggests an important role of HBeAg in HBV infection. The presence of HBeAg in the sera of patients generally indicates ongoing HBV replication and host liver disease. Most individuals with anti-e antibodies tend to have lower levels of viremia and remission of liver disease (3Realdi G. Alberti A. Rugge M. Bortolotti F. Rigoli A.M. Tremolada F. Ruol A. Gastroenterology. 1980; 79: 195-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). However, a significant number of HBeAg-negative carriers have elevated levels of HBV and active liver disease. In these carriers, HBV genome usually harbors mutations that prevent the production of HBeAg (4Baumert T.F. Liang T.J. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 184-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ou J.H. J.

These HBeAg-negative variants are often found in acute fulminant rather than chronic HBV infection in neonatal infection and in fulminant hepatitis than in self-limited hepatitis in adult acute infection (7Carman W.F.

Res. 1991; 29: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). During chronic infection in some patients, the emergence of HBeAg-negative variants correlates with an exacerbation of liver injury and sometimes even with viral clearance (12Brunetto M.R. Giarin M.M. Oliveri F. Chiaberge E. Baldi M. Alfarano A. Serra A. Saracco G. Verme G. Will H. Bonino F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In murine models, HBeAg preferentially elicits Th2-like response and has the potential to preferentially deplete HBeAg- and core-specific Th1 cells (16Milich D.R. Chen M.K. Hughes J.L. Jones J.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2013-2021PubMed Google Scholar, 17Milich D.R. Schodel F. Hughes J.L. Jones J.E. Peterson D.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2192-2201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that HBeAg plays an immunoregulatory role and promotes viral persistence. With regard to hepatocellular carcinogenesis, HBeAg-positive patients have significantly elevated risk of developing HCC (18Yang H.I. Lu S.N. Liaw Y.F. You S.L. Sun C.A. Wang L.Y. Hsiao C.K. Chen P.J. Chen D.S. Chen C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that HBeAg plays an important role in the chronicity and carcinogenesis of HBV infection. Despite these important clinical implications, the functional involvement of HBeAg in HBV infection and the molecular mechanism of HBeAg-host interactions remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that HBeAg can interact with host interleukin-1 receptor accessary protein (IL-1RAcP) and activate IL-1 signaling pathway. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) initiates a wide spectrum of immunological responses to infection, stress, and tissue damage (19Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1 also functions as a costimulator to activate Th2 cells (20Hultner L. Kolsch S. Stassen M. Kaspers U. Kremer J.P. Mailhammer R. Moeller J. Broszeit H. Schmitt E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5556-5563Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21al-Ramadi B.K. Welte T. Fernandez-Cabezudo M.J. Galadari S. Dittel B. Fu X.Y. Bothwell A.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6827-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Binding of IL-1 to type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) leads to recruitment of membrane form of IL-1RAcP (mIL-1RAcP), which is essential for signal transduction (22Huang J. Gao X. Li S. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12829-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This is followed by recruitment of several intracellular adaptor proteins and kinases, including Toll-interacting protein (Tollip), MyD88, and members of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase family. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is also recruited transiently to the receptor complex and triggers signal events that culminate in the activation of IκB kinase complex and specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases. Activated IκB kinases phosphorylate the NF-κB inhibitor IκB, leading to the degradation of IκB and activation of NF-κB, whereas activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases phosphorylate and activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. IL-1 signal transduction ultimately leads to the activation of IL-1-responsive genes (19Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: re3Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that HBeAg interacts and colocalizes with mIL-1RAcP on the cell surface. Furthermore, HBeAg is able to induce the interaction of IL-1RI with mIL-1RAcP, trigger the recruitment of adaptor protein MyD88 to the IL-1RI/mIL-1RAcP complex, activate NF-κB through IκB-α degradation, induce NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression, and induce the expression of IL-1-responsive genes. Silencing IL-1RAcP dramatically abolishes HBeAg-mediated NF-κB activation. Our observations reveal an important function of HBeAg. The physiological significance of this interaction is discussed.

A total of 5 × 107 cfu was screened. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins and Bead-bound Proteins—Expression of the 19-kDa (His)6-HBeAg was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in bacterial strain Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Recombinant (His)6-HBeAg protein was purified under native condition on a nickel-agarose column and an anion exchanger column. The purification process was performed by fast protein liquid chromatography. The protein was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Fifty μg of purified (His)6-HBeAg in 500 μlof binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)) was incubated with 40 μl of nickel-charged His.Bind beads. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)). Recombinant GST fusion proteins, GST-2/5C, GST-Cd2/5C, and GST-HBeAg, were induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in bacterial strain RRI. Approximately 0.3 mg of GST fusion proteins in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was incubated with 40 μl of glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (50% slurry). The beads were washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. In Vitro Interaction—In vitro transcription and translation reactions were performed with TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's recommendation. In vitro transcription/translation products were incubated with glutathione bead-bound GST, GST-2/5C, and nickel bead-bound (His)6-HBeAg, respectively, in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 12.5 mm Mg2Cl, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The beads were then washed four times in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Bead-bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 102 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C at 8% CO2. Human hepatoma HA22T/VGH cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acid, 102 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C at 5% CO2. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into HEK293T cells or HA22T/VGH cells in a 10-cm dish by the calcium phosphate method. Each set of experiments was performed with two different preparations of plasmids and repeated two to three times for each preparation. Pulldown Assay—Cells in a 10-cm dish were lysed in 500 μlof 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5)) on ice for 20 min. Whole-cell extracts were incubated with 30 μl of glutathione-conjugated agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. Beads were washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once with wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5)). Immunoprecipitation—Cells in a 10-cm dish were lysed in 400 μl of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing Complete™ protein inhibitor mixture on ice for 2-3 h. Twenty μl of M2 affinity beads was added to the whole-cell extracts and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with rocking. Alternatively, 40 μl of anti-core antibody was added to the whole-cell extracts and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking. After adding 20 μl of protein A-agarose slurry, the mixtures were incubated for 3 h at 4°C with rocking. The M2 beads and anti-core protein A beads, respectively, were washed three times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Western Blot—Proteins were transferred to Hybond ECL or Hybond-P filter and detected by using primary antibody and secondary antibody. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Transfected HEK293T cells were precooled for 20 min at 4 °C and then incubated with HBeAg or IL-1β for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde and 1% sucrose for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS, blocked by incubation with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, and incubated with primary antibody in 3% BSA/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing with PBS, cells were incubated with anti-mouse IgG-TRITC conjugated and anti-rabbit IgG-FITC conjugated secondary antibodies and H33342 in 3% BSA/PBS for 45 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing with PBS, cells were examined by laser confocal microscopy. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts of HA22T/VGH cells were prepared as described previously (25Lai C.K. Ting L.P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed by incubating 10 μg of nuclear extracts with 1 × 105 cpm of [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled double-stranded wild type NF-κB oligonucleotides (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′) in 20 μl of binding buffer at 30 °C for 30 min as described previously (25Lai C.K. Ting L.P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For competition experiments, unlabeled wild type or mutant NF-κB oligonucleotides (5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) were added to the binding reaction on ice 5 min before addition of the radiolabeled probe. RNA Interference Technique—Fifty nm concentration of a 21-nucleotide siRNA duplex of IL-1RAcP gene (accession number NM_002182) at nt 254-272 (sense: 5′-GCAAAGUGAUGCCUCAGAAUU-3′; antisense: 5′-UUCUGAGGCAUCACUUUGCUU-3′) or control siRNA (siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA #2) in 12 μl of TransIT-TKO was transfected into HA22T/VGH cells in 6-cm dish for 72 h. Luciferase Reporter Assay—HA22T/VGH cells were cotransfected with plasmids containing NF-κB-driven firefly luciferase and TK-driven Renilla luciferase. Twenty-four h posttransfection, cells were treated with different reagents. To assay firefly and Renilla luciferase activities, cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer, and luciferase activities were determined by the manufacturer's standard protocols. Firefly luciferase activity values were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity values to control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was measured in duplicate wells, and experiments were repeated at least four times. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—The Ready-to-Go™ kit was used to measure the expression of IL-1 responsive genes and mIL-1RAcP mRNA in HA22T/VGH cells according to the manufacturer's recommendation. RT-PCR reactions containing total cellular RNA and primers were done in a single-tube format and a 50-μl reaction volume.

RT-PCR results were analyzed with a Personal Densitometer using ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). ELISA—HA22T/VGH cells were seeded in 24-well flat-bottom plates at 2 × 106 cells/ml and cultured for 2 days before stimulation. Cells were washed three times with PBS and stimulated with different reagents. Culture media were collected at 15 h for TNF-α and 24 h for GM-CSF, respectively, after stimulation. Levels of TNF-α and GM-CSF in the culture media were measured by ELISA. ELISA was performed by adding 50 μl of each sample to a 96-well plate of TNF-α and GM-CSF ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Each experiment was performed in triplicate wells and final results were the average of three independent experiments. In Vivo and in Vitro Interaction between HBeAg and IL-1RAcP—HBeAg shares a large stretch of sequence in common with HBV core protein, which assembles to form viral capsid. They only differ at the N and C termini (Fig. 1A). To identify the cellular protein(s) that interact with HBeAg and/or core protein, the C-terminal 67 amino acid-region from amino acid 119 to 185 of core protein (2/5C) was used as a bait to screen the human liver cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 1B, a ∼0.6-kb #46 cDNA was identified and confirmed to interact with the bait in yeast two-hybrid system. Sequence analysis of #46 shows it corresponds to amino acids 247-356 segment of the soluble form of human IL-1RAcP, sIL-1RAcP356. For human IL-1RAcP, one 570-amino acid membrane form (mIL-1RAcP) and two soluble forms, 356-amino acid form (sIL-1RAcP356) and 346-amino acid form (sIL-1RAcPβ) that are generated by alternative splicing have been identified (22Huang J. Gao X. Li S. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12829-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Jensen L.E. Muzio M. Mantovani A. Whitehead A.S. J.

Both soluble forms lack the intracellular and transmembrane domains of the membrane form. The sequence of mIL-1RAcP and sIL-1RAcP356 is identical from amino acid 1 to 350. The N-terminal segment of sIL-1RAcPβ, from amino acid 1 to 301, is identical to that of sIL-1RAcP356. A unique second half of the Ig3 domain makes up the rest of sIL-1RAcPβ. mIL-1RAcP is essential for IL-1-mediated response such as activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase, NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (19Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Huang J. Gao X. Li S. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12829-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 23Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: re3Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). sIL-1RAcP356 has been shown to act as an inhibitor of IL-1 signaling (26Jensen L.E. Muzio M. Mantovani A. Whitehead A.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5277-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Smith D.E. Hanna R. Della F. Moore H. Chen H. Farese A.M. MacVittie T.J. Virca G.D. Sims J.E. Immunity. 2003; 18: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The function of sIL-1RAcPβ is still unknown (27Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction between 2/5C and #46 protein in mammalian cells, GST or GST-tagged 2/5C (GST-2/5C) were coexpressed with HA-tagged #46 (HA-46) in HEK293T cells. Interaction between HA-46 and GST-2/5C, but not GST, was observed by glutathione-beads pull down followed by Western blot using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2A). In vitro 35S-labeled HA or HA-46 was incubated with bead-bound GST or GST-2/5C. HA-46 was pulled down by GST-2/5C, but not GST, demonstrating in vitro interaction between #46 and 2/5C proteins (Fig. 2B). To identify the minimal sequence that is required for the interaction with #46, GST-1/5C and GST-2/5Cd1/5C containing amino acids 144-185 and 116-149 of core, respectively, were coexpressed with HA-46 in HEK293T cells, only the latter could interact with HA-46 (Fig. 2A). Because this amino acids 116-149 segment is present in HBeAg, interaction between HBeAg and #46 protein was tested. Interaction of GST-HBeAg with HA-46 in HEK293T cells was observed (Fig. 2A). In vitro 35S-labeled HA-46, but not HA, was pulled down by (His)6-HBeAg (Fig. 2B). Therefore, HBeAg can interact with #46 protein in vivo and in vitro. Since the protein sequence encoded by #46 is present in sIL-1RAcP356, the interaction of sIL-1RAcP356 with different core mutants and HBeAg in HEK293T cells was investigated. Identical to the results in HA-46, the cytoplasmic HA-sIL-1RAcP protein was able to interact with GST-2/5C, GST-2/5Cd1/5C, and GST-HBeAg but not GST and GST-1/5C (Fig. 2A). Binding of HBeAg to mIL-1RAcP on the Cell Surface—HBeAg is a secreted protein produced during HBV replication, and present in the sera of the patients in natural infection. The above results raise the intriguing possibility that HBeAg in the sera of the patients may interact with the extracellular domain of a membrane-bound IL-1RAcP protein. To determine whether there is an interaction between endogenous mIL-1RAcP with HBeAg in vitro, crude HEK293T lysates were pre-cleared with glutathione bead-bound GST-Cd2/5C protein to remove proteins that could bind to GST or the portion of core protein not implicated in the interaction with IL-1RAcP. The precleared lysates were then incubated with glutathione bead-bound GST, GST-2/5C and GST-HBeAg, and nickel bead-bound (His)6-HBeAg, respectively. The endogenous mIL-1RAcP was pulled down by GST-2/5C, GST-HBeAg, and (His)6-HBeAg but not by GST (Fig. 2C). To further confirm whether the HBeAg can interact with mIL-1RAcP in vivo, purified (His)6-HBeAg was added into the culture medium of HEK293T cells, which was transiently transfected to overexpress the membrane FLAG:mIL-1RAcP protein, for 20 min. (His)6-HBeAg in lysates was immunoprecipitated with anti-core antibody and protein A-agarose beads. FLAG:mIL-1RAcP was coimmunoprecipitated with (His)6-HBeAg, suggesting the interaction between exogenous (His)6-HBeAg added to the culture medium and mIL-1RAcP on the cell surface (Fig. 2D). To further demonstrate that the binding of HBeAg to mIL-1RAcP indeed takes place on the cell surface, indirect immunofluorescence followed by confocal microscopy was performed on HEK293T cells transiently transfected to overexpress the membrane FLAG:mIL-1RAcP protein. As shown in Fig. 2E, binding of fluorescence labeled HBeAg to the cell surface of HEK293T cells was observed. The decoration of cell surface by HBeAg was only noted in HEK293T cells that also overexpressed FLAG: mIL-1RAcP. HBeAg binding intensity paralleled the level of expression of FLAG:mIL-1RAcP in the transfectants. Moreover, colocalization of HBeAg and FLAG:mIL-1RAcP in trans"

Here we used reverse transcription-PCR analyses, single cell Ca2+ imaging, and knock-out mice to define the receptors mediating nucleotide-induced Ca2+ signaling in resident peritoneal macrophages. In Ca2+-free buffer, the potent (K0.5 <1 μm) stimulatory effect of UTP (or ATP) on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release was abolished in cells isolated from P2Y2/P2Y4 double knock-out mice. Moreover,P2Y40/−, but notP2Y2−/−, macrophages responded to UTP. InP2Y2−/− macrophages, we could elicit Ca2+ responses to “pure” P2X receptor activation by applying ATP in buffer containing Ca2+. Purified UDP and ADP were ineffective agonists, although modest UDP-induced Ca2+ responses could be elicited in macrophages after “activation” with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ. Notably, in Ca2+-free buffer, UTP-induced Ca2+ transients decayed within 1 min, and there was no response to repeated agonist challenge. Measurements of ER [Ca2+] with mag-fluo-4 showed that ER Ca2+ stores were depleted under these conditions. When extracellular Ca2+ was available, ER Ca2+ stores refilled, but Ca2+ increased to only ∼40% of the initial value upon repeated UTP challenge. This apparent receptor desensitization persisted in GRK2+/- and GRK6-/- macrophages and after inhibition of candidate kinases protein kinase C and calmodulin-dependent kinase II. Initial challenge with UTP also reduced Ca2+ mobilization by complement component C5a (and vice versa). In conclusion, homologous receptor desensitization is not the major mechanism that rapidly dampens Ca2+ signaling mediated by P2Y2, the sole Gq-coupled receptor for UTP or ATP in macrophages.

UDP responsiveness (P2Y6 receptor expression) increases following macrophage activation. Antigen-presenting cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells express two families of nucleotide receptors as follows: ATP-gated cation channels (P2X receptors) and P2Y receptors, a subset of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (1Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In mouse, ATP and UTP are equipotent agonists at the Gq-coupled receptors P2Y2 and P2Y4, whereas human P2Y4 is selectively activated by UTP and competitively antagonized by ATP (2Herold C.L. Qi A.D. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11456-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, in human, ATP additionally activates the dual Gs- and Gq-coupled P2Y11 receptor, absent in the mouse genome (3Communi D. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The concentration of ATP or UTP in the local extracellular milieu is estimated to be around 10 nm (4Lazarowski E.R.

However, mechanical stress, cellular injury, inflammation, degranulation of mast cells, and other factors may increase ATP and UTP to levels sufficient to evoke larger and longer lasting global Ca2+ signals (5Lazarowski E.R.

ATP is also released as a cotransmitter from the sympathetic nervous system, a potentially important neuroimmune interaction (9Haskó G. Szabó C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Westfall D.P. Todorov L.D. Mihaylova-Todorova S.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Local increases in ATP or UTP levels are transient because of both diffusion and the activity of ecto-nucleotidases such as CD39 (NTPDase 1), which catalyzes the sequential hydrolysis of ATP and UTP to their respective monophosphates (8Lazarowski E.R.

In particular, P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors are preferentially activated by ADP and play important roles in platelet function (12Gachet C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 46: 277-300Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). UTP degradation by CD39 yields transiently the intermediate UDP, which is a specific agonist for P2Y6 receptors (13Lazarowski E.R. Rochelle L.G. O'Neal W.K. Ribeiro C.M.P. Zhang V. Grubb B.R. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 43-49PubMed Google Scholar). During prolonged agonist stimulation, the response of P2Y and P2X receptors is typically switched off within minutes (14Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37651-37657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15North R.A. Physiol.

Blood. 2005; 105: 3552-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the case of G protein-coupled receptors, the activity of the activated G protein is terminated by GTPase-activating proteins, which catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP bound to the α-subunit (17Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced “desensitization” is thought to involve phosphorylation of the C terminus (or intracellular loops) by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) or second messenger-induced protein kinase C (PKC). Phosphorylation by GRK promotes the rapid binding of β-arrestin, which blocks further G protein activation (18Krasel C. Bünemann M. Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9528-9535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 19Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of specific agonists and antagonists, it is difficult to assign unequivocally P2Y and P2X receptor subtypes to a particular cell type. In this study, by using P2Y2- and/or P2Y4-deficient mice, as well as RT-PCR analyses, we show that P2Y2 is the dominant receptor in resident peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, we dissected the interplay of P2Y2 receptors, P2X receptors, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels, and Ca2+-ATPases (Ca2+ pumps) in nucleotide-induced Ca2+ signaling. Finally, we assessed the role of PKC, calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), GRK2, and GRK6 in the rapid desensitization of P2Y2 receptors using inhibitors and GRK-deficient mice. Knock-out (KO) Mice—P2Y2−/−,P2Y40/−, and P2Y2/P2Y4 double KO mice were generated as described recently (20Matos J.E. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.M. Leipziger J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 564: 269-279Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Heterozygous P2Y2 mice originally were kindly donated by Dr. Beverly H. Koller (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), and the inactivation of the P2Y4 gene, which is located on the X chromosome, has been described previously (21Robaye B. Ghanem E. Wilkin F. Fokan D. van Driessche W. Schurmans S. Boeynaems J.M. Beauwens R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GRK2+/- mice were kindly provided by Dr. Marc G. Caron (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC), and GRK6-deficient mice were generously provided by Dr. Richard T. Premont and Dr. Robert J. Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center). The genetic backgrounds of the male littermate wild-type (WT) and KO mice used in this study were as follows:P2Y2−/− (mixed B6D2 × CD-1 × SV129);P2Y40/− (mixed CD-1 × SV129); P2Y2/P2Y4 double KO (mixed B6D2 × CD-1 × SV129); GRK2+/- (C57BL/6); and GRK6-/- (C57BL/6). Heterozygous GRK2 mice were used because homozygous mutations are embryonically lethal. Isolation of Peritoneal Macrophages—Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and resident peritoneal cells were harvested by lavage with 10 ml of ice-cold Hanks' physiological salt solution. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in RPMI medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and incubated at 37 °C in air with 5% CO2. After 2 h, nonadherent cells were removed by washing the coverslip. In selected experiments, macrophages were activated by incubation for >24 h in RPMI medium (with 10% calf serum) containing 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide and 100 units/ml interferon-γ. Flow Cytometry—B220-CD11b+ cells (macrophages) were purified by depletion of B220+ cells (B lymphocytes), followed by positive selection for CD11b+ cells (supplemental Fig. 1) using a magnetic cell sorting system (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Note that B1 cells are the major subpopulation of B lymphocytes in the peritoneal cavity and weakly express CD11b (22Montecino-Rodriguez E. Leathers H. Dorshkind K. Nat. Immun. 2006; 7: 293-301Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Aliquots before and after purification were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-B220 (clone RA3-6B2; Pharmingen), allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD11b (clone M1/70; Pharmingen), and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (clone CI:A3-1; Serotec, Düsseldorf, Germany) against the macrophage marker F4/80. Phenotypical analysis was performed by flow cytometry using a FACS Canto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). RT-PCR Analyses—Total cellular RNA was prepared using a HighPure RNA extraction kit (Roche Applied Science), which included DNase I digestion. After reverse transcription (RT) with a cDNA synthesis kit (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) using oligo(dT)18, PCR analysis was performed using primers (shown in supplemental Table 1) specific for mouse P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y6; P2X1, P2X2, P2X3, P2X4, P2X5, and P2X7; GRK2, GRK3, GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6. PCR products were confirmed by sequencing, and where necessary, cDNA prepared from total mouse brain or heart RNA (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) was used as positive control. Fluorescence Microscopy—Differential interference contrast and fluorescence images of live peritoneal macrophages, typically 12-14 μm diameter, were acquired using an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with a software-controlled Sensi-CamQE CCD camera (Chromaphor, Duisburg, Germany). Cells were labeled with the fluorescent nucleic acid stain Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) and imaged using a ×100 (1.4 numerical aperture) objective lens and immersion oil. Cytosolic [Ca2+] Measurements—A glass coverslip seeded with macrophages was sealed onto the bottom of a Perspex bath (volume, 100 μl) mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot 300). Cells were imaged via a ×40 (1.4 numerical aperture) oil-immersion objective and superfused at 1 ml/min with modified Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 136 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm NaH2PO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm HEPES, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm probenecid, and5.5 mm d-glucose (pH 7.4). Ca2+-free buffer solution was prepared by omitting CaCl2 and adding 0.5 mm EGTA. Solutions were rapidly switched by means of miniature three-way valves (The Lee Co., Westbrook, CT). To monitor cytosolic [Ca2+], cells were incubated for 15 min with 10 μm fluo-3/AM (Molecular Probes). Endoplasmic Reticulum [Ca2+] Measurements—To measure ER [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]ER), the low affinity fluorescent Ca2+ indicator mag-fluo-4 was selectively loaded into the ER. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5 μm mag-fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes), washed several times, and incubated overnight at 4 °C before use. Probenecid was omitted from the Hanks' buffered solution to promote leak of cytosolic mag-fluo-4. Fluo-3 or mag-fluo-4 loaded macrophages were excited at 488 nm via a monochromator, whereas fluorescence was detected at 530 ± 15 nm. Only one cell per coverslip was used for experiments, and moreover, only the first response to a given nucleotide concentration was used to establish concentration-response relations. The fluorescence signals were normalized with respect to the resting fluorescence intensity (F0) and expressed as F/F0. Materials—Chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Solutions of UDP or ADP were purified from contaminating nucleotide triphosphates by incubation with 50 units/ml hexokinase and 20 mm glucose for at least 2 h at room temperature. Recombinant mouse interferon-γ was obtained from PeproTech (London, UK), and recombinant mouse complement component C5a was purchased from R & D Systems (Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). P2Y Receptor Signaling—To determine the effects of extracellular nucleotides on ER Ca2+ release in macrophages, Ca2+-free buffer was used to obviate the potentially confounding effects of store-operated Ca2+ entry and Ca2+ influx via P2X receptors. When single WT macrophages were superfused with UTP in Ca2+-free buffer, a concentration-dependent increase in peak cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) was evoked (Fig. 1A); UTP increased peak [Ca2+]i with a K0.5 value of 0.7 μm. Activation of either P2Y2 or P2Y4 receptors could be responsible for the transient Ca2+ response to UTP in Ca2+-free buffer. Both of these receptor subtypes have recently been reported to be expressed in mouse macrophages (23Coutinho-Silva R. Ojcius D.M. Górecki D.C. Persechini P.M. Bisaggio R.C. Mendes A.N. Marks J. Burnstock G. Dunn P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To explore the relative roles of P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors, we first challenged macrophages isolated from P2Y2 and P2Y4 knock-out mice with UTP. Concentrations of UTP between 0.1 and 100 μm, or as high as 250 μm (n = 7; not shown), had no effect on [Ca2+]i in macrophages isolated from P2Y2/P2Y4 double knock-out mice (Fig. 1B), indicating that P2Y2 or P2Y4 are the only possible Gq-coupled receptors mediating UTP-induced Ca2+ signaling. P2Y2/P2Y4 double knock-out mice exhibited no obvious phenotype (20Matos J.E. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.M. Leipziger J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 564: 269-279Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and macrophages isolated from these animals were indistinguishable from WT cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, similar to WT cells, macrophages isolated from double knock-out mice expressed mRNA specific for P2Y1 and P2Y6 (Fig. 2C), and P2Y2, but not P2Y4, could be detected in WT cells. Mouse whole brain RNA was used as positive control for the P2Y4-specific primer (not shown). Both WT and double knockout macrophages expressed several ATP-gated, nonselective cation channels as follows: P2X1, P2X4, and P2X7 receptors (Fig. 2D). The upper band in the P2X4 lanes was not identified. To assess the relative contributions of P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors, we compared the effects of UTP on Ca2+ signaling in macrophages isolated fromP2Y2−/− orP2Y40/− mice. Similar to WT cells, application of 10 μm UTP (in Ca2+-free buffer) elicited a transient and oscillatory increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in macrophages isolated fromP2Y40/− mice, as shown in Fig. 3A. However, as illustrated by the example in Fig. 3B, macrophages isolated from P2Y2-deficient mice did not respond to UTP, but these cells responded to ATP, provided that Ca2+ was present in the buffer (Fig. 3B). The concentration-response relations for macrophages isolated fromP2Y40/− andP2Y2−/− mice are presented in Fig. 3, C and D. Thus, consistent with the RT-PCR data, the concentration-response data reveal that P2Y2 is the sole Gq-coupled receptor for UTP in resident macrophages. UTP is sequentially degraded to UDP and UMP extracellularly, a reaction catalyzed by the surface membrane enzyme CD39. Because we detected mRNA for P2Y6 in both WT and double knock-out macrophages, we expected to observe ER Ca2+ release induced by UDP. In preliminary experiments, 100 μm UDP (97% pure by high performance liquid chromatography) consistently induced ER Ca2+ release. However, after contaminating UTP (or ATP) was scavenged with hexokinase (24Harden T.K. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 43-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 10 of 11 WT macrophages did not respond at all to 100 μm UDP, whereas all cells responded to ATP, used as positive control (Fig. 4A). Note that when extracellular Ca2+ was reintroduced after stimulating cells with high ATP (or UTP; not shown) concentrations in Ca2+-free buffer, an increase in intracellular Ca2+, consistent with store-operated Ca2+ entry (25Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), was always observed (Fig. 4A). Moreover, similar to WT, 12 of 17 P2Y2/P2Y4-deficient macrophages did not respond to 100 μm UDP, and the response in the remaining five cells was characterized by a small, single Ca2+ transient (Fig. 4B). Taken together, the [UDP]-response relations for macrophages from both WT and P2Y2/P2Y4 double knock-out mice were essentially flat in the 1-100 μm range (Fig. 4C). These data reveal that, functionally, P2Y6 is weakly expressed in resident macrophages. However, when P2Y2/P2Y4-deficient macrophages were activated for 48-72 h with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ, responsiveness increased, such that most cells (9 of 11) produced a small oscillatory Ca2+ response to 100 μm UDP (peak F/F0 3.0 ± 0.2; not shown). To explore the potential role of P2Y1 receptors, we challenged macrophages with ADP under Ca2+-free conditions. Application of 100 μm ADP (purified with hexokinase) had no effect on [Ca2+]i in 9 of 11 WT cells, whereas ATP produced a strong positive control response (Fig. 5A). Concentration-response relations for ADP and ATP in WT macrophages are overlaid in Fig. 5B. Similar to WT, ADP also had little or no effect in macrophages isolated from P2Y2/P2Y4 double knock-out mice, and no response to ATP was observed (Fig. 5C). P2X Receptor Signaling—Although we could not elicit a Ca2+ response to UTP in macrophages isolated from P2Y2-deficient (P2Y2−/− or double knock-out) mice, we could observe a small transient response to ATP provided that Ca2+ was present in the buffer (Fig. 6). Thus, targeted disruption of the P2Y2 gene reveals the Ca2+ response to pure P2X receptor activation. The Ca2+ response elicited by ATP was small and diminished upon repeated application of agonist (Fig. 6, A and B). The concentration-response relation in the 0.1-250 μm ATP range is shown in Fig. 6C (data fromP2Y2−/− and double knock-out mice were combined). Note that in RT-PCR analyses we could detect P2X1, P2X4, and P2X7 in macrophages isolated from both WT and P2Y2/P2Y4 double knock-out mice (see Fig. 2D). For comparison, the pure P2Y receptor response to ATP is overlaid in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the P2Y receptor-induced Ca2+ response greatly dominates over the P2X receptor response in the 0.1-10 μm ATP range. GRK6 Is Not Essential for Rapid Desensitization of P2Y2 Receptors—When extracellular Ca2+ was available, application of 100 μm UTP typically produced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i followed by fast and slow components of decline (Fig. 7A), the latter of which was absent in Ca2+-free buffer (for example, see Fig. 4A) and can be attributed to store-operated Ca2+ entry. Furthermore, the Ca2+ response to repeated UTP challenge was greatly diminished (Fig. 7A), suggesting that the initial challenge may have desensitized the receptor. GRKs have been implicated in the desensitization mechanism of various G protein-coupled receptors, and to test whether GRK6 is involved in the rapid desensitization of P2Y2 receptors, we isolated macrophages from GRK6-/- mice. Compared with WT cells, there was no enhancement of the second UTP-induced Ca2+ response in GRK6-deficient macrophages, even when cells were pretreated with inhibitors of the candidate regulatory kinases PKC (staurosporine) and CaMKII (KN93) (Fig. 7B). RT-PCR analyses of RNA extracted from purified macrophages indicated that GRK2 and GRK5 were also expressed, but only weak signals for GRK3 and GRK4 were detected (Fig. 7C). We also found that apparent desensitization, assayed by repeated challenges with 100 μm UTP, was not reduced in macrophages isolated from GRK2+/- mice, which express 50% protein compared with WT (26Vroon A. Kavelaars A. Limmroth V. Lombardi M.S. Goebel M.U. van Dam A.M. Caron M.G. Schedlowski M. Heijnen C.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4400-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, the experiments with WT, GRK2+/-, and GRK6-/- macrophages summarized in Fig. 7D (see also supplemental Fig. 2) suggest that the kinases GRK2, GRK6, PKC, and CaMKII are not necessary for the rapid dampening of P2Y2 receptor signaling in macrophages. Stimulation of P2Y2 Receptors Decreases the Subsequent Response to a Non-P2Y Gq-coupled Receptor—If the decreased Ca2+ response to repeated UTP application is because of homologous P2Y2 receptor desensitization, then the response to a non-P2Y Gq-coupled receptor should be unaffected following initial UTP challenge. To test this possibility, we used complement factor C5a as a second agonist, the receptor of which has been shown using WT versusGq/15−/− mice to be coupled toGq/15 (27Davignon I. Catalina M.D. Smith D. Montgomery J. Swantek J. Siegelman M. Croy J. Wilkie T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas P2Y receptors are coupled to Gq/11. When a macrophage was first challenged with 100 μm UTP followed by 100 nm C5a, the second Ca2+ response was decreased (Fig. 8A) and vice versa (Fig. 8B), indicating that heterologous mechanisms, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate depletion, are contributing to the decayed Ca2+ responses to repeated UTP challenges. On average, the peak of the second Ca2+ response was ∼40% of the initial response when UTP was applied twice, whereas the second response was ∼60% (relative to the first response) when different agonists were used (Fig. 8C). Another potentially important factor determining the magnitude of the second agonist-induced Ca2+ response is the availability of ER Ca2+. Indeed, there was no response at all to repeated UTP challenge when experiments were performed in Ca2+-free buffer (Fig. 8C), an unphysiological condition that promotes Ca2+ extrusion via the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (Ca2+ pump). Contribution of ER Ca2+ Depletion to Apparent P2Y2 Receptor Desensitization—Mag-fluo-4 was selectively loaded into the ER lumen to measure [Ca2+]ER. When 100 μm UTP was applied to macrophages, a decrease in [Ca2+]ER was observed (Fig. 9A), which on average recovered 77.3 ± 4.5% (n = 6). Compared with fluo-3, mag-fluo-4 was much more susceptible to photobleaching, and thus the extent of recovery was probably underestimated in these experiments. In Ca2+-free buffer, the recovery of [Ca2+]ER after transient application of UTP was less than 15% (n = 5), as shown in Fig. 9B. However, the ER lumen was rapidly refilled with Ca2+ after switching to buffer containing1.3 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 9B). Calcium is an important regulatory ion inside cells, and in immune cells it has been implicated in diverse functions, including cytoskeleton reorganization, gene expression, and the gating of various K+ channels (28Marteau F. Communi D. Boeynaems J.M. Suarez-Gonzalez N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 796-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Hanley P.J. Musset B. Renigunta V. Limberg S.H. Dalpke A.H. Heeg K.M.

Immun. 2006; 7: 25-32Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Here we have identified the subtypes of P2Y and P2X receptors involved in transducing changes in extracellular nucleotide levels to transient Ca2+ signaling in macrophages. We found that UTP- and ATP-induced Ca2+ transients were abolished in macrophages isolated from P2Y2/P2Y4 double knock-out orP2Y2−/− mice but were unaffected by genetic ablation of P2Y4. This conclusion was supported by RT-PCR analyses that showed that P2Y2, but not P2Y4, receptors were expressed in purified macrophages. Thus, in resident peritoneal macrophages, P2Y2 is the only G protein-coupled receptor linking extracellular UTP and ATP to phospholipase C-β, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, releasing the second messengers IP3 and diacylglycerol, an activator of PKC. Transient elevation of IP3 promotes the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum by increasing the open probability of IP3 receptors(32Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 177: 435-446Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, cytosolic [Ca2+] regulates the various IP3 receptor subtypes in a bell-shaped fashion (inhibition at higher concentrations), a gating property that may facilitate the oscillatory Ca2+ release pattern we observed at submaximal P2Y receptor agonist concentrations. In P2Y2-deficient macrophages, ATP-induced Ca2+ mobilization was abolished in strictly Ca2+-free conditions. This lack of responsiveness to ATP underscores that there is no equivalent to the human P2Y11 receptor in mouse macrophages. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, a small Ca2+ transient induced by ATP is observed and most likely represents the pure P2X receptor response to this agonist. We found that mouse macrophages express P2X1, P2X4, and P2X7 mRNA, which seems to be a common pattern of expression for macrophages from various species (23Coutinho-Silva R. Ojcius D.M. Górecki D.C.

North R.A. Surprenant A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). P2X7 receptors do not form heteromeric receptors with other P2X subunits, but heteromeric P2X1/P2X4 receptor assembly has been described recently in an oocyte expression system (34Nicke A. Kerschensteiner D. Soto F. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 925-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Whether heteromeric P2X1/P2X4 receptors, or even P2Y receptor heteromerization (35Yoshioka K. Saitoh O. Nakata H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7617-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), play a functional role in native cells remains to be established. At this stage, we assume that homomeric P2X4 receptors are the major contributors to Ca2+ influx in the concentration range we tested (0.1-250 μm) because the P2X1 receptor response has been reported to terminate within 1 s, and the P2X7 receptor is much less sensitive to ATP (15North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, P2X receptor signaling is not only switched off by receptor desensitization, which we could observe in superfused cells, but also by rapid degradation of ATP by ecto-nucleotidases. ADP is the preferential agonist for the Gq-coupled P2Y1 receptor, and RT-PCR analyses showed that this P2Y receptor subtype is expressed in mouse macrophages along with P2Y2.In peritoneal macrophages isolated from BALB/c mice, this agonist has been reported to have no effect on [Ca2+]i at 10 μm but to have a modest effect (possibly overestimated because of contaminating ATP) at 100 μm (23Coutinho-Silva R. Ojcius D.M. Górecki D.C. Persechini P.M. Bisaggio R.C. Mendes A.N. Marks J. Burnstock G. Dunn P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We also observed that ADP (purified with hexokinase) had negligible effect in macrophages isolated from WT or P2Y2-deficient mice. We additionally detected P2Y6 receptors in RT-PCR analyses; however, UDP-induced Ca2+ release was scant in resident macrophages isolated from either P2Y2/P2Y4 double knock-out or WT mice. A modest response to UDP, though, was observed after macrophages had been activated with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ, suggesting that, functionally, P2Y6 receptors are weakly expressed in resting macrophages but, following activation by stimuli such as Toll-like receptor ligands, P2Y6 gene expression is switched on, increasing the scope of uridine nucleotide-induced signaling. Signal transduction by G protein-coupled receptors, including P2Y receptors, is tightly controlled by mechanisms that dampen signal transmission. The rapid termination of P2Y2 receptor-induced Ca2+ signaling and refractoriness to repeated agonist challenge we observed could, in principle, be due to several mechanisms. The activated Gq/11 subunit may be inhibited by GTPase-activating proteins, such as members of the regulators of G protein signaling family (17Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 36Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and direct receptor phosphorylation by PKC or GRKs (promoting the recruitment of β-arrestin) may uncouple the receptor. Our data obtained using GRK2+/- and GRK6-/- mice, as well as pharmacological inhibition of PKC, suggest that GRK6, PKC, or normal levels of GRK2 are not essential for switching off Ca2+ signaling induced by P2Y2 receptor activation. Consistent with our observations, González and co-workers (37Otero M. Garrad R.C. Velázquez B. Hernández-Pérez M.G. Erb L. Camden J.M. Clarke L.L. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. González,F. A. Mol.

Biochem. 2005; 280: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) deduced that PKC was not responsible for agonist-induced P2Y2 receptor desensitization, but they provided evidence that receptor phosphorylation by an unidentified kinase was involved. We also found that inhibition of CaMKII did not prevent apparent P2Y2 receptor desensitization. Similarly, Tulapurkar et al. (39Tulapurkar M.E. Zündorf G. Reiser G. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 624-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported that inhibition of CaMKII did not affect desensitization of P2Y1 receptors, but it blocked internalization of activated receptors. Local depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (the source of IP3), which has been nicely shown in myocytes to have low mobility in the surface membrane (40Cho H. Kim Y.A. Yoon J.-Y. Lee D. Kim J.H. Lee S.H. Ho W.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15241-15246Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), could contribute to switching off signal transmission by activated Gq-coupled receptors. This could explain why the Ca2+ response is greater when the second agonist is C5a instead of UTP after initial challenge with UTP, i.e. the C5a receptor has access to a spatially distinct lipid pool. Downstream of IP3 generation, ER Ca2+ stores may become depleted, intraluminal Ca2+ cycling may be rate-limiting, or the IP3 receptor may be rendered rectractory. ER [Ca2+] measurements suggest that Ca2+ stores are rapidly replenished following P2Y2 receptor stimulation, but under certain conditions favoring plasma membrane Ca2+ transport systems (Ca2+-free buffer) ER stores are depleted, and there is no response to repeated agonist challenge. Thus, the interplay of Ca2+ transport systems is an important determinant of Gq-coupled receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling. In conclusion, we can summarize the main findings of this study in the schematic diagram shown in Fig. 10. Various stimuli such as mechanical stress, cell injury, or inflammation release UTP and ATP into the extracellular space. Macrophages sense the increased nucleotide levels through the dominant Gq-coupled P2Y2 receptor that is activated by UTP = ATP but insensitive to UDP and ADP. ATP additionally induces Ca2+ influx via P2X receptors, and UDP activates the P2Y6 receptor, functionally expressed in activated macrophages. Downstream of the activated Gq-coupled receptors, IP3 is generated and releases Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. At the same time, the recently identified Ca2+-release sensor STIM1 probably translocates to the surface membrane (Fig. 10, dashed arrow) and activates Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels to promote Ca2+ entry and refilling of stores (25Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Two Ca2+-ATPases compete to clear Ca2+ from the cytosol as follows: the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase. Conditions favoring plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity will lead to diminished ER refilling. Download .pdf (.11 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2136954378,"The ryanodine receptor has been mainly regarded as the Ca2+ release channel from sarcoplasmic reticulum controlling skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction. However, many studies have shown that it is widely expressed, with functions not restricted to muscular contraction. This study examined whether ryanodine receptor plays a role in calcium signaling in the liver. RT-PCR analysis of isolated hepatocytes showed expression of a truncated type 1 ryanodine receptor, but no type 2 or type 3 message was detected. We also detected binding sites for [3H]ryanodine in the microsomal cellular fraction and in permeabilized hepatocytes. This binding was displaced by caffeine and dantrolene, but not by ruthenium red, heparin or cyclic ADP-Ribose. Ryanodine, by itself, did not trigger Ca2+ oscillations in either primary cultured hepatocytes or hepatocytes within the intact perfused rat liver. In both preparations, however, ryanodine significantly increased the frequency of the cytosolic free [Ca2+] oscillations evoked by an α1 adrenergic receptor agonist. Experiments in permeabilized hepatocytes showed that both ryanodine and cyclic ADP-ribose evoked a slow Ca2+ leak from intracellular stores and were able to increase the Ca2+-released response to a subthreshold dose of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Our findings suggest the presence of a novel truncated form of the type 1 ryanodine receptor in rat hepatocytes. Ryanodine modulates the pattern of cytosolic free [Ca2+] oscillations by increasing oscillation frequency.

We propose that the Ca2+ released from ryanodine receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum provides an increased pool of Ca2+ for positive feedback on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. Two families of channels lead to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RyR, ryanodine receptor; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; [Ca2+]c, cytosolic free [Ca2+]; cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+-released; SMB, sucrose-MOPS-benzamidine; CP, creatine phosphate; CPK, creatine phosphokinase; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; BSP, bromosulfophthalein; ECM, extracellular medium; CCD, charge-coupled device; 8-Br-cADPR, 8-bromo-cADPR; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. /sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). One is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) family. Three different isoforms (types I, II, III) have been characterized and there are also a number of splicing variants. Activation of the IP3Rs is elicited by IP3 generated by receptor activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC). The IP3Rs are predominantly situated in the ER and play a pivotal role in Ca2+ signaling in almost every cell type (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar, 2Joseph S.K. Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The second family of intracellular Ca2+ channels has been named ryanodine receptor (RyR) because of its high affinity for the plant alkaloid ryanodine that led to its identification and purification (3Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ryanodine has been utilized as a tool to study Ca2+ release from the ER/SR of, at first, muscle cells, and more recently of a wide variety of nonmuscle cells. As with the IP3R family, the RyR family consists of three isoforms: RyR1 is commonly associated with skeletal muscle cells, RyR2 with cardiac muscle cells and RyR3 is widely distributed with low expression and unclear physiological role (4Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of both channel families is their regulation by Ca2+ itself. Ca2+ can either stimulate or inhibit the channels depending on its concentration. The stimulatory process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+-released (CICR) plays a very important role because it is a regenerative mechanism that amplifies the Ca2+ signal and propagates it throughout the cytoplasm (5Galione A. McDougall A. Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M. Science. 1993; 261: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 6Wang S.Q. Song L.S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Nature. 2001; 410: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the last few years it has also become clear that cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) can induce the opening of RyRs (7Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B. Science. 1991; 253: 1143-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes are polarized epithelial cells where Ca2+ signaling plays an essential role in the control of metabolism and function. Hormones, such as vasopressin, angiotensin II, and α-adrenergic agonists, mobilize internal Ca2+ stores by stimulating the production of the second messenger IP3. At submaximal hormone concentration, these responses manifest as a series of periodic cytosolic free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c) spikes (8Woods N.M. Cuthbertson K.S. Cobbold P.H. Nature. 1986; 319: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The amplitude and rate of rise of each [Ca2+]c spike is relatively constant, whereas the frequency of [Ca2+]c spikes increases with agonist concentration (9Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17131-17141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This frequency-modulated temporal organization has been suggested to be important in the modulation of many cellular processes, such as mitochondrial metabolism (10Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), glycogen breakdown (11Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F.D. Blackmore P.F. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). The RyR has not been identified nor fully characterized in hepatocytes. On one hand there is evidence for [3H]ryanodine binding to microsomal fractions (13Shoshan-Barmatz V. Pressley T.A. Higham S. Kraus-Friedmann N. Biochem.

In the present study, we demonstrate by RT-PCR analysis the presence of a truncated type 1 RyR in rat hepatocytes. According to our results in permeabilized and intact cells, RyRs are important in amplifying the IP3-induced Ca2+ response. We propose that RyRs play an active role in the Ca2+ signaling of hepatocytes, creating local Ca2+ microdomains that enhance the responsiveness of neighboring IP3Rs through Ca2+-positive feedback. Primary Hepatocyte Isolation—Fed, male anesthetized rats (Sprague-Dawley; 200–250 g) were used for preparation of isolated hepatocytes by collagenase perfusion of intact liver as described previously (9Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17131-17141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For studies with freshly isolated hepatocytes, the cells were stored on ice prior to use. For overnight culture, hepatocytes (7 × 105) were plated on collagen-coated glass coverslips in 3 ml of William E medium (WEM) supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 140 nm insulin. After 2–3 h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed into the same medium with insulin reduced to 14 nm and maintained in culture overnight. The next day, the cells were washed again and incubated at least 60 min without insulin prior to use. Detection of RyR mRNA by RT-PCR—Rat hepatocytes were isolated as described above and the total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc.) and reverse-transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen). PCR amplification (Advantage cDNA PCR Kit, BD Biosciences) was used to amplify RyR cDNA. We used the 11 sets of primers shown in Table 1. (Consensus primers, primers for RyR2, RyR3, and primers h-RyR1 were selected from Fitzsimmons et al. (20Fitzsimmons T.J. Gukovsky I. McRoberts J.A. Rodriguez E. Lai F.A. Pandol S.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and modified according to rat sequences of GenBank™ accession numbers XM_001078539, XM_008338, and XM_001080527. Primers a-RyR1 were selected from Lee et al. (21Lee B.S. Sessanna S. Laychock S.G. Rubin R.P. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 189: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Primers b-, c-, d-, e-, f-, g-RyR1 were designed using the program Primer3). The amplification conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, and the respective annealing temperatures reported in Table 1 for 30 s and 68 °C for 10 s/100 bp, for 35–55 cycles. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels or 10% TBE Gel (Invitrogen) and visualized by DNA staining with ethidium bromide. We obtained the same results from two different mRNA extractions from two different livers. The bands resulting from amplification with h-RyR1 primers and e-RyR1 were extracted and purified using gel-extracting kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using ABI BigDye Terminator chemistry on an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. As a control, we performed a reaction with the total hepatic RNA in the absence of reverse transcriptase.TABLE 1Primers used to amplify mRNA for ryanodine receptor subtypes and regions of RyR1mRNAForward primerReverse primerExpected product sizeAnnealing TBp°CRyR consensusAACTACTGGGACAAITTIGTCCIATICCACAGATGAAGCA74156RyR2GAATCAGCGAGTTACTGGGCATGGTTGGTCTCTGAGTTCTCCAAAAGC63560RyR3CCTTCGCTATCAACTTCATCCTGCTCTTCTACTGGGCTAAAGTCCAGG50560a-RyR1TCTGATTGAGAGTCCTGAGGTGCATCACCTCGAAGTACCACTTG30158b-RyR1GTTCGCCATCAACATGCAACTCCTGACCCGCGAAGAC65861c-RyR1GCCCAGGAGGACTTCGTTAGGCCAATGCCACTGTTC47964d-RyR1GCTCCTTACCAACCACTACGACCGGGACAACGTAACCAC68263e-RyR1CAACCAATACTTCACCAACCACCAGACCCGCCTTTACGAT25965f-RyR1TTTCGAGGACCGCATGATAGAAGCCCACTTCCTTCTTGT48760g-RyR1CAGGACTACGTCACCGATCCAAGCTCACGAACAGCTCCA47962h-RyR1GAAGGTTCTGGACAAACACGGGTCGCTCTTGTTGTAGAACTTGCGG43560 Open table in a new tab Liver Microsome Preparation—Liver microsomes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats, as described previously (22Taraschi T.F. Wu A. Rubin E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7096-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Ellingson J.S. Janes N. Taraschi T.F. Rubin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1062: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Livers were quickly excised and placed in beakers containing ice-cold sucrose-MOPS-benzamidine buffer (SMB; 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the following protease inhibitors: 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin and 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.0). The livers were weighed, suspended in 5 volumes of ice-cold SMB and then homogenized using 5 up and down strokes of the Dounce homogenizer. The resultant homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min and 15,000 × g for 15 min (4 °C). The supernatant obtained was centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 45 min (4 °C). The microsomal pellets were homogeneously suspended into 10 ml of ice-cold SMB buffer. The protein concentration of the microsomes was determined using the biuret method. [3H]Ryanodine Binding—Digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes (2 mg/ml protein) or liver microsomes (1 mg/ml protein) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in Mg2+-free intracellular buffer (20 mm Hepes/Tris, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, and 10 mm NaCl) containing 100 μm Ca2+, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate (CP), 0.5 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (CPK), 1 μg/ml each of the following protease inhibitors, pepstatin, leupeptin and antipain, and the mitochondrial uncouplers, 5 μg/ml oligomycin, 1 μg/ml rotenone, and 5 μg/ml carbonyl cyanide m-chloro phenyl hydrazone (CCCP). Permeabilized cells or liver microsomes were then incubated an additional 20 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of [3H]ryanodine (0.05–48 nm). The unbound [3H]ryanodine was separated from protein-bound [3H]ryanodine by vacuum filtration. All samples were filtered through 0.22-μm pore size Millipore filters and rapidly washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer containing 150 mm KCl and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Radioactivity retained on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of [3H]ryanodine bound in the presence of unlabeled ryanodine (100 μm). Specific binding represents the differences between total binding ([3H]ryanodine alone) and nonspecific binding ([3H]ryanodine plus 100 μm unlabeled ryanodine). In parallel experiments, liver microsomes (1 mg/ml protein) were incubated for 20 min with a submaximal concentration of [3H]ryanodine (9 nm) together with unlabeled ryanodine (100 μm) or various known pharmacological modulators of the RyRs. Where indicated, ruthenium red (100 μm), caffeine (5 mm), dantrolene (100 μm), heparin (100 μg/ml) or cADPR (2 μm) were also included in the incubation period followed by vacuum filtration. Microinjection of Hepatocytes—For microinjection in intact hepatocytes, the cells were plated in WEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine at 105 cells/ml for 1 h at 37°C in an incubator. Then the plated cells were incubated with 5 μm Indo1/AM for 45 min in the presence of sulfinpyrazone (300 μm). Measurements were performed in the Na+ Hepes buffer containing 2 mm Ca2+. Indo1 fluorescence was acquired with a dichroic bean splitter and a pair of photomultipliers to collect fluorescence simultaneously at 410 nm and 480 nm. The data are presented as the ratio of 410/480 nm fluorescence. The pipettes used to microinject were made with glass from WPI type 1BBL with filament (ref 1B150F-4) diameter 1.5 mm. After touching the cell with the pipette, the different compounds were injected with a pressure of 20 PSI for 40 s using a Picospritzer. Imaging Measurements in Intact and Permeabilized Hepatocytes—For Ca2+ measurements in intact hepatocytes, the cells where incubated with 5 μm fura2/AM for 15–25 min in the presence of 100 μm bromosulfophthalein (BSP) and 0.02% of pluronic acid. For Mn2+ quenching experiments of compartmentalized fura2, the cells were loaded with fura2/AM for 60 min. The indicator was loaded by incubating the hepatocytes in extracellular medium (ECM) composed of 25 mm HEPES, 121 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Measurements were performed in the same buffer (CaCl2 was omitted in Mn2+ quenching experiments). Inhibition of the mitochondria was performed 5 min before phenylephrine stimulation by the addition of 5 μm rotenone, 5 μg/ml oligomycin, and 1 μm CCCP. Ca2+ measurements in permeabilized hepatocytes were carried out as described previously (24Hajnoczky G. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3533-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, the intact cells were loaded for 60 min with 6 μm fura2FF/AM at 37 °C in ECM in the presence of 100 μm BSP and 0.02% pluronic acid, washed in Ca2+-free buffer and permeabilized with 15–25 μg/ml digitonin in intracellular medium composed of 10 mm NaCl, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, 0.2–2 mm ATP, 5 mm CP, 5 units/ml CPK, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, at pH 7.2. Then the cells were washed in the same buffer without digitonin. Inhibition of the mitochondria was performed after permeabilization with digitonin by incubation for 5 min with 10 μm rotenone and 25 μg/ml oligomycin. Fura2 fluorescence images (excitation 340 and 380 nm) were acquired at 3-s intervals with a cooled charged-coupled device (CCD) camera under computer control (25Morgan A.J. Thomas A.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 114: 93-123PubMed Google Scholar). Mn2+ quenching of fura2/AM fluorescence was measured at 360 nm, a Ca2+-insensitive excitation wavelength. Isolation and [Ca2+]c Imaging Measurements of Perfused Intact Rat Liver—The livers of fed male anesthetized rats of 200–250 g of body weight were perfused in situ through the portal vein as described in detail previously (26Robb-Gaspers L.D. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8102-8107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We used the acetoxymethyl ester of fura2 and Fluo3 as Ca2+-sensitive indicators (5 μm) to load the organ. The Fluo3 fluorescence was monitored with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope (488 nm excitation). The fura2 fluorescence was monitored using a cooled CCD camera. The excitation wavelengths were alternatively 340 nm and 380 nm. We achieved deblurring of the non-confocal images by using a deconvolution algorithm described in Monck et al. (27Monck J.R. Oberhauser A.F. Keating T.J. Fernandez J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), as described previously (26Robb-Gaspers L.D. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8102-8107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of n observations. Statistical differences of the data were evaluated by paired or unpaired Student's t test and considered significant at p < 0.05. RyR mRNA Expression—To determine RyR mRNA expression in rat hepatocytes, we isolated total mRNA and amplified RyR cDNA by RT-PCR. We used both consensus primers and isoform-specific primers. The consensus primer pair led to amplification of the expected band of 741 bp (data not shown). We next used the three isoform-specific pairs of primers. The PCR products amplified with h-RyR1-isoform-specific primers reveal the expected band of 435 bp (Fig. 1A), while the primers for isoforms 2 and 3 did not lead to any RT-PCR products (data not shown). Lane 3 on Fig. 1B shows that the RT negative control does not produce any band, excluding any genomic contamination. We also confirmed the veracity of our results by extracting the 435-bp band and sequencing the PCR product. The sequencing showed 100% homology with the rat RyR1 sequence (GenBank™ accession number XM_001078539). These primers were designed to amplify a region in the C terminus of the RyR1, which contains the putative pore. We then repeated the PCR analysis with primers designed to amplify a portion of the N-terminal of RyR1 (primers a-RyR1). In these experiments, we did not detect any positive result in liver, even after 55 amplification cycles. On the other hand, these primers gave the expected band of 301 bp in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1A). To further characterize the RyR message expressed in hepatocytes, we designed a series of primers along the RyR1 protein and used them on both hepatocytes and skeletal muscle cDNA. Every set of primers amplified the expected products in skeletal muscle, while the primers b-, c-, and d-RyR1 did not lead to any band in hepatocytes. On the other hand, the primers e-, f-, and g-RyR1 gave a positive result with hepatocyte cDNA, comparable with that observed with the C-terminal primers (Fig. 1A). We also carried out an experiment in which we combined isolated hepatocytes and skeletal muscle tissue before isolating the total mRNA. This was done to investigate whether some kind of mRNA degradation might be taking place in the processing of the hepatocytes. However, Fig. 1C shows that in the region where we could not detect RyR1 message in hepatocytes, we still have positive results in the hepatocyte/skeletal muscle mixture extract. Therefore, it appears that in hepatocytes the RyR1 message starts around 8500 bp of the full-length 15,220 bp RyR1 protein. Evidence for an even shorter truncated form of the RyR1 has been reported previously (28Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Nishi M. Ikeda M. Sugimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Characterization and cloning of the hepatocyte RyR1 variant will be the subject of a future study. [3H]Ryanodine Binding in Hepatic Microsomes and Permeabilized Hepatocytes—We examined the binding of [3H]ryanodine to microsomes prepared from rat liver to verify the expression of RyRs at the protein level. Fig. 2A demonstrates that [3H]ryanodine binding to liver microsomes is saturable with a KD of 3 nm and a Bmax of 25 fmol/mg of protein. We repeated the same experiment using permeabilized hepatocytes in order to avoid the possibility of [3H]ryanodine binding to non-parenchyma liver cells, such as Kupffer or endothelial cells (the isolated hepatocyte preparation is >99% hepatocytes). In permeabilized hepatocytes we obtained very similar results with saturable ryanodine binding that yielded a KD of 6 nm and a Bmax of 14 fmol/mg of protein (Fig. 2B). These KD values are in agreement with previous data where the KD was estimated to be between 8 and 12 nm in liver microsomes (13Shoshan-Barmatz V. Pressley T.A. Higham S. Kraus-Friedmann N. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Shoshan-Barmatz V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Bmax value for the hepatic RyR should be compared with the much higher density of RyR1 in terminal cisternae of skeletal muscle SR, where a value of 2.6 pmol/mg protein has been reported (29Pessah I.N. Stambuk R.A. Casida J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 232-238PubMed Google Scholar). We also tested the effect of various pharmacological compounds on ryanodine binding to the hepatic RyR. [3H]Ryanodine binding to hepatic microsomes was inhibited by 67% in the presence of caffeine (5 mm), an activator of RyR, and by sodium dantrolene (100 μm), an inhibitor of RyR. Ruthenium red (100 μm), heparin (100 μg/ml), or cADPR (2 μm) did not significantly affect [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 2C). Microinjection Studies in Single Hepatocytes—We investigated RyR-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER by microinjection of the known RyR agonist cADPR. In Indo1-loaded freshly isolated hepatocytes, the microinjection of 2 μm cADPR induced a cytosolic Ca2+ response as depicted in Fig. 3A. We then tested the specificity of the cADPR-evoked Ca2+ release using the specific inhibitor 8-bromo-cADPR (8-Br-cADPR). Microinjecting cADPR plus 8-Br-cADPR drastically decreased the [Ca2+]c peak compared with the control (ΔRatio cADPR 2 μm = 0.203 ± 0.032; ΔRatio cADPR 2 μm + 8-Br-cADPR 150 μm = 0.071 ± 0.029). 8-Br-cADPR completely abolished Ca2+ release in 50% of the 12 cells analyzed (Fig. 3B). The inhibition was cADPR-specific, because the inhibitor did not interfere with the Ca2+ responses evoked by microinjecting IP3 (Fig. 3D). We also attempted to use heparin, an inhibitor of IP3Rs, in order to further characterize the actions of cADPR, but unfortunately heparin microinjection was not effective in blocking IP3-mediated Ca2+ release. This is probably because heparin is a competitive inhibitor and our microinjection system was unable to deliver sufficient inhibitory concentrations of heparin inside the cells because of its high molecular weight compared with IP3. Five cells were also injected with vehicle to check the specificity of the Ca2+ responses by the different compounds and we never detected any [Ca2+]c alterations (Fig. 3E). This set of experiments supports the presence of a cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ pool in the ER of hepatocytes, which is distinct from the IP3Rs. Effect of Ryanodine on IP3-dependent Cytosolic Ca2+ Oscillations—We examined the effect of ryanodine on [Ca2+]c at the single cell level in freshly isolated and overnight cultured fura2-loaded hepatocytes. It should be noted that relatively high ryanodine concentrations are frequently required in intact cells because of the poor membrane permeability of this agent. Direct application of 1–100 μm ryanodine did not lead to any detectable alteration of the basal Ca2+ and did not trigger any [Ca2+]c oscillations in overnight cultured cells (data not shown). In the fresh preparations, very few cells seemed to respond directly to ryanodine, but the low occurrence of this result lead us to attribute the effect to an autocrine or paracrine factor, such as ATP. In support of this, freshly isolated hepatocytes occasionally show [Ca2+]c oscillations without any hormonal stimulation. Caffeine is frequently utilized as a diagnostic tool to detect the presence of RyRs in cells. Unfortunately, the application of caffeine to intact hepatocytes does not act as classical activator of RyR, but inhibits agonist-induced [Ca2+]c oscillations (data not shown). The molecular mechanism underlying the actions of caffeine on hepatic Ca2+ signals have not been fully delineated (30Sanchez-Bueno A. Marrero I. Cobbold P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 728-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether the RyR has a role in hepatocyte Ca2+ signaling, we analyzed the effect of ryanodine on [Ca2+]c responses generated by receptor agonists. For these experiments ryanodine was added to hepatocyte cultures during continuous exposure to phenylephrine, an IP3-forming agonist. Addition of 50–100 μm ryanodine resulted in an overall increase in the frequency of [Ca2+]c oscillations. Fig. 4A shows a representative experiment. We analyzed 135 cells (n = 6 different cell preparations) that responded to phenylephrine and maintained a [Ca2+]c oscillatory pattern after addition of ryanodine. These hepatocytes showed an average basal frequency of 0.55 ± 0.03 oscillations/min and increased to 0.76 ± 0.03 after ryanodine administration. We also recorded 10 cells that started to oscillate, 13 cells that showed a sustained [Ca2+]c increase after ryanodine challenge (Fig. 4, B and C), and 10 cells where addition of ryanodine stopped [Ca2+]c oscillations (not shown). We obtained the same results using vasopressin (data not shown) indicating that the ryanodine effect is not agonist-specific, but is an intrinsic property of the Ca2+ signal induced by the phosphoinositide cascade. We also investigated the possible role of mitochondria in mediating the actions of ryanodine. Mitochondria play a pivotal role in the regulation of Ca2+ feedback on IP3Rs (31Hajnoczky G. Hager R. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14157-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and a previous report suggested the presence of RyR in heart mitochondria (32Beutner G. Sharma V.K. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. Sheu S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21482-21488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Our unpublished data show that ryanodine slows down Ca2+ uptake in hepatic mitochondria. Therefore, we tested whether the effect of ryanodine could have been because of slower mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake that would provide an increased pool of Ca2+ for positive feedback on the IP3R. Inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake with rotenone, oligomycin, and CCCP did not prevent the increase in [Ca2"

The pathogenic and therapeutic effects of arsenite are associated with cellular apoptotic responses. However, the molecular mechanisms of arsenite-induced apoptosis are not very well understood. Our previous study has shown that arsenite exposure is able to activate JNKs, which subsequently mediate the apoptotic outcome. The present study further revealed that the coordination of JNK1 and JNK2 was critical for the arsenite-induced expression of GADD45α (growth arrest and DNA damage 45α), which in turn mediated the cellular apoptosis. The arsenite-induced apoptosis and GADD45α expression were significantly impaired in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in either jnk1 (JNK1–/–) or jnk2 (JNK2–/–). Knockdown of GADD45α by its specific small interfering RNA also dramatically reduced the apoptotic responses, and overexpression of GADD45α in either JNK1–/– or JNK2–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts partially resensitized the cell death. Furthermore, it was found that the regulation of GADD45α by JNK1 and JNK2 was achieved through mediating the activation of c-Jun, since in the JNK1–/– and JNK2–/– cells the c-Jun activation was impaired, and overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of c-Jun (TAM67) in wild type cells could also block GADD45α induction as well as cellular apoptosis.

Our results demonstrate that the coordination of JNK1 and JNK2 is critical for c-Jun/GADD45α-mediated cellular apoptosis induced by arsenite. Arsenite occurs naturally in the earth's crust and is widely distributed in the environment (1International Agency for Research on CancerLyon: IARC. 1980; 23: 39-142Google Scholar). Human exposure to arsenite occurs mainly by ingestion of drinking water contaminated with arsenite from naturally occurring sources or through the inhalation of contaminated dusts in occupational settings (2Bernstam L. Nriagu J. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B Crit. Rev. 2000; 3: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As an environmental pathogen, arsenite causes a series of pathophysiological alterations, including immunosuppression and carcinogenesis (3Bettley F. O'Shea J. Br. J. Dermatol. 1975; 92: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, arsenite has also been applied as chemotherapeutic reagents to treat various neoplasmas (4Soignet S.L. Maslak P.

Further insights into the pathogenic and therapeutic effects of arsenite show that it seems to be associated with the apoptotic induction in both normal and tumor cells (5Ivanov V.N. Hei T.K. J.

These observations suggest that the alternation of the cascades of cellular survival/proapoptotic signaling pathways may be critical for cell apoptotic responses triggered by arsenite. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. In this study, we applied wild type (WT), 2The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PARP, poly(ADP) polymerase; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DiOC6, 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide. 2The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PARP, poly(ADP) polymerase; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DiOC6, 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide. JNK1–/–, and JNK2–/–, three immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to evaluate the roles of JNK1 and JNK2 in arsenite-induced apoptosis. It was found that the arsenite-induced apoptosis required both JNK1 and JNK2, since the deficiency of either impaired the apoptotic responses. Interestingly, GADD45α (growth arrest and DNA damage 45α) was detected to be a downstream target gene transcriptionally regulated by either JNK1 or JNK2, and it functioned as the critical mediator for the JNK1- and JNK2-associated apoptosis by arsenite. In addition, the regulation of GADD45α by JNK1 and JNK2 was, at least in part, dependent on c-Jun activation. Cell Culture—Immortalized WT, JNK1–/– (13Sabapathy K. Kallunki T. David J.-P. Graef I.

Plasmids and Transfection—HA-tagged murine jnk1 and jnk2 full-length cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector, confirmed by DNA sequencing, and then named as HA-JNK1/pcDNA3 and HA-JNK2/pcDNA3, respectively (15Baud V.

A pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing c-Jun dominant negative mutant (pcDNA3.1/His-TAM67) was kindly provided by Dr. Tim G. Bowden (College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ) and Dr. Matthew Young (Center for Cancer Research, NCI-Frederick) (17Cooper S.J. MacGowan J. Ranger-Moore J. Young M.R. Colburn N.H. Bowden G.T. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 848-854PubMed Google Scholar). An expression construct containing HA-tagged full-length cDNA of murine gadd45α (HA-GADD45α) was described previously (18Zhao H. Jin S. Antinore M.J. Lung F.-D.T. Fan F. Blanck P. Roller P. Fornace J.A.J. Zhan Q. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). HA-tagged JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein expression vector was a generous gift from Dr. Han-Ming Shen (Department of Community, Occupational, and Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore). Transfection experiments were performed with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. For the transfection of pcDNA3.1/His-TAM67 into WT MEFs, 5 μg of plasmids were used, and the stable transfectants were generated by G418 selection (500 μg/ml). For the transfection of HA-JNK1/pcDNA3, HA-JNK2/pcDNA3, or HA-GADD45α in JNK1–/– and JNK2–/– MEFs, 5 μg of the individual plasmids were co-transfected with 0.8 μg of the hygromycin-resistant plasmid, respectively. The stable transfectants were established by hygromycin selections (50 μg/ml for JNK1–/– cells and 400 μg/ml for JNK2–/– cells). The GADD45α siRNA expression plasmids were made by using the GeneSuppressor™ system (Imgenex Co., San Diego, CA). The two siRNA target sequences for gadd45α were as follows: 5′-GTG CTC AGC AAG GCT CGG A-3′ (siRNA1) and 5′-GCT GCT CAA CGT AGA CCC C-3′ (siRNA2). Constructs containing the reversed target sequences were used as a negative control. The GADD45α siRNA1 and siRNA2 were co-transfected into WT MEFs, and the stable transfectants were established by G418 selection. Flow Cytometry—To analyze the apoptotic cells with propidium iodide staining, WT, JNK1–/–, and JNK2–/– cells were plated in 6-well plates with a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and cultured in normal 10% serum medium until 70–80% confluence. After exposure to 20 μm sodium arsenite (Fisher) for 24 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation and fixed in ice-cold 80% ethanol at–20 °C overnight. The fixed cells were stained in the buffer containing 100 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml RNase A, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide at 4 °C for 1 h and then analyzed by an Epics XL fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL) as described in our previous publication (19Ouyang W. Ma Q. Li J. Zhang D. Liu Z.-g. Rustgi A.K. Huang C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9287-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine the cell mitochondrial membrane potential by fluorochrome DiOC6 staining, the WT cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After exposure to 20 μm arsenite for 24 h, the cells were applied with 10 μg/ml DiOC6 dye (dissolved in Me2SO and diluted with phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min. The stained cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and analyzed by flow cytometry (20Huang C. Zhang Z. Ding M. Li J. Ye J. Leonard S.S. Shen H.-M. Butterworth L.

To detect the activated caspase-3, the APO ACTIVE 3™ kit (Cell Technology Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was applied as previously described (21Walker N.P.C. Talanian R.V. Brady K.D. Dang L.C. Bump N.J. Ferenza C.R. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Hackett M.C. Hammill L.D. Cell. 1994; 78: 343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested by centrifugation 24 h after arsenite exposure, fixed at room temperature for 30 min, labeled with anti-activated caspase-3 antibody for 1 h, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody in the dark for 30 min. The cells labeled with anti-activated caspase-3 antibody were detected by flow cytometry. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for jnk1 and jnk2 Gene Knock-out Identification—To identify jnk1 and jnk2 gene deficiencies in JNK1–/– and JNK2–/– cells, genomic DNA was isolated from the cells, and the deleted targets of jnk1 and jnk2 sequences were amplified by PCR using two pairs of primers designed from the jnk1 and jnk2 genomic sequences according to previous publications with some modifications (13Sabapathy K.

Wagner E.F. Karin M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 116-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The primer sequences for jnk1 were 5′-CGT CTG GTG GAA GGA GAG AG-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-TAA TAA CGG GGG TGG AGG AT-3′ (antisense primer) (13Sabapathy K. Kallunki T. David J.-P. Graef I. Karin M. Wagner E.F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The primer sequences for jnk2 were 5′-TCT GAC GTC CTG GGC TGG AC-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GCA GCA GCC CTC AGG ATC CT-3′ (antisense primer) (14Sabapathy K. Hu Y. Kallunki T. Schreiber M. David J.-P. Jochum W. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 116-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide, and the images were scanned using a UV light. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Twelve hours after exposure to arsenite, cells were collected, and total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total cDNA was synthesized by ThermoScript™ RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). The amount of GADD45α mRNA was measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR using a pair of primers (5′-ATG ACT TTG GAG GAA TTC TCG-3′ and 5′-CAC TGA TCC ATG TAG CGA CTT-3′). The control mouse β-actin mRNA was also detected by RT-PCR using the primers (5′-GAC GAT GAT ATT GCC GCA CT-3′ and 5′-GAT ACC ACG CT T GCT CTG AG-3′). The PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide, and the images were scanned with a UV light. Western Blotting—MEFs and their transfectants were plated in the 6-well plates and cultured in normal 10% serum medium until 70–80% confluence. After exposure to arsenite for various doses and time periods as indicated in the figure legends, the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected with SDS-sample buffer (22Li J. Chen H. Ke Q. Feng Z. Tang M.-S. Liu B. Amin S. Costa M. Huang C. Mol. Carcinog. 2004; 40: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cell extracts were sonicated, denatured by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, and quantified with a Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal aliquots of cell extracts were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), blocked, and probed with one of the polyclonal antibodies against phospho-specific c-Jun and JNK1/2, nonphosphorylated c-Jun and JNK1/2, HA (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), poly(ADP) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3, GADD45α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or β-actin (Sigma). Primary antibody-bound proteins were detected by using an alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody and an ECF Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences) (23Wang J. Ouyang W. Li J. Wei L. Ma Q. Zhang Z. Tong Q. He J. Huang C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6601-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Arsenite Induces Apoptosis in MEFs—To study the effect of arsenite in cell apoptosis, MEFs were incubated with 20 μm arsenite for 24 h. The key step of the apoptotic process is chromosome DNA degradation. The degraded DNA fragments are then encapsulated in the apoptotic bodies that can be detected by flow cytometry as sub-G0/G1 phase cells (24Das T. Sa G. Sinha P. Ray P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, exposure of MEFs to arsenite resulted in significant accumulation of sub-G0/G1 phase cells by 55.50% compared with 1.12% in the cells without arsenite exposure, indicating that arsenite caused the cellular DNA fragmentation in the MEFs. Next we examined whether arsenite-induced DNA fragmentation was associated with caspase-3 activation, the key executor of apoptosis, by using an APO ACTIVE 3™ kit and Western blotting assay. Arsenite exposure led to over 8-fold increases of the activated caspase-3 compared with that of medium control cells detected by flow cytometry (36.87% versus 4.53%) (Fig. 1B). Western blotting data further confirmed the presence of the activated caspase-3 (17-kDa band) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, PARP, an intracellular substrate of the activated caspase-3, was also detected cleaved from 116-kDa to 85-kDa fragments after arsenite treatment (Fig. 1C). The MEFs were also exposed to 5 μm arsenite for 24 h; however, no obvious cell death was observed, as indicated by the absence of caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage (Fig. 1C), so 5 μm of arsenite treatment was used as a negative control in the following studies. It may be noticed that the cytotoxicity of arsenite to cells is dependent on the forms of arsenite used (25Cai B. Chang S.H. Becker E.B.E. Bonni A. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25215-25222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26Huang C. Bode A. Chen N. Ma W. Li J. Nomura M. Dong Z. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 261-267PubMed Google Scholar) and cell types as well as species (27Muscarella D.E. O'Brien K.A. Lemley A.T. Bloom S.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2003; 74: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28Davison K. Mann K.K. Waxman S. Miller Jr., W.H. Blood. 2004; 103: 3496-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For example, the cytotoxicity as well as cellular biological effects of arsenic trioxide and sodium arsenite are quite different when they are compared at the same concentration, which has been observed from the findings of various laboratories (5Ivanov V.N. Hei T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22747-22758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Lau A.T.Y. Li M. Xie R. He Q.-Y. Chiu J.-F. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mitochondria potential reduction has been reported to be critical for the apoptotic induction through the mitochondria pathway (29Solary E. Bettaieb A. Dubrez-Daloz L. Corcos L. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2003; 44: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Larochette N. Decaudin D. Jacotot E. Brenner C. Marzo I. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Xie Z. Reed J. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar); therefore, the mitochondria potential was measured by fluorochrome DiOC6 staining. As shown in Fig. 1D, DiOC6 incorporation was 35% less in the arsenite-treated cells compared with that of the medium control cells (53.73% versus 89.25%), indicating that arsenite exposure reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential. These data strongly indicate that arsenite is able to induce apoptosis in MEFs. Coordination of JNK1 and JNK2 Is Required for the Arsenite-induced Apoptosis—The proapoptotic role of JNKs has been proposed recently in different cellular conditions (8Huang C. Ma W. Li J. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3053-3058PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lau A.T.Y. Li M. Xie R. He Q.-Y. Chiu J.-F. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Namgung U. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6442-6451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Muscarella D.E. Bloom S.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 68: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but their precise molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. To gain further insight into the JNK1- and/or JNK2-dependent proapoptotic signal pathway, we compared the apoptosis induction by arsenite in WT, JNK1–/–, and JNK2–/– MEFs. Before performing the comparison experiments, the jnk1 and jnk2 gene deficiencies in their knock-out MEFs were initially confirmed by both Western blotting and PCR (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, both JNK1–/– and JNK2–/– cells were resistant to arsenite-induced apoptosis, as indicated by the absence of the increased sub-G0/G1 phase cells after the arsenite treatment for 24 h in the two knock-out cell lines (7.88% in JNK1–/– cells and 0.70% in JNK2–/– cells) compared with that in WT cells (53.49%) (Fig. 2B). Similarly, neither caspase-3 activation nor PARP cleavage was observed in the arsenite-treated JNK1–/– and JNK2–/– MEFs (Fig. 2C). Even when the arsenite treatment time was prolonged to 48 h, there was still no obvious cell death observed in the two knock-out cell lines (Fig. 2D). All of these data suggested that JNK1 and JNK2 were both required for arsenite-induced apoptosis, and a deficiency of either one did impair the apoptotic response. However, the cell death induced by other environmental carcinogens, such as nickel chloride, was not different among JNK1–/–, JNK2–/–, and WT MEFs, as indicated by morphological changes (Fig. 2E) or caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage (Fig. 2F). This demonstrates that the escape from apoptosis due to the deficiency of either jnk1 or jnk2 is a relatively specific feature in the cells, at least in MEFs, when exposed to arsenite. To further confirm the essential requirement of JNK1 and JNK2 in arsenite-induced apoptosis, we stably reconstituted the HA-tagged JNK1 or JNK2 into their deficient MEFs (Fig. 3A). As expected, the restored expression of either JNK1 or JNK2 in each knock-out cell line mostly returned their abilities as WT MEFs to undergo apoptosis as indicated by caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage (Fig. 3B). It need be noted here that the stable transfectants of JNK1 or JNK2 reconstitutional cells were established as a mass pool, which might include a proportion of unsuccessfully transfected cells, so the exogenous JNK1 or JNK2 was expressed much lower as compared with those in WT cells (Fig. 3A). Expression of GADD45α Is Regulated by the c-Jun-dependent Pathway—GADD45α was originally identified as a gene transcribed in response to DNA damage by UV irradiation (32Hollander M.C. Alamo I. Jackman J. Wang M.G. McBride O.W. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24385-24393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been reported to be involved in many biological functions, such as suppressing cell growth (33Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell.

Leukemia. 2002; 16: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 37Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.-H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 575-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To determine whether GADD45α is the downstream target gene of JNK1 and JNK2 in responses to arsenite exposure, the GADD45α induction was detected in WT and the two JNK knock-out MEFs. As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment with 20 μm arsenite obviously induced GADD45α protein expression in WT MEFs at all of the time points tested. It was more important to observe that this induction was blocked in either JNK1–/– or JNK2–/– MEFs, indicating that JNK1 and JNK2 were both critical for the GADD45α up-regulation in response to arsenite. This notion was further confirmed by the reconstitution experiments, which showed that restoring JNK1 or JNK2 led to an obvious GADD45α induction in their respective knock-out cells, although not as strong as those in the WT MEFs (Fig. 4B), which was consistent with the exogenous JNK1 or JNK2 expression levels of the reconstituted cells (Fig. 3A). To determine the mechanisms of GADD45α induction by JNK1 and JNK2, we also tested the changes of the gadd45α mRNA level. The RT-PCR data showed that arsenite-induced gadd45α mRNA expression was readily observed in the WT cells; however, it was reduced due to jnk1 deficiency and totally blocked in jnk2-deficient cells (Fig. 5A), coinciding with the basal levels of JNKs protein expression in these two knockout cell lines (Fig. 2A) as well as their sensitivities to arsenite-associated cell death (Fig. 2B), indicating that JNK1 and JNK2 were required for the arsenite-associated GADD45α mRNA induction. Transcription factor c-Jun is a well known downstream target of JNKs (38Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the relevance of c-Jun for JNK1- and JNK2-mediated GADD45α induction, the activation of JNK and c-Jun in WT, JNK1–/–, and JNK2–/– MEFs were analyzed. Arsenite exposure led to phosphorylation of both JNK1 and JNK2 in WT cells. In JNK1–/– cells, the obvious phosphorylation of JNK2 was observed; however, in JNK2–/– cells, the phosphorylated JNK1 was comparably weaker, which may be due to the lower expression level of basal JNK1 protein in JNK2–/– MEFs (Fig. 5B). c-Jun activation was indicated by phophorylations of c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73, the critical residues for c-Jun activation (39Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Compared with the full phosphorylation of c-Jun up to 8 h of arsenite exposure in WT cells, jnk1 deficiency resulted in relative low activation of c-Jun, and jnk2 deficiency led to an even more obvious attenuation of c-Jun activation (Fig. 5B), which was consistent with the phosphorylated JNK levels in JNK1–/– and JNK2–/– cells as well as the GADD45α mRNA induction in these cell lines (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the cascade activation of JNKs/c-Jun regulated the induction of GADD45α. To test whether blocking c-Jun activation was responsible for impairing GADD45α induction, a plasmid containing a dominant negative mutant of c-Jun (TAM67) was stably transfected into WT MEFs. As expected, TAM67 totally blocked c-Jun phosphorylations (Fig. 5C) and dramatically reduced GADD45α induction (Fig. 5D), indicating that the activation of c-Jun was essential for GADD45α induction by arsenite. These results provide strong evidence that blocking GADD45α induction upon deficiency of jnk1 or jnk2 is, at least in part, due to repressing the activation of c-Jun. This may suggest that the JNK1/2/c-Jun signaling pathway is one of the signaling pathways involved in GADD45α induction in cell response to arsenite exposure. However, the JNK1/2/c-Jun pathway is not the only mediator for GADD45α induction by arsenite. This notion was supported by our findings that only activating the JNK1/c-Jun pathway by transfection with a plasmid expressing HA-tagged JNKK2-JNK1 fusion protein in WT cells or by transfection of c-Jun expression vector in JNK1–/– cells (Figs. 5, E and G) was not able to elevate GADD45α protein expression (Fig. 5, F and H). Moreover, overexpression of exogenous c-Jun in the JNK1–/– cell (Fig. 5G) could not restore the arsenite-induced apoptotic response (Fig. 5, H and I), indicating that some other pathway(s) may also be critical for GADD45α induction as well as apoptotic promotion in cell response to arsenite exposure. JNK1- and JNK2-mediated GADD45α Induction Is Essential for Arsenite-associated Apoptosis—To elucidate the importance of GADD45α in the arsenite-induced apoptosis, we applied siRNA technology to inhibit endogenous GADD45α expression to determine whether blocking GADD45α expression could affect cellular apoptotic responses. The two different GADD45α siRNA constructs were co-transfected into WT MEFs, and the siRNA efficiency was shown in Fig. 6A. Arsenite-induced apoptotic related cellular morphological alterations, such as cell shrinkage, bubble, and detachment, were partially impaired by knockdown of endogenous GADD45α (Fig. 6B). The interference with apoptosis by the GADD45α siRNA was further confirmed by the absence of caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage (Fig. 6C), suggesting that GADD45α is critical for arsenite-induced apoptosis. The relevance of GADD45α in JNK1- and JNK2-mediated apoptosis was directly tested by stably expressing GADD45α in JNK1–/– and JNK2–/– MEFs (Fig. 7A). Overexpression of HA-tagged GADD45α partially sensitized the arsenite-induced apoptosis in both JNK1–/– and JNK2–/– MEFs, indicated by the apoptotic morphological alterations and caspase-3 activation as well as PARP cleavage (Fig. 7, B and C). Therefore, our data provide strong evidence that blocking GADD45α induction in either JNK1–/– or JNK2–/– MEFs can protect cells from the arsenite-associated apoptosis. These results further imply that JNK1- and JNK2-dependent cell death stimulated by arsenite, for a large part, is media"

Cytosolic proteolysis is a key cellular process. In addition to its role in amino acid metabolism, it is responsible for protein quality control and the adjustment of the turnover of regulatory molecules (1Kirschner M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M42-M45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M42-M45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Through oligomerization, these enzymes form barrel-like cellular subcompartments to protect cytoplasmic proteins from unwanted cleavage; the active sites are situated in proteolytic chambers, only accessible to unfolded polypeptides. In Eukarya and Archaea, the 20 S proteasome is the core of this proteolytic system (3Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E.

The final breakdown of these fragments is probably achieved by a collection of ATP-independent exopeptidases, which have been proposed to be essential components of the protein degradation system (7Botbol V.

Structural studies on the Tricorn protease complex, an archaeal carboxypeptidase (peptidyl-di/tripeptidase), have shown that some exopeptidases can also form multimeric ring structures, with the active sites sequestered within an internal chamber (9Tamura T. Tamura N. Cejka Z. Hegerl R. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W. Science. 1996; 274: 1385-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This feature of compartmentalization was also recognized in the three-dimensional structures of three ATP-independent intracellular aminopeptidases: Gal6, leucine aminopeptidase, and the d-aminopeptidase DppA (10Burley S.K. David P.R. Sweet R.M. Taylor A. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 11Joshua-Tor L. Xu H.E. Johnston S.A. Rees D.C.

Biol. 2001; 8: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the tripeptidyl-peptidase II also forms a giant, well organized toroidal oligomeric structure (13Rockel B. Peters J. Muller S.A. Seyit G. Ringler P. Hegerl R. Glaeser R.M. Baumeister W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10135-10140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All these exopeptidases could function as scavengers of the oligopeptides generated by the ATP-dependent endoproteases (14Yao T. Cohen R.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R551-R553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TET is another type of a large hollow peptidase complex. It was characterized initially in the halophilic Archaea Haloarcula marismortui (15Franzetti B. Schoehn G. Hernandez J.F. Jaquinod M. Ruigrok R.W. Zaccai G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The complex has a tetrahedral shape and is a broad substrate specificity aminopeptidase capable of degrading large peptides. In the MEROPS peptidase data base (16Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D160-D164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TET belongs to the M42 family of metallopeptidases (clan MH). Pyrococcus horikoshii is an anaerobic Archaea, which grows optimally at 98 °C. It was isolated from hydrothermal fluid samples obtained at a depth of 1395 m in the Pacific Ocean (17Gonzalez J.M. Masuchi Y. Robb F.T. Ammerman J.W. Maeder D.L. Yanagibayashi M. Tamaoka J. Kato C. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We recently showed that the P. horikoshii TET2 protein (PhTET2), 5The abbreviations used are: PhTET2, P. horikoshii TET2; HmTET, Haloarcula marismortui TET; PhTET1-12s, P. horikoshii TET1 12-subunit complex; PhTET1-24s, P. horikoshii TET1 24-subunit complex; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); pNA, 4-nitroaniline; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; AAP, V.

(formerly Aeromonas) proteolyticus aminopeptidase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. which shares 24% identity with the HmTET, is a 12-subunit tetrahedral aminopeptidase that displays a nonprocessive catalytic activity against N-terminal aliphatic and neutral amino acids (18Durá M.A. Receveur-Brechot V. Andrieu J.P. Ebel C. Schoehn G. Roussel A. Franzetti B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3477-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The structure of the PhTET2 edifice reveals the self-compartmentalizing nature of the complex (19Russo S. Baumann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51275-51281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Borissenko L. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the genome of P. horikoshii, the open reading frame PH0519 encodes a homolog of PhTET2 that has been characterized as a cobalt-activated peptidase, suspected to be a deblocking aminopeptidase and thereby named DAP (21Ando S. Ishikawa K. Ishida H. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Kosugi Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of PH0519, presented here, show that it can assemble alternatively as a tetrahedral dodecameric particle (therefore called PhTET1-12s) or as an octahedral tetracosameric edifice (PhTET1-24s). These assemblies are different from those observed in the other self-compartmentalized protease complexes of known three-dimensional structures. A mechanism of action for PhTET1 based on its peculiar compartmentalization and structural features is proposed. The expression of the PH0519 protein from P. horikoshii in Escherichia coli, its purification, and the crystallization conditions are described elsewhere (22Porciero S. Receveur-Bréchot V. Mori K. Franzetti B. Roussel A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2005; 61: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Generation of the Model—We started with images obtained by negatively staining a PhTET1 sample with sodium silicotungstate, pH 7.5. Two different types of particles were observed. The images of the smaller particle were similar to the images of halophilic TET aminopeptidase (15Franzetti B. Schoehn G. Hernandez J.F. Jaquinod M. Ruigrok R.W. Zaccai G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For the larger particle, at least two different characteristic views are easy to recognize: one ring made by six spots of density and a wheel-like structure (Fig. 1A). Two-dimensional averaging of 20 particles from each type, respectively, exhibit 3- and 4-fold symmetry axes. To generate a starting three-dimensional model, the same technique as described previously (15Franzetti B. Schoehn G. Hernandez J.F. Jaquinod M. Ruigrok R.W. Zaccai G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was used but starting with the two-dimensional averages shown in Fig. 1A. Cryoelectron Microscopy—Grids were prepared as described (23Fabry C.M.S. Rosa-Calatrava M. Conway J.F. Zubieta C. Cusack S. Ruigrok R.W. Schoehn G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and observed with a GATAN cryotransfer stage on a Philips CM200 LaB6 microscope at 200 kV. Images were recorded on Kodak SO 163 film under low dose conditions (<10 e-/Å2) at a nominal magnification of 50,000 times with defocus values between 1.2 and 2.5 μm. Good micrographs were digitized on a Zeiss Photoscan TD scanner with a pixel size of 14 μm (2.8 Å pixel-1). Using x3d (24Conway J.F. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), 11,400 small particles and 8,500 big particles from 15 images were selected and interactively boxed into 128 × 128 pixel boxes. These images were then corrected for the contrast transfer function as described (15Franzetti B. Schoehn G. Hernandez J.F. Jaquinod M. Ruigrok R.W. Zaccai G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The structures of both particles were determined using a projection matching method implemented in SPIDER (15Franzetti B. Schoehn G. Hernandez J.F. Jaquinod M. Ruigrok R.W. Zaccai G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). The starting models were, respectively, the three-dimensional structure of HmTET (15Franzetti B. Schoehn G. Hernandez J.F. Jaquinod M. Ruigrok R.W. Zaccai G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the octahedral particle determined using negative staining (see below). For the tetrahedral particle, 159 orientations equally distributed in the tetrahedral asymmetric unit (15Franzetti B. Schoehn G. Hernandez J.F. Jaquinod M. Ruigrok R.W. Zaccai G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were used, and for the octahedral form, 58 different projections covering 1/24 of the space. The refinement (projection matching) was carry out using the phase flipped data set until no further changes were visible in the map (100 cycles for PhTET1-12s and 50 cycles for PhTET1-24s). The final reconstructions were calculated by back projection using the fully contrast transfer function corrected set of images and selecting about 75% of the images that had the highest correlation coefficient against the reprojections of the model (PhTET1-12s, 8,000 particles; PhTET1-24s, 6,000 images). The resolution of the two maps (PhTET1-12s, 14 Å; PhTET1-24s, 15 Å) was determined by splitting the data randomly into two halves and by comparing the resulting reconstructions by Fourier Shell Correlation (26van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 48: 95-100Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar) at 0.3 level (see Supplemental Material and supplemental Fig. 1). X-ray diffraction data were collected from a single selenium-substituted PhTET1-12s crystal on the ID14-4 beam line at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The data frames were processed with XDS (27Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar) and further processed and scaled using SELDAT, SCALKB2, and KBAPLY from the BioMol software suite. 6Groningen Protein Crystallography Group, unpublished data. While structure determination was being attempted using the MAD method, a structural model became available in the Protein Data Bank with the three-dimensional structure of Bacillus subtilis YsdC 7Structural GenomiX Inc., San Diego, unpublished results. (Protein Data Bank code 1VHE). This protein shares 36.3% sequence identity with the PhTET1 subunit. The three-dimensional structure of PhTET1-12s was solved at 3.1 Å resolution by molecular replacement (28Rossmann M.G. Rossmann M.G. The Molecular Replacement Method. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Inc., New York1972Google Scholar). The calculations were performed with PHASER (29Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) using all available diffraction data. The molecular replacement solution has a Z value of 9.62, a log-likelihood gain value of 35.93, and a proper packing inside the F4(1)32 cell, which shows the arrangement of the PhTET1-12s subunits into tetrahedral homo-dodecameric particles. Model refinement is described in the Supplemental Material. The refined model has residual indices Rf = 25.6% and cross-validation Rfree = 33.1%, together with satisfactory geometry. Statistics of data collection and processing, model refinement, and model geometry are listed in the supplemental Table 1. Model quality and stereochemistry were checked using CNS (30Brünger A.T.

Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5699) Google Scholar). The figures were prepared with PyMOL (33DeLano W.L.

Birmanns S. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (unique result with a cross-correlation coefficient of 0.35). The fitting into the octahedral particle was done using URO (35Navazza J. Lepault J. Rey F.A. Álvarez-Rúa C. Borge J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as described (23Fabry C.M.S. Rosa-Calatrava M. Conway J.F. Zubieta C. Cusack S. Ruigrok R.W. Schoehn G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of one monomer was manually placed into the density corresponding to one monomer of the octahedral EM map that makes up the asymmetric unit. URO (35Navazza J. Lepault J. Rey F.A. Álvarez-Rúa C. Borge J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was used to generate a preliminary quasi-atomic model of the octahedral particle by applying all the internal symmetries. The optimization procedure was also performed by using URO (35Navazza J. Lepault J. Rey F.A. Álvarez-Rúa C. Borge J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The quality of the final fit is given by a correlation coefficient of 0.98, a crystallographic R factor of 16.2% and a quadratic misfit of 1.3. The fitted scale factor was 0.91. PhTET1 hydrolytic activity was determined as follows. Reactions were initiated by addition of the enzyme (5 μg/ml, in the case of PhTET1-12s, or 10 μg/ml, for PhTET1-24s) to a prewarmed mixture containing the potential substrate in 50 mm PIPES, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm CoSO4, pH 7.5, and covered by a layer of mineral oil to avoid water evaporation. Incubations were performed at 90 °C. To measure the evolution of the quantity of amino acids and di- and tripeptides in the reaction mixture, 80-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture at 5-min intervals and added to 200 μl of cold acetonitrile to stop the reaction and precipitate the protein, which was separated by centrifugation. Two hundred fifty microliters of supernatant were dried under vacuum. Solids were dissolved in the same volume of Beckman analysis buffer, and the amino acids and small peptides present in each sample were quantified on a model 7300 Beckman amino acid analyzer, using the standard sodium citrate elution buffer system. To follow the progress of peptidyl- and aminoacyl-pNA compounds in the reaction mixture, the solids remaining after drying were dissolved in 125 μl of chromatography initial solvent (eluent A). Fifty microliters were injected on a μRPC C2/C18 ST column (4.6 × 100 mm) (Amersham Biosciences) in an ÄKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatographic conditions were dependent of the peptide mixture, but in all cases eluent A contained 0.065% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 2% (v/v) acetonitrile in water, and eluent B contained 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile. Flow was adjusted at 0.5 ml/min, and runs were carried out at room temperature. Calibrations were made by using authentic standards. Each sample was accompanied by an appropriate enzyme blank. Direct assay of generated pNA and AMC is described in the Supplemental Material. Cryoelectron Microscopy Revealed Tetrahedral and Octahedral Hollow Particles—In gel filtration, the PhTET1 protein yields two peaks with apparent molecular masses of 400 and 800 kDa, respectively (22Porciero S. Receveur-Bréchot V. Mori K. Franzetti B. Roussel A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2005; 61: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation studies, performed on the partially purified complexes, showed that in addition to a particle with a sedimentation coefficient s20,w of 15 S, i.e. the same value as dodecameric PhTET2 (18Durá M.A. Receveur-Brechot V. Andrieu J.P. Ebel C. Schoehn G. Roussel A. Franzetti B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3477-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a large PhTET1 particle was present. This particle displayed an s20,w of 23 S, consistent with an assembly of 24 subunits (results not shown). The PhTET1 complexes were analyzed by negative staining electron microscopy showing two populations of homogeneous particles (Fig. 1A). Cryoelectron microscopy images were obtained, and their respective quaternary structures were determined by image analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction. The three-dimensional structures of the tetrahedral and octahedral particles, at resolutions of ∼15 Å, are shown in Fig. 1C, left and right panel, respectively. The 12-subunit assembly is a tetrahedron of largest dimension of ∼134 Å, which is similar to the HmTET protease (15Franzetti B. Schoehn G. Hernandez J.F. Jaquinod M. Ruigrok R.W. Zaccai G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and to the TET2 homolog from P. horikoshii (18Durá M.A. Receveur-Brechot V. Andrieu J.P. Ebel C. Schoehn G. Roussel A. Franzetti B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3477-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Russo S. Baumann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51275-51281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Borissenko L. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Four 20 Å openings (called 3f) are situated in each face of the tetrahedron, and four 15 Å pores (3v) are located at each vertex (Fig. 1, B and C). The tetracosameric assembly is a hollow octahedron that occupies a spherical volume of 180 Å diameter. Two types of holes penetrate the particle: six openings of 25 Å diameter at the vertices or 4-fold symmetry axes of the octahedron (4v) and eight orifices of 20 Å diameter in the center of the facets or 3-fold symmetry axes of the octahedron (3f) (Fig. 1, B and C). Topology of the PhTET1 Subunit—We crystallized the 12-subunit tetrahedral complex. The three-dimensional structure of PhTET1-12s was solved at 3.1 Å resolution by molecular replacement, using the 1.9 Å resolution model of the monomer from the homologous B. subtilis protein YsdC 7Structural GenomiX Inc., San Diego, unpublished results. (Protein Data Bank code 1VHE) as the search probe. The crystal asymmetric unit contains one monomer of PhTET1 of ∼37 kDa. The electron density maps showed no density for the first two N-terminal SeMet residues; the model thus includes only the 330 C-terminal residues of the polypeptide. The subunit is a wedge-shaped parallelepiped of dimensions ∼71 × 47 Å, arranged in two well separated domains (Fig. 2A) as follows: (i) a larger catalytic domain, comprising residues 2-65 and 156-331, and (ii) a smaller dimerization domain (residues 66-153). The catalytic domain is a flattened globule with the topology of a three-layer αβα sandwich arranged around a central, mixed eight-stranded β-sheet (Fig. 2A, orange). In addition, a supplementary mixed four-stranded β-sheet formed by strands β10, β11, β17, and the bent C-terminal end of strand β16 (β16b) of the central β-sheet (Fig. 2A, magenta) is present at the periphery of the catalytic domain, adjacent to the smaller dimerization domain. This additional motif interacts with the dimerization domain of a second subunit to form the dimer (Fig. 2A; supplemental movie 1). Using the coordinates for the catalytic domain only, a similarity search for other three-dimensional structures using the protein structure comparison server SSM (36Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar) returned a positive match to the three-dimensional structure of AAP (37Chevrier B. Schalk C. D'Orchymont H. Rondeau J.M. Moras D. Tarnus C. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 283-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence alignments of PhTET1, PhTET2, Bacillus subtilis YsdC, and AAP are shown in Fig. 2B. AAP lacks almost all the elements of the dimerization domain, in agreement with its monomeric organization. A three-dimensional structure superposition between the 0.95 Å resolution model of AAP (Protein Data Bank code 1RTQ) and the PhTET1 subunit gives a root mean square difference of 1.08 Å for 138 equivalent pairs of α-carbon. This confirms the postulated structural similarity between PhTET1 and clan MH aminopeptidases (39Onoe S. Ando S. Ataka M. Ishikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The crescent-shaped dimerization domain (Fig. 2A, blue) has a mostly β-barrel topology. It is made up of a six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel, completed by two helical segments on the outside of the barrel. The antiparallel β-barrel and one of the helices form the body and one of the tips of the crescent. The other tip is formed by the second helix and by a disordered loop (residues 111-130), where discontinuous electron density is observed for residues 115-122. The initial difference electron density map showed, in the active site region, a very large positive density feature. This was interpreted as caused by the presence of metal ions in the active site. With divalent cobalt present in the crystallization solutions, the positive density disappeared when two divalent cobalt ions were modeled. The metal ligands are identical to those present in AAP (37Chevrier B. Schalk C. D'Orchymont H. Rondeau J.M. Moras D. Tarnus C. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 283-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and PhTET2 (19Russo S. Baumann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51275-51281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Borissenko L. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), with an identical type of coordination. Therefore, the catalytic mechanism of hydrolysis by AAP, PhTET2, and PhTET1 should be extremely similar, if not identical (19Russo S. Baumann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51275-51281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Borissenko L. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 40Stamper C. Bennett B. Edwards T. Holz R.C. Ringe D. Petsko G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7035-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The tertiary structures of PhTET1 and PhTET2, although very similar, are not identical. PhTET2 has 22 amino acids more than PhTET1, and consequently, there are several secondary structure elements in PhTET2 that are not found in PhTET1. In particular, and following the assignment of Russo and Baumann (19Russo S. Baumann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51275-51281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), PhTET2 contains five 310 helices (η1, η2, η4, η5, and η6), one loop (between η3 and β6), and one β-strand (β15) more than PhTET1. Moreover, the 310b helix in PhTET1 is an α-helix (α7) in PhTET2, and some common elements are formed by a different number of amino acids. The crystal structure of PhTET2 contains an S1 hydrophobic specificity pocket adjacent to the metal-binding site (20Borissenko L. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which explains the preferential activity of this aminopeptidase on peptides having an N-terminal hydrophobic or noncharged residue (18Durá M.A. Receveur-Brechot V. Andrieu J.P. Ebel C. Schoehn G. Roussel A. Franzetti B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3477-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The PhTET2 specificity pocket is lined with side chains of Ile238, Leu293, Thr237, Glu291, Lys261, Ile322, and Gly296. Part of this pocket (Leu293, Ile238, and Gly296) is involved in the binding of the inhibitor amastatin (20Borissenko L. Groll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The corresponding pocket in PhTET1 is constituted by the stretch Gly280-Gly281, the guanidinium moiety of Arg248, and the main chains of Phe229, Ala230, and Thr280. It is therefore less hydrophobic than the PhTET2 specificity pocket. In the dodecameric particle, this region of the active site also includes residues 114-118, belonging to the disordered loop of another subunit, which form a positively charged patch. These differences in the active site pockets and subpockets can account for the differences found in the substrate specificity for the two enzymes (see Refs. 21Ando S. Ishikawa K. Ishida H.

Within the Pol III core, ϵ is tightly bound between the α subunit (DNA polymerase) and θ subunit. Here, we present the crystal structure of ϵ in complex with HOT, the bacteriophage P1-encoded homolog of θ, at 2.1 Å resolution. The ϵ-HOT interface is defined by two areas of contact: an interaction of the previously unstructured N terminus of HOT with an edge of the ϵ central β-sheet as well as interactions between HOT and the catalytically important helix α1-loop-helix α2 motif of ϵ. This structure provides insight into how HOT and, by implication, θ may stabilize the ϵ subunit, thus promoting efficient proofreading during chromosomal replication.

The precise mechanisms by which cells are able to duplicate their DNA with both high accuracy (<1 error/1010 bases replicated) and speed (up to 1000 nucleotides/s) are of major interest. Chromosomal replication is performed by multisubunit replicases that conduct the simultaneous, coordinated replication of the leading and lagging strands. Among the model systems currently being investigated, the best understood is that of the bacterium Escherichia coli (1O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10653-10656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2McHenry C.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this organism, chromosomal replication is performed by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (HE) 2The abbreviations used are: HE, E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme; Pol, DNA Polymerase; HOT, bacteriophage P1 homolog of θ; ϵ186, amino acid residues 1-186 of ϵ; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 2The abbreviations used are: HE, E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme; Pol, DNA Polymerase; HOT, bacteriophage P1 homolog of θ; ϵ186, amino acid residues 1-186 of ϵ; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation., a dimeric complex containing 10 distinct subunits (17 total). Within the HE complex (αϵθ)2β4τ2(γδδ′χΨ), there are two polymerase core assemblies (αϵθ), one for each strand, which are the primary determinants of replication fidelity. Each core consists of the α subunit (the polymerase, (Mr = 135,000)), the ϵ subunit (a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease that acts as a proofreader for polymerase misinsertion errors, (Mr = 28,500)), and the θ subunit (Mr = 8,000), connected in the linear order α-ϵ-θ. The ϵ subunit, encoded by the dnaQ gene, plays a critical role within the Pol III core, both catalytically and structurally. Many dnaQ mutants exhibit strong mutator phenotypes, whereas a fully catalytically deficient mutation causes lethality due to excessively high mutation rates (error catastrophe) (3Fijalkowska I.J. Schaaper R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of dnaQ have been generated, but they also proved to be nonviable unless accompanied by a suppressing mutation in the polymerase (4Lancy E.D. Lifsics M.R. Kehres D.G. Maurer R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5572-5580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these studies, ϵ is thought to have at least two functions: a fidelity function and a structural function, due to its tight and presumably stabilizing interaction with the polymerase. Recently, a potential second proofreading activity has been discovered residing in the N-terminal PHP domain of the α subunit (5Stano N.M. Chen J. McHenry C.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 458-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Wieczorek A. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12561-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which also contains the binding site for ϵ. Interaction between ϵ and α is dependent on the C-terminal domain of ϵ (residues 187-243) (7Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McNeill S.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16001-16009Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Taft-Benz S.A. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2963-2965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal domain of ϵ (residues 1-186) contains the exonuclease active site and retains binding affinity for the θ subunit. The θ subunit does not have any known enzymatic function; its role within the Pol III core is presumed to be structural, through its interaction with the ϵ subunit. Strains lacking θ (ΔholE mutants), although viable, are modest mutators (9Taft-Benz S.A. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2774-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that θ plays a role in the fidelity of the Pol III core. E. coli strains carrying certain mutant ϵ subunits (dnaQ mutants) demonstrate a dramatic sensitivity to the presence of the θ subunit. An increase of 1000-fold in the mutability of a dnaQ49 (V96G) strain was observed in the absence of θ (9Taft-Benz S.A. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2774-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The θ subunit also stimulates the exonuclease activity of the ϵ double mutant I170T/V215A when present in the Pol III core complex (10Lehtinen D.A. Perrino F.W. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This observation supports a role for θ in coordinating the α-ϵ polymerase-exonuclease interaction (10Lehtinen D.A. Perrino F.W. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Structural information is critical to understanding the mechanism by which θ modulates exonuclease activity of the Pol III core. Both NMR (11DeRose E.F. Li D.W. Darden T. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 94-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and crystallographic (12Hamdan S. Carr P.D. Brown S.E. Ollis D.L. Dixon N.E.

Otting G. Dixon N.E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4464-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As part of these ongoing studies, we have also investigated the bacteriophage P1 HOT protein, a functional homolog of θ (15Lobocka M.B. Rose D.J. Plunkett G. Rusin M. Samojedny A. Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7032-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 16Chikova A.K. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5528-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The precise role of HOT is unclear, but it may assist in phage replication, which relies on the E. coli replication machinery (15Lobocka M.B. Rose D.J. Plunkett G. Rusin M. Samojedny A. Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7032-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments show that HOT protein can readily substitute for θ. For example, HOT can fully reduce the extreme mutability of the dnaQ49 mutant (16Chikova A.K. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5528-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As the NMR solution structures of θ and HOT are essentially identical (13Mueller G.A. Kirby T.W. DeRose E.F. Li D.W. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7081-7089Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17DeRose E.F. Kirby T.W. Mueller G.A. Chikova A.K. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. Structure. 2004; 12: 2221-2231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and as the HOT protein has shown greater stability in vitro than θ, we have chosen to study the HOT-ϵ186 complex. Based on the crystal structure presented here, HOT does not contribute residues to the active site of ϵ but rather appears to stabilize the enzyme through interactions clustered around two regions. In particular, the N terminus of HOT becomes ordered upon binding ϵ186, forming interactions with backbone atoms of an exposed β-strand of the central β-sheet. The structure of this inter-species complex provides insight into the basis for the accurate replication of the bacteriophage genome in E. coli and also serves as a model for the ϵ-θ complex in the native Pol III holoenzyme. HOT and ϵ186 were expressed and purified as previously described (7Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McNeill S.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16001-16009Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17DeRose E.F. Kirby T.W. Mueller G.A. Chikova A.K. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. Structure. 2004; 12: 2221-2231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The complex of ϵ186 and HOT was prepared by mixing 2 volumes of a 3.8 mg/ml solution of ϵ186 with 1 volume of 3 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, and then adding 0.028 volumes of 62 mg/ml HOT, yielding a ratio of HOT:ϵ186 of 1.03:1. As noted previously, ϵ186 is stabilized in the presence of high Tris concentrations (11DeRose E.F. Li D.W. Darden T. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 94-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mixture was concentrated to ∼30 mg/ml using a Centriprep YM-3 filter unit (Millipore), and the HOT-ϵ186 complex was separated from the excess HOT by gel filtration chromatography using a 2.6 × 60-cm Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) that was eluted at 0.4 ml/min with 25 mm Tris·HCl buffer at pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the complex were concentrated to 24 mg/ml using a Centriprep YM-3 filter unit. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 11544 m-1 cm-1 for HOT, 7292 m-1 cm-1 for ϵ186, and 18836 m-1 cm-1 for the ϵ186-HOT complex. Crystals of the ϵ186-HOT complex were obtained at 4 °C by mixing, in a sitting drop tray, 1 μl of a 24 mg/ml complex in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnSO4, and 5 mm TMP with 1 μl of the reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and 22% polyethylene glycol 6000. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained by streak seeding. After 10 days, crystals reached their maximum size of ∼0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm. Crystals were harvested and transferred to a stabilization solution consisting of 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 23% polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnSO4, and 5 mm TMP. Crystals were then transferred in four steps from the stabilization solution to the cryosolution consisting of 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 25% polyethylene glycol 6000, 15% ethylene glycol, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnSO4, and 5 mm TMP. Crystals were mounted in a loop, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and placed on the goniometer in a stream of nitrogen gas cooled to 93 K. Data were collected using a Rigaku 007HF Micromax generator equipped with VariMax HF mirrors and a Saturn 92 CCD detector. Diffraction data were collected at 2.1 Å resolution and processed using HKL2000 (18Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Acta Physiol. Pol. A. 2002; 101: 613-619Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To obtain phases, the ϵ186 model (Protein Data Bank accession code 1J53) was used for the molecular replacement using Mol-Rep (19Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4133) Google Scholar) in the CCP4i package (20Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two molecules of ϵ186 were found in the asymmetric unit. The two main helices of HOT from the Protein Data Bank coordinates 1SE7 were placed separately into the electron density manually using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). This model was refined in CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16946) Google Scholar). The rest of the HOT molecule was built to the electron density through iterative cycles of model building in O and refinement in CNS. The final model consists of two complexes, each containing one molecule of ϵ186, one molecule of HOT, one TMP molecule, and two Mn2+ ions. Residues present in complex 1 are: molecule A (ϵ186) 6-159, 161-180 and molecule B (HOT) 2-76. Residues present in complex 2 are: molecule C (ϵ186) 6-180 and molecule D (HOT) 1-76. The final structure has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 2IDO. Structural alignments and r.m.s. deviations were done using Pymol (23DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Figures were made using Pymol (23DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) or using Molscript (24Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3D (25Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of θ in stabilizing the ϵ proofreading subunit, we have determined the crystal structure of the ϵ186-HOT complex in the presence of TMP, a product and competitive inhibitor of the exonuclease, and MnSO4 (Table 1). These crystals contain two ϵ186-HOT dimers in the asymmetric unit and diffract to a resolution of 2.1 Å. Each individual complex contains one molecule of ϵ186 and one molecule of HOT, in addition to one TMP molecule and two Mn2+ ions in the ϵ exonuclease active site. In the complex, ϵ186 adopts the familiar α/β structure of proofreading domains with the five-stranded twisted β-sheet surrounded by seven α-helices (Fig. 1A) (12Hamdan S. Carr P.D. Brown S.E. Ollis D.L. Dixon N.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 535-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). HOT in the complex is characterized by a three-helix bundle, as in solution (17DeRose E.F. Kirby T.W. Mueller G.A. Chikova A.K. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. Structure. 2004; 12: 2221-2231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), with an extensive hydrophobic core defined by residues on the three α-helices (Fig. 1A). The two ϵ186-HOT complexes in the unit cell are very similar; the 156 α-carbon atoms of the two ϵ186 molecules (listed as molecules A and C) superimpose with a r.m.s.d. of 0.4 Å, and 73 α-carbons of the two HOT molecules (listed as molecules B and D) superimpose with a r.m.s.d. of 0.4 Å as well. However, one area of discrepancy arises for the ϵ186 loop immediately preceding α7ϵ, a region of considerable interest because it includes the catalytically important H162ϵ residue (12Hamdan S. Carr P.D. Brown S.E. Ollis D.L. Dixon N.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 535-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In one molecule (molecule C), this loop is located away from the ϵ active site as residues Lys158-Leu161 form lattice contacts with residues Glu153-Asp155 from the other ϵ186 molecule (molecule A). Residues Lys158-Thr160 of molecule A are mostly disordered. This is demonstrated in Fig. 2, which shows the superposition of the crystal structures of the two molecules of ϵ186 in the asymmetric unit of the ϵ186-HOT complex (Fig. 2A).TABLE 1Crystallographic data statisticsData setϵ/HOT complexUnit cella = b = 77.29 c = 212.99 α = β = γ = 90°Space groupP4(3)2(1)2Resolution (Å)50-2.1No. of observations409,290Unique reflections37,506Rsym (%) (last shell)aRsym = Σ (|Ii – 〈I 〉|)/ Σ(Ii) where Ii is the intensity of the ith observation and 〈I 〉 is the mean intensity of the reflection8.1 (32.8)I/σI (last shell)17.5 (2.2)Mosaicity0.56Completeness (%) (last shell)97.3 (76.6)Refinement statisticsRcryst (%)bRcryst = Σ|| Fo| – | Fc ||/ Σ| Fo| calculated from working data set20.6Rfree (%)cRfree was calculated from 5% of data randomly chosen not to be included in refinement24.5No. of waters429Mean B value (Å)31.9R.m.s. deviation from ideal valuesBond length (Å)0.005Bond angle (°)1.2Dihedral angle (°)21.1Improper angle (°)0.68Ramachandran statisticsdRamachandran results were determined by MolProbity (33)Residues in: Favored (98%) regions (%)97.95 Allowed (>99.8%) regions (%)100a Rsym = Σ (|Ii – 〈I 〉|)/ Σ(Ii) where Ii is the intensity of the ith observation and 〈I 〉 is the mean intensity of the reflectionb Rcryst = Σ|| Fo| – | Fc ||/ Σ| Fo| calculated from working data setc Rfree was calculated from 5% of data randomly chosen not to be included in refinementd Ramachandran results were determined by MolProbity (33Lovell S.C.

First, a series of N-terminal HOT residues interact with ϵ186 strand β3 at the edge of the central β-sheet (Fig. 1B). These interactions include (i) hydrogen bonds from the backbone amides of W4HOT and N5HOT to the carboxylate group of E85ϵ; (ii) a pair of hydrogen bonds connecting the N5HOT amide side chain with the N47ϵ carbonyl oxygen and the H49ϵ backbone amide; (iii) the hydrogen bond from the backbone amide of I6HOT to the backbone carbonyl of H49ϵ; and (iv) a hydrophobic interaction of W4HOT with P77ϵ. There are also extensive water-mediated interactions between HOT residues of the C-terminal portion of helix α1, as well as the surrounding residues, with residues from the helix α1-loop-helix α2 region of ϵ186 (Fig. 1C). Additionally, there are hydrogen bonds between the R31HOT, D70ϵ, and E71ϵ side chains, and a stacking interaction of Y28HOT with F63ϵ. This latter interaction is facilitated by the insertion of the F63ϵ phenyl ring into a “notch” (26Liu W. Eilers M. Patel A.B. Smith S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in HOT helix α1 created by the lack of a side chain at G25HOT. Fig. 3 illustrates this stacking interaction with a stereo view of electron density in the region. The overall structure of ϵ186 in the complex is very similar to the previously determined structure of the TMP-complexed proofreading catalytic domain (12Hamdan S. Carr P.D. Brown S.E. Ollis D.L. Dixon N.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 535-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) obtained in the absence of θ or HOT as shown in Fig. 2B. The α-carbon atoms of ϵ186 molecule C superimpose with the reported structures (Protein Data Bank codes 1J53, 1J54) with a r.m.s.d. of 0.4 Å for 162 atoms and 0.4 Å for 161 atoms, respectively. In ϵ186 molecule A from the ϵ186-HOT complex, the proposed general base His162 and other atoms in the active site superimpose well with the ϵ186 structures in complex with TMP only. While one ϵ186 molecule (molecule A) in our structure appears to be in a catalytically relevant structure based on the position of His162, the other (molecule C) does not. Although the conformation of the loop in molecule C is stabilized by lattice contacts and a possible hydrogen bond to N18HOT, the inherent flexibility of this loop may be related to DNA substrate binding or regulation of catalysis. The central core three-helical bundle in HOT (residues 11-62) is structurally similar to that of the solution NMR structure (r.m.s.d. = 3.2 Å over 52 α-carbon atoms; Fig. 4A). The two HOT structures superpose fairly well along the two long α-helices (α1 and α3) but not in the N- and C-terminal regions and in the area of helix α2 (Asn33 to Gln45) and the loop preceding α2. Importantly, a novel additional helical structure is seen at the N terminus of HOT in the complex that was not observed in solution (17DeRose E.F. Kirby T.W. Mueller G.A. Chikova A.K. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. Structure. 2004; 12: 2221-2231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The extensive contacts in this region between HOT and ϵ186 indicate that this structure is probably strongly stabilized, if not induced, by the interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 1, B and C; Table 2). The published NMR structure of uncomplexed θ (13Mueller G.A. Kirby T.W. DeRose E.F. Li D.W. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7081-7089Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was also aligned with the HOT crystal structure (Fig. 4B), and again the termini deviate somewhat but the region of α2 aligns considerably better than that of HOT (r.m.s.d. of 1.3 Å for 49 α-carbon atoms in the region of residues 11-62 of HOT). Interestingly, reevaluation of the solution structure of HOT using the original nuclear Overhauser effect data and the program CYANA, version 2.1 (27Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar, 28Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

This work predicted the relative orientation and position of θ with respect to ϵ186 based on the observations of shift perturbations resulting from lanthanide ions bound to the active site of ϵ186 (14Keniry M.A. Park A.Y.

Because of the nature of the NMR experiment, however, the structure lacked data on the ϵ residues of the ϵ186-θ interface as well as detailed structural information for the C-terminal and N-terminal residues, which in the ϵ186-HOT complex appear to be critical for stable dimer formation. The published NMR structure of θ in complex with ϵ186 (14Keniry M.A. Park A.Y. Owen E.A. Hamdan S.M. Pintacuda G. Otting G. Dixon N.E. J.

Information as to how θ interacts with ϵ can be gained from the crystal structure of the ϵ186-HOT complex presented here. HOT and θ share 52% sequence identity and 61% similarity (Fig. 5A). Sequence alignments reveal that all the potential hydrogen bonding interactions between HOT and ϵ186 listed in Table 2 are likely to be conserved in the ϵ-θ complex with the exception of that formed by S64HOT. In particular, structural and sequence alignment of N5HOT with N4θ (Fig. 5A) allows preservation of the set of hydrogen bonding interactions shown in Fig. 1B. Additionally, hydrophobic interactions in the complex are also likely to be conserved, such as Y28HOT (F27θ) stacking with F63ϵ as well as the aliphatic side chain of K3θ substituting for the hydrophobic interaction of W4HOT with P77ϵ. The similarities in these important areas suggest that the ϵ186-HOT complex is a good model for the ϵ-θ complex. The structure of the ϵ186-HOT complex provides significant insight into the stabilizing role of HOT/θ on ϵ. First, formation of the HOT-ϵ186 complex removes 11% of the (mostly hydrophobic) ϵ186 surface area from solvent exposure. As ϵ is an intrinsically unstable protein, subject to proteolysis in vivo (29Foster P.L. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7509-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and aggregation and precipitation in vitro (11DeRose E.F. Li D.W. Darden T. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 94-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Hamdan S. Brown S.E. Thompson P.R. Yang J.Y. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Otting G. Dixon N.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), diminution of its hydrophobic surface is likely to be highly beneficial. Second, the interaction of the N-terminal HOT residues with ϵ186 strand β3 at the edge of the β-sheet must be considered a major stabilization factor, as unprotected edges of β-sheets generally represent adventitious interaction sites (31Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). As one example, the TREX2 nuclease, structurally very similar to ϵ186 (32Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McMillin S. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15212-15218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), overcomes the negative effects of the corresponding β-sheet edge by using this edge as a dimerization interface. Third, the interaction with HOT likely leads to specific stabilization of the ϵ186 (α1-α2) helix-loop-helix. This region is particularly important because it contains pertinent residues, e.g. His66, which line the substrate binding pocket (11DeRose E.F. Li D.W. Darden T. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Schaaper R.M. London R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 94-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Hamdan S. Carr P.D. Brown S.E. Ollis D.L. Dixon N.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 535-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); the dnaQ923 mutant (H66Y) is a proofreading-impaired mutant whose mutator phenotype is greatly exacerbated by the lack of θ or HOT (9Taft-Benz S.A. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2774-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Chikova A.K. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5528-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The present structure may provide a rationalization for several other dnaQ mutants with impaired proofreading capacity whose activity is negatively affected by the lack of θ or HOT (9Taft-Benz S.A. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2774-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Chikova A.K. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5528-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Many of the mutants (Fig. 6) involve residues located on the ϵ central β-sheet (Thr16, Arg56, Val96) or residues that interact directly with this sheet (Leu171). It is likely that destabilization of the central sheet presents a situation where stabilization of the outside edge by θ or HOT becomes increasingly critical. In addition, destabilization of ϵ by mutations of residues on helix α1 (His66) or of residues that interact with α1 (Gly17, Arg56) is also reversed/limited in the presence of θ/HOT, consistent with the proposed stabilization of this region by HOT. Finally, a notable aspect of the current structure is that it presents an example of a naturally occurring interspecies complex; as far as we know, it is the first such complex reported for a DNA replication assembly. Obviously, one interesting question is why bacteriophage P1 carries a homolog of θ while depending otherwise completely on the host replication machinery, as it carries no homolog for any other HE subunit (15Lobocka M.B. Rose D.J. Plunkett G. Rusin M. Samojedny A. Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7032-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Data from our laboratory have shown that the HOT gene product is expressed from the phage genome during both lytic and lysogenic stages and that HOT and θ compete for incorporation into the HE. 3R. M. Schaaper and A. Chikova, unpublished results. In view of the intrinsic instability of ϵ, it is possible that the amount of cellular θ is rate-limiting for incorporation of ϵ (or ϵθ) into the core. Thus, increased expression of the θ homolog from the phage may assure sufficient HE for phage replication. Addendum—After submission of this study, crystallographic structures have been reported for the DNA Polymerase III α subunits from E. coli (Lamers, M. H., Georgescu, R. E., Lee, S.

DnaK/Hsp70 chaperones comprise a major family of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones that facilitate protein folding and reactivation. These proteins participate in many cellular functions including DNA replication, protein degradation, protein translocation across membranes, and signal transduction (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

The co-chaperones DnaJ/Hsp40 and GrpE assist DnaK in protein folding to carry out these essential functions. DnaJ co-chaperones stimulate ATP hydrolysis by DnaK, thereby facilitating the binding of polypeptide substrates in the substrate-binding pocket of DnaK (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

All members of the DnaJ family contain a characteristic J-domain of ∼75 amino acids that interacts with DnaK as evidenced by its ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70/DnaK (5Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of J-domains are highly conserved and the structures of the Escherichia coli DnaJ J-domain as well as several other J-domains have been solved (6Hill R.B. Flanagan J.M. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All J-domains contain a conserved tripeptide (His, Pro, Asp) that is essential for co-chaperone activity and is located between two long α-helices. DnaJ proteins have been subdivided into classes based on their domain composition. Type I DnaJ proteins, including E. coli DnaJ, human Hdj2, and yeast Ydj1, contain four domains: An N-terminal J-domain, a glycine- and phenylalanine-rich region, a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like region, and a C-terminal region composed of two domains with similar folds (referred to as C-terminal domain I and II or CTD I and CTD II). 3The abbreviation used is: CTD, C-terminal domain. Crystallographic studies have shown that peptides are bound by CTD I (7Li J. Qian X. Sha B. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1475-1483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Type II DnaJ proteins, including E. coli CbpA, human Hdj1, and yeast Sis1, lack the zinc-binding domain, and unlike type I DnaJ proteins, they are not able to prevent aggregation of non-native polypeptides in the absence of DnaK (8Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 9Chae C. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Type III DnaJ proteins share with DnaJ only the J-domain and do not bind non-native proteins; this class is diverse and contains proteins with additional domains. CbpA is one of six DnaJ homologs in E. coli. It was originally identified based on its ability to bind curved DNA (named CbpA for “curved binding protein A” (11Ueguchi C. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)) and is one of the major nucleoid proteins in late stationary phase (12Ali Azam T. Iwata A. Nishimura A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its expression is regulated by σS and increases during entry into stationary phase as well as during phosphate starvation and growth at low pH (13Yamashino T. Kakeda M. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Tucker D.L. Tucker N. Conway T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6551-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A cbpA deletion mutant exhibits no growth defects, but a dnaJ, cbpA double deletion strain resembles dnaK deletion strains in being unable to grow below 16 °C or above 37 °C, and the double deletion strain is defective in cell division at permissive temperatures (15Ueguchi C. Shiozawa T. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3894-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When CbpA is expressed from a multicopy plasmid, it suppresses the phenotypes of dnaJ deletion and dnaJ, cbpA double deletion strains by restoring growth at high temperature and allowing phage λ and plasmid mini-F growth (11Ueguchi C. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Ueguchi C. Shiozawa T. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3894-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that CbpA is a functional homolog of DnaJ in vivo. Downstream from the cbpA gene and in the same operon, there is a small open reading frame, cbpM, which encodes a “CbpA modulator” (9Chae C. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33147-33153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CbpM shares some weak homology with DafA of Thermus thermophilus, a protein found to promote the assembly of a ring-like structure containing a trimer each of DnaKTth, DnaJTth, and DafATth (16Motohashi K. Yohda M. Endo I. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17343-17348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The role of DafATth in protein folding by DnaKTth has been explored, and the function of DafATth may be to hold DnaKTth and DnaJTth in an inactive state during non-stress conditions (17Klostermeier D. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Watanabe Y.H. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 339: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). CbpA functions as a DnaJ-like co-chaperone in vitro, acting in an ATP-dependent reaction with DnaK and GrpE to remodel inactive P1 RepA dimers into monomers active in DNA binding (9Chae C. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33147-33153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). CbpA, like DnaJ, forms a complex with RepA dimers, suggesting that CbpA binds native substrates and targets them for recognition and binding by DnaK (9Chae C. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33147-33153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CbpM interacts with CbpA and inhibits both the co-chaperone activity and the DNA binding activity of CbpA. CbpM is specific for CbpA, having no detectable effect on the co-chaperone activity of DnaJ or on DNA binding by other DNA-binding proteins (9Chae C. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33147-33153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study, we constructed CbpA substitution mutants and deletion mutants to identify the regions of CbpA involved in DNA binding and in CbpM interaction. Our results demonstrate that the region of CbpA essential for DNA binding is C-terminal to the J-domain and that the J-domain of CbpA interacts with CbpM. Plasmids—CbpA domain deletions were constructed by generating cbpA PCR fragments coding for CbpA(1-78), CbpA(1-201), CbpA(79-306), and CbpA(202-306) that contained 5′ and 3′ NdeI and HindIII sites, respectively, and lacked a terminal stop codon. The PCR fragments were digested with NdeI and HindIII and ligated into similarly digested pET24B (Novagen). CbpA site-directed mutants used in these studies were constructed in the cbpA plasmid (pCU60) (15Ueguchi C. Shiozawa T. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. J.

Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25296-25301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and CbpM (9Chae C. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33147-33153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were isolated as described previously. CbpA site-directed mutants described above were isolated using the procedures described for isolation of the wild type protein (11Ueguchi C. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CbpA domain deletions were isolated from BL21(DE3) cells harboring plasmids pETCbpA(1-78), pETCbpA(1-201), pETCbpA(79-306), or pETCbpA(202-306) described above. The cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.4 and then induced for 2 h with 1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The CbpA deletion mutants were isolated using Talon metal ion affinity chromatography resin (Clontech) as described by the manufacturer. All proteins were more than 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE. CD spectra of the site-directed substitution mutants were essentially identical that of wild type CbpA (data not shown). CD spectra of the domain deletions showed the presence of secondary structure indicative of protein structure (data not shown). Protein concentrations were expressed as molar amounts of RepA dimers, DnaK monomers, GrpE dimers, DnaJ dimers, CbpA monomers, and CbpM monomers. RepA was 3H-labeled in vitro using succinimidyl N-(2,3-3H) propionate (25Hoskins J.R. Pak M. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12135-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). pKO5R plasmid DNA containing the origin of replication of mini-P1 was 3H-labeled in vitro as described (20Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DNA Binding Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol (v/v)), 100 mm KCl, 0.005% Triton X-100 (v/v), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 9 fmol [3H]oriP1 plasmid DNA (2700 cpm/fmol), and 720 nm CbpA unless otherwise indicated. CbpM, where used, was added in amounts indicated in the figures. The mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 24 °C, filtered through nitrocellulose filters, and the retained radioactivity was measured. Chaperone Assay—To measure activation of RepA, reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained Buffer B, 1 mm ATP, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgOAc, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.005% Triton X-100 (v/v), 4 nm RepA, CbpA or CbpA mutant protein as indicated, 228 nm GrpE, and 430 nm DnaK. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 24 °C, then 13 fmol [3H]oriP1 DNA and 1 μg of calf thymus DNA were added. The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 0 °C, filtered through nitrocellulose filters, and the retained radioactivity was measured. Chemical Cross-linking—CbpA and CbpA deletion mutants were dialyzed against 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol (v/v). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 8.7 μm CbpA or CbpA mutant protein were incubated with or without 5 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) as indicated in Fig. 7 for 15 min at 24 °C. Reactions were stopped with 2 μlof1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue. CbpA-RepA Binding Assay—Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.005% Triton X-100 (v/v), 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 125 nm [3H]RepA (960 cpm/pmol), and CbpA or CbpA mutant protein as indicated. The reactions were incubated for 10 min at 23 °C and then centrifuged in 100,000 MWCO filters (Millipore, Microcon YM-100) at 2,700 × g for 12 min. Retentates containing CbpA·RepA complexes were recovered in 100 μl of 10% SDS, and the radioactivity measured. Comparison of CbpA to Other DnaJ Homologs and the Construction of Mutants—We wanted to identify the regions of CbpA that make CbpA a unique DnaJ homolog, namely the regions essential for CbpM interaction and those necessary for DNA binding activity. To gain information about the potential domain structure of CbpA, we aligned CbpA with DnaJ homologs from several organisms (Fig. 1A). The J-domain residues of CbpA (amino acids 1-78) are 55% identical and 78% similar to E. coli DnaJ J-domain and are also highly homologous to many other J-domains, including yeast Sis1 and Ydj1, Drosophila DroJ1 and human Hdj1, which are shown in Fig. 1A. A molecular model of the CbpA J-domain from residues 1-75 was generated with reference to the NMR structures of the J-domains of E. coli DnaJ and human Hdj1 (Fig. 1B). The C-terminal portion of CbpA from residue 118 to 306 was aligned with several type II DnaJ proteins: yeast Sis1, Drosophila DroJ1, and human Hdj1 (Fig. 1A). The crystal structure of Sis1 has been solved (26Sha B. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Structure. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and a molecular model could be generated, although the homology between the C-terminal domains of CbpA and Sis1 is not as high as between the J-domains (24% identity and 38% similarity) (Fig. 1B). Thus, this is only a model used to guide the construction of mutants and may not reflect accurately the structure of CbpA. The spatial relationship between the J-domain and the CTD I and CTD II domains is unknown because the structure of a full-length DnaJ family member remains to be solved. The 42 amino acid linker region of CbpA from amino acids 76 to 117 that connects the J-domain to the predicted CTD I did not align with any proteins of known structure and could not be modeled. This region is significantly smaller than the linker regions of Sis1, DroJ1, and Hdj1, which are 104, 81, and 86 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1A). In other DnaJ proteins, the linker region is typically rich in glycine and phenylalanine. In CbpA the linker contains only six phenylalanine residues as compared with 11 in Sis1 and DroJ1 and 12 in Hdj1. The CbpA linker contains only four glycine residues in contrast to 38 in Sis1 and 15 in DroJ1 and Hdj1. Thus, in some aspects CbpA is similar to other DnaJ homologs but in others it differs. We used the potential structural similarity between CbpA and other DnaJ homologs to design deletion mutants and site-directed substitution mutants for our studies. The mutants are shown in Fig. 2. CbpM Interacts with CbpA through the J-domain—We previously showed that CbpM, an 11-kDa protein, specifically interacts with CbpA, and as a result of the interaction, both DNA binding and co-chaperone activities of CbpA are inhibited (9Chae C. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33147-33153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine which domain of CbpA participates in the protein-protein interaction, we incubated CbpM with the domain deletions and then separated the protein species by native PAGE. When CbpA(J) and CbpM were incubated together and analyzed, a protein species appeared that migrated to a new position in the gel, distinct from the position of CbpM and CbpA(J) separately (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-3). Similarly the mixture of CbpM and wild type CbpA produced a protein complex that migrated on native PAGE distinct from either CbpM or CbpA (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5). To confirm that the new species seen following native PAGE contained both CbpA(J) and CbpM, the protein band was excised, eluted, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The results showed that the new species contained both proteins (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Quantification of CbpA(J) and CbpM in the complex is most consistent with a 1:1 ratio of CbpA to CbpM (data not shown). No complexes were detected between CbpA(L,CTDI,CTDII) and CbpM (data not shown). These results show that the J-domain is sufficient for CbpM interaction. To identify the region of the CbpA J-domain involved in CbpM interaction, we tested site-directed mutants. Using the rationale that CbpA, but not DnaJ, interacts with CbpM (Ref. 9Chae C. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33147-33153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and data not shown), several CbpA mutants were made in which DnaJ amino acids were substituted for the CbpA counterparts, including CbpA(D16A, D17E, L18E, K19R), CbpA(S57T, E59S, R61K), and CbpA(M68Y, W69G, Q70H, H71A) (shown in Fig. 2). These mutants were tested for CbpM interaction by native PAGE as described above. All of the mutants formed complexes with CbpM indistinguishable from complexes formed between wild type CbpA and CbpM (data not shown). Two other mutants in the J-domain, CbpA(H33Q) and CbpA(V36G, S37G, K38G), also formed complexes with CbpM. DNA binding activity of all of the J-domain mutants was inhibited by CbpM (data not shown), further showing that the CbpA-CbpM interaction site had not been inactivated. Taken together, the results show that the J-domain of CbpA interacts with CbpM, but the specific interacting residues remain to be identified. The Region C-terminal to the J-domain Is Required for DNA Binding—To identify the DNA-binding domain of CbpA, we tested the domain deletion mutants (Fig. 2, A and C) for their ability to bind DNA. CbpA(L,CTDI,CTDII) bound DNA with similar apparent affinity to wild type (Fig. 4A). CbpA(J,L,CTDI) retained some DNA binding ability; however, it exhibited 5-10-fold lower affinity for DNA than wild type (Fig. 4A). In contrast, CbpA(J) and CbpA(CTDII) had no detectable DNA binding activity (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that residues C-terminal to the J-domain are important for DNA binding. The linker region and CTD I are essential for DNA binding and CTD II contributes. None of the deletion mutants possessed detectable co-chaperone activity using an assay in which inactive RepA dimers are remodeled by DnaK, GrpE, and CbpA to active monomers that bind to labeled oriP1 DNA with high affinity (9Chae C. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33147-33153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Knowing that CbpM inhibits DNA binding by CbpA, a prediction from the observation that CbpA(L,CTDI,CTDII) binds DNA like wild type is that its DNA binding activity should not be inhibited by CbpM. Indeed, CbpM did not significantly inhibit DNA binding by CbpA(L,CTDI,CTDII) (Fig. 4C). Under the same conditions, CbpM inhibited DNA binding by full-length CbpA and by CbpA(J,L,CTDI) more than 90% (Fig. 4C). This observation confirms that CbpM interacts through the J-domain and that DNA binding activity is C-terminal to the J-domain. To further explore the DNA-binding domain, alanine substitution mutants were constructed in the region between 79 and 202 (Fig. 2, B and C). Interestingly, mutants with alanine substitutions in 87-90, 104-107, or 133-136 had two to five-fold lower DNA binding activity than wild type CbpA (Fig. 5A). Other mutants in this region, including CbpA(72-74), CbpA(77-80), CbpA(82-85), CbpA(156, 162), and CbpA(192, 194, 196) retained wild type DNA binding activity (Fig. 5B and Fig. 6B and data not shown). Together with the data from the deletion mutants, these results show that the linker region and CTD I are essential for DNA binding; CTD II plays a part in DNA binding; and specific residues between 87 and 136 are important.FIGURE 6Residues in CTD I involved in substrate binding.

CbpA-RepA binding experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 100,000 MWCO filters with [3H]RepA and wild type CbpA (blue circles), CbpA(104-107) (pink triangles), CbpA(192, 194, 196) (red squares), or CbpA(H33Q) (black squares). Results shown are means (±S.E.) of three or more experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA Binding Activity of CbpA Is Separable from Co-chaperone Function—We next asked whether the DNA binding function of CbpA is distinct from the co-chaperone function. The alanine substitution mutants, that were used above to identify residues important for DNA binding, were tested for co-chaperone function by measuring RepA activation. CbpA(104-107) and CbpA(133-136) retained wild type levels of co-chaperone activity, although they were defective in DNA binding (Fig. 5, C and A). CbpA(87-90) was defective in co-chaperone activity as well as DNA binding activity (Fig. 5, C and A). Other CbpA mutants in the 79-202 region that were active in DNA binding possessed wild type co-chaperone activity, including CbpA(77-80), CbpA(82-85), and CbpA(156, 162) (data not shown). Thus, some DNA binding defective mutants retain full co-chaperone activity pointing out that the two activities are separable and involve distinct amino acid residues. Substrate Binding Is Separable from DNA Binding—Next we tested whether the DNA binding site and substrate interaction site overlap. The location of the peptide binding site of a type II DnaJ homolog, Ydj1, is known from crystallographic studies (7Li J. Qian X. Sha B. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1475-1483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, the peptide binding site in yeast Sis1 has been identified by genetic and biochemical studies (10Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 27Lee S. Fan C.Y. Younger J.M. Ren H. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21675-21682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We made an alanine substitution mutant in CbpA in the region predicted to interact with substrates, amino acids Leu192, Leu194, and Ile196 (Fig. 2, B and C). When we tested the mutant protein in vitro, we found that it lacked detectable co-chaperone activity (Fig. 6A) but retained DNA binding activity (Fig. 6B). We directly measured the interaction of the CbpA(192, 194, 196) with RepA by incubating labeled RepA with wild type or mutant CbpA. Complexes were then collected by centrifugation through 100-kDa cut-off filters, and radioactivity in the retentates was measured. CbpA(192, 194, 196) bound RepA with ∼2-fold lower affinity than wild type CbpA (Fig. 6C). CbpA(H33Q), which has a mutation in the conserved tripeptide (His, Pro, Asp) and lacks detectable co-chaperone activity but binds DNA with similar affinity to wild type (Fig. 5B and data not shown), bound RepA with similar affinity to wild type (Fig. 6C). This observation is consistent with the known involvement of the conserved tripeptide in interaction with DnaK. CbpA(104-107), that has wild type levels of co-chaperone activity but is defective in DNA binding (Fig. 5, A and C), also bound RepA with similar affinity to wild type (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that CbpA(192, 194, 196) is partially defective in substrate binding. In summary, although both DNA binding and substrate interaction require participation of CTD I, the two activities involve different residues. CTD II Domain is Required for Dimerization—To identify the portion of CbpA that is involved in dimerization, chemical cross-linking experiments were performed. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, BS3, was reacted with the CbpA domain mutants, and then the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The results suggested that CbpA(CTDII) is a dimer (Fig. 7, lanes 8-9). CbpA(CTDII) migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 8.7 ± 0.4 kDa in the absence of cross-linking and 25.7 ± 1.0 kDa in the presence of cross-linking reagent. In agreement with this observation, the calculated molecular mass of the CbpA(CTDII) dimer is 25.7 kDa. The apparent molecular masses of CbpA(J) and CbpA(J,L,CTDI) did not change following BS3 treatment, suggesting that those mutants existed as monomers (Fig. 7, lanes 4-7). As a control, cross-linked CbpA migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa, whereas untreated CbpA migrated with a molecular mass of 35 kDa (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 3), consistent with the known dimeric structure of CbpA (9Chae C. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33147-33153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the dimerization domain is in CTDII. In combination with the results showing that CbpA(J,L,CTDI) binds DNA, this observation additionally demonstrates that CbpA monomers are able to bind DNA. We have identified regions of CbpA that make it a unique DnaJ homolog. The results from both the deletion mutants and site-directed mutants are compiled in Table 1. The following is a summary of our findings. (i) The CbpM interacting region is within the J-domain. This is somewhat surprising in that the J-domain is highly conserved between E. coli DnaJ and CbpA, yet CbpM interacts specifically with CbpA and not DnaJ. (ii) Residues essential for DNA binding are C-terminal to the J-domain, including the linker region and CTD I, with some contribution from CTD II. (iii) The co-chaperone, DNA binding, and CbpM interaction functions of CbpA are separable. (iv) Dimerization of CbpA is through CTD II. It is likely that the dimerization region is at the C-terminal portion of CTD II, as has been found for yeast Sis1 and E. coli DnaJ, where deletion of 15 and 45 amino acids, respectively, results in monomeric proteins (26Sha B.

The inhibition of CbpA by CbpM appears to be the direct result of the binding of CbpM to the J-domain of CbpA. This very likely interferes with the DNA binding site and explains the inhibition of DNA binding by CbpM. By binding to the J-domain, CbpM may also block the substrate binding site, the DnaK interaction site, or disrupt communication between the CbpA domains and thereby inhibit co-chaperone activity. Interestingly, in a diverse group of bacteria, including Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Coxiella burnetii, Streptomyces avermitilis, and Geobacter sulfurreducens, cbpM-like genes are downstream of dnaJ-like genes. This similarity in gene organization suggests that the mechanism of regulation of CbpA by CbpM is conserved. Thus, CbpM may well be the founding member of a new family of DnaJ regulators. The puzzle remains as to why genes for the effector and inhibitor proteins are co-transcribed. One could imagine that during part of the cell cycle, CbpA activity is kept in check by its physical interaction with CbpM. At other times, CbpA is activated for DNA binding and/or for co-chaperone activity perhaps by inactivation or degradation of CbpM. Another unique function of CbpA is its DNA binding activity and possible role in chromosome structure. The observation that residues in CTD I are involved in DNA binding and substrate interaction is consistent with the finding that the co-chaperone function of CbpA is not active in vitro when CbpA is bound to DNA (9Chae C. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33147-33153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results suggest that DNA binding occludes the substrate binding site or blocks communication between the domains and argues against a model in which DNA binding by CbpA recruits DnaK to act on protein·DNA complexes. In conclusion, this work provides new understanding of the biochemical properties of CbpA and its interaction with CbpM and DNA.

Despite the absence of the stomatin protein in these individuals, no mutations have been found in the stomatin gene (17Fricke B. Argent A.C. Chetty M.C. Pizzey A.R. Turner E.J. Ho M.M. Iolascon A. von During M. Stewart G.W. Blood. 2003; 102: 2268-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, a mouse knock-out for an SLP does not have red blood cell abnormalities (18Zhu Y. Paszty C. Turetsky T. Tsai S. Kuypers F.A. Lee G. Cooper P. Gallagher P.G. Stevens M.E. Rubin E. Mohandas N. Mentzer W.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2404-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that there is a second unknown gene that needs to be mutated to cause the loss of stomatin from red blood cells and to cause stomatocytosis. Recently, a variant of stomatocytosis with a neurological component was described (16Fricke B. Jarvis H.G. Reid C.D. Aguilar-Martinez P. Robert A. Quittet P. Chetty M. Pizzey A. Cynober T. Lande W.F. Mentzer W.C. During M. Winter S. Delaunay J. Stewart G.W. Br. J. Haematol. 2004; 125: 796-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to the red blood cell abnormalities and a lack of stomatin protein in red blood cells, affected individuals experienced mental retardation and seizures. A second human SLP, podocin, is mutated in autosomal recessive steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (6Boute N. Gribouval O. Roselli S. Benessy F. Lee H. Fuchshuber A. Dahan K. Gubler M.C. Niaudet P. Antignac C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). Because the pathogenic mechanisms of podocin-associated nephropathy and stomatocytosis are uncertain, investigating the multiple stomatin-like genes in Caenorhabditis elegans could assist in the understanding of these human conditions.There are 10 stomatin-like genes in C. elegans. Three stomatin-like genes, unc-1, unc-24, and mec-2, are expressed in neurons (19Barnes T.M. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Hekimi S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Huang M. Gu G. Ferguson E.L. Chalfie M. Nature. 1995; 378: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Rajaram S. Sedensky M.M. Morgan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mutations in neuronal stomatin-like genes unc-1 and unc-24 alter sensitivity to volatile anesthetics (VAs) (21Rajaram S. Sedensky M.M. Morgan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), linking stomatin function with a neuronal mechanism that has eluded description for 150 years. The current understanding of neuronal SLP function in C. elegans is limited to an association between SLPs and epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) (7Zhang S. Arnadottir J. Keller C. Caldwell G.A.

Physiol. 2004; 287: C468-C474Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The SLPs MEC-2 and UNC-24 have been shown to modulate functioning of the ENaCs involved in mechanosensation in C. elegans (7Zhang S. Arnadottir J. Keller C. Caldwell G.A. Yao C.A. Chalfie M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1888-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, the stomatin-like genes unc-1 and unc-24 have been shown to interact with the ENaC ortholog, unc-8 (22Sedensky M.M. Siefker J.M. Koh J.Y. Miller III, D.M. Morgan P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C468-C474Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Rajaram S. Spangler T.L. Sedensky M.M. Morgan P.G. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar stomatin and ENaC relationship has been observed in tissue-cultured mammalian cells expressing stomatin and a subset of ENaCs called acid-sensitive channels (24Price M.P. Thompson R.J. Eshcol J.O. Wemmie J.A. Benson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53886-53891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the role of stomatin in the normal functioning of sodium channels is unknown. Because the function of SLPs is unclear, we reasoned that identification of mutations that suppress loss of stomatin function might identify the role of SLPs.Here, we have explored the function of stomatins in the nematode C. elegans through studies of genes that interact with neuronal stomatin genes, unc-1 and unc-24. Of the 10 SLPs in C. elegans, we studied unc-1 and unc-24 because of their abnormal locomotion and their ability to modify sensitivity to VAs as measured by immobility (11Sedensky M.M. Siefker J.M. Morgan P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1340-C1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rajaram S. Sedensky M.M. Morgan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By studying genetic modifiers of neuronal stomatin mutants, we hope to better understand the function of stomatin-like genes, VA action, and conserved neuronal mechanisms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and General Methods—Basic genetic techniques and those for culturing C. elegans were as described by Brenner (25Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Williams et al. (26Williams B.D. Schrank B. Huynh C. Shownkeen R. Waterston R.H. Genetics. 1992; 131: 609-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular biology techniques were done by standard procedures except as noted. daf-5(e1386), daf-9(m540), daf-12(m20), daf-16(m27), daf-22(m130), unc-1(e580), unc-24(e138), unc-24(eDf28), and unc-79(ec1) were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center in Minneapolis, MN. ssu-1(fc73) was isolated as a suppressor of unc-1 using the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate (25Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nematodes were anesthetized as described previously (27Morgan P.G. Sedensky M. Meneely P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and EC50 values with standard deviations were calculated as described by Waud (28Waud D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1972; 183: 577-607PubMed Google Scholar). Nematodes were cultured, and all anesthetic experiments were performed at 20 °C. EC50 values were compared as a group using analysis of variance. Individual EC50 values were compared using a Student's t test with a Bonferroni correction.Crosses and Mapping—Preliminary single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis crossed ssu-1(fc73);unc-1(e580) into the polymorphic strain CB4856 (26Williams B.D. Schrank B. Huynh C. Shownkeen R. Waterston R.H. Genetics. 1992; 131: 609-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genotypes were determined by SNP analysis with differential restriction enzyme digests of PCR products or sequencing. These crosses placed ssu-1(fc73) at the end of chromosome V. For more refined mapping, ssu-1(fc73) was separately paired with neighboring marker genes unc-51(e369) and rol-9(sc148). The doubles with unc-1 were then crossed into CB4856 and recombinants that separated ssu-1(fc73) from the marker genes were collected (22 for unc-51 and 4 for rol-9). Selecting for the marker genes excluded CB4856 polymorphisms at the position of the marker genes but selected for CB4856 polymorphisms at the site of ssu-1(fc73). The recombination rates with the known positions of unc-51 and the SNPs placed ssu-1(fc73) at ∼20080 kb on chromosome V. Genes in the proximity of this site were sequenced. and a nonsense mutation (TGG→TGA) was found at 102754 of CEY113G7A (GenBank™ accession number AL132858) in predicted gene Y113G7A.11.To explore interactions with dauer larvae formation genes, crosses were used instead of the faster RNAi phenotypic investigations because of the variability of RNAi to affect phenotypes of some neuron-expressed genes (29Asikainen S. Vartiainen S. Lakso M. Nass R. Wong G. Neuroreport. 2005; 16: 1995-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). RNAi experiments were performed with multiple constructs targeting unc-24, ssu-1, and unc-1, but no changes in phenotype were seen. Because the neuronal sites of expression of unc-24, ssu-1, and unc-1 hinder RNAi efficacy, a lack of interaction between RNAi-targeted dauer-modifying genes and unc-24, ssu-1, and unc-1 mutants could be the result of failed RNAi targeting of dauer mutants. Crosses, although more time-consuming, guarantee genotype and strengthen the negative data such as the lack of observed interaction between dauer-modifying genes and the gene of interest.Microinjection—PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 vectors (Invitrogen). The promoter for the rescue and GFP constructs was amplified from DNA to include CEY113G7A 107,260 to 106,736 bp. Rescue constructs were amplified from cDNA for the two ssu-1 isoforms to include CEY113G7A 106,717 to 101,853 (3′ of the terminal stop). Promoters containing DNA and coding regions containing cDNA constructs were combined at the CEY113G7A 106,732 BbsI site. GFP constructs were designed with PCR primers that replaced the terminal stop, TAG at CEY113G7A 101,991, with GCA CCG GTC (underlined is an AgeI restriction digest recognition site). Using the AgeI restriction digest site, the constructs were inserted in-frame into pEGFP-1 vectors (BD Biosciences). Construct DNA was prepared with the Plasmid Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Mutant rescue was done as described by Mello et al. (30Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). The injected DNA is taken up by the developing oocytes and can form free linear arrays. “Rescued” is defined by the reversal of the phenotype of the gene of interest. Rescued progeny of unc-1(null) parents will move normally. Rescued progeny of ssu-1;unc-1(null) parents have uncoordinated locomotion. In general, the test DNA was injected at 10 μg/ml; a marker for successful microinjection, rol-6 DNA (pRF4, a plasmid containing the dominant rol-6(su1006) mutation), was coinjected at 100 μg/ml. F1 Rollers were picked to establish stable lines.Microscopy—Pictures of a single focal plane of animals were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped for fluorescence, using a Zeiss Axiocam digital camera.Amphid Staining—Amphid cells were stained using DiI dye (Michael Koelle, New Haven, CT). Briefly, a stock solution of 2 mg of DiI (Invitrogen) per 1 ml of dimethyl formamide was diluted 1:4000. Several worms were incubated in the diluted solution at room temperature for 1 h. Worms were then transferred to a normal growth medium plate to destain for 1 h. Stained worms were immobilized on agar pads with 1 mm levamisole for fluorescent microscopy using Texas Red filter.Protein Purification—cDNA for the three isoforms was cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). cDNA was inserted with a fusion at the amino start of the SSU-1 protein into pGEX-4T-2 protein expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) with BamHI/EcoRI, using BamHI that was incorporated in-frame into the 5′ primer and EcoRI of pCR2.1 vector. Constructs were transformed bl21 pLysS competent cells. To avoid inclusion bodies, the bacteria were grown at room temperature.Protein was purified using the Novagen Bugbuster GST·Bind purification kit (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) per the manufacturer's directions. Eluate was concentrated using a Millipore Microcon YM-50 Ultrafilter spin tube (Millipore, Billerica, MA). 4 μl of the concentrate was run in Fig. 3A. The sample was mixed to 50% glycerol and frozen at -20 °C. The GST tag was not removed.In Vitro Enzymatic Analysis—50-μl reactions contained 100 mm, pH 7.0, potassium phosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, 1 μm [35S]PAPS,0.1 mm 1-hydroxypyrene as an acceptor and 6 μl of enzyme glycerol mixture. 2-Hydroxy-β-cyclodextrin is used in the assay to optimize the reaction and is not targeted by the sulfotransferase. 2-Hydroxy-β-cyclodextrin is added to facilitate the exposure of the hydrophobic hydroxypyrene to the hydrophilic enzyme. Reactions were run at a nematode physiological temperature of 20 °C for 24 h to maximize formation of product. 5 μl of the reaction mixture was mixed with 10 μl of EtOH saturated with 1-hydroxypyrene as a visible marker. This mixture was spotted on a 250-μmKG silica gel 60-Å TLC plate and developed for 1 h with a solvent of chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/H2O, 8:2:4:2:1. Plates were then either sprayed with En3hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and placed on film, or lanes were scraped into Biosafe scintillation fluid, and the samples were read on a scintillation counter.RESULTSThe Genetic Suppressor ssu-1 Was Isolated as a Suppressor of the Unc-1 Locomotion Defect—Different alleles of the pan-neuronal SLP unc-1 (23Rajaram S. Spangler T.L. Sedensky M.M. Morgan P.G. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) disrupt coordination of locomotion in different patterns (25Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Park E.C. Horvitz H.R. Genetics. 1986; 113: 821-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alleles of unc-1 also have opposite effects on sensitivity to VAs. The dominant allele unc-1(n494) (31Park E.C. Horvitz H.R. Genetics. 1986; 113: 821-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) increases VA sensitivity (21Rajaram S. Sedensky M.M. Morgan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas the null allele unc-1(e580) suppresses the increased VA sensitivity caused by mutations in a second gene, unc-79(ec1) (27Morgan P.G. Sedensky M. Meneely P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To study the function of unc-1, we created genetic suppressors of unc-1(e580). unc-1(e580) has an uncoordinated locomotion phenotype (Supplemental videos) and also suppresses the increased halothane sensitivity of unc-79(ec1) (Fig. 1). We mutagenized unc-1(e580) with the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate and selected for genetic suppressors of the Unc-1 uncoordinated locomotion phenotype. Isolated as suppressors of the locomotion defect of unc-1, the gene class was given the name suppressor of stomatin uncoordination (ssu). One of the isolates, ssu-1(fc73), suppresses the altered VA sensitivities (Fig. 1) and locomotion defects of the neuronal SLP, unc-1(e580) (Fig. 1). ssu-1(fc73) also suppressed the locomotion (Supplemental videos) and VA sensitivities of the null allele unc-24(eDf28) (19Barnes T.M. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Hekimi S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Mutations in mec-2, which encodes a close homolog of unc-1, cause loss of the response to light touch in C. elegans. The double mutant ssu-1(fc73);mec-2(e75) is also defective in the response to light touch. Thus, ssu-1(fc73) is not a universal suppressor of SLP defects.FIGURE 1ssu-1(fc73) modifies volatile anesthetic sensitivity. The bars depict EC50 values in halothane as measured by immobility for several worm strains. Error bars show the standard deviation from the mean EC50 value. Fifty percent of wild type C. elegans are immobilized by 3.2% halothane. The sensitivity created by loss-of-function mutations in unc-79(ec1) can be suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in unc-1(e580) and unc-24(eDf28) (19Barnes T.M. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Hekimi S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Rajaram S. Sedensky M.M. Morgan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The triple mutants unc-79(ec1);ssu-1(fc73);unc-1(e580) and unc-79(ec1); unc-24(eDf28);ssu-1(fc73) have increased sensitivity as a result of ssu-1(fc73) suppressing the volatile anesthetic resistance of unc-1(e580) and unc-24(eDf28). Individually, unc-1(null), unc-24(null), and ssu-1(fc73) do not modify anesthetic sensitivity. *, EC50 value different from N2, p < 0.05; #, EC50 value different from unc-79(ec1), p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ssu-1 Suppresses a Newly Identified Dauer Modification Phenotype of unc-24 Nulls—unc-24 and ssu-1 are modifiers of dauer formation, an alternative developmental stage in C. elegans which allows larvae to survive adverse environmental conditions. Dauer larvae have distinctive morphologic characteristics and are capable of surviving several months longer than the normal 3-week life span of C. elegans at 20 °C. In normal laboratory growth conditions, N2 larvae bypass dauer formation in favor of the normal accelerated time-to-reproductive maturity developmental pathway. An increased incidence of dauer larvae to over 95% of offspring in normal growth conditions was found in a double mutant fc83;unc-24(eDf28) (Table 1). fc83 is an allele of a new synthetic dauer-constitutive gene mapped by us to chromosome III. By itself, fc83 does not cause the dauer phenotype nor does it fail to complement other known dauer-modifying genes on chromosome III. The unc-24(eDf28) deletion extends to include the neighboring gene ora-1 (19Barnes T.M. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Hekimi S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To support the dauer phenotype as unc-24-specific, the nonsense mutant unc-24(e138) was combined with fc83. The double mutant fc83;unc-24(e138) has a similar increase of greater than 95% dauer larvae. Unlike unc-24(e138) and unc-24(eDf28), unc-1(e580) does not interact with fc83 to increase dauer formation at 20 °C. This indicates that the effect on dauer formation is not a general one for neuronal SLPs. ssu-1(fc73) suppresses the dauer phenotype of fc83; unc-24(eDf28) so that less than 5% of offspring abnormally form dauer larvae (Table 1).TABLE 1The Fc83;Unc-24 dauer phenotype is suppressed by ssu-1(fc73) and daf-12(m20) The propensity to form dauer larvae was observed in the following animals. The phenotype was defined as “Dauer” if greater than 95% of the animals form dauer larvae in normal growth conditions at 20 °C. The phenotype was defined as “Not dauer” if less than 5% of the animals form dauer larvae in the same conditions. 95% of fc83;unc-24(e138) and fc83;unc-24(eDf28) worms form dauer larvae. The dauer phenotype is not a result of the kinked phenotype in combination with fc83 as is shown by the lack of dauers in the fc83;unc-1(e580) double mutant. The dauer-defective mutants daf-5(e1386), daf-16(m27), and daf-22(m130) do not change the propensity of fc83;unc-24(eDf28) to form dauer larvae. Both daf-12(m20) and ssu-1(fc73) suppress dauer larvae formation of fc83;unc-24(eDf28) such that less than 5% of offspring form dauer larvae. fc83;unc-24(eDf28) double mutants display a distinctive quality of dauer larvae formation in which a small portion of dauer larvae escape to reproductive adulthood after periods of 24 h to over 6 months. Of other dauer-defective mutations, the 1–2-day transient constitutive dauer formation of daf-9(m540) mutants most closely resembles the Fc83;Unc-24 phenotype. Despite this similarity, neither unc-24(eDf28) nor ssu-1(fc73) was observed to affect the occurrence or duration of the Daf-9 dauer larvae formation phenotype.DauerNot Dauerfc83; unc-24(eDf28)fc83daf-5(e1386); fc83; unc-24(eDf28)unc-24(e138)daf-16(m27); fc83; unc-24(eDf28)unc-24(eDf28)daf-22(m130); fc83; unc-24(eDf28)fc83; unc-24(eDf28); daf-12(m20)fc83; unc-24(eDf28); ssu-1(fc73)fc83; unc-1(e580) Open table in a new tab A developmental pathway consisting of multiple genes controlling dauer formation has been characterized (32Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. Caenorhabditis elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 739-768Google Scholar). fc83;unc-24(eDf28) displays a distinctive quality of dauer larvae formation in which a small portion of larvae escapes to reproductive adulthood after periods of 24 h to over 6 months. For other dauer-defective mutations, the 1-2-day transient constitutive dauer formation of daf-9(m540) mutants most closely resembles the Fc83;Unc-24 phenotype. Neither ssu-1(fc73) nor unc-24(eDf28) affected the duration of transient constitutive dauer formation when paired with daf-9(m540) (Table 1). To further determine the role of ssu-1 in dauer formation, we created triple mutants of multiple dauer-defective mutations with fc83;unc-24 to determine the position of fc83;unc-24 within the dauer pathway. The dauer-defective daf-12(m20), which occupies a terminal position in this pathway, suppresses the dauer phenotype of fc83;unc-24(eDf28) so that less than 5% of offspring abnormally form dauer larvae. No other dauer-modifying mutations were found to interact with fc83, unc-24, or ssu-1 (Table 1). Sterols have been shown"

The functional unit of the ion pump is comprised of two mandatory subunits including the α-subunit, which mediates ATP hydrolysis and ion translocation, as well as the β-subunit, which acts as a chaperone to promote proper membrane insertion and trafficking in the plasma membrane. To examine the conformational dynamics between the α- and β-subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase during ion transport, we have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer, under voltage clamp conditions on Xenopus laevis oocytes, to differentiate between two models that have been proposed for the relative orientation of the α- and β-subunits. These experiments were performed by measuring the time constant of irreversible donor fluorophore destruction with fluorescein-5-maleimide as the donor fluorophore and in the presence or absence of tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide as the acceptor fluorophore following labeling on the M3-M4 or M5-M6 loop of the α-subunit and the β-subunit. We have also used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to investigate the relative movement between the two subunits as the ion pump shuttles between the two main conformational states (E1 and E2) as described by the Albers-Post scheme. The results from this study have identified a model for the orientation of the β-subunit in relation to the α-subunit and suggest that the α- and β-subunits move toward each other during the E2 to E1 conformational transition.

A series of crystal structures showing different conformational states of a highly homologous P-type ATPase, the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), 4The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide; FM, fluorescein-5-maleimide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; D, donor; A, acceptor.4The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide; FM, fluorescein-5-maleimide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; D, donor; A, acceptor. has provided insight into the structure of the Na+/K+-ATPase as well as the conformational flexibility of the pump during ion translocation (8Toyoshima C. Nakasaki M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 9Toyoshima C. Nomura H.

It has been demonstrated through these structures that the SERCA pump undergoes significant conformational changes during ion transport. However, as the SERCA pump is comprised of only the α-subunit, no information is available about the involvement of the β-subunit in the conformational flexibility of the Na+/K+-ATPase. Direct structural information of the β-subunit has been limited to electron microscopy studies (13Hebert H. Purhonen P. Vorum H. Thomsen K. Maunsbach A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 479-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Rice W.J. Young H.S. Martin D.W. Sachs J.R. Stokes D.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2187-2197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The results from these experiments have proposed a putative location for the β-subunit in relation to the α-subunit. However, this model is inconsistent with some biochemical experiments, and alternative structural models have been proposed (2Jørgensen P.L. Hakansson K.O. Karlish S.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 817-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 15Hasler U. Crambert G. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16356-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as the electron microscopy study yields a static representation of the ion pump, it is difficult to elucidate the relative movements of the α- and β-subunits during ion translocation. Voltage clamp fluorometry has been recognized as a powerful technique to monitor the conformational dynamics of ion channels (16Mannuzu L.M. Moronne M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Science. 1996; 271: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 17Cha A. Bezanilla F. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1127-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 18Cha A. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The method has also been extended to determine distance constraints and the relative movement between protein subunits that accompany gating of the Shaker potassium channel and the human glutamate transporter using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (19Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Glauner K.S. Mannuzu L.M. Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Nature. 1999; 402: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 21Cha A. Snyder G.E. Selvin P.R. Bezanilla F. Nature. 1999; 402: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that small scale movements between subunits accompany channel gating. Our laboratory has previously utilized voltage clamp fluorometry to demonstrate that residues on the α- and β-subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase can be site-specifically labeled with the fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide (TMRM). Fluorescence changes that are induced by changes in membrane potential and/or ion concentrations (Na+ and/or K+) can be correlated to the two main conformational states, E1 and E2 (Fig. 1A), of the Na+/K+-ATPase (22Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To examine the interaction between the α- and β-subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase, we have now used voltage clamp fluorometry to determine distance constraints between the α- and β-subunits (Fig. 1B). We have also investigated the relative movement between the α- and β-subunits proximal to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane as the ion pump shuttles between the two principle conformational states as described by the Albers-Post scheme, E1 and E2 (24Albers R.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1967; 36: 727-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 25Post R.L. Kume S. Hegyvary C. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results from this study have identified the orientation of the β-subunit in relation to the α-subunit and the relative movement of the two subunits during ion transport. Molecular Biology, Oocyte Preparation, and cRNA Injection—cDNAs of sheep Na+/K+-ATPase α1-subunit with no extracellular cysteine residues (with mutations C911S and C964A) (26Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and reduced ouabain sensitivity (with mutations Q111R and N122D) (27Price E.M. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) for the selective inhibition of the endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase as well as the sheep β1-subunit were subcloned into vector pTLN as described (22Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Oocytes were obtained by collagenase treatment after partial ovarectomy from Xenopus laevis females and were injected with 25 ng of α-subunit and 1 ng of β-subunit cRNA, which was prepared using the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). After injection, oocytes were kept in oocyte Ringer's buffer (90 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4) containing 1 mg/ml gentamycin at 18 °C for 4-6 days before measurements. Oocyte Pretreatment and Fluorescence Labeling—Immediately before measurements, oocytes were incubated for 45 min in loading buffer (110 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm sodium citrate, and 10 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4) and 15 min in post-loading buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, and 10 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4) to elevate the intracellular Na+ concentration (28Rakowski R.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 117-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cysteine-specific fluorescence labeling was achieved by incubating Na+-loaded oocytes in post-loading buffer containing fluorescein-5-maleimide (FM), and/or TMRM (Invitrogen) for 30 min on ice in the dark followed by washes in dye-free buffer. For single-fluorophore labeling experiments, the oocytes were incubated in 5 μm the appropriate fluorophore. For double-fluorophore labeling experiments, the oocytes were incubated with 1 μm FM and 4 μm TMRM. At this fluorophore ratio and assuming that each fluorophore reacts with cysteine at the same rate, it is predicted that an ion pump with two cysteine residues will be labeled pairwise at the following proportion: 4% FM:FM (D:D), 32% FM:TMRM (D:A), and 64% TMRM:TMRM (A:A). For the subsequent donor photobleaching experiments, the predominant measured species will be the FM:TMRM pair as the TMRM:TMRM pair will be excluded through the usage of the correct filters (described below). However, there will be a small population of ion pumps that are labeled with two donor fluorophores. This population will induce a faster observed decay rate, and therefore, the distance measurements could be slightly under-calculated. Measurements for TMRM under Na+/Na+ exchange conditions were performed in Na+ test solution (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm NiCl2, 10 μm ouabain, and 10 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4) with continuous solution flow. FM measurements, under Na+/Na+ exchange conditions, were performed in Na+ test solution without NiCl2. For stationary pump current recordings, 10 mm NaCl was replaced with an equimolar amount of KCl. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Epifluorescence Measurements—An oocyte perfusion chamber was mounted on the stage of a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop 2FS, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a ×40 water immersion objective (numerical aperture: 0.8). Currents were measured using a twoelectrode voltage clamp amplifier CA-1B (Dagan Instruments, Minneapolis, MN). Fluorescence was excited by a 100-watt tungsten lamp. Solution flow was constant to eliminate artifacts arising from a light-induced temperature change. The following optical filter components were used: TMRM (525AF45 excitation filter, 565ALP emission filter, and 560DRLP dichroic mirror), FM (475DF40 excitation filter, 530DF30 emission filter, and 505DRLP dichroic mirror), and FRET (475AF40 excitation filter, 595AF60 emission filter, and 505DRLP dichroic mirror) (all filters were obtained from Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). Fluorescence was measured with a PIN-022A photodiode (United Detector Technologies, Baltimore, MD) mounted to the microscope camera port. Photodiode signals were amplified by a patch clamp amplifier EPC-5 (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht Germany). Fluorescence and current signals were simultaneously recorded and subsequently analyzed with Clampex 8.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Origin 7.5 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA), respectively. FRET and Anisotropy Measurements—For FRET distance measurements, oocytes expressing the Na+/K+-ATPase with two cysteine residues (one on both the α- and the β-subunits) were labeled with FM and/or TMRM as described previously in this report. Expression of the construct was verified with stationary pump current recordings, and the rate of donor photobleaching was monitored following illumination. The results of 4-6 oocytes were averaged, and the traces were usually fit to a monoexponential function. In some cases, traces were best fit by a biexponential function where the time constant corresponding to the fast component was used and the slow time constant was only a small fraction of the total decay (20Glauner K.S. Mannuzu L.M. Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Nature. 1999; 402: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The origin of the smaller slow component is unknown. However, it could be due to a diffusion process on the plasma membrane of the oocyte. To determine the efficiency of energy transfer (E), the following equation was used: E = 1-τDA/τD (where τDA and τD are the time constants of donor photobleaching in the presence and the absence of acceptor, respectively) (29Forster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4870) Google Scholar). FRET efficiency was converted to distance using the Förster equation: E = 1/(1+ R6/Ro6), where R is the distance between the donor and acceptor and Ro is the distance corresponding to 50% efficiency for a specific donor-acceptor pair (29Forster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4870) Google Scholar). Ro is defined by the equation:(R0=(9.7×103JΦDn−4κ2)1/6 (in Å), where J is the normalized spectral overlap of the donor emission and acceptor absorption, ΦD is the donor emission quantum yield in absence of the acceptor, n is the index of refraction, and κ2 is the orientation factor for a dipole-dipole interaction (30Van Der Meer B.W. Coker G. Chen S.Y.D. Resonance Energy Transfer: Theory and Data. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). The anisotropy (r, Fig. 1C) of the donor and acceptor fluorophores was measured on the oocytes, which represent a quasiplanar system, and evaluated through the use of the following equation: r = (I∥ - I⊥)/(I∥ + 2I⊥), where I∥ is the parallel and I⊥ is the perpendicular-emitted light with respect to the polarized excitation light at each amino acid (31Dale R. Eisinger J. Blumberg W. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 161-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 32Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 395-424Crossref Google Scholar). The two components were measured sequentially with polarized filters (Linos Photonics, Inc., Göttingen, Germany) placed adjacent to the emission and excitation filters. To calculate the error in the distance measurements due to anisotropy, the following equations were used: κ2max = 2/3(1 + Frd + Fra + 3Frd × Fra) and κ2min = 2/3(1 - (Frd + Fra)/2) where Frd = (rd/ro)0.5 and Fra = (ra/ro)0.5 ; rd is the anisotropy of FM, ra is the anisotropy of TMRM, and ro is the fundamental anisotropy of each fluorophore (FM: 0.4 and TMRM: 0.38) (18Cha A. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 33Chen R.F. Bowman R.L. Science. 1965; 147: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Expression and Labeling Experiments—Our group has shown that following single-cysteine mutagenesis on the M5-M6 loop of the α-subunit and on the transmembrane-cytosolic interface of the β-subunit, the ion pump is active, and that the stationary currents can be directly attributed to the ouabain-insensitive form of the Na+/K+-ATPase (22Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen.

Additional single- and double-cysteine constructs of the Na+/K+-ATPase that contained a cysteine mutation on the M3-M4 loop or doublecysteine mutants (one cysteine mutation on both the α- and the β-subunits) were examined for activity. Functional expression was demonstrated by measuring stationary pump currents upon the addition of 10 mm K+ in two-electrode voltage clamp experiments in the presence of 10 μm ouabain to inhibit the endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase of the oocytes. All constructs were functional and produced currents similar to the cysteineless construct, which gave the same results as the ouabain-insensitive wild-type construct (Fig. 1D). Each construct could also be largely inhibited upon the application of 10 mm ouabain (not shown). Complete inhibition cannot be achieved by 10 mm ouabain because of the half-maximal inhibition value (∼2mm) for the ouabain-resistant Na+/K+-ATPase used in these studies (34Horisberger J.D. Kharoubi-Hess S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 669-680Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the transport activity could be directly attributed to the ouabain-resistant Na+/K+-ATPase constructs (27Price E.M. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Intermolecular FRET Analysis—Fluorescence labeling of specific residues of the Na+/K+-ATPase has previously provided insight into the conformational dynamics of the ion pump during the transport cycle where the fluorescence intensity can be correlated to the conformational state of the ion pump and the kinetics of fluorescence change can be compared with ion transport across the plasma membrane (22Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our current aim, however, is to investigate the relative conformational dynamics between the α- and β-subunits of the ion pump by labeling both subunits with fluorophores and monitoring changes in FRET. Our first objective, therefore, was to determine whether there was significant FRET between two α-subunits or two β-subunits of the ion pump in the Xenopus oocyte plasma membrane. The results from this experiment would answer two questions. First, it would provide insight into the α/β-stoichiometry of the Na+/K+-ATPase in the plasma membrane, and second, it would determine whether the measurement of distance constraints between the α- and β-subunits would be feasible as a large intermolecular FRET component, between two α-subunits or two β-subunits, would complicate data analysis. Therefore, three single-cysteine constructs, αT309C (located on the extracellular loop between M3 and M4 on the α-subunit), αN790C (located on the extracellular loop between M5 and M6 on the α-subunit), and βS62C (located adjacent to the transmembrane domain on the β-subunit) were selected for labeling. It has previously been shown that the conformational state of the ion pump can be monitored following labeling with TMRM at each of these sites during solution exchange (with Na+ or K+) and/or voltage-pulses (22Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Zifarelli G. Geibel S. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 268AGoogle Scholar). These constructs were concurrently labeled with the donor fluorophore (FM) and the acceptor fluorophore (TMRM). Energy transfer was analyzed by measuring the change in intensity of the acceptor fluorophore following excitation of the donor fluorophore under Na+/Na+ exchange conditions. These conditions enable precise regulation of the two main conformational states of the ion pump by controlling the membrane potential of the cell (36Nakao M. Gadsby D.C. Nature. 1986; 323: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In these experiments, we are not directly investigating the conformational state of the protein; instead, the change in fluorescence intensity is identifying whether the donor fluorophore is close to the acceptor fluorophore. Preliminary experiments have established that following FM labeling of αT309C, αN790C, and βS62C, changes in fluorescence were observed during shifts in membrane potential (not shown). Therefore, when two cysteine residues are labeled with FM and TMRM and they are within the Förster radius, a change in FRET intensity would be observed during voltage pulses. These results from the single-cysteine constructs were compared with the emission of the acceptor fluorophore when the double-cysteine constructs αT309C/βS62C and αN790C/βS62C were labeled with both donor and acceptor fluorophores. The single-cysteine constructs, with a stationary current of greater than 100 nA, demonstrated low levels of FRET, where the total change of fluorescence for these constructs was equal to or less than 0.5% of the total fluorescence (Fig. 2, A-C). In contrast, the double-cysteine (one cysteine mutation on both the α- and the β-subunits) constructs, with a stationary current of greater than 100 nA, exhibited fluorescence changes that were greater than 3% (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, there is only a low amount of energy transfer between α-α- or β-β-subunits in the oocyte expression system. The observed residual FRET response for the single-cysteine mutant constructs is most likely due to the high density of ion pumps on the cell surface, which causes a small population of ion pumps to be within the Förster radius in the plasma membrane. In contrast, the double-cysteine constructs display a significant α-β energy transfer component, and therefore, the results from this experiment do not support the presence of a dimeric or higher order structure of the Na+/K+-ATPase in the plasma membrane of the Xenopus oocyte. Therefore, it is possible to measure distances between the α- and β-subunits. Anisotropy Measurements—Uncertainties in anisotropy and subsequent κ2 calculations can lead to errors in the estimation of Ro for a donor/acceptor pair since residues that exhibit significant polarized emission can affect the amount of energy transfer between the donor and acceptor fluorophores, and therefore, influence the distance measurements, which are derived from irreversible fluorophore bleaching measurements (32Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 395-424Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the relative mobility of FM and TMRM was determined using polarized filters under Na+/Na+ exchange conditions (Fig. 1C). At each of the residues examined, both fluorophores were highly mobile. Following the subsequent calculation of κ2, the range of κ2 for the αT309C/βS62C double mutant was 0.4-1.5, whereas the range for the αN790C/βS62C double mutant was determined to be 0.4-1.6. As the anisotropy measurements indicated that all of the residues had a reasonable mobility, κ2 was assumed to be 2/3 (18Cha A. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Glauner K.S. Mannuzu L.M. Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Nature. 1999; 402: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ro was estimated for the FM/TMRM pair to be 55 Å (20Glauner K.S. Mannuzu L.M. Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Nature. 1999; 402: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Our group has demonstrated that specific residues labeled with TMRM undergo fluorescence changes as a function of solution exchange, but it has remained unknown whether the fluorescence changes are the result of a change of the environment surrounding the fluorophore or are the result of a reorientation of the fluorophore (22Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Dempski R.E. Friedrich T. Bamberg E. J. Gen.

To examine the relative orientation of the fluorophores, polarized light was used to excite TMRM in the E1 (K+ external solution) and E2 (Na+ external solution) conformation. The amount of parallel and perpendicular emitted light was measured with polarized filters (Fig. 1C). No significant change in polarized emission was observed at any of three residues labeled with FM or TMRM in the E1 or E2 conformation. Therefore, the difference in the intensity of fluorescence following solution change is not the result of a change in anisotropy. The change in fluorescence is the result of a change in environment of the fluorophore. Intersubunit FRET Analysis—To determine distance constraints between the α- and β-subunits, ion pumps that contained two cysteine mutations, one on both the α- and the β-subunits, were concurrently labeled with the donor (FM) and acceptor (TMRM) fluorophores (αT309C/βS62C or αN790C/βS62C). To determine distances between two residues, the time dependence of donor bleaching was measured following labeling with the donor (FM) fluorophore in the presence or absence of the acceptor (TMRM) fluorophore. The observed photodestruction rate of the donor fluorophore depends on the donor cumulative excited lifetime. On a single-molecule level, the donor, when not paired to an acceptor fluorophore, has a long excited state lifetime, and therefore, on the macroscopic scale, photobleaches at a relatively fast rate (16Mannuzu L.M. Moronne M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Science. 1996; 271: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The excited state lifetime of the donor fluorophore is shortened in the presence of an acceptor fluorophore due to energy transfer, which allows the donor, on a single-molecule level, to undergo more excitation cycles before photodestruction and which subsequently yields a slower macroscopic photobleaching. Furthermore, donoracceptor pairs that are close together demonstrate a slower photodestruction rate of the donor fluorophore in the presence of the acceptor fluorophore when compared with a set of fluorophore-labeled residues that are farther apart (20Glauner K.S. Mannuzu L.M. Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Nature. 1999; 402: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 21Cha A. Snyder G.E. Selvin P.R. Bezanilla F.

The difference between the rate of the irreversible photodestruction of the donor fluorophore in the presence and absence of the acceptor fluorophore can be used to calculate the di"

Although the physiological function of PrP, if any, remains obscure, it may be that the maintenance of this polymorphism results from the selective pressure of prion diseases. There is evidence that the polymorphism affects susceptibility to sporadic (3Palmer M.S. Dryden A.J. Hughes J.T. Collinge J.

Most strikingly, M129V heterozygotes appear to be relatively protected from sporadic, inherited, and infectious prion diseases in these studies. Balancing selection in the face of recurrent prion disease epidemics, such as that experienced by the Fore people of Papua New Guinea (in whom the frequency of heterozygotes is particularly high) has been suggested to account for the maintenance of the polymorphism (10Mead S. Stumpf M.P. Whitfield J. Beck J.A. Poulter M. Campbell T. Uphill J.B. Goldstein D. Alpers M. Fisher E.M. Collinge J. Science. 2003; 300: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), although recent analysis suggests that this is unlikely to be a general explanation (11Soldevila M. Calafell F. Helgason A.

However, until recently, no plausible molecular mechanism to explain these clinical findings could be provided. In particular, the thermodynamic stability of the physiological α-monomeric form of PrP was not affected by the polymorphism (12Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 13Hosszu L.L. Jackson G.S. Trevitt C.R. Jones S. Batchelor M. Bhelt D. Prodromidou K. Clarke A.R. Waltho J.P. Collinge J.

To address this question, we have investigated the possibility that the polymorphism at position 129 might affect the alternative pathways of in vitro folding of recombinant PrP, schematized in Fig. 1, that were first elegantly demonstrated by Baskakov et al. (16Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). These authors show that, in mildly denaturing conditions, acidic pH favors the formation of soluble β-oligomers (which we designate βO), whereas neutral pH favors the formation of β-sheet-rich multimers (designated βM, corresponding to multimer I of Ref. 16Baskakov I.V.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) that go on to form possibly infectious amyloid fibrils (17Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.O. Riesner D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 2004; 305: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). They also show that βO cannot form βM without previously dissociating to a monomeric form (16Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Using this system, we have been able to detect potentially significant differences in behavior of the allelomorphs of human PrP. For example, we showed that the oligomerization pathway (Fig. 1, pathway 2) is favored by the presence of a methionine residue at position 129 (18Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Conversely, the amyloid pathway (Fig. 1, pathway 4) is favored by the presence of a valine residue at position 129 (19Baskakov I. Disterer P. Breydo L. Shaw M. Gill A. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2589-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In both of these cases, however, the properties of mixtures of Met-129 and Val-129 were intermediate between those of the respective homogenous populations, shedding little light on the presumed behavior of PrP in heterozygous individuals. In the present work we investigated the possibility that the M129V polymorphism affects pathway 5 (Fig. 1; the formation of βM and hence amyloid from βO). This process is very much slower than the rate of conversion of the physiological form, α1, to amyloid under equivalent conditions. More strikingly, the rate of amyloid formation is more than 5-fold slower from βO comprising an equimolar mixture of Met-129 and Val-129 variants than from homogeneous βO of either variant. Given the stability of βO and its resistance to conversion to the self-propagating amyloid form of PrP, we speculate that the entrapment of misfolded PrP in βO, if it were to occur in vivo, might prevent the appearance of βM and thereby reduce the incidence of prion disease. The peculiar stability of βO, comprising a mixture of the Met-129 and Val-129 forms of PrP, is therefore a form of molecular heterosis that might plausibly provide a basis for selection in vivo that would maintain the polymorphism. Preparation of Soluble β-Oligomers (βO)—Expression and purification of the two human PrP variants were done as described previously (18Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The formation of βO was carried out as follows. 1 ml of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride-denatured disulfide-oxidized protein (30 mg/ml) was dialyzed overnight at room temperature against 2 liters of 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.2m NaCl, pH 3.7, 2 m urea by using a Slide-A-Lyser dialysis cassette (Perbio Science UK Ltd., Tattenhall, UK) with cutoff at 10 kDa. After dialysis, the three oligomers were further purified by a size exclusion chromatography column (TSK®-Gel SWXL G3000 HPLC column, 7.8 × 300 mm, Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK), equilibrated in 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 3.7, 1 m urea, and 0.02% sodium azide (18Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The final step in the preparation of the three oligomers was the concentration through 10-kDa cutoff Microcon filters. The oligomers were kept at room temperature and showed exceptional stability (18Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). (Note that the oligomeric form induced in disulfide-reduced PrP, which seems to be a component of in vitro generated amyloid fibrils (20Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33477-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).) Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD spectra were recorded in the oligomer buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 3.7, 1 m urea, 0.02% sodium azide) using a Jasco-720 spectrometer at room temperature at around 35 μm protein concentration using the following parameters: cell path 0.1 cm, speed 55 nm/s, bandwidth 1.0 nm, resolution 0.5 nm, and response time 4 s. Four individual scans were averaged, and the buffer spectra were subtracted. Analytical HPLC—Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a C4 column (Sephasil C4, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Amersham Biosciences). The elution was done with a linear gradient of H2O +0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 95% acetonitrile +0.09% trifluoroacetic acid over 25 min. Size-exclusion HPLC was performed as described above. All HPLC separations were performed at room temperature with a flow rate of 1 ml/min by means of a PerkinElmer HPLC system composed of a binary LC pump 250 and a diode array detector 235C controlled by Total Chrome software, version 6.2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), through a PerkinElmer Nelson 600 series link. The eluent was monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm and size-exclusion HPLC. The areas under the peaks were determined with Total Chrome software 6.2, and the data were then analyzed by GraphPad Prism software using nonlinear regression curve fitting. Asymmetric Flow, Field-flow Fractionation (FlFFF) and Light Scattering Analysis of βO—This was done as described previously (23Silveira J.R. Raymond G.J. Hughson A.G. Race R.E. Sim V.L. Hayes S.F. Caughey B. Nature. 2005; 437: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) using an Eclipse F separation system (Wyatt Technology Europe). The channel was 26.5 cm in length and 350 μm in height, constructed with a trapezoidal spacer of maximal width 21 mm at the inlet, and lined with a 10-kDa cutoff polyether sulfone membrane at the accumulation wall. The sample was loaded in one 20-μl injection and then eluted with 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.6, 1 m urea, 0.01% sodium azide at a channel flow of 1 ml/min and a cross-flow of 2 ml/min over 40 min. Static light scattering, refractive index, and dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out on DAWN EOS, Optilab DSP, and WyattQELS instruments, respectively (Wyatt Technologies), and UV absorbance was measured with a Waters 486 tunable absorbance detector. All instruments were connected in line with the FlFFF system. Weight average molar weight (MW) and z-average hydrodynamic radius ((rh)z) values were calculated using ASTRA analysis software (version 4.90.07). Amyloid Reaction and Thioflavin T Assay—A time course study of amyloid formation from the oligomeric forms of recombinant human PrP90-231 allelomorphs was carried out as described previously (16Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) by monitoring thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. Briefly, the oligomers were diluted to a final concentration of 35 μm in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 3 m urea, 0.02% sodium azide, and a final concentration of 1 m guanidine hydrochloride. Samples were incubated at 37 °C under continuous shaking at 600 rpm on a Delfia plate shaker in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The kinetics of amyloid formation were analyzed as described previously (19Baskakov I. Disterer P. Breydo L. Shaw M. Gill A. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2589-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Formation of amyloid was confirmed by negative stain electron microscopy as described previously (19Baskakov I. Disterer P. Breydo L. Shaw M. Gill A. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2589-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Slot-blot Analysis—The conformationally specific prion aptamer SAF-93 (24Rhie A. Kirby L. Sayer N. Wellesley R. Disterer P. Sylvester I. Gill A. Hope J. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. J. Biol.

The α-monomeric form of PrP was prepared as described previously (14Tahiri-Alaoui A. James W. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The individual fractions from size-exclusion HPLC, corresponding to βM, ψ1, and βO (see above and under “Results” for details), were manually collected and immediately applied onto a PVDF membrane. Two hundred pmol of PrPs in each form were applied by vacuum onto a PVDF membrane (0.2 μm pore size) previously equilibrated in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.4, using a Bio-Dot® SF microfiltration apparatus. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h in 15 ml of blocking solution containing 5× Denhardt's solution in HMNK buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl) and 20 μg/ml tRNA at room temperature. The blocking solution was replaced with a fresh one supplemented with 700,000 cpm of radiolabeled and refolded SAF-93 or control aptamer 247.7 and allowed to incubate overnight at 25 °C inside a hybridization oven under constant rolling. The membrane was then washed twice with 15 ml of HMNK buffer, pH 7.2, wrapped inside Saran film and exposed to a storage phosphor screen overnight, and then scanned with the Storm imaging system. The autoradiographs were analyzed with ImageQuant software from GE Healthcare. After radioactive detection with the SAF-93 prion aptamer, the PVDF membrane was probed with an anti-His antibody (Sigma) followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and detected with enhanced chemifluorescence substrate (ECF, Amersham Biosciences) using the chemiluminescent mode on the Storm imaging system from GE Healthcare. Preparation and Characterization of Soluble β-Oligomers—All recombinant human PrP forms used in this study were prepared and purified following the procedure that we described previously (18Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We prepared soluble β-oligomers (βO) of Met-129, Val-129, and an equimolar mixture of the two by dialysis following the procedure that we described previously (18Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We reasoned that these three types of βO should mimic potential PrP states in Met/Met and Val/Val homozygous and Met/Val heterozygous individuals, respectively. Secondly, we used a range of analytical techniques to compare the biophysical properties of the three oligomers (Fig. 2). Size-exclusion HPLC indicated that they had indistinguishable hydrodynamic volume (Fig. 2A). Circular dichroism analysis revealed typical β-sheet spectra with a single minimum at around 218 nm for all three (Fig. 2B). We had previously shown that oligomers undergo a maturation process during the course of several weeks that can be detected by reversed-phase HPLC. This maturation is more rapid for Met-129 than for Val-129 (18Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Accordingly, to ensure that all three oligomers had reached the same maturation stage at the time of the initiation of amyloid reaction, we analyzed them by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 2C). All three βO preparations had similar retention times, indicating comparable maturation states. To determine whether βO comprised a monodisperse population, we used asymmetric FlFFF. This technique was used recently to determine biophysical parameters of the most infectious prion protein particles (23Silveira J.R. Raymond G.J. Hughson A.G. Race R.E. Sim V.L. Hayes S.F. Caughey B. Nature. 2005; 437: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Oligomers composed of Met-129, Val-129, or both Met-129 and Val-129 eluted as a single peak between 4 and 8 min into the 40-min elution time (see Fig. 2D) in contrast to the broad polydispersity seen with multimeric components of infectious PrPSc (23Silveira J.R. Raymond G.J. Hughson A.G. Race R.E. Sim V.L. Hayes S.F. Caughey B. Nature. 2005; 437: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the trailing edge of the oligomer peak indicated the possibility that the fraction might contain more than one species. Accordingly, multi-angle light scattering analysis was used to determine the molecular weight and hydrodynamic radius of each of the species within the peak. The intensity of light scattering depends on both the concentration of monomer and the size of the oligomer, as subunits of an oligomer scatter light coherently. Between 5 and 7 min of elution, corresponding to at least 70% of the oligomer peak, the in-line scattering-based estimate of mass remained flat (see Fig. 2D). This fraction of all three oligomers appeared to have a mass of ∼200 kDa by the refractive index method and 210 kDa by the UV method (see Table 1); the latter method is likely the less accurate of the two, given its dependence on a calculated, rather than measured, molar extinction coefficient. This suggests that the bulk of the oligomer comprises 10 subunits, given that the molecular mass of our recombinant PrPs is 19.6 kDa (18Tahiri-Alaoui A. Gill A.C. Disterer P. James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31390-31397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with a minor fraction comprising larger species. The major oligomer species had a hydrodynamic radius of ∼5.6 nm (see Table 1). These experiments were conducted on four separate occasions, with essentially identical results.TABLE 1Biophysical properties of soluble PrP β-oligomersMet-129Val-129Met-129/Val-129MW ± S.D.

A common feature of amyloid, in contrast with βO, is its ability to bind dyes such as ThT (26Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Gryczynski Z. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The rapid binding of ThT to amyloid is accompanied by an increase of fluorescence at 482 nm, when excited at 455 nm. Accordingly, we transferred βO to the conditions that favor amyloid formation (namely, moderate denaturation in a pH-neutral buffer with agitation) and monitored the process using the ThT binding assay as described previously (14Tahiri-Alaoui A. James W. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Baskakov I. Disterer P. Breydo L. Shaw M. Gill A. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2589-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The formation of amyloid from both Met-129 βO and Val-129 βO showed a characteristic nucleation-dependent polymerization pattern, as measured by ThT fluorescence, but with an unusually extended initial lag phase of about 80 h followed by a rapid growth phase (Fig. 3). The absence of any obvious difference in the kinetics of amyloid formation for the two homogeneous oligomers indicated at first that there was no effect of the polymorphism at codon 129 on this pathway. However, when we mimicked heterozygote condition by initiating amyloid formation from preformed βO that contained Met-129 and Val-129 proteins at equimolar ratio, the lag phase of amyloid formation was extended by more than 5-fold to around 450 h (Fig. 3). To test whether this heterosis effect depended on the presence of both Met-129 and Val-129 species within the same oligomer, we repeated the experiment using an equimolar mixture of two preformed, homogeneous βO preparations (Fig. 3). The amyloid reaction showed a lag phase of ∼110 h, a value very close to that seen during amyloid formation with the two separate, homogeneous βO preparations. These experiments were undertaken on two separate occasions, with four replicates in each experiment. The ThT data were confirmed by extensive negative stain electron microscopy (for illustration, see supplemental Fig. S1). In summary, all samples that were ThT-positive showed the presence of fibrils (of increasing length and topological complexity at greater time points and higher fluorescence), whereas all ThT-negative samples showed no significant structures (data not shown). These results indicate that the effect of the polymorphism at codon 129 is mediated through an interaction between the two allelomorphs within the same oligomer. Heterogeneous Oligomers Dissociate Slowly—Interestingly, despite the very substantial difference in lag phase, the rate of amyloid growth following nucleation seemed to be very similar (Fig. 3). This suggests that the heterosis effect is entirely restricted to events occurring before nucleation, the most tractable of which is oligomer dissociation. We were able to take advantage of the solubility of βO and its well defined elution in size-exclusion HPLC (see Ref. 16Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) to monitor its behavior during amyloid reaction in parallel with ThT assay (Fig. 4A). Detailed chromatograms are provided as supplementary data (supplemental Fig. S2). The dissociation of βO to a species with retention time corresponding to monomeric protein (designated ψ1) followed by the appearance of amyloidogenic βM is consistent with published results (16Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the kinetics of dissociation of oligomers appeared to be linear, rather than exponential, and was almost 100-fold slower for the heterogeneous βO than for either homogeneous βO (Fig. 4B). Correspondingly, ψ1 peaked at 2 h in the homogeneous amyloid reactions but only after 430 h in the heterogeneous reaction (Fig. 4C). The preamyloid multimer species (βM) reached half-maximal abundance at between 5 and 6 h in the case of homogeneous reactions but was delayed until about 460 h with the heterogeneous oligomer (Fig. 4D). Nevertheless, following the lag phase, the rate of multimer formation in all reactions was very similar (Fig. 4D). These experiments were undertaken on two separate occasions, with four replicates in each experiment. These results indicate that the rate-limiting step of amyloid formation from βO is the dissociation of βO to ψ1. This dissociation reaction is extremely slow for the mixed oligomer as compared with the two homogeneous oligomers, suggesting that the former is locked in a particularly stable conformation and explaining the heterosis effect noted above. Is the Transient Monomer Abnormally Folded?—We wished to know whether the apparently monomeric form, ψ1, which transiently appears upon dissociation of βO and which multimerizes to form βM, is the same as the physiologically normal form, α1 or is itself abnormally folded. To investigate this question, we took the opportunity to use simple sizeexclusion chromatographic fractionation under native conditions to isolate the pathway species, βO, ψ1, and βM, and investigate their conformation with a structure-sensitive probe. Although formed with very different kinetics from homogeneous versus heterogeneous βO (see above), the chromatographic profiles of the respective ψ1 and βM species were consistent (see Fig. 4A). We have previously described a 2′F-substituted RNA aptamer, SAF-93, that binds to PrP in a structure-sensitive manner (24Rhie A. Kirby L. Sayer N. Wellesley R. Disterer P. Sylvester I. Gill A.

James W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13102-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A specific binding site for SAF-93, C-terminal to PrP residue 110, is occluded in the α-monomeric, physiological form but exposed in PrPSc and denatured PrP (24Rhie A. Kirby L. Sayer N. Wellesley R.

An additional nonspecific nucleic acid-binding site in the N terminus of PrP also binds SAF-93. We used this reagent to probe the conformation of the transient monomer (ψ1) identified above. The amyloid reactions from the homogeneous and heterogeneous oligomers were timed in a way that would allow near simultaneous fractionation of the dissociating intermediates. The corresponding peaks were manually collected and immediately analyzed by slot blot using 32P-labeled SAF-93 aptamer (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Equal protein loading of each fraction was assured by detection of the C-terminal His tag on all PrP allelomorphs using an anti-His antibody (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Following quantification, no significant allelomorph-dependent differences were detected (data not shown), but the conformation-specific aptamer-binding site was equally exposed in the βM and βO forms (Fig. 5B). As expected, α1 was poorly reactive to SAF-93, but ψ1 showed intermediate SAF-93 aptamer binding (Fig. 5B) that was significantly higher than that of α1 (p < 0.05, unpaired t test). The results, obtained in two independent series of experiments, suggest that ψ1 is not in the same conformation as the physiological α1 and retains a degree of misfolding present in the abnormal forms.

https://openalex.org/W2139379484,"α-Phosphoglucomutase (α-PGM) plays an important role in carbohydrate metabolism by catalyzing the reversible conversion of α-glucose 1-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate. Isolation of α-PGM activity from cell extracts of Lactococcus lactis strain MG1363 led to the conclusion that this activity is encoded by yfgH, herein renamed pgmH. Its gene product has no sequence homology to proteins in the α-d-phosphohexomutase superfamily and is instead related to the eukaryotic phosphomannomutases within the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily. In contrast to known bacterial α-PGMs, this 28-kDa enzyme is highly specific for α-glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate and showed no activity for mannose phosphate. To elucidate the function of pgmH, the metabolism of glucose and galactose was characterized in mutants overproducing or with a deficiency of α-PGM activity. Overproduction of α-PGM led to increased glycolytic flux and growth rate on galactose. Despite several attempts, we failed to obtain a deletion mutant of pgmH. The essentiality of this gene was proven by using a conditional knock-out strain in which a native copy of the gene was provided in trans under the control of the nisin promoter. Growth of this strain was severely impaired when α-PGM activity was below the control level. We show that the novel L. lactis α-PGM is the only enzyme that mediates the interconversion of α-glucose 1-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate and is essential for growth. α-Phosphoglucomutase (α-PGM) plays an important role in carbohydrate metabolism by catalyzing the reversible conversion of α-glucose 1-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate.

Phosphoglucomutase (PGM 3The abbreviations used are: PGM, phosphoglucomutase; HAD, haloacid dehalogenase; TEA, triethanolamine; BisTris propane, 1,3-bis(tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino)propane; Fru-1,6-P2, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; PMMs, phosphomannomutases. ; EC 5.4.2.2) is widespread in living organisms from bacteria to humans (1Whitehouse D.B. Tomkins J. Lovegrove J.U. Hopkinson D.A. McMillan W.O. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It plays various roles in carbohydrate metabolism by catalyzing the reversible conversion of α-Glc-1-P to Glc-6-P. In higher organisms, its major function is mediating the mobilization of sugar moieties from energy reserves. Also, α-PGM activity is essential for the synthesis of UDP-glucose, a sugar donor for the production of glucose-containing polysaccharides. Therefore, PGM is a crucial link between catabolic and anabolic processes. Lactococcus lactis is used worldwide in the industrial manufacture of fermented milk products. The organism converts sugars primarily into lactic acid, thus providing an efficient means of food conservation. In L. lactis, PGM is assumed to be essential for the utilization of galactose via the Leloir pathway (2Grossiord B. Vaughan E.E. Luesink E. de Vos W.N. Lait. 1998; 78: 77-84Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and for the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides and exopolysaccharides (3Delcour J. Ferain T. Deghorain M. Palumbo E. Hols P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 76: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 4Kleerebezem M. van Kranenburg R. Tuinier R. Boels I.C. Zoon P. Looijesteijn E. Hugenholtz J. de Vos W.M. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 76: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In a number of Gram-positive bacteria, pgm mutants show altered cell wall morphology and altered polysaccharide production as well as growth defects on glucose (5Hardy G.G. Magee A.D. Ventura C.L. Caimano M.J. Yother J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7Levander F. Radstrom P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2734-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of knowledge on sugar metabolism of L. lactis (8Neves A.R. Pool W.A. Kok J. Kuipers O.P. Santos H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 531-554PubMed Google Scholar), genes coding for α-PGM have not been identified in this organism. More than 1 decade ago, the presence of two distinct PGM activities in L. lactis ssp. lactis with specificity for α- and β-anomers of phosphoglucose was reported (9Qian N. Stanley G.A. Hahn-Hagerdal B. Radstrom P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 28-kDa protein (designated β-PGM) was shown to catalyze the reversible conversion of β-Glc-1-P to Glc-6-P. L. lactis β-PGM, which belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily (10Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8351-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Zhang G. Dai J. Wang L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Tremblay L.W. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9404-9416Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), is a catabolic enzyme in the pathway for maltose and trehalose degradation encoded by a gene (pgmB) in the trehalose operon (13Levander F. Andersson U. Radstrom P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Andersson U. Levander F. Radstrom P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42707-42713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A larger protein (∼65 kDa) showing affinity for the α-anomer of Glc-1-P was partially purified (9Qian N. Stanley G.A. Hahn-Hagerdal B. Radstrom P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α-specificity and protein size, which matched the analogous parameters of bacterial α-PGMs, led to the conclusion that it was the lactococcal α-PGM. Thus far, all α-PGMs described belong to the α-d-phosphohexomutase superfamily of proteins (1Whitehouse D.B. Tomkins J. Lovegrove J.U. Hopkinson D.A. McMillan W.O. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Shackelford G.S. Regni C.A. Beamer L.J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2130-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a BLASTp search of the available L. lactis genome sequences (14Bolotin A. Wincker P. Mauger S. Jaillon O. Malarme K. Weissenbach J. Ehrlich S.D. Sorokin A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 731-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar) 4U. Wegmann, M. O'Connell-Motherway, A. Zomer, G. Buist, C. Shearman, C. Canchaya, M. Ventura, A. Goesmann, M. J. Gasson, O.

Kok, unpublished data. using members of the α-d-phosphohexomutase superfamily as query or a domain search using the highly conserved regions of proteins in this family retrieved only FemD, a protein tentatively annotated as a phosphoglucosamine mutase. In this work, we report the identification, purification, expression, and characterization of L. lactis α-PGM and its encoding gene pgmH (previously know as yfgH) and show that this activity is essential for growth. To our knowledge, lactococcal α-PGM is the first member of the HAD superfamily of proteins with strict specificity for α-Glc-1-P. Microbial Strains and Growth Conditions—The strains and plasmids used throughout this study are listed in Table 1. For molecular biology procedures, L. lactis strains were cultivated as batch cultures (flasks) without aeration in M17 medium (Difco) containing 0.5% (w/v) glucose at 30 or 38 °C. For physiological studies, L. lactis NZ9000 (17Kuipers O.P. de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 64: 15-21Crossref Scopus (576) Google Scholar) derivatives NZ9000(pNZ8048) (control strain), NZ9000(pNZ8048-pgmH) (hereafter designated NZ9000(pgmH+)), and NZ9000ΔpgmH-(pgmH+) were grown in chemically defined medium at 30 °C under anaerobic conditions at pH 6.5 as described previously (18Neves A.R. Ramos A. Costa H. van Swam I.I. Hugenholtz J. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 6332-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Glucose or galactose was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v). Plasmid selection was achieved by the addition of chloramphenicol (5 mg/liter) or erythromycin (5 mg/liter). For overproduction of α-PGM, nisin (1 μg/liter) was added at A600 = 0.5. For studies in which the nisin-inducible conditional mutant NZ9000ΔpgmH(pgmH+) was used, cells were grown in M17 medium containing different levels of nisin and washed once with fresh M17 medium lacking nisin. The cultures were subsequently subcultured for 15 h in fresh medium with or without nisin (0.01-1 μg/liter).TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this study Cmr, chloramphenicol-resistant; Emr, erythromycin-resistant.DescriptionRef.StrainMG1363Plasmid-free and prophage-cured derivative of NCDO71223Gasson M.J.

(19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal and plasmid DNAs were isolated from L. lactis according to Johansen and Kibenich (20Johansen E. Kibenich A. Plasmid. 1992; 27: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Birnboim (21Birnboim H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), respectively. L. lactis was transformed with plasmid DNA by electroporation as described by Holo and Nes (22Holo H. Nes I.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47: 195-199PubMed Google Scholar). All DNA modification enzymes were purchased from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). PCRs were performed using Expand DNA polymerase and purified with a Roche PCR purification kit. Primers (listed in supplemental Table 1SM) were purchased from Biolegio BV (Malden, The Netherlands). Construction of Strains and Plasmids—The genes pgmH and galE were cloned and overexpressed in L. lactis strain NZ9000 as follows. The coding regions of pgmH and galE were amplified by PCR using primer pairs yfgH-fw/yfgH-rev and galE-fw/galE-rev. The 0.76-kb RcaI/XbaI and 0.98-kb RcaI/SpeI fragments were digested with the indicated enzymes and cloned into NcoI/XbaI- or NcoI/SpeI-digested pNZ8048 (17Kuipers O.P. de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 64: 15-21Crossref Scopus (576) Google Scholar), yielding constructs pNZ8048-pgmH and pNZ8048-galE, respectively. The femD gene was amplified using primer pair femD-fw/femD-rev. The pNZ8048-femD overexpression plasmid was constructed by cloning the 1.36-kb NcoI/XbaI PCR product into similarly digested pNZ8048. The resulting construct was transformed into L. lactis strain NZ9000. L. lactis MG1363 DNA (23Gasson M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as template for all PCRs. Several strategies were employed to construct an L. lactis ΔpgmH strain. A complete deletion of the pgmH gene was tried by using a two-step homologous recombination method as follows. The upstream and downstream flanking regions of pgmH were obtained by PCR using primer pairs yfgH-KO1/yfgH-KO2 and yfgH-KO3/yfgH-KO4 and cloned as EcoRI/BamHI and BamHI/XbaI restriction fragments into pORI280 (24Leenhouts K. Buist G. ten Bolhuis A. Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pORI280ΔpgmH. The plasmid was obtained and maintained in L. lactis LL302 (25Leenhouts K. Bolhuis A. Venema G. Kok J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 49: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). pORI280ΔpgmH and pVE6007 (26Maguin E. Duwat P. Hege T. Ehrlich D. Gruss A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5633-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) were cotransformed into NZ9000, and this strain was taken through the temperature shift protocol for single and double crossovers (24Leenhouts K. Buist G. ten Bolhuis A. Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). No double crossover transformants were obtained in M17 medium supplemented with following sugars at 0.5%: glucose, maltose, and trehalose or a mixture of trehalose (0.5%) and galactose (0.05%). In a second approach, a 0.46-bp fragment containing the 5′-end of pgmH except for 2 bp was amplified by PCR using primers yfgH-fw1 and yfgH-rev1, double-digested with EcoRI/XbaI, and cloned into similarly digested pORI13 (27Sanders J.W. Venema G. Kok J. Leenhouts K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was transformed into NZ9000, but despite several attempts, no erythromycin-resistant colonies were obtained. Subsequently, pNZ8048-pgmH was introduced in NZ9000:: pORI280ΔpgmH, obtained as explained above. The resulting chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistant strain was subjected to an excision strategy (24Leenhouts K. Buist G. ten Bolhuis A. Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) in M17 medium containing glucose and nisin (0.1 μg/liter), yielding NZ9000ΔpgmH(pgmH+). The addition of nisin was required to induce expression of pgmH from pNZ8048-pgmH. Integration of plasmids in the chromosome and deletions were confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting. Probe labeling, hybridization, and detection were performed using the ECL direct nucleic acid labeling system (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Enzyme Assays—Enzymes were assayed at 30 °C after disruption of a cell suspension by passage through a French press (twice at 120 megapascals). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216607) Google Scholar). Routinely and during enzyme purification, α- and β-PGM activities were assayed as described by Qian et al. (9Qian N. Stanley G.A. Hahn-Hagerdal B. Radstrom P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were started by the addition of 1.5 mm α-Glc-1-P or β-Glc-1-P, respectively. Purification of Native α-PGM from L. lactis—All steps were performed in the presence of 0.5 mm EDTA and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. Cell extracts were prepared from 135 g (wet weight) of galactose-grown MG1363 cells that were suspended in 50 mm triethanolamine (TEA) buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5 mm MgCl2. Precipitation steps with protamine sulfate (0.25%, w/v) and solid ammonium sulfate were performed as described by Qian et al. (9Qian N. Stanley G.A. Hahn-Hagerdal B. Radstrom P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitate in the range of 45-85% (NH4)2SO4 saturation was dissolved in 50 mm TEA buffer (pH 7.2) containing 30 mm KCl and dialyzed against the same buffer. The sample was applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column in 20 mm BisTris propane (pH 6.9) containing 45 mm KCl, and α-PGM activity was detected in the flowthrough fractions. Active samples were loaded onto a Resource Q column in the same buffer, and elution was carried out with a linear gradient of KCl (45-500 mm). Active fractions (which eluted at ∼240 mm KCl) were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) containing 4 mm MgCl2 and 1.6 m (NH4)2SO4. The sample was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column, and elution was carried out with a linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (1.6 to 0 m). The positive fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm TEA buffer (pH 7.5) and 30 mm KCl and loaded onto a Superose 6 gel filtration column. α-PGM activity was measured in the flowthrough fractions. Two putative target proteins of 28 and 37 kDa were excised from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the amino acid sequences of their N termini were determined (29Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Open reading frames encoding the two proteins were identified by BLASTp searches using the genome sequence of L. lactis ssp. lactis IL1403. Purification and Characterization of Recombinant α-PGM— The protein was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from ∼65 g (wet weight) of glucose-grown nisin-induced NZ9000(pgmH+) cells. A purification strategy similar to that used for the native enzyme was followed, except that the Superdex 200 gel filtration column was replaced with an anion-exchange Q-Sepharose column in 20 mm BisTris propane (pH 6.9) with a 45-500 mm KCl gradient, and the last chromatographic step (gel filtration) was not required. Also, the hydrophobic step (phenyl-Sepharose) preceded the anion-exchange step (Resource Q). The purified protein was stored at -20 °C in TEA buffer. The pH profile was determined in TEA buffer at a range of 4-9. The effect of alternative cations (Ni2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, and Li+) at 1 or 5 mm was examined in the presence of 50 μm Mg2+. ATP and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) were examined as potential inhibitors of α-PGM. Kinetic constants were determined in the reaction direction α-Glc-1-P → Glc-6-P. The Vmax for the direction Glc-6-P → α-Glc-1-P and substrate specificity were determined by 31P NMR spectroscopy. The 3-ml reaction mixtures contained 50 mm TEA buffer (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm Glc-1,6-P, 3% (v/v) 2H2O, and 20 μg of pure enzyme. For substrate specificity, spectra were acquired before and after 3 h of incubation at 30 °C in the presence of the following compounds at 7.5 mm: α-Glc-1-P, Glc-6-P, β-Glc-1-P, GlcN-1-P, GlcN-6-P, α-Man-1-P, Fru-1-P, Fru-6-P, Fru-1,6-P2, Fru-1,6-P2/α-Glc-1-P, α-Gal-1-P, Gal-6-P, Rib-5-P, ribulose-5-P, 6-phosphogluconate, UDP-Gal, and UDP-Glc. For Vmax determinations, the reactions were started by the addition of Glc-6-P (50 mm), and the time course for its consumption was monitored. Methyl phosphonate was added as an internal concentration standard. Molecular mass was determined by gel filtration on a Superose 12 10/300 GL column using 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 7.0). Determination of Extra- and Intracellular Metabolites during Growth—Samples (2 ml) of NZ9000(pNZ8048) or NZ9000-(pgmH+) cultures growing in chemically defined medium containing either glucose or galactose were collected at different points during growth. Fermentation substrates and products were quantified as described (30Neves A.R. Ramos A. Shearman C. Gasson M.J. Santos H. Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 3467-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ethanol extracts for analysis by 31P NMR and quantification of phosphorylated metabolites in NZ9000(pgmH+) and control strains at mid-exponential growth phase were prepared as described (31Ramos A. Boels I.C. de Vos W.M. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Assignment of resonances and quantification of phosphorylated metabolites were based on previous studies (31Ramos A. Boels I.C. de Vos W.M. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or determined by adding the suspected, pure compounds to the NMR sample extracts. The values reported for intracellular phosphorylated compounds are the averages of two independent growth experiments, and the accuracy was ∼15%. NMR Experiments and Quantification of Metabolites—Cells were harvested during the mid-logarithmic growth phase (A600 = 2.2), centrifuged, washed twice, and resuspended to a protein concentration of 16.5 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium Pi buffer (pH 6.5). In vivo NMR experiments were performed as described (18Neves A.R. Ramos A. Costa H. van Swam I.I. Hugenholtz J. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 6332-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Spectra were acquired sequentially prior to and after the addition of [1-13C]glucose or [1-13C]galactose. After substrate exhaustion and when no changes in the resonances due to end products and intracellular metabolites were observed, a total NMR sample extract was prepared and used for quantification of end products and other metabolites (32Neves A.R.

Hugenholtz J. de Vos W.M. Almeida J. Santos H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 64: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Correction factors to convert peak intensities into concentrations for Gal-1-P (0.73), α-Glc-1-P (0.73), UDP-Gal (0.67), and UDP-Glc (0.67) were determined using NMR sample extracts supplemented with the pure compounds as described (32Neves A.R. Ramos A. Shearman C. Gasson M.J. Almeida J.S. Santos H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3859-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra of living cells were run at 30 °C as described by Neves et al. (18Neves A.R. Ramos A. Costa H. van Swam I.I. Hugenholtz J. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 6332-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although individual experiments are depicted in the figures, each experiment was repeated at least twice, and the results were highly reproducible. The concentration values are the means of two to four experiments, and the accuracy varied from ±2% in the case of extracellular products to ±10% in the case of intracellular metabolites with concentrations below 5 mm. The quantification of phosphorylated metabolites and the measurement of α-PGM activity were performed as described by Ramos et al. (31Ramos A. Boels I.C. de Vos W.M. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Carbon and phosphorus chemical shifts are referenced to external methanol or H3PO4 (85%) designated at 49.3 and 0.0 ppm, respectively. Chemicals—[1-13C]Glucose (99% enrichment) and [1-13C]galactose (99% enrichment) were obtained from Campro Scientific (Veenendaal, The Netherlands) and Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA), respectively. All other chemicals were reagent grade and obtained from Sigma. A BLASTp search of L. lactis MG1363 and IL1403 genomes using sequences of proteins in the α-d-phosphohexomutase superfamily identified femD as the best hit. FemD, annotated as a putative phosphoglucosamine mutase (14Bolotin A. Wincker P. Mauger S. Jaillon O. Malarme K. Weissenbach J. Ehrlich S.D. Sorokin A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 731-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), is a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 48 kDa. To ascertain whether femD encodes a protein with α-PGM activity, the gene (1356 bp) was cloned into pNZ8048 under the control of the nisininducible promoter and introduced into NZ9000. Extracts of nisin-induced NZ9000(pNZ8048-femD) cells contained a clearly overproduced protein with a size of 48 kDa (data not shown). Moreover, the activity of α-PGM in the induced strain was identical to that in control cells (0.15 units/mg of protein), indicating that femD does not encode an α-PGM. A PCR strategy to clone the lactococcal α-PGM gene using degenerate primers based on highly conserved regions of phosphohexomutases (16Shackelford G.S. Regni C.A. Beamer L.J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2130-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the complementation of an Escherichia coli pgm::tet mutant (35Lu M. Kleckner N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5847-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with a genomic library of L. lactis were also attempted without success. Consequently, purification of α-PGM activity was pursued to obtain protein sequence information and to identify the gene. α-PGM was partially purified (100-fold). Fractions from the last column contained several bands as visualized by SDS-PAGE, but only two proteins (28 and 37 kDa) co-eluted with the PGM activity in all purification steps. These two protein bands were excised, and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined to be MKKILSFD and MTVLVLG, respectively. The corresponding open reading frames in the L. lactis IL1403 genome sequence were yfgH (NP_266726, hypothetical protein) and galE (NP_268136, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase), respectively. The product of galE was shown to be UDP-glucose 4-epimerase by others (36Vaughan E.E. Pridmore R.D. Mollet B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4893-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Grossiord B.P. Luesink E.J. Vaughan E.E. Arnaud A. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and cloning and overexpression of galE in NZ9000 did not lead to enhancement of α-PGM activity (data not shown). The yfgH (herein renamed pgmH) gene contains 759 bp and codes for a protein with 252 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 28,276 kDa. The gene from MG1363 was cloned into pNZ8048 and expressed in strain NZ9000. Induction with nisin of an NZ9000(pgmH+) culture grown on Glc-containing M17 medium resulted in a 30-fold increase in α-PGM activity, thus proving that pgmH encodes L. lactis α-PGM. In the chromosome of L. lactis MG1363, pgmH is flanked by yfgL and yfgG (Fig. 1A), both of unknown function.4 All three genes are preceded by Shine-Dalgarno sequences (5′-AAATAGGAGA-3′ for pgmH). A putative promoter region containing an extended -10 sequence (5′-TGTTATAAT-3′) precedes the pgmH coding sequence. Inverted repeat sequences (5′-AAAAAGCAATCTATTTTGATTAGATTGTTTTT-3′ and 5′-AAAAAGTTGTCATTAATGACAGCTTTTT-3′) followed by AT-rich regions downstream of the yfgL and pgmH stop codons, respectively, could function as transcriptional terminators. Therefore, it is unlikely that the three genes are organized in an operon-like structure, and possibly, they have unrelated functions. A similar genomic organization has been observed for L. lactis ssp. lactis IL1403 (14Bolotin A. Wincker P. Mauger S. Jaillon O. Malarme K. Weissenbach J. Ehrlich S.D. Sorokin A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 731-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the product of pgmH (DQ778336) (Fig. 1B) has no sequence homology to proteins from the α-d-phosphohexomutase family. It shows ∼37% identity to hypothetical proteins from human colonizing Gram-positive bacteria (ZP_00121741, Bifidobacterium longum; and YP_056695, Propionibacterium acnes) and ∼25% identity to eukaryotic phosphomannomutases (PMMs) (Fig. 1B). These proteins have been classified as members of the HAD superfamily (PF03332; www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam). Despite the low overall identity, the α-PGM sequence contains the four conserved motifs that characterize the HAD superfamily: motif I (DXDX(T/V)), motif II ((S/T)XX), and motifs III and IV (KX18-30(G/S)(D/S)) (38Roberts A.

Using a proteomics approach, filamin-A was identified as a novel interacting protein that bound to GST-PTP-PEST. This interaction was confirmed in vitro and in cells by coimmunoprecipitation. The site of filamin interaction on PTP-PEST was mapped to the fourth proline-rich region (Pro4). PTP-PEST has previously been implicated in the regulation of cytokinesis. In further support of this finding, expression of PTP-PEST in HeLa cells resulted in the formation of multinucleated cells. A PTP-PEST mutant lacking Pro4 and unable to bind filamin-A failed to induce the multinucleated phenotype. Further, depletion of filamin-A in HeLa cells was found to reduce the PTP-PEST-dependent multinucleation phenotype. Hence, we conclude that the interaction of PTP-PEST with filamin-A may function in the control of cytokinesis in mammalian cells.

PTP-PEST is ubiquitously expressed, whereas PTP-HCSF/BDP1 and LYP/PEP are restricted in expression to hematopoetic tissue, although PTP-HCSF/BDP1 is also expressed in the brain (2Cheng J. Daimaru L.

PTP-PEST and related phosphatases have been implicated as negative regulators of B and T cell signaling, in part by controlling cytoskeletal changes required for lymphocyte function (6Badour K.

Interestingly, overexpression of PTP-PEST and ablation of PTP-PEST expression results in the same phenotype, impairment of cell migration (5Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D.

These findings suggest that perturbation of phosphotyrosine homeostasis with an excess or deficiency of PTP-PEST retards cell movement. PTP-PEST controls cell motility by regulating membrane protrusion via modulating the activity of Rac (9Sastry S.K. Lyons P.D. Schaller M.D. Burridge K. J.

One other interesting phenotype exhibited by PTP-PEST-null cells is an apparent defect in cytokinesis (5Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PTP-PEST might control cytokinesis is undefined, but is postulated to involve a PTP-PEST associated protein, PSTPIP, which localizes to the cleavage furrow (11Spencer S.

The PEST family of PTPs contains an N-terminal catalytic domain and a large C-terminal domain with numerous PEST and proline-rich sequences.

The primary function of these interactions is apparently to recruit tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates into complex with PTP-PEST to facilitate their dephosphorylation (14Garton A.J. Burnham M.R.

Given the role of the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of PTP-PEST in directing protein dephosphorylation by the direct and indirect recruitment of substrates into complex, we sought to further elucidate PTP-PEST function by identifying additional C-terminal domain binding partners. The actin-binding protein filamin-A was identified as a PTP-PEST associated protein using a proteomics approach. Filamin-A is a 280-kDa actin-binding protein (also known as ABP280) containing a pair of N-terminal calponin homology domains, which function to bind actin. Filamin-A cross-links filamentous actin into a branched orthogonal meshwork in vivo (23van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 24Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). C-terminal to the actin binding domains are 24 repeats of a 96 amino acid motif, which serve as docking sites for many other proteins, including a number of signaling molecules like Rho family proteins and MKK4 (25Marti A. Luo Z. Cunningham C. Ohta Y. Hartwig J. Stossel T.P. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2620-2628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Thus filamin-A is also envisioned to perform a signaling function by serving as a scaffold to tether signaling molecules (23van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 24Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). PTP-PEST is the first identified tyrosine phosphatase that associates with filamin-A. The fourth proline rich region of PTP-PEST was found to mediate filamin-A binding and was also required for the induction of a multinucleated phenotype upon exogenous expression of PTP-PEST in HeLa cells, suggesting that docking with filamin-A might facilitate one of the biological functions controlled by PTP-PEST. Cells—HEK 293 and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and HeLa cells in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method using 10 μg of DNA per 10-cm tissue culture plate (27Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected using TransIT-TKO according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Mirus, Madison, WI). Cells (7.5 × 105) were plated in a 6-cm tissue culture plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C prior to transfection. Routinely, 30 μl of TransIT-TKO were incubated with 7.5 μg of DNA in 750 μl of serum-free DMEM for 10 min prior to addition to the cells. Adenovirus constructs were generous gifts from Dr. Joan Taylor (UNC) and Dr. Mark Sussman (San Diego State University). The control and filamin (SMARTpool™) siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). For adenovirus infection, 2 × 106 cells were incubated with 30 PFU/cell at 37 °C for 24 h. Experiments were performed 72-h postinfection. For metabolic labeling, cells were grown to 80% confluence, washed with serum-free medium, then incubated overnight in methionine- and cysteine-free medium containing 10% conditioned media and 1.25 mCi 35S-Translabel (MP Biomedicals, Inc, Irvine CA). Cell cultures were viewed in phase contrast using a Nikon TMS inverted microscope and imaged using a Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera (×100 magnification). Fluorescence Microscopy and Flow Cytometry—For expression analysis of YFP fusion proteins, HeLa cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then incubated with PBS containing 100 ng/ml 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 3 min. The cells were washed once more in PBS, and mounted in a mixture of 10% Tris, pH 7.5, 90% glycerol, and 25 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo (2,2,2)octane (DABCO) (Sigma). Immunostaining with filamin-A (1:500-Chemicon International, Victoria BC), PTP-PEST (1:100-Exalpha Biologicals, Maynard, MA), and β-tubulin (1:100 Sigma) monoclonal antibodies was performed on ice-cold 100% methanol-fixed cells (5 min room temperature) followed by DAPI staining and mounting as described above. For analysis by flow cytometry, trypsinized HeLa cells were washed once in PBS, resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, and fixed by addition of 315 μl of 95% ice-cold ethanol. The cells were stored at –20 °C until analysis. One hour prior to flow cytometry, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed once in PBS, then resuspended in 500 μl of PBS containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide and 30 μg/ml RNaseA. The cells were vortexed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Flow cytometry was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan interfaced to a Cytomation, Inc. Cicero data acquisition system in the UNC Flow Cytometry Facility. Data were analyzed using Summit version 3.1 (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). Molecular Biology—GST fusion proteins containing fragments of PTP-PEST were engineered using PCR to amplify segments of the PTP-PEST open reading frame. Amplified product was inserted into pGEX2TK (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with the GST coding sequence. Two deletion mutants of PTP-PEST were created, ΔPro4, in which residues 674 through 682 were deleted, and ΔPro5, in which the C-terminal 20 amino acids were deleted. This latter mutation is similar to the ΔCTH mutant of PTP-HSCF/BDP, which deletes the C-terminal 24 amino acids and abolishes PSTPIP binding (11Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These were created by amplification of the entire plasmid, except for the sequences to be deleted, followed by blunt end ligation. Point mutations were engineered into PTP-PEST using the QuikChange strategy (Stratagene, La Jolla CA). Sequence analysis was performed on each mutant to verify the intended point mutations/deletions and that no unintended mutations were present. These analyses were performed in the UNC-CH Genome Analysis Facility on a model 3730 DNA Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the ABI PRISM™ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase, FS (PerkinElmer, Applied Biosystems Division). Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Expression of the fusion proteins in Escherichia coli was induced by incubation with 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4–5 h at room temperature. The bacteria were lysed by sonication, and the proteins purified by binding to glutathione-agarose beads. The fusion proteins were quantified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Protein Analysis—Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) or 0.1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris.HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and the protein concentration determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were performed using 1–2 mg of protein and 10 μl of polyclonal antiserum or 2 μl of purified antibody. Immune complexes were precipitated using protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose beads, washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with Tris-buffered saline and boiled in sample buffer. For GST pulldown experiments, 1–2 mg of lysate was precleared with 20 μg of GST bound to glutathione beads for 45 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was then incubated with 10–20 μg of fusion protein immobilized on glutathione beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice in lysis buffer, twice in Tris-buffered saline and boiled in sample buffer. Immune complexes and proteins bound to GST fusion proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using a variety of primary antibodies, secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence for detection (Amersham Biosciences). Commercially available antibodies against filamin (Chemicon International, Victoria BC) and β-tubulin (Sigma) were used for these analyses. The polyclonal PTP-PEST antiserum used in this study has been described (20Shen Y. Lyons P. Cooley M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1405-1413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Samples were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the bands visualized by silver staining. Protein identification by mass spectrometry was done in the Michael Hooker Proteomics Core Facility at UNC-CH. Briefly, the band of interest was excised and digested with trypsin at ∼1:50 enzyme/substrate ratio. Tryptic peptides were eluted from the gel, and MALDI analysis was performed on a Bruker Reflex III time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker). The mass spectrum was analyzed using the RADARS bioinformatics program (28Field H.I. Fenyo D. Beavis R.C. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Identification of a Novel PTP-PEST Binding Partner—The noncatalytic domains of PTPs serve as docking sites for other proteins including substrates (29Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Whereas a number of substrates and adaptor proteins are known to bind the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of PTP-PEST, it seems likely that additional binding partners remain to be identified. As a first step in the identification of novel binding partners, recombinant GST fusion proteins containing three different fragments of PTP-PEST, immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, were incubated with lysates of HEK 293 cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. After washing, bound proteins were segregated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. A number of proteins bound to all of the fusion proteins including the GST negative control. Each of the regions of PTP-PEST bound uniquely to several proteins. The catalytic domain of PTP-PEST (amino acids 1–305) specifically bound to four proteins with molecular masses of 300, 90, 68, and 55 kDa. The N-terminal region of the noncatalytic domain, containing amino acids 297–493, bound specifically to two proteins, a 305 and an 80 kDa proteins. The most striking associated protein was the 280-kDa protein that uniquely bound to the fusion protein containing the C-terminal region of the noncatalytic domain, containing amino acids 470–775 (Fig. 1). Two additional proteins of molecular mass 80 and 58 kDa were also associated with this fusion protein. A proteomics approach was chosen to pursue the identity of novel PTP-PEST binding partners. Twenty milligrams of HEK 293 cell lysate were incubated with 600 μg of GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathioneagarose beads. The beads were washed, bound proteins eluted with sample buffer and run on a preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by silver staining. The 280-kDa protein was again found to associate with the fusion protein containing amino acids 471–775 of PTP-PEST, but was not found in complex with other fusion proteins (data not shown). The protein band was excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. Peptides were eluted from the gel and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry at the Michael Hooker Proteomics Core Facility at UNC-CH. The spectrum of the 280-kDa PTP-PEST associated protein was analyzed using the RADARS bioinformatics software and identified as filamin-A (expectation value 4.3 × 10–5, 13% peptide coverage). Thus, based upon its mass fingerprint, PTP-PEST appeared to associate with filamin (also known as actin-binding protein (ABP-280). Validation That Filamin Binds PTP-PEST—To validate the finding that filamin binds PTP-PEST, GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Lysates of HEK 293 cells were incubated with GST alone or GST-PTP-PEST fusion proteins, which were immobilized on glutathione beads. The beads were washed and bound filamin was detected by Western blotting. Whereas filamin did not bind to GST alone, filamin was associated with the fragment of PTP-PEST extending from residue 470–775 (Fig. 2A). This result validated the identification of filamin as a binding partner of recombinant PTP-PEST. To further verify this interaction, endogenous PTP-PEST was immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 lysates using a polyclonal antiserum and the immune complex analyzed by Western blotting with a filamin antibody. Endogenous filamin was detected in the PTP-PEST immune complex, but was not detected in preimmune control immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2B). The reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using lysates of Hela cells infected with adenoviruses designed to express GFP or PTP-PEST (Fig. 2C). Filamin was immunoprecipitated and the immune complex blotted for associated PTP-PEST using the polyclonal antiserum (Fig. 2D). PTP-PEST was detected in the filamin immune complex from PTP-PEST-expressing cells, but was not found in the isotype control immune complex (Fig. 2D). A small amount of PTP-PEST could be detected in filamin immune complexes from GFP-expressing cells. This reflected interaction between endogenous PTP-PEST and filamin (Fig. 2D). These reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations suggest that filamin is a bona fide binding partner of PTP-PEST and that the two proteins are likely to associate in vivo. Identification of the Filamin Binding Site on PTP-PEST—To map the region of PTP-PEST required for filamin binding, GST fusion proteins containing different fragments of PTP-PEST were used. Lysates were incubated with fusion proteins immobilized to glutathione-agarose beads and bound filamin was detected by Western blotting. A recombinant protein containing amino acids 560–700 of PTP-PEST bound filamin, whereas fusion proteins containing PTP-PEST residues 471–560 or 700–775 did not (Fig. 3A). This experiment narrowed the filamin binding site to within residues 560–700 of PTP-PEST. Two additional fusion proteins encoding residues 560–650 and 600–700 were tested for filamin binding. The former failed to bind filamin, whereas the latter was able to bind filamin (Fig. 3B). This finding suggested that the filamin binding site on PTP-PEST was likely between residues 650 and 700, a region that contains the fourth proline-rich sequence of PTP-PEST, Pro4. As numerous proteins dock to PTP-PEST via proline-rich sequences in its C-terminal noncatalytic domain, Pro4 appeared as a good candidate binding site for filamin. To test this hypothesis, a 9-amino acid deletion removing Pro4 was engineered into full-length PTP-PEST (ΔPro4). For this experiment, PTP-PEST constructs were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion proteins to assess the ability of these mutants to co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous filamin. YFP-PTP-PEST, YFP-ΔPro4, and YFP-ΔPro5 (a mutation deleting the C-terminal 20 residues which contains Pro5) were expressed to similar levels, as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 3C). Filamin was immunoprecipitated from lysates and associated PTP-PEST detected by Western blotting using a PTP-PEST polyclonal antibody. Whereas YFP-PTP-PEST and YFP-ΔPro5 were co-immunoprecipitated with filamin, the YFP-ΔPro4 mutant was defective for filamin binding (Fig. 3D). This result supports the contention that this proline-rich region is the site of interaction between PTP-PEST and filamin. PTP-PEST Expression Induces a Multinucleated Phenotype—HeLa cell populations stably expressing PTP-PEST variants as YFP fusion proteins were established by drug selection and sorting by FACS. Examination of wild-type YFP-PTP-PEST-expressing HeLa cells revealed a high frequency of cells with a multinucleated phenotype (Fig. 4A). This phenotype is intriguing, given the reported role of PTP-PEST in controlling cytokinesis (5Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The wild-type YFP-PTP-PEST-expressing cells exhibited a severe cell proliferation defect that resulted in a rapid loss of protein expression (data not shown). The multinucleated phenotype was recapitulated using two different methods of transient expression; infection with adenoviral vectors and transient expression of YFP fusion proteins. HeLa cells were infected with an adenovirus designed to express GFP (Ad-GFP), which served as a negative control, or with the adenovirus-PTP-PEST (Ad-PTP-PEST). Seventy-two hours postinfection, nuclei were stained with DAPI, and the cells visualized by immunofluorescence using a PTP-PEST or a β-tubulin antibody, or by visualizing GFP fluorescence. Ad-GFP-infected cells were rarely observed to contain more than a single nucleus, whereas Ad-PTP-PEST infected cells were frequently observed to contain multiple nuclei (Fig. 4B). Multinucleated cells were scored in multiple experiments and expressed as percentage of cells containing multiple nuclei. Whereas a small percentage of control cell populations contained more than a single nucleus, ∼25% of the Ad-PTP-PEST-infected cells were multinucleated (Fig. 4C). This phenotype was further validated by examining the ploidy of Ad-GFP and Ad-PTP-PEST infected cells by flow cytometry. Asynchronously growing cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Control cells exhibited the typical profile of cycling cells with a peak of cells with 2N DNA content, a peak of cells with 4N DNA content and a population of cells with DNA content between 2N and 4N indicative of cells in S phase (Fig. 4D). Ad-PTP-PEST cells exhibited the same basic profile with two notable differences. First, the ratio of cells with 4N DNA content to cells with 2N DNA content was increased. Second, there was a population of cells with greater than 4N DNA content that was not present in the control cells. The flow cytometric analysis also supports the finding that PTP-PEST-expressing cells exhibit a higher frequency of multiple nuclei. The Pro4 Region Is Required to Induce the Multinucleated Phenotype—To begin to address the mechanism by which PTP-PEST generates a multinuclear phenotype, mutants of PTP-PEST were analyzed for their ability to induce this phenotype. YFP-PTP-PEST fusion proteins were transiently expressed in HeLa cells. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, cells were fixed, and stained with DAPI, and cells examined by fluorescent microscopy. Cells expressing exogenous protein were identified as YFP-positive cells and the number of nuclei per YFP-positive cell counted (Fig. 5A). Less than 5% of control cells, expressing the empty YFP vector, exhibited multiple nuclei. Approximately 17% of the YFP-PTP-PEST-expressing cells exhibited the multinucleated phenotype (Fig. 5B). Thus the results obtained using adenovirus to express exogenous PTP-PEST were recapitulated using transient transfection of YFP fusion proteins. To address the role of phosphatase activity in inducing the formation of multinucleated cells, a catalytically defective mutant was used. Two mutations were engineered into PTP-PEST, C231S, which removes the catalytic cysteine and abolishes activity, and R237D, which dramatically reduces the affinity of phosphatases for their substrates (30Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 31Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This latter mutation ensured that the mutant would not exhibit neomorphic effects because of substrate trapping in vivo. In contrast to YFP-PTP-PEST, YFP-RD/CS induced a multinucleated phenotype in ∼6% of cells, which was not statistically different from"
