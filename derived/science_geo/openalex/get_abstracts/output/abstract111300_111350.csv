https://openalex.org/W1521975179,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) has recently been shown to induce insulin resistance. We have examined the possible effect of TNF on the early events in insulin transmembrane signaling. Incubation of the insulin-sensitive rat hepatoma Fao cells with 5 nM TNF for 1 h led to a 65% decrease in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both the insulin receptor beta-subunit and IRS-1, its major cytosolic substrate. TNF-induced impairment of tyrosine phosphorylation was maximal at 0.5 nM and was not accompanied by any reduction in insulin binding. Sixteen hours of TNF incubation led to further impairment in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. Our findings suggest that TNF may exert its anti-insulin effect by interrupting the early insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation events, which are crucial to insulin transmembrane signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1591133722,"Synaptotagmin I is a Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding protein of synaptic vesicles with an essential function in neurotransmission. Ca2+/phospholipid binding by synaptotagmin I may be mediated by its C2 domains, sequence motifs that have been implicated in the Ca2+ regulation of a variety of proteins. However, it is currently unknown if C2 domains are sufficient for Ca2+/phospholipid binding or if they even directly participate in Ca2+/phospholipid binding. In order to address this question, we have studied the Ca2+/phospholipid-binding properties of the first C2 domain of synaptotagmin I. Our results show that this C2 domain by itself binds Ca2+ and phospholipids with high affinity (half-maximal binding at 4-6 microM free Ca2+) and exhibits strong positive cooperativity. The C2 domain is specific for negatively charged phospholipids and for those divalent cations that are known to stimulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Ca2+ > Sr2+, Ba2+ > Mg2+). These studies establish that C2 domains can serve as independently folding Ca2+/phospholipid-binding domains. Furthermore, the cation specificity and the cooperativity of Ca2+ binding by the C2 domain from synaptotagmin I support a role for this protein in mediating the Ca2+ signal in neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W1536767595,"Ceramide is emerging as a putative second messenger mediating effects of extracellular agents on cell growth and differentiation (Okazaki, T., Bielawska, A., Bell, R. M., and Hannun, Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15822-15831) and programed cell death (Obeid, L. M., Linardic, C. M., Karolak, L. A., and Hannun, Y. A. (1993) Science 259, 1769-1771). In this study, the eight stereoisomers of C2-ceramide and dihydroceramide were synthesized, and their cellular activity was investigated. The four stereoisomers of C2-ceramide were active in inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis with modest differences in potency. On the other hand, with C2-dihydroceramide only the threo compounds were active in these assays whereas the erythro compounds were totally inactive. Thus, of the two naturally occurring molecules, the analog of D-erythro-ceramide (with the 4-5 trans double bond) was active, whereas the analog of D-erythro-dihydroceramide was inactive. These results demonstrate the specificity of ceramide action and suggest that the introduction of the double bond is critical for imparting the biochemical and biological activity of ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1548497076,"Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) has been recently shown to be generated in pancreatic beta-cells by glucose stimulation, serving as a second messenger for Ca2+ mobilization in the endoplasmic reticulum in the process of insulin secretion (Takasawa, S., Nata, K., Yonekura, H., and Okamoto, H. (1993) Science 259, 370-373). In the present study, we isolated a cDNA for CD38, which has been reported to be a human leukocyte antigen, from a human insulinoma and expressed the cDNA in COS-7 cells. CD38 expression was observed in the plasma membrane and the microsome fractions of the COS-7 cells. When we incubated the plasma membrane fraction with NAD+ and analyzed the reaction products by high pressure liquid chromatography, the formation of cADPR was observed in addition to the ADP-ribose (ADPR) formation. When the plasma membrane fraction was incubated with cADPR, cADPR was converted to ADPR stoichiometrically. These results suggest that CD38 has both cADPR-forming and -hydrolyzing activities. Moreover, we found that ATP (2-10 mM), generated in the glucose metabolism in beta-cells, inhibited the cADPR-hydrolyzing activity, resulting in the increased formation of cADPR. These findings indicate a role for CD38 in the synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR in the process of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1481859923,"To probe the ligand receptor interface, a number of point mutations were introduced in selected regions of human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and analyzed for selective binding to recombinant 55- and 75-kDa TNF receptors in competition with radiolabeled wild-type TNF alpha. Generally, mutations in the loop from position 29 to 34 and at positions 86 and 146 preferentially impaired binding to the 75-kDa TNF receptor, whereas mutations in the region from 143 to 145 mainly affected binding to the 55-kDa TNF receptor. Mutation of the conserved Tyr87 resulted in a dramatic loss of binding activity to both receptors. The selectivity for one or the other receptor type was found to be enhanced by combining two or three point mutations, the effects of the single mutations with respect to receptor selectivity being at least additive. A combination of the mutations Arg32-->Trp and Ser86-->Thr yielded a double mutant (R32W-S86T) with wild-type binding to the 55 kDa, but no measurable binding to the 75-kDa TNF receptor. In contrast, combining the Asp143-->Asn and Ala145-->Arg mutations (D143N-A145R) resulted in a complete loss of binding to the 55-kDa TNF receptor, whereas binding to the 75-kDa TNF receptor was impaired by only 5-10-fold. In functional assays, selective activation of the 55-kDa TNF receptor by the R32W-S86T mutant elicited a full cytotoxic response in human KYM-1 cells and secretion of interleukin 6 and granulocyte-macrophate colony-stimulating factor in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In contrast, stimulation of the 75-kDa TNF receptor with the D143N-A145R mutant as well as with agonistic antibodies failed to induce these responses."
https://openalex.org/W1525274814,"Members of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins are localized in the cytosol of cells by complexation with a protein known as (Rho)GDI. We show by sucrose gradient equilibrium sedimentation analysis that all of the Rac protein present in human neutrophil cytosol exists as a complex with (Rho)GDI under non-activating conditions. This interaction can be disrupted in the presence of various lipids which have been shown to have biological activity in a variety of systems, including NADPH oxidase activation. Particularly effective were arachidonic acid, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylinositols. These lipids were active at concentrations from 0.5-50 microM and were capable of disrupting complexation of (Rho)GDI with both GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Rac, although the latter were more sensitive to lipid. These data suggest that certain lipids generated in chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils may play a role in modulating the activity of Rac and thus NADPH oxidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1510505825,"Ribonucleotide reductase consists of two nonidentical subunits, proteins R1 and R2, the latter of which contains an iron-tyrosyl free radical center essential for activity. We have studied the in vivo effects on the R2 protein of the potent iron chelators parabactin and desferrioxamine using R2-overproducing mouse cells with a tyrosyl free radical signal easily quantifiable by EPR spectroscopy. Both chelators inhibited cell growth, and the inhibition was reversible by iron. Furthermore, both chelators, which penetrate cells and chelate the intracellular iron pool, caused a disappearance of the R2 tyrosyl free radical. In parallel, there was an accumulation of apo-R2 protein in the inhibited cells. In vitro studies using pure, 59Fe-labeled recombinant mouse R2 protein unexpectedly showed that its iron center is labile at physiological temperatures and that iron is spontaneously lost from the protein even in the absence of chelators in a temperature-dependent process. Our conclusion is that parabactin or desferrioxamine inhibits ribonucleotide reduction and cell growth not by directly attacking the iron-radical center of the R2 protein, but instead by chelating the intracellular iron pool. This prevents the regeneration of the iron-radical center both in newly synthesized apo-R2 protein and in apo-R2 protein continuously formed from active R2 protein by the loss of iron."
https://openalex.org/W2100285359,"Metabolic labeling studies suggest that Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains many glycoproteins that are anchored in the lipid bilayer by glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors. Membrane anchors were purified from a crude yeast membrane protein fraction and analyzed by two-dimensional 1H-1H NMR, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, compositional and methylation linkage analyses, as well as chemical and enzymatic modifications. The yeast glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors consist of the following structures: ethanolamine-PO4-6(R-2)Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4Glc-NH2 alpha 1-6myo-inositol-1-PO4-lipid, where R is mainly Man alpha 1- (80%) with some Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1- (15%) and Man alpha 1-3Man alpha 1- (5%). The core region of the yeast anchors (ethanolamine-PO4-6Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4GlcNH2 alpha 1-6myo-inositol-1-PO4) is identical to the conserved core region found in glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors from protozoa and mammals. The lipid moieties of the total yeast glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors are mainly ceramides, consisting mostly of C18:0 phytosphingosine and C26:0 fatty acid. However, the lipid moiety of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor of the purified ggp125 protein is a lyso- or diacylglycerol, containing C26:0 fatty acids. This suggests that yeast adds different lipid components to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors of different proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1489955133,"Autophagic sequestration of endogenous lactate dehydrogenase or electroinjected [3H]raffinose in isolated rat hepatocytes was strongly suppressed by the Ca2+ chelator EGTA, unless the cells had previously been electroloaded in the presence of high concentrations of Ca2+ (1.2 mM). The extracellular Ca2+ chelator bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) and the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA/tetra(acetoxymethyl)-ester (BAPTA/AM) both inhibited autophagy to the same extent as did EGTA. Inhibitors of Ca(2+)-activated protein kinases (KN-62, H-7, W-7) had little or no effect on autophagy, indicating that the Ca2+ requirement of autophagy was not mediated by such kinases. Agents that elevate cytosolic Ca2+ by releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores, like thapsigargin, 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (tBuBHQ) and the ionophores A23187 and ionomycin, inhibited autophagy strongly, implicating depletion of sequestered rather than of cytosolic intracellular Ca2+ as a common mechanism of inhibition. Lysosomal (propylamine-sensitive) protein degradation, known to be largely autophagy-dependent, was inhibited by thapsigargin and tBuBHQ. Thapsigargin had no effect on cellular ATP levels, but all agents tested (thapsigargin, tBuBHQ, ionophores) inhibited protein synthesis. Our results suggest that autophagy, like protein synthesis, is dependent on the presence of Ca2+ in some intracellular storage compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1597850573,"Recombinant hsc70, a purified glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the C-terminal domain of hsc70 (GST-Ct), and an internal 18-kDa polypeptide located immediately after the 44-kDa ATPase domain of hsc70 were investigated for their peptide binding properties. The dissociation constants of the S-peptide for native hsc70 (Kd = 5-8 microM), GST-Ct (Kd = 6.5 microM), and the 18-kDa fragment (Kd = 8.1 microM) are virtually identical. In addition, polylysine and (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 do not show high affinity toward hsc70, GST-Ct, and the 18-kDa fragment, whereas peptide GT4 and P3a show comparably high affinity toward these polypeptides. These observations indicate that the peptide binding domain of hsc70 is confined in the internal 18-kDa fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1924274239,"Murine keratinocytes expressing an oncogenic rasHa gene produce benign tumors in vivo and demonstrate altered responses to phorbol esters in vitro. Cultured keratinocytes transduced with the v-rasHa gene (v-rasHa keratinocytes) are resistant to Ca(2+)-induced terminal differentiation, a process that is dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) activation in normal keratinocytes. Five PKC isoforms expressed in keratinocytes (alpha, delta, epsilon, zeta, and eta) were examined for quantitative or qualitative changes in v-rasHa-transformed cells. No quantitative changes were detected, but PKC delta was tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-rasHa keratinocytes and in benign neoplastic keratinocyte cell lines expressing an activated allele of the c-rasHa gene. Analysis of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of PKC delta from keratinocytes indicated that phosphorylated PKC delta was not stimulated by phorbol ester treatment. The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine was able to induce differentiation in v-rasHa keratinocytes and benign tumor cell lines, and concomitantly tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC delta decreased. This interaction between tyrosine kinases and PKC delta in cells expressing an oncogenic rasHa gene may represent a molecular block to differentiation in neoplastic keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1574928346,"The periplasmic invertase was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae och1::LEU2 disruptant cells (delta och1), which have a defect in elongation of the outer chain attached to the N-linked core oligosaccharides (Nakayama, K., Nagasu, T., Shimma, Y., Kuromatsu, J., and Jigami, Y. (1992) EMBO J. 11, 2511-2519). Structural analysis of the pyridylaminated (PA) neutral oligosaccharides released by hydrazinolysis and N-acetylation confirmed that the och1 mutation causes a complete loss of the alpha-1,6-polymannose outer chain, although the PA oligosaccharides (Man9GlcNAc2-PA and Man10GlcNAc2-PA), in which one or two alpha-1,3-linked mannose(s) attached to the endoplasmic reticulumn (ER)-form core oligosaccharide (Man8GlcNAc2) were also detected. Analysis of the delta och1 mnn1 strain oligosaccharides released from total cell mannoprotein revealed that the delta och1 mnn1 mutant eliminates the alpha-1,3-mannose attached to the core and accumulates predominantly a single ER-form oligosaccharide species (Man8GlcNAc2), suggesting a potential use of this strain as a host cell to produce glycoproteins containing mammalian high mannose type oligosaccharides. The delta och1 mnn1 alg3 mutants accumulated Man5GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 in total cell mannoprotein, confirming the lack of outer chain addition to the incomplete corelike oligosaccharide and the leaky phenotype of the alg3 mutation. All the results suggest that the OCH1 gene encodes an alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase that is functional in the initiation of alpha-1,6-polymannose outer chain addition to the N-linked core oligosaccharide (Man5GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2) in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1603731520,"We have expressed the rat brain Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase type IV in insect cells. The recombinant enzyme is produced as a single polypeptide that migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 61 kDa. Recombinant CaM kinase IV undergoes slow CaM-dependent autophosphorylation. The autophosphorylation of CaM kinase IV occurs on serine residues but is not accompanied by the generation of a CaM-independent activity, as previously reported for the cerebellar enzyme. Comparison of peptide and protein phosphorylation by the recombinant CaM kinase IV and the cerebellar enzyme showed differences in their catalytic activities. The deduced primary sequence of CaM kinase IV contained a domain, 315Phe-Asn-Ala-Arg-Arg-Lys-Leu-Lys323, also found in the regulatory domain of CaM kinase II alpha (residues 293-300). Truncation of CaM kinase IV at Leu313 (at a position analogous to Leu290 in CaM kinase II alpha) generated a fully active, CaM-independent enzyme. This truncated enzyme no longer bound CaM. These data confirm that CaM kinase IV demonstrates intrasteric regulation by an autoinhibitory domain and provides insight into a potentially common mechanism for the regulation of the CaM-dependent multifunctional protein kinases. A number of synthetic peptides were examined for their phosphorylation by both CaM kinase II and IV. These studies showed that several peptides derived from phospholamban were preferential substrates for CaM kinase II whereas a peptide derived from S6 ribosomal protein was selectively phosphorylated by CaM kinase IV. Kinetic analysis of several peptide substrates suggests that while both CaM kinase II and IV recognize the sequence motif represented by R-X-X-T/S, other structural features are also involved in defining the unique substrate specificity of CaM kinase IV."
https://openalex.org/W2164801656,"CDC42, a member of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, regulates cytoskeletal rearrangements required for cell division. Activating mutations in CDC42 that are refractory to GTPase activation confer a phenotype of large, multinucleated cells. Like other small GTP-binding proteins, CDC42 is activated by a guanosine exchange factor and inactivated by a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). An unidentified 25-kDa platelet protein has been shown to function as a specific CDC42GAP. Here we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding this GAP from a human platelet-precursor cell line. Sequence analysis reveals the presence of three consensus box regions characteristic of rhoGAPs. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the three boxes derived from the new clone strongly stimulated the GTPase activity of CDC42 but was much less effective on other Rho proteins. This indicates that the cDNA clone encodes a specific GAP for CDC42. Sequence analysis also reveals a potential proline-rich Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding domain preceding the first consensus box. Binding experiments show that this motif can interact with the SH3 domains of p85 alpha and of c-Src. Thus, CDC42GAP may function as a link between CDC42 and other signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1553174726,"The phytochrome chromophore precursor, 3E-phytochromobilin, and the phycobiliprotein chromophore precursors, 3E-phycocyanobilin and 3E-phycoerythrobilin, are enzymatically converted to novel rubinoid products by purified rat liver biliverdin reductase. Phytochromobilin and phycocyanobilin are particularly good substrates for biliverdin reductase with Km and Vmax values very similar to those of the natural substrate, biliverdin IX alpha. Phycoerythrobilin is the least preferred of the three bilin substrates. 1H NMR spectroscopy of phycocyanorubin, the product of phycocyanobilin catalysis by biliverdin reductase, and comparison of absorption spectra of all three rubinoid products reveal that the C10 methine bridge is selectively reduced by biliverdin reductase without altering the A-ring ethylidene substituent. In vitro phytochrome assembly experiments demonstrate that the phytorubin products do not form photoactive adducts with recombinant apophytochrome. These results suggest that ectopic expression of biliverdin reductase in plants will prevent assembly of the functional photoreceptor and thus will potentially alter light-mediated plant growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W1936694663,"The enzymatic mechanism of primase was investigated using Escherichia coli and baculoviral overexpressed mouse primase subunits, p49 and p58. Neither of the singly purified primase subunits displayed primase activity alone, but the p49 subunit was able to extend a riboprimer, indicating that this subunit contains an RNA polymerase activity. The p58 subunit cooperated with the p49 subunit in binding the initiating purine to form the initial dinucleotide. After initiation, the p49 subunit alone was sufficient to extend the growing primer, but both the rate of p49 primer extension and its stability were influenced by the p58 subunit. The Km(ATP) in primer synthesis on poly(dT) of the p49-p58 heterodimeric primase complex was 10-fold higher than the Km(ATP) of the single p49 subunit in a ribo(A) primer extension assay. In addition, labeled ATP cross-linked to both of the individually purified subunits but with a striking difference in affinities; cross-linking was 11-fold more efficient to the p49 subunit. The interaction of the two primase subunits with polymerase alpha was also investigated. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that only the p58 subunit directly contacts the p180 subunit of DNA polymerase alpha. Competition experiments in the coupled primase-polymerase assay with a catalytically inactive mutant of DNA polymerase alpha and the Klenow fragment suggest that the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex does not dissociate from the primer during the transition from RNA to DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1537981848,"Abstract The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD1 and RAD10 genes are required for the incision step of excision repair, and in addition, they function in mitotic recombination. The RAD1 and RAD10 proteins are associated in a tight complex, and genetic studies have indicated that complex formation is essential for the RAD1/RAD10 controlled biological activities. We had previously purified the RAD10 protein to near homogeneity from yeast and shown that it is a DNA-binding protein with a strong preference for single-stranded DNA. In this study, we purify the RAD1 protein to near homogeneity from yeast and show that it also binds single-stranded DNA preferentially and that the RAD1/RAD10 complex possesses an endonuclease activity. We characterize the RAD1/RAD10 endonuclease activity on both single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs, using agarose gel electrophoresis and trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The RAD1/RAD10 nuclease exhibits a much higher level of activity on single-stranded DNA than double-stranded DNA. The susceptibility of double-stranded DNA to nicking by the RAD1/RAD10 enzyme is markedly dependent on the degree of negative superhelicity, such that a 15-fold increase in nicking rate is observed from superhelical state sigma = zero to sigma = -0.08. The enzyme produces 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate termini on both single- and double-stranded DNAs. We discuss the role of RAD1/RAD10 endonuclease in nucleotide excision repair and in mitotic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1580579463,"Aliphatic sulfonamides, as CH3SO2NH2, are very weak inhibitors of the carbonic anhydrases (KI congruent to 10(-4) M) and are extremely weak acids (Ka congruent to 10(-10.5) M). We now find CF3SO2NH2 a very potent inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase II (KI = 2 x 10(-9) M) and a much stronger acid (Ka = 10(-5.8) M). It freely dissolves in water, a 2% solution yielding pH 3.7, the strongest known sulfonamide acid. CHCl3/aqueous partition with this solution is very low, 0.006. The plot of CH3SO2NH2 and eight hydrophilic halo-alkyl congeners gives a linear relation over 5 orders of magnitude, pKI increasing as pKa declines. Transcorneal permeability of CF3SO2NH2 in rabbits is very high; from one drop on the cornea it rapidly gains access to the ciliary process, where it fully inhibits carbonic anhydrase and gives the maximum pressure drop (for any drug) of 6 mm Hg at 30-60 min. Action is short due to rapid disappearance of free drug from the eye at the rate of aqueous humor flow. Analyses are made of binding of CF3SO2NH2 to carbonic anhydrase and melanin in ciliary process. CF3SO2NH2 is not attacked by glutathione, is 75% bound to plasma protein, and is not taken into the renal secretory system. Excretion rate follows from glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. Intravenous injection thus leads to prolonged plasma levels (half-life, 24 h), a general diffusion into tissues and alkalinization of the urine, as with classic inhibitors. Drug is bound to carbonic anhydrase in red cells and decays with half-life of 4 days. The rapid and effective binding to carbonic anhydrase of this small hydrophilic molecule shows that complex lipophilic structures are not necessary for powerful inhibition of the enzyme. It does not appear essential for a sulfonamide to occupy a hydrophobic pocket in the active site cavity to react effectively at the zinc center."
https://openalex.org/W1575848918,"Small angle x-ray scattering and viscometric analyses of the alpha-zeins of maize in solution indicated that the molecules were asymmetric. Structure predictions of consensus sequences for the two classes of alpha-zeins, Z19 and Z22, were in good agreement with the alpha-helical contents determined by circular dichroism. Dimensions determined by small angle x-ray scattering and viscometry indicated a predominantly alpha-helical conformation. The data are discussed in relation to models for the solution conformation and to earlier models for alpha-zeins structure."
https://openalex.org/W1642366110,"Overexpressed PIF1 DNA helicase was purified from mitochondria to near homogeneity. Its ATPase and unwinding properties were characterized. The enzyme specifically utilizes ATP (or dATP) and MgCl2 (and to a lesser extent MnCl2). ATPase activity requires single-stranded DNA as an effector, duplex DNA being 100-fold less effective. The Keff, defined as the concentration of DNA required to achieve half-maximal ATPase activity, does not depend on single-stranded DNA length. Long duplex DNAs are poorly unwound and, moreover, dilution of the enzyme and its DNA substrate in the assay decreases DNA helicase activity. These data indicate that PIF1 helicase is a distributive enzyme, frequently turning from one DNA molecule to another. When forked substrates are used, unwinding by PIF1 is markedly stimulated. The enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 6.5 S, suggesting that it exists as a monomer in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1595220827,"The effect of introducing D-amino acid residues in an hexapeptide was examined both at the antigenic and immunogenic levels. A series of D-analogues of the model peptide of sequence IRGERA corresponding to the COOH-terminal residues 130-135 of histone H3 were produced. Four analogues contained a single change of an L-residue by the corresponding enantiomer, one peptide contained two D-residues and another one contained only D-residues (D-enantiomer). A peptide analogue was also synthesized in which the 2 Arg residues were replaced by Lys residues. The parent peptide and peptide analogues were injected into mice after covalent coupling to small unilamellar liposomes containing monophosphoryl lipid A as adjuvant. The substitution of L-Arg131 to Lys or D-Arg was found to change neither the antigenic nor immunogenic properties of the resulting peptides. In contrast, the substitution of Glu133, Arg134, and Ala135 by the respective enantiomers drastically altered the antigenicity of the modified peptides. Each of the six D-analogues induced an immune response with an unusually high level of IgG3 antibodies. The D-enantiomer produced IgG3 antibodies which reacted with the homologous peptide as well as with the all L-peptide and the parent protein H3 in solution but not with analogues containing one or two D-residues only. IgG3 antibodies produced against the all L-peptide reacted with the free all D-peptide but not with the other analogues containing D-residues in position 133, 134, and 135."
https://openalex.org/W1599859734,"Small cell lung carcinoma is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor that secretes several hormones, some of which act as autocrine growth factors. In order to obtain more information on the process of hormone secretion from this tumor, we have studied the role of intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations and voltage-operated calcium channels in the control of [3H]serotonin release from in vitro growing cell lines. We found that the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin and the Ca(2+)-ATPase antagonist thapsigargin induced a dose-dependent increase of intracellular Ca2+ and a parallel enhancement of [3H]serotonin release. KCl-induced depolarization also stimulated a dose- and Ca(2+)-dependent [3H]serotonin release that in the GLC8 cell line was effectively inhibited by Ca2+ channel antagonists (Cd2+, nitrendipine, verapamil, omega-conotoxin GVIA, and omega-agatoxin IVA) and potentiated by the Ca2+ channel agonist BayK8644. Autoantibodies against Ca2+ channels present in the sera of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic patients antagonized KCl- but not ionomycin-induced [3H]serotonin release. Polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that GLC8 cells express L-, N-, and P-type neuronal Ca2+ channel alpha 1 subunits, together with two types of Ca2+ channel beta subunits. The presence of three functionally distinct high threshold Ca2+ channels was also revealed by patch clamp experiments; high threshold Ca2+ channels were identified as dihydropyridine-sensitive (L-type), omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive (N-type), and omega-agatoxin IVA-sensitive (P-type). Our data demonstrate that [3H]serotonin is released by small cell lung carcinoma cells in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and that depolarization-induced [3H]serotonin release is mediated by Ca2+ influx through distinct, neuron-like, Ca2+ channel subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W1637925779,"A large body of evidence indicates that the genetic program of aging has co-evolved with the sexual mode of reproduction (Partridge, L., and Barton, N. H. (1993) Nature 362, 305-311). Age-dependent changes in target cell sensitivity to reproductive hormones can be considered part of this evolutionary linkage. Here we describe a novel regulatory element in the rat androgen receptor (AR) gene promoter associated with its age-dependent expression in the liver. This element consists of two (19 and 25 base pairs) contiguous sites, one specifically binding an Age-dependent Factor (ADF) and the other an Associated Factor (AF). Both deletion and point mutations of the ADF site result in about a 5-fold decline in the AR promoter function. Unlike AF, which is relatively tissue specific, ADF appears to be ubiquitous. The ubiquitous and evolutionarily conserved nature of ADF suggests a fundamental role of this novel transcription factor in programmed gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1571383380,"Kaliotoxin (KTX), a scorpion toxin characterized as a 37-residue inhibitor of the neuronal high conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels (KCa channels), has been chemically synthetized. Differences were observed between natural toxin and the two peptides, KTX(1-37) and KTX(1-37)-amide. Re-examination of the KTX sequence showed that an extra lysine residue was present at the C-terminal end. The 38-residue synthetic peptide was found identical with natural toxin. All three peptides had comparable activities, with LD50 values of 6-9 pmol/mouse after intracerebroventricular injection, and Kd = 2-8 nM for blockage of the whole cell and unitary molluscan KCa currents. Pairing of the disulfide bonds in synthetic KTX corresponded to that in charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin. A competition assay between 125I-KTX(1-37) and different toxins (KTX, dendrotoxin, charybdotoxin, MCD peptide, and iberiotoxin) for binding to rat brain synaptosomal membranes suggested that KTX interacts also with voltage-gated K+ channels. Shorter peptides, KTX(25-35)-amide and KTX(26-32)-amide, expressed no KTX activity, but were able to compete in binding. They were further shown to antagonize KTX in both its toxicity and blocking activity. The (26-32) sequence of KTX, which is a highly conserved region, may contain a low affinity binding subsite essential for potassium channel recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1605089838,"The Glut4 glucose transporter is poorly functional compared with other glucose transporter isoforms when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. To investigate the molecular basis for this poor functionality, we compared the biosynthesis and targeting of Glut1 and Glut4 in oocytes after microinjection of the corresponding mRNAs. Both Glut1 and Glut4 were present as lower molecular weight endoglycosidase H-sensitive and higher molecular weight endoglycosidase H-resistant. Subcellular fractionation indicated that Glut1 was targeted to the plasma membrane with a 6.6-fold greater efficiency than was Glut4. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the relative enrichment of Glut1 in the plasma membrane and the efficient intracellular sequestration of Glut4. As in mammalian cells, the endoglycosidase H-resistant form of Glut4 was concentrated in low-density intracellular vesicles, whereas Glut1 was distributed in intracellular vesicles of higher average density. The structural basis for the differential localization of Glut1 and Glut4 was investigated by determining the plasma membrane content of a series of chimeric Glut1/Glut4 molecules. These data indicated that two distinct regions of Glut4, encompassing residues 24-132 and the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail, confer intracellular sequestration on the chimeric transporter molecules. At least part of the sequestration effect of the more N-terminal domain was due to the incomplete maturation of chimeras containing this region, resulting in the accumulation of lower molecular weight endoglycosidase H-sensitive and endoglycosidase H-resistant forms, whereas the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail conferred sequestration of fully glycosylated chimeras in a low-density intracellular membrane compartment."

To study the putative role of GTP-binding proteins in this process, we have introduced non-hydrolyzable guanosine phosphate analogues into the cytosol of non-permeabilized HL-60 granulocytes using an endocytosis-hypoosmotic shock procedure. At the cytosolic concentrations obtained (100-500 microM), neither guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) nor guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)diphosphate (GDP beta S) affected basal [Ca2+]i. Ca2+ release in response to the receptor agonist fMet-Leu-Phe, the Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, or the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin was also unaffected by GTP gamma S or GDP beta S. In contrast, the activation of the Ca2+ influx pathway by fMet-Leu-Phe or by thapsigargin was blocked by GTP gamma S but not by GDP beta S. The GTP gamma S effect was mimicked by NaF. The GTP gamma S and NaF effects were independent of protein kinase C activation and actin polymerization. Our results demonstrate that a GTP-sensitive element is involved in the signaling between intracellular Ca2+ stores and plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. The identical effects of GTP gamma S and NaF suggest that the GTP-sensitive element is a heterotrimeric G-protein."
https://openalex.org/W1592468291,"Rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) is a 131-residue protein composed of two short alpha-helices (alpha I and alpha II) and 10 anti-parallel beta-strands organized into two nearly orthogonal beta-sheets. The structure of crystalline I-FABP with bound tetradecanoate (myristate) has been refined to a resolution of 1.5 A and compared to the 1.2 A structure of apo-I-FABP, the 1.9 A structure of I-FABP:hexadecanoate (palmitate) and the 1.75 A structure of I-FABP:9Z-octadecanoate (oleate) to determine how this model fatty acid receptor accommodates changes in the length of its fatty acid ligand. Myristate is located in the interior of the protein. A highly ordered, electrostatic network containing 7 hydrogen (H)-bonds links the OE1 and OE2 atoms of myristate's carboxylate group, the indole nitrogen of Trp82, NH1, and NH2 of Arg106, NE2, and OE1 of Gln115, and 2 interior ordered waters. The hydrocarbon chain of the bound fatty acid is slightly bent. Its convex face lies in a crevice, forming van der Waals contacts with the side chains of several hydrophobic and aromatic residues. Its concave face is exposed to an array of 8 interior ordered waters whose positions are stabilized by H-bond interactions with other waters, H-bond interactions with the side chains of polar/ionizable residues, and van der Waals contacts with the surface of the fatty acid. Addition of 2 or 4 methylenes to myristate produces remarkably little change in the positions of I-FABP's main chain and side chain atoms and interior ordered waters. The principal alterations are in the conformation of a surface opening (portal) connecting external and internal solvent and in the position of the benzene side chain of Phe55. Changes in the conformation of the portal reflect movement of two of its components: the backbone of alpha II and a type I turn (Ala73, Asp74) connecting two beta-strands. The positions of the main chain atoms of Ala73 and Asp74 appear to be determined by their ability to form van der Waals contacts with the omega-terminus of the fatty acid. The side chain of Phe55 appears to function as an adjustable aromatic lid, located over the portal, whose position is dependent on an ability to form van der Waals contacts with a fatty acid's omega-terminus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1627390038,"Phosphodiesterase (PDE) in bovine retinal rod outer segments is activated when it forms a membrane-bound complex with the alpha-subunit of transducin loaded with GTP (T alpha*). At maximal activation, this complex contains two T alpha* and all the subunits of native PDE (PDE alpha, PDE beta, and two inhibitory PDE gamma). We observed previously (Pages, F., Deterre, P., and Pfister, C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22018-22021) that the rate of GTP hydrolysis by transducin in a rod outer segment suspension is enhanced when T alpha* is bound to native PDE (PDE alpha beta gamma 2). In this article, we compare the effects of PDE species with different PDE gamma contents. We show that T alpha* hydrolyzes its GTP faster not only when bound to PDE alpha beta gamma 2, but also when bound to PDE alpha beta gamma or PDE alpha beta. Moreover, trypsin-treated PDE (PDE gamma-deprived soluble PDE) also induces an acceleration of GTP hydrolysis. On the contrary, addition of isolated PDE gamma alone does not accelerate GTP hydrolysis. The interaction between T alpha* and PDE gamma, which is essential for the activation of PDE by T alpha*, is apparently not responsible of the feedback of PDE on T alpha*. The interaction of primary importance for the acceleration of GTP hydrolysis would be that existing between T alpha* and PDE alpha beta."
https://openalex.org/W1521541569,"The transport of sphingomyelin from its site of synthesis, in the cis/medial-Golgi, to the plasma membrane has been investigated in monolayer cultures of rat hepatocytes. Sphingomyelin was synthesized intracellularly from [methyl-3H]choline, and the arrival of sphingomyelin at the plasma membrane was monitored by treatment of the cells with sphingomyelinase, which hydrolyzed only sphingomyelin at the cell surface. When hepatocytes were maintained at temperatures from 5 to 37 degrees C, both protein secretion and sphingomyelin trafficking to the cell surface were inhibited at low temperatures, especially at temperatures below 25 degrees C. Treatment of cells with the energy poison potassium cyanide prevented protein secretion and reduced the incorporation of [3H]choline into sphingomyelin, but did not affect the percentage of newly synthesized sphingomyelin that was transported to the cell surface. Brefeldin A and monensin, both of which disrupt protein movement through the Golgi apparatus, were used to evaluate the mechanism of transport of sphingomyelin to the plasma membrane. Although brefeldin A and monensin each effectively blocked protein secretion, sphingomyelin movement to the cell surface was not inhibited, even though sphingomyelin synthesis normally occurs in the Golgi. We conclude that the most likely mechanism of sphingomyelin transport to the cell surface is a vesicle-mediated process (because of the known topology of sphingomyelin synthesis and distribution). However, the putative vesicles that are involved in the movement of sphingomyelin to the plasma membrane are distinct from those that transport proteins for secretion. In addition, the route of trafficking of sphingomyelin to the plasma membrane is not one that requires an obligatory passage through the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1544836681,"An in vitro RNA bandshift assay has been developed to demonstrate the binding of purified recombinant encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3Dpol) to the 3'-noncoding region (NCR) and 30 nucleotides of the adjacent 3'-terminal poly(A) tail (3'-NCR(A)) of EMC virus RNA. The binding of 3Dpol to the 3'-NCR(A) fragment was specific since four other unrelated proteins including an RNA polymerase did not bind, and unlabeled 3'-NCR(A), but not alpha-globin mRNA, tRNA, or pure poly(A), competed with radiolabeled 3'-NCR(A) for binding. Surprisingly, 3Dpol failed to bind to the 3'-NCR of EMC virus RNA lacking the poly(A) tail. The results together show that EMC virus RNA template specificity depends only on 3Dpol, the 3'-NCR, and the poly(A) tail. This suggests that 3'-poly(A) is essential for viral RNA template selection by the EMC virus RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1558564424,"We recently identified four isoforms of bovine prostaglandin E receptor EP3 subtype, which are coupled to different signaling pathways; EP3A is coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, while EP3B and EP3C are coupled to its stimulation and EP3D is coupled to phosphatidylinositol turnover, in addition to the adenylate cyclase system (Namba, T., Sugimoto, Y., Negishi, M., Irie, A., Ushikubi, F., Kakizuka, Ito, S., A., Ichikawa, A., and Narumiya, S. (1993) Nature 365, 166-170). We examined here the identity of coupled G proteins and their regulation by one of the isoforms, EP3C, in the membranes of EP3C cDNA-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. M&B 28767, an EP3 agonist, stimulated the GTPase activity in the pertussis toxin (PT)-treated cell membrane, but inhibited it in the cholera toxin (CT)-treated cell membrane, while the agonist neither stimulated nor inhibited it in the both PT- and CT-treated cell membrane. In the PT- and CT-treated cell membrane reconstituted with various G proteins, M&B 28767 inhibited the GTPase activity of G(o), but stimulated that of Gs. On the other hand, M&B 28767 did not affect the GTPase activity of Gi1, Gi2, or Gi3. M&B 28767 increased the apparent affinity of G(o) for GDP without any change in that for GTP, as assessed by displacement of [35S]GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)) binding to G(o). In contrast, M&B 28767 increased the apparent affinity of Gs for GTP but decreased that for GDP. These results demonstrated that the EP3 receptor isoform is coupled to two different G proteins, and oppositely regulates their activities, inhibition of G(o), and stimulation of Gs."
https://openalex.org/W1547017183,"3H-Labeled inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) binding sites are observed on nuclei isolated from rat liver and devoid of any microsomal, mitochondrial, or plasma membrane constituents. A pH of about 6.5 is found optimum for maximum [3H]IP4 specific binding that is sensitive to changes in pH. The [3H]IP4 binding on the nuclei can be distinguished into a high affinity site and a low affinity site. The two binding sites are characterized by distinct KD and Bmax (1.6 nM versus 57.0 nM KD; 0.25 pmol/mg protein and 3.7 pmol/mg protein Bmax). IP4 is capable of 45Ca2+ uptake even in the absence of ATP. The calcium uptake by nuclei is highly sensitive to IP4 since it is achieved even at 1 nM IP4 concentration. Furthermore, data are documented demonstrating that a rapid and transient 45Ca2+ release by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) from the intact nuclei can be reversed by IP4. The presence of IP3 potentiates the action of IP4 in nuclear calcium reuptake as attested by the rate of calcium uptake by IP4 in the absence of IP3 (0.16 nmol/s/mg of protein) and n the presence of IP3 (4.0 nmol/s/mg of protein). A novel mechanism of nuclear calcium signaling is proposed where IP4 brings calcium into the nuclei mediated by its specific putative binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1555091181,"The beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase is a trans Golgi/trans Golgi network glycosyltransferase which adds sialic acid residues to Asn-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. Previous results suggested that the sialyltransferase stem and signal anchor including flanking sequences may be two independent Golgi retention regions. However, other experiments demonstrated that the sequence of the signal anchor itself was not important. To investigate whether the sialyltransferase signal anchor was necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention, several mutant and chimeric proteins were expressed and localized in Cos-1 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. We found that the signal anchor and flanking sequences were able to retain the sialyltransferase catalytic domain in the Golgi. However, efficient Golgi retention was still observed when the signal anchor was altered or entirely replaced in either the presence or absence of most of the luminal stem region. Chimeric proteins consisting of the sialyltransferase cytoplasmic tail and signal anchor fused to the extracellular domains of two different cell surface proteins demonstrated poor Golgi retention. A significant increase in the Golgi retention of one of these chimeras was observed when two lysines were placed next to the signal anchor on the luminal side. Taken together these results suggest that the sialyltransferase signal anchor is not necessary or sufficient for Golgi retention, rather, appropriately spaced cytoplasmic and luminal flanking sequences are the important elements of the sialyltransferase Golgi retention region."
https://openalex.org/W1599783101,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-associated invariant chain (Ii) gene and the MHC class II molecules are physically and functionally associated within class II-expressing cell types. These genes are generally co-expressed in various cell types and coordinately induced by cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Human Ii gene shares a regulatory mechanism with MHC class II genes via the X and Y cis-acting elements. Ii X and Y are required for constitutive expression in B lymphoid cell lines and for induction by IFN-gamma in a glioblastoma cell line. The Servenius element (S) contributes 5-fold transcriptional activity to class II gene HLA-DRA, and an S homologue has been implied in Ii gene regulation. Now we report that along with X and Y, the Ii S box functions in a positive manner to regulate Ii transcription in B cell lines but not in T cell lines. In addition, S,X, and Y are all necessary for induced expression of Ii in an IFN-gamma-regulated glioblastoma cell line and in primary untransformed glial cells. Transcriptional activity of Ii X and Y elements correlates with the presence of in vivo protein/DNA interactions in Ii-expressing cells. Most interestingly, in vivo interactions are induced upon IFN-gamma induction in a time-dependent fashion. Thus, the Ii promoter contains elements that coordinately regulate expression with the MHC class II genes, and these functional sites are contacted in vivo emphasizing their importance in Ii gene transcription."

RUSA208 is a member of a cluster of Tn551 mutants located on fragment A of SmaI digests but is distinct from the femA and femB class of mutants. The peptidoglycan of RUSA208 contained normal parental muropeptides but in diminished amounts only. The major muropeptides of RUSA208 were new components eluting with somewhat longer retention times from the column. Amino acid analysis of these new muropeptides showed identical compositions to the corresponding peaks in the parental strain, but mass spectrometry revealed increased molecular weights by the following mass units: 1 (in monomers), 1 or 2 (in dimers), and 2 or 3 (in trimers). These observations suggest that in RUSA208 the mutational block may be in the amidation of the stem peptide glutamate residues, resulting in the replacement of isoglutamine with free glutamic acid in one or more of the cell wall stem peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1528699463,"Oxidative metabolism in the in vivo canine myocardium was studied noninvasively using 13C-enriched acetate and non-steady state 13C NMR techniques. Under low workload conditions, the myocardium oxidized the infused [2-13C]acetate and incorporated the labeled carbon into the glutamate pool as expected. This conclusion stems from the rapid enrichment of the C-2, C-3, and C-4 carbons of glutamic acid both under in vivo conditions and in extracts. Surprisingly, [2-13C]acetate uptake was not observed at high workloads as reflected by an absence of glutamate pool enrichment at these rate pressure products. Rather, the myocardium selected its substrate from an endogenous pool. Since free acetate can directly cross the inner mitochondrial membrane and be converted to acetyl-CoA through acetyl-CoA synthetase, these results support workload-dependent regulation of substrate access to the mitochondrial CoASH pool. As such, we advance the hypothesis that the selection of substrate for condensation with CoASH and subsequent oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid cycle is regulated kinetically through the Km values of the appropriate condensation enzymes and through the absolute levels of free CoASH in the mitochondria."

Here we report on the identification of 3(R)-hydroxy-4(R)-methyl-6(E)-octenoic acid as the end product of the first phase. The primary indication of 3(R)-hydroxy-4(R)-methyl-6(E)-octenoic acid as the key intermediate in the proposed biosynthetic route came from in vivo labeling studies with [1-13C,18O2]acetate, demonstrating retention of 18O in the 3-hydroxy group. Final identification of this intermediate in in vitro polyketide assays with enriched enzyme fractions of Tolypocladium niveum was achieved after development of highly sensitive and specific detection methods and by use of synthetic reference substances. Two additional methylated in vitro products could be detected and characterized as 4(R)-methyl-(E,E)-2,6-octadienoic acid and 4(R)-methyl-6(E)-octenoic acid by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and comparison with synthetic reference samples. Their relevance for Bmt biosynthesis is discussed. Bmt polyketide synthase shows optimal activity at substrate concentrations of 200 microM acetyl-CoA, 150 microM malonyl-CoA, and 200 microM S-adenosylmethionine, around pH 7 and at 35 degrees C. Interestingly the Bmt backbone is released from the enzyme as a coenzyme A thioester, suggesting that subsequent transformation to Bmt takes place upon this activated intermediate."

Final purification of GM3-synthase was achieved by chromatography on a acid-Sepharose column and specific elution with lactosylceramide. The enzyme activity was highest at pH 6.5 and required the presence of Triton CF-54 (0.15%) and Mn2+ (10 mM) for its full activity. The product of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme was identified as GM3 based on its mobility on thin layer chromatographic plates using two different solvent systems. Comparison with several glycolipid substrates showed high specificity of GM3-synthase for lactosylceramide.

https://openalex.org/W1601561275,"Defects in the androgen receptor cause a spectrum of abnormalities in genetic males ranging from phenotypic women with testicular feminization to men with minor defects in fertility and/or virilization. The diagnosis of androgen resistance can be quite cumbersome, including analysis of the family history, karyotyping, endocrine studies, measurement of androgen binding in genital skin fibroblasts, and, in some instances, sequencing of mutant cDNAs. Furthermore, androgen-binding studies may be normal in patients with qualitative receptor abnormalities or mutations in the DNA-binding domain of the receptor. To circumvent these difficulties, we have used a recombinant adenovirus to deliver an androgen-responsive reporter gene (mouse mammary tumor virus-luciferase) to fibroblasts cultured from genital skin from 12 normal controls and from eight individuals with complete testicular feminization. Following incubation with androgen (2 nM mibolerone) for 72 h, luciferase activity in normal fibroblasts increased > 10-fold (range 11-200-fold) in a manner that corresponded with the level of androgen receptor detected in ligand-binding assays. By contrast, luciferase activity increased negligibly in fibroblasts from individuals with testicular feminization (average = 1.2-fold increase). This assay permits a direct assessment of endogenous androgen receptor function in cells and should be a powerful aid in the diagnosis of androgen resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1496737021,"Binding studies at 37 °C showed that lipoprotein lipase-treated very low density lipoproteins (LPL-VLDL) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), once taken up via the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, are poorly degraded by HepG2 cells as compared with LDL. Determination of the initial endocytotic rate for LPL-VLDL and VLDL as compared to LDL shows that LPL- VLDL and VLDL are internalized at a similar rate as LDL. Incubation of cells with labeled LDL, LPL-VLDL, and VLDL at 18 °C for 4.5 h resulted in the accumulation of these particles in the early endosomes, without subsequent transport to the lysosomes and degradation. After washing the cells and a temperature shift to 37 °C, the labeled LDL present in the early endosomes is transported to the lysosomal compartment almost completely within 15 min. Strikingly, for LPL-VLDL and for VLDL, only about 50% or less of the label was moved to the lysosomal compartment within 45 min. However, once present in the lysosomes, VLDL and LPL-VLDL are degraded about 1.6-fold more rapidly than LDL. Retroendocytosis accounts for less than 10% of the internalized LDL, whereas a higher rate of retroendocytosis, up to 20 and 40%, respectively, was observed for LPL-VLDL and VLDL. To evaluate the effect of the inefficient transport of VLDL and LPL-VLDL to the lysosomal compartment on cellular cholesterol homeostasis, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity was measured. Incubation with 30 μg/ml of LDL induced a 2.5- fold increase in ACAT activity, whereas the incubation with similar amounts of both VLDL and LPL-VLDL failed to stimulate this enzyme. We conclude that both a slower transport to the lysosomal compartment and a higher rate of retroendocytosis, possibly as the consequence of the longer residence time in the early endosomes, are responsible for the poor degradation of VLDL and LPL-VLDL by HepG2 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1582432821,"When the precursor to mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (pmAspAT) is synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system (RRL), its properties are quite unlike those of the purified protein (Mattingly, J.R., Jr., Youssef, J., Iriarte, A., and Martinez-Carrion, M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3925-3937). These results suggest that molecular chaperones present in RRL modulate the folding of pmAspAT. To investigate the structural basis for this, we have used protease resistance to monitor the extent of folding for several related AspATs after synthesis in RRL and in wheat germ extract (WGE). In addition to pmAspAT, the following proteins were examined: the mature form of pmAspAT (delta 2-28 pmAspAT), its cytosolic counterpart (cAspAT), a chimeric protein consisting of the presequence of pmAspAT attached to the amino terminus of cAspAT (pcAspAT), and a pmAspAT variant in which the presequence and the amino-terminal domain of the mature enzyme are deleted (delta 2-57 pmAspAT). In RRL, delta 2-28 pmAspAT folds somewhat faster than intact pmAspAT, whereas the truncated delta 2-57 pmAspAT is unable to fold. In contrast, cAspAT and pcAspAT both fold with extreme rapidity. After synthesis in WGE, pmAspAT and delta 2-28 pmAspAT never acquire a protease-resistant conformation, whereas the folding of cAspAT and pcAspAT still occurs rapidly. We conclude that the presequence has only a minor role in determining the folding rate of the pmAspAT mitochondrial precursor protein in RRL or WGE and has no influence on the folding of the homologous cAspAT. Rather, the primary sequence of the mature part of the protein seems to dictate whether or how molecular chaperones regulate folding events."
https://openalex.org/W1534709623,"Transplasma membrane redox activity of HL-60 cells was determined by measuring the prevention of ascorbate chemical oxidation. The ascorbate free radical produced as the first step of ascorbate oxidation was reduced back by the transplasma membrane electron transport system, causing then the regeneration of extracellular ascorbate. Agents that increase intracellular cAMP, such as forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP), increased the rate of ascorbate regeneration by HL-60 cells. Also, the phosphodiesterase-resistant cAMP analogue Sp-cAMP-S (agonist of the protein kinase A) increased the electron flow to the ascorbate free radical at the plasma membrane. Rp-cAMP-S, antagonist of the protein kinase A, partially inhibited the redox activity of cells and abolished the effect of Sp-cAMP-S. Inhibition obtained after preincubation of cells in Rp-cAMP-S was reversed by Sp-cAMP-S. Tunicamycin, a compound that inhibited the electron flow to the ascorbate free radical at the plasma membrane, also reduced the response of transplasma membrane redox system to Sp-cAMP-S. Lactate slightly affected the ascorbate regeneration in nonstimulated cells, but showed a significant effect on Sp-cAMP-S-stimulated plasma membrane electron flow. We show here a role for cAMP in the short-term modulation of transplasma membrane redox system measured as the regeneration of ascorbate at the cell surface of HL-60 cells, probably mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinases."

We have investigated the mitogenic signaling reactions induced by CGF using quiescent human gingival fibroblasts as target cells. Cells activated with CGF were compared with those treated with CGF plus epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other growth factors. CGF caused a transient increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, and this was accompanied by enhancement of membrane protein kinase C activity, myelin basic protein and S6 kinase activities, inositol phosphate levels, and activation of c-fos and jun-B gene expression. Membranes obtained from cells activated with CGF contained several protein bands, which cross-reacted with antiphosphotyrosine antibody; however, proteins corresponding to a putative phosphorylated CGF receptor were not detected. DNA synthesis induced by CGF was inhibited by 65% in cells treated with pertussis toxin but only 25-29% in cultures exposed to H7 or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; these values were different from those obtained when EGF, PDGF, or fetal bovine serum were used as mitogens. CGF and TGF-beta, but not EGF, caused an increase of PDGF-A chain mRNA expression 4 h after mitogen addition. However, while CGF was mitogenic for gingival fibroblasts, TGF-beta was not. Kinetics of DNA stimulation and experiments with anti-PDGF antibodies indicated that PDGF-A expression does not contribute significantly to CGF-induced DNA synthesis. When the stimulation of various signaling pathways induced by CGF and other growth factors was compared, the pattern of stimulation by CGF was different from other growth factors. The characteristic signaling reactions of CGF are likely to be important components of the mechanisms that regulate the formation and regeneration of cementum and adjacent connective tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1541001862,"The binding of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component and the E1-specific kinase to the core-forming dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component facilitates a severalfold enhancement in the rate at which the kinase phosphorylate E1 (i.e. versus free kinase phosphorylating free E1). The kinase and E1 associate with small exterior linker region-connected domains in the E2 structure. The kinase binds to one of two lipoyl domains, and the E1 component binds to a domain in E2s structure between the lipoyl domain region and the inner domain. Sixty of the latter domains assemble to form a dodecahedron-shaped inner core. Binding of the kinase to a detached lipoyl domain region enhanced kinase activity. This bi-lipoyl domain fragment induced a 2-fold enhancement in the slow rate of phosphorylation of peptide substrate and intact E260 gave only a 50% higher rate. In contrast, the lipoyl domain fragment gave only a 40% enhancement in the faster rate of phosphorylation of E1; whereas the rate of phosphorylation of E1 was markedly increased (4-10-fold depending on conditions) by kinase interaction with the intact E2 core. Binding of E1 to an E2 structure lacking only the bi-lipoyl domain region did not enhance kinase activity. Thus, binding of the kinase to the lipoyl domain region elicits a structural change which enhances kinase activity; however, other processes are required to explain the very large enhancement in phosphorylation of E1 effected by intact E2 core. Among the latter is a need for a mechanism allowing one kinase molecule to phosphorylate many E1 tetramers, whereas both E1 and the kinase stay bound to the oligomeric E2 core (i.e. phosphorylation appears to be much faster than the dissociation of either the kinase or E1 tetramers from E260 core). Exposure of kinase bound to the lipoyl domain fragment to intact E2 core for 10 s allowed a transition to a maximal (7-fold) activation of the kinase. In the opposite direction, an increasing level of the free bi-lipoyl domain fragment rapidly reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner the activity of kinase bound initially to intact E2. The data strongly support kinase transfer between free lipoyl domains and the intact E2 core and fit about a 12-fold tighter binding of the kinase to intact E2 cores over binding to free lipoyl domains. Such an interchange of the kinase between these E2 structures was confirmed by sucrose gradient studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

When placed under the control of a T7 promoter, napA could be transcribed and labeled specifically with [35S]methionine. The resultant gene product exhibited an apparent M(r) of 3,4 x 10(4) when subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The function of NapA was tested by expressing it from its own promoter in the E. coli mutant EP432. This mutant lacks both of the endemic NaH-antiporters, NhaA and NhaB; its growth is thus very sensitive to Na+ and Li+ and membranes derived from this strain do not exhibit NaH-antiport activity. When complemented with napA, EP432 gained tolerance to Na+ or Li+. Membranes prepared from the complemented mutant exhibited NaH-antiport activity. The properties of this activity were determined by acridine fluorescence measurements on vesicles energized with lactate. The NaH-antiporter expressed by napA exhibited a Km of 1 mM for Na+ and 0.1 mM for Li+ at pH 7.5. At pH 8.5, the relative rate of NaH-antiport activity was 50%, with little change in the Km, and approached zero at pH 9. These results demonstrate that napA is the structural gene for the NaH-antiporter of E. hirae. NapA exhibits properties different from those of the two E. coli NaH-antiporters encoded by nhaA and nhaB, yet functionally complements a defect in these genes."

P., and Reboud, J. P. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 20911-20916). It is shown here that this oxidation prevents neither GTP binding to eEF-2 nor the formation of the ribosome-eEF-2-GPP(NH)P complex, but that oxidized eEF-2 is no longer able to protect ribosomes against ricin inactivation. These observations suggest that Trp221 or an amino-acid sequence containing this residue interacts with the 28 S rRNA loop including the GAGA sequence, which is the target of ricin. Such a hypothesis is discussed in relation with data on RNA recognition motifs described in different proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1915523163,"In vertebrate hemoglobins, changes in protein tertiary structure induced by either ligand binding or changes in quaternary state are manifested at the heme as reflected in resonance Raman spectral changes involving the iron-proximal histidine stretching mode. No such changes are observed for Lumbricus terrestris hemoglobin. The iron-histidine stretching mode and the porphyrin breathing motion in the deoxy-, oxy-, or CO-photodissociated forms of Lumbricus hemoglobin and human hemoglobin A (pH 7.0 and 9.2, the latter to effect Lumbricus hemoglobin subunit dissociation) were studied using pulsed (10 ns) light at 435 nm. In contrast to that observed for hemoglobin A, a comparison of the spectra of the deoxy and photoproduct forms of Lumbricus hemoglobin reveal minimal differences in the region of the iron-histidine and the pi electron distribution in the heme moiety. The spectral frequencies are similar to that observed in R-state vertebrate hemoglobins. Such average behavior of the approximately 192 hemes present in Lumbricus hemoglobin is more analogous to the Raman spectral properties observed in myoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1573142409,"We have used circular dichroism as a probe to characterize the solution conformational changes in RecA protein upon binding to DNA. This approach revealed that RecA protein acquires significant amounts of alpha-helix upon interaction with DNA. These observations, consistent with the data from crystal structure (Story, R. M., Weber, I., and Steitz, T. (1992) Nature 355, 318-325), support the notion that some basic domains including the DNA binding motifs of RecA protein are unstructured and might contribute to the formation of alpha-helix. A comparison of nucleoprotein filaments comprised of RecA protein and a variety of DNA substrates revealed important structural heterogeneity. The most significant difference was observed with poly(dG). poly(dC) and related polymers, rich in GC sequences, which induced minimal amounts of alpha-helix in RecA protein. The magnitude of induction of alpha-helix in RecA protein, which occurred concomitant with the production of ternary complexes, was 2-fold higher with homologous than heterologous duplex DNA. Most importantly, the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by high salt coincided with that of the induction of alpha-helix in RecA protein. These conformational differences provide a basis for thinking about the biochemical and structural transitions that RecA protein experiences during the formal steps of presynapsis, recognition, and alignment of homologous sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1539346124,"We report that in activated human T-lymphoblasts synchronized early in the G1-phase of the cell cycle, addition of interleukin 2 (IL-2) stimulates transition into S-phase in conjunction with specific and reproducible protein tyrosine phosphorylation events. Prominent among these was de novo phosphorylation of the p56lck tyrosine kinase, which appeared as a single polypeptide on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to the addition of IL-2, but as a doublet of approximately 56 and 59 kDa 3 h after IL-2 addition. Although the lck polypeptide doublet persisted into S-phase, the 59-kDa form was virtually undetectable in T-lymphoblasts in log phase growth. In T-lymphoblasts metabolically labeled with 32Pi, antiphosphotyrosine antisera identified a major 56-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, whereas antisera to lck showed that phosphorylation of lck occurred on both the 56- and 59-kDa forms. Phosphoamino acid analyses identified phosphoserine as the major phosphoamino acid on both of the lck polypeptides, although small amounts of phosphotyrosine were also detected on the 56-kDa form. Immune complex kinase assays revealed that only the lower band of the lck doublet exhibited autocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the 59-kDa form neither displayed autocatalytic activity, nor was it a substrate for phosphorylation by the 56-kDa form. We conclude that entry into S-phase in activated human T-lymphoblasts is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of a limited number of proteins and suggest that p56lck activity is regulated during G1/S."
