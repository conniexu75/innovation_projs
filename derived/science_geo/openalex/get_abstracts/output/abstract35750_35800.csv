https://openalex.org/W1981457569,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a nuclear trans-activator, termed Rev, that is required for the expression of the viral structural proteins and, hence, for viral replication. The Rev protein acts posttranscriptionally to induce the sequence-specific nuclear export of unspliced HIV-1 mRNA species that are otherwise excluded from the cell cytoplasm. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify two distinct regions of the HIV-1 Rev protein that are required for in vivo biological activity. The larger and more N-terminal of these two regions includes, but extends beyond, an arginine-rich sequence element required for nuclear localization. Mutation of a second, more C-terminal Rev protein sequence element was found to yield defective Rev proteins that act as trans-dominant inhibitors of Rev function. These Rev mutants are shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication when expressed in transfected cells and may have potential application in the treatment of HIV-1 related disease."
https://openalex.org/W1988158019,"The effect of peptide chemoattractants on neutrophil mechanical properties was studied to test the hypothesis that stimulated neutrophils (diameter, 8 micrometers) are retained in pulmonary capillaries (5.5 micrometers) as a result of a decreased ability of the cell to deform within the capillary in response to the hydrodynamic forces of the bloodstream. Increased neutrophil stiffness, actin assembly, and retention in both 5-micrometer pores and the pulmonary vasculature were seen in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. These changes were abolished in cells that had been incubated with 2 micromolar cytochalasin D, an agent that disrupts cellular actin organization. A monoclonal antibody directed at the CD11-CD18 adhesive glycoprotein complex did not inhibit the increase in stiffness or retention in pores. These data suggest that neutrophil stiffening may be both necessary and sufficient for the retention that is observed. Hence, neutrophil sequestration in lung and other capillaries in the acute inflammatory process may be the result of increased stiffness stimulated by chemoattractants."
https://openalex.org/W2160225986,"Iron regulates human transferrin receptor (hTR) expression by modulating the stability of cytoplasmic hTR mRNA. This regulation requires a distinct secondary structure in the mRNA 3′ untranslated region. We identified a specific cytoplasmic factor that binds simultaneously to four homologous palindromes within the regulatory domain. Iron chelator induced the RNA binding activity 25-fold in parallel with mRNA. Upon the addition of iron salts, a rapid decay of factor activity closely preceded hTR mRNA degradation, indicating a causal relation. Induction and decay occurred posttranscriptionally. Binding of the factor to hTR mRNA palindromes was competed by 5′ regulatory sequences of ferritin mRNA, which are responsible for iron-dependent translational control. These results suggest that cellular iron maintains its homeostasis by coordinate regulation of hTR and ferritin expression via a common factor."
https://openalex.org/W2024490989,"Neurons and support cells of each sensory organ in Drosophila embryos are most likely derived from a single precursor cell. This cell lineage is affected in numb mutants. Morphological alterations of sensory structures, as well as changes in the number of cells expressing cell type-specific markers, indicate that sensory neurons in numb mutant embryos are transformed into lineage-related nonneuronal support cells. Thus the numb gene controls the fate of progeny derived from sensory organ precursors. The numb gene has been isolated by the plasmid rescue method. The structure of its predicted product is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2050199375,"We describe a scheme for the purification of the nonclathrin-coated vesicles that mediate transport of proteins between Golgi cisternae and probably from ER to Golgi. These ""Golgi-derived coated vesicles"" accumulate when Golgi membranes are incubated with ATP and cytosol in the presence of GTP gamma S, a compound that blocks vesicle fusion. The coated vesicles dissociate from the Golgi cisternae in high salt and can then be purified by employing differential and density gradient centrifugation. Golgi-derived coated vesicles have a putative polypeptide composition that is distinct from both cytosol and Golgi membranes, as well as from that of clathrin-coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2115675121,"The cement gland is an ectodermal organ in the head of frog embryos, lying anterior to any neural tissue. As analyzed by specific RNA expression, cement gland, like neural tissue, was induced by the dorsal mesoderm. Interestingly, mesoderm with the highest cement gland-inducing potential lay posterior to the ectoderm fated to form this organ, indicating that its induction occurred at a distance from the inducer source. Cement gland induction first occurred during early gastrulation. However, most initially induced cells did not contribute to the mature cement gland, but instead formed part of the neural plate. This change in fate could be reconstituted in vitro. These results suggest that determination of part of the anteroposterior axis occurs progressively, where future neural ectoderm is first induced to a cement gland-like state. As gastrulation proceeds, further induction by mesoderm may override this state, which persists only in the extreme anterior of the embryo."

https://openalex.org/W2035257545,"In a transcription system using a HeLa cell mitochondrial lysate programmed by mitochondrial DNA constructs containing the main heavy strand promoter and the transcription termination site at the 16S rRNA/leucyl-tRNA boundary, an appreciable fraction of the heavy strand transcripts terminates at this site, as it does in vivo. A DNA binding protein(s) that protects a 28 bp region immediately adjacent and downstream of the 3' ends of the in vivo and in vitro transcripts has been identified in the lysate and highly purified on an oligodeoxynucleotide affinity column. An activity promoting specific termination of heavy strand transcripts copurified with the DNA binding protein(s), pointing to the involvement of this protein in transcription termination. A distinctive modification of the footprint not correlated with terminating activity has also been observed."
https://openalex.org/W2042837551,"The periaqueductal gray matter of the mesencephalon (PAG) subserves a variety of diverse autonomic functions and also appears to be a site for opiate action in the induction of immunosuppression. Microinjections of morphine into the PAG, but not into other opiate receptor-containing neuroanatomical sites, result in a rapid suppression of natural killer (NK) cell activity. The NK cell suppression can be blocked by prior peripheral administration of the opiate antagonist naltrexone. These findings demonstrate that certain central actions of opiates that produce changes in NK cell function are mediated through opiate receptors in the PAG and identify a brain region involved in opiate regulation of immune function."
https://openalex.org/W2101852310,"The human U2 snRNA promoter directs the formation of a specialized RNA polymerase II transcription complex that recognizes the snRNA gene 3′ box as a signal for RNA 3′ end formation. In contrast, the human U6 promoter is recognized by RNA polymerase III and transcription terminates in a run of Ts. We show that transcription from the U6 promoter is dependent on a sequence similar to the U2 proximal element and on an AT-rich element centered around position −27. Mutation of the AT-rich element induces RNA polymerase II transcription from the U6 promoter, whereas insertion of this element within the U2 promoter converts it into a predominantly RNA polymerase III promoter. The site of transcription termination always correlates with the nature of the transcribing polymerase: the 3′ box with RNA polymerase II and a run of Ts with RNA polymerase III. Thus, a single element determines the RNA polymerase specificity of snRNA promoters and hence the site of transcription termination."
https://openalex.org/W2119125001,"The HIV-1 Tat protein is a potent trans-activator essential for virus replication. We reported previously that HIV-1 Tat peptides containing residues 37–48 (mainly region II), a possible activating region, and residues 49–57 (region III), a nuclear targeting and putative nucleic acid binding region, possess minimal but distinct trans-activator activity. The presence of residues 58–72 (region IV) greatly enhances trans-activation. We postulate that Tat mutant peptides with an inactive region II and a functional region III can behave as dominant negative mutants. We synthesized minimal domain peptides containing single amino substitutions for amino acid residues within region II that are conserved among different HIV isolates. We identify four amino acid residues whose substitution within Tat minimal domain peptides leads to defects in trans-activation. Some of these mutants are trans-dominant in several peptide backbones, since they strongly inhibit trans-activation by wild-type Tat protein added to cells or expressed from microinjected plasmid. Significantly, trans-activation of integrated HIV-LTRCAT is blocked by some trans-dominant mutant peptides. These results suggest an attractive approach for the development of an AIDS therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2036119791,"Nearly 20 percent of the packaged RNA in bean-pod mottle virus (BPMV) binds to the capsid interior in a symmetric fashion and is clearly visible in the electron density map. The RNA displaying icosahedral symmetry is single-stranded with well-defined polarity and stereochemical properties. Interactions with protein are dominated by nonbonding forces with few specific contacts. The tertiary and quaternary structures of the BPMV capsid proteins are similar to those observed in animal picornaviruses, supporting the close relation between plant comoviruses and animal picornaviruses established by previous biological studies."
https://openalex.org/W1996617275,"Neural connections were established in cocultures of rat visual cortex (VC) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), which were isolated in early infancy. Morphological and electrophysiological studies showed that the cortical laminar organization of afferent and efferent connections in the coculture preparations was similar to that in the adult VC. The results indicate the existence of intrinsic mechanisms in VC and LGN that guide the formation of synaptic connections with the appropriate targets."
https://openalex.org/W2048112503,"The majority of pheromones identified to date are insect pheromones, which are volatile in nature. Identification of nonvolatile pheromones have been relatively rare, especially in vertebrates. Male and female garter snakes use pheromones to mediate sexual behavior. The female sex attractiveness pheromone of the Canadian red-sided garter snake, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, consists of a novel series of nonvolatile saturated and monounsaturated long-chain methyl ketones, whereas the male sex recognition pheromone contains squalene. These compounds were isolated, identified, and partially synthesized, and field tests show them to be biologically active."
https://openalex.org/W1567707787,"A near full-length cDNA and three genomic clones for rice (Oryza sativa L.) glutelin were isolated and studied. Based on nucleic acid sequence and Southern blot analyses, the three isolated glutelin genomic clones were representative members of three gene subfamilies each containing five to eight copies. A comparison of DNA sequences displayed by relevant regions of these genomic clones showed that two subfamilies, represented by clones Gt1 and Gt2, were closely related and evolved by more recent gene duplication events. The 5'-flanking and coding sequences of Gt1 and Gt2 displayed at least 87% homology. In contrast, Gt3 showed little or no homology in the 5'-flanking sequences upstream of the putative CAAT boxes and exhibited significant divergence in all other portions of the gene. Conserved sequences in the 5'-flanking regions of these genes were identified and discussed in light of their potential regulatory role. The derived primary sequences of all three glutelin genomic clones showed significant homology to the legume 11 S storage proteins indicating a common gene origin. A comparison of the derived glutelin primary sequences showed that mutations were clustered in three peptide regions. One peptide region corresponded to the highly mutable hypervariable region of legume 11 S storage proteins, a potential target area for protein modification. Expression studies indicated that glutelin mRNA transcripts are differentially accumulated during endosperm development. Promoters of Gt2 and Gt3 were functional as they direct transient expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in cultured plant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1647167187,"We have examined the requirements for the export of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) from cultured human eosinophils. To define saturability and kinetics of LTC4 export, eosinophils were interacted with leukotriene A4 (LTA4) at 37 degrees C, and the methanolic extracts of the cell-associated and extracellular compartments were then analyzed for LTC4 content by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with on-line monitoring of absorbance at 280 nm. When LTA4 was added at concentrations from 0 to 100 microM for 10 min at 37 degrees C, the amount of LTC4 released extracellularly became constant at an LTA4 concentration of 7.5 microM or greater even though the amount of intracellular LTC4 continued to increase. When eosinophils were incubated with 50 microM LTA4 for 0-60 min at 37 degrees C and then held at 0 degrees C for the remainder of the 60-min interval, 54.2 and 77.3% (n = 3), respectively, of the total LTC4 was released extracellularly after 15 and 30 min of incubation at 37 degrees C. Eosinophils incubated with 50 microM LTA4 at 0 degrees C for 1 h synthesized 290 pmol of LTC4 (n = 3) which was approximately half-maximal, all of which was retained intracellularly. We utilized the time and temperature dependence of LTC4 export to preload eosinophils with both LTC4 and leukotriene C5 (LTC5) by sequentially supplying them with specific substrates. With increasing concentrations of intracellular LTC5, there was dose-dependent inhibition of the subsequent release of LTC4 at 37 degrees C, with the sum of the released glutathionyl leukotrienes remaining constant. In addition, only minimal competition for LTC4 release occurred when cells were preloaded with both LTC4 and the conjugate of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and reduced glutathione, S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione. The criteria of saturability, time dependence of LTC4 release at 37 degrees C, competition of LTC4 with LTC5 for release, and the inhibition of LTC4 release at 0 degrees C establish the export of LTC4 from cells as a novel and specific biochemical step distinct from both LTA4 uptake and the conjugation of LTA4 with reduced glutathione by LTC4 synthase to form LTC4."
https://openalex.org/W1602530349,"Starved rats were infused intragastrically via indwelling duodenal cannulae with glucose at a rate of 30 mg/min/kg. The infusate contained [U-13C]glucose at an enrichment of 32 or 17%. At the end of the infusion, after 160 min, glucose and lactate were isolated from arterial and portal blood and from liver, and liver glycogen was isolated and hydrolyzed to glucose. The enrichment in glucose and lactate and the isotopomer distribution in glucose of masses from 180 to 186 were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). From analysis of these data we determined (a) gluconeogenesis proceeds at half the basal rate in the presence of a large infused glucose load, (b) one-quarter of the hepatic pyruvate pool is derived from nonglucose carbon, (c) half of the labeled molecules in liver glycogen are of mass 186 from the infused glucose and half are of masses 181-183, (d) the contribution of the indirect path from pyruvate when corrected for synthesis from unlabeled pyruvate ranges from 55 to 65%, (e) the rate of pyruvate carboxylase averages 90% that of citrate synthase, and (f) the rate of exchange of oxaloacetate with fumarate is about three times the rate of flux in the Krebs cycle (four times in the forward direction), and the enrichment in carbon 1 of oxaloacetate was 2.3 times that in carbon 4. In the Appendix a method to obtain the isotopomer distribution of newly formed glucose and glycogen glucose is described. An algorithm to correct for the contribution of natural abundance of 13C and the presence of 12C in commercial [U-13C]glucose is presented. A novel mathematical analysis to obtain the parameters of the Krebs cycle from the isotopomer distribution is developed in the Appendix. Equations to calculate the relative rates of pyruvate carboxylase (y), and the equilibration of oxaloacetate with fumarate from the isotopomer distribution are derived. Mass isotopomer analysis provides a novel and powerful tool for the study of carbohydrate metabolism and the operation of the Krebs cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1579383379,"Abstract Recently, we have described a COOH-terminal deletion mutation of the human insulin receptor (HIR delta CT) that exhibits normal insulin-mediated kinase activity and endocytosis, but is inefficient in stimulating glucose transport and glycogen synthase (McClain, D. A., Maegawa, H., Levy, J., Huecksteadt, T., Dull, T. J., Lee, J., Ullrich, A., and Olefsky, J.M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8904-8911; Maegawa, H., McClain, D. A., Freidenberg, G., Olefsky, J. M., Napier, M., Lipari, T., Dull, T. J., Lee, J., and Ullrich, A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8912-8917). In this paper, we report that despite this defect in metabolic signaling, the truncated receptor exhibits augmented mitogenic activity compared to normal receptors. These results were verified in three independently isolated clones of Rat 1 fibroblasts transfected with the HIR delta CT cDNA. The increase in insulin sensitivity of mitogenic stimulation was proportional to the number of HIR delta CT receptors expressed on the cells. By contrast, only the cells with normal receptors and none of the HIR delta CT clones exhibit increased sensitivity for a metabolic action of insulin, the stimulation of glucose uptake. Stimulation of cells by other mitogens and autoradiographic analysis confirm that the enhanced mitogenic effects seen in HIR delta CT cells are attributable only to the presence of the truncated insulin receptors. These receptors mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins, and the pattern of these phosphorylations differs quantitatively from that seen in cells with normal receptors. We conclude: 1) The COOH terminus plays a role in signaling metabolic actions of insulin, perhaps through its recognition of substrates for the receptor kinase. 2) By contrast, the COOH terminus is an inhibitory regulator of mitogenesis, and removal of the terminal 43 amino acids converts the receptor from a moderately active growth signaler to a very active one. 3) The changes seen in biologic activities of the HIR delta CT receptor are associated with quantitative changes in substrate phosphorylation by the receptor kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1547900247,"Abstract In the rat, a cytosolic isozyme of aldehyde dehydrogenase, designated ALDH-PB, can be induced in the liver by administration of phenobarbital (PB). ALDH-PB activity and mRNA are induced in Long-Evans rats that possess a responsive (R) allele but are not induced in homozygous nonresponsive rats (rr), although the rr genotype is competent to induce other PB-responsive mRNAs. ALDH-PB mRNA is expressed in the basal state (without PB administration) in hepatic tissue in both RR and rr genotypes. We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the rat ALDH-PB mRNA. The protein encoded by the ALDH-PB mRNA is 501 amino acids in length and has a predicted molecular mass of 54,540 daltons. The amino acid sequence predicted from the mRNA demonstrates a strong conservation between the rat ALDH-PB and the human cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase hALDH-1. We demonstrate the ALDH-PB, cytochrome P-450b, cytochrome P-450e, and glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit mRNA levels in the liver are altered noncoordinately by administration of PB in RR and rr genotypes. The strikingly different responses to PB administration between the various mRNA species in each of the genotypes suggest that the regulation of specific gene expression by PB may involve multiple pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1594263537,"Abstract A second form (form 2) of glycosylated esterase was isolated from liver microsomal membranes and characterized. The subunit molecular weight of form 2 is identical to that of the 60-kDa protein previously reported (Ozols, J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15316-15321). The NH2 terminus of the form 2 enzyme is blocked. Digestion of form 2 with pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase, followed by electroblotting and sequence analysis of the blotted protein, indicated that a pyroglutamyl residue was located at the NH2 terminus. Sequence analysis of the deblocked protein as well as characterization of the peptides obtained from enzymatic and chemical cleavages of the intact protein led to the elucidation of its complete amino acid sequence. The protein is a single polypeptide consisting of 532 residues. Carbohydrate is attached at asparaginyl residue 249. The sequence of form 2 esterase is 50% identical to the sequence of form 1 enzyme. The amino acid sequence of the first 26 residues of form 1 enzyme from human liver microsomes shows that 23 residues are identical to that of rabbit form 1, but only 8 residues that are identical to form 2. Treatment of the forms 1 and 2 isozymes with N-glycosidase F or endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H resulted in a decrease of their subunit molecular weights, indicating that the carbohydrate attached is of the high mannose type. To determine whether the 60-kDa proteins are located on the cytoplasmic or luminal side of the endoplasmic membrane, microsomes were treated with proteolytic enzymes and the two 60-kDa isozymes were isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis of both proteins indicated that their NH2 termini were unaffected by proteolysis. Form 1 isozyme isolated from trypsin-treated microsomes, however, lacked the COOH-terminal heptapeptide (residues 533-539). These results, in addition to the finding of an N-linked carbohydrate, suggest that the two 60-kDa proteins are oriented on the luminal side of the endoplasmic membrane."

A procedure is described which allows the enrichment of any type of mutant unable to grow under the selection conditions applied. Its use for the isolation of phototrophically negative, retinal-positive mutants of Halobacterium sp. GRB is demonstrated. Single cell clones of this phenotype were further characterized. The expression of bacterioopsin was tested with a monoclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of the protein. The expressed bacteriorhodopsins were characterized by their specific activity for proton pumping, their spectral properties, and photocycle kinetics. About 15 independent mutants carrying bacteriorhodopsins of three distinct phenotypic classes could be isolated, including BR with a different absorption maximum, BR of lower specific activity, and BR characterized by a slower photocycle and a lack of proton pumping activity."

https://openalex.org/W1481073719,"Abstract The structure of the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase has been refined to 2.5 A resolution by the methods of x-ray crystallography from crystals grown at pH 4.8, where the enzyme is optimally active. Models of the active site with and without the bound substrate analog, histidine methyl ester (HisOMe), or the product, histamine, have been produced. Comparison of native and ligand-bound structures reveals no widespread differences in conformation but does reveal motion of a few key residues (Tyr-62', Ile-59', Ser-81) upon binding of HisOMe in the active site. The HisOMe binds with the appropriate alpha-carbon-carbon bond oriented as required to facilitate the formation of the transition state. The binding site contains two pockets, one for the imidazole group, and another for the -COOMe group. In the imidazole pocket, the imidazolium group forms hydrogen bonds with two neighboring carboxylates, Asp-63' and the carboxyl terminus of the beta chain, Ser-81. Hydrophobic contacts are also observed. The carboxylate pocket is predominantly hydrophobic as predicted by Alston and Abeles (Alston, T. A., and Abeles, R. H. (1987) Biochemistry 26,4082-4085), but includes one carboxyl group, that of Glu-197, about 3.5 A from the substrate carboxylate. If Glu-197 is protonated under these conditions, it could serve as the proton donor following decarboxylation; if it is ionized under these conditions, its carboxylate group is appropriately placed to enhance the lability of the substrate carboxylate ion by providing a push in promoting the flow of electrons that results in decarboxylation. These and other structural features of the binding complex are discussed as they relate to a proposed mechanism of decarboxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1516649330,"Abstract The platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex (GP IIb-IIIa) is a member of the integrin receptor family that recognizes adhesive proteins containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence. In the present study the binding characteristics of the synthetic hexapeptide Tyr-Asn-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (YNRGDS, a sequence present in the fibrinogen alpha-chain at position 570-575) to purified GP IIb-IIIa were determined by equilibrium dialysis. The binding of 125I-YNRGDS to GP IIb-IIIa was specific, saturable, and reversible. The apparent dissociation constant was 1.0 +/- 0.2 microM, and the maximal binding capacity was 0.92 +/- 0.02 mol of 125I-YNRGDS/mol of GP IIb-IIIa, indicating that GP IIb-IIIa contains a single binding site for RGD peptides. The binding of 125I-YNRGDS to purified GP IIb-IIIa showed many of the characteristics of fibrinogen binding to activated platelets: the binding was inhibited by fibrinogen, by the monoclonal antibody A2A9, and by the dodecapeptide from the C terminus of the fibrinogen gamma-chain. In addition, the binding of 125I-YNRGDS to GP IIb-IIIa was divalent cation-dependent. Our data suggest that two divalent cation binding sites must be occupied for YNRGDS to bind: one site is specific for calcium and is saturated at 1 microM free Ca2+, whereas the other site is less specific and reaches saturation at millimolar concentrations of either Ca2+ or Mg2+. The results of the present study support the hypothesis that the RGD domains within the adhesive proteins are responsible for their binding to GP IIb-IIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1566279530,"Abnormal levels of endogenous calcium ions are known to induce eye lens opacity, and a variety of causative factors has been proposed, including calcium-mediated aggregation and precipitation of the lens proteins crystallins. We have specifically looked in some detail at the interaction of Ca2+ with various crystallins and its consequences. Lenses incubated in solutions containing 10 mM Ca2+ or 5 mM Tb3+ opacified. Fluorescence titration of crystallins with TbCl3 revealed that this ion binds to delta- and beta-crystallins in solution. Equilibrium dialysis showed that four Ca2+ ions bind to one delta-crystallin tetramer with an affinity of 4.3 x 10(3) M-1. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of delta-crystallin reveals the presence of a calmodulin-type helix-loop-helix or EF-hand calcium ion binding conformational motif in the region comprising residues 300-350. This is a novel feature of the molecule not reported so far. No other crystallins appear to have this motif. beta-Crystallin also binds four Ca2+ ions/aggregate unit of mass 160 kDa, with an affinity of 2.6 x 10(3) M-1, presumably in the midregion of the molecule that is rich in anionic and polar residues. Circular dichroism spectroscopy shows that the binding of calcium ion leads to subtle conformational changes in the molecules, notably in the tertiary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1480600644,"Abstract The occurrence and regulation of 1-ether-linked diradylglycerol in human neutrophils were investigated using a sensitive and practical analytical mass method which distinguishes 1-O-alkyl- (EAG) versus 1-acyl (DAG) diglycerides. After phosphorylation of diglycerides to the corresponding [32P]phosphatidic acids using [gamma-32P]ATP and diglyceride kinase (Preiss, J., Loomis, C. R., Bishop, W. R., Stein, R., Niedel, J. E., and Bell, R. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8597-8600), lipase from Rhizopus arrhizus selectively degraded the 1-acyl-containing species (DAG), but the ether lipid (EAG) was resistant and was identified and quantified after thin layer chromatography separation. By using this method, unstimulated neutrophils were demonstrated to contain both DAG and EAG (100-180 and 40-95 pmol/10(7) cells, respectively). The chemoattractant formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) caused a rapid (30 s) and transient increase (1.6-fold) in DAG, but no increase in EAG. Opsonized zymosan produced a 6-8-fold sustained increase in DAG peaking at 2 to 3 min, but only a small (1.7-fold) increase in EAG which was not seen until later times (10 min). Thus, under these stimulation conditions, the major diglyceride was DAG. However, in neutrophils primed with cytochalasin B or phorbol ester, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine caused a significant increase in EAG. Neutrophils pretreated with cytochalasin B and then stimulated by fMLP showed a rapid (15-60 s) increase (more than 3-fold) in total diglycerides which was sustained beyond 5 min. At the earliest time points (15-30 s), the increase was due almost entirely to DAG (3-fold), but at 1 min and beyond, EAG comprised as much as 40% of the total (up to a 5-fold increase in EAG). Neutrophils pretreated with phorbol ester prior to fMLP stimulation showed a rapid (around 30 s) more than 2-fold increase in both DAG and EAG. Thus, priming conditions (in particular cytochalasin B) may alter either the access of phospholipase(s) C and/or D to membrane phospholipids or may affect their activities, allowing hydrolysis of 1-O-alkyl-containing lipids to generate 1-O-alkyl-containing diglycerides."
https://openalex.org/W1492145829,"Avena seedlings grown in the presence of the plant tetrapyrrole synthesis inhibitor 4-amino-5-hexynoic acid contain less than 10% of the spectrally detectable phytochrome levels found in untreated seedlings, but continue to accumulate phytochrome apoprotein (Elich, T. D., and Lagarias, J. C. (1988) Plant Physiol. 88, 747-761). Using such tetrapyrrole-deficient seedlings, we have previously reported that phycocyanobilin, the cleaved prosthetic group of C-phycocyanin, can be incorporated into phytochrome in vivo to yield spectrally active holoprotein (Elich, T. D., McDonagh, A. F., Palma, L. A., and Lagarias, J. C. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 183-189). Here we show that addition of phycocyanobilin to soluble extracts of inhibitortreated seedlings results in a rapid increase in spectrally active phytochrome holoprotein. The newly formed photoactive species displays a blue-shifted absorbance difference spectrum similar to that observed in the previous in vivo studies. The increase in spectral activity is consistent with conversion of all of the preexisting phytochrome apoprotein to functionally active holoprotein. The formation of a covalent phycocyanobilin-apophytochrome adduct is shown by an increase in Zn2+-dependent bilin fluorescence of the phytochrome polypeptide. A photoreversible, covalent adduct with a similar optical spectrum also forms when immunopurified apophytochrome is incubated with phycocyanobilin. ATP, reduced pyridine nucleotides, or other cofactors are not required for adduct formation. When biliverdin IXa is substituted for phycocyanobilin, no spectrally active covalent adduct is produced. These results indicate that an A-ring ethylidene-containing bilatriene is required for post-translational covalent attachment of bilin to apophytochrome and that apophytochrome may be the bilin C-S lyase which catalyzes bilin attachment. The growth and development of plants is profoundly influenced by light. The best characterized mediator of photomorphogenesis in plants is phytochrome, a soluble pigmented protein which can exist in two spectrally distinct, photointerconvertible forms: Pr,’ the red light-absorbing form; and Pfr,"
https://openalex.org/W2061829999,"Regulation of pulmonary blood flow was studied during voluntary diving in the aquatic file snake, Acrochordus granulatus. Measurements of pressure and blood flow in pulmonary and systemic vessels indicate that blood flow completely bypasses the lung for significant periods during prolonged and quiescent submergence (greater than 30 minutes). When the lung is ventilated, pulmonary blood flow increases to 36 milliliters per minute per kilogram of body mass (measured in the anterior pulmonary artery), and the cardiac output largely bypasses the systemic circulation. These reciprocating patterns of preferential blood flow reflect inverse relations between flow and vascular resistance, with the result that systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures remain virtually constant throughout repetitive dive cycles. Neuropharmacological studies of freely diving snakes and isolated, perfused lung preparations show that pulmonary blood flow is regulated by an interplay of adrenergic vasodilatation and cholinergic vasoconstriction within the densely innervated lung vasculature. The patterns of blood circulation shown by diving Acrochordus reflect an unusual lability of intracardiac shunts."
https://openalex.org/W2038658809,"We have analyzed mixed cultures of normal mammalian fibroblastic cells and transformed quail myoblasts to investigate whether the presence of an excess of normal cells could suppress the phenotype of transformed quail cells. In such mixed cultures, only v-myc-transformed cells were growth-arrested, whereas v-src-transformed myoblasts were essentially unaffected. Growth arrest appeared to reflect reversion from the transformed state, including re-expression of the myogenic differentiation program. The v-myc-transformed myoblasts were phenotypically corrected also by differentiating normal quail myoblasts, giving rise to hybrid myotubes containing nuclei from both cell types. The differential behavior of transformed cells closely paralleled the efficiency with which they established metabolic cooperation with adjacent normal cells. Our results indicate that unrestrained proliferation associated with transformation is responsible for v-myc-induced block of myogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1490575316,"Abstract The monoclonal antibody 75d7, specific for type XII collagen (Sugrue, S.P., Gordon, M.K., Seyer, J., Dublet, B., van der Rest, M., and Olsen, B. R. (1989) J. Cell Biol., in press), was used to characterize the intact form of type XII collagen from chick embryo leg tendons. On an immunoblot of a 6% polyacrylamide gel of tendon extracts, one sharp band is recognized by the antibody at Mr = 220,000, while two fuzzy and poorly resolved bands are seen at Mr = 270,000 and Mr = 290,000. By immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled tendon culture media and electrophoresis of the precipitated material, bands with the same mobilities are observed, indicating that type XII collagen is not proteolytically processed in the extracellular space. Type XII collagen was extracted from tendons with 1 M NaCl in a Tris-HCl buffer and partially purified by concanavalin A-Sepharose and gel permeation chromatographies, using dot immunoblots to monitor the purification. Fractions highly enriched in bacterial collagenase-sensitive proteins with the same electrophoretic properties as type XII collagen were obtained. These fractions did not stain with Alcian blue and neither they nor the immunostained type XII collagen were affected by chondroitinase ABC digestion, indicating that type XII collagen is not a proteoglycan. A disulfide-bonded trimeric CNBr peptide was isolated by affinity chromatography on an antibody column and further purified by gel electrophoresis. Its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was shown to be unique, demonstrating that type XII collagen is a homotrimer [alpha 1 (XII)]3. After bacterial collagenase digestion, both the immunopurified radiolabeled preparation and the purified tendon extract fraction showed by gel electrophoresis the presence of a large disulfide-bonded, 3 x 190-kDa, collagenase-resistant domain. Rotary shadowing and electron microscopy of the purified type XII fraction demonstrated that the molecule has the structure of a cross consisting of a 75 nm collagenase-sensitive tail, a central globule, and three 60 nm arms each ending in a small globule. After heat denaturation and renaturation, only a very large globule can be seen, attached to the triple helical tail. These results show that type XII collagen has a unique structure and is different from the other matrix constituents described so far."
https://openalex.org/W1507764579,"The structure of the octamer d(G-T-G-T-A-C-A-C) was determined in two different crystal forms, tetragonal P43212 and hexagonal P6122. Although in both forms the octamer adopts an A-DNA structure, there are significant conformational differences between them. In particular, the P-05′ and the C5′-C4′ bonds of the middle adenine (A5) residue exhibit a distorted trans-trans conformation in the tetragonal form, while they adopt the standard gauche-, gauche+ conformation in the hexagonal form. These differences can be correlated with certain features of the crystal packing interactions in the two forms. Furthermore, a comparison of the structures of various A-DNA octamers reveals that the A-form can be divided into two subclasses such that the hexagonal structures have helical and base pair parameters that fall closer to fiber A-DNA values, while in the tetragonal structures these parameters deviate more from fiber A-DNA. These results indicate that environment plays a major role in determining DNA conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1503353591,"Abstract Bile acids were extracted from human urine and were separated into groups of nonamidated and glycine- and taurine-conjugated compounds. Each group was subfractionated in a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography system, and the fractions were analyzed by negative ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and also by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after enzymatic removal of glycine and taurine moieties. The major glycosides of the non-amidated bile acids were more polar than reference bile acid glucosides and gave quasimolecular ions at m/z 592, 594, and 610 consistent with N-acetylglucosaminides of unsaturated dihydroxy and saturated di- and trihydroxy bile acids. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of methyl ester trimethylsilyl ether derivatives showed fragments typical for N-acetylglucosaminides (m/z 173 and 186) in addition to those also given by glucosides (m/z 204 and 217). The N-acetylglucosaminides were inert toward alpha- and beta-glucosidase but were cleaved completely with N-acetylglucosaminidase. The released sugar moiety was identified as N-acetylglucosamine. One of the liberated bile acids was identified as ursodeoxycholic acid. The other acids were not identical to any known primary or secondary bile acid in humans. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry analyses of the glycine-and taurine-conjugated bile acid glycosides only showed ions consistent with the presence of glucosides (m/z 626 and 676). These compounds were sensitive only toward beta-glucosidase which liberated a trihydroxy bile acid as the major compound. Based on the recover of 13C- and 14C-labeled chenodeoxycholic acid glucoside added as internal standard, the daily excretion of nonamidated bile acid glycosides was estimated to be about 137 micrograms or 0.29 mumol, N-acetylglucosaminides constituting about 90%. The daily excretion of the glucosides of amidated bile acids was about 150 micrograms or 0.25 mumol, glycine conjugates constituting about 90%."
https://openalex.org/W1542914817,"Abstract A gene sequence encoding the neuropeptide adipokinetic hormone (AKH) was isolated from a genomic library of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. 2.5 x 10(5) recombinant plaques were screened with a 29-mer oligonucleotide substituted with deoxyinosine at six ambiguous codon positions. One clone was obtained from which we deduced an intronless gene encoding the AKH precursor (prepro-AKH). From NH2 to COOH terminus, prepro-AKH consists of a signal peptide, a single AKH peptide block followed by a Gly-Lys-Arg processing site, and a 34-residue sequence that appears unrelated to known peptides. The cloned AKH gene sequence hybridized to one transcript from the adult corpus cardiacum/corpus allatum complex. The Manduca genome appears to contain one copy of the AKH gene. These studies are a basis for explaining synthesis of a representative from a widespread, physiologically important family of arthropod neuropeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2094876246,"Investigation of the mechanism of cleavage site selection by Xenopus RNAase P reveals that the acceptor stem, a 7 bp helix common to all tRNA precursors, is required for cleavage. We propose that Xenopus RNAase P recognizes conserved features of the mature tRNA and that the cleavage site is selected by measuring the length of the acceptor stem. In support of this, we demonstrate that insertion of 2 bp in the acceptor stem of yeast pre-tRNA(3Leu) relocates the cleavage site 2 bases 3' to the original one. In addition, insertion of 1 bp in the acceptor stem of the end-matured yeast pre-tRNA(Phe) generates an RNAase P cleavage site: the enzyme produces a mature tRNA with the characteristic 7 bp stem and releases one 5' flanking nucleotide. Since it has previously been shown that cleavage sites of the splicing endonuclease are determined by the length of the anticodon stem, RNAase P and the splicing endonuclease apparently use different stems to determine their cutting sites."
https://openalex.org/W1557240819,"A group of 23-29-kDa polypeptides in the membranes of bovine rod outer segments are substrates for S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reactions. The bulk of the methyl group incorporation is in base-labile ester-like linkages, and does not appear to be due to the widespread D-aspartyl/L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77). To determine the site(s) of methylation, 3H-methylated proteins separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate were eluted and digested with papain, leucine aminopeptidase-M, and prolidase. After performic acid oxidation of the digest, a base-labile radioactive material was recovered that coeluted with a synthetic standard of cysteic acid methyl ester upon cation exchange and G-15 gel filtration chromatography, as well as in two thin-layer electrophoresis and two thin-layer chromatography systems. These results provide direct evidence for the methylation of the alpha-carboxyl group of a carboxyl-terminal cysteinyl residue, a modification that has been proposed for the 21-kDa Ha-ras product and other cellular proteins (Clarke, S., Vogel, J. P., Deschenes, R. J., and Stock, J. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 4643-4647)."

https://openalex.org/W2082447609,"Although most examples of modulation of synaptic transmission have been obtained from excitatory rather than from inhibitory connections, serotonin (5HT) is now shown to cause a presynaptic facilitation of release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine. Brief local injections of this amine, or application of a 5HT uptake blocker, produce a long-lasting enhancement of both spontaneous and evoked inhibitory currents in the teleost Mauthner cell. Quantal analysis showed that the probability of release is increased. Focal recording indicated that 5HT acts directly on the inhibitory terminals, possibly reducing potassium conductances. Double staining with specific antibodies demonstrated a morphological substrate for this effect. Nerve endings that contain 5HT contact inhibitory terminals directly apposed to postsynaptic glycine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2043969026,"A procedure has been developed for introducing exogenous DNA into mouse eggs by injection of chromosome fragments. Chromosome fragments were dissected from human metaphase spreads and microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs. Many of the injected eggs subsequently exhibited normal pre- and postimplantation development. Embryos obtained from eggs injected with centromeric fragments retained human centromeric DNA as demonstrated by in situ hybridization analysis. From eggs injected with noncentromeric fragments, a mouse was obtained whose tail tissue exhibited the presence of human DNA. This procedure should facilitate incorporation of very large (more than 10 megabases) DNA fragments into cells and embryos without the need for cloned sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1506968148,"Abstract We have shown that antibodies against native calf thymus RNA polymerase II and antibodies against its 23-kDa subunit cross-reacted with the 23-kDa subunit of human RNA polymerase II. Immunoglobin G (IgG) against the 23-kDa subunit of calf thymus RNA polymerase II inhibited transcription in vitro from the adenovirus major late promoter. By immunoscreening of a human placenta lambda gt11 cDNA library with IgG against native CT RNA polymerase II and with IgG against its 23-kDa subunit, we isolated and characterized a full length 1.2-kilobase cDNA. We also generated oligonucleotide probes from a sequence of amino acid residues obtained by a modified peptide microsequencing procedure. The cDNAs isolated both from oligoscreening and immunoscreening were identical. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence analysis indicates a polypeptide of 197 amino acid (23 kDa). The in vitro translation product of human cDNA HP-23 was precipitated by IgG against the 23-kDa subunit of CT RNA polymerase II. The amino acid sequence deduced from HP-23 showed no obvious homology with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase subunits or with any of its sigma factors."
https://openalex.org/W1538742197,"The activity of protein kinase C is dependent on communication between a catalytic domain and a Ca2+- and lipid-binding regulatory domain in the kinase molecule. It is shown here that acidic reaction conditions can bypass the calcium and lipid requirement in the autophosphorylation of protein kinase C. Acidic pH does not entirely deregulate the kinase, though, since only autophosphorylation is favored between pH 4 and 6 and not the phosphorylation of alternative substrate proteins. Interestingly, low pH stably activated protein kinase C: when restored to neutral pH, the autophosphorylation reaction remained independent of Ca2+ and lipid. These observations suggest that protonation of functional groups in the protein kinase C molecule, with their pKa suggestive of histidine imidazole, can produce a stable conformation where regulatory constraints on enzyme activity have been removed."
https://openalex.org/W1566142539,"Abstract The mechanism(s) whereby the indirect dopamine agonist methamphetamine causes a 2-3-fold increase in rat striatal preprotachykinin (PPT) mRNA was investigated. It was determined that the increase in PPT mRNA levels following a single injection of 5 mg of methamphetamine/kg of body weight was initiated in the cell nucleus, ruling out cytoplasmic PPT mRNA stabilization as a primary mechanism for this increase. It was established with T1 nuclease/RNA protection protocols that methamphetamine injection increased mature PPT message approximately 3-fold over a 2-h period, and this increase was sustained for at least 4 h after drug treatment. Striatal content of the PPT gene primary transcript (containing transcribed introns) was decreased by 50% within 20 min and remained suppressed for at least 4 h post-methamphetamine. Nuclear transcription assays indicated a 2-3-fold increase in the rate of gene transcription that lasted 60-90 min after methamphetamine treatment; by 2 h the transcription rate had returned to control levels. Taken together, these changes and their time courses suggest the indirect dopamine agonist alters striatal PPT gene expression at two levels: 1) a transient increase in the rate of PPT gene transcription and 2) a more sustained increase in the rate at which PPT hnRNA is processed to mature PPT mRNA. It is unclear whether these two changes are linked or are independent modes of action by methamphetamine."
https://openalex.org/W1590264526,"In the course of characterizing polyclonal antibodies to β nerve growth factor (NGF) on immunoblot replicas of sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, we observed a protein (designated C protein) migrating as two bands (14.0 and 13.5 kDa) that copurifies with NGF and reacts strongly with its antibodies. The molecule is detectable in the 7 S, β, and 2.5 S forms of NGF, accounting in the latter two for approximately 2% of total protein. The C protein can be separated from the A and B chains of β-NGF on acetic acid-urea gels and on two-dimensional gels but not by isoelectric focusing alone. The molecule has been isolated to near purity on reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid analyses and sequencing through 49 Edman cycles revealed that the protein preparation is composed of the intact and desoctapeptide (des-(1–8)) polypeptide chains and suggested a glycosylation site at Asn-45. Following digestion with N-glycanase, the chains migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels identically with the A and B chains of β-NGF. Although this was accompanied by some degree of proteolytic degradation, the presence of glucosamine (∼4 mol/mol of single chain) was confirmed in acid hydrolysates on the amino acid analyzer. No amino sugars were detected in hydrolysates of the A chain nor was galactosamine recovered in either preparation. Glycosylated NGF promotes neuronal growth and survival in a manner indistinguishable from native 2.5 S NGF when tested in the chick sensory ganglion assay and with rat postnatal sympathetic neurons in a dissociated culture cell survival assay or in a compartmentalized culture growth assay. These studies reveal that NGF can be modified by glycosylation in a manner that does not reduce its biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1561298857,"Abstract The relationship between the cholesteryl ester content of normal human very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and its ability to bind to apolipoprotein E (apoE), heparin, and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor have been compared. Plasma VLDL were separated by heparin affinity chromatography into two fractions: one with apoE and one without. Both fractions had the same cholesteryl ester content relative to apolipoprotein B (apoB). LDL, on the other hand, had a greater cholesteryl ester content. VLDL were modified by lipolysis to express the ability to bind apoE (Ishikawa, Y., Fielding, C. J., and Fielding, P. E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2744-2749). Lipolyzed VLDL with or without apoE were compared for their ability to bind to heparin or the up-regulated fibroblast LDL receptor. Lipolyzed VLDL bound with the same affinity to the receptor whether or not the particles contained apoE. ApoB, not apoE, appears then to be the important ligand for normal VLDL. On the other hand, modified VLDL without apoE, even though binding to the LDL receptor, did not bind to heparin. These data suggest that apoE mediates heparin binding in normal VLDL, that apoB mediates receptor binding, and that the cholesteryl ester content of VLDL is not a factor in the induction of the ability to bind apoE."
https://openalex.org/W1565575857,"Abstract A kinetic pulse-chase labeling technique was used to measure the intracellular half-life of the glucocorticoid receptor in S49 mouse lymphoma cells. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and then cultured in the presence of unlabeled methionine (chase). Labeled receptors were quantitated at periodic time points during the chase by immunoadsorption to protein A-Sepharose using the BuGR2 monoclonal antireceptor antibody. The decay of labeled receptors during the chase was linear on a semilog plot, consistent with first order kinetics. Receptor half-life was 9 h when cells were cultured in either phenol red-containing medium supplemented with fetal calf serum or in phenol red free-medium supplemented with charcoal extracted serum, indicating that endogenous steroids do not affect receptor half-life. Receptor half-life was also unchanged when cells were cultured in the presence of 0.1 microM dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid hormone, or 0.1 microM RU486 (11 beta-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)-17 beta-hydroxy-17 alpha-(propynylestra-4,9- diene-3-one), an antiglucocorticoid hormone. We conclude that the intracellular half-life of the glucocorticoid receptor in S49 mouse lymphoma cells is not regulated by either glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1605765785,"Abstract We have isolated a 3922-base pair (bp) cDNA clone for rat nonerythroid alpha-spectrin from a rat kidney lambda gt11 cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that this cDNA contains an open reading frame of 3090 bp encoding for the C-terminal 1030 amino acid sequence of rat kidney alpha-spectrin. The 3'-untranslated region (including a 38-bp poly(A+) tail) contains an 832-bp sequence. A single mRNA of about 8 kilobase pairs was detected in rat liver, kidney, brain, heart, intestine, lung, testis, stomach, spleen, and muscle with varying abundances, which is consistent with and further confirms the presence of spectrins in nonerythroid tissues as demonstrated previously by immunoblot analysis. Southern blot analysis suggested that there is a single gene for nonerythroid alpha-spectrin. The derived amino acid sequence contains sequence from the spectrin 106-residue internal repeat 12 to the C terminus of rat kidney alpha-spectrin. Sequence comparison with human and chicken nonerythroid alpha-spectrin showed that nonerythroid alpha-spectrin is well conserved during evolution. The rat kidney alpha-spectrin sequence, when compared to rat brain alpha-spectrin, contains an extra 76-amino-acid sequence at the C terminus. Sequence comparison of all the internal repeats available revealed that the internal repeat 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 has highest sequence similarity with internal repeat 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, respectively. Therefore, internal repeats 3-8 and 12-17 are most likely derived from an ancestral gene through gene duplication, suggesting that the spectrin gene is derived from a half-spectrin gene by gene duplication and divergence during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1954734717,"To observe surface topography of microtubules, we have applied scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which can image metal and semiconductive surfaces with atomic resolution. Isolated microtubules fixed in 0.1% glutaraldehyde in reassembly buffer containing 0.8 M glycerol were imaged in air on a graphite substrate. The presence of microtubules in solution was verified by electron microscopy. At atmospheric pressure and room temperature, STM probing of both freeze-dried and hydrated microtubules reveals structures approximately 25 nm in width, consisting of longitudinal filaments about 4 nm in width. These structures match electron microscopy images of microtubules and their component protofilaments. Microtubules imaged by STM frequently appear buckled and semiflattened. Top-view shaded scans show what appear to be individual tubulin subunits within protofilaments. We believe these results represent the first direct STM observation of protein assemblies in which components can be identified. Although the microtubule image resolution described here is no better than that presently obtainable by other techniques (e.g., electron microscopy with freeze-drying, shadowing, and/or negative staining), it is significant that suitably prepared biomolecules may be sufficiently conductive and stable for STM imaging, which is ultimately capable of atomic resolution. Further development of STM technology, computer-enhanced image processing, and elucidation of optimal STM sample preparation indicate that STM and related applications will offer unique opportunities for the study of biomolecular surfaces.—Simić-Krstić, Y.; Kelly, M.; Schneiker, C.; Krasovich, M.; McCuskey, R.; Koruga, D.; Hameroff, S.

https://openalex.org/W1585730045,"An intact gene coding for wild type diphtheria toxin was reconstituted in vitro from fragments of cloned inactive diphtheria toxin mutants with defects in different parts of the gene. The reconstituted DNA template was amplified using the Taq DNA polymerase chain reaction, providing a virtually unlimited supply. The toxin was expressed in vitro by transcription from a T3 RNA polymerase promoter, followed by translation of the mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Diphtheria toxin synthesised in this manner was shown to be as toxic as natural toxin and behaved like natural toxin in every way tested. This can serve as a general approach for study of toxic proteins, opening up the possibility of in vitro gene manipulation. Reconstitution of the wild type gene from fragments followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification bypasses the hazards of cloning protein toxins."
https://openalex.org/W1548527080,"We have investigated the developmental regulation of the avian fast skeletal muscle troponin T (TnTf) gene of the Japanese quail. Sequence analysis of troponin T mRNA, cDNA clones, and a genomic DNA segment demonstrate that the avian, fast skeletal TnTf protein isoforms are produced from a single gene. This TnTf gene is expressed in skeletal muscle, but not in adult cardiac muscles or in non-muscle tissues. In addition to known TnT isoforms, three new isoforms of TnT are described. These isoforms arise by regulated alternative RNA splicing of exons in the 5' and 3' regions of TnTf transcripts. Alternative splicing of the 5' TnTf exons involves splicing of multiple exons in different combinations (i.e. not mutually exclusive), whereas 3' alternative splicing involves mutually exclusive splice choices between two exons (alpha or beta exons). S1 nuclease protection and primer extension analyses show that alternative splicing of both 5' and 3' exons is precisely regulated and coordinated in physiologically different striated muscles, which express distinct, restricted combinations of 5' and 3' alternatively spliced exons in mRNA transcripts. In contrast, different embryonic muscles and clonal embryonic myoblast cultures coexpress the 3' alternative splice choices. This indicates that alternative splicing of TnTf mRNAs is controlled in different adult muscles by specific trans factors, and not by the restricted expression of different spliced forms in different embryonic myoblast lineages. Comparison of TnTf isoform expression in quail and chicken flight muscle (Wilkinson, J. M., Moir, A. J., and Waterfield, M. D. (1984) Eur. J. Biochem. 143, 47-56) to TnTf isoforms of the rat (Breitbart, R. E., and Nadal-Ginard, B. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 188, 313-324), and rabbit (Pearlstone, J. R., Carpenter, M. R., and Smillie, M. B. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 73, 1902-1906) indicates that the avian gene contains an additional exon(s) not present in mammalian genes. The alternative exon sequences TnTf mRNAs expressed in anatomically distinct quail muscles can be correlated with sequences in TnTf protein isoforms in these chicken muscles. Thus, the regulated splicing of alternative exons in TnT transcripts, and not selective translation of stochastically spliced TnT mRNAs, regulates TnTf isoform expression in specific muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1549020945,"We have developed an affinity technique to obtain active gene domains from murine erythroleukemia cell nuclei, based on the differential sensitivity of potentially active and inactive chromatin to DNase I. Nuclei isolated from potentially active noninduced cells and transcriptionally active induced MEL cells were treated with DNase I at concentrations which did not digest the beta-globin gene, followed by repair using a typical nick translation reaction during which a cleavable biotinylated nucleotide analog, 5-[N-biotinamido)hexanoamido-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionyl -3-aminoallyl]-2'- deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (Bio-19-SS-dUTP), was inserted into DNA sequences. Following purification and digestion with EcoRI restriction endonuclease, biotinylated sequences were affinity isolated by sequential binding to streptavidin and biotincellulose. The streptavidin/biotin-cellulose complex bound up to 80% of the nick-translated DNA, which comprised a small percentage of the total nuclear DNA. Cleavage of the disulfide bond in the linker arm of the biotinylated nucleotide resulted in elution of virtually all of the affinity isolated sequences. Hybridization analysis of this fraction of DNA revealed up to a 16-fold enrichment for the active beta-globin gene, as compared with DNA which did not bind to the biotincellulose. Conversely, the inactive alpha-fetoprotein gene was barely detectable in affinity isolated DNA from noninduced cells and was 2-fold depleted in samples from induced cells."
