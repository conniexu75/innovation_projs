https://openalex.org/W2068769173,"Recent experiments on the chlorite-iodide-malonic acid-starch reaction in a gel reactor give the first evidence of the existence of the symmetry breaking, reaction-diffusion structures predicted by Turing in 1952. A five-variable model that describes the temporal behavior of the system is reduced to a two-variable model, and its spatial behavior is analyzed. Structures have been found with wavelengths that are in good agreement with those observed experimentally. The gel plays a key role by binding key iodine species, thereby creating the necessary difference in the effective diffusion coefficients of the activator and inhibitor species, iodide and chlorite ions, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2012019181,"Recent Goldstone-Haystack radio interferometric observations of the quasars 3C 279 and 3C 273 reveal rapid variations in their fine structure. Most notably, the data for 3C 279, interpreted in terms of a symmetric double-source model and the accepted red-shift distance, indicate differential proper motion corresponding to an apparent speed about ten times that of light. A number of possible mechanisms that might give rise to such an apparent speed are considered; although several may be plausible, no definitive choice can be made on the basis of present evidence. More interferometric observations of quasars are clearly needed to clarify their structure and internal kinematics."

Even though there are atmospheric scatterers in addition to the molecular scatterers, it is possible to relate the intensity of the scattered radiation with the atmospheric pressure. The variation of pressure over the planet reveals the topography to vary over 7 kilometers in height and to be correlated with visible features. The carbon dioxide polar cap, in addition to being a cold trap for volatile gases in the atmosphere, may alsobe a very efficient adsorption trap for nonvolatiles. This last property may make the cap a repository for gases produced by geological or biological activity (15)."

Reexamination of site maps of the ancient Maya city of Tikal, Guatemala, has revealed an important, overlooked factor in Maya centralization and urban settlement organization. In a geographical zone affected by an extended dry season and away from permanent water sources, large, well-planned reservoirs provided resource control as well as political leverage."
https://openalex.org/W1990722868,"Analytical transmission electron microscopy, electron microprobe analyses, and singlecrystal x-ray diffraction data support the conclusion that high potassium contents, up to 1.5 weight percent K(2)O, of some diopside and omphacite inclusions from diamonds represent valid clinopyroxene compositions with K in solid solution. This conclusion contradicts the traditional view of pyroxene crystal chemistry, which holds that K is too large to be incorporated in the pyroxene structure. These diopside and omphacite inclusions have a high degree of crystal perfection and anomalously large unit-cell volumes, and a defect-free structure is observed in K-bearing regions when imaged by transmission electron microscopy. These observations imply that clinopyroxene can be a significant host for K in the mantle and that some clinopyroxene inclusions and their diamond hosts may have grown in a highly K-enriched environment."
https://openalex.org/W2041039248,"Submicrometer disordered metallic systems at low temperatures display interesting conductance fluctuation effects, owing to the interference of coherent electron wave transmission through the system. This quantum interference phenomenon also gives rise to the striking experimental observation that the 1/f noise power (where f is frequency) in disordered conductors increases as the temperature is decreased, contrary to common intuition. The theoretical techniques developed for this problem can be applied to the transmission of light through a random medium, and this yields novel predictions for the correlations in the laser speckle patterns and the possibility of studying the positions and motions of scatterers in a medium which multiply scatter the probing light."
https://openalex.org/W2056712495,"The spacial distribution of seismically induced liquefaction features discovered along the Atlantic seaboard suggests that during the last 2000 to 5000 years, large earthquakes (body wave magnitude, mb ≥ 5.8 ± 0.4) in this region may have been restricted exclusively to South Carolina. Paleoliquefaction evidence for six large prehistoric earthquakes was discovered there. At least five of these past events originated in the Charleston, South Carolina, area, the locale of a magnitude 7+ event in 1886. During the past two millennia, large events may have occurred about every 500 to 600 years."
