https://openalex.org/W2095217951,"Although cocaine binds to several sites in the brain, the biochemical receptor mechanism or mechanisms associated with its dependence producing properties are unknown. It is shown here that the potencies of cocaine-like drugs in self-administration studies correlate with their potencies in inhibiting [3H]mazindol binding to the dopamine transporters in the rat striatum, but not with their potencies in binding to a large number of other presynaptic and postsynaptic binding sites. Thus, the cocaine receptor related to substance abuse is proposed to be the one associated with dopamine uptake inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2144515939,"In vivo protein-DNA interactions at the developmentally regulated enhancer of the mouse muscle creatine kinase (MCK) gene were examined by a newly developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) footprinting procedure. This ligation mediated, single-sided PCR technique permits the exponential amplification of an entire sequence ladder. Several footprints were detected in terminally differentiated muscle cells where the MCK gene is actively transcribed. None were observed in myogenic cells prior to differentiation or in nonmuscle cells. Two footprints appear to correspond to sites that can bind the myogenic regulator MyoD1 in vitro, whereas two others represent muscle specific use of apparently general factors. Because MyoD1 is synthesized by undifferentiated myoblasts, these data imply that additional regulatory mechanisms must restrict the interaction between this protein and its target site prior to differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2029299113,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most common form of dysmorphic genetic obesity associated with mental retardation. About 60% of cases have a cytological deletion of chromosome 15q11q13 (refs 2, 3). These deletions occur de novo exclusively on the paternal chromosome. By contrast, Angelman syndrome (AS) is a very different clinical disorder and is also associated with deletions of region 15q11q13 (refs 6-8), indistinguishable from those in PWS except that they occur de novo on the maternal chromosome. The parental origin of the affected chromosomes 15 in these disorders could, therefore, be a contributory factor in determining their clinical phenotypes. We have now used cloned DNA markers specific for the 15q11q13 subregion to determine the parental origin of chromosome 15 in PWS individuals not having cytogenetic deletions; these individuals account for almost all of the remaining 40% of PWS cases. Probands in two families displayed maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15q11q13. This is the first demonstration that maternal heterodisomy--the presence of two different chromosome 15s derived from the mother--can be associated with a human genetic disease. The absence of a paternal contribution of genes in region 15q11q13, as found in PWS deletion cases, rather than a mutation in a specific gene(s) in this region may result in expression of the clinical phenotype. Thus, we conclude that a gene or genes in region 15q11q13 must be inherited from each parent for normal human development."
https://openalex.org/W1595593492,"Fluorescent indicators sensitive to cytosolic concentrations of free Na+ have been synthesized and characterized. They consist of a crown ether, 1,7-diaza-4,10,13-trioxacyclopentadecane, linked via its nitrogens to fluorophores bearing additional liganding centers. In the currently preferred dye, SBFI (short for sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate), the fluorophores are benzofurans linked to isophthalate groups. Selectivities for Na+ over K+ of about 20 are observed, resulting in effective dissociation constants for Na+ of about 20 mM against a background of 120 mM K+. Increasing [Na+] increases the ratio of excitation efficiency at 330-345 nm to that at 370-390 nm with emission collected at 450-550 nm, so that ratio fluorometry and imaging can be performed with the same wavelengths as used with the well known Ca2+ indicator fura-2. If the macrocyclic ring is increased in size to a 1,10-diaza-4,7,13,16-tetraoxacyclooctadecane, the chelators become selective for K+ over Na+."

https://openalex.org/W1963550266,"An important control point in gene expression is at the level of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability. The mRNAs of certain regulatory cellular proteins such as oncogenes, cytokines, lymphokines, and transcriptional activators are extremely labile. These messages share a common AUUUA pentamer in their 3' untranslated region, which confers cytoplasmic instability. A cytosolic protein was identified that binds specifically to RNA molecules containing four reiterations of the AUUUA structural element. This protein consists of three subunits and binds rapidly to AUUUA-containing RNA. Such protein-RNA complexes are resistant to the actions of denaturing and reducing agents, demonstrating very stable binding. The time course, stability, and specificity of the protein-AUUUA interaction suggests the possibility that the formation of this complex may target susceptible mRNA for rapid cytoplasmic degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2015232786,"Genomic sequencing permits studies of in vivo DNA methylation and protein-DNA interactions, but its use has been limited because of the complexity of the mammalian genome. A newly developed genomic sequencing procedure in which a ligation mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used generates high quality, reproducible sequence ladders starting with only 1 microgram of uncloned mammalian DNA per reaction. Different sequence ladders can be created simultaneously by inclusion of multiple primers and visualized separately by rehybridization. Relatively little radioactivity is needed for hybridization and exposure times are short. Methylation patterns in genomic DNA are readily detectable; for example, 17 CpG dinucleotides in the 5' region of human X-linked PGK-1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1) were found to be methylated on an inactive human X chromosome, but unmethylated on an active X chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2020954035,"The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, the product of t(9:22), is the cytogenetic hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The c-abl oncogene on chromosome 9 is translocated to the Ph chromosome and linked to a breakpoint cluster region (bcr), which is part of a large bcr gene. This results in the formation of a bcr-c-abl fusion gene, which is transcribed into an 8.5 kb chimeric mRNA encoding a 210 kd bcr-c-abl fusion protein. The Ph chromosome is also found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Although the c-abl is translocated and a new 190 kd c-abl protein has been identified, no breakpoints are observed in the bcr (Ph+bcr- ALL). Here we show that in Ph+bcr- ALL, breakpoints in chromosome 22 occur within the same bcr gene, but more 5' of the bcr. Cloning of a chimeric bcr-c-abl cDNA demonstrates that the fusion gene is transcribed into a 7 kb mRNA, encoding a novel fusion protein."

https://openalex.org/W1976862382,"The aspartate receptor of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is a cell surface sensory transducer that binds extracellular aspartate and sends a transmembrane signal to the inside of the bacterium. The flexibility and allostery of this receptor was examined by placing sulfhydryl groups as potential cross-linking sites at targeted locations in the protein. Seven different mutant receptors were constructed, each containing a single cysteine residue at a different position in the primary structure. Intramolecular disulfide bond formation within oligomers of these mutant receptors is shown to trap structural fluctuations and to detect ligand-induced changes in structure. The results indicate that the receptor oligomer has a flexible, dynamic structure which undergoes a global change upon aspartate binding."

https://openalex.org/W1550813715,"Expression vectors were constructed that code for mutated forms of the regulatory type 1 subunit (RI) of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. These mutations alter a specific amino acid which is present in each of two homologous cAMP-binding domains of the RI protein. When these expression vectors were introduced into NIH 3T3 and Y1 adrenocortical tumor cells a mutant RI protein was produced that acted in a dominant fashion to cause a 20-400-fold inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation. In addition, processes controlled by cAMP in adrenal cells were blocked; cells became resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of cAMP and defective in steroid synthesis. Expression of mutant RI genes in cells provides a specific means to explore the role of cAMP and protein phosphorylation in the process of intracellular signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2071069136,"The surface forces apparatus technique was used for measuring the adhesion, deformation, and fusion of bilayers supported on mica surfaces in aqueous solutions. The most important force leading to the direct fusion of bilayers is the hydrophobic interaction, although the occurrence of fusion is not simply related to the force law between bilayers. Bilayers do not need to ""overcome"" some repulsive force barrier, such as hydration, before they can fuse. Instead, once bilayer surfaces come within about 1 nanometer of each other, local deformations and molecular rearrangements allow them to ""bypass"" these forces."
https://openalex.org/W1980051803,"According to the place principles of the classical hearing theory, the physical entity frequency is encoded in the auditory periphery as place information (tonotopic representation), which is decoded in more central parts of the auditory system to form the subjective entity pitch. However, this relation is true only for pure-tone signals (spectral pitch); it can be quite different in the case of complex auditory stimuli (virtual pitch), thus requiring a multistage process for pitch formation. Neuromagnetic measurements showed that the tonotopic organization of the primary auditory cortex reflects the pitch rather than the frequency of the stimulus; that is, the pitch formation process must take place in subcortical regions."
https://openalex.org/W1972450532,"Rejection of bone marrow grafts in irradiated mice is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells and is controlled by genes linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). It has, however, not been possible to identify the genes or their products. An MHC class I (Dd) transgene introduced in C57BL donors prevented the rejection of their bone marrow by NK cells in irradiated allogeneic and F1 hybrid mice expressing the Dd gene. Conversely, H-2Dd transgenic C57BL recipients acquired the ability to reject bone marrow from C57BL donors but not from H-2Dd transgenic C57BL donors. These results provide formal evidence that NK cells are part of a system capable of rejecting cells because they lack normal genes of the host type, in contrast to T cells, which recognize cells that contain abnormal or novel sequences of non-host type."
https://openalex.org/W2060668364,"Although meiotic gene conversion has long been known to be accompanied by crossing-over, a direct test of the converse has not been possible. An experiment was designed to determine whether crossing-over is accompanied by gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nine restriction site heterologies were introduced into a 9-kilobase chromosomal interval that exhibits 22 percent crossing-over. Of all the exchange events that occurred, at least 59 percent of meiotic crossovers are accompanied by gene conversion of one or more of the restriction site heterologies. The average gene conversion tract length was 1.5 kilobases. An unexpected result was that the introduction of as few as seven heterozygosities significantly altered the outcome of recombination events, reducing the frequency of crossovers by 50 percent and increasing the number of exceptional tetrads. This alteration results from a second recombination event induced by repair of heteroduplex DNA containing multiple mismatched base pairs."
https://openalex.org/W2136868816,"We have isolated cDNA clones that code for a proteoglycan-related polypeptide with unique properties. A lambda gt11 expression library made from human fibroblast mRNA was screened with an antiserum made against a proteoglycan fraction from human fetal membranes. One group of positive clones revealed an open reading frame coding for 685 amino acids from the COOH terminus of a polypeptide. This amino acid sequence contains a domain that is strongly homologous with the COOH-terminal core protein domain of the large aggregating cartilage proteoglycan. This domain also contains sequences that are homologous with vertebrate lectins that bind terminal galactosyl, N-acetyl-glucosaminyl or mannosyl residues. On the NH2-terminal side of the lectin-like domain the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence contains two epidermal growth factor-related segments. The cDNA clones were shown to belong to a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan by using antisera made against two peptides predicted from the cDNA sequence. These antisera were reactive with a proteoglycan fraction from fibroblasts after chondroitinase treatment of the fraction but not after treatment with heparinase or no treatment. Among the several polypeptides reactive with the anti-peptide antibodies the largest one, corresponding to a molecular weight of about 400,000, is likely to be the intact core protein, whereas the smaller polypeptides may be processing products or products of artifactual proteolysis. These results show that the amino acid sequence belongs to a proteoglycan core protein, and the sequence, therefore, provides a molecular definition to this proteoglycan. The lectin-related and growth factor-like sequences in the core protein of this proteoglycan suggest that it may play a role in intercellular signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1565854032,"Cultured cells have on their cell surface a specific high-affinity binding site (receptor) for high density lipoproteins (HDL) which appears to promote cholesterol efflux. In this study we characterized the cellular mechanisms involved in HDL receptor-mediated transport of cholesterol from cultured human fibroblasts and bovine aortic endothelial cells. HDL3, chemically modified by tetranitromethane (TNM-HDL3), is not recognized by this receptor and was used as a control for efflux not mediated by HDL receptor binding. HDL3 and TNM-HDL3 were found to be equally effective in causing efflux of plasma membrane cholesterol radiolabeled with [3H]cholesterol. However, HDL3 was much more effective than TNM-HDL3 in causing efflux of [3H]cholesterol associated with intracellular membranes. By measuring movement of endogenously synthesized [3H]cholesterol to the plasma membrane, and into the medium, we found that HDL3 induced a rapid movement of [3H]cholesterol from a preplasma membrane compartment to the plasma membrane that preceded [3H]cholesterol efflux. This effect was not observed with TNM-HDL3. Thus, receptor binding of HDL3 appears to facilitate removal of cellular cholesterol from specific intracellular pools by initiation of translocation of intracellular cholesterol to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2036574703,"The genetic transfer system in the extremely halophilic archaebacterium Halobacterium volcanii is the only archaebacterial mating system known. The mechanism of genetic transfer of this archaebacterium was studied by using the immobile plasmids pHV2 and pHV11 as cytoplasmic markers. It was found that the cytoplasms of the parental types do not mix during the mating process, that each parental type can serve both as a donor and as a recipient, and that cytoplasmic bridges, with dimensions of up to 2 micrometers long and 0.1 micrometer in diameter, were formed between the parental types. These bridges appear to be used for the transfer of DNA from one cell to another. If so, this archaebacterial mating system is different from both eubacterial conjugation and eukaryotic sexual cell fusion."

https://openalex.org/W1981492068,"A phosphonate monoester, mcarboxyphenyl phenylacetamidomethylphosphonate, has been found to be a specific inhibitor of the class C β-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99. Inactivation is rapid (103 per second per molar concentration) and reactivation very slow (2.2 × 10-6 per second). Apparently concerted with the inactivation, one equivalent (with respect to the enzyme) of mhydroxybenzoate is released. Reactivation is accelerated by hydroxylamine and benzohydroxamate. This suggests that the loss of enzyme activity is due to phosphonylation of an active site functional group. This discovery holds the promise of a new general class of β-lactamase inhibitors and, perhaps, antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W1578731554,"Escherichia coli can use the nonreducing disaccharide trehalose as a sole source of carbon and energy. Trehalose transport into the cell is mediated via the phosphotransferase system, and a mutant depleted in the nonspecific proteins enzyme I, HPr, and enzyme IIIGlc of this system was not only unable to grow on glucose or mannitol but also was strongly reduced in its ability to grow on trehalose. A pseudorevertant (PPA69) of such a deletion mutant was isolated that could again grow on glucose but not on mannitol. This revertant could now also use trehalose as a carbon source due to a constitutive galactose permease. PPA69 was subjected to Tn10 insertional mutagenesis, and a mutant (UE5) was isolated that no longer could use trehalose as a carbon source but could still grow on glucose. UE5 lacked a periplasmic trehalase that was present in PPA69. P1-mediated transduction of this Tn10 insertion (treA::Tn10) into a pts+ wild-type strain (MC4100) had no effect on the ability of MC4100 to grow on trehalose but resulted in loss of the periplasmic trehalase activity. The Tn10 insertion was mapped at 26 min on the E. coli linkage map and was 3% cotransducible with trp, in the order treA::Tn10, trp, cys. Trehalase activity in MC4100 was not induced by growth in the presence of trehalose but increased by about 10-fold when 0.6 M sucrose was added to minimal growth medium. Using the in vivo mini-Mu cloning system and growth on trehalose as selection, we cloned the treA gene. A 9-kilobase EcoRI fragment containing treA was subcloned into pBR322. Strains carrying this plasmid (pTRE5) contained about 100-fold higher periplasmic trehalase activity than PPA69 or MC4100. Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we found a protein of molecular weight 58,000 among the periplasmic proteins of the pTRE5-carrying strain that was absent in UE5. This protein was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography and contained all the trehalase activity. Minicells containing the treA+ plasmid produced, in addition to three other proteins, the 58,000-dalton protein. Thus, the plasmid carries the structural gene for the periplasmic trehalase and not just a gene involved in the regulation of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1974860298,"The tryptophan gene (trp) repressor of Escherichia coli has been converted into a site-specific nuclease by covalently attaching it to the 1,10-phenanthroline-copper complex. In its cuprous form, the coordination complex with hydrogen peroxide as a coreactant cleaves DNA by oxidatively attacking the deoxyribose moiety. The chemistry for the attachment of 1,10-phenanthroline to the trp repressor involves modification of lysyl residues with iminothiolane followed by alkylation of the resulting sulfhydryl groups with 5-iodoacetamido-1,10-phenanthroline. The modified trp repressor cleaves the operators of aroH and trpEDCBA upon the addition of cupric ion and thiol in a reaction dependent on the corepressor L-tryptophan. Scission was restricted to the binding site for the repressor, defined by deoxyribonuclease I footprinting. Since DNA-binding proteins have recognition sequences approximately 20 base pairs long, the nucleolytic activities derived from them could be used to isolate long DNA fragments for sequencing or chromosomal mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2016600277,"The slender elongated form that is characteristic of the forelimb long bones of gibbons (Hylobates) has long been attributed to their functional adaptation to habitual armswinging locomotion, although potential selective advantages of this morphology for brachiation have yet to be demonstrated. If the forces exerted on the limb skeleton during brachiation indeed differ greatly from those of other locomotor modes, then the changes in skeletal loading accompanying a shift in locomotor behaviour could favour alterations in skeletal morphology in brachiating lineages. In vivo skeletal strain patterns recorded by using radiotelemetry during brachiation indicate that the forelimb bones of the gibbon are loaded in substantial tension and show reduced bending and compression in comparison with those of other mammals. We suggest that this unique loading regime could have contributed to the evolution of the distinctive morphology of hylobatid limbs."
https://openalex.org/W2014625760,"Activation of protein kinase C is thought to require association of the kinase with the cell membrane. It has been assumed that cellular substrates for the kinase must likewise be associated with membranes, and previous studies with membrane-associated myristoylated proteins have supported this view. It is now shown that a mutation that prevents the normal amino-terminal myristoylation of a prominent cellular substrate of protein kinase C, and appears to prevent its membrane association, does not prevent the normal phosphorylation of this protein in intact cells in response to phorbol esters. Thus, membrane association may not be required in order for protein kinase C substrates to undergo phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1521449766,"[D-Ala2,Leu5,Cys6]Enkephalin (DALCE) is a synthetic enkephalin analog which contains a sulfhydryl group. DALCE binds with high affinity to delta-receptors, with moderate affinity to mu-receptors, and with negligible affinity to kappa-receptors. Pretreatment of rat brain membranes with DALCE resulted in concentration-dependent loss of delta-binding sites. Using 2 nM [3H][D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (where Pen represents penicillamine) to label delta-sites, 50% loss of sites occurred at about 3 microM DALCE. Loss of sites was not reversed by subsequent incubation in buffer containing 250 mM NaCl and 100 microM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), conditions which cause dissociation of opiate agonists. By contrast, the enkephalin analogs [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin, [D-Ser2,Leu5,Thr6]enkephalin, [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin, and [D-Ala2,D-Leu5,Lys6]enkephalin were readily dissociated by NaCl and Gpp(NH)p, producing negligible loss at 3 microM. This suggests that DALCE binds covalently to the receptors. Pretreatment of membranes with the reducing agents dithiothreitol and beta-mercaptoethanol had no effect on opiate binding. Thus, loss of sites required both specific recognition by opiate receptors and a thiol group. The irreversible effect of DALCE was completely selective for delta-receptors. Pretreatment with DALCE had no effect on binding of ligands to mu- or kappa-receptors. The effect of DALCE on delta-binding was: 1) markedly attenuated by inclusion of dithiothreitol in the preincubation buffer, 2) partially reversed by subsequent incubation with dithiothreitol, 3) slightly enhanced when converted to the disulfide-linked dimer, and 4) prevented by blocking the DALCE sulfhydryl group with N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide. These results indicate that DALCE binds covalently to delta-receptors by forming a disulfide bond with a sulfhydryl group in the binding site. The mechanism may involve a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1558162435,"The generation of oxygen reduction products by Neisseria gonorrhoeae FA1090 upon exposure to streptonigrin (SNG) and paraquat (PQ2+) and their toxicity was examined. N. gonorrhoeae exhibited maximal cyanide-insensitive respiration, which was employed as an indicator of superoxide (O2-) formation, in the presence of 0.064 mM streptonigrin and 90 mM PQ2+, respectively. Using the concentrations of SNG and PQ2+ described above, complete lethality (greater than 10(8) cells/ml) was observed among cells exposed to SNG, whereas PQ2+ reduced viability by only 3 logs. In an attempt to determine the oxygen radical species generated by gonococci when exposed to SNG, dimethyl sulfoxide, Fe3+, KCN, and the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), we were able to detect .OH manifested as the methyl adduct (DMPO-CH3). The production of the latter species was not inhibited by catalase, suggesting intracellular .OH generation. When PQ2+ was substituted for SNG, only low levels of DMPO-CH3 were observed, the production of which ceased within 8 min. SNG and PQ2+, added to a O2(-)- generating system in the presence of Fe3+, promoted increased .OH generation. The iron chelator diethyl-enetriaminepentaacetic acid enhanced the generation of spin-trapped .OH and O2- in the presence of PQ2+. The addition of catalase to this system, however, eliminated the DMPO-CH3 signal, showing that the .OH in this system was extracellular. PQ2+-mediated generation of extracellular .OH in the presence of Fe3+-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid EDTA did not enhance the killing of gonococci by PQ2+. These data show that the lethality of SNG relative to PQ2+ is due to the inherent ability of SNG to catalyze the formation of critical levels of intracellular .OH, detectable through the use of spin trapping techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2015148320,Many Gram-negative bacteria export proteins to the exterior. Some of these proteins are first secreted into the periplasm and then cross the outer membrane in a separate step. The source of energy required for the translocation is unknown. Export of the extracellular protein proaerolysin from the periplasm through the outer membrane of Aeromonas salmonicida is inhibited by a proton ionophore and by low extracellular pH. One possible explanation of these results is that a proton gradient across the outer membrane is required for export.
https://openalex.org/W1483673785,"The level of nonesterified cholesterol within MA-10 Leydig Tumor cells is regulated acutely by trophic hormones (Freeman, D. A., and Ascoli, M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14231-14238). In the present studies, we localize the site of this steroidogenic cholesterol to the plasma membrane and characterize the means by which this membrane becomes cholesterol-depleted. It is possible to detect the translocation of both newly synthesized cholesterol and cholesterol derived from lipoproteins from the cell interior to the plasma membrane. Stimulated MA-10 cells that are actively producing steroid hormones divert cholesterol from the normal intracellular or plasma membrane acceptor sites into the steroid biosynthetic pathway. Another important effect of steroidogenic stimulation is to cause internalization of plasma membrane cholesterol. Changes in cholesterol traffic in stimulated cells can be blocked by preventing the utilization of cholesterol for steroidogenesis. This later finding indicates that the changes in cholesterol transport induced by trophic hormones are consequences rather than primary causes of steroidogenic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1867603625,"Previous Mossbauer and EPR studies of the MoFe protein (approximately 30 Fe and 2 Mo) of nitrogenase have revealed the presence of two unique clusters, namely, the P-clusters (presumably of the Fe4S4 type) and the molybdenum- and iron-containing cofactors (or M-clusters). Mossbauer components D (approximately 10-12 Fe) and Fe2+ (approximately 4 Fe) represent subsites of the P-clusters while component S (approximately 2 Fe) appeared to belong to a separate, unidentified cluster. In order to refine the analyses of Mossbauer spectra, we have constructed an isotopic hybrid of the Klebsiella pneumoniae protein which contains 57Fe-enriched P-clusters and 56Fe-enriched M-clusters. The highly resolved 57Fe Mossbauer spectra of this hybrid show that component S behaves spectroscopically like the P-cluster sites D and Fe2+ in oxidized and reduced MoFe protein. This suggests that S is a subset of the P-clusters rather than a different cluster type. The present study shows, for the first time, that the Debye-Waller factors of different P-cluster subsites have a different temperature dependence. Thus, the Fe2+/D absorption ratio is 4.0:10.0 at 4.2 K and 4.0:11.6 at 173 K. We propose that the reduced MoFe protein contains two pairs of P-clusters: one pair containing one Fe2+ and three D-sites and the other one Fe2+, two D, and one S-site. We have argued previously that the oxidized P-clusters occur in pairs as well."
https://openalex.org/W2038854083,"Rana esculenta tropomyosin assembles in vivo into a coiled-coil alpha helix from two different subunits, alpha and beta, which are present in about equal concentrations. Although the native composition is alpha beta, a mixture of equal amounts of alpha alpha and beta beta is produced by refolding dissociated alpha and beta at low temperature in vitro. Refolding kinetics showed that alpha alpha formed first and was relatively stable with regard to chain exchange below approximately 20 degrees C. Equilibration of the homodimer mixture at 30 degrees and 34 degrees C for long times, however, resulted in the formation of the native alpha beta molecule by chain exchange. Biosynthesis of alpha beta from separate alpha and beta genes is, therefore, favored thermodynamically over the formation of homodimers, and biological factors need not be invoked to explain the preferred native alpha beta composition."
https://openalex.org/W2166368972,"We have previously shown that the rapid clearance of intravenously injected lactate dehydrogenase M4 from plasma is mainly due to endocytosis by macrophages in liver, spleen, and bone marrow. We have now studied endocytosis of lactate dehydrogenase M4 in detail, using freshly isolated rat liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) in vitro. 125I-lactate dehydrogenase M4 rapidly accumulated in the cells and was subsequently degraded to trichloroacetic acid-soluble material. Degradation was inhibited by leupeptin, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteases. Breakdown of the protein was also greatly diminished by treatment of the cells with chloroquine, a weak base which inhibits proteolysis by raising the pH in endosomes and lysosomes. High concentrations of chloroquine inhibited uptake. Lactate dehydrogenase M4 was not endocytosed by liver endothelial cells, although, under the same conditions, these cells were shown to accumulate horse radish peroxidase via a mannose-specific receptor. Uptake of lactate dehydrogenase M4 by Kupffer cells was strongly reduced after pretreatment of the cells with low concentrations of proteases. Endocytosis of lactate dehydrogenase M4 exhibited saturation kinetics (Km = 0.8 microM) and was competitively inhibited by mitochondrial and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, adenylate kinase, and creatine kinase MM, enzymes which are rapidly cleared in vivo. Enzymes with long half-lives in plasma, namely lactate dehydrogenase H4, alanine aminotransferase, and cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase did not compete at concentrations up to 10 microM. Our results indicate that Kupffer cells contain a receptor that is involved in the clearance of lactate dehydrogenase M4 and a number of other tissue-derived enzymes from plasma. Uptake of lactate dehydrogenase M4 does not occur via a receptor that recognizes carbohydrate residues, for the enzyme is not a glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1518281618,"Abstract Amiloride is capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis in mammalian cells in culture. Recent evidence indicates that the enzyme, DNA topoisomerase II, is probably required for DNA synthesis to occur in situ. In experiments to determine the mechanism of inhibition of DNA synthesis by amiloride, we observed that amiloride inhibited both the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro and DNA topoisomerase II-dependent cell functions in vivo. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. Thus, we performed studies to determine if and how amiloride bound to DNA. Results indicated that amiloride 1) shifted the thermal denaturation profile of DNA, 2) increased the viscosity of linear DNA, and 3) unwound circular DNA, all behavior consistent with a DNA intercalation mechanism. Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative measurements of amiloride fluorescence indicated that amiloride (a) bound reversibly to purified DNA under conditions of physiologic ionic strength, and (b) bound to purified nuclei in a highly cooperative manner. Lastly, amiloride did not promote the cleavage of DNA in the presence of DNA topoisomerase II, indicating that the mechanism by which amiloride inhibited DNA topoisomerase II was not through the stabilization of a cleavable complex formed between DNA topoisomerase II, DNA, and amiloride. The ability of amiloride to intercalate with DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II is consistent with the proposed planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic nature of amiloride's most stable conformation. Thus, DNA and DNA topoisomerase II must be considered as new cellular targets of amiloride action."
https://openalex.org/W1493055704,"Treatment with low physiological concentrations of epinephrine (5-50 nM) rapidly desensitizes β-adrenergic stimulation of cAMP formation in S49 wild-type (WT) lymphoma cells. Previous attempts to detect this early phase of desensitization in cell-free assays of adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) after intact cell treatment were unsuccessful. We have now found that reducing the Mg2+ concentrations in the adenylate cyclase assays to <1.0 mm unmasked this rapid phase of desensitization of the WT cells, and that high Mg2+ concentrations (5-10 mm) largely obscured the desensitization. Submillimolar Mg2+ conditions also revealed a two- to threefold decrease in the affinity of epinephrine binding to the β-adrenergic receptor after desensitization with 20 nm epinephrine. Detection of 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) desensitization of the WT β-adrencrgic receptor was also dependent on low Mg2+ as measured either by the decrease in epinephrine stimulation of adenylate cyclase or by the reduction in the affinity of epinephrine binding. Unexpectedly, when cyc− cells were pretreated with 50 nm epinephrine, the β-adrenergic stimulation of reconstituted adenylate cyclase was not desensitized. The characteristics of the Mg2+ effect on epinephrine- and PMA-induced desensitizations suggest a similar mechanism of action with the most likely events being phosphorylations of the β-adrenergic receptors. Our data indicate that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37) may play a role in the desensitization caused by low epinephrine concentrations inasmuch as this phase of desensitization did not occur in the cyc−. For the PMA-induced desensitization, the phosphorylation may be mediated by protein kinase C (EC 2.7.1.37).—Clark, R. B.; Friedman, J.; Johnson, J. A.; Kunkel, M.

https://openalex.org/W1531813454,"A corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) binding protein has been identified based on the chemical cross-linking of ovine [Nle21,m-125I-Tyr32]CRF (125I-oCRF) to bovine anterior pituitary membranes using disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS). The apparent molecular weight of the cross-linked complex determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography was approximately 75,000 and was slightly decreased in its nonreduced state, suggesting the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds. Subtracting the molecular weight of 125I-oCRF, the binding protein appeared to have a molecular weight of approximately 70,000. The cross-linking was specific since an excess (1 microM) of an unrelated peptide (insulin) did not affect the appearance of the Mr 75,000 band. The concentration of CRF required to inhibit cross-linking by 50% was found to be similar to that determined for bovine pituitary CRF receptors by radioreceptor assay. The nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate dose dependently inhibited the cross-linking of 125I-oCRF to the Mr 70,000 protein. 50 nM of the inactive CRF analogue, [Ala14]oCRF, had no effect on the cross-linking, an observation which is consistent with this compound's low potencies in bioassays and radioreceptor assays. These results strongly suggest that this Mr 70,000 protein is the biological bovine anterior pituitary CRF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2022090973,"Many spontaneous mutations are caused by the insertion or excision of DNA elements. Since most mutations are deleterious, evolution should favor a mechanism for genetically controlling the rate of movement of transposable elements in most, if not all, organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster a syndrome of correlated genetic changes, including mutation, chromosome breakage, and sterility, is observed in the hybrid progeny of crosses between different strains. This syndrome, which is termed hybrid dysgenesis, results from the movement of P-DNA elements. What is not clear is whether the movement of other types of transposable elements is under the same coordinated control. In this study the ability of hybrid dysgenesis to increase the rate of excision of 12 DNA elements at 16 mutant alleles and to induce insertion-bearing mutations to change to other mutant states was tested. The data show that hybrid dysgenesis caused by P-element transpositions does not act as a general stimulus for the movement of other Drosophila transposable elements."
https://openalex.org/W2056232165,"Previous studies have indicated the existence of two separate pools of phosphoinositides in WRK-1 cells; one is labile and hormone-sensitive with respect to turnover, while the other is stable. Hormonal stimulation results in a rapid increase in 32Pi incorporation into the sensitive pool, while in the absence of hormone, incorporation of 32Pi into this pool is slow. Results are quite different when [3H]inositol is the precursor utilized. Incorporation of [3H]inositol into hormone-sensitive phosphoinositides is not stimulated in the presence of hormone, suggesting entry of this exogenous precursor into the cycle by a route other than the resynthetic phase of the cycle. Furthermore, failure of hormone to induce loss of [3H]phosphoinositide in pulse-chase experiments in the absence of lithium suggests reutilization of the [3H]inositol moiety generated by phosphodiesteratic cleavage of hormone-sensitive phosphoinositide. Time course studies indicate that the relative rates of incorporation of [3H]inositol into sensitive and insensitive phosphoinositide remain constant from 2 to 24 h. Several factors are capable of increasing [3H]inositol incorporation into hormone-insensitive phosphoinositide including vasopressin, calcium ionophores, and manganese. On the other hand, vasopressin treatment appears to decrease incorporation of [3H]inositol into the hormone-sensitive pool, probably by shifting the equilibrium between phosphoinositides and inositol phosphates, since the decrease in radioactivity observed in the phosphoinositides is equaled by the increase observed in that in the inositol phosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1984175761,"A sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) messenger RNA encoding a protein (SpEGF2) related to epidermal growth factor (EGF) was identified. The full-length complementary DNA sequence predicts a protein with an unusually simple structure, including four tandem EGF-like repeats and a hydrophobic leader, but lacking a potential transmembrane domain. Sequence similarities suggest that the peptides are homologous to two peptides from a different sea urchin species, which cause a classic developmental defect, exogastrulation, when added to the seawater outside of embryos. The SpEGF2 messenger RNA begins to accumulate at blastula stage, and in pluteus larvae it is distributed in discrete regions of ectoderm that are not congruent with known histological borders. One region corresponds to that expressing the homeodomain-containing protein, SpHbox1. The structure of the SpEGF2 protein and the pattern of accumulation of its messenger RNA suggest that it may have important functions as a secreted factor during development of sea urchin embryos."
https://openalex.org/W1551318802,"Genomic clones corresponding to the amino-terminal propeptide and 5'-flanking sequences of the chicken pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene were isolated as a first step in the identification of DNA sequences important for transcriptional regulation of the pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene. Due to the failure to identify positive clones in either primary or amplified genomic libraries, a 5.1-kilobase pair StuI genomic fragment identified by Southern blotting was enriched by sucrose gradient fractionation of genomic DNA and cloned into lambda gt11. Comparison of the DNA sequence of the 5.1-kilobase pair StuI fragment to the DNA sequence of a cDNA clone encoding the amino-terminal propeptide, signal peptide, and the 5'-untranslated region identified the first four exons and most of the fifth. Exon size and intron position have been largely conserved between human and chicken alpha 1(I) genes. DNA sequence analysis of the region 5' to the transcription initiation site identified the canonical TATA and CAAT boxes. However, the 40-nucleotide pyrimidine stretch centered between -150 and -180 nucleotides, found in all previously isolated type I procollagen genes from chicken, mouse, and human, was absent in the chicken pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene. This sequence corresponds to the in vivo DNase I hypersensitive site in the chicken pro-alpha 2(I) and mouse pro-alpha 1(I) collagen genes, as well as the in vitro S1 nuclease hypersensitive site in both chicken and mouse pro-alpha 2(I) collagen genes. Two unusual DNA sequences were identified within the chicken pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene. Fifteen tandem repeats of the sequence GGGGAGA were identified within the first intron, 300 nucleotides 3' to the first exon. This sequence was identified due to its hypersensitivity to S1 nuclease in vitro in supercoiled plasmids. The second sequence located 5' to -180 contained at least 25 copies of a polymorphic, 23-base pair tandemly repeated sequence not identified in other type I procollagen genes. Both of these tandem repeat sequences were identified at other locations in the chicken genome by Southern blot hybridization."

https://openalex.org/W1551842455,"The light-harvesting complex II of thylakoid membranes channels light energy into the photosynthetic reaction center II. The major apoproteins of this complex are the nuclear encoded light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-proteins (LHCP). A model for the arrangement of LHCP in the thylakoid membrane predicts three alpha-helical membrane-spanning regions. The first and third putative membrane-spanning regions include oppositely charged amino acid residues. When the first and third helices are altered to carry only positive charges, the in vitro accumulation of LHCP in the complex is reduced. This mutation is partially rescued by the introduction of a new negative charge in the third helix, an arrangement that is reversed from the wild type. An arginine in the first helix is also important in some aspect of the process leading to the successful accumulation of the LHCP in thylakoids."
