https://openalex.org/W1514066364,"In the rabbit mesenteric arterial smooth muscle skinned by saponin, Ca2+ induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. Guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, lowered the Ca2+ concentrations required for this contraction and increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of the skinned smooth muscle contraction. GTP gamma S alone did not induce the contraction in the absence of Ca2+. This GTP gamma S-enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity was completely abolished by an exoenzyme of Staphylococcus aureus, named EDIN, and an exoenzyme of Clostridium botulinum, named C3, both of which are known to ADP-ribosylate the rho p21 family that belongs to the ras p21-like small GTP-binding protein superfamily. The GTP gamma S-bound form of rhoA p21 overcame the inhibitory action of EDIN. smg p21B, another small GTP-binding protein, was inactive. EDIN ADP-ribosylated a protein, which was most likely to be rho p21, in the skinned smooth muscle. The GTP gamma S-bound form of rhoA p21, but not the GDP-bound form, substituted for GTP gamma S and enhanced the Ca2+ sensitivity of the skinned smooth muscle contraction. smg p21B was inactive. These results indicate that rhoA p21 is involved in the GTP gamma S-enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity of the smooth muscle contraction."

https://openalex.org/W1517182987,"Lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins during serum withdrawal is stimulated by a member of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (hsp70) family (Chiang, H.-L., Terlecky, S. R., Plant, C. P., and Dice, J. F. (1989) Science 246, 382-385). This hsp70, isolated by affinity chromatography with RNase S-peptide-Sepharose, is referred to as the 73-kDa peptide recognition protein (prp73). We now report that prp73 binds to several proteins and peptides whose degradative rates are increased during serum withdrawal. prp73 also binds to the pentapeptide, KFERQ, and more weakly to most modified RNase S-peptide derivatives with a single amino acid substitution within the KFERQ sequence. Taken together, these results suggest that prp73 binds to a variety of proteins at peptide regions biochemically related to KFERQ. Three lines of evidence indicate that prp73 is the heat shock cognate protein of 73 kDa (hsc73): (a) among five hsp70s tested, hsc73 binds to RNase S-peptide most avidly, (b) both prp73 and hsc73 also bind to RNase A and aspartate aminotransferase but not to ovalbumin, lysozyme, or ubiquitin, and (c) both prp73 and hsc73 promote uptake and degradation of [3H] RNase S-peptide by lysosomes in vitro, while three other hsp70s are without activity in this assay."
https://openalex.org/W1517312424,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), when added simultaneously to a human osteosarcoma cell line, MG-63, induce alkaline phosphatase activity 40-70-fold over basal levels, 6-7-fold over 1,25D3 treatment alone, and 15-20-fold over TGF beta treatment alone. TGF beta and 1,25D3 synergistically increased alkaline phosphatase specific activity in both matrix vesicles and plasma membrane isolated from the cultures, but the specific activity was greater in and targeted to the matrix vesicle fraction. Inhibitor and cleavage studies proved that the enzymatic activity was liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase. Preincubation of MG-63 cells with TGF beta for 30 min before addition of 1,25D3 was sufficient for maximal induction of enzyme activity. Messenger RNA for liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase was increased 2.1-fold with TGF beta, 1.7-fold with 1,25D3, and 4.8-fold with the combination at 72 h. Human alkaline phosphatase protein as detected by radioimmunoassay was stimulated only 6.3-fold over control levels with the combination. This combination of factors was tested for their effect on production of three other osteoblast cell proteins: collagen type I, osteocalcin, and fibronectin. TGF beta inhibited 1,25D3-induced osteocalcin production, whereas both factors were additive for fibronectin and collagen type I production. TGF beta appears to modulate the differentiation effects of 1,25D3 on this human osteoblast-like cell and thereby retain the cell in a non-fully differentiated state."

https://openalex.org/W1604340849,"The asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains of human von Willebrand factor (vWF) purified from pooled plasma were quantitatively liberated from the polypeptide moiety by hydrazinolysis. After N-acetylation, these were fractionated by paper electrophoresis and sequential chromatography on lectin-affinity columns of concanavalin A, Phaseolus vulgaris erythrophytohemagglutinin, Datura stramonium agglutinin, Ricinus communis agglutinin 120, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I and on a Bio-Gel P-4 column. Their structures were investigated by sequential exoglycosidase digestion in conjunction with methylation analysis. The glycoprotein was shown to be unique in its great diversity of oligosaccharide structures. Another noteworthy finding which had not been reported previously was the occurrence of asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains with blood group A, B, and H(O) structures. In the present study, this glycoprotein was shown to contain mono- (0.4% of the total oligosaccharides), bi-(78.2%), tri- (12.3%), and tetraantennary (2.3%) complex type oligosaccharides in addition to a series of high mannose type oligosaccharides, Man6-9GlcNAc2 (0.8%). Biantennary complex type oligosaccharide chains were those with (8.2%) and without (70.0%) a bisecting GlcNAc residue and approximately 13.2%, 2.2%, and 0.4% of these contained blood group H(O), A, and B structures, respectively. The tri- and tetraantennary complex type chains were those with and without N-acetyllactosamine repeats, and about 13.0% of the triantennary chains without the N-acetyllactosamine repeat contained the blood group H(O) structure. Occurrence of these asparagine-linked oligosaccharides with blood group A and B structures suggest that the repeated use of factor VIII/vWF pooled concentrate for the treatment of hemophiliacs could result in the production of antibodies against vWF with a different blood group from that of the patient, and this development may be pathogenic."
https://openalex.org/W1518079854,"Human von Willebrand factor, a plasma glycoprotein which plays a critical role in regulating hemostasis, binds heparin, but the physiological importance and mode of this interaction is poorly understood. Using the motif of an amino acid sequence of a consensus heparin binding synthetic peptide, a 23-residue sequence (Tyr565-Ala587) of human von Willebrand factor was identified that retains the consensus motif and binds heparin with affinity comparable with native von Willebrand factor and the consensus peptide. In a fluid phase binding assay, the Tyr565-Ala587 peptide competed effectively with von Willebrand factor for binding heparin. Synthesis and testing of peptides overlapping Tyr565-Ala587, as well as adjacent cationic regions, showed this core sequence to be the optimal linear binding domain. Far ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrometry of the Tyr565-Ala587 peptide suggested that the peptide undergoes conformational change upon binding heparin. The Tyr565-Ala587 peptide thus encompasses part (or all) of a functionally important heparin binding domain of von Willebrand factor. Further study of this and related peptides may be useful for exploring how heparin may influence von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet hemostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1535685697,"NF-Y is a highly conserved transcription factor which recognizes CCAAT motifs in a variety of genes. We report here the genomic organization of the genes encoding both subunits, which gives interesting clues about the functional organization of the proteins. We also report the existence of isoforms of NF-YA which result from differential splicing. These alternative splicing events map within a glutamine-rich activation domain and show a marked cell- and tissue-specific bias."
https://openalex.org/W1971650423,"The x-ray structure of T4 endonuclease V, an enzyme responsible for the first step of a pyrimidine-dimer-specific excision-repair pathway, was determined at a 1.6-angstrom resolution. The enzyme consists of a single compact domain classified into an all-alpha structure. This single domain has two distinct catalytic activities; it functions as a pyrimidine dimer glycosylase and as an apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease. The amino-terminal segment penetrates between two major helices and prevents their direct contact. The refined structure suggests the residues involved in the substrate binding and the catalysis of the glycosylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1495669658,"The major phospholipase A2 activity in sheep platelets is mediated by at least three chromatographically resolvable isoforms of a 30-kDa dimeric polypeptide which are responsive to physiologic increments in calcium ion and possess a dramatic substrate selectivity (Loeb, L. A., and Gross, R. W. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10467-10470). Herein, we describe the cloning and expression of the human equivalent of one such isoform and demonstrate that it catalyzes the cleavage of the sn-2 fatty acid of choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids through the formation of a stable acyl-enzyme intermediate. Transesterification of the sn-2 acyl group of phosphatidylcholine to the recombinant 30-kDa polypeptide is over 50-fold selective for arachidonic acid, is augmented by calcium ion, and results in the formation of an arachidonoyl-thioester intermediate. Homology analysis demonstrated that the polypeptide mediating this transesterification is one member of a family of proteins collectively designated as 14-3-3 proteins. These results demonstrate that at least one intracellular mammalian phospholipase A2 employs a catalytic strategy distinct from that utilized by extracellular phospholipases A2 (i.e. formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate by nucleophilic attack versus activation of a water molecule) and that arachidonic acid in endogenous phospholipid storage depots can, in principle, be sequentially transferred through an acyl-enzyme intermediate without the prior obligatory release of free arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1538234422,"Proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) of Bacillus subtilis were overexpressed, purified to near homogeneity, and characterized. The proteins isolated include Enzyme I, HPr, the glucose-specific IIA domain of the glucose-specific Enzyme II (IIAglc), and the mannitol-specific IIA protein, IIAmtl. Site specific mutant proteins of IIAglc and HPr were also overexpressed and purified, and their properties were compared with those of the wild type proteins. These proteins and their phosphorylated derivatives were characterized with respect to their immunological cross-reactivities employing the Western blot technique and in terms of their migratory behavior during sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing. The interactions between homologous and heterologous Enzymes I and HPrs, between homologous and heterologous HPrs and the IIAglc proteins, and between homologous and heterologous IIAglc proteins and IIBCscr of B. subtilis as well as IICBglc of Escherichia coli were defined and compared kinetically. The mutant HPrs and IIAglc proteins were also characterized kinetically as PTS phosphocarrier proteins and/or as inhibitors of the phosphotransferase reactions of the PTS. These studies revealed that complexation of IIAglc with the mutant form of HPr in which serine 46 was replaced by aspartate (S46D) did not increase the rate of phosphoryl transfer from phospho Enzyme I to S46D HPr more than when IIAmtl was complexed to S46D HPr. These findings do not support a role for HPr(Ser-P) in the preferential utilization of one PTS carbohydrate relative to another. Functional analyses in E. coli established that IIAglc of B. subtilis can replace IIAglc of E. coli with respect both to sugar transport and to regulation of non-PTS permeases, catabolic enzymes, and adenylate cyclase. Site-specific mutations in histidyl residues 68 and 83 (H68A and H83A) inactivated IIAglc of B. subtilis with respect to phosphoryl transfer and its various regulatory roles."
https://openalex.org/W1567342850,"Thioredoxin (Trx) from Escherichia coli was compared with bovine protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI) for its ability to catalyze native disulfide formation in either reduced or randomly oxidized (scrambled) ribonuclease A (RNase). On a molar basis, a 100-fold higher concentration of Trx than of PDI was required to give the same rate of native disulfide formation measured as recovery of RNase activity. A Pro-34 to His (P34H Trx) mutation in the active site of E. coli Trx (WCGPC), mimicking the two suggested active sites in PDI (WCGHC), increased the catalytic activity in disulfide formation about 10-fold. The mutant P34H Trx displayed a 35-mV higher redox potential (E'0) of the active site disulfide/dithiol relative to wild type Trx, making it more similar to the redox potential observed for PDI. This higher redox potential correlates well with the enhanced activity and suggests a role for the histidine side chain. Enzymatic isomerization of disulfides in scrambled, oxidized RNase requires the presence of a catalytic thiol such as GSH to initiate the thiol-disulfide interchange. Bovine thioredoxin reductase, together with NADPH, could replace GSH. For oxidative folding of reduced RNase in air with Trx, P34H Trx, or PDI, catalytic amounts of sodium selenite (1 microM) resulted in rapid disulfide formation and high yields of ribonuclease activity equivalent to previously known redox buffers of GSH and GSSG. These results demonstrate no obligatory role for glutathione in disulfide formation. A possible mechanism for the unknown thiol oxidative process accompanying folding and protein disulfide formation in vivo is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1494524983,"A thiocyanate hydrolase that catalyzes the first step in thiocyanate degradation was purified to homogeneity from Thiobacillus thioparus, an obligate chemolithotrophic eubacterium metabolizing thiocyanate to sulfate as an energy source. The thiocyanate hydrolase was purified 52-fold by steps involving ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography, and hydroxylapatite column chromatography. The enzyme hydrolyzed 1 mol of thiocyanate to form 1 mol of carbonyl sulfide and 1 mol of ammonia as follows: SCN- + 2H2O----COS + NH3 + OH-. This is the first report describing the hydrolysis of thiocyanate to carbonyl sulfide by an enzyme. The enzyme had a molecular mass of 126 kDa and was composed of three different subunits: alpha (19 kDa), beta (23 kDa), and gamma (32 kDa). The enzyme exhibited optimal activities at pH 7.5-8.0 and at temperatures ranging from 30 to 40 degrees C. The Km value for thiocyanate was approximately 11 mM. Immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies against the purified enzyme suggested that it was induced in T. thioparus cells when the cells were grown with thiocyanate."
https://openalex.org/W1784451342,"We have used a preparation of soluble human insulin receptor ectodomain and a novel photoreactive, biotinylated derivative of insulin (4-azidosalicyloyl(B1-biocytinyl-B2-lysine)-insulin) to identify a new hormone contact site within the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor. The ectodomain was photoaffinity-labeled and digested to completion with trypsin, and the resulting tryptic fragment was purified by either HPLC or by streptavidin-affinity chromatography. The amino terminus of the fragment was identified as Gly390 within the alpha-subunit. These results suggest that residues that are carboxyl-terminal to the cysteine-rich domain, in addition to previously identified regions within the amino terminus of the alpha-subunit, contribute to the insulin binding site. The implications of these results for the de novo folding of the insulin receptor to constitute the hormone binding site are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1575137033,"To study the relationship between transcription and strand-specific repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, dimer removal was analyzed in a cell line containing two alleles of an inactivated adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene. The cell line was derived from a patient suffering from severe combined immunodeficiency. The disease was caused by a deletion of the complete promoter of the gene as well as the first exon of the ADA gene. This resulted in a true null allele without any detectable transcription (Berkvens, T.M., Gerritsen, E. J. A., Oldenburg, M., Breukel, C., Wijnen, J. T. H., Van Ormondt, H., Vossen, J. M., Van der Eb, A. J., and Meera Khan, P. (1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15, 9365-9378). Despite this lack of transcription, repair of the ADA gene in this cell line was found to be very efficient with 80% of the dimers being removed within 24 h after UV irradiation. However, the initial rapid repair which is associated with the transcribed strand in normal cells is absent. Dimer removal from two inactive loci, 754 and coagulation factor IX, was much less efficient with only 40% dimers removed after 24 h. From this data, we conclude that transcription is not required for efficient repair of a gene, but forms an additional signal for accelerated repair of the transcribed strand. Furthermore, we suggest that different levels of repair exist between non-transcribed sequences in active genes and those in repressed loci. The results are discussed in terms of the current ideas about the mechanism of preferential DNA repair in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1485363868,"Interleukin-1 beta and forskolin induce prostaglandin E2 release as well as 14-kDa group II phospholipase A2 gene expression and secretion of the enzyme from rat glomerular mesangial cells. We now report that pretreatment of mesangial cells with transforming growth factor-beta 2 prior to stimulation with interleukin-1 beta or forskolin inhibits the induced release of prostaglandin E2. At the same time the secretion of group II phospholipase A2, measured both as enzyme activity with sn-2-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine as substrate and as enzyme protein in immunoblot experiments, is dose-dependently inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with transforming growth factor-beta 2. Analyses of enzyme activity and enzyme protein levels in the cells indicated that this is not due to inhibition of enzyme secretion with a concomitant increase in cellular levels of the enzyme. Rather, pretreatment of the cells with transforming growth factor-beta 2 largely prevented both the interleukin-1 beta- and the forskolin-induced synthesis of phospholipase A2. This is the first report indicating an inhibition of group II phospholipase A2 gene expression by transforming growth factor-beta 2. In line with those results, transforming growth factor-beta 2 did not induce the synthesis and secretion of group II phospholipase A2. However, under conditions where the interleukin-1 beta-induced expression of group II phospholipase A2 is fully suppressed by transforming growth factor-beta 2, the growth factor itself stimulated prostaglandin E2 synthesis by a mechanism apparently not involving group II phospholipase A2. The immunochemical identification of the inducible and secretable phospholipase A2 from rat mesangial cells as a group II enzyme was confirmed by purification and N-terminal amino acid sequence determination."
https://openalex.org/W1511264100,"Anaerobically grown Escherichia coli contain an enzymatically active iron superoxide dismutase (Fe2-FeSOD) and an inactive iron-substituted manganese superoxide dismutase (Fe2-MnSOD). The anaerobic electron sink, nitrate plus paraquat, enhanced biosynthesis of the MnSOD polypeptide, with accumulation of inactive Fe2-MnSOD. The oxidant, diamide, in contrast, allowed anaerobic production of the active forms of MnSOD, i.e. Mn2-MnSOD and Mn/Fe-MnSOD. Nutritional supplementation with Mn(II) favored occupancy of the MnSOD active site with manganese and allowed anaerobic accumulation of Mn2-MnSOD in the absence of diamide. Enrichment of the anaerobic growth medium with Fe(II) both suppressed biosynthesis of the MnSOD polypeptide and inhibited formation of the active manganese-containing forms. A tac-sodA operon fusion was used to examine the effects of chelating agents and metals on maturation of nascent MnSOD, independent from the transcriptional effects these agents impose. Isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) elicited anaerobic biosynthesis of MnSOD, which accumulated as the inactive Fe2-MnSOD. Diamide, with IPTG, allowed formation of active Mn/Fe-MnSOD while 1,10-phenanthroline with IPTG resulted in accumulation of Mn2-MnSOD. These results suggest that iron participates in the redox-sensitive control of the formation of active MnSOD at two levels, i.e. that of transcription as well as that of maturation. During maturation of the nascent MnSOD polypeptide, iron and manganese compete for the metal-binding site; anaerobic conditions favor iron-binding, whereas oxidants, such as dioxygen or diamide, favor binding of manganese."
https://openalex.org/W1603336438,"The mechanisms that mediate the labile binding of apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) to high density lipoproteins (HDL) are not known. We therefore used a surface balance and surface radioactivity detector to investigate the adsorption of apoA-IV to egg phosphatidylcholine monolayers spread at the air/water interface. ApoA-IV bound rapidly and reversibly to phospholipid monolayers and generated a maximum increase in surface pressure of 19 millinewtons (mN)/m at a subphase concentration of 2 x 10(-5) g/dl. Binding decreased linearly with increasing initial surface pressure; at pressures greater than 28-29 mN/m, apoA-IV could no longer penetrate the lipid monolayer. The area occupied by the amino acid residues in apoA-IV reached an unusually low limiting molecular area of 10-12 A2/residue at surface saturation. The surface pressure of native HDL3 was calculated to be 33 mN/m, and it rapidly decreased with the action of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase on the particle surface. We conclude that the surface activity of apoA-IV is lower than that of any other human apolipoprotein; its binding and surface conformation are particularly sensitive to pressure; and at saturation, a significant portion of the molecule is excluded from the interface. The exclusion pressure of apoA-IV may be only slightly lower than the surface pressure of HDL; in vivo, the action of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase and lipid transfer proteins may cause the HDL3 surface pressure to oscillate about a narrow range that spans the exclusion pressure of apoA-IV. The resultant labile association of apoA-IV and HDL may be of central importance to its role in lipoprotein metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2110912964,"The gene of the sodium-dependent citrate transport system from Klebsiella pneumoniae (citS) is located on plasmid pES3 (Schwarz, E., and Oesterhelt, D. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 1599-1603) and encodes a 446-amino acid protein. Transport of citrate via this citrate transport protein (CitS) is dependent on the presence of sodium ions and is inhibited by magnesium ions. The delta pH (pH gradient across the membrane) is the major driving force for uptake. It is postulated that, in analogy with the proton-dependent citrate carrier (CitH) of K. pneumoniae (van der Rest, M. E., Abee, T., Molenaar, D., and Konings, W. N. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 195, 71-77), only one of the protonated species of citrate is recognized by CitS and that citrate is translocated across the membrane in symport with protons and sodium ions. The hydrophobicity profile of CitS suggests that the protein is very hydrophobic and contains 12 membrane-spanning segments. These segments are not centered around a hydrophilic core as has been suggested for other transport proteins, but the protein is asymmetrical with seven transmembrane segments in front of a large hydrophilic loop and five after this loop. The amino acid sequence is highly similar to a citrate transport system of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis var. diacetylactis (CitP) (David, S., van der Rest, M. E., Driessen, A. J. M., Simons, G., and de Vos, W. M. (1990) J. Bacteriol. 172, 5789-5794) and less similar to CitH of K. pneumoniae. We conclude that the citS gene of K. pneumoniae encodes a sodium-dependent citrate transport system that belongs to a novel subclass of transport proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1585576609,"Tetanus toxin was shown to contain a metal-binding site for zinc and copper. Equilibrium dialysis binding experiments using 65Zn indicated an association constant of 9-15 microM, with one zinc-binding site/toxin molecule. The zinc-binding site was localized to the toxin light chain as determined by binding of 65Zn to the light chain but not to the heavy chain after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to Immobilon membranes. Copper was an efficient inhibitor of 65Zn binding to tetanus toxin and caused two peptide bond cleavages in the toxin light chain in the presence of ascorbate. These metal-catalyzed oxidative cleavages were inhibited by the presence of zinc. Partial characterization of metal-catalyzed oxidative modifications of a peptide based on a putative metal-binding site (HELIH) in the toxin light chain was used to map the metal-binding site in the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1586323548,"One of insulin's actions is the induction of DNA synthesis and cell division, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. Previous studies indicate that insulin stimulates cell division and regulates the expression of several genes in rat H4IIE (H4) hepatoma cells. One of these genes is the proto-oncogene c-fos, a cellular gene whose deregulation has been implicated in the process of cellular differentiation and division. We have shown that insulin induces transcription of the c-fos gene in H4 cells. In the present study, the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), stimulated c-fos transcription in a rapid and dose-dependent manner with an 800% increase in transcription following 15-30 min of addition. This increase in c-fos transcription was transitory, returning towards baseline transcription rates within 120 min. PMA stimulated the translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) from the cytoplasm to the membrane in H4 hepatoma cells, as evidenced by a 77% decrease in cytosolic PKC and a 29% increase in membrane PKC activity following 10 min of treatment. Insulin addition to H4 cells for 10 min also resulted in a 31% decrease in cytosolic PKC activity, suggesting a translocation response. When H4 cells were pretreated with PMA for 24 h, there was a decrease of 20-45% in both cytosolic and membrane PKC activity and a complete loss of PMA's induction of c-fos transcription. Thus, the cells were functionally desensitized to further PMA addition. When cells were pretreated with PMA for 24 h, the insulin-induced increase in transcription of c-fos was reduced by 50%. Western blot analysis indicated that the PKC-beta isozyme followed a translocation pattern almost identical with that of total PKC activity. These results suggest that a PMA-sensitive form of PKC is preferentially lost upon PMA pretreatment and that this PKC subtype may be necessary for insulin to fully induce c-fos gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1520703264,"Few experimental models have been used to investigate how proteins fold inside a cell. Using the formation of disulfide bonds as an index of conformational changes during protein folding, we have developed a unique system to determine the intracellular folding pathway of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Three folding intermediates of the beta subunit were purified from [35S]cysteine-labeled JAR choriocarcinoma cells by immunoprecipitation and by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To identify unformed disulfide bonds, nonreduced folding intermediates were treated with trypsin to liberate non-disulfide-bound, [35S]cysteine-containing peptides from the disulfide-linked peptides. Released peptides were purified by HPLC and identified by amino acid sequencing. The amount of a peptide that was released indicated the extent of disulfide bond formation involving the cysteine in that peptide. Of the six disulfide bonds in hCG-beta, bonds 34-88 and 38-57 form first. The rate-limiting event of folding involves the formation of the S-S bonds between cysteines 23 and 72 and cysteines 9 and 90. Disulfide bond 93-100, the formation of which appears to be necessary for assembly with the alpha subunit of the hCG heterodimer, forms next. Finally, disulfide bond 26-110 forms after assembly with the alpha subunit, suggesting that completion of folding of the COOH terminus in the beta subunit occurs after assembly with the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2122113360,"The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus is a chimeric protein consisting of an amino-terminal carrier domain and a carboxyl-terminal phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) IIA protein domain. The histidine residues of LacS were changed individually into glutamine or arginine residues. Of the 11 histidine residues present in LacS, only the His-376 substitution in the carrier domain significantly affected sugar transport. The region around His-376 was found to exhibit sequence similarity to the region around His-322 of the lactose transport protein (LacY) of Escherichia coli, which has been implicated in sugar binding and in coupling of sugar and H+ transport. The H376Q mutation resulted in a reduced rate of uptake and altered affinity for lactose (beta-galactoside), melibiose (alpha-galactoside), and the lactose analog methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Similarly, the extent of accumulation of the galactosides by cells expressing LacS(H376Q) was highly reduced in comparison to cells bearing the wild-type protein. Nonequilibrium exchange of lactose and methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside by the H376Q mutant was approximately 2-fold reduced in comparison to the activity of the wild-type transport protein. The data indicate that His-376 is involved in sugar recognition and is important, but not essential, for the cotransport of protons and galactosides. The carboxyl-terminal domain of LacS contains 2 histidine residues (His-537 and His-552) that are conserved in seven homologous IIA protein(s) (domains) of PTSs. P-enolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of wild-type LacS, but not of the mutant H552Q, was demonstrated using purified Enzyme I and HPr, the general energy coupling proteins of the PTS, and inside-out membrane vesicles isolated from E. coli in which the lactose transport gene was expressed. The His-537 and His-552 mutations did not affect transport activity when the corresponding genes were expressed in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1575785934,Protein R2 of ribonucleotide reductase contains a dinuclear ferric iron center adjacent to a tyrosyl radical in the interior of the protein matrix. A patch of hydrophobic residues surrounds the iron-radical cofactor. Its importance during the oxidative generation of the iron-radical cofactor was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis of Phe-208 to tyrosine. The mutant protein R2 F208Y has prominent absorption bands at 460 and 720 nm reminiscent of those in ferric-catecholate complexes. Resonance Raman spectroscopy shows that the iron center of R2 F208Y contains a bidentate catechol ligand. The mechanism for generation of this protein-derived dihydroxyphenylalanine may be similar to the catalytic cycle of methane monooxygenase.

Nine of these fractions were permethylated, analyzed by electron impact-mass spectrometry, and submitted to methylation analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Native fractions were analyzed by liquid secondary ion-mass spectrometry and degraded sequentially by exoglycosidases. In addition to a previously described galactosylceramide, a di-, a tri-, and a tetragalactosyl-ceramide having Gal beta 1-6Gal internal linkages were characterized. This type of carbohydrate chain has been described in glycolipids of a marine mollusk, Turbo cornutus (Matsubara, T., and Hayashi, A. (1981) J. Biochem. (Tokyo), 89, 645-650).

Ceramides contained sphinganine and either nonhydroxy fatty acids with 16, 18, 26, and 28 carbon atoms, or hydroxy fatty acids, with 16 and 18 carbon atoms. Di-, tri-, and tetragalactosylceramides containing the Gal beta 1-6Gal disaccharide were found to be immunogenic in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1580484857,"Phosphorylated ribosomal proteins were isolated from Xenopus 40 S ribosomal subunits by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to enable direct analysis of the phosphorylation sites in ribosomal protein S6. Xenopus S6 closely resembled mammalian S6 with respect to the following properties: (i) reversed-phase HPLC elution behavior, (ii) amino-terminal sequence (96% identity in the first 37 residues), and (iii) an identical sequence within the region of its phosphorylation sites. Whereas S6 was the only ribosomal protein phosphorylated in vitro by Xenopus S6 kinase II, ribosomes phosphorylated in vivo were found to be associated with an additional phosphoprotein having an amino-terminal sequence identical to that of the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal extension protein CEP 80. S6 kinase II phosphorylated at least four sites (serines 1-3 and 5) in the sequence Arg-Arg-Leu-Ser(1)-Ser(2)-Leu-Arg-Ala-Ser(3)-Thr-Ser(4)-Lys-Ser(5)-, which correspond to the residues known to be phosphorylated in the carboxyl-terminal region of mammalian S6. The in vivo S6 phosphorylation sites in maturing Xenopus oocytes were shown to be located within the same cluster of serine residues, although individual sites were not identified. Kinetic analysis of S6 kinase II-catalyzed phosphorylation events indicated a simple sequential mechanism of multisite phosphorylation initiating at either serine 2 (preferred) or serine 1, with the rates of phosphorylation of individual sites occurring in the order serine 2 greater than serine 1 greater than serine 3 greater than serine 5."
https://openalex.org/W1525560801,"In a previous report, we have presented several lines of evidence, derived from widely different methodologies, suggesting that Leishmania has specific receptors for transferrin with a Kd similar to the mammalian transferrin receptor. This paper describes the identification, purification, and biochemical characterization of Leishmania transferrin receptor. The Leishmania transferrin receptor, detected on intact parasites by immunoperoxidase staining, was first identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis, using 125I-transferrin, as a 70-kDa protein. It has been isolated initially from Leishmania infantum promastigotes using affinity chromatography on a transferrin-Sepharose column and, subsequently, from Leishmania major promastigotes. The use of polyclonal antisera to the purified 70-kDa Leishmania transferrin receptor and to the purified rat transferrin receptor showed that the two receptors are antigenically distinct. The 70-kDa Leishmania transferrin receptor was subsequently characterized as an integral membrane glycoprotein. The monomeric state of the Leishmania transferrin receptor was demonstrated by gel filtration of purified receptor complexed with 125I-transferrin. Thus, the Leishmania transferrin receptor, unlike the mammalian receptor, is not a disulfide-linked dimer but a single 70-kDa polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1480092419,"Mammalian ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that stimulate cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, were grouped into three classes based on deduced amino acid sequence. Human ARF 1, a class I ARF, is identical with its bovine counterpart, has a distinctive pattern of tissue and developmental expression, and is encoded by a approximately 1.9-kilobase mRNA. ARF 1 cDNAs were isolated from a human fibroblast cDNA library; one arose via an alternative polyadenylation signal (AA-TACA) 84 nucleotides 5' to the polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) used in the 1815-base pair cDNA. The polyadenylation signals, their respective locations, and the surrounding nucleotide sequences are conserved in human and rat. The human ARF 1 gene, with four introns, spans approximately 16.5 kilobases. Exon 1 (46 base pairs) contains only untranslated sequence. Translation initiates in exon 2, which encodes the sequence GXXXXGK involved in phosphate binding (GTP hydrolysis). The sequence DVGG is encoded in exon 3, and NKQD, which is involved in the interaction with the guanine ring, is interrupted following the codon for Q by intron 4. The carboxyl-terminal 53 amino acids and greater than 1110 base pairs of 3'-untranslated region are encoded in exon 5. Primer extension and mung bean and S1 nuclease mapping indicated multiple transcription initiation sites and were consistent with Northern analyses. The 5'-flanking region has a high GC content but no TATA or CAAT box, as found in housekeeping genes. In addition, the two human class I ARF genes, ARF 1 and ARF 3, have similar exon/intron organizations and use GC-rich promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1512256106,"We have recently characterized a mutant insulin receptor (Y/F2) in which the two tyrosines in the carboxyl terminus (Tyr1316, Tyr1322) were mutated to phenylalanine. Compared with wild type receptors, the Y/F2 receptor exhibited markedly enhanced sensitivity to insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis with normal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Takata, Y., Webster, N. J. G., and Olefsky, J. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9135-9139). In this paper, we present further evidence for the divergence of the metabolic and mitogenic signaling pathways utilized by the insulin receptor. The mutant receptor showed normal sensitivity and responsiveness for insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation into glycogen. The insulin sensitivity for phosphorylation of two substrates (pp180 and pp220) was the same in both Y/F2 cells and HIRc cells. Phosphotyrosine content, however, was greater in Y/F2 cells than in HIRc cells, especially in the basal state. Insulin stimulated S6 kinase activity 2-6-fold, with an ED50 of -10 nM in Rat 1 cells and 0.5 nM in HIRc cells. The sensitivity to insulin was enhanced in Y/F2 cells with an ED50 of 0.1 nM. These effects were insulin-specific, since insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I-stimulated mitogenesis was normal. In summary: 1) Y/F2 receptors exhibit normal metabolic and enhanced mitogenic signaling; 2) the enhanced mitogenic signaling is specific for the insulin receptor in the Y/F2 cells, since IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis is normal; 3) Y/F2 cells display increased endogenous substrate phosphorylation and augmented insulin-stimulated S6 kinase activity placing these responses among insulin's mitogenic effects; and 4) these results are consistent with the concept that the COOH-terminal tyrosine residues of the insulin receptor are normally inhibitory to mitogenic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1512380159,"Regulation of adenovirus major late transcription unit (MLTU) mRNA biosynthesis involves poly(A) site selection between five available sites, L1 through L5. The 5' proximal site completely dominates during early infection, whereas all five sites are used during late infection with L3 being favored slightly over the others. Previous studies have shown this early to late poly(A) switch will occur in the absence of MLTU-specific splicing patterns and hinges in large part on the character of the first poly(A) site. We have used in vitro assays to characterize basic features of the L1 and L3 pre-mRNAs which may help define how processing at poly(A) sites is controlled. We have found that L1 is 5-10-fold less efficient than L3 as a substrate for RNA cleavage. A primary difference between the L1 and L3 sites lies in the kinetics of their use, with cleavage at L3 occurring at twice the rate of cleavage at L1. In addition, L1 is 20-fold less effective than L3 in competing for processing factors. To investigate the sequence elements that contribute to poly(A) site efficiency, we have used competition assays in which the competitor RNAs lack upstream or downstream elements."

From the noncoincidence of the transitions in the near and far UV, the existence of stable intermediate states possessing few persistent tertiary interactions but most of the native-like secondary structure, was inferred. These intermediate states exist at equilibrium under various conditions, namely, state G at 1.7 M GdmHCl (pH 8, 25 degrees C), state A at pH 4 (0.6 M GdmHCl, 25 degrees C) and state T above 68 degrees C. By size exclusion chromatography, their apparent compactness was determined. The intermediate states A, T, and G were compact and are therefore classified as molten globule states."
https://openalex.org/W1486969149,"The Gal/GalNAc-specific lectin on rat peritoneal macrophages (macrophage asialoglycoprotein binding protein, M-ASGP-BP) is structurally similar to rat hepatic asialoglycoprotein-binding protein (ASGP-BP) or rat hepatic lectin (RHL) and is highly homologous with the major component of RHL, RHL-1 (Ii, M, Kurata, H., Itoh, N., Yamashina, I., and Kawasaki, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11295-11298). We found in this study that transfection with a cDNA clone that encodes a single polypeptide, M-ASGP-BP, was sufficient for the expression of an endocytic receptor for asialoorosomucoid (ASOR) on the COS-1 cell surface. The Kuptake value for ASOR for the transfected cells was 12.5 nM, which is similar to that for peritoneal macrophages (23 nM), and the number of ASOR bound on the cell surface was 1-8 x 10(5)/cell, this value being hundreds of times larger than that for peritoneal macrophages. 125I-ASOR bound on the surfaces of the transfected cells was rapidly internalized on incubation at 37 degrees C, and after 90 min of incubation, most of the radioactivity was recovered in acid-soluble degraded products from the medium. These results confirmed that the cDNA cloned in our previous study does in fact encode M-ASGP-BP and also that the single polypeptide chain can form a homooligomeric receptor (probably a hexamer or octamer) exhibiting high affinity for ASOR. The latter property was distinct from that of the hepatic ASGP-BP in that simultaneous transfection of two cloned cDNAs that encode RHL-1 and RHL-2/3 was required to produce an active ASOR receptor (McPhaul, M., and Berg, P. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 8863-8867). This M-ASGP-BP expression system may serve as a simple model with which to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying carbohydrate-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1540528474,"Membranes from brefeldin A-treated and untreated chick embryo epiphyseal cartilage were fractionated separately by equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Fractions were assayed for Gal I transferase, Gal II transferase, Gal ovalbumin transferase, chondroitin polymerization on endogenous acceptors, GalNAc transfer to exogenous chondroitin hexasaccharide, and sulfate transfer to exogenous chondroitin. Gal I transferase and Gal II transferase activities were found in heavier cis- and medial-Golgi fractions, but with distributions different from each other. Brefeldin A had no effect on either their distribution or their total activity. Gal ovalbumin transferase activity in fractions from untreated cartilage was found as a dual peak in medial- and trans-Golgi areas. The latter peak was diminished in the fractions from the brefeldin A-treated cartilage, whereas the former peak was correspondingly increased. A similar dual medial- and trans-Golgi distribution for chondroitin polymerization on endogenous acceptors was seen with fractions from untreated cartilage. This was modified in fractions from brefeldin A-treated cartilage with a complete loss of synthesis in the trans-Golgi peak and a slight increase in synthesis in the medial-Golgi peak. However, the distribution of GalNAc transferase activity using exogenous chondroitin hexasaccharide indicated that considerable chondroitin-synthesizing activity still remained in these trans-Golgi fractions. This demonstrated that brefeldin A had caused a block in movement of endogenous proteochondroitin acceptors to the trans-Golgi site of synthesis. Sulfotransferase activity was also found in a dual distribution similar to that of the chondroitin polymerization and GalNAc transferase, with a small reduction in activity in the trans-Golgi fractions of brefeldin A-treated cartilage. Thus, treatment of cartilage with brefeldin A resulted in the loss of considerable trans-Golgi chondroitin sulfate-synthesizing enzyme activity and a block in the transport of one form of proteochondroitin precursor to the trans-Golgi membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1640481122,"We have employed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines transfected with either the wild type human chorionic gonadotropin beta (hCG-beta) gene alone (CHO beta cells) or in conjunction with the gene expressing the alpha subunit (CHO alpha,beta cells) to study the folding pathway of the hCG-beta subunit. In both CHO beta and CHO alpha,beta cells, the earliest detectable hCG-beta precursor, p beta 1, which had two of six potential disulfide bonds (34-88 and 38-57) formed, was converted to p beta 2, a form that, following the formation of disulfide bonds between cysteines 9-90 and 23-72, migrated more slowly than p beta 1 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. The t1/2 for the conversion of p beta 1 to p beta 2 in CHO alpha,beta and CHO beta cells was 5 min, demonstrating that the alpha subunit had no effect on the rate of this conversion. Furthermore, the tryptic-releasable peptides generated from nonreduced p beta 1 or p beta 2 were the same in both CHO alpha,beta and CHO beta cells. Thus, both the rate and order of disulfide bond formation during the conversion of the folding intermediate p beta 1 into p beta 2 were the same whether or not the alpha subunit was present. A comparison between cell types expressing different alpha/beta subunit ratios revealed that the higher the glycoprotein hormone alpha subunit to beta subunit ratio, the greater the rate and extent of hCG heterodimer assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1484226051,"Abstract A3.01 is a hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine-sensitive, human immunodeficiency virus-susceptible, human T cell line derived by Folks et al. (Folks, T., Benn, S., Rabson, A., Theodore, T., Hoggan, M. D., Martin, M., Lightfoote, M., and Sell, K. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 4539-4543) following exposure of CEM cells to 8-azaguanine. In the present study, it is shown that A3.01 also contains a heretofore unrecognized mutation in cholesterol biosynthesis. A3.01 cells grown in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) contain primarily cholesterol in their membranes, but based on [14C]acetate labeling, synthesize only lanosterol and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol. Reduction in the amount of FBS provided resulted in decreased cellular levels of cholesterol with corresponding increases in the two 4,4',14-trimethyl sterols. In A3.01 cells cultured in 1% FBS medium, lanosterol and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol accounted for 7 and 45%, respectively, of total cellular sterols. Following dilution of the 1% FBS-grown cells into serum-free media, the level of membrane cholesterol gradually declined, such that after three passages it became virtually undetectable, whereas the proportions of lanosterol and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol rose to 25 and 75%, respectively. Even after eight passages in the serum-free media, A3.01 cells displayed a complete absence of cholesterol with no obvious effect on cell growth. Membranes isolated from A3.01 cells grown in the presence or absence of 10 micrograms/ml of cholesterol displayed similar phospholipid:sterol ratios, but membranes from the unsupplemented cells contained only approximately 5% as much cholesterol as the supplemented cell membranes. Finally, A3.01 cells grown in the absence of cholesterol were extremely resistant to the cytotoxic effects of amphotericin B, whereas cells cultured in the combined presence of 1% FCS and 10 micrograms/ml of cholesterol were sensitive to the drug. Collectively, these results demonstrate that 4,4',14-trimethyl sterols can effectively replace cholesterol in a human T cell lineage, indicating that not all mammalian cells have a requirement for cholesterol, per se. The A3.01 T cell lineage should prove useful in defining the role of cholesterol in membrane fusion and human immunodeficiency virus-mediated syncitia formation and cytopathic effects."
https://openalex.org/W1592390035,"The concentrations of the intermediates in the association reaction between human hemoglobin and CO at 20 degrees C, pH 7, under conditions of negligible dissociation of the ligand, were measured by cryogenic techniques. The monoligated species were predominant at all values of overall ligand bound studied. The analysis of the experimental data assuming a scheme of four consecutive reactions indicated that the binding rates increased in a continuous fashion. A significant acceleration after the binding of the second molecule of ligand occurred in the presence of 0.1 M KCl, but not with the addition of an excess of inositol hexaphosphate, indicating that major functional, and possibly structural, transitions occur at the diligated state. Differences in the concentrations of the intermediates in the same state of ligation were observed under all conditions. The analyses of the data on the basis of schemes of multiple pathways of reaction indicated that the beta subunits reacted about 1.5 times faster than the alpha subunits in the first ligation reaction. After the addition of inositol hexaphosphate, the alpha subunits reacted about 1.5 times faster than the beta subunits in the first ligation step, but the overall rate of the first CO binding step was unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W1482005070,"In addition to crystallographic studies that determined antigen contact residues for monoclonal anti-fluorescein (Fl) antibody 4-4-20 (Ka = 2.5 x 10(10) M-1), primary structure comparisons revealed idiotypically cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 9-40 (Ka = 4.4 x 10(7) M-1), 12-40 (Ka = 4.0 x 10(8) M-1), and 5-14 (Ka = 2.4 x 10(8) M-1) possessed identical Fl contact residues, with the exception of L34His for L34Arg. Site-specific mutagenesis of single chain antibody (SCA) 4-4-20 in which L34Arg was changed to L34His resulted in approximately 1000- and 3-fold decreases in binding affinity and Qmax (maximum quenching of bound Fl), respectively, which suggested that L34Arg was directly involved in increased binding affinity and fluorescence quenching. Therefore, substitution of Arg for His at residue L34 in mAbs 9-40, 12-40, and 5-14 should result in increased binding affinity and Qmax. To facilitate site-specific mutagenesis studies, single chain derivatives of mAbs 9-40, 12-40, and 5-14 were constructed. Following expression in Escherichia coli, characterization of the SCAs demonstrated that when compared with the respective parental mAb, the SCAs possessed identical binding affinities and similar Qmax and lambda max (absorption profiles of bound Fl) values. These results validated SCA 9-40, 12-40, and 5-14 for use in site-directed mutagenesis studies. Results of mutagenesis studies indicated that substitution of L34Arg into the active sites of 9-40, 12-40, and 5-14 was not enough to produce 4-4-20-like binding characteristics. Therefore, the following single chain mutants were constructed: 9-40L34Arg/L46Val, 12-40L34Arg/L46Val and 5-14L34Arg/L46Val, 9-40L34Arg/L46Val/H101Asp and 4-4-20H101Ala. Results demonstrated that these mutations were not able to render the mutant SCAs with increased binding affinity and fluorescence quenching values. Collectively, these results suggest that the combining sites of mAb 9-40, 12-40, and 5-14 may possess different active site structures than mAb 4-4-20."
https://openalex.org/W1523927419,"One- and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy have been employed to probe the association and subsequent conformational changes of metal-free insulin in sodium chloride solution at pH 9 and 9.4. These studies establish that the proton resonances of His(B5) and His(B10) are useful signatures of aggregation and conformation. Changes in chemical shifts and areas of resonances due to the C2 protons of His(B10) and His(B5) and transfer of magnetization experiments served to identify the association as the assembly of tetramer from dimers under our experimental conditions (pH 9.4, [insulin] greater than 1 mM, [NaCl] = 0.1 M). Sodium chloride also alters the equilibrium distribution of species in favor of a tetrameric species. The association equilibrium constant was estimated from area measurements to be approximately 5 x 10(3) M-1 at pH 9.4, 26 +/- 0.1 degrees C, and 0.1 M sodium chloride. Under conditions of 0.1 M sodium chloride concentration, nuclear Overhauser effect experiments in the one- and two-dimensional modes revealed an operative nuclear Overhauser effect between the His(B5) C2 protons and the 2,6 ring protons of a Tyr residue provisionally assigned as Tyr(B16). We conclude that this interaction is a diagnostic signature of a conformational transition whereupon an extended chain from residues B1 to B9 (T-state) is transformed into an alpha-helix (R-state) thus bringing the rings of His(B5) and Tyr(B16) from adjacent subunits across the monomer-monomer interface into van der Waals contact. This conformational flexibility is an added consideration to the discussion of the relevant structure of insulin for receptor binding."
https://openalex.org/W2165583978,"Recent studies have shown that a protein-bound heme adduct formed from the reaction of BrCCl3 with myoglobin was due to bonding of the proximal histidine residue through the ring I vinyl of a heme-CCl2 moiety. The present study reveals that BrCCl3 also reacts with the heme of reduced human hemoglobin to form two protein-bound heme adducts. Edman degradation and mass spectrometry provided evidence that these protein-bound heme adducts were addition products in which heme-CCL2 or heme-CCl3 were bound to cysteine residue 93 of the beta-chain of hemoglobin. It appeared that the cysteine residue was bonded regiospecifically to the ring I vinyl group of the altered heme moiety, because the nonprotein-bound products of the reaction included the beta-carboxyvinyl and alpha-hydroxy-beta-trichloromethylethyl derivatives of the ring I vinyl moiety of heme. The absorption spectra of the protein-bound adducts in both the oxidized and reduced states were highly similar to those described for hemichromes, which are thought to be involved in the formation of Heinz bodies and subsequent red cell lysis."
https://openalex.org/W1529192632,"Recently, we have reported that the isolated guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein, Gh, couples to the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor (Im, M.-J., and Graham, R. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18944-18951 and Im, M.-J., Riek, R.P., and Graham, R. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18952-18960) and has a molecular mass of approximately 74 kDa, and the approximately 50-kDa protein which is copurified probably regulates guanine nucleotide binding of the 74-kDa GTP-binding protein. In this paper, we describe the role of purified Gh in the regulation of phospholipase C in the reconstitution system. The stimulation of phospholipase C activity by Gh effectively occurred at a low calcium concentration (less than or equal to 2 microM), but the phospholipase C (PLC) itself required at least 50-100 times more calcium to become fully activated. The characteristic nature of phospholipase C stimulation by Gh is its response to the calcium concentration. Thus, the enzyme activity changes in narrow submicromolar ranges and reaches maximal stimulation, but it does not extend to the levels above those stimulated by calcium alone. The calcium concentrations for the maximal stimulation of phospholipase C activity were 10-20 microM with phospholipid vesicles and 100-200 microM with detergent solution. These calcium concentrations were further decreased when Gh and phospholipase C were co-reconstituted into the phospholipid vesicles or in the detergent solution. The maximal stimulations of the PLC activity were reached at less than 5 microM calcium in both the vesicles and the detergent solution. The changes of calcium concentration for the activation of PLC are quite different from those obtained by reconstituting PLC-beta 1 with Gq-like G-proteins (Smarcka, A. V., Hepler, J. R., Brown, K. O., and Sternweis, P. C. (1991) Science 251, 804-807 and Taylor, S. J., Chae, H. Z., Rhee, S. G., and Exton, J. H. (1991) Nature 350, 516-518). The phospholipase C activity was stimulated in a Gh concentration-dependent manner in the presence of GTP gamma S. The phospholipase C activity was activated by Gh alpha in the presence of aluminum fluoride, but not by Gh beta. Furthermore, a Gh.PLC complex can be induced by incubation with aluminum fluoride in a detergent solution and partially purified without the dissociation of related proteins. Thus, our reconstitution studies show that the pattern of stimulation of PLC by AIF-4-activated Gh in the ternary complex is similar to the stimulation of PLC activated by Gh in both detergent solution and phospholipid vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1559206117,"The binding of Artocarpus integrifolia lectin (jacalin) to 4-methylumbelliferyl (Meumb)-glycosides, Gal alpha Meumb, Gal beta Meumb, GalNAc alpha Meumb, GalNAc beta-Meumb, and Gal beta 3GalNAc beta Meumb was examined by extrinsic fluorescence quenching titration and stopped flow spectrofluorimetry. The binding was characterized by 100% quenching of fluorescence of Meumb-glycosides. Their association constants range from 2.0 x 10(4) to 1.58 x 10(6) M-1 at 15 degrees C. Entropic contribution is the major stabilizing force for avid binding of Meumb-glycosides indicating the existence of a hydrophobic site that is complementary to their methylumbelliferyl group. The second order association rate constants for interaction of these sugars with lectin at 15 degrees C vary from 8.8 x 10(5) to 3.24 x 10(6) M-1 S-1, at pH 7.2. The first order dissociation rate constants range from 2.30 to 43.0 S-1 at 15 degrees C. Despite the differences in their association rate constants, the overall values of association constants for these saccharides are determined by their dissociation rate constants. The second order rate constant for the association of Meumb-glycosides follows a pattern consistent with the magnitude of the activation energies involved therin. Activation parameters for association of all ligands illustrate that the origin of the barrier between binding of jacalin to Meumb-glycosides is entropic, and the enthalpic contribution is small. A correlation between these parameters and the structure of the ligands on the association rates underscores the importance of steric factors in determining protein saccharide recognitions."
https://openalex.org/W1524629322,"The affinity of synthetic P22 operators for P22 repressor varies with the base sequence at the operator's center. At 100 mM KCl, the affinity of these operators for P22 repressor varies over a 10-fold range. Dimethylsulfate protection experiments indicate that the central bases of the P22 operator are not contacted by the repressor. The KD for the complex of P22 repressor with an operator bearing central T-A bases (9T) increases less than 2-fold between 50 and 200 mM KCl, whereas the KD for the complex of repressor with an operator bearing central C-G bases (9C) increases 10-fold in the same salt range. The DNase I cleavage patterns of both bound and unbound P22 operators also vary with central base sequence. The DNase I pattern of the repressor-9C operator complex changes markedly with salt concentration, whereas that of the 9T operator-repressor complex does not. These changes in nuclease digestion pattern thereby mirror the salt-dependent changes in the P22 operator's affinity for repressor. P22 repressor protects the central base pair of the 9T operator from cleavage by the intercalative cleavage reagent Cu(I)-phenanthroline, while repressor does not protect the central bases of the 9C operator. Together these data indicate that central base pairs affect P22 operator strength by altering the structure of the unbound operator and the repressor-operator complex."
https://openalex.org/W1551458828,"To investigate abnormal growth regulation in keloid fibroblasts, responses to phorbol esters were examined. Treatment of quiescent cultures with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) blocked a normally occurring (20-24 h) peak of serum-stimulated thymidine incorporation in normal and keloid cells. In keloid fibroblasts PMA induced a delayed peak of DNA synthesis. When indomethacin was added with PMA the delayed peak appeared in normal fibroblasts. The ED50 for inhibition of the 20-24-h peak was 1 nM, whereas the delayed peak required a 50-fold-higher PMA concentration. In both cell types PMA induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis, and exogenous PGE2 caused 50% inhibition of the 20-24-h peak. When PMA and indomethacin were added with PGE2 the delayed peak was inhibited 90% in normal fibroblasts, whereas inhibition of keloid cells was the same as with PGE2 alone. Normal and keloid fibroblasts had the same number of phorbol ester binding sites. However, in normal cells, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate bound with greater affinity, and down-regulation of phorbol ester binding occurred to a greater extent. These findings suggest that altered expression of protein kinase C isozymes or another molecule that binds phorbol esters may play a role in abnormal growth regulation of keloid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1606814244,"Maximal rates of O2 uptake by hepatocytes from hypothyroid, euthyroid, and hyperthyroid rats, in the absence of uncoupling agents or ionophores, were achieved by simultaneously stimulating ureogenesis and gluconeogenesis. Rates were increased by pretreatment of the donor animals with thyroid hormone. Only a minor part of the increase could be attributed to stimulation of the activity of plasma membrane (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. No synthesis of glycogen occurred, nor was there any evidence of pyruvate cycling under the conditions used, thus ruling out these processes as potential sources of ATP turnover. Calculation of the O2 uptake necessary to satisfy the energy requirements of gluconeogenesis and ureogenesis, based on anticipated ATP demand and an assumed P:O ratio of 3:1, invariably yielded a theoretical quantity that was less than the experimentally measured increase in O2 uptake. The difference between measured and calculated rates of respiration, possibly representing noncoupled respiration, was related to the thyroid status of the animal, being greatest in cells from hyperthyroid rats. In another experimental approach the O2 uptake associated with ATP synthesis was inhibited by the addition of oligomycin to hepatocytes incubated in the presence of substrates, thus abolishing ATP-coupled respiration. The magnitude of the ATP-coupled as well as the residual respiration was increased in response to thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone increased the turnover of intramitochondrial ATP. These results imply that a considerable portion of the thermogenic effect of thyroid hormone may be mediated by a stimulatory action on metabolism not directly associated with extramitochondrial ATP-dependent synthetic processes."

When 16 amino acid residues were deleted from the C-terminal end, the beta-galactosidase polypeptide was also observed in the nuclei but it was degraded rapidly, with a half-life of 1.6 h. When the nuclear localizing signal was replaced with a mutant sequence, which lacks nuclear targeting activity, the beta-galactosidase polypeptides were present throughout the cells rather than in the nuclei. The beta-galactosidase polypeptide with the complete C terminus was stable and the cytoplasmic truncated polypeptide was degraded at the same rate as the nuclear C terminus truncated polypeptide. The beta-galactosidase polypeptides with the complete C terminus were present as a tetramer as reported previously and had beta-galactosidase activity, but the C terminus truncated polypeptides were present as monomer and had no enzyme activity, indicating that C terminus truncated beta-galactosidase is malfolded. Together, the results suggest that a nuclear-localized malfolded protein is degraded as rapidly as a cytoplasmic malfolded protein."
https://openalex.org/W1543090471,"Glc3Man9(GlcNAc)2-pyrophosphoryl-dolichol is the major lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) produced by Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in culture. However, when these cells are incubated in the presence of millimolar concentrations of mannosamine and labeled with [2-3H]mannose, they accumulate various LLO that have smaller-sized oligosaccharides with unusual structures and the Glc3Man9(GlcNAc)2-pyrophosphoryl-dolichol is not detected. Thus in the presence of 10 mM mannosamine, more than 80% of the oligosaccharides are eluted from concanavalin A-Sepharose with 10 mM alpha-methylglucoside, indicating that they no longer have the tight-binding characteristics of control oligosaccharides. In addition, 20-40% of these oligosaccharides bind to Dowex 50-H+, indicating the presence of mannosamine in these structures. Interestingly enough, these abnormal oligosaccharides are still transferred to protein. The mannosamine-induced oligosaccharides were separated into neutral and basic fractions on a cation exchange resin. The neutral oligosaccharides ranged in size from hexose3(GlcNAc)2 to hexose10(GlcNAc)2 with the major species being Man5(GlcNAc)2 to Man7(GlcNAc)2. These oligosaccharides were almost completely susceptible to digestion by alpha-mannosidase and by endoglucosaminidase H. The basic oligosaccharides showed anomolous behavior on the Bio-Gel P-4 columns and appeared to be of small size on the standard columns, ranging from hexose2 to hexose4. However, most of these oligosaccharides were susceptible to digestion by endoglucosaminidase H as well as by alpha-mannosidase, suggesting that they were of different size and structure than would be predicted from the gel filtration patterns. Significantly, when the basic oligosaccharides were subjected to chemical N-acetylation, or when the gel filtration columns were run at high pH rather than at the usual pH of 3.0, the basic oligosaccharides migrated like much larger oligosaccharides. These data provide strong evidence to indicate that some mannosamine can be incorporated into the LLO, and that these mannosamine-containing oligosaccharides exhibit unusual properties. Preliminary studies indicated that Madin-Darby canine kidney cells do incorporate label from [3H]mannosamine into the LLO."
https://openalex.org/W1574669272,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) of Torpedo electric organ and vertebrate skeletal muscle is closely associated with a Mr 43,000 protein (43K). In this study, we have examined the effects on the AChR of treatments which remove the 43K protein. We used semiquantitative fluorescence techniques to measure the binding of antibodies to clustered AChR in cultured rat myotubes. We found that labeling by antibodies to the cytoplasmic portions of each of the four receptor polypeptides increased significantly upon extraction of the 43K protein. Labeling by an antibody to an extracellular epitope of the alpha subunits was not affected by removal of the 43K protein, suggesting that changes were restricted to the cytoplasmic domains of the AChR. Increases in labeling by antibodies were more limited following protease treatment, which removes most cytoskeletal structures but leaves the 43K protein bound to the membrane. Competition between an antibody to the beta subunit and an antibody to the gamma and delta subunits suggests that the cytoplasmic portion of the AChR still retains a degree of native structure in the absence of the 43K protein. Our results suggest that, although some of these changes may be due to simply exposing additional epitopes on the AChR, the cytoplasmic portions of all the subunits of the AChR undergo significant conformational changes upon extraction of the 43K protein."
https://openalex.org/W1945819998,"Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is a lysosomal storage disease due to mutations in the aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA) gene. The deficient enzyme activity in patients' cells blocks one of the final steps in the degradation of N-linked glycoproteins. All the AGU mutations identified so far affect the coding region of the AGA gene. Here we report a homozygous 876-base pair deletion, which removes the 3'-noncoding area but leaves the coding region of the AGA mRNA intact. This deletion does not prevent transcription termination or polyadenylation of the patient's truncated mRNA, and the steady state level of the mRNA is comparable with the control. However, the quantity of AGA polypeptide chains in the patient's fibroblasts is negligible. This suggests that the deletion interferes with the translational efficiency in vivo and provides a unique model to pursue the biological significance of untranslated regions of human mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1567885824,"Abstract The strongly conserved single tryptophan residue, Trp92, in Bacillus subtilis tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase has been mutagenized via site direction singly into Gln, Ala, and Phe. All three mutant enzymes were inactive toward the catalysis of tRNA tryptophanylation. The Trp92----Phe mutant has been subcloned into the high expression plasmid pKK223-3 to yield the recombinant plasmid pKSW-F92. Growth of bacteria carrying the latter plasmid made possible the purification of the mutant TrpRS-F92 enzyme to homogeneity. This mutant enzyme was deficient in ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence relative to the wild type enzyme and inactive in the partial reaction of Trp-activation as well as the overall reaction of tRNA tryptophanylation. Furthermore, unlike the wild type B. subtilis trpS gene, the mutant trpS-F92 gene upon transformation into Escherichia coli trpS 10343 failed to complement the temperature sensitive trpS mutation of the host cells. Trp92 therefore represents an essential residue both in vitro and in vivo for the function of the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase."
