https://openalex.org/W3036500399,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for physiological models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection using human disease-relevant cells. COVID-19 pathophysiology includes respiratory failure but involves other organ systems including gut, liver, heart, and pancreas. We present an experimental platform comprised of cell and organoid derivatives from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). A Spike-enabled pseudo-entry virus infects pancreatic endocrine cells, liver organoids, cardiomyocytes, and dopaminergic neurons. Recent clinical studies show a strong association with COVID-19 and diabetes. We find that human pancreatic beta cells and liver organoids are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, further validated using adult primary human islets and adult hepatocyte and cholangiocyte organoids. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused striking expression of chemokines, as also seen in primary human COVID-19 pulmonary autopsy samples. hPSC-derived cells/organoids provide valuable models for understanding the cellular responses of human tissues to SARS-CoV-2 infection and for disease modeling of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3037848912,"As of 10 April 2020, New York State had 180,458 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 9,385 reported deaths. Patients with cancer comprised 8.4% of deceased individuals1. Population-based studies from China and Italy suggested a higher coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) death rate in patients with cancer2,3, although there is a knowledge gap as to which aspects of cancer and its treatment confer risk of severe COVID-194. This information is critical to balance the competing safety considerations of reducing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and cancer treatment continuation. From 10 March to 7 April 2020, 423 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were diagnosed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (from a total of 2,035 patients with cancer tested). Of these, 40% were hospitalized for COVID-19, 20% developed severe respiratory illness (including 9% who required mechanical ventilation) and 12% died within 30 d. Age older than 65 years and treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were predictors for hospitalization and severe disease, whereas receipt of chemotherapy and major surgery were not. Overall, COVID-19 in patients with cancer is marked by substantial rates of hospitalization and severe outcomes. The association observed between ICI and COVID-19 outcomes in our study will need further interrogation in tumor-specific cohorts. Analysis of a large, single-center cohort of patients with cancer who were infected with COVID-19 uncovers factors associated with disease severity and interactions with anti-cancer therapies"

Small molecule drugs binding to their targets in covalent mode, although historically being intentionally avoided by pharmaceutical researchers and industry, have resurged with great success in recent years (Singh et al., 2011Singh J.

Rev. 2018; 47: 3816-3830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Covalent bonding between drug and target offer multiple desirable features over noncovalent interactions of conventional drugs, including increased biochemical efficiency and potency, prolonged duration of action outlasting the drug pharmacokinetics, improved therapeutic index with reduced dosage and dosing frequency, complete inactivation of target, and opportunity to inhibit intractable targets (Johnson et al., 2010Johnson D.S.

Rev. 2018; 47: 3816-3830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, almost 30% of the marketed drugs targeting enzymes act via a covalent mechanism, and targeted covalent inhibition is increasingly applied to a broader range of targets that are challenging with noncovalent drugs (Robertson, 2005Robertson J.G. Mechanistic basis of enzyme-targeted drugs.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5561-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, Johnson et al., 2010Johnson D.S. Weerapana E. Cravatt B.F. Strategies for discovering and derisking covalent, irreversible enzyme inhibitors.Future Med. Chem. 2010; 2: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast to the blossoming of small molecule covalent drugs, the therapeutic potential of covalent protein drugs remains largely untapped. This gap is due to an inherent limitation of natural proteins: they interact mainly through noncovalent interactions and lack the covalent reactivity toward natural amino acid residues of targets. In addition, the ubiquitous presence of amino acids in proteins, cells, and in vivo imposes a huge challenge to achieve reaction selectivity toward the protein target. The key to develop covalent small molecule drugs has been to strike the right balance between reactivity and selectivity (Johnson et al., 2010Johnson D.S. Weerapana E. Cravatt B.F. Strategies for discovering and derisking covalent, irreversible enzyme inhibitors.Future Med. Chem. 2010; 2: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We reason that protein drugs would be particularly suitable for covalent mode of action. A major concern for small molecule covalent drugs is off-target reactivity (Singh et al., 2011Singh J. Petter R.C. Baillie T.A. Whitty A. The resurgence of covalent drugs.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011; 10: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar), which can be minimized in covalent protein drugs, because proteins have larger space for selective warhead introduction and generally higher specificity for targets than small molecules. To enable the generation of covalent protein drugs for in vivo usage, we need a novel strategy to engineer into proteins chemical reactivity that is biocompatible and highly specific for the target. Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) is a transmembrane receptor modulating the activity of T cells. PD-L1 is a ligand of PD-1 and often overexpressed in different tumors (Dong et al., 1999Dong H. Zhu G. Tamada K. Chen L. B7-H1, a third member of the B7 family, co-stimulates T-cell proliferation and interleukin-10 secretion.Nat.

Immunol. 2007; 19: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The PD-1/PD-L1 interaction inhibits T-lymphocyte proliferation, release of cytokines, and cytotoxicity, resulting in exhaustion and apoptosis of tumor-specific T cells (Francisco et al., 2010Francisco L.M. Sage P.T. Sharpe A.H. The PD-1 pathway in tolerance and autoimmunity.Immunol. Rev. 2010; 236: 219-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, Sharpe and Pauken, 2018Sharpe A.H. Pauken K.E.

Therefore, the blockage of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction can reverse the dampened antitumor immune response, and several monoclonal antibodies have been developed to target the PD-1/PD-L1 axis for treating cancer (Sharma and Allison, 2015Sharma P.

However, antibodies have inherent limitations including poor tissue/tumor penetrance and adverse Fc-effector functions that deplete immune cells and induce tissue damage, and patient response to existing PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies varies (Lee and Tannock, 2010Lee C.M.

Alternative non-antibody therapeutics with smaller molecular weights are thus being actively sought (Li et al., 2018aLi C. Zhang N. Zhou J. Ding C. Jin Y. Cui X. Pu K. Zhu Y.

For instance, the ectodomain of PD-1 has been engineered to possess high affinity for PD-L1 and used as competitive antagonist of PD-L1 (Maute et al., 2015Maute R.L. Gordon S.R. Mayer A.T. McCracken M.N. Natarajan A. Ring N.G. Kimura R. Tsai J.M. Manglik A. Kruse A.C. et al.Engineering high-affinity PD-1 variants for optimized immunotherapy and immuno-PET imaging.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nonetheless, these high-affinity PD-1 antagonists showed mixed success in syngeneic mouse models only, and required the extra appendage of Ig domains for in vivo half-life and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, it would be desirable to generate a covalent linkage between PD-1 and PD-L1, creating an irreversible antagonist possessing infinite affinity that is unreachable with any high-affinity mutants evolved through natural amino acid mutagenesis. Here, we report a proximity-enabled reactive therapeutics (PERx) strategy to develop covalent protein drugs (Figure 1A). Through the expansion of the genetic code (Wang et al., 2001Wang L. Brock A. Herberich B. Schultz P.G. Expanding the genetic code of Escherichia coli.Science. 2001; 292: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, Wang and Schultz, 2004Wang L. Schultz P.G. Expanding the genetic code.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 44: 34-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, Wang, 2017aWang L. Engineering the Genetic Code in Cells and Animals: Biological Considerations and Impacts.Acc. Chem. Res. 2017; 50: 2767-2775Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we introduce into the protein drug a latent bioreactive unnatural amino acid (Uaa), which has latent chemical reactivity and remains inert inside the protein and in vivo. Upon binding of the protein drug to its target, the bioreactive Uaa is brought into close proximity to a natural residue of the target, which promotes the Uaa to react with the natural residue selectively due to proximity-enabled reactivity (Xiang et al., 2013Xiang Z. Ren H. Hu Y.S. Coin I. Wei J. Cang H. Wang L. Adding an unnatural covalent bond to proteins through proximity-enhanced bioreactivity.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), thus forming a covalent linkage between the drug and the target specifically. To demonstrate PERx, we genetically incorporated the latent bioreactive Uaa, fluorosulfate-L-tyrosine (FSY) (Wang et al., 2018Wang N. Yang B. Fu C. Zhu H. Zheng F. Kobayashi T. Liu J. Li S. Ma C. Wang P.G. et al.Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140: 4995-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), into the ectodomain of human PD-1, and showed that the resultant PD-1(FSY) covalently bound to only its natural ligand PD-L1 in vitro, on cancer cell surface, and in tumor in vivo. Compared with PD-1(WT), PD-1(FSY) significantly enhanced the functional activities of human native T cells and engineered chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells and inhibited tumor growth in several immune-humanized mouse models with strikingly higher efficacy, showing anti-tumor effect equivalent or superior to that of a therapeutic anti-PD-L1 antibody, thus highlighting the robust therapeutic efficacy of covalent protein drugs enabled by PERx over conventional noncovalent protein drugs. We further demonstrated the covalent targeting of the HER2 receptor on breast cancer cells using affibody via PERx. We expect that the PERx strategy can be generally applied to native protein-protein interactions as well as engineered protein binders for developing covalent protein drugs, allowing the potential of this unique therapeutic mechanism to be fully exploited on proteins. We previously demonstrated that latent bioreactive Uaas can be genetically incorporated into proteins via the expansion of the genetic code (Xiang et al., 2013Xiang Z. Ren H. Hu Y.S. Coin I. Wei J. Cang H. Wang L. Adding an unnatural covalent bond to proteins through proximity-enhanced bioreactivity.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These latent bioreactive Uaas are chemically stable in proteins and in cells, but are able to selectively react with a target natural amino acid residue when the Uaa and target natural residue are brought into close proximity (Xiang et al., 2013Xiang Z. Ren H. Hu Y.S. Coin I. Wei J. Cang H. Wang L. Adding an unnatural covalent bond to proteins through proximity-enhanced bioreactivity.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Coin et al., 2013Coin I. Katritch V. Sun T. Xiang Z. Siu F.Y. Beyermann M. Stevens R.C. Wang L.

Genetically encoding new bioreactivity.N. Biotechnol. 2017; 38: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In particular, we genetically encoded the latent bioreactive Uaa FSY (Wang et al., 2018Wang N. Yang B. Fu C. Zhu H. Zheng F. Kobayashi T. Liu J. Li S. Ma C. Wang P.G. et al.Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140: 4995-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which is nontoxic to mammalian cells, remains inert in proteins inside cells, and is able to react with residues Tyr, His, or Lys in proximity via click chemistry sulfur-fluoride exchange (SuFEx), generating stable linkages resistant to hydrolysis (Figure 1B; Dong et al., 2014Dong J. Krasnova L. Finn M.G. Sharpless K.B. Sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx): another good reaction for click chemistry.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2014; 53: 9430-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The released fluoride ion is found in fluoridated salt, milk, and toothpaste and is excreted through kidneys (Kanduti et al., 2016Kanduti D. Sterbenk P. Artnik B. Fluoride: a Review of Use and Effects on Health.Mater. Sociomed. 2016; 28: 133-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that introduction of latent bioreactive Uaas into a protein drug at or near the binding interface would enable the Uaa to selectively react with a natural residue of the target protein in response to drug-target binding, allowing the protein drug to covalently bind to its target with high specificity (Figure 1A). The PD-1/PD-L1 immunologic checkpoint was chosen to test the idea: incorporation of a latent bioreactive Uaa into PD-1 would convert PD-1 into a covalent protein drug to block the endogenous PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. On the basis of the crystal structure of human PD-1/PD-L1 complex (Zak et al., 2015Zak K.M. Kitel R. Przetocka S. Golik P. Guzik K. Musielak B. Dömling A. Dubin G. Holak T.A. Structure of the Complex of Human Programmed Death 1, PD-1, and Its Ligand PD-L1.Structure. 2015; 23: 2341-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), we decided to incorporate FSY at Gln75, Asp77, or Ala129 of PD-1 separately, targeting Lys124, Lys124, and His69 of PD-L1, respectively (Figure 1C). FSY was incorporated into the ectodomain of human PD-1 by expressing in E. coli the gene for PD-1 IgV domain with the amber stop codon (TAG) introduced at the desired site, together with the genes for the orthogonal tRNAPyl/FSYRS pair, which incorporates FSY in response to the TAG codon (Wang et al., 2018Wang N. Yang B. Fu C. Zhu H. Zheng F. Kobayashi T. Liu J. Li S. Ma C. Wang P.G. et al.Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140: 4995-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). PD-1 mutant proteins were affinity purified (yielding 3.6 mg/L) and refolded (yielding 1.7 mg/L) (Figures 1D and S1A). Mass spectrometric analysis of the mutant protein confirmed that FSY was incorporated into PD-1 at the TAG-specified position in high fidelity (Figure 1E). To test if FSY-incorporated PD-1 ectodomain mutants could bind to human PD-L1 covalently in vitro, we incubated these mutant proteins with PD-L1 protein under mild conditions, followed by SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses (Figure 2A). The ectodomain of wild-type human PD-1, referred to as PD-1(WT) hereafter, was purified and included as a control. Although PD-1(WT) and PD-1(77FSY) did not form a covalent complex with PD-L1 under the denatured analysis conditions, a stable covalent complex of PD-1/PD-L1 was detected for PD-1(75FSY) and PD-1(129FSY), with PD-1(129FSY) showing higher covalent crosslinking efficiency (43% ± 4%) than PD-1(75FSY) (16% ± 2%). PD-1(129FSY) crosslinked with PD-L1 with an apparent second-order rate constant of 886 ± 53 M−1 min−1 (Figures S1B and S1C). PD-1(129FSY) was thus used in subsequent experiments and hereafter referred to as PD-1(FSY) for clarity. To verify if PD-1(FSY) covalently targeted the proximal His69 of human PD-L1 as designed, we mutated His69 to Ala and found that the resultant PD-L1(H69A) did not form covalent complex with PD-1(FSY) (Figure 2B). In addition, we analyzed the incubation product of PD-1(FSY) with PD-L1 using high-resolution mass spectrometry. In the tandem mass spectrum, two series of b and y ions of the crosslinked peptides unambiguously indicated that FSY of PD-1(FSY) specifically reacted with His69 of PD-L1 (Figure 2C). We next tested whether PD-1(FSY) could covalently bind to human PD-L1 physiologically expressed on live cancer cell surface. PD-1(FSY) was incubated with H460 cells (a human large cell lung cancer cell line) or U87 cells (a human primary glioblastoma cell line), which both express PD-L1 on cell surface. After incubation, cells were lysed and the lysate analyzed with western blot (Figure 2D). PD-1(WT) did not crosslink with PD-L1, whereas PD-1(FSY) covalently crosslinked with the endogenous full-length PD-L1 on both lines of cancer cells, and the crosslinking efficiency increased with the concentration of PD-1(FSY) applied. We further tested whether PD-1(FSY) could covalently crosslink with human PD-L1 in tumor tissue in vivo. We engrafted the immunodeficient NSG mice with H460 or U87 cells to form solid tumors. When the tumor size reached 4 × 4 mm2, PD-1(WT) or PD-1(FSY) was delivered via tail intravenous injection or peri-tumoral injection. After 3 h, the tumors were dissected for immunoblotting of PD-L1. PD-1(WT) again did not yield any crosslinking with PD-L1, whereas PD-1(FSY) showed apparent covalent crosslinking with PD-L1 in both types of tumor and through both injection methods, with the crosslinking efficiency increased with the doses of PD-1(FSY) injected (Figure 2E). Human PD-L1(H69A) abolished the covalent binding of human PD-1(FSY), indicating that human PD-1(FSY) covalently targeted human PD-L1 with high residue specificity. Human PD-1 is known to cross-bind to mouse PD-L1 (Lázár-Molnár et al., 2017Lázár-Molnár E. Scandiuzzi L. Basu I. Quinn T. Sylvestre E. Palmieri E. Ramagopal U.A. Nathenson S.G. Guha C. Almo S.C. Structure-guided development of a high-affinity human Programmed Cell Death-1: Implications for tumor immunotherapy.EBioMedicine. 2017; 17: 30-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To evaluate the covalent targeting specificity of human PD-1(FSY) toward other proteins, we tested if human PD-1(FSY) could covalently bind to mouse PD-L1 on mouse cell surface. Immune cells from mouse thymus and spleen were dissociated and incubated with human PD-1(WT) and PD-1(FSY), followed with similar analysis. No covalent crosslinking of human PD-1(WT) or PD-1(FSY) with mouse PD-L1 was detected (Figure S2A). Homology alignment of human and mouse PD-L1 sequences indicates that the target His69 of human PD-L1 corresponds to Ala69 of mouse PD-L1 (Figure S2B; Tan et al., 2016Tan S. Chen D. Liu K. He M. Song H. Shi Y. Liu J. Zhang C.W.H. Qi J. Yan J. et al.Crystal clear: visualizing the intervention mechanism of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by two cancer therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.Protein Cell. 2016; 7: 866-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which cannot react with FSY (Wang et al., 2018Wang N. Yang B. Fu C. Zhu H. Zheng F. Kobayashi T. Liu J. Li S. Ma C. Wang P.G. et al.Genetically Encoding Fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine To React with Lysine, Histidine, and Tyrosine via SuFEx in Proteins in Vivo.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140: 4995-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This residue selectivity of PERx thus achieves high target specificity, allowing human PD-1(FSY) to distinguish human PD-L1 from mouse PD-L1 for covalent targeting. In addition, to evaluate if there was any off-target covalent crosslinking of human PD-1(FSY) to other proteins of cancer cells and tumor in vivo, we analyzed the human PD-1(FSY) treated cancer cells and tumors with western blot using anti-human PD-1 antibody (Figures S2C–S2E). No other proteins were detected to covalently bind to human PD-1(FSY), indicating that human PD-1(FSY) covalently targeted human PD-L1 on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in a specific manner. Taken together, human PD-1(FSY) covalently bound to human PD-L1 through FSY129 of PD-1 reacting with His69 of PD-L1. The covalent binding can be achieved efficiently and specifically with purified target proteins, target proteins expressed on cultured cancer cells in vitro, and target proteins expressed in tumor tissues in vivo. To examine if the covalent binding ability of PD-1(FSY) could enhance T cell activation by blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, we performed an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) in vitro. Dendritic cells express PD-L1, which interacts with PD-1 expressed on T cells to restrict T cell proliferation and activation. Mature dendritic cells were derived from monocytes isolated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors, with PD-L1 expression confirmed by flow cytometry (Figure S3). The mature dendritic cells were separately treated with PD-1(WT), PD-1(FSY), or atezolizumab (a Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved cancer treating monoclonal antibody against human PD-L1) (Akinleye and Rasool, 2019Akinleye A.

After co-culturing for 5 days, CFSE-positive CD3+ T cells were analyzed with flow cytometry (Figure 3A). As shown in the PBS control, co-culturing with allogeneic dendritic cells increased T cell proliferation, indicated by the increase of CFSE positive cells with CFSE intensity lower than the parental population (CFSElow) (Figure 3B). In comparison with the PBS control, PD-1(WT) did not increase T cell proliferation at concentrations from 50 to 250 nM. In contrast, PD-1(FSY) elicited a significant enhancement of T cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The T cell activation effect of PD-1(FSY) was comparable to that of atezolizumab applied at the same molar concentrations.Figure 3PD-1(FSY) Increased T Cell Proliferation and IFN-γ Production In Vitro after Allogeneic Stimulation by Dendritic CellsShow full caption(A) Flow cytometric traces of the CFSE stain intensity of CD3+ T cells after co-culturing with dendritic cells that were treated with indicated proteins.

See also Figure S3. In addition, the level of interferon γ (IFN-γ) released by T cells in the co-culture was measured to indicate T cell activation (Figure 3C). In comparison with the PBS control, PD-1(WT) did not significantly increase IFN-γ production at the concentration of 50 and 250 nM. In contrast, PD-1(FSY) elicited a marked increase of IFN-γ production (3.4-fold) at 50 nM, and a further increase to 4.1-fold at 250 nM. The effect on IFN-γ production of PD-1(FSY) was again comparable to that of atezolizumab. Therefore, similarly to atezolizumab, PD-1(FSY) could significantly enhance T cell activation induced by allogeneic dendritic cells through blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, whereas PD-1(WT) could not. Given the ability of PD-1(FSY) to bind PD-L1 irreversibly and to promote T cell activation in vitro, we sought to evaluate its antitumor activity in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W3037816506,"Formation of the body of vertebrate embryos proceeds sequentially by posterior addition of tissues from the tail bud. Cells of the tail bud and the posterior presomitic mesoderm, which control posterior elongation1, exhibit a high level of aerobic glycolysis that is reminiscent of the metabolic status of cancer cells experiencing the Warburg effect2,3. Glycolytic activity downstream of fibroblast growth factor controls WNT signalling in the tail bud3. In the neuromesodermal precursors of the tail bud4, WNT signalling promotes the mesodermal fate that is required for sustained axial elongation, at the expense of the neural fate3,5. How glycolysis regulates WNT signalling in the tail bud is currently unknown. Here we used chicken embryos and human tail bud-like cells differentiated in vitro from induced pluripotent stem cells to show that these cells exhibit an inverted pH gradient, with the extracellular pH lower than the intracellular pH, as observed in cancer cells6. Our data suggest that glycolysis increases extrusion of lactate coupled to protons via the monocarboxylate symporters. This contributes to elevating the intracellular pH in these cells, which creates a favourable chemical environment for non-enzymatic β-catenin acetylation downstream of WNT signalling. As acetylated β-catenin promotes mesodermal rather than neural fate7, this ultimately leads to activation of mesodermal transcriptional WNT targets and specification of the paraxial mesoderm in tail bud precursors. Our work supports the notion that some tumour cells reactivate a developmental metabolic programme. The authors show that metabolic activity leads to an increase in the intracellular pH of neuromesodermal precursors, and that this increase in pH, by allowing post-translational modification of β-catenin, is required for the activation of WNT signalling and mesodermal fate acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W3037829040,"Stimulation of the metabotropic GABAB receptor by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) results in prolonged inhibition of neurotransmission, which is central to brain physiology1. GABAB belongs to family C of the G-protein-coupled receptors, which operate as dimers to transform synaptic neurotransmitter signals into a cellular response through the binding and activation of heterotrimeric G proteins2,3. However, GABAB is unique in its function as an obligate heterodimer in which agonist binding and G-protein activation take place on distinct subunits4,5. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of heterodimeric and homodimeric full-length GABAB receptors. Complemented by cellular signalling assays and atomistic simulations, these structures reveal that extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) of GABAB has an essential role in relaying structural transitions by ordering the linker that connects the extracellular ligand-binding domain to the transmembrane region. Furthermore, the ECL2 of each of the subunits of GABAB caps and interacts with the hydrophilic head of a phospholipid that occupies the extracellular half of the transmembrane domain, thereby providing a potentially crucial link between ligand binding and the receptor core that engages G proteins. These results provide a starting framework through which to decipher the mechanistic modes of signal transduction mediated by GABAB dimers, and have important implications for rational drug design that targets these receptors. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of heterodimeric and homodimeric full-length GABAB receptors, combined with cellular signalling assays, shed light on the mechanisms that underpin signal transduction mediated by these receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3037155407,"Molecular noise is a natural phenomenon that is inherent to all biological systems1,2. How stochastic processes give rise to the robust outcomes that support tissue homeostasis remains unclear. Here we use single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) on mouse stem cells derived from haematopoietic tissue to measure the transcription dynamics of three key genes that encode transcription factors: PU.1 (also known as Spi1), Gata1 and Gata2. We find that infrequent, stochastic bursts of transcription result in the co-expression of these antagonistic transcription factors in the majority of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Moreover, by pairing smFISH with time-lapse microscopy and the analysis of pedigrees, we find that although individual stem-cell clones produce descendants that are in transcriptionally related states-akin to a transcriptional priming phenomenon-the underlying transition dynamics between states are best captured by stochastic and reversible models. As such, a stochastic process can produce cellular behaviours that may be incorrectly inferred to have arisen from deterministic dynamics. We propose a model whereby the intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression facilitates, rather than impedes, the concomitant maintenance of transcriptional plasticity and stem cell robustness."

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying microRNAs (miRs) may represent a useful tool in the development of therapies for DN. Here, we report that EVs released by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) during DN contain a microRNA, miR-26a-5p, that suppresses DN. Using bioinformatic analyses, we identified differentially expressed miRs in EVs from ADSCs and in DN and predicted downstream regulatory target genes. We isolated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from adipose tissues and collected EVs from the ADSCs. We exposed mouse glomerular podocytes and MP5 cells to high glucose (HG), ADSC-derived EVs, miR-26a-5p inhibitor/antagomir, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plasmids, or the NF-κB pathway activator (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, or PMA). We used the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry to investigate the impact of miR-26a-5p on cell viability and apoptosis and validated the results of these assays with in vivo experiments in nude mice. We found that in DN, miR-26a-5p is expressed at very low levels, whereas TLR4 is highly expressed. Of note, EVs from ADSCs ameliorated the pathological symptoms of DN in diabetic mice and transferred miR-26a-5p to HG-induced MP5 cells, improving viability while suppressing the apoptosis of MP5 cells. We also found that miR-26a-5p protects HG-induced MP5 cells from injury by targeting TLR4, inactivating the NF-κB pathway, and downregulating vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). Moreover, ADSC-derived EVs transferred miR-26a-5p to mouse glomerular podocytes, which ameliorated DN pathology. These findings suggest that miR-26a-5p from ADSC-derived EVs protects against DN.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a common microvascular complication of diabetes, is one of the major causes of death among patients with diabetes (1Wang X. Xu Y. Chu C. Li H. Mi J. Wen Z. Zhang S. Wang Q.

It is also the leading cause of both chronic kidney and end-stage renal diseases worldwide (2De la Cruz-Cano E. Jimenez-Gonzalez C.D.C. Morales-Garcia V. Pineda-Perez C. Tejas-Juarez J.G.

The incidence of DN is increasing in developing countries, including China (3Misra A. Shrivastava U. Obstructive sleep apnea and diabetic nephropathy.Diabetes Technol.

Moreover, the dysfunction of podocytes contributes to the development of DN (6Tung C.W. Hsu Y.C. Shih Y.H. Chang P.J. Lin C.L.

Wang Y. et al.Protein S protects against podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2018; 29 (29511111): 1397-141010.1681/ASN.2017030234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Current treatment methods for DN mainly rely on the management of hyperglycemia and blood pressure (8Wang Y. Wang C. Zhang X. Gu H.F. Wu L. Common drugs for stabilization of renal function in the progression of diabetic nephropathy and their relations with hypertension therapy.Curr. Diabetes Rev. 2018; 14 (28201968): 149-16110.2174/1573399813666170214112115Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) slow the development of DN by protecting podocytes from injury (9Duan Y.R. Chen B.P. Chen F. Yang S.X. Zhu C.Y. Ma Y.L. Li Y. Shi J.

Med. 2019; 10.1111/jcmm.14558Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Elucidating mechanisms by which EVs regulate podocyte injury may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of DN. EVs are nano-sized membrane vesicles that include exosomes and microvesicles, and they are released by many cells types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (10Gangadaran P. Ahn B.C. In vivo tracking of tumor-derived bioluminescent extracellular vesicles in mice.Methods Mol.

MSCs are multipotent stem cells that differentiate into a variety of lineages and exert important functions in bone regeneration and repair (12Yang Q. Jia L. Li X. Guo R. Huang Y. Zheng Y. Li W. Long noncoding RNAs: new players in the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow- and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.Stem Cell Rev. Rep. 2018; 14 (29464508): 297-30810.1007/s12015-018-9801-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A recent study highlighted the role of exosomes derived from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) in protecting against the development of DN (13Jin J. Shi Y. Gong J. Zhao L. Li Y. He Q. Huang H. Exosome secreted from adipose-derived stem cells attenuates diabetic nephropathy by promoting autophagy flux and inhibiting apoptosis in podocyte.Stem Cell Res. Ther. 2019; 10 (30876481): 9510.1186/s13287-019-1177-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). EVs are known to contain mRNA, microRNAs (miRs), and long noncoding RNAs, thereby transferring genetic information from one cell to the next (14Tetta C. Ghigo E. Silengo L. Deregibus M.C. Camussi G. Extracellular vesicles as an emerging mechanism of cell-to-cell communication.Endocrine. 2013; 44 (23203002): 11-1910.1007/s12020-012-9839-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interestingly, miR-26a-5p serves as a candidate biomarker for DN by a meta-analysis of profiling studies (15Gholaminejad A. Abdul Tehrani H. Gholami Fesharaki M. Identification of candidate microRNA biomarkers in diabetic nephropathy: a meta-analysis of profiling studies.J.

Loss of miR-26a led to the development of DN in both cultured podocytes and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (16Koga K. Yokoi H. Mori K. Kasahara M. Kuwabara T. Imamaki H. Ishii A. Mori K.P. Kato Y. Ohno S. Toda N. Saleem M.A. Sugawara A. Nakao K.

Additionally, miR-26a-5p was suggested to be one of the therapeutic mediators in DN (15Gholaminejad A. Abdul Tehrani H. Gholami Fesharaki M. Identification of candidate microRNA biomarkers in diabetic nephropathy: a meta-analysis of profiling studies.J.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which serves as a signaling receptor for lipopolysaccharides and as a crucial regulator of the innate immunity system, was identified as a downstream target gene of miR-26a-5p (17Kolz M. Baumert J. Muller M. Khuseyinova N. Klopp N. Thorand B. Meisinger C. Herder C. Koenig W. Illig T. Association between variations in the TLR4 gene and incident type 2 diabetes is modified by the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol.BMC Med. Genet. 2008; 9: 910.1186/1471-2350-9-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One study used M4200 cells to show that TLR4 also participates in the pathogenesis of DN (18Liu Z.M. Zheng H.Y. Chen L.H. Li Y.L. Wang Q. Liao C.F. Li X.W. Low expression of miR-203 promoted diabetic nephropathy via increasing TLR4.Eur. Rev. Med. Pharmacol. Sci. 2018; 22 (30229838): 5627-563410.26355/eurrev_201809_15828PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, downregulation of TLR/NF-κB (NF-κB) using umbelliferone ameliorated renal function in a rat model of DN (19Wang H.Q. Wang S.S. Chiufai K. Wang Q. Cheng X.L. Umbelliferone ameliorates renal function in diabetic nephropathy rats through regulating inflammation and TLR/NF-kappaB pathway.Chin. J. Nat. Med. 2019; 17 (31171269): 346-35410.1016/S1875-5364(19)30040-8PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the activation of NF-κB is thought to be related to the inflammation and disease development that are associated with DN (20Li M. Guo Q. Cai H. Wang H. Ma Z. Zhang X. miR-218 regulates diabetic nephropathy via targeting IKK-beta and modulating NK-kappaB-mediated inflammation.J. Cell. Physiol. 2020; 235: 3362-337110.1002/jcp.29224Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Upregulation of NF-κB by TLR4 was previously reported in rat pineal glands and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (21da Silveira Cruz-Machado S. Carvalho-Sousa C.E. Tamura E.K. Pinato L. Cecon E.

In addition, the NF-κB pathway could promote the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) (23Liang S. Chen Z. Jiang G. Zhou Y. Liu Q. Su Q. Wei W. Du J. Wang H. Activation of GPER suppresses migration and angiogenesis of triple negative breast cancer via inhibition of NF-kappaB/IL-6 signals.Cancer Lett. 2017; 386 (27836733): 12-2310.1016/j.canlet.2016.11.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which contributes to glomerular endothelial cell dysfunction as well as albuminuria in DN (24Onions K.L. Gamez M. Buckner N.R. Baker S.L. Betteridge K.B. Desideri S. Dallyn B.P. Ramnath R.D. Neal C.R. Farmer L.K. Mathieson P.W. Gnudi L. Alitalo K. Bates D.O. Salmon A.H.J. et al.VEGFC reduces glomerular albumin permeability and protects against alterations in VEGF receptor expression in diabetic nephropathy.Diabetes. 2019; 68 (30389746): 172-18710.2337/db18-0045Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Taking these findings into consideration, we hypothesized that ADSC-derived EVs transferred miR-26a-5p to other cells regulating the progression of DN by targeting TLR4 and modulating NF-κB and VEGFA. Thus, this study may help to identify a novel strategy for the control of DN. Analysis of the EVmiRNA database revealed that the expression of miR-26a-5p in the EVs derived from MSCs was significantly upregulated (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the miRanda database and Starbase database were used to predict the downstream target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs. These results were then compared with a diabetes-related gene expression data set (GSE21340). Five genes were identified at the intersection of these analyses (SMAD1, CELF2, SMAD6, PYGL, and TLR4) (Fig. 1B). Because the miRanda database predicted a binding site between miR-26a-5p and TLR4 (Fig. 1C), we chose to investigate the expression of TLR4 in the GSE21340 data set. We found that TLR4 expression was significantly higher in DN (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that miR-26a-5p delivered by ADSC-derived EVs protect against DN by regulating TLR4. ADSCs were isolated from the subcutaneous adipose tissues of C57BL/KsJ db/m mice. The surface markers associated with ADSCs were detected by flow cytometry after the third passage. ADSCs were positive for CD29 (96.7%), CD44 (95.2%), CD73 (99.1%), CD90 (98.4%), and HLA-A, -B, and -C (98.5%) but negative for CD14 (4.2%), CD19 (0.26%), CD34 (1.9%), CD45 (1.2%), and HLA-DR (0.89%) (Fig. 2A). The pluripotency of isolated ADSCs was tested. After isolation and culture, ADSCs could be differentiated into osteogenic, lipogenic, and chondrogenic cell types (Fig. 2B). The above results demonstrated that ADSCs isolated from adipose tissues had the property of pluripotent stem cell differentiation. Next, EVs isolated from medium used to grow ADSCs were characterized. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis indicated that EVs range in diameter from 30–150 nm. Transmission EM revealed the morphology of EVs to be cup-shaped or spherical. In addition, Western blot analysis of marker proteins of EVs confirmed the expression of CD63 and TSG101, whereas calnexin was absent, indicating that EVs had been successfully isolated (Fig. 2, C–E). The above results demonstrated the successful isolation of EVs from ADSCs. To evaluate the mouse model of spontaneous diabetes, we compared the levels of protein found in the urine (within 24 h), serum creatinine (Scr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in C57BL/KsJ db/db spontaneous diabetic mice and C57BL/KsJ db/m control mice. The spontaneously diabetic mice had twice the amount of urine protein and 3 times as much Scr and BUN as the control mice (Fig. 3, A–C). The histopathological phenotype was characterized by periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining of DN tissues. Spontaneously diabetic mice showed an accumulation of extracellular matrix in their kidney tissues, viability of mesangial cells, and a thickening of basement membrane. In addition, there was increased proteinuria in the lumen, hyaline degeneration, and severe vacuolar degeneration of renal tubular epithelial cells in these mice compared with that of control mice, indicating the successful establishment of the DN cell model (Fig. 3D). To investigate the effect of EVs from ADSCs on spontaneous diabetic mice, we injected ADSC-derived EVs or PBS into mice via the tail vein, and then changes of urine protein, Scr, and BUN levels were subsequently measured, followed by PAS staining to detect histopathological changes. The results illustrated that treatment with EVs derived from ADSCs notably reduced the levels of urine protein, Scr, and BUN in the DN mouse model and alleviated the histopathological changes associated with DN (Fig. 3, A–D). Next, TUNEL staining was used to detect the apoptosis of glomerular podocytes in mice. Glomerular podocytes from spontaneously diabetic mice (C57BL/KsJ db/db) exhibited a significant increase in apoptosis compared with control mice (C57BL/KsJ db/m mice), and this was reduced by injection of EVs from ADSCs (Fig. 3E). In addition, apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax) from diabetic mice (C57BL/KsJ db/db) and control (C57BL/KsJ db/m) mice were compared. Bcl-2 protein was significantly reduced in diabetic mice compared with control mice, whereas the protein expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and caspase-3 was increased. Injection of EVs from ADSCs reversed these trends (Fig. 3F). These results demonstrated that ADSC-derived EVs are capable of alleviating the pathological symptoms and inhibiting glomerular podocyte apoptosis in DN mice. The ability of mouse glomerular podocytes, MP5 cells, to internalize EVs from ADSCs was assessed using green fluorescent (PKH67)-labeled EVs. The presence of green fluorescence in MP5 cells was observed by fluorescence microscopy, which indicated that MP5 cells were able to internalize ADSC-derived EVs (Fig. 4A). To simulate the DN cell model in vitro, MP5 cells were induced by HG and treated with ADSC-derived EVs (25 μg/ml). Cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively. Although there was no difference in cell viability at 24 h in response to each treatment, at 48 h, high-glucose (HG) treatment markedly decreased MP5 cell viability relative to treatment with either normal glucose levels (NG) or mannitol (MA). Viability could be restored by cotreatment with HG and ADSC-derived EVs. No significant differences in MP5 cell viability were seen between the 48- and 72-h time points in response to treatment (Fig. 4B); therefore, the 48-h time point was chosen for all subsequent experiments. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis at 48 h after the same treatments described above. The results showed that compared with treatment with either NG or MA, HG induction markedly increased MP5 cell apoptosis, whereas cotreatment of HG and ADSC-derived EVs exhibited reduced cell apoptosis versus HG treatment alone (Fig. 4C). In addition, Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in MP5 cells after 48 h of each treatment. Treatment with HG significantly decreased the protein expression of Bcl-2, whereas increasing that of caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax compared with either NG or MA and cotreatment of HG and ADSC-derived EVs increased Bcl-2 protein expression and de-creased that of caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that EVs from ADSCs are able to suppress HG-mediated injury of podocytes in vitro. The expression of miR-26a-5p in HG-induced MP5 cells was measured by RT-qPCR after treatment with ADSC-derived EVs or PBS. miR-26a-5p expression was significantly lower after induction with HG than with treatment with NG or MA, but it was notably increased by treatment with ADSC-derived EVs containing miR-26a-5p (Fig. 5A). To confirm that ADSC-derived EVs can transfer miR-26a-5p into MP5 cells, Cy3-miR-26a-5p mimic was transfected into ADSCs and then added to MP5 cell media. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that MP5 cells became noticeably red after treatment (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrate that ADSC-derived EVs transfer miR-26a-5p into MP5 cells. To determine the effect of miR-26a-5p transferred by ADSC-derived EVs on HG-treated MP5 cells, HG-treated MP5 cells were transfected with either miR-26a-5p mimic, ADSC-derived EVs, or ADSC-derived EVs treated with miR-26a-5p inhibitor. Addition of either miR-26a-5p mimic or ADSC-derived EVs increased the expression of miR-26a-5p in HG-treated MP5 cells, whereas treatment of MP5 cells with ADSC-derived EVs containing miR-26a-5p inhibitor caused a decline in miR-26a-5p expression (Fig. 5C). Next, MP5 cell viability was assessed using the CCL-8 assay, and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Under HG conditions, treatment with either miR-26a-5p mimic or ADSC-derived EVs markedly improved cell viability and suppressed apoptosis of MP5 cells, whereas ADSC-derived EVs treated with miR-26a-5p inhibitor led to decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis (Fig. 5, D and E). In addition, Western blot analysis was used to detect apoptosis-related proteins in MP5 cells after each treatment. Treatment with miR-26a-5p mimic or ADSC-derived EVs resulted in increased Bcl-2 protein expression accompanied by a notable decrease in Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and caspase-3 expression. In contrast, ADSC-derived EVs treated with miR-26a-5p inhibitor exhibited markedly decreased Bcl-2 protein expression, whereas the expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and caspase-3 was significantly elevated (Fig. 5F). These results indicate that delivery of miR-26a-5p into MP5 cells by ADSC-derived EVs inhibits HG-induced apoptosis. The website TargetScan (RRID:SCR_010845) was able to predict specific binding sites between TLR4 and miR-26a-5p at nucleotides 4477–4484 (Fig. 6A). A Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay was used to confirm that TLR4 was a target of miR-26a-5p. Cotransfection of miR-26a-5p mimic and TLR4-3'UTR-WT resulted in a marked decrease in fluorescence intensity compared with the mimic negative control (NC) + TLR4-3'UTR-WT cotransfection; however, fluorescence intensity was unchanged in the presence of mimic NC + TLR4-3'UTR-MUT or miR-26a-5p mimic + TLR4-3'UTR-MUT (Fig. 6B). RT-qPCR of MP5 cells transfected with miR-26a-5p mimic or inhibitor resulted in a noticeably increased miR-26a-5p expression and a significantly decreased TLR4 expression, whereas opposite effects were detected after treatment with miR-26a-5p inhibitor (Fig. 6, C and D). Western blot analysis revealed that HG treatment of MP5 cells significantly increased TLR4 protein expression compared with treatment with NG or MA treatment, and this could be reversed by treatment with EVs from ADSCs (Fig. 6E). This suggests that miR-26a-5p transferred by ADSC-derived EVs could directly target the TLR4 gene. To detect the effect of the TLR4 gene regulated by ADSC-derived EVs on HG-induced MP5 cells, HG-treated MP5 cells were overexpressed with TLR4 and then treated with ADSC-derived EVs. First, Western blot analysis was used to detect the cellular protein expression of TLR4 upon each treatment. It was found that under HG conditions, compared with pcDNA-3.1 treatment, pcDNA-TLR4 significantly upregulated the protein expression of TLR4, which was reversed by treatment of pcDNA-TLR4- and ADSC-derived EVs (Fig. 6F). Subsequently, CCK-8 assay was performed to detect MP5 cell viability, and flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis. The results displayed that under HG conditions, relative to pcDNA-3.1 treatment, pcDNA-TLR4 significantly inhibited the protein cell viability while promoting cell apoptosis; however, promoted cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis were detected after treatment with pcDNA-TLR4- and ADSC-derived EVs (Fig. 6G and H). In addition, Western blot analysis was used to detect apoptosis-related proteins in HG-treated MP5 cells after treatment with each plasmid. pcDNA-TLR4 treatment markedly decreased Bcl-2 protein expression while significantly increasing cleaved caspase-3, caspase-3, and Bax protein expression relative to that of pcDNA-3.1 treatment. The opposite results were found after the treatment of HG-induced MP5 cells transfected with pcDNA-TLR4 and exposed to EVs from ADSCs containing miR-26a-5p (Fig. 6I). Combined with the above results, we concluded that miR-26a-5p delivered by ADSC-derived EVs targets TLR4, inhibiting HG-induced MP5 cell apoptosis. Subsequently, we explored the role of ADSC-derived EVs in the progression of DN via the regulation of the NF-κB pathway and VEGFA. We first investigated whether miR-26a-5p carrying EVs from ADSCs could inhibit the NF-κB pathway by downregulating TLR4 expression. After TLR4 overexpression, MP5 cells induced by HG were further treated with ADSC-derived EVs. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that HG treatment of MP5 cells resulted in p65 localization to the nucleus. EVs from ADSCs were able to reduce p65 nuclear localization, keeping more p65 in the cytoplasm. The effects of EVs could be negated by the overexpression of TLR4, which led to the nuclear localization of p65 protein again (Fig. 7A). Western blot analysis compared the protein expression of NF-κB pathway-related proteins IKKβ, IκBα, and p65 and the extent of their phosphorylation in the cells after each treatment. Treatment with EVs from ADSCs and pcDNA-3.1 control plasmid led to significantly decreased protein expression of IKKβ, IκBα, and p65 and the extent of their phosphorylation during HG induction, whereas each of these proteins was upregulated by ADSC-derived EVs cotreated with pcDNA-3.1-TLR4 (Fig. 7B). To verify whether EVs from ADSCs can inhibit apoptosis associated with HG treatment by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, HG-induced MP5 cells were treated with ADSC-derived EVs and the NF-κB pathway activator, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; 1 μg/ml). Western blot analysis indicated that PMA treatment significantly increased the protein expression of IKKβ, IκBα, p65, and VEGFA, as well as the extent of their phosphorylation in HG-induced MP5 cells compared with that of treatment with DMSO. Combined treatment with PMA and ADSC-derived EVs significantly decreased all these indicators compared with PMA treatment alone (Fig. 7C). PMA treatment also notably decreased cell viability, as measured by CCK-8 assay, and increased cell apoptosis, as measured by flow cytometry, relative to treatment with DMSO. This effect was reversed by treatment with PMA and ADSC-derived EVs combined (Fig. 7, D and E). HG-induced MP5 cells were further treated with ADSC-derived EVs after overexpression of VEGFA. VEGFA protein expression was significantly decreased after treatment with ADSC-derived EVs, whereas further overexpression of VEGFA upregulated the VEGFA protein expression (Fig. 7F). HG-induced MP5 cells treated with ADSC-derived EVs plus pcDNA-3.1 displayed increased viability and decreased apoptosis of MP5 cells compared with that of cells treated with PBS. This was reversed by treatment with ADSC-derived EVs and pcDNA-3-VEGFA (Fig. 7G). These data suggest that ADSC-derived EVs inhibit TLR4 expression, resulting in the downregulation of NF-κB/VEGFA and inhibition of HG-induced MP5 cell injury. To explore the effects of miR-26a-5p delivered by ADSC-derived EVs in a mouse model of DN, ADSC-derived EVs and/or miR-26a-5p antagomir were injected into C57BL/KsJ db/db mice via the tail vein. Mice were then observed for changes in urine protein, Scr, and BUN levels, and the histopathological changes of mice were detected using PAS staining. As illustrated, diabetic mice treated with PBS and antagomir NC displayed accumulated extracellular matrix in their kidney tissues, viability of mesangial cells, thickening of basement membrane, and nuclear lamina dispersion, with increased proteinuria in the lumen, hyaline degeneration, and severe vacuolar degeneration of renal tubular epithelial cells. ADSC-derived EVs and antagomir NC treatment led to decreased levels of urine protein, Scr, and BUN in DN modeled mice and alleviated histopathological changes compared with those of PBS and antagomir NC treatment. Treatment with ADSC-derived EVs and miR-26a-5p antagomir treatment markedly increased the levels of urine protein, Scr, and BUN while aggravating the histopathological changes in the mice compared with treatment with ADSC-derived EVs and antagomir NC (Fig. 8, A and B). TUNEL staining showed that treatment with both ADSC-derived EVs and antagomir NC significantly reduced cell apoptosis compared with that of DN mice treated with PBS and antagomir NC. Apoptosis was notably increased in DN mice treated with both ADSC-derived EVs and miR-26a-5p antagomir compared with treatment with ADSC-derived EVs and antagomir NC (Fig. 8C). RT-qPCR was used to analyze miR-26a-5p and TLR4 expression in the renal tissues of mice in response to different treatments. Treatment with ADSC-derived EVs and antagomir NC significantly increased miR-26a-5p expression and decreased TLR4 expression compared with PBS plus antagomir NC treatment; however, treatment with ADSC-derived EVs plus miR-26a-5p antagomir decreased miR-26a-5p expression and increased TLR4 expression compared with treatment with ADSC-derived EVs and antagomir NC (Fig. 8D). Western blot analysis was used"
https://openalex.org/W3037763346,"Many proteins that bind specific DNA sequences search the genome by combining three-dimensional diffusion with one-dimensional sliding on nonspecific DNA1–5. Here we combine resonance energy transfer and fluorescence correlation measurements to characterize how individual lac repressor (LacI) molecules explore the DNA surface during the one-dimensional phase of target search. To track the rotation of sliding LacI molecules on the microsecond timescale, we use real-time single-molecule confocal laser tracking combined with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (SMCT–FCS). The fluctuations in fluorescence signal are accurately described by rotation-coupled sliding, in which LacI traverses about 40 base pairs (bp) per revolution. This distance substantially exceeds the 10.5-bp helical pitch of DNA; this suggests that the sliding protein frequently hops out of the DNA groove, which would result in the frequent bypassing of target sequences. We directly observe such bypassing using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET). A combined analysis of the smFRET and SMCT–FCS data shows that LacI hops one or two grooves (10–20 bp) every 200–700 μs. Our data suggest a trade-off between speed and accuracy during sliding: the weak nature of nonspecific protein–DNA interactions underlies operator bypassing, but also speeds up sliding. We anticipate that SMCT–FCS, which monitors rotational diffusion on the microsecond timescale while tracking individual molecules with millisecond resolution, will be applicable to the real-time investigation of many other biological interactions and will effectively extend the accessible time regime for observing these interactions by two orders of magnitude. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and real-time confocal laser tracking with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy together characterize how individual lac repressor molecules bypass operator sites while exploring the DNA surface at microsecond timescales."

This study investigated CEUS-driven parameters as hemodynamic predictors for renal outcomes in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).Forty-eight patients who were diagnosed with AKI were prospectively enrolled and underwent CEUS at the occurrence of AKI. Parameters measured were the wash-in slope (WIS), time to peak intensity, peak intensity (PI), area under the time-intensity curve (AUC), mean transit time (MTT), time for full width at half maximum, and rise time (RT). The predictive performance of the CEUS-driven parameters for Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI stage, initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT), AKI recovery, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression was assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CEUS.Cortical RT (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.21) predicted the KDIGO stage 3 AKI. Cortical MTT (OR = 1.07) and RT (OR = 1.20) predicted the initiation of RRT. Cortical WIS (OR = 76.23) and medullary PI (OR = 1.25) predicted AKI recovery. Medullary PI (OR = 0.78) and AUC (OR = 1.00) predicted CKD progression. The areas under the ROC curves showed reasonable performance for predicting the initiation of RRT and AKI recovery. The sensitivity and specificity of the quantitative CEUS parameters were 60-83% and 62-77%, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.69-0.75.CEUS may be a supplemental tool in diagnosing the severity of AKI and predicting renal prognosis in patients with AKI."
https://openalex.org/W3037604132,"As the world’s human population increases, transformation of natural landscapes into urban habitats continues to increase. In Africa, rates of human population growth and urbanisation are among the highest in the world, but the impacts of these processes on the continent’s biodiversity remain largely unexplored. Furthermore, the effects of ongoing anthropogenic climate change are likely to be severe and to interact with urbanisation. Some organisms appear resilient to urbanisation, and even proliferate in human-modified environments. One such species is the peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus in Cape Town, South Africa. Using a long-term data set (1989–2014), we investigate the relationship between breeding attempts, timing of breeding and breeding performance under varying weather conditions. Exploring these issues along an urbanisation gradient, we focus on the role of artificially provided nest boxes, and their capacity to buffer against extreme weather events. Pairs in more urbanised areas, and particularly those in nest boxes, were more likely to breed and to commence breeding earlier. Additionally, pairs using nest boxes were more likely to breed in years with higher rainfall. Warm and dry weather conditions generally advanced the timing of breeding, although this relationship with weather was not seen for urban pairs using nest boxes. Furthermore, weather did not impact breeding performance directly (breeding success and fledged brood size), but timing of breeding did, with earlier breeders producing more fledglings. Our study shows that falcons breeding in specially provided nest boxes were less sensitive to local weather dynamics than pairs using more natural nest sites. This has important implications as it suggests that the managed provision of such nesting sites can help this key urban species to cope with extreme weather events, which are predicted to increase with climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3037947663,"Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE) are an important cause of nosocomial infections, which are rapidly transmitted in hospitals. To identify possible transmission routes, we applied combined genomics and contact-network modeling to retrospectively evaluate routine VRE screening data generated by the infection control program of a hemato-oncology unit. Over 1 year, a total of 111 VRE isolates from 111 patients were collected by anal swabs in a tertiary care hospital in Southern Germany. All isolated VRE were whole-genome sequenced, followed by different in-depth bioinformatics analyses including genotyping and determination of phylogenetic relations, aiming to evaluate a standardized workflow. Patient movement data were used to overlay sequencing data to infer transmission events and strain dynamics over time. A predominant clone harboring vanB and exhibiting genotype ST117/CT469 (n = 67) was identified. Our comprehensive combined analyses suggested intra-hospital spread, especially of clone ST117/CT469, despite of extensive screening, single room placement, and contact isolation. A new interactive tool to visualize these complex data was designed. Furthermore, a patient-contact network-modeling approach was developed, which indicates both the periodic import of the clone into the hospital and its spread within the hospital due to patient movements. The analyzed spread of VRE was most likely due to placement of patients in the same room prior to positivity of screening. We successfully demonstrated the added value for this combined strategy to extract well-founded knowledge from interdisciplinary data sources. The combination of patient-contact modeling and high-resolution typing unraveled the transmission dynamics within the hospital department and, additionally, a constant VRE influx over time."
https://openalex.org/W3037027057,"Objective There is an increasing need for small diameter vascular grafts with superior host hemo- and cytocompatibilities, such as low activation of platelets and leukocytes. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether the preparation of bacterial nanocellulose grafts with different inner surfaces has an impact on in vitro host cytocompatibility. Methods We have synthesized five different grafts in a bioreactor, namely open interface surface (OIS), inverted (INV), partially air dried (PAD), surface formed in air contact (SAC) and standard (STD) that were characterized by a different surface roughness. The grafts (length 55 mm, inner diameter 5 mm) were attached to heparinized polyvinyl chloride tubes, loaded with human blood and rotated at 37°C for 4 hours. Then, blood was analyzed for frequencies of cellular fractions, oxidative products, soluble complement and thrombin factors. The results were compared to clinically approved grafts made of polyethylene terephthalate and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. Additionally, blood platelets were labelled with 111Indium-oxine to visualize the distribution of adherent platelets in the loop by scintigraphy. Results SAC nanocellulose grafts with the lowest surface roughness exhibited superior performance with <10% leukocyte and <50% thrombocyte loss in contrast to other grafts that exhibited >65% leukocyte and >90% thrombocyte loss. Of note, SAC nanocellulose grafts showed lowest radioactivity with scintigraphy analyses, indicating reduced platelet adhesion. Although the levels of reactive oxygen species and cell free DNA did not differ significantly, the levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes were lowest in SAC grafts. However, all nanocellulose grafts exhibited enhanced complement activation. Conclusion The systematic variation of the inner surfaces of BNC vascular grafts significantly improves biocompatibility. Especially, SAC grafts exhibited the lowest loss of platelets as well as leukocytes and additionally significantly diminished activation of the coagulation system. Further animal studies are needed to study in vivo biocompatibilities."
https://openalex.org/W3037746334,"To estimate the prevalence of nonadherence to treatment and its relationship with social support and social context in patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy followed-up in primary care.This was an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study with an analytical approach. A total of 593 patients between 65-74 years of age with multimorbidity (≥3 diseases) and polypharmacy (≥5 drugs) during the last three months and agreed to participate in the MULTIPAP Study. The main variable was adherence (Morisky-Green). The predictors were social support (structural support and functional support (DUFSS)); sociodemographic variables; indicators of urban objective vulnerability; health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L-VAS & QALY); and clinical variables. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses with logistic regression models and robust estimators were performed.Four out of ten patients were nonadherent, 47% had not completed primary education, 28.7% had an income ≤1050 €/month, 35% reported four or more IUVs, and the average perceived health-related quality of life (HRQOL) EQ-5D-5L-VAS was 65.5. The items that measure functional support, with significantly different means between nonadherent and adherent patients were receiving love and affection (-0.23; 95%CI: -0.40;-0.06), help when ill (-0.25; 95%CI: -0.42;-0.08), useful advice (-0.20; 95%CI: -0.37;-0.02), social invitations (-0.22; 95%CI:-0.44;-0.01), and recognition (-0.29; 95%CI:-0.50;-0.08). Factors associated with nonadherence were belonging to the medium vs. low tertile of functional support (0.62; 95%CI: 0.42;0.94), reporting less than four IUVs (0.69; 95%CI: 0.46;1.02) and higher HRQOL perception (0.98; 95%CI: 0.98;0.99).Among patients 65-74 years of age with multimorbidity and polypharmacy, lower functional support was related to nonadherence to treatment. The nonadherence decreased in those patients with higher functional support, lower urban vulnerability and higher perceived health status according to the visual analog scale of health-related quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W3036362009,"Concern has been expressed over how well Africa is prepared to cope with the pandemic of Covid-19. Will rural populations with low levels of education know how to apply community-based infection control? We undertook fieldwork in two villages in central Sierra Leone to gain insight into how rural people faced with Covid-19 assess epidemic infection risks.Two communities were selected based on prior contrasted exposure to Ebola Virus Disease-one with substantial number of cases and the other having resisted infection through strong community sequestration measures. We assessed understanding of infection risks via an experimental game. This asked players to express a preference for one of two diseases, one resembling Ebola with lower risk of infection and the other resembling Covid-19 with lower risk of death. Players were not told the identity of the diseases.In total 107 adult villagers played the game (58% women). Half (52%) preferred the disease model with lower risk of infection, 29% preferred the model with lower risk of death, while 21% saw the combined risk of infection and death as being equivalent. Differences in reactions between the two locations were small despite different experiences of Ebola. Asked to explain their choices 48% of players cited information on infection risks modelled by the game and 31% stated that their choices reflected awareness of the need for personal action and respect for local regulations. We concluded that villagers thoughtfully assess disease risks and that some are good intuitive statisticians.Results suggest rural people in Sierra Leone retain the lessons of experience from the Ebola outbreak of 2014-15 and will be able to apply these lessons to a new infectious disease for which have no prior practical experience. Our expectation is that rural populations will understand Covid-19 control measures, thus reducing need for draconian enforcement."
https://openalex.org/W3037383206,"Despite remarkable progress in the reduction of death in under-five children, neonatal mortality has shown little or no concomitant reduction globally. It is also one of the most common causes of neonatal death in Ethiopia. Little is known on predictors of neonatal sepsis. Risk based screening and commencement of treatment appreciably reduces neonatal death and illness. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to identify predictors of neonatal sepsis in public referral hospitals of Northwest Ethiopia.Institutional based unmatched case-control study was conducted among a total of 231 neonates in Debre Markos and Felege Hiwot referral hospitals from March 2018- April 2018. Neonates who fulfill the preseted criteria for sepsis were considered as cases and neonates diagnosed with other medical reasons except sepsis were controls. For each case, two consecutive controls were selected by simple random sampling method. Data were collected using structured pretested questionnaire through a face to face interview with index mothers and by reviewing neonatal record using checklist. The collected data were entered into Epi data version 3.1 and exported to STATA/ SE software version 14. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed. Statistical significance was declared at P<0.05.Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that, duration of rupture of membrane ≥ 18hours was significantly associated with sepsis (AOR = 10.4, 95%CI = 2.3-46.5). The other independent predictors of neonatal sepsis were number of maternal antenatal care service ≤3 (AOR = 4.4, 95%CI = 1.7-11.5), meconium stained amniotic fluid (AOR = 3.9, 95%CI = 1.5-9.8), urinary tract infection during pregnancy (AOR = 10.8, 95% CI = 3.4-33.9), intranatal fever (AOR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.1-9.5), first minute APGAR score <7 (AOR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.3-7.7), resuscitation at birth (AOR = 5.4, 95% CI = 1.9-15.5), nasogastric tube insertion (AOR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.4-10.2).Neonatal invasive procedures, ANC follow up during pregnancy, different conditions during birth like meconium stained amniotic fluid, low APGAR score and resuscitation at birth were the independent predictors of neonatal sepsis."

Photoreceptors are of central importance for many organisms, from bacteria, fungi, and plants to animals, for the determination of intensity and frequency of light in their environment and for the adequate response to beneficial or harmful conditions. Moreover, attention has been attracted in recent years by the successful engineering of photoreceptors toward an application as optogenetic tools for the dissection of enzymatic and neuronal pathways in living organisms. For both the natural function and the application, it is of importance to elucidate the mechanism of these proteins. Accordingly, the light-induced response of photoreceptors has been studied extensively with a plethora of biophysical techniques in vitro (1Kottke T. Xie A.H. Larsen D.S. Hoff W.D. Photoreceptors take charge: emerging principles for light sensing.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2018; 47 (29539272): 291-31310.1146/annurev-biophys-070317-033047Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the proteins are usually investigated in a defined and simplified buffer solution, strongly differing from the intracellular conditions. The presence of small molecules, protein-protein interactions, the effect of macromolecular crowding, the different redox potential, and the different oxygen level might affect the light-induced response of a photoreceptor in cells. Indeed, it has been shown for plant cryptochrome 2 from Arabidopsis in intact insect cells that cellular conditions promote alternative reaction pathways (2Engelhard C. Wang X. Robles D. Moldt J.

Accordingly, results from in vitro experiments should be scrutinized under intracellular conditions to provide for biological relevance. To complement in vitro measurements, much effort has been put into establishing a broad field of techniques to study protein mechanisms in an intracellular environment (6Gierasch L.M. Gershenson A. Post-reductionist protein science, or putting Humpty Dumpty back together again.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5 (19841622): 774-77710.1038/nchembio.241Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For soluble photoreceptors, such approaches include UV-visible spectroscopy on plant seedlings (7Butler W.L. Lane H.C. Siegelman H.W.

A limitation of these pioneering studies has been the focus on the cofactor and its photoreaction, whereas the structural response of the protein has not been addressed. For example, in vitro experiments on light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) proteins revealed a signal propagation from the cofactor to the effector via structural changes in flanking helices (11Harper S.M. Christie J.M. Gardner K.H. Disruption of the LOV-Jα helix interaction activates phototropin kinase activity.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (15610012): 16184-1619210.1021/bi048092iCrossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 12Diensthuber R.P.

The question arises of whether this mechanism might be altered by the intracellular environment. LOV proteins are blue light photoreceptors that can be found in various organisms, such as plants, algae, fungi, or bacteria (13Losi A. Gärtner W. Solving blue light riddles: new lessons from flavin-binding LOV photoreceptors.Photochem. Photobiol. 2017; 93 (27861974): 141-15810.1111/php.12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The first member identified was phototropin in plants, which is composed of two LOV sensory domains, LOV1 and LOV2, activating a C-terminal serine-threonine kinase upon illumination (Fig. 1A) (14Christie J.M. Salomon M. Nozue K. Wada M. Briggs W.R. LOV (light, oxygen, or voltage) domains of the blue-light photoreceptor phototropin (nph1): binding sites for the chromophore flavin mononucleotide.Proc. Natl.

The LOV domains contain a noncovalently bound FMN, which reacts upon illumination with a nearby located cysteine to form an adduct (15Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Photochemical and mutational analysis of the FMN-binding domains of the plant blue light receptor phototropin.Biochemistry. 2000; 39 (10924135): 9401-941010.1021/bi000585+Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Aureochromes found in algae belong to the LOV protein family as well but have an unusual, inverted topology (Fig. 1B). The LOV domain of aureochromes is connected to a basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) at the N terminus instead of at the C terminus. Aureochromes act as a blue light–dependent transcription factor regulating high-light acclimation, photomorphogenesis, and cell division in algae (16Takahashi F. Yamagata D. Ishikawa M. Fukamatsu Y.

The LOV domain of aureochromes has been applied successfully in optogenetics as a light-dependent dimerizer for receptor tyrosine kinase activation (19Grusch M. Schelch K. Riedler R. Reichhart E.

In the LOV domain of aureochrome, formation of the adduct leads to unfolding of a flanking Jα-helix (21Herman E. Sachse M. Kroth P.G. Kottke T.

As a consequence of an allosteric regulation, the flanking A′α-helix then unfolds and exposes a hydrophobic β-sheet surface required for dimerization (22Heintz U. Schlichting I. Blue light-induced LOV domain dimerization enhances the affinity of Aureochrome 1a for its target DNA sequence.eLife. 2016; 5 (26754770): e1186010.7554/eLife.11860Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Herman E.

The structural change induces a signal progression from the A′α-helix to the bZIP domain (26Toyooka T. Hisatomi O. Takahashi F. Kataoka H. Terazima M. Photoreactions of aureochrome-1.Biophys.

The presence of random DNA leads to a bZIP stabilization and suppression of the unfolding. In contrast, in the presence of the ACGT core sequence, additional α-helical elements and loop elements are formed by light (27Banerjee A. Herman E. Serif M. Maestre-Reyna M. Hepp S. Pokorny R.

FTIR difference spectroscopy provides an established method to analyze structural changes of proteins in solution upon an external perturbation, such as light, electrical potential, temperature, or solute concentration (33Mäntele W.

Common configurations for applying FTIR spectroscopy are the transmission mode, in which the IR light passes the sample sandwiched between two IR-transmissive windows, and the attenuated total reflection (ATR) configuration, in which total reflection within an internal reflection element (IRE) is used to generate an evanescent wave at the interface to the sample. These approaches are noninvasive, label-free, under ambient conditions, without any size limitation for the macromolecules investigated, and the acquisition time is fast. Therefore, it is highly promising to transfer FTIR difference spectroscopy from an in vitro to an in-cell application. Single cells have already been studied by using synchrotron radiation to investigate the effect of arsenite on human cells (36Munro K.L. Bambery K.R. Carter E.A. Puskar L. Tobin M.J. Wood B.R. Dillon C.T. Synchrotron radiation infrared microspectroscopy of arsenic-induced changes to intracellular biomolecules in live leukemia cells.Vib.

The latter cells represent an ideal sample, because of the high, native concentration of 2–3 mm of the insoluble, transmembrane photoreceptor. The application of ATR difference spectroscopy on rod cells showed changes in protein signals, which were assigned to the intracellular transducin movement toward the evanescent field (38Massaro S.

To our knowledge, IR difference spectroscopy on soluble photoreceptors in living or intact cells has not yet been reported. These comprise a large variety of receptors, such as LOV proteins, BLUF (blue light using flavin) proteins, cryptochromes, phytochromes, or PYPs (photoactive yellow proteins) (1Kottke T. Xie A.H.

In this study, we selected the LOV domain of aureochrome1a from the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum (PtAureo1a) (Fig. 1B) and the LOV1 domain of phototropin from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrPhot) (Fig. 1A) for establishing in-cell investigations because they have already been characterized by FTIR difference spectroscopy in vitro (21Herman E.

We present here in-cell IR difference (ICIRD) spectroscopy in the transmission mode and the ATR configuration as an application for the investigation of the light-induced structural response of soluble photoreceptors in living cells. We observed with ICIRD spectroscopy a specific suppression of changes in secondary structure elements caused by the intracellular environment. Investigation on the bZIP-LOV module leads us to postulate an alternative signal progression mechanism from the sensor domain to the effector. These findings emphasize the impact of the intracellular environment on LOV photoreceptors and need to be considered in future studies of physiological function as well as optogenetic application. To characterize our sample for in-cell spectroscopy, we first applied fluorescence spectroscopy to the isolated LOV domain of the blue light receptor PtAureo1a. The emission spectra of free and bound FMN can be readily differentiated by the hypsochromic shift of the fluorescence emission maximum from 538 to 497 nm with a shoulder at 528 nm by binding of the FMN to the LOV domain (Fig. 2A) (41Holzer W. Penzkofer A. Fuhrmann M. Hegemann P. Spectroscopic characterization of flavin mononucleotide bound to the LOV1 domain of Phot1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 75 (12017473): 479-48710.1562/0031-8655(2002)075<0479:SCOFMB>2.0.CO;2Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The LOV domain was moderately expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using low-level induction. Indeed, the fluorescence spectrum of E. coli BL21 expressing the LOV domain showed the characteristic emission of FMN bound to LOV with a negligible contribution from the signal of free flavin in the cells (Fig. 2A). Additionally, we used the fluorescence signal to determine the copy number of the protein in the cells. We correlated the emission intensity at 495 nm of LOV in vitro with the absolute number of proteins in the probed volume by determining its absorbance at 447 nm and using the extinction coefficient of free FMN at 450 nm (42Whitby L.G. A new method for preparing flavin-adenine dinucleotide.Biochem. J. 1953; 54 (13058921): 437-44210.1042/bj0540437Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), the path length, and the sample volume (Fig. S1). To determine the cell number, the turbidity was analyzed and correlated with the counted cell number. We finally obtained a protein copy number per cell of ∼300,000 (see “Experimental procedures”). The corresponding protein concentration of LOV in the cells is about 330 μm and 120 μm assuming a cell volume of 1.5 fl (starved) or 4 fl (in medium), respectively (43Volkmer B. Heinemann M. Condition-dependent cell volume and concentration of Escherichia coli to facilitate data conversion for systems biology modeling.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 (21829590): e2312610.1371/journal.pone.0023126Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Illumination of LOV leads to formation of an adduct of the FMN with a cysteine, which reduces the absorbance at 447 nm as well as the fluorescence intensity at 497 nm (15Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Photochemical and mutational analysis of the FMN-binding domains of the plant blue light receptor phototropin.Biochemistry. 2000; 39 (10924135): 9401-941010.1021/bi000585+Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 41Holzer W.

Therefore, the kinetics of the back reaction can be analyzed by studying the recovery of either absorbance or fluorescence intensity. Considering the strong turbidity of cells, fluorescence spectroscopy was used here to investigate the decay kinetics of the adduct in the cells. A cell suspension of E. coli BL21 expressing LOV was illuminated with blue light for 100 ms, and fluorescence recovery at 495 nm was monitored (Fig. 2B). Fitting with a monoexponential function, we obtained a time constant of 2800 ± 160 s in cells and 2030 ± 330 s in vitro at pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 25 μm LOV. Therefore, the presence of the intracellular environment stabilizes the adduct. It has been shown that the recovery is strongly concentration-dependent because of a monomer-dimer equilibrium. UV-visible studies on LOV recovery at 30 μm in vitro showed time constants of 320 s (14%) and 2290 s (86%), which were assigned to the monomer and dimer of LOV by comparison with variants that are constitutively monomeric (LOVΔJα) (21Herman E. Sachse M. Kroth P.G. Kottke T. Blue-light-induced unfolding of the Jα helix allows for the dimerization of aureochrome-LOV from the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.Biochemistry. 2013; 52 (23621750): 3094-310110.1021/bi400197uCrossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or dimeric (bZIP-LOV) (27Banerjee A. Herman E. Serif M. Maestre-Reyna M. Hepp S. Pokorny R. Kroth P.G. Essen L.O. Kottke T. Allosteric communication between DNA-binding and light-responsive domains of diatom class I aureochromes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27179025): 5957-597010.1093/nar/gkw420Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), respectively. Even at 2.4 mm, a concentration much higher than in cells, the recovery was faster, with a time constant of 1660 ± 400 s obtained by FTIR spectroscopy (21Herman E. Sachse M. Kroth P.G. Kottke T.

Hospital-based violence intervention programs (HVIPs), which strive to prevent re-injury through intensive case management, have emerged as a successful and cost-effective strategy to address this issue. Despite the importance of strong therapeutic relationships between clients and their case managers, specific case manager behaviors and attributes that drive the formation of these relationships have not been elucidated.A qualitative analysis with a modified grounded theory approach was conducted to gain insight into what clients perceive to be crucial to the formation of a strong client-case manager relationship. Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with prior clients of our hospital's HVIP. The interviews were analyzed using constant comparison method for recurrent themes.Several key themes emerged from the interviews. Clients emphasized that their case managers must: 1) understand and relate to their sociocultural contexts, 2) navigate the initial in-hospital meeting to successfully create connection, 3) exhibit true compassion and care, 4) serve as role models, 5) act as portals of opportunity, and 6) engender mutual respect and pride.This study identifies key behaviors of case managers that facilitate the formation of strong therapeutic relationships at the different stages of client recovery. This study's findings emphasize the importance of case managers being culturally aligned with and embedded in their clients' communities. This work can provide a roadmap for case managers to form optimally effective relationships with clients."

Previous research mainly focused on the identification and classification of urban functions using a variety of data and methods; however, little attention has been paid to the quantitative measurement of changes in urban functions, and to their temporal and spatial evolution. With the help of urban land use maps, we used the overlay analysis and the transition matrix to quantitatively measure the enhancement and weakening of urban functions and their spatial differences, by analyzing the relationship between urban land development and redevelopment. Accordingly, the change state of urban function enhancement and weakening could be divided into six categories. Moreover, the results of research on residential, commercial, public service, and industrial functions show that changes in different urban functions have different temporal and spatial characteristics. Our findings on the enhancement and weakening of urban functions in the central city of Changchun provide theoretical support for the sustainable development of urban space in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3037713288,"ZapE/Afg1 is a component of the inner cell membrane of some eubacteria and the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes. This protein is involved in FtsZ-dependent division of eubacteria. In the yeast and human mitochondrion, ZapE/Afg1 likely interacts with Oxa1 and facilitates the degradation of mitochondrion-encoded subunits of respiratory complexes. Furthermore, the depletion of ZapE increases resistance to apoptosis, decreases oxidative stress tolerance, and impacts mitochondrial protein homeostasis. It remains unclear whether ZapE is a multifunctional protein, or whether some of the described effects are just secondary phenotypes. Here, we have analyzed the functions of ZapE in Trypanosoma brucei, a parasitic protist, and an important model organism. Using a newly developed proximity-dependent biotinylation approach (BioID2), we have identified the inner mitochondrial membrane insertase Oxa1 among three putative interacting partners of ZapE, which is present in two paralogs. RNAi-mediated depletion of both ZapE paralogs likely affected the function of respiratory complexes I and IV. Consistently, we show that the distribution of mitochondrial ZapE is restricted only to organisms with Oxa1, respiratory complexes, and a mitochondrial genome. We propose that the evolutionarily conserved interaction of ZapE with Oxa1, which is required for proper insertion of many inner mitochondrial membrane proteins, is behind the multifaceted phenotype caused by the ablation of ZapE."

Methods We retrospectively studied all treatment-naïve patients with PCV who received PDT combined with either IVR or IVA. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), central choroidal thickness (CCT), the number of additional injections, and the presence of polypoidal lesions, as indicated by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), during 1 year were evaluated. Results Forty-four eyes were assessed at the 1-year follow-up examination. Of these, 23 were treated with PDT combined with IVR (PDT/IVR group), and 21 were treated with PDT combined with IVA (PDT/IVA group). In both groups, BCVA was shown to be significantly improved 1 year after the initial treatment. CMT and CCT were also significantly decreased after 1 year. There were no significant differences in the changes in BCVA or CMT between the two groups. However, the change in CCT in the PDT/IVA group was significantly larger than that of the PDT/IVR group (P < 0.001). The mean number of additional injections was 0.78 ± 0.21 in the PDT/IVR group and 0.57 ± 0.21 in the PDT/IVA group with no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.45). The polyp regression rate at 12 months was 78.2% in the PDT/IVR group and 78.9% in the PDT/IVA group with no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusions PDT combined with either IVR or IVA was well tolerated and appeared to improve both vision and anatomy in patients with PCV. PDT/IVA may have a more pronounced effect on macular choroidal thickness at 1-year follow-up."

Focusing on the cell cycle, we examined the DNA mutations and chromosome arm-level aneuploidy within tumours with low, intermediate and high cell-cycle activity in 9515 pan-cancer patients with 32 different tumour types. Boxplots showed that cell-cycle activity varied broadly across and within all cancers. TP53 and PIK3CA mutations were common in all cell cycle score (CCS) tertiles but with increasing frequency as cell-cycle activity levels increased (P < 0.001). Mutations in BRAF and gains in 16p were less frequent in CCS High tumours (P < 0.001). In Kaplan–Meier analysis, patients whose tumours were CCS Low had a longer Progression Free Interval (PFI) relative to Intermediate or High (P < 0.001) and this significance remained in multivariable analysis (CCS Intermediate: HR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.17–1.60, CCS High: 1.54; 1.29–1.84, CCS Low = Ref). These results demonstrate that whilst similar DNA alterations can be found at all cell-cycle activity levels, some notable exceptions exist. Moreover, independent prognostic information can be derived on a pan-cancer level from a simple measure of cell-cycle activity."
https://openalex.org/W3038099884,"The continuous variation of the seasonal influenza viruses, particularly A(H1N1)pdm09, persistently threatens human life and health around the world. In local areas of southwest china, the large time-scale genomic research on A(H1N1)pdm09 is still insufficient. Here, we sequenced 45 whole-genome sequences of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Lincang, China, from 2014 to 2018, by next-generation sequencing technology to characterize molecular mechanisms of their origin and evolution. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that the A(H1N1)pdm09 strains circulating in Lincang belong to clade 6B and the subclade 6B.1A predominates in 2018. Further, the strains in 2018 possess elevated evolutionary rate as compared to strains in other years. Several newly emerged mutations for HA (hemagglutinin) in 2018 are revealed (i.e., S183P and R221K). Intriguingly, the substitution R221K falls into the RBS (receptor binding site) of HA protein, which could affect antigenic properties of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and another substitution S183P near to RBS with a high covering frequency (11/14 strains) in 2018 is exactly located at the epitope B. Notably, the NA (neuraminidase) protein harbors a new mutation I23T, potentially involved in N-glycosylation. Based on the background with a higher evolutionary rate in 2018 strains, we deeply evaluate the potential vaccine efficacy against Lincang strains and discover a substantive decline of the vaccine efficacy in 2018. Our analyses reaffirm that the real-time molecular surveillance and timely updated vaccine strains for prevention and control of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 are crucial in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3037017503,"Ectodomain shedding is a post-translational modification mechanism by which the entire extracellular domain of membrane proteins is liberated through juxtamembrane processing. Because shedding rapidly and irreversibly alters the characteristics of cells, this process is properly regulated. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the propensity of membrane proteins to shedding are largely unknown. Here, we present evidence that negatively charged amino acids within the stalk region, an unstructured juxtamembrane region at which shedding occurs, contribute to shedding susceptibility. We show that two activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) protein variants produced by alternative splicing have different susceptibilities to ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17)-mediated shedding. Of note, the inclusion of a stalk region encoded by a 39-bp-long alternative exon conferred shedding resistance. We found that this alternative exon encodes a large proportion of negatively charged amino acids, which we demonstrate are indispensable for conferring the shedding resistance. We also show that the introduction of negatively charged amino acids into the stalk region of shedding-susceptible ALCAM variant protein attenuates its shedding. Furthermore, we observed that negatively charged amino acids residing in the stalk region of Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4) are indispensable for its shedding resistance. Collectively, our results indicate that negatively charged amino acids within the stalk region interfere with the shedding of multiple membrane proteins. We conclude that the composition of the stalk region determines the shedding susceptibility of membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3037504747,"We previously demonstrated that hexokinase II (HK2) dissociation from mitochondria during cardiac ischemia correlates with cytochrome c (cyt-c) loss, oxidative stress and subsequent reperfusion injury. However, whether HK2 release is the primary signal mediating this ischemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction was not established. To investigate this, we studied the effects of dissociating HK2 from isolated heart mitochondria. Mitochondria isolated from Langendorff-perfused rat hearts before and after 30 min global ischemia ± ischemic preconditioning (IPC) were subject to in vitro dissociation of HK2 by incubation with glucose-6-phosphate at pH 6.3. Prior HK2 dissociation from pre- or end-ischemic heart mitochondria had no effect on their cyt-c release, respiration (± ADP) or mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. Inner mitochondrial membrane morphology was assessed indirectly by monitoring changes in light scattering (LS) and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Although no major ultrastructure differences were detected between pre- and end-ischemia mitochondria, the amplitude of changes in LS was reduced in the latter. This was prevented by IPC but not mimicked in vitro by HK2 dissociation. We also observed more Drp1, a mitochondrial fission protein, in end-ischemia mitochondria. IPC failed to prevent this increase but did decrease mitochondrial-associated dynamin 2. In vitro HK2 dissociation alone cannot replicate ischemia-induced effects on mitochondrial function implying that in vivo dissociation of HK2 modulates end-ischemia mitochondrial function indirectly perhaps involving interaction with mitochondrial fission proteins. The resulting changes in mitochondrial morphology and cristae structure would destabilize outer / inner membrane interactions, increase cyt-c release and enhance mPTP sensitivity to [Ca2+]."

Sand flies were collected bimonthly from May 2013 to July 2014, using automatic light traps exposed for three consecutive nights in peridomiciliary areas of nine houses with previous reports of VL and TL. ITS1-PCR and DNA sequencing were performed for trypanosomatids identification. A total of 16,771 sand flies were collected belonging to 23 species. The most abundant species was Nyssomyia whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho, 1939) (70.9%), followed by Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva, 1912) (15.2%) and Migonemyia migonei (França, 1920) (9.1%). Leishmania amazonensis DNA was detected in Ny. whitmani (four pools) and Le. braziliensis DNA was detected in Psychodopygus lloydi (one pool). In seven pools of Ny. whitmani and in one pool of Lu. longipalpis positive for Leishmania DNA, the parasite species was not determined due to the low quality of the sequences. Moreover, DNA of Herpetomonas spp. was detected in Ny. whitmani (two pools) and Cortelezzii complex (one pool). DNA of Crithidia spp. was detected in Ny. whitmani and Ps. lloydi (both one pool). Our results suggest that Ny. whitmani may be involved in the transmission of Le. amazonensis in the study area. The molecular detection of Le. amazonensis suggests the presence of this species in a sylvatic cycle between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts in the region of Casa Branca. Our data also reveal the occurrence of other non-Leishmania trypanosomatids in sand flies in Casa Branca District."
https://openalex.org/W3037040569,"Background Early supported discharge (ESD) models of care for stroke survivors coordinate inpatient and community services, with the aim of reducing length of stay. While there is an established evidence base around the clinical outcomes of ESD), less is known about the implementation of this approach into existing stroke care service. The aim of this case study was to describe staff perceptions of the implementation of an ESD model of care for stroke survivors at a large metropolitan public hospital in Australia. Methods This case study utilised a mixed methods design, which was designed in explicit alignment with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Participants included staff that referred patients for ESD, and staff involved in the planning, implementation or delivery of ESD. Survey data was collected at three time points (ESD commencement, 3 months and 6 months), and focus groups were undertaken at the conclusion of the study. All quantitative data was analysed descriptive, while qualitative data was evaluated using thematic analysis. Results Results from both sources of data identified changes in staff perceptions of ESD implementation over time. While very few changes were statistically significant, they were diverse patterns of change across the CFIR constructs over time. The characteristics of individuals and ESD characteristics attracted consistently positive perceptions, while patient needs and resources was the most prevalent theme within the data. While perceptions of factors related to the inner setting were mixed, there was a steady improvement in perceptions about the process across the later stages of implementation. Conclusions The sophistication of knowledge translation and implementation in modern complex healthcare environments is highlighted by the multiple interactions between the CFIR domains and constructs. While the implementation process described was generally positive and effective, using the CFIR as a framework confirmed that it also entailed some challenges and unanticipated outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3037359334,"Are bilinguals more creative than monolinguals? Some prior research suggests bilinguals are more creative because the knowledge representations for their second language are similarly structured to those of highly creative people. However, there is contrasting research showing that the knowledge representations of bilinguals’ second language are actually structured like those of less creative people. Finally, there is growing skepticism about there being differences between bilinguals and monolinguals on non-language tasks (e.g., the bilingual advantage for executive control). We tested whether bilinguals tested in their second language are more or less creative than both monolinguals and bilinguals tested in their first language. Participants also took a repeated semantic fluency test that we used to estimate individual semantic networks for each participant. We analyzed our results with Bayesian statistics and found support for the null hypothesis that bilingualism offers no advantage for creativity. Further, using best practices for estimating semantic networks, we found support for the hypothesis that there is no association between an individual’s semantic network and their creativity. This is in contrast with published research, and suggests that some of those findings may have been the result of idiosyncrasies, outdated methods for estimating semantic networks, or statistical noise. Our results call into question reported relations between bilingualism and creativity, as well as semantic network structure as an explanatory mechanism for individual differences in creativity."

Identifying molecular components in this pathway is critical to understanding fundamental properties of muscarinic signaling under physiological conditions to improve potential therapies that augment parasympathetic output to improve and/or preserve cardiovascular function.

To further specify the role of M2R in mediating RyR2 phosphorylation, we employed M2R knockout mice (M2R KO) and measured RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation using Western blotting analyses. Isolated cardiomyocytes from M2R KO mice failed to exhibit increased RyR2 2808 phosphorylation in response to CCh as observed in WT myocytes (Fig. 1A) and displayed no differences in baseline RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation (Fig. S1). Further, we used the M2R/M4R allosteric activator LY2119620 to investigate the role of M2R in regulating RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation. LY2119620 significantly increased phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808 in the presence of CCh (Fig. 1C). These results establish the specific role of M2R in CCh-mediated phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808.

To this end, we measured NO release in response to CCh using fluorescent NO indicator DAF-FM in ventricular cardiomyocytes. Fig. 2 (A and B) shows that isolated cardiomyocytes treated with CCh display a significant increase in NO release as measured by 4-Amino-5-Methylamino-2′,7′-Difluorofluorescein Diacetate (DAF-FM Diacetate) fluorescence. Additionally, we measured the NO byproducts nitrate and nitrite as an index for total NO generation in ventricular myocytes. Fig. S2 demonstrates that allosteric potentiation of M2R with LY2119620 and CCh significantly increases total nitrate/nitrite production in ventricular myocytes. This effect was mediated via nitric oxide synthase (NOS) as nonspecific inhibition curtailed total NO generation (Fig. S2). In cardiac myocytes, NO is generated by two NOS isoforms: neuronal (NOS1, nNOS) and endothelial (NOS3, eNOS) nitric oxide synthase enzymes. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with a specific NOS1 inhibitor, Nω-propyl-l-arginine hydrochloride (NP), prevented NO release in response to CCh (Fig. 2, D–F). In addition, we employed pharmacological inhibitors of NOS1 or NOS3 and measured phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808 using Western blotting analyses. Consistent with the results of the experiments with NO measurement, myocytes treated with the specific NOS1 inhibitor NP abrogated CCh-mediated RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, inhibition of NOS3 with N5-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine dihydrochloride (LN) did not prevent CCh-mediated increase in RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Additionally, genetic ablation of NOS1 but not NOS3 prevented RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation induced by CCh (Fig. 3, C and E). It has been shown previously that ablation of NOS1 does not affect NOS3 protein expression (19Ashley E.A. Sears C.E. Bryant S.M. Watkins H.C. Casadei B. Cardiac nitric oxide synthase 1 regulates basal and β-adrenergic contractility in murine ventricular myocytes.Circulation. 2002; 105: 3011-301610.1161/01.CIR.0000019516.31040.2DCrossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similarly, NOS3 KO mice displayed no significant alteration in NOS1 protein compared with WT controls (Fig. S3). Additionally, we observed no significant changes in levels of total or RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation in these samples (Fig. S3). Collectively, these results suggest that cholinergic-induced RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation is mediated specifically by NOS1. Endogenous NOS1 in various cell types has been linked to several upstream kinase systems including Akt (20Trappanese D.M. Liu Y. McCormick R.C. Cannavo A. Nanayakkara G. Baskharoun M.M. Jarrett H.

We examined the role of this system in mediating M2R-dependent activation of NOS1 and RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation. Strikingly, and for the first time in adult mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes, we show that application of CCh increases phosphorylation of Akt serine 473 (Fig. 4A). Thus, our data indicate that CCh activates Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation in ventricular myocytes. Because phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) is a known upstream effector of Akt, we investigated the role of PI3K to initiate Akt signaling under cholinergic stimulation. Cardiomyocytes treated with specific PI3K inhibitor wortmannin abrogated increased Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation in the presence of CCh (Fig. 4A). Moreover, wortmannin decreased RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation in the presence of CCh (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that CCh initiates parasympathetic signaling via the PI3K–Akt–NO axis to increase RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation in ventricular cardiomyocytes. Our previous work using kinase inhibitors linked PKG with CCh-induced RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation (10Ho H.-T. Belevych A.E. Liu B. Bonilla I.M. Radwański P.B. Kubasov I.V. Valdivia H.H. Schober K. Carnes C.A. Györke S. Muscarinic stimulation facilitates sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release by modulating ryanodine receptor 2 phosphorylation through protein kinase G and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.Hypertension. 2016; 68 (27647848): 1171-117810.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.116.07666Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To further establish the role of PKG as the kinase responsible for cholinergic-induced RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation, we examined the role of sGC as the putative mediator of NOS–PKG activation and PKG activation via 8-Br-cGMP. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and C), exposure of myocytes to both the specific sGC stimulator (BAY 58-2667) and 8-Br-cGMP enhanced phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808. These results indicate that PKG mediates phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808 during cholinergic stimulation. Intracellular Ca is an important secondary messenger that could support alternative or complementary pathways downstream of muscarinic receptors. To assess the role of Ca in muscarinic-dependent RyR2 phosphorylation, we used the cell-permeable Ca chelator EGTA-AM to buffer intracellular calcium levels. EGTA-AM had no significant effect on RyR2 Ser-2808 phosphorylation in response to CCh-treated or control myocytes (Fig. S4). Thus, our data support the role of Akt–PKG signaling series responsible for mediating phosphorylation of this site under cholinergic stimulation. To probe the subcellular organization of this novel muscarinic pathway, we examined other established PKG targets using Western blotting analyses. The actin modulatory protein, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), is known to be phosphorylated by PKG at serine 239 (22Sartoretto J.L. Jin B.Y. Bauer M. Gertler F.B. Liao R. Michel T. Regulation of VASP phosphorylation in cardiac myocytes: differential regulation by cyclic nucleotides and modulation of protein expression in diabetic and hypertrophic heart.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2009; 297 (19734360): 169710.1152/ajpheart.00595.2009Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, CCh increased phosphorylation of VASP Ser-239. Interestingly, VASP Ser-239 phosphorylation was independent of NOS1, suggesting subcellular specificity/compartmentalization (Fig. 6C). In cardiac myocytes, activation of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor is known to activate PKG via pGC (23Klaiber M. Kruse M. Völker K. Schröter J. Feil R. Freichel M. Gerling A. Feil S. Dietrich A. Londoño J.E. Baba H.A. Abramowitz J. Birnbaumer L. Penninger J.M.

To gain further insights into PKG signaling associated with RyR2 phosphorylation, we assessed the ability of this canonic PKG pathway to phosphorylate RyR2 Ser-2808. As demonstrated in Fig. 6E, exposure to ANP resulted in phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808. These results suggest global and more specific PKG-dependent subcellular pathways mediating phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808 and VASP Ser-239 during ANP and muscarinic stimulation, respectively. Subcellular compartmentalization of cholinergic-induced phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808 relative to VASP Ser-239 was assessed using a combination of immunofluorescence and proximity ligation assay (PLA). Whereas distribution of total RyR2 and Akt showed striated staining at Z-lines, immunoreactivity for total VASP exhibited more diffuse staining with no substantial overlap with RyR2 (Fig. S5). Differential distribution of RyR2 and VASP immunoreactivity is consistent with NOS1-dependent PKG signaling revealed in the RyR2 and VASP phosphorylation experiments above. PLA generates a punctate fluorescent signal at locations where two co-labeled proteins are within 40 nm of each other (24Fredriksson S. Gullberg M. Jarvius J. Olsson C. Pietras K. Gústafsdóttir S.M. Ostman A. Landegren U. Protein detection using proximity-dependent DNA ligation assays.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20 (11981560): 473-47710.1038/nbt0502-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). This approach was used to identify the spatial localization and distribution of phosphorylated RyR2, Akt, and VASP with a high degree of specificity. Similar to global phosphorylation seen in Western blotting experiments, CCh significantly increased spatial densities (puncta/mm2) of phosphorylated RyR2 Ser-2808 (Fig. 7A), phorylatedVASP F7 Ser-239 (Fig. 7C), and phosphorylated Akt Ser-473 (Fig. 7E) puncta/µm2. At the same time, phosphorylated RyR2 was detected with markedly higher spatial density than phosphorylated VASP (Fig. 7, A and C). This suggests that M2R-mediated RyR2 phosphorylation utilizes a more spatially extensive signaling network than VASP. Consistent with this notion, the spatial density of PLA signals corresponding to phosphorylated Akt was comparable with that of RyR2 and markedly higher than VASP (Fig. 7E). Taken together, these results suggest distinct sGC-dependent subcellular pathways mediating phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808 and VASP Ser-239. We recently demonstrated that acute muscarinic stimulation results in PKG-dependent phosphorylation of the cardiac RyR2 at serine 2808 to enhance utilization of the SR Ca store for EC coupling (10Ho H.-T. Belevych A.E. Liu B. Bonilla I.M. Radwański P.B. Kubasov I.V. Valdivia H.H. Schober K. Carnes C.A. Györke S. Muscarinic stimulation facilitates sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release by modulating ryanodine receptor 2 phosphorylation through protein kinase G and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.Hypertension. 2016; 68 (27647848): 1171-117810.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.116.07666Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to examine the specific molecular components and subcellular compartmentalization of this novel muscarinic PKG signaling mechanism. Our experiments revealed that muscarinic agonist–induced PKG phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808 involves activation of the M2R–PI3K–Akt signaling pathway with subsequent stimulation of NOS1 and generation of NO. The resultant cGMP-dependent stimulation of PKG enhances phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808. Of note, CCh-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2 was independent of myocyte Ca signaling, further underscoring the distinctive nature of this mechanism. Moreover, we report that this novel muscarinic PKG activation pathway is compartmentalized and operates in cardiomyocytes independently from muscarinic PKG–dependent phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-239. Stimulation of the ANP receptor (ANPR) resulted in concurrent PKG-dependent phosphorylation of both target proteins, RyR2 Ser-2808 and VASP Ser-239. These results suggest that RyR2 is subject to phosphorylation by PKG both locally and globally through muscarinic and ANP stimulation, respectively. Of note, the impacts of both interventions on RyR2 phosphorylation are specifically mediated by NOS1 (9Gonano L.A. Morell M. Burgos J.I. Dulce R.A. De Giusti V.C. Aiello E.A. Hare J.M. Vila Petroff M. Hypotonic swelling promotes nitric oxide release in cardiac ventricular myocytes: impact on swelling-induced negative inotropic effect.Cardiovasc. Res. 2014; 104 (25344365): 456-46610.1093/cvr/cvu230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting conversion of the two input types on the same RyR2 modulatory mechanism. Moreover, our present study demonstrated that in addition to this NO-dependent mechanism, PKG phosphorylates RyR2 Ser-2808 in a NO-independent manner through the canonical ANPR-pGC pathway. Thus, PKG phosphorylation of RyR2 Ser-2808 via NOS1 or ANPR pathways may be linked to cardio-protective signaling activated during osmotic stress and muscarinic and/or ANP stimulation. These results provide new insights into the relationship between intracellular Ca handling and cardio-protective cGMP–PKG signaling in the heart. It has been previously reported that specificity of PKG signaling in cardiomyocytes is maintained via the involvement of pGC versus sGC (14Bork N.I. Nikolaev V.O. cGMP signaling in the cardiovascular system—the role of compartmentation and its live cell imaging.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19 (29534460): 80110.3390/ijms19030801Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, our study demonstrated separate patterns of RyR2 PKG phosphorylation via ANPR and M2R, globally versus locally, respectively. Moreover, our results revealed mechanistically distinct NOS–PKG pathways targeting RyR2 and VASP. Distinct PKG signaling domains were further supported by different patterns of total RyR2 and VASP subcellular distributions (i.e. striated staining at Z-lines versus more homogeneous staining, respectively) and different spatial densities of PLA puncta for phosphorylated RyR2 and VASP. These results are also in agreement with the existence of two distinct NO pools in cardiac myocytes associated with the localization of NOS1 and NOS3 to the junctional space and caveolae, respectively (25Barouch L.A. Harrison R.W. Skaf M.W. Rosas G.O. Cappola T.P. Kobeissi Z.A. Hobai I.A. Lemmon C.A. Burnett A.L. O'Rourke B. Rodriguez E.R. Huang P.L. Lima J.A. Berkowitz D.E. Hare J.M.

Additionally, compartmentalization of phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms that are differentially modulated by PKG-mediated feedback loops (26Castro L.R. Schittl J. Fischmeister R. Feedback control through cGMP-dependent protein kinase contributes to differential regulation and compartmentation of cGMP in rat cardiac myocytes.Circ.

Previous studies have suggested that in settings of β1AR (β1-adrenergic receptor) stimulation, Akt modulates RyR2 phosphorylation in a NO-dependent manner (27Curran J. Tang L. Roof S.R. Velmurugan S. Millard A. Shonts S. Wang H. Santiago D. Ahmad U. Perryman M. Bers D.M. Mohler P.J. Ziolo M.T. Shannon T.R.

It has been demonstrated that cAMP-dependent activation of EPAC stimulates the PI3K–Akt–NOS1 pathway to facilitate NO-dependent activation of Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and enhance RyR2 phosphorylation at the CaMKII phosphorylation site RyR2 Ser-2814 (28Pereira L.

In our experiments, CCh stimulation of the Akt-NOS1 pathway was not associated with an increase in RyR2 phosphorylation at Ser-2814 (not shown) (10Ho H.-T. Belevych A.E. Liu B. Bonilla I.M.

These effects could be attributed to the fact that CaMKII activity is influenced by multiple factors, including Ca and reactive oxygen species, whose levels differ under conditions of muscarinic and adrenergic stimulation (29Gutierrez D.A. Fernandez-Tenorio M. Ogrodnik J. Niggli E. NO-dependent CaMKII activation during β-adrenergic stimulation of cardiac muscle.Cardiovasc.

However, the effects of FABP4 have not been examined in the Yanbian yellow cattle, an economically important local cattle breed in China. In this study, we characterized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FABP4 in this cattle breed and their associations with meat quality traits. Six SNPs (referred to as SNP1-6) were identified in FABP4 by direct sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The six SNPs were significantly correlated with meat quality traits. In particular, the GG and GA genotypes of SNP1 were significantly associated with water and fat contents and GG and AA genotypes of SNP1 were significantly associated with protein contents (P < 0.05). The fat content and marbling in heterozygous individuals at SNP2-6 were significantly higher than those in wild-type or mutant individuals (P < 0.05), while protein content was significantly higher in wild-type and mutant individuals than in heterozygous individuals (P < 0.05). A gene expression analysis indicated that the lipid metabolism-related genes FABP4, PPARγ, ANGPTL4, and LPL show similar expression patterns with respect to FABP4 genotypes, with the highest levels in wild-type individuals and the lowest levels in mutants. In conclusion, FABP4 SNPs can be used for marker-assisted selection in Yanbian yellow cattle breeding."

Five hundred sixty-two middle school and high school students in Physical Education classes (PE) participated in the study. Students completed questionnaires that assessed instructors’ autonomy-supportive and controlling teaching styles and students’ own fear of failure. A person-centered analysis was used to test the hypotheses. The results revealed that higher teacher autonomy support was associated with lower student fear of failure. To the contrary, a controlling teaching style was associated with fear of failure in these students. Two profiles emerged in which moderate fear of failure was associated with a stronger perception of a controlling teacher style and lower levels of fear of failure were associated with greater perceived instructor support for autonomy."

Online health communities allow patients to share questions and information about diseases. However, there have been few studies on the factors affecting online health community participation behavior in cancer patients. Online social networking is associated with mental health problems, and patients with thyroid cancer experience high levels of distress, anxiety and depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate factors associated with use of online health communities by patients with thyroid cancer to understand the characteristics of patients participating in such online communities. A questionnaire survey was completed by 114 thyroid cancer patients admitted for surgery at a general hospital in Seoul, Korea. General characteristics, clinical characteristics, attitude toward cancer, distress, and anxiety and depression scores of patients who joined an online health community (user group) and patients who did not (non-user group) were compared. The factors affecting online health community participation were education (p = 0.049), tumor size (p = 0.010), attitude toward cancer (p = 0.022), and anxiety and depression (p = 0.021). The average score of satisfaction with the online health community was 4.25 of 5. The user group had larger tumors, a high awareness of the risk of thyroid cancer, and high levels of anxiety and depression. Patients who actively used the online health community have relatively larger cancer size and had higher levels of mental stress. As such patients are often very anxious and depend heavily on the gathered information, the quality of this information is important. Healthcare professionals need to develop appropriate interventions for patients participating in the online health community."

Nineteen obesity risk reduction behaviors, self-efficacy and psychosocial constructs derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior were measured. Statistical analyses were conducted using frequency distributions, t-tests and regression analysis. Regression analysis indicated that 37.5% of the variance in obesity risk reduction behavior was accounted by self-efficacy alone. T-test comparisons indicated greater frequency of adoption of 17 health behaviors among individuals categorized in the 'high self-efficacy' group (p<0.05). These behaviors included limiting portion sizes of food, eating fruits and vegetables, engaging in physical activity, and monitoring stress and body weight.

Yet, much about the endurance of unemployment effects on workers’ careers remains poorly understood.

We apply a new dynamic measure that quantifies the quality of binary sequences, distinguishing between “good” (i.e., employment) from “bad” labor force status activities (i.e., unemployment and inactivity). We use longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) before the Great Financial Recession over the period 1984–2005 and deploy a series of hybrid models that control for unobserved heterogeneity. We find a non-linear recovery process after unemployment across gender and age groups. That is, after a period of recovery, career quality worsens. Least impacted are men experiencing unemployment when aged between 25–34 years, while men 55–66 have rather stable, though stronger, penalties. Furthermore, we find that recovery processes are contingent upon when respondents experience unemployment."

In this work, a time-series proteomic study was performed to analyse the effect of a diabetic-like microenvironment induced changes on HK-2 cells, a human cell line derived from normal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Cells simultaneously exposed to high glucose (25 mM) and hypoxia (1% O2) were compared to cells in control conditions for up to 48 h. Diabetic conditions increased the percentage of death cells after 24 and 48 h, but no differences in the protein/cell ratio were found. The relative protein quantification using dimethyl-labeling and UHPLC-MS/MS analysis allowed the identification of 317, 296 and 259 proteins at 5, 24 and 48 h, respectively. The combination of statistical and time expression profile analyses indicated an increased expression of proteins involved in glycolysis, and a decrease of cytoskeletal-related proteins. The exposure of HK-2 cells to high glucose and hypoxia reproduces some of the effects of diabetes on PTC and, with the limitations inherent to in vitro studies, propose new mechanisms and targets to be considered in the management of DKD."

The arithmetic mean surface roughness (Ra and Sa) and the surface wettability of the experimental specimens were measured. For analyzing the outermost layer of the experimental specimens, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed. Streptococcus sanguinis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, and S. mutans were used as streptococcal bacterial strains. These bacterial cultures were grown for 24 h on CpTi and TZP. The number of bacterial adhesions was estimated using an ATP-bioluminescent assay, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation of the adhered bacterial specimens was performed. No significant differences in surface roughness or wettability were found between CpTi and TZP. In XPS analyses, outermost layer of CpTi included Ti0 and Ti4+, and outermost layer of TZP included Zr4+. In the cell adhesion assay, the adherences of S. sanguinis, S. gordonii, and S. oralis to TZP were significantly lower than those to CpTi (p < 0.05); however, significant difference was not observed for S. mutans among the specimens. The adherence to CpTi and TZP of S. mutans was significantly lower than that of S. sanguinis, S. gordonii, and S. oralis. These results were confirmed by SEM. S. sanguinis, S. gordonii, and S. oralis adhered less to TZP than to CpTi, but the adherence of S. mutans was similar to both surfaces.

The effect of these statistical relationships become evident during extreme market events, such as flash crashes.In this scenario, an abrupt price swing occurring on a given market is immediately followed by anomalous movements in several related foreign exchange rates. Although a deep understanding of cross-currency correlations would be clearly beneficial for conceiving more stable and safer foreign exchange markets, the microscopic origins of these interdependencies have not been extensively investigated. We introduce an agent-based model which describes the emergence of cross-currency correlations from the interactions between market makers and an arbitrager. Our model qualitatively replicates the time-scale vs. cross-correlation diagrams observed in real trading data, suggesting that triangular arbitrage plays a primary role in the entanglement of the dynamics of different foreign exchange rates. Furthermore, the model shows how the features of the cross-correlation function between two foreign exchange rates, such as its sign and value, emerge from the interplay between triangular arbitrage and trend-following strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3037421216,"The experimental quantification and modeling of the multiaxial mechanical response of polymer membranes of coronary balloon catheters have not yet been carried out. Due to the lack of insights, it is not shown whether isotropic material models can describe the material response of balloon catheter membranes expanded with nominal or higher, supra-nominal pressures. Therefore, for the first time, specimens of commercial polyamide-12 balloon catheters membranes were investigated during uniaxial and biaxial loading scenarios. Furthermore, the influence of kinematic effects on the material response was observed by comparing results from quasi-static and dynamic biaxial extension tests. Novel clamping techniques are described, which allow to test even tiny specimens taken from the balloon membranes. The results of this study reveal the semi-compliant, nonlinear, and viscoelastic character of polyamide-12 balloon catheter membranes. Above nominal pressure, the membranes show a pronounced anisotropic mechanical behavior with a stiffer response in the circumferential direction. The anisotropic feature intensifies with an increasing strain-rate. A modified polynomial model was applied to represent the realistic mechanical response of the balloon catheter membranes during dynamic biaxial extension tests. This study also includes a compact set of constitutive model parameters for the use of the proposed model in future finite element analyses to perform more accurate simulations of expanding balloon catheters."
https://openalex.org/W3037461472,"Systems biology based approaches have been effectively utilized to mine high throughput data. In the current study, we have performed system-level analysis for Deinococcus radiodurans R1 by constructing a gene co-expression network based on several microarray datasets available in the public domain. This condition-independent network was constructed by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) with 61 microarray samples from 9 different experimental conditions. We identified 13 co-expressed modules, of which, 11 showed functional enrichments of one or more pathway/s or biological process. Comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes and proteins from radiation and desiccation stress studies with our co-expressed modules revealed the association of cyan with radiation response. Interestingly, two modules viz darkgreen and tan was associated with radiation as well as desiccation stress responses. The functional analysis of these modules showed enrichment of pathways important for adaptation of radiation or desiccation stress. To decipher the regulatory roles of these stress responsive modules, we identified transcription factors (TFs) and then calculated a Biweight mid correlation between modules hub gene and the identified TFs. We obtained 7 TFs for radiation and desiccation responsive modules. The expressions of 3 TFs were validated in response to gamma radiation using qRT-PCR. Along with the TFs, selected close neighbor genes of two important TFs, viz., DR_0997 (CRP) and DR_2287 (AsnC family transcriptional regulator) in the darkgreen module were also validated. In our network, among 13 hub genes associated with 13 modules, the functionality of 5 hub genes which are annotated as hypothetical proteins (hypothetical hub genes) in D. radiodurans genome has been revealed. Overall the study provided a better insight of pathways and regulators associated with relevant DNA damaging stress response in D. radiodurans."

In addition to public health effort to reduce obesity, there is a need to better understand the underlying biology to enable more effective treatment and the discovery of new pharmacological agents. Abhydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a serine hydrolase enzyme, localized in mitochondria, that can synthesize the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2AG) in vitro. In vivo preclinical studies demonstrated that knock-out ABHD11 mice have a similar 2AG level as WT mice and exhibit a lean metabolic phenotype. Such mice resist to weight gain in Diet Induced Obesity studies (DIO) and display normal biochemical plasma parameters. Metabolic and transcriptomic analyses on serum and tissues of ABHD11 KO mice from DIO studies show a modulation in bile salts associated with reduced fat intestinal absorption. These data suggest that modulating ABHD11 signaling pathway could be of therapeutic value for the treatment of metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3037962948,"Repeat-induced gene silencing (RIGS) establishes the centromere structure, prevents the spread of transposons and silences transgenes, thereby limiting recombinant protein production. We previously isolated a sequence (B-3-31) that alleviates RIGS from the human genome. Here, we developed an assay system for evaluating the influence of repeat sequences on gene expression, based on in vitro ligation followed by our original gene amplification technology in animal cells. Using this assay, we found that the repeat of B-3-31, three core sequences of replication initiation regions (G5, C12, and D8) and two matrix attachment regions (AR1 and 32-3), activated the co-amplified plasmid-encoded d2EGFP gene in both human and hamster cell lines. This upregulation effect persisted for up to 82 days, which was confirmed to be repeat-induced, and was thus designated as a repeat-induced gene activation (RIGA). In clear contrast, the repeat of three bacterial sequences (lambda-phage, Amp, and ColE1) and three human retroposon sequences (Alu, 5'-untranslated region, and ORF1 of a long interspersed nuclear element) suppressed gene expression, thus reflecting RIGS. RIGS was CpG-independent. We suggest that RIGA might be associated with replication initiation. The discovery of RIGS and RIGA has implications for the repeat in mammalian genome, as well as practical value in recombinant production."
https://openalex.org/W3037824495,"Background To study central hypovolemia in humans, lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is a recognized alternative to blood removal (HEM). While LBNP mimics the cardiovascular responses of HEM in baboons, similarities in hemostatic responses to LBNP and HEM remain unknown in this species. Methods Thirteen anesthetized baboons were exposed to progressive hypovolemia by HEM and, four weeks later, by LBNP. Hemostatic activity was evaluated by plasma markers, thromboelastography (TEG), flow cytometry, and platelet aggregometry at baseline (BL), during and after hypovolemia. Results BL values were indistinguishable for most parameters although platelet count, maximal clot strength (MA), protein C, thrombin anti-thrombin complex (TAT), thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activity significantly differed between HEM and LBNP. Central hypovolemia induced by either method activated coagulation; TEG R-time decreased and MA increased during and after hypovolemia compared to BL. Platelets displayed activation by flow cytometry; platelet count and functional aggregometry were unchanged. TAFI activity and protein, Factors V and VIII, vWF, Proteins C and S all demonstrated hemodilution during HEM and hemoconcentration during LBNP, whereas tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasmin/anti-plasmin complex, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 did not. Fibrinolysis (TEG LY30) was unchanged by either method; however, at BL, fibrinolysis varied greatly. Post-hoc analysis separated baboons into low-lysis (LY30 2%) whose fibrinolytic state matched at both HEM and LBNP BL. In high-lysis, BL tPA and LY30 correlated strongly (r = 0.95; P<0.001), but this was absent in low-lysis. In low-lysis, BL TAFI activity and tPA correlated (r = 0.88; P<0.050), but this was absent in high-lysis. Conclusions Central hypovolemia induced by either LBNP or HEM resulted in activation of coagulation; thus, LBNP is an adjunct to study hemorrhage-induced pro-coagulation in baboons. Furthermore, this study revealed a subset of baboons with baseline hyperfibrinolysis, which was strongly coupled to tPA and uncoupled from TAFI activity."
https://openalex.org/W3038077412,"Cognitive flexibility is the ability to switch between different concepts or to adapt goal-directed behavior in a changing environment. Although, cognitive research on this ability has long been focused on the individual mind, it is becoming increasingly clear that cognitive flexibility plays a central role in our social life. This is particularly evident in turn-taking in verbal conversation, where cognitive flexibility of the individual becomes part of social flexibility in the dyadic interaction. In this work, we introduce a model that reveals different parameters that explain how people flexibly handle unexpected events in verbal conversation. In order to study hypotheses derived from the model, we use a novel experimental approach in which thirty pairs of participants engaged in a word-by-word interaction by taking turns in generating sentences word by word. Similar to well established individual cognitive tasks, participants needed to adapt their behavior in order to respond to their co-actor's last utterance. With our experimental approach we could manipulate the interaction between participants: Either both participants had to construct a sentence with a common target word (congruent condition) or with distinct target words (incongruent condition). We further studied the relation between the interactive Word-by-Word task measures and classical individual-centered, cognitive tasks, namely the Number-Letter task, the Stop-Signal task, and the GoNogo task. In the Word-by-Word task, we found that participants had faster response times in congruent compared to incongruent trials, which replicates the primary findings of standard cognitive tasks measuring cognitive flexibility. Further, we found a significant correlation between the performance in the Word-by-Word task and the Stop-Signal task indicating that participants with a high cognitive flexibility in the Word-by-Word task also showed high inhibition control."
https://openalex.org/W3037362452,"Psittaciform orthobornaviruses are currently considered to be a major threat to the psittacine bird population worldwide. Parrot bornavirus (PaBV) was identified recently in Brazil and, since then, few studies have been conducted to understand the epidemiology of PaBV in captive psittacine birds. In the present study, natural infections by PaBV in South American parrots were investigated in two breeding facilities: commercial (A) and conservationist (B). Thirty-eight psittacine of 21 different species were presented for postmortem examination. Tissue samples were collected and investigated for the presence of PaBV-RNA using RT-PCR. In addition, clinical information about these birds was used when available. PaBV infection was detected in 73.7% of all birds investigated, indicating a wide dissemination of this virus in both facilities. From birds investigated in aviary A, 66.7% showed clinical signs, 100% had typical lesions of proventricular dilatation disease (PDD), 100% had mild to severe proventricular dilatation and 88.9% were PaBV-positive. In birds from aviary B, 27.6% showed clinical signs, 65.5% had typical lesions of PDD, 62% had mild to severe proventricular dilatation and 69% were PaBV-positive. Neurological disease was observed more frequently than gastrointestinal disease. Sequencing analysis of the matrix gene fragment revealed the occurrence of genotype 4 (PaBV-4) in both places. About 15.8% of birds in this study are threatened species. We discussed the difficulties and challenges for controlling viral spread in these aviaries and implications for South American psittacine conservation. These results emphasize the urgent need to develop a national regulatory and health standard for breeding psittacine birds in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3037931335,"Previous studies have reported movement abnormalities in persons with schizophrenia. This study aimed to examine the differences between persons with chronic schizophrenia and healthy control participants in reaching movement and the effects of sensory signals on reaching performance in persons with chronic schizophrenia. A counter-balanced repeated-measures design was employed. Twenty persons with schizophrenia and 20 age- and gender-matched control participants were recruited in this study. Reaching performance was measured in three types of sensory signal conditions (visual, auditory, and no signal), i.e., two externally triggered and one self-initiated movement were assessed in reaction time/inter-response interval, movement time, peak velocity, percentage of time in which peak velocity occurred, and movement units. The results revealed significant main effects of group in reaction time/inter-response interval (p = 0.003), movement time (p < 0.001), peak velocity (p < 0.001), and movement units (p < 0.001). The persons with chronic schizophrenia demonstrated slower response to signals and in self-initiated movement, increased movement time, and less forceful and less smooth movement compared to healthy control participants when performing the reaching task. The interaction effect between group and signal in reaction time/inter-response interval was also significant (p < 0.001). The inter-response interval for self-initiated reaching was the shortest in healthy controls. Conversely, the inter-response interval for self-initiated reaching was the longest in persons with schizophrenia. The main effect of the signal on movement time was significant (p < 0.001). The movement time of reaching was longer in response to the auditory signal than in response to visual or self-initiated. The differences in percentages of time in which peak velocity occurred between persons with schizophrenia and healthy controls (p > 0.01) and across the three conditions (p > 0.01) were non-significant. Neither duration of illness nor antipsychotic dosage was significantly associated with reaching performance (all p > 0.01). In conclusion, these findings indicate that reaching movement in persons with chronic schizophrenia is slower, less forceful, and less coordinated compared to healthy control participants. In addition, persons with chronic schizophrenia also had shorter inter-response interval for self-initiated movement and shorter movement time in auditory signal condition, independent of duration of illness and antipsychotic dosage."
