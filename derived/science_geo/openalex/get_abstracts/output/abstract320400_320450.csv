https://openalex.org/W2049462154,"The adenosine triphosphatase protein from cilia of Tetrahymena pyriformis consists of 30S and 14S fractions. The 30S fraction consists of rod-like particles, 70 to 90 angstroms in diameter, which are linear polymers of globular 14S units. The 14S units have a molecular weight of approximately 600,000. The enzymatic properties of the two fractions are similar."
https://openalex.org/W1995564968,"Almost all insulating solids, including natural minerals, glasses, and plastics, record tracks of nuclear charged particles. In this article, after first describing the nature of tracks in solids and ways of seeing them, we show how they have been used in such diverse problems as measuring the age of geological and archaeological specimens, studying the early history of the solar system recorded in meteorites, observing nuclear interactions, determining neutron fluxes, and separating biological cells of different sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2152428293,"A newly discovered population of organic walled microstructures from the Swaziland System, South Africa, is considered to be biological on the following grounds: (i) the structures are carbonaceous and occasionally have internal organic contents; (ii) the population has a narrow unimodal size frequency distribution (average diameter, 2.5 micrometers; range, 1 to 4 micrometers); (iii) the structures are not strictly spherical, but are commonly flattened and folded like younger microfossils; (iv) the sedimentary context is consistent with biogenic origins; and (v) various stages of binary division are clearly preserved."
https://openalex.org/W2027932518,"In a cell-free system, with RNA from a suppressible mutant of bacteriophage R17 as messenger,. no functional coat protein of the bacteriophage is synthesized unless serine-accepting soluble RNA from the suppressor strain, Escherichia coli S26RIE, is present."
https://openalex.org/W2012179371,Annual tree-ring chronologies from certain well-drained sites in the Hudson Valley of New York record past changes in temperature and precipitation. This information accounts for much of the July variation in Palmer drought severity indices during the period 1931 to 1970 and is used to develop a preliminary reconstruction of drought as long ago as 1728.
https://openalex.org/W2040458045,"The spermidine in rat liver increases after partial hepatectomy, and the rate of polyamine accumulation closely approximates the increased rate of synthesis of RNA in regenerating liver. The uptake by the liver of intravenously injected putrescine and the biosynthesis of spermidine are accelerated within 2 hours after the operation. The uptake of spermidine also increases during early regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2062306005,"Loss of the genetic determinant for pesticin I in Pasteurella pestis results in concomitant loss of the plague coagulase and fibrinolytic factor. The median lethal dose for mice of an isolate lacking only these activities is increased by factors of about 10(1), 10(4), and 10(7) cells when administered by the intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous routes, respectively. Virulence of the aforesaid strain can be enhanced in mice treated with 40 microg of ferrous iron. This response resembles that of Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis, a closely related species that normally lacks pesticin I."
https://openalex.org/W2057412334,"A/Jax mice treated for I week with rabbit antiserum to A/Jax lymphocytes showed peripheral lymphopenia and tissue lymphocyte depletion which persisted for 4 weeks after initiation of serum treatment. During this time, such animals showed depression of the humoral antibody response and inability to reject skin allografts. After 4 weeks, mice recovered from effects of serum treatment. Normal blood and tissue lymphocyte levels returned, and immunologic competence was restored. Thymectomy of A/Jax mice (8 to 10 weeks old) prior to serum treatment resulted in peripheral and tissue lymphopenia and depression of antibody formation, which persisted twice as long as that shown by animals given serum alone. Similarly, skin allografts survive two to four times longer in serum-treated thymectomized mice, and, in some cases persisted over 100 days in perfect condition."
https://openalex.org/W2048995381,"The discovery and characterization of structurally ordered and disordered phases that are intermediate between amphiboles and micas have shown that the biopyriboles are a much more complex family of minerals than has previously been recognized. In addition to single-chain, double-chain, and sheet structures, there are also minerals with triple chains and with alternating double and triple chains. Many crystals exhibit disorder in the sequence of double and triple chains, and isolated chains that are wider than triple are common. This structural disorder helps to explain why asbestiform amphiboles are fibrous. The new phases have now been found in several localities, and it is possible that similar phenomena in other minerals could also have been overlooked. In particular, there is no reason to suppose that analogous substances and structures with both single and double chains do not occur between the pyroxenes and the amphiboles. Since the pyroxenes are used extensively by geologists to assess rock histories and formation temperatures and pressures, it is essential that the extent of this type of disorder be evaluated. It is possible that what appears to be only an interesting mineralogical problem may prove to be a petrological nightmare."
https://openalex.org/W2055260925,"Electrical stimulation of the amygdala of cats, evoking a defense reaction, was associated with a reduction in the noradrenalin content of the brain and adrenal glands but not in the dopamine content of the brain. When stimulation resulted in quieting or sleep, catecholamine concentrations were unaflected. Changes in brain noradrenalin, therefore, appear related to production of the defense response and not to nonspecific amygdalofugal pathway excitation."
https://openalex.org/W2028250029,The internal electrical potential of protoplasts from six different plant species was positive. Plasmolyzed cells of leaves had positive voltages of similar magnitude. Both Elodea leaf cells and tobacco protoplasts with regenerated cell walls became more electronegative during deplasmolysis. These findings suggest that cell turgor affects membrane components that determine cellular potential.
https://openalex.org/W1983559246,"Contrary to a recent report, destruction of the medial hypothalamus by electrocauterization with radio-frequency current consistently produced overeating and obesity in rats. This confirms the earlier consensus that destruction in the region of the ventromedial hypothalamus releases feeding from normal inhibition. In addition to augmenting feeding, the same lesions increased the rate of lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation after food satiation had depressed it. Thus the medial hypothalamus, when intact, inhibits both feeding and lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2076375297,The low-power electricglow discharge in helium can excite efftctively the characteristic emission lines of sodium and potassium. The helium-glow photometer used to generate the glow and measure the light is a relatively simple apparatus; it can be used to analyze samples containing 10(-14) mole or more of sodium and potassium. Overall precision of the apparatus and method is 5 percent or better.
https://openalex.org/W2049991345,"Peptide analyses have been carried out for chymotryptic digests of transferrin C and transferrin D1. There is a difference in one peptide, and amino acid analyses indicate that an aspartic acid residue in transferrin C is replaced probably by a glycine residue in transferrin D1."
https://openalex.org/W2011214573,"Nagy's report of an optical rotation of-0.023 degrees to -0.084 degrees in the Orgueil meteorite has not been confirmed. The highest rotation found in several fatty-acid and hydrocarbon fractions isolated from the meteorite was -0.002 degrees , less than that of optically inactive controls. The ""rotations"" observed by Nagy may have been caused by scattered depolarized light from colloidal particles, reduced instrument sensitivity due to low transmittance of the solutions, or a combination of both."
https://openalex.org/W2045895685,"A specific fluorescence is developed in melanocytes, nevus cells, and cells of malignant melanoma by treatment of the tissue with dry formaldehyde gas. The fluorescence is often stronger in melanocytes adjacent to nevi or melanomas than in normal melanocytes. The strongest fluorescence occurs in cells of malignant melanoma. Among the limited number of compounds that condense with formaldehyde to fluorescent derivatives, DOPA [beta(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)L-alanine] seems the most likely substance to give rise to the fluorescence observed in these lesions."

https://openalex.org/W2094387208,"Experiments with intact or lysed spheroplasts from Escherichia coli indicate that conditions which impair the DNA-directed synthesis of RNA, also prevent formation of pseudouridine. Studies with uridine-labeled RNA support the concept that RNA may be a direct intermediate for pseudouridine synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2052121116,"In the larva of the butterfly Calpodes ethlius, molt and intermolt syntheses by the epidermis are each preceded by a phase of RNA synthesis. Endocuticle deposition and the secretion of wax are not controlled only by the molting hormone when they take place during the intermolt period."
https://openalex.org/W1963928173,"Measurable quantities of iron-55 are present in people, animals, and food. The amount in Eskimos and caribou at Anaktuvuk, Alaska, is about eight times that in residents and cattle near Richland, Washington. Meat and grains are the foods that contribute most to the body burdens of iron-55 in human beings."
https://openalex.org/W2058581268,The various biostratigraphic boundaries proposed for the base of the Pleistocene are not necessarily synchronous with the onset of continental glaciation. Electron-microscopic examination of surface textures of sand grains suggests a widely applicable rock-stratigraphic and geologic-climate boundary that may mark the point at which glaciers of continental proportions began to launch debris-carrying icebergs into the world's oceans.
https://openalex.org/W1974346888,Polygenic mutations were induced in an inbred strain of Tribolium confusum by exposure to 500 roentgens of gamma radiation. Female progeny of irradiated males bearing induced mutations in the heterozygous state produced significantly more viable offspring than control female progeny of nonirradiated males.
https://openalex.org/W2011429591,Spontaneous drug-seeking behavior was established in 3 out of 4 rhesus monkeys that were given unrestricted access to morphine and placebo solutions. The monkeys were kept in their home cages throughout the experiment and were not subjected to conditions of stress; prior addiction was not established by the usual injection procedures. The animals became physically dependent on the drug and showed abstinence symptoms when injected intramuscularly with nalorphine (N-allyl normorphine hydrochloride). This method may be useful for studying individual differences in susceptibility to drug abuse.
https://openalex.org/W1986269211,"Primary intracellular symbiotes of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), when fixed with potassium permanganate, revealed a distinctly staining area between the cytoplasmic membrane and the outer cell-wall envelope. This area is thought to be analogous to the peptidoglycan complex of the Eubacteriales. In addition, the diagnostic bacterial peptidoglycan amino compounds, muramic acid and diaminopimelic acid, were detected in a hydrochloric acid hydrolyzate of isolated symbiotes."
