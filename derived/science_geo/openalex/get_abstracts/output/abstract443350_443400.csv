https://openalex.org/W2061965920,"Cell-type plasticity within a tumor has recently been suggested to cause a bidirectional conversion between tumor-initiating stem cells and nonstem cells triggered by an inflammatory stroma. NF-κB represents a key transcription factor within the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. However, NF-κB's function in tumor-initiating cells has not been examined yet. Using a genetic model of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-restricted constitutive Wnt-activation, which comprises the most common event in the initiation of colon cancer, we demonstrate that NF-κB modulates Wnt signaling and show that IEC-specific ablation of RelA/p65 retards crypt stem cell expansion. In contrast, elevated NF-κB signaling enhances Wnt activation and induces dedifferentiation of nonstem cells that acquire tumor-initiating capacity. Thus, our data support the concept of bidirectional conversion and highlight the importance of inflammatory signaling for dedifferentiation and generation of tumor-initiating cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2107458751,"MDA5, a viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) receptor, shares sequence similarity and signaling pathways with RIG-I yet plays essential functions in antiviral immunity through distinct specificity for viral RNA. Revealing the molecular basis for the functional divergence, we report here the crystal structure of MDA5 bound to dsRNA, which shows how, using the same domain architecture, MDA5 recognizes the internal duplex structure, whereas RIG-I recognizes the terminus of dsRNA. We further show that MDA5 uses direct protein-protein contacts to stack along dsRNA in a head-to-tail arrangement, and that the signaling domain (tandem CARD), which decorates the outside of the core MDA5 filament, also has an intrinsic propensity to oligomerize into an elongated structure that activates the signaling adaptor, MAVS. These data support a model in which MDA5 uses long dsRNA as a signaling platform to cooperatively assemble the core filament, which in turn promotes stochastic assembly of the tandem CARD oligomers for signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1997891554,"About half of the satellites in the Andromeda galaxy (M 31), all with the same sense of rotation about their host, form a planar subgroup that is extremely wide but also very thin. Giant spiral galaxies are assembled from smaller systems through a process known as hierarchical clustering. In orbit around these giants are dwarf galaxies, which are presumably remnants of the galactic progenitors. Recent studies of the dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way have led some astronomers to suspect that their orbits are not randomly distributed. This suspicion, which challenges current theories of galaxy formation, is now bolstered by the discovery of a plane of dwarf galaxies corotating as a coherent pancake-like structure around the Andromeda galaxy, the Milky Way's close neighbour and in many respects its 'twin'. The structure is extremely thin yet contains about half of the dwarf galaxies in the Andromeda system. The authors report that 13 of the 15 satellites in the plane share the same sense of rotation. Dwarf satellite galaxies are thought to be the remnants of the population of primordial structures that coalesced to form giant galaxies like the Milky Way1. It has previously been suspected2 that dwarf galaxies may not be isotropically distributed around our Galaxy, because several are correlated with streams of H i emission, and may form coplanar groups3. These suspicions are supported by recent analyses4,5,6,7. It has been claimed7 that the apparently planar distribution of satellites is not predicted within standard cosmology8, and cannot simply represent a memory of past coherent accretion. However, other studies dispute this conclusion9,10,11. Here we report the existence of a planar subgroup of satellites in the Andromeda galaxy (M 31), comprising about half of the population. The structure is at least 400 kiloparsecs in diameter, but also extremely thin, with a perpendicular scatter of less than 14.1 kiloparsecs. Radial velocity measurements12,13,14,15 reveal that the satellites in this structure have the same sense of rotation about their host. This shows conclusively that substantial numbers of dwarf satellite galaxies share the same dynamical orbital properties and direction of angular momentum. Intriguingly, the plane we identify is approximately aligned with the pole of the Milky Way’s disk and with the vector between the Milky Way and Andromeda."

https://openalex.org/W2014849583,"Observations of the young star HD 142527, whose disk is separated into inner and outer regions by a gap suggestive of the formation of a gaseous giant planet, show that accretion onto the star is maintained by a flow of gas across the gap, in agreement with dynamical models of planet formation. According to current theories, giant planet formation carves a deep gap in the gas and dust around a protostar, clearing most of the dust and some of the gas away to form a ring-shaped cavity. But such a gap would rapidly turn off further growth in the mass of the star unless the abundant gas from the outer disk could traverse it. This paper presents Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the disk around the young star HD 142527 that reveal diffuse CO inside the gap and denser HCO+ gas along gap-crossing filaments. The estimated gas flow across the gap would be sufficient to maintain accretion onto the star at the present rate. The formation of gaseous giant planets is thought to occur in the first few million years after stellar birth. Models1 predict that the process produces a deep gap in the dust component (shallower in the gas2,3,4). Infrared observations of the disk around the young star HD 142527 (at a distance of about 140 parsecs from Earth) found an inner disk about 10 astronomical units (au) in radius5 (1 au is the Earth–Sun distance), surrounded by a particularly large gap6 and a disrupted7 outer disk beyond 140 au. This disruption is indicative of a perturbing planetary-mass body at about 90 au. Radio observations8,9 indicate that the bulk mass is molecular and lies in the outer disk, whose continuum emission has a horseshoe morphology8. The high stellar accretion rate10 would deplete the inner disk11 in less than one year, and to sustain the observed accretion matter must therefore flow from the outer disk and cross the gap. In dynamical models, the putative protoplanets channel outer-disk material into gap-crossing bridges that feed stellar accretion through the inner disk12. Here we report observations of diffuse CO gas inside the gap, with denser HCO+ gas along gap-crossing filaments. The estimated flow rate of the gas is in the range of 7 × 10−9 to 2 × 10−7 solar masses per year, which is sufficient to maintain accretion onto the star at the present rate."
https://openalex.org/W2063017515,"It was proposed that protein kinase M-ζ (PKM-ζ) is a key factor in long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory maintenance on the basis of the disruption of LTP and memory by inhibitors of PKM-ζ; however, here mice that do not express PKM-ζ are shown to have normal LTP and memory, thus casting doubts on a critical role for PKM-ζ in these processes. Long-term potentiation (LTP), a persistent enhancement of signalling between nerve cells, has long been considered the likely cellular correlate of memory, but only now are the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of LTP beginning to emerge. Some time ago, it was proposed that sustained activity of protein kinase M-ζ (PKM-ζ) may be a key factor in sustaining LTP, based mainly on experiments using pharmacological inhibitors. Two groups have now engineered mice lacking PKM-ζ to test more directly for its role in LTP and memory. Studies from the labs of Richard Huganir and Robert Messing find that loss of PKM-ζ has no effect on LTP or memory formation. And despite the absence of this kinase, pharmacological inhibitors of PKM-ζ still disrupt memory in these mutant mice. These data cast doubt on the role of PKM-ζ in LTP maintenance and re-open the exploration for key molecules regulating long-term plasticity. Long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-characterized form of synaptic plasticity, has long been postulated as a cellular correlate of learning and memory. Although LTP can persist for long periods of time1, the mechanisms underlying LTP maintenance, in the midst of ongoing protein turnover and synaptic activity, remain elusive. Sustained activation of the brain-specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoform protein kinase M-ζ (PKM-ζ) has been reported to be necessary for both LTP maintenance and long-term memory2. Inhibiting PKM-ζ activity using a synthetic zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) based on the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate sequence reverses established LTP in vitro and in vivo3,4. More notably, infusion of ZIP eliminates memories for a growing list of experience-dependent behaviours, including active place avoidance4, conditioned taste aversion5, fear conditioning and spatial learning6. However, most of the evidence supporting a role for PKM-ζ in LTP and memory relies heavily on pharmacological inhibition of PKM-ζ by ZIP. To further investigate the involvement of PKM-ζ in the maintenance of LTP and memory, we generated transgenic mice lacking PKC-ζ and PKM-ζ. We find that both conventional and conditional PKC-ζ/PKM-ζ knockout mice show normal synaptic transmission and LTP at Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapses, and have no deficits in several hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks. Notably, ZIP still reverses LTP in PKC-ζ/PKM-ζ knockout mice, indicating that the effects of ZIP are independent of PKM-ζ."

These data cast doubt on the role of PKM-ζ in LTP maintenance and re-open the exploration for key molecules regulating long-term plasticity. Protein kinase M-ζ (PKM-ζ) is a constitutively active form of atypical protein kinase C that is exclusively expressed in the brain and implicated in the maintenance of long-term memory1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Most studies that support a role for PKM-ζ in memory maintenance have used pharmacological PKM-ζ inhibitors such as the myristoylated zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) or chelerythrine. Here we use a genetic approach and target exon 9 of the Prkcz gene to generate mice that lack both protein kinase C-ζ (PKC-ζ) and PKM-ζ (Prkcz−/− mice). Prkcz−/− mice showed normal behaviour in a cage environment and in baseline tests of motor function and sensory perception, but displayed reduced anxiety-like behaviour. Notably, Prkcz−/− mice did not show deficits in learning or memory in tests of cued fear conditioning, novel object recognition, object location recognition, conditioned place preference for cocaine, or motor learning, when compared with wild-type littermates. ZIP injection into the nucleus accumbens reduced expression of cocaine-conditioned place preference in Prkcz−/− mice. In vitro, ZIP and scrambled ZIP inhibited PKM-ζ, PKC-ι and PKC-ζ with similar inhibition constant (Ki) values. Chelerythrine was a weak inhibitor of PKM-ζ (Ki = 76 μM). Our findings show that absence of PKM-ζ does not impair learning and memory in mice, and that ZIP can erase reward memory even when PKM-ζ is not present."

We studied the role of Yap1 in maintaining basal cardiac function and in modulating injury after chronic myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiomyocyte-specific homozygous inactivation of Yap1 in the postnatal heart (YapF/FCre) elicited increased myocyte apoptosis and fibrosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and premature death. Heterozygous deletion (Yap+/FCre) did not cause an overt cardiac phenotype compared with YapF/F control mice at base line. In response to stress (MI), nuclear Yap1 was found selectively in the border zone and not in the remote area of the heart. After chronic MI (28 days), Yap+/FCre mice had significantly increased myocyte apoptosis and fibrosis, with attenuated compensatory cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and further impaired function versus Yap+/F control mice. Studies in isolated cardiomyocytes demonstrated that Yap1 expression is sufficient to promote increased cell size and hypertrophic gene expression and protected cardiomyocytes against H2O2-induced cell death, whereas Yap1 depletion attenuated phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy and augmented apoptosis. Finally, we observed a significant decrease in cardiomyocyte proliferation in Yap+/FCre hearts compared with Yap+/F controls after MI and demonstrated that Yap1 is sufficient to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation in isolated cardiomyocytes.

The aim of this study was to determine the physiological role of Yap1 in maintaining cardiac homeostasis as well as its function in responding to chronic myocardial ischemia in the adult mouse. To achieve this aim we utilized bigenic mice harboring a floxed Yap1 allele and inactivated gene expression selectively in cardiomyocytes in the postnatal heart by breeding with α-MHC Cre transgenic animals. Generation of transgenic mice harboring a floxed Yap1 allele (C57BL/6 background) and α-MHC Cre recombinase transgenic mice (C57BL/6 background) has been previously reported (10Zhang N. Bai H.

Pathogen-free mice were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with 12 h of light/dark cycles where they received food and water ad libitum. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg). A rodent ventilator (model 683; Harvard Apparatus Inc.) was used with 65% oxygen during the surgical procedure. The animals were kept warm using heat lamps and heating pads. Rectal temperature was monitored and maintained between 36.5 and 37.5 °C. The chest was opened by a horizontal incision through the muscle between the ribs (third intercostal space). Ischemia was achieved by permanent ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery (LAD) using an 8-0 nylon suture with a silicon tubing (1 mm OD) placed on top of the LAD 2 mm below the border between left atrium and left ventricle (LV). Regional ischemia was confirmed by ECG change (S-wave/T-wave segment elevation). After 2 days or 4 weeks of ligation, the heart was perfused with saline. The size of infarct at 4 weeks was determined as previously described (14Odashima M. Usui S. Takagi H. Hong C. Liu J. Yokota M. Sadoshima J. Inhibition of endogenous Mst1 prevents apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction without affecting cardiac hypertrophy after myocardial infarction.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, the LV was cut into four transverse slices (1-mm thick), subjected to Masson's Trichrome staining, and mounted. The length of the circumference in the infarct portion and the normal area was obtained from each of the 4 LV slices. Infarct size at 2 days was determined using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride as described (15Sciarretta S. Zhai P. Shao D. Maejima Y. Robbins J. Volpe M. Condorelli G. Sadoshima J.

Ventricular cardiomyocytes were prepared from 1-day-old Crl: (WI) BR Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories). A cardiomyocyte-rich fraction was obtained by centrifugation through a discontinuous Percoll gradient. Cells were cultured in a complete medium (cardiomyocyte) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 4 μg/ml transferrin, 0.7 ng/ml sodium selenite (Invitrogen), 2 g/liter bovine serum albumin (fraction V), 3 mmol/liter pyruvic acid, 15 mmol/liter HEPES, 100 μmol/liter ascorbic acid, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 5 μg/ml linoleic, acid and 100 μmol/liter 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma). The inhibitors LY294002, PD98059, and Akt inhibitor V (triciribine) were obtained from EMD, Calbiochem. Phenylephrine was purchased from Sigma. Recombinant adenovirus vectors were constructed, propagated, and titered as previously described (17Yamamoto S. Yang G. Zablocki D. Liu J. Hong C. Kim S.J. Soler S. Odashima M. Thaisz J. Yehia G.

Briefly, pBHGloxΔE1,3Cre (Microbix), including the ΔE1 adenoviral genome, was co-transfected with the pDC shuttle vector containing the gene of interest into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Through homologous recombination, the test genes were integrated into the E1-deleted adenoviral genome. The viruses were propagated in HEK293 cells. We made replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 (devoid of E1) harboring Yap1. Adenovirus harboring β-galactosidase (LacZ) was used as a control. pSilencer 1.0-U6 expression vector was purchased from Ambion. The U6 RNA polymerase III promoter and the polylinker region were subcloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector pDC316 (Microbix). The hairpin-forming oligo, corresponding to bases 553–572 of the rat yap1 cDNA, and its antisense with ApaI and HindIII overhangs were synthesized, annealed, and subcloned distal to the U6 promoter. Heart specimens were fixed with formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 6-μm thickness. Interstitial fibrosis was evaluated by Masson's Trichrome staining (16Matsui Y. Nakano N. Shao D.

Briefly, deparaffinized sections were incubated with proteinase K, and DNA fragments were labeled with fluorescein-conjugated dUTP using TdT (Roche Applied Science). Nuclear density was determined by manual counting of DAPI-stained nuclei in six fields for each animal using the 40× objective, and the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei was counted by examining the entire section using the same power objective. DNA fragmentation was detected in cultured cells using TUNEL as described previously (17Yamamoto S. Yang G. Zablocki D. Liu J. Hong C. Kim S.J. Soler S. Odashima M. Thaisz J. Yehia G. Molina C.A.

Invest. 2003; 111: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Nuclear density was determined by counting DAPI-stained nuclei in 20 different fields for each sample. Cardiomyocytes were transduced with LacZ or Yap1 adenovirus and treated with H2O2 (100 μm) or vehicle for 2 h. Propidium iodide (500 nm) was added to the culture medium for 10 min before DAPI counterstain and fluorescent imaging. After treatment, cardiomyocytes were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. The cardiomyocyte surface area was measured using troponin T-stained cardiomyocytes, and NIH Image J. Troponin T was detected with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Activity of the ANF promoter was evaluated using ANF-luciferase reporter plasmid (ANF-Luc) as described (16Matsui Y. Nakano N. Shao D. Gao S. Luo W. Hong C. Zhai P. Holle E. Yu X. Yabuta N. Tao W.

Ventricular tissue and cardiomyocytes were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. For immunoblotting, antibodies against Akt, phospho-AktSer-473, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3β), phospho-GSK-3βSer-9, Yap1, phospho-YapSer-127, ERK, phospho-ERKThr-202/Tyr-204, cleaved caspase-3, FLAG, and GAPDH were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Phospho-Lats2Ser-872 antibody was generated previously as described (18Yabuta N. Okada N. Ito A. Hosomi T. Nishihara S. Sasayama Y. Fujimori A. Okuzaki D. Zhao H. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Nojima H.

Lats2 antibody was purchased from Bethyl Laboratories. TEAD1/TEF antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Tubulin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Heart sections or cardiomyocytes were stained with anti-Ki-67 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Vector Laboratories), anti-phospho(Ser-10)-histone H3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), anti-Yap1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), anti-troponin-T mouse monoclonal antibody (Neomarkers), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen), and Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Analyses were performed using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss). Total cardiomyocyte numbers were estimated using a published method (19Beltrami A.P. Urbanek K. Kajstura J. Yan S.M. Finato N. Bussani R. Nadal-Ginard B. Silvestri F. Leri A. Beltrami C.A. Anversa P. Evidence that human cardiac myocytes divide after myocardial infarction.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1750-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Briefly, the number of nuclei per unit area of myocardium (N(n)A) was determined in 20 fields (40×). The average nuclear length (Dn) was determined in longitudinally oriented myocytes. The number of myocyte nuclei per unit volume of myocardium (N(n)V) was calculated using the equation N(n)V = N(n)A/Dn. The estimated total number of myocyte nuclei in the LV was calculated as the product of the number of myocyte nuclei per unit volume, N(n)V and the total ventricular volume, which was derived from the LV weight using the specific gravity of muscle tissue, 1.06 g/ml. All values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by either t test or analysis of variance and the Tukey post-test procedure, with p < 0.05 considered significant. To determine the effect of postnatal deletion of Yap1 in the heart, we inactivated a conditional Yap1 allele (YapF/F) (10Zhang N. Bai H. David K.K. Dong J. Zheng Y. Cai J. Giovannini M. Liu P.

Depletion of Yap1 protein levels was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using ventricular tissue from adult Yap+/FCre, YapF/FCre, and control YapF/F mice (Fig. 1A). We also determined the specificity of Yap1 disruption and found that Yap1 protein expression was unaffected in other tissues (Fig. 1B). Baseline gravimetric analysis was performed on 8 week-old male mice. We observed a significant increase in both heart weight and LV weight normalized to tibia length in the YapF/FCre mice compared with controls, whereas no difference between Yap+/FCre and control mice was evident (Fig. 1, C and D). The lung weight-to-tibia length ratio was also significantly increased in YapF/FCre mice, suggesting pulmonary congestion (Fig. 1E). To determine differences in cardiac geometry and function, echocardiography was performed. No significant differences in heart shape or function were present between YapF/F and Yap+/FCre mice; however, YapF/FCre mice demonstrated clear septal and posterior wall thinning as well as chamber dilation compared with control mice (Table 1). Furthermore, myocardial function, as determined by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (FS), was strikingly reduced in YapF/FCre mice (Fig. 1F, Table 1). Ultimately, the YapF/FCre mice died prematurely due to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, with a median lifespan between 10 and 11 weeks (Fig. 1, G and H). No difference in survival was observed between YapF/F and Yap+/FCre mice.TABLE 1Base-line echocardiographic analysis of 8-week-old Yap1-deficient miceParameterYapF/FYap+/FCreYapF/FCren9105DSEP WT (mm)0.64 ± 0.050.55 ± 0.060.55 ± 0.09LVEDD (mm)3.52 ± 0.113.56 ± 0.114.85 ± 0.42ap < 0.05 versus YapF/F control mice.DPWT (mm)0.79 ± 0.050.65 ± 0.040.59 ± 0.08ap < 0.05 versus YapF/F control mice.SSEP WT (mm)1.14 ± 0.100.88 ± 0.08ap < 0.05 versus YapF/F control mice.0.66 ± 0.07ap < 0.05 versus YapF/F control mice.LVESD (mm)2.30 ± 0.102.48 ± 0.144.14 ± 0.45ap < 0.05 versus YapF/F control mice.SPWT (mm)1.10 ± 0.060.84 ± 0.04ap < 0.05 versus YapF/F control mice.0.60 ± 0.11ap < 0.05 versus YapF/F control mice.LVEF (%)71.6 ± 2.865.8 ± 2.926.7 ± 7.3ap < 0.05 versus YapF/F control mice.%FS34.5 ± 1.930.6 ± 2.010.3 ± 3.1ap < 0.05 versus YapF/F control mice.HR451 ± 27478 ± 27419 ± 22BW (g)24.2 ± 1.122.9 ± 0.921.9 ± 1.4a p < 0.05 versus YapF/F control mice. Open table in a new tab Histological analysis revealed a robust increase in myocardial fibrosis in 8-week-old YapF/FCre mice, whereas no significant difference between Yap+/FCre and control mice was observed at base line (Fig. 2, A–C). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was also determined by TUNEL. We found no difference in TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes present between YapF/F and Yap+/FCre heart sections. On the other hand, there was a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes present in YapF/FCre hearts at base line (Fig. 2, D and E). To determine whether the increase in YapF/FCre LV weight was a result of increased growth of individual myocytes, we stained heart sections with wheat germ agglutinin and analyzed the cross-sectional area (CSA) for each group. We found no significant difference between Yap+/FCre and YapF/F control hearts; however, relative myocyte CSA was significantly increased in YapF/FCre mice (Fig. 2, F and G). Yap1 is an important promoter of cardiomyocyte proliferation in the developing embryonic heart (11Xin M. Kim Y. Sutherland L.B. Qi X. McAnally J. Schwartz R.J. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R.

Hippo pathway inhibits Wnt signaling to restrain cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart size.Science. 2011; 332: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also investigated the effect of postnatal Yap1 deletion on cardiomyocyte proliferation. We determined the number of cardiomyocytes present in hearts from YapF/F, Yap+/FCre, and YapF/FCre mice and found no significant difference between the three groups (Fig. 2H). Taken together, our base-line characterization indicates that adult mice with heterozygous Yap1 deletion in cardiomyocytes showed no significant difference in heart size or function compared with YapF/F control mice, but that homozygous deletion of cardiomyocyte Yap1 caused significant increases in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis, leading to ventricular remodeling associated with severely impaired cardiac function and premature death. Yap1 is a transcriptional coactivator; therefore, we reasoned that gene expression is likely altered in hearts deficient for Yap1. To test this hypothesis, we performed a PCR-based and apoptosis-focused gene expression array (SA Biosciences; Ref. 21Del Re D.P. Matsuda T. Zhai P. Gao S. Clark G.J. Van Der Weyden L. Sadoshima J. Proapoptotic Rassf1A/Mst1 signaling in cardiac fibroblasts is protective against pressure overload in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 3555-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) using ventricular homogenates from 8-week-old YapF/F and YapF/FCre mice. We observed a striking down-regulation of Akt1 expression in the YapF/FCre heart. To confirm this, we performed immunoblots using YapF/F, Yap+/FCre, and YapF/FCre hearts and found a dose-dependent decrease in both total and phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 3A). To determine the effect of Yap1 expression in vitro, we engineered adenovirus to overexpress Yap1 (2–3-fold) in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. We then transduced cardiomyocytes with Yap1 or LacZ control and performed quantitative real-time-PCR to detect mRNA expression of Akt1 and Akt2. We found that Yap1 expression significantly increased Akt1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3B). Consistent with these results, Yap1 expression also caused an increase in total Akt protein levels and Akt activation, the latter being sensitive to PI3K inhibition (Fig. 3, C and D). On the other hand, no change in ERK activation or expression was observed in Yap1 mutant hearts or in cardiomyocytes transduced with Yap1 adenovirus (Fig. 3, A, C, and D). Akt is an established protective molecule in many cell types including cardiomyocytes (22Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J.

The lobes are largely coincident with the 'Fermi bubbles', recently discovered regions of γ-ray emission reaching far above and below the Galactic Centre. The radio lobes are permeated by strong magnetic fields, and appear to originate as a biconical outflow driven by star formation rather than by a black hole. The nucleus of the Milky Way is known to harbour regions of intense star formation activity as well as a supermassive black hole1. Recent observations have revealed regions of γ-ray emission reaching far above and below the Galactic Centre (relative to the Galactic plane), the so-called ‘Fermi bubbles’2. It is uncertain whether these were generated by nuclear star formation or by quasar-like outbursts of the central black hole3,4,5,6 and no information on the structures’ magnetic field has been reported. Here we report observations of two giant, linearly polarized radio lobes, containing three ridge-like substructures, emanating from the Galactic Centre. The lobes each extend about 60 degrees in the Galactic bulge, closely corresponding to the Fermi bubbles, and are permeated by strong magnetic fields of up to 15 microgauss. We conclude that the radio lobes originate in a biconical, star-formation-driven (rather than black-hole-driven) outflow from the Galaxy’s central 200 parsecs that transports a huge amount of magnetic energy, about 1055 ergs, into the Galactic halo. The ridges wind around this outflow and, we suggest, constitute a ‘phonographic’ record of nuclear star formation activity over at least ten million years."
https://openalex.org/W1996302662,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) senses stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and initiates signal transduction cascades that culminate in changes to gene regulation. Long recognized as a means for improving ER protein folding through up-regulation of ER chaperones, the UPR is increasingly recognized to play a role in the regulation of metabolic pathways. ER stress is clearly connected to altered metabolism in tissues such as the liver, but the mechanisms underlying this connection are only beginning to be elucidated. Here, working exclusively in vivo, we tested the hypothesis that the UPR-regulated CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) participates in the transcriptional regulation of metabolism during hepatic ER stress. We found that metabolic dysregulation was associated with induction of eIF2α signaling and CHOP up-regulation during challenge with tunicamycin or Velcade. CHOP was necessary for suppression of genes encoding the transcriptional master regulators of lipid metabolism: Cebpa, Ppara, and Srebf1. This action of CHOP required a contemporaneous CHOP-independent stress signal. CHOP bound directly to C/EBP-binding regions in the promoters of target genes, whereas binding of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ to the same regions was diminished during ER stress. Our results thus highlight a role for CHOP in the transcriptional regulation of metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1998546480,"Enhancers play a central role in precisely regulating the expression of developmentally regulated genes. However, the machineries required for enhancer-promoter communication have remained largely unknown. We have found that Ell3, a member of the Ell (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia gene) family of RNA Pol II elongation factors, occupies enhancers in embryonic stem cells. Ell3's association with enhancers is required for setting up proper Pol II occupancy at the promoter-proximal regions of developmentally regulated genes and for the recruitment of the super elongation complex (SEC) to these loci following differentiation signals. Furthermore, Ell3 binding to inactive or poised enhancers is essential for stem cell specification. We have also detected the presence of Pol II and Ell3 in germ cell nuclei. These findings raise the possibility that transcription factors could prime gene expression by marking enhancers in ES cells or even as early as in the germ cell state."

https://openalex.org/W1969940696,"Mitochondrial superoxide flashes reflect a quantal, bursting mode of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that arises from stochastic, transient opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in many types of cells and in living animals. However, the regulatory mechanisms and the exact nature of the flash-coupled mPTP remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate a profound synergistic effect between mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniport and elevated basal ROS production in triggering superoxide flashes in intact cells. Hyperosmotic stress potently augmented the flash activity while simultaneously elevating mitochondrial Ca(2+) and ROS. Blocking mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport by knockdown of MICU1 or MCU, newly identified components of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter, or scavenging mitochondrial basal ROS markedly diminished the flash response. More importantly, whereas elevating Ca(2+) or ROS production alone was inefficacious in triggering the flashes, concurrent physiological Ca(2+) and ROS elevation served as the most powerful flash activator, increasing the flash incidence by an order of magnitude. Functionally, superoxide flashes in response to hyperosmotic stress participated in the activation of JNK and p38. Thus, physiological levels of mitochondrial Ca(2+) and ROS synergistically regulate stochastic mPTP opening and quantal ROS production in intact cells, marking the flash as a coincidence detector of mitochondrial Ca(2+) and ROS signals."

Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes the diarrheal disease cholera in humans. This organism colonizes human small intestine and produces a potent enterotoxin called cholera toxin, which is primarily responsible for the diarrheal syndromes (1Nelson E.J. Harris J.B. Morris Jr., J.G. Calderwood S.B. Camilli A. Cholera transmission: the host, pathogen and bacteriophage dynamic.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Cholera is considered a prototypical noninflammatory toxigenic diarrhea. However, acute V. cholerae O1 infection triggers mucosal innate immune responses with infiltration of neutrophils, degranulation of mast cells and eosinophils, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines (2Qadri F. Bhuiyan T.R. Dutta K.K. Raqib R. Alam M.S. Alam N.H. Svennerholm A.M. Mathan M.M.

In addition, in vivo studies suggest significant up-regulation of proinflammatory molecules and inflammatory cells in the duodenal tissue of cholera patients (3Qadri F. Raqib R. Ahmed F. Rahman T. Wenneras C. Das S.K. Alam N.H. Mathan M.M. Svennerholm A.M. Increased levels of inflammatory mediators in children and adults infected with Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139.Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2002; 9: 221-229PubMed Google Scholar). At the molecular level, the pathogenesis of cholera is a multifactorial process and involves several genes encoding virulence factors that aid the pathogen in its colonization, coordinated expression of virulence factors, and toxin action (4Sánchez J. Holmgren J. Virulence factors, pathogenesis and vaccine protection in cholera and ETEC diarrhea.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).

OMVs produced by a wide variety of Gram-negative bacteria are spherical nanostructures (20–250 nm) and contain not only components of the outer membrane such as LPS, outer membrane proteins, and phospholipids but also periplasmic proteins and peptidoglycan given that OMVs can entrap parts of the underlying bacterial periplasm (8Ellis T.N. Kuehn M.J. Virulence and immunomodulatory roles of bacterial outer membrane vesicles.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar).Thus, OMVs are heterogeneous complexes of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as LPS, peptidoglycan, flagellin, and CpG DNA as well as other outer membrane proteins, virulence factors, or immunomodulatory compounds that are important for pathogenesis (9Kulp A. Kuehn M.J. Biological functions and biogenesis of secreted bacterial outer membrane vesicles.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 64: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that OMVs play a role as protective transport vesicles, delivering toxins, enzymes, and DNA to eukaryotic cells (8Ellis T.N. Kuehn M.J. Virulence and immunomodulatory roles of bacterial outer membrane vesicles.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2010; 74: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Furthermore, different studies have provided evidence that OMVs have a potential role to trigger the innate inflammatory response. OMVs of Helicobacter pylori and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to elicit IL-8 production by epithelial cells (10Ismail S. Hampton M.B. Keenan J.I.

The pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) in the host recognize a vast array of PAMPs, and the recognition of Gram-negative bacteria by PRRs is mediated primarily by Toll-like receptor (TLRs) (12Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Toll-like receptors.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4745) Google Scholar). It has been reported that V. cholerae induces inflammatory response recognition through TLR5 (6Bandyopadhaya A. Sarkar M. Chaudhuri K. IL-1β expression in Int407 is induced by flagellin of Vibrio cholerae through TLR5 mediated pathway.Microb. Pathog. 2008; 44: 524-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and TLR4 signaling pathways (13Matson J.S. Yoo H.J. Hakansson K. Dirita V.J.

In addition to TLRs that recognize bacterial ligands at the plasma membrane and luminal side of intracellular vesicles, a family of proteins called nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), sense bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) in the cytosol. Upon recognition of its bacterial ligand, NOD induces activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB signaling pathways that are involved in cellular responses against bacteria by releasing cytokines and chemokines that recruit and activate immune inflammatory cells (14Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nod-like proteins in immunity, inflammation and disease.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). It was recently revealed that OMVs from H. pylori, P. aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea harbor PG with NOD1 agonist activity (15Kaparakis M. Turnbull L. Carneiro L. Firth S. Coleman H.A. Parkington H.C. Le Bourhis L. Karrar A. Viala J. Mak J. Hutton M.L. Davies J.K. Crack P.J. Hertzog P.J. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Whitchurch C.B. Ferrero R.L. Bacterial membrane vesicles deliver peptidoglycan to NOD1 in epithelial cells.Cell. Microbiol. 2010; 12: 372-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that this intracellular NOD receptor might play an important role in recognition of O395 OMV to induce an inflammatory response. The intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) are located throughout intestinal lamina propria as immature cells, and DCs are recruited to the microbial site of infection by chemokines and induce an inflammatory response (16Coombes J.L. Powrie F. Dendritic cells in intestinal immune regulation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells (ECs) were found to actively influence DC functions in bacterial handling across epithelial monolayers (17Rimoldi M. Chieppa M. Larghi P. Vulcano M. Allavena P. Rescigno M.

Intestinal immune homeostasis is regulated by the crosstalk between epithelial cells and dendritic cells.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Upon activation by inflammatory mediators across EC monolayers, DCs undergo maturation, which is associated with high surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules as well as different secreted immunomodulatory cytokines that drives the naïve T cells into Th1 or Th2 cells. In addition to Th1 or Th2 cells, DCs have also been implicated in the promotion of Th17 cells. Th17 cells are a distinct population of CD4+ T cells that secrete IL-17 and have been associated with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (19Chabaud M. Durand J.M. Buchs N. Fossiez F. Page G. Frappart L. Miossec P. Human interleukin-17: a T cell-derived proinflammatory cytokine produced by the rheumatoid synovium.Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) and multiple sclerosis (20Kurasawa K. Hirose K. Sano H. Endo H. Shinkai H. Nawata Y. Takabayashi K. Iwamoto I. Increased interleukin-17 production in patients with systemic sclerosis.Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-17 proinflammatory function leading to IL-8 stimulation raises the possibility that IL-17 may play a role during bacterial infections (21Luzza F. Parrello T. Monteleone G. Sebkova L. Romano M. Zarrilli R. Imeneo M. Pallone F. Up-regulation of IL-17 is associated with bioactive IL-8 expression in Helicobacter pylori-infected human gastric mucosa.J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5332-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). IL-23, a heterodimeric cytokine that consists of a p19 subunit specific for IL-23 and the p40 subunit of IL-12 (22Bettelli E. Kuchroo V.K. IL-12- and IL-23-induced T helper cell subsets: birds of the same feather flock together.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), has been shown to play a significant role in the maintenance of Th17 cells (23McKenzie B.S. Kastelein R.A. Cua D.J. Understanding the IL-23-IL-17 immune pathway.Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that V. cholerae stimulated EC-DC cross-talk and induced CD4+ T cells to differentiate into inflammatory Th2 cells (24Bhowmick S. Chatterjee D. Chaudhuri K. Human epithelial cells stimulated with Vibrio cholerae produce thymic stromal lymphopoietin and promote dendritic cell-mediated inflammatory Th2 response.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2012; 44: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Several reports have been published about the inflammatory response of V. cholerae O395 strains, but it is not known how O395 OMVs interact with the host. Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate whether OMVs can modulate DC function through the epithelial barrier, which is important for the activation of T cells. We previously reported that cholera toxin is associated with V. cholerae OMVs, which are internalized into intestinal epithelial cells (7Chatterjee D. Chaudhuri K. Association of cholera toxin with Vibrio cholerae outer membrane vesicles which are internalized by human intestinal epithelial cells.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that OMVs induce an inflammatory response in intestinal epithelial cells in a NOD1-dependent manner and produce different cytokines and chemokines that recruit dendritic cells, leading subsequently to a predominant Th2 and Th17 response. The streptomycin-resistant V. cholerae O395 (O1 classical, Ogawa, cholera toxin-positive) strain used in the present study was maintained at −70 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and grown in LB medium with 1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C. Int407, HEK293, and HT29 cells (National Center for Cell Sciences, Pune, India) were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) containing penicillin/streptomycin and gentamycin in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were seeded and maintained in T-25 tissue culture flasks (Falcon, BD Biosciences). Medium was removed from confluent cell layers, cells were washed with PBS, fresh medium without antibiotic was added, and cells were incubated with V. cholerae O395 OMV (50 μg/ml) or with 50 μg/ml iE-DAP (γ-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid; InvivoGen) as a cognate elicitor of NOD1 for the stipulated time periods. Cells designated as non-infected controls were also replenished with fresh medium. The vesicles were isolated from late exponential phase (8 h) V. cholerae cultures using the procedure described earlier (7Chatterjee D. Chaudhuri K. Association of cholera toxin with Vibrio cholerae outer membrane vesicles which are internalized by human intestinal epithelial cells.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from a 1-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation (4500 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45-μm-pore size membrane (Millipore) to remove residual cells. An aliquot of the filtrate was tested for the presence of viable V. cholerae cells on LB agar. In all cases, no colonies were detected. Protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) was then added to the filtrate to prevent protein degradation, and the filtrate was kept at 4 °C. Vesicles were recovered by ultracentrifugation (140,000 × g, 4 h, 4 °C) using a Sorvall T-865 rotor, washed with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and suspended in PBS. The protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). OMVs were stored at −80 °C and used within a week. Int407, HEK293, and HT29 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured as described above until confluence. Cells were then incubated with various concentrations of OMV and incubated in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 48 h. Medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS followed by addition of fresh medium without antibiotic. For the MTT (Sigma) assay, MTT reagent was added to each well of a 96-well plate containing treated or untreated cells and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h. The reaction was stopped with the addition of the solubilization reagent DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). The absorbance of the samples was then measured with an ELISA plate reader (EMax molecular filter plate) at 550 nm. Total RNA was harvested from cells using an Rneasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). For cDNA preparation, 5 μg of RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen) in a 10-μl volume according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the reverse transcription reaction, 2 μl of DNase-treated RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScriptTM First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) with 0.50 μg of oligo(dT)12–18 in a total volume of 20 μl. The cDNA synthesis was done at 42 °C for 50 min following the manufacturer's instructions. In semiquantitative RT-PCRs, about 2 μl of cDNA was PCR-amplified in a 30-μl reaction volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5–2.5 mm MgCl2, a 0.26 mm concentration of each dNTP, and 25 pmol of each primer as described earlier (5Bandyopadhaya A. Sarkar M. Chaudhuri K. Human intestinal epithelial cell cytokine mRNA responses mediated by NF-κB are modulated by the motility and adhesion process of Vibrio cholerae.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The annealing temperature and product size of all the genes are listed in Table 1. For each cytokine and chemokine gene, the primers were designed using Primer3 software. To determine the cytokine and chemokine gene expression, reactions were heat-denatured for 5 min at 95 °C and then amplified with 35 PCR cycles, each comprising successive incubations at 95 °C for 30 s and annealing at 52–72 °C (given for each respective gene in Table 1) for 1 min and at 72 °C for 30 s. A further extension step was done at 72 °C for 7 min. PCRs were normalized by analysis of expression of the gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Amplicons were identified by ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels.TABLE 1Primer sequences used in RT-PCR for the genes mentioned belowGene (protein)PrimersProduct sizeAnnealing temperaturebp°CIL8 (IL-8)F 5′-ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTGGCT-328960R 5′-TCTCAGCCCTCTTCAAAAACTTCTC-3′CSF2 (GM-CSF)F 5′-ACACTGCTGAGATGAATGAAACAGTAG-3′28655R 5′-TGGACTGGCTCCCAGCAGTCAAAGGGGATG-3′CCL2 (CCL2)F 5′-CCCCAGTCACCTGCTGTTAT-3′17355R 5′-TGGAATCCTGAACCCACTTC-3′CCL20 (CCL20)F 5′-GCAAGCAACTTTGACTGCT-3′15054R 5′-ATTTGCGCACACAGACAACT-3′TSLP (TSLP)F 5′-CCCAGGCTATTCGGAAACTCAG-3′11652R 5′-CGCCACAATCCTTGTAATTGTG-3′CCL3 (CCL3)F 5′-TGCAACCAGTTCTCTGCATC-3′19855R 5′-TTTCTGGACCCACTCCTCAC-3′CCL4 (CCL4)F 5′-AAGCTCTGCGTGACTGTCC-3′21156R 5′-GCTTGCTTCTTTTGGTTTGG-3′CCL19 (CCL19)F 5′-ATCCCTGGGTACATCGTGAG-3′17256R 5′-GCTTCATCTTGGCTGAGGTC-3′IL6 (IL-6)F 5′-CCTTCCAAAGATGGCTGAAA-3′23060R 5′-CAGGGGTGGTTATTGCATCT-3′IL1B (IL-1β)F 5′-AAACAGATGAAGTGCTCCTTCCAGG-3′38860R 5′-TGGAGAACACCACTTGTTGCTCCA-3′TNFA (TNF-α)F 5′-CGGGACGTGGAGCTGGCCGAGGAG-3′35572R 5′-CACCAGCTGGTTATCTCTCAGCTC-3′CCL17 (CCL17)F 5′-CTTCTCTGCAGCACATCCAC-3′16357R 5′-CTGCCCTGCACAGTTACAAA-3′CCL22 (CCL22)F 5′-ACTGCACTCCTGGTTGTCCT-3′21752R 5′-CGGCACAGATCTCCTTATCC-3′IL12B (IL-12p40)F 5′-ATGTCGTAGAATTGGATTGGTATCCG-3′35865R 5′-GTACTGATTGTCGTCAGCCACCAGC-3′IL23A (IL-12p19)F 5′-TTCCCCATATCCAGTGTGGAG-3′15155R 5′-TCAGGGAGCAGAGAAGGCTC-3′IL12A (IL-12p35)F 5′-TTCACCACTCCCAAAACCTGC-3′22558R 5′-GAGGCCAGGCAACTCCCATTA G-3′IL17A (IL-17)F 5′-ACCAATCCCAAAAGGTCCTC-3′28058R 5′-GGGGACAGAGTTCATGTGGT-3′NOD1 (NOD1)F 5′-TCCAAAGCCAAACAGAAACTC-3′18060R 5′-CAGCATCCAGATGAACGTG-3′NOD2 (NOD2)F 5′-GAAGTACATCCGCACCGAG-3′17460R 5′-GACACCATCCATCCATGAGAAGACAG-3′GAPDH (GAPDH)F 5′-ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGG-3′45055R 5′-GGATGCTAAGCAGTTGGT-3′ Open table in a new tab Gene silencing of NOD1 by siRNA was performed by transfection of siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 24 h prior to siRNA transfection. At 72 h after siRNA treatment, cells were stimulated as indicated. For transient transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded at a density of 70% without fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The following day, cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA containing NF-κB-driven (nuclear factor) luciferase reporter gene (Stratagene) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated for 3 h with O395 OMV. The results are expressed as NF-κB-luciferase units. The cells were then lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and luminescence was measured as relative luciferase units in a luminometer (Junior LB9505, Berthold, Germany). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque. Cells were washed twice with sterile PBS and transferred to 24-well tissue culture plates coated with human IgG at a concentration of 3–5 × 105cells/ml. Following 2 h of incubation, non-adherent cells were flushed away by extensive washing with PBS. To obtain immature DCs, adherent monocytes were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 50 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; BD Pharmingen) and 20 ng/ml IL-4 (BD Pharmingen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 days. Morphology and surface phenotype of monocyte-derived DCs were monitored by microscopy and flow cytometry. Epithelial cell monolayers of HT29 cells (50 μl; 3–4 × 105 cells) were seeded in the Transwell filter inserts (3-μm-diameter pores; Millipore), which were placed in 24-well plates containing 1 ml of medium. Monolayers were maintained for 5–7 days (changing medium every other day) until a transepithelial resistance reading of 300 ohms/cm2 (measured using a Millicell ERS volt meter; Millipore) was achieved. Filters were turned upside down, and DCs (4 × 105) were seeded on the filter facing the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells for 4 h to let the cells attach to the filter. Filters were then turned upside down again into 24-well plates. At this point, the cells were kept in antibiotic-free medium. The Transwell insert filters were either left unstimulated or stimulated directly with OMV. Following 12 h of incubation, medium was changed to one containing antibiotics. DCs and culture supernatants were collected after 24 h from the bottom chamber. DCs were detached from filters by gentle centrifugation and analyzed by cytofluorometry for surface activation markers. Cytokines were measured in culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Medium from EC monolayers was removed, and cells were washed with PBS and kept in fresh medium without antibiotic. Some wells were stimulated with O395 OMV from the apical surface (top chamber), and the rest were left unstimulated as controls. After 12 h, OMVs were washed out, and the medium was changed to one containing antibiotics in all the wells including controls. Culture supernatants were collected after 12 h from the lower chamber (facing the basolateral membrane) and used to activate DCs. DCs were incubated for 24 h in the culture supernatant and analyzed phenotypically for expression of surface activation markers. Analysis of cytokines released by DCs was performed by measuring culture supernatants before and after DC incubation. OMV-incubated or unincubated epithelial cells were lysed by lysis buffer (100 μl; 1.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 1% bromphenol blue). Before loading, samples were boiled (100 °C,10 min)with β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), and then samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE with prestained protein molecular weight markers (10 μl; Genei, India), semidry electrotransferred (Bio-Rad) onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% BSA. The primary antibodies used were rabbit phospho-p44/42 (ERK1/2) MAPK monoclonal antibody, p44/p42 MAPK antibody, phospho-p38 antibody, p38 antibody, phospho-SAPK/JNK, and IκBα (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) and mouse β-actin (1:5000 dilution; Sigma) in TBS-Tween 20 buffer containing 5% BSA. Then the membrane was washed with TBS-Tween 20 followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Genei) or rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Genei) at 1:2000 dilutions. The alkaline phosphatase-positive bands were visualized in a developing solution (1× 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Genei), 1.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), and water) in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. DCs were harvested and washed three times in cold FACS buffer (PBS, 3% FCS, and 0.02% NaN3) and then stained with appropriate antibodies (anti-CD80, -HLA-DR, and -CD83) for 30 min on ice in the dark. After proper washing, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry with appropriate isotype control antibodies (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). DCs conditioned with O395 OMV-stimulated or unstimulated EC supernatant were collected after 24 h and washed twice to remove any cytokine. Allogenic CD4+CD45RA+ naïve T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MACS isolation system, Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). DCs were then co-cultured with 5 × 104 freshly purified T cells in round bottomed 96-well culture plates in a ratio of 1:5 (DC/T cell) in the presence or absence of neutralizing antibody IL-23p19 (10 μg/ml; eBioscience). After 5 days of culture, cells and supernatants were collected for RNA extraction and cytokine analyses, respectively. IL-8, GM-CSF, CCL2, CCL20, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-13, IL-4, TNF-α, and IL-17 concentrations were determined by commercially available ELISA kits (R&D Systems). The data from RT-PCR, ELISA, and Western blot were recorded as means ± S.D. from at least three different experiments. Comparison between two groups was analyzed by Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. The semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blots were quantified by using the image analysis software ImageJ. The integrated density of each band was normalized to the corresponding GAPDH band in the case of RT-PCR. In the case of Western blot, the integrated density of each band was normalized to the corresponding β-actin or control antibody (unphosphorylated). Recent work in our laboratory has shown that cholera toxin is associated with V. cholerae O395 OMVs, which are internalized into intestinal epithelial cells (7Chatterjee D. Chaudhuri K.

The p110δ catalytic isoform of PI3K is highly expressed in lymphocytes and plays a prominent role in B and T cell responses. Another class IA PI3K catalytic isoform, p110α, is a promising drug target in cancer but little is known about its function in lymphocytes. Here we used highly selective inhibitors to probe the function of p110α in lymphocyte responses in vitro and in vivo. p110α inhibition partially reduced B cell receptor (BCR)-dependent AKT activation and proliferation, and diminished survival supported by the cytokines BAFF and IL-4. Selective p110δ inhibition suppressed B cell responses much more strongly, yet maximal suppression was achieved by targeting multiple PI3K isoforms.

PI3Ks are a family of eight lipid kinase enzymes that produce 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in cellular membranes (1.Vanhaesebroeck B. Guillermet-Guibert J. Graupera M. Bilanges B. The emerging mechanisms of isoform-specific PI3K signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Four of these (p110α, p110β, p110γ, and p110δ) are categorized as class I PI3Ks based on their ability to use phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as a substrate to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP 2The abbreviations used are: PIP3 phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate PE phycoerythrin APC Allophycocyanin CFSE succinimidyl ester 5-(and -6) carboxyfluorescein diacetate MZ marginal zone pAKT phosphorylated AKT TCR T cell receptor MTS 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium PHA phytohemagglutinin BCR B cell receptor GC germinal center.). The production of PIP3 leads to recruitment of selected proteins to the membrane and coordinates the assembly of signaling complexes that drive cellular responses to receptor engagement. A hallmark of cancer cells is an elevation in PIP3, and targeting class I PI3K is a priority in cancer drug discovery (2.Agarwal R. Carey M. Hennessy B. Mills G.B.

Each of the class I PI3K catalytic isoforms has been implicated in tumorigenesis and/or maintenance. Of these, p110α has received the most attention because gain-of-function mutations in the PIK3CA gene encoding this enzyme are very common in human cancer (6.Samuels Y. Wang Z. Bardelli A.

A distinct PI3K isoform p110β has been suggested to control basal PIP3 production and drive cancer cells when PTEN, the major PIP3 phosphatase, is inactivated (11.Edgar K.A. Wallin J.J. Berry M. Lee L.B. Prior W.W. Sampath D. Friedman L.S. Belvin M.

A third class IA catalytic isoform, p110δ, has an emerging role in cancers derived from B lymphoid cells (3.Fruman D.A. Rommel C. PI3Kδ inhibitors in cancer. Rationale and serendipity merge in the clinic.Cancer Discov. 2011; 1: 562-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The other class I PI3K catalytic isoform, p110γ, is categorized as class IB because it associates with distinct regulatory subunits (p101 or p84). It is now appreciated that tumor growth and survival can be either restrained or promoted by cells of the immune system (4.Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A.

Consequently, it is important to understand how novel anti-cancer drugs impact immune cells. The ideal targeted therapy would enhance anti-tumor immunity while preserving patient immunity to infection. Two class I PI3K isoforms that are highly expressed in leukocytes, p110γ and p110δ, are known to have pleiotropic functions in a variety of immune cells (1.Vanhaesebroeck B. Guillermet-Guibert J.

Fruman D.A. PI3Ks in lymphocyte signaling and development.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2010; 346: 57-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For years there have been useful reagents to study p110γ and p110δ, including selective small molecule inhibitors and mouse strains with null mutations, conditional alleles, and kinase-inactive knock-in alleles. By contrast, little is known about p110α function in the immune system even though this isoform is expressed ubiquitously. Mice with null or kinase-inactive alleles of Pik3ca die during embryonic development (17.Bi L. Okabe I. Bernard D.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Nussbaum R.L.

Angiogenesis selectively requires the p110α isoform of PI3K to control endothelial cell migration.Nature. 2008; 453: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). B cell-specific deletion of Pik3ca did not reveal a unique function of p110α, but suggested a redundant function with p110δ in peripheral B cell survival (20.Ramadani F. Bolland D.J. Garcon F. Emery J.L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Corcoran A.E. Okkenhaug K. The PI3K isoforms p110α and p110δ are essential for pre-B cell receptor signaling and B cell development.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra60Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). p110α deletion in B cells was accompanied by increased p110β expression, potentially compensating for p110α loss (20.Ramadani F. Bolland D.J. Garcon F. Emery J.L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Corcoran A.E. Okkenhaug K. The PI3K isoforms p110α and p110δ are essential for pre-B cell receptor signaling and B cell development.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra60Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Identifying the acute effects of p110α inhibition has been hindered by the absence of highly selective small molecule inhibitors. In this study, we made use of rationally designed compounds with high selectivity for p110α relative to other PI3Ks and to other cellular kinases. We compared two investigational agents, A66 and MLN1117, along with a set of inhibitors targeting p110β, p110α/p110β, p110δ, or all class I isoforms. The results provide the first evidence that p110α has a measurable quantitative input to AKT phosphorylation and B cell proliferation following BCR cross-linking. However, selective p110α inhibition has a minimal effect overall on B cell and CD4 T cell function, especially when compared with p110δ inhibition. These findings support the hypothesis that p110α inhibitors in clinical trials will not strongly suppress adaptive immune function. For phospho-flow staining, rabbit antibodies specific for phosphorylated proteins were from Cell Signaling Technologies: Akt (# 4060) and rS6 (# 5364). For flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, anti-mouse antibodies were: CD4-PE, B220-PE, IgD-eFluor405, IgM-FITC, CD21-FITC, CD23-PE, CD24-PE, CD11d-APC, MOMA-FITC, GL7-Alexa Fluor 647, hCD3-APC, hCD19-PE, DyLight604-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody, and streptavidin-conjugated PE or APC (SA-PE/SA-APC). All flow cytometry antibody reagents were purchased from eBioscience and Biolegend. Succinimidyl ester 5-(and -6) carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFSE), 7-aminoactinomycin D, Fluo-3, and Fura Red were obtained from Invitrogen. Intracellular phosphorylation of Akt (S473) and S6 (S240/44) was performed as previously described (21.Janes M.R. Limon J.J. So L. Chen J. Lim R.J. Chavez M.A. Vu C. Lilly M.B. Mallya S. Ong S.T. Konopleva M. Martin M.B. Ren P. Liu Y. Rommel C. Fruman D.A. Effective and selective targeting of leukemia cells using a TORC1/2 kinase inhibitor.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Briefly, single-cell suspensions of murine splenocytes from 8–12-week-old Balb/c mice were first treated with ACK lysis buffer to remove RBCs. A total of 106 cells were treated with different inhibitors for 15 min prior to stimulation using 10 μg/ml of anti-IgM F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 15 min in a 37 °C water bath. Cells were immediately fixed with 16% paraformaldehyde stock solutions for a final 1.6% concentration for 10 min at RT. Cells were subsequently washed, then permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 20 min on ice. Before staining, cells were washed twice in FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide). Unconjugated primary antibodies were added (pAkt (S473) 1:50, pS6 (S240/44) 1:200) for 1 h at RT. Samples were washed once with FACS buffer and an antibody mixture containing DyLight604-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:300) and B220-PE antibody (1:200) was added for 30 min on ice. Specifically for pAkt (S473) analysis, the signal was amplified by using a biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:300; Southern Biotech) for 30 min at RT before adding B220-PE and SA-APC. After staining, cells were washed once with FACS buffer and analyzed on a FACS Calibur equipped with 488- and 635-nm laser lines. SK-OV-3 and U87MG cell lines were obtained from ATCC. A total of 5000 cells/well in low serum media (0.2% FBS) were seeded in triplicate wells of a 96-well flat bottom culture plate for 18 h to adhere. Media was aspirated and inhibitors in 0.2% FBS media were added to each well at the indicated concentrations. After 48 h, cell viability was determined using the MTS assay (Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One solution cell proliferation assay kit; Promega) with absorbance (490 nm) measured in a microplate spectrophotometer. B cells were purified by negative selection using the B cell isolation kit (Miltenyi). For CFSE proliferation assays, purified B cells were labeled with 5 μm CFSE in PBS containing 2% FBS for 5 min at RT. CFSE-labeled B cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of the indicated inhibitors at a density of 106 cells/ml either in 24- or 48-well plates in lymphocyte media (LCM; RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 mm HEPES buffer, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). For activation, 10 μg/ml of anti-mouse IgM F(ab′)2 (Jackson) with/without IL-4 (10 ng/ml) (R&D Systems) or 10 μg/ml of LPS (Sigma) was used. For survival assays, purified B cells were cultured with either IL-4 (20 ng/ml) or BAFF (60 ng/ml) (Peprotech) for 2 days in culture. Cells were harvested and stained for 7-aminoactinomycin D to analyze cell death by flow cytometry. For human B cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll separation from whole blood obtained from the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science at the University of California, Irvine. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were labeled with CFSE as described above and were activated with anti-IgD dextran (400 ng/ml) and human IL-4 (20 ng/ml) (R&D Systems). After 3 days, cells were harvested and stained with human CD19-PE antibody to gate on B cells. RBC lysed total splenocytes from DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice were labeled with CFSE at a final concentration of 5 μm as described above. After 15 min pre-treatment with the indicated inhibitors, cells were subsequently activated using 10 nm OVA peptide 323–339 (Anaspec) for 3 days in lymphocyte media. After 24 h, 100 μl of supernatants from each sample were collected for cytokine ELISAs. After 3 days, cells were harvested and stained with a CD4-PE antibody to gate on TCR transgenic CD4 T cells. For human T cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood obtained from the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, University of California, Irvine. Monocytes and lymphocytes were then purified using a countercurrent elutriation method. On average, 80–90% of the cells were human CD3+ based on flow cytometry. Cells were labeled with CFSE as described above and activated with 1 μg/ml of PHA (Sigma) for 3 days in lymphocyte media. After 3 days, cells were harvested and stained with human CD3-APC antibody to gate on total T cells. Supernatants from 24-h activated DO11.10 CD4 T cells were used to detect both mouse IL-2 and IFNγ levels using the Ready-Set-Go ELISA kit (eBioscience). Supernatants from 24-h PHA activated human T cells were used to detect human IL-2 using the Ready-Set-Go ELISA kit (eBioscience) and human IFNg (gamma) using an ELISA kit from BioLegend. Splenocytes were stained with CD1d-biotin, SA-APC, and CD24-PE antibodies prior to loading with the calcium indicator dyes Fluo-3 and Fura Red as described previously (22.Donahue A.C. Fruman D.A. Distinct signaling mechanisms activate the target of rapamycin in response to different B-cell stimuli.Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 2923-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with the indicated inhibitors for 15 min at 37 ºC. The baseline level of Fluo-3/Fura Red was collected for 1 min on a FACS Calibur before cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml of anti-IgM for 7 min. Cells were then stimulated with 50 ng/ml of ionomycin and acquired for an additional 1 min as a positive control. Wild-type 8-week-old Balb/cJ mice (Jackson Labs) were used for all experiments. MLN1117 and GDC-0941 were given by oral gavage using a sterile disposable 20-guage 1.5′ feeding needle (Fisher). IC87114 was delivered via intraperitoneal injection. For the non-immunization experiment, 2 mice per group (Vehicle, GDC-0941, and MLN1117) were given the indicated drugs for 9 days before sacrificing on day 10. For the immunization experiment, 4 mice per group were used to perform two independent studies comparing GDC-0941 or IC87114 to MLN1117 as described in the text. In all cases, the vehicle group received both vehicles used to formulate the two different drugs. Mice were treated with the drugs throughout day −1 to day 13. On day 0, all mice were immunized with NP-OVA precipitated in alum (Imject; Pierce). Drug treatment was stopped on day 13 and mice were sacrificed for collection of serum and spleens. Spleens were immediately made into single-cell suspensions for flow cytometric analysis and the rest were quickly frozen in an OCT compound (VWR) for sectioning. For TI-2 immunization, mice were immunized with TNP-Ficoll and serum was collected on day 7. 96-Well NUNC MaxiSorp plates (Nalgene) were coated with 50 μl of either NP(30)BSA or NP(3)BSA (Biosearch Technologies) at 50 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. Serum Ig was detected with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibodies against IgM and IgG1 (Invitrogen). Plates were developed with TMB peroxidase (eBioscience) for colorimetric detection after which the reaction was stopped with 1 n sulfuric acid and read on a plate reader at 450 nm. For TNP-Ficoll immunization, plates were coated with 100 μl of TNP-BSA at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 1½ h at room temperature. Serum Ig was detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies against IgG3 (Southern Biotech). Plates were developed as described above. Mouse spleens embedded in OCT medium were frozen and 8-μm sections were cut and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific). Slides were fixed in acetone at −20 ºC for 20 min and blocked with FACS buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Immunohistochemical staining was done with anti-mouse antibodies against IgD-eFluor405, IgM-FITC, and GL7-Alexa Fluor647 (all 1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three 5-min washes in PBS. Marginal zone (MZ) B cells were identified as IgM-bright, IgD-dim cells surrounding IgM-dim, IgD-bright follicles. Germinal center B cells were identified as IgD-negative, GL7-positive. For some sections, antibodies against B220-PE and metallophilic macrophage (MOMA-1)-FITC were used as an alternative method to identify MZ B cells (B220-positive cells outside the MOMA-1 border). All images shown were acquired at either ×10 or 20 magnification using Olympus Fluoview FV1000 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. The inhibitors used in this study are listed in Table 1 along with their isoform selectivity defined by in vitro kinase activity assays using recombinant enzymes. We used two p110α-selective inhibitors with distinct chemical structure, to minimize possible off-target effects. A66 has been studied previously in preclinical cancer models (9.Jamieson S.

To inhibit p110β we used TGX-221 (25.Chaussade C. Rewcastle G.W. Kendall J.D. Denny W.A. Cho K. Grønning L.M. Chong M.L. Anagnostou S.H. Jackson S.P. Daniele N. Shepherd P.R.

As another means to inhibit p110β, we used the compound MLN1316, a dual p110α/p110β inhibitor that is highly selective relative to p110δ and p110γ (Table 1).

https://openalex.org/W2066515215,"Objective Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly prescribed for epilepsy and bipolar disorder but little is known about their use in pregnancy. We examined secular trends in AED prescribing in pregnancy and pregnancy as a determinant for stopping AED prescribing. Methods We identified 174,055 pregnancies from The Health Improvement Network UK primary care database. Secular trends in AED prescribing during pregnancy were examined between 1994 and 2009. We used Cox's regression analyses to compare time to discontinuation of AED prescriptions between pregnant and non-pregnant women and to identify predictors of discontinuation of AEDs in pregnancy. Results Prescribing of carbamazepine and sodium valproate have declined since 1994 despite being the most commonly prescribed AEDs in pregnancy up to 2004. Prescribing of lamotrigine in pregnancy has steadily increased and has been the most popular AED prescribed in pregnancy since 2004. Pregnant women with epilepsy were twice as likely to stop receiving AEDs (Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.00, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.62–2.47) when compared to non-pregnant women and for women with bipolar disorder this was even higher (HR 3.07, 95% CI 2.04–4.62). For pregnant women with epilepsy, those receiving AEDs less regularly before pregnancy were more likely to stop receiving AEDs in pregnancy. Conclusions Lamotrigine has been increasingly prescribed in pregnancy over older AEDs namely carbamazepine and sodium valproate. Pregnancy is a strong determinant for the discontinuation of AED prescribing particularly for women with bipolar disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2001867962,"The Escherichia coli l-cysteine desulfurase IscS mobilizes sulfur from l-cysteine for the synthesis of several biomolecules such as iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters, molybdopterin, thiamin, lipoic acid, biotin, and the thiolation of tRNAs. The sulfur transfer from IscS to various biomolecules is mediated by different interaction partners (e.g. TusA for thiomodification of tRNAs, IscU for FeS cluster biogenesis, and ThiI for thiamine biosynthesis/tRNA thiolation), which bind at different sites of IscS. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies of a ΔtusA strain showed that the expression of genes of the moaABCDE operon coding for proteins involved in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis is increased under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Additionally, under anaerobic conditions the expression of genes encoding hydrogenase 3 and several molybdoenzymes such as nitrate reductase were also increased. On the contrary, the activity of all molydoenzymes analyzed was significantly reduced in the ΔtusA mutant. Characterization of the ΔtusA strain under aerobic conditions showed an overall low molybdopterin content and an accumulation of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate. Under anaerobic conditions the activity of nitrate reductase was reduced by only 50%, showing that TusA is not essential for molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. We present a model in which we propose that the direction of sulfur transfer for each sulfur-containing biomolecule is regulated by the availability of the interaction partner of IscS. We propose that in the absence of TusA, more IscS is available for FeS cluster biosynthesis and that the overproduction of FeS clusters leads to a modified expression of several genes.

We present a model in which we propose that the direction of sulfur transfer for each sulfur-containing biomolecule is regulated by the availability of the interaction partner of IscS. We propose that in the absence of TusA, more IscS is available for FeS cluster biosynthesis and that the overproduction of FeS clusters leads to a modified expression of several genes."
https://openalex.org/W2080214451,"The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein functions as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. In this capacity, APC forms a ""destruction complex"" with Axin, CK1α, and GSK3β to foster phosphorylation of the Wnt effector β-catenin earmarking it for Lys-48-linked polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. APC is conjugated with Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains when it is bound to Axin, but it is unclear whether this modification promotes the APC-Axin interaction or confers upon APC an alternative function in the destruction complex. Here we identify HectD1 as a candidate E3 ubiquitin ligase that modifies APC with Lys-63 polyubiquitin. Knockdown of HectD1 diminished APC ubiquitylation, disrupted the APC-Axin interaction, and augmented Wnt3a-induced β-catenin stabilization and signaling. These results indicate that HectD1 promotes the APC-Axin interaction to negatively regulate Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2147970665,"Natriuretic peptides (NPs) are cardioprotective through the activation of guanylyl cyclase (GC) receptors A and B. CD-NP, also known as cenderitide, is a novel engineered NP that was designed to uniquely serve as a first-in-class dual GC receptor agonist. Recognizing the aldosterone suppressing actions of GC-A activation and the potent inhibitory actions on collagen synthesis and fibroblast proliferation through GC-B activation, the current study was designed to establish the anti-fibrotic actions of CD-NP, administered subcutaneously, in an experimental rat model of early cardiac fibrosis induced by unilateral nephrectomy (UNX). Our results demonstrate that a two week subcutaneous infusion of CD-NP significantly suppresses left ventricular fibrosis and circulating aldosterone, while preserving both systolic and diastolic function, in UNX rats compared to vehicle treated UNX rats. Additionally we also confirmed, in vitro, that CD-NP significantly generates the second messenger, cGMP, through both the GC-A and GC-B receptors. Taken together, this novel dual GC receptor activator may represent an innovative anti-fibrotic therapeutic agent."

The additional hydroxylation of EF-P at the same lysine residue by the YfcM protein has also recently been described. The roles of modified and unmodified EF-P during different steps in translation, and how this correlates to its physiological role in the cell, have recently been linked to the synthesis of polyproline stretches in proteins. Polysome analysis indicated that EF-P functions in translation elongation, rather than initiation as proposed previously. This was further supported by the inability of EF-P to enhance the rate of formation of fMet-Lys or fMet-Phe, indicating that the role of EF-P is not to specifically stimulate formation of the first peptide bond. Investigation of hydroxyl-(β)-lysyl-EF-P showed 30% increased puromycin reactivity but no differences in dipeptide synthesis rates when compared with the β-lysylated form. Unlike disruption of the other genes required for EF-P modification, deletion of yfcM had no phenotypic consequences in Salmonella. Taken together, our findings indicate that EF-P functions in translation elongation, a role critically dependent on post-translational β-lysylation but not hydroxylation.Background: Post-translational modification activates bacterial elongation factor P (EF-P) in several Gram-negative bacteria.Results: The addition of β-lysine alone is sufficient for activation of EF-P to function in translation.Conclusion: Modified EF-P acts by regulating translation of a subset of mRNAs.Significance: EF-P can post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by controlling translation elongation.

Severe infections with Gram-negative bacteria are normally treated with aminoglycosides of various chemical modifications (1Chen L.F. Kaye D.

These antibacterial chemicals are affordable and are low resistance drugs with a high potency (2Forge A. Schacht J. Aminoglycoside antibiotics.Audiol. Neurootol. 2000; 5: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). One of these, gentamicin, is widely used in treatments of enterococcal, mycobacterial, and severe Gram-negative bacterial infections and acts on the bacterial ribosome, interrupting bacterial protein synthesis (3Blanchard S.C.

Application of gentamicin in high doses has, however, resulted in accumulation in the cochlea of the inner ear and the renal proximal tubular cells, and has been associated with both ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (2Forge A.

The human megalin receptor (also known as gp330 and LRP2) is a scavenger receptor, belonging to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family (8Raychowdhury R. Niles J.L. McCluskey R.T. Smith J.A. Autoimmune target in Heymann nephritis is a glycoprotein with homology to the LDL receptor.Science. 1989; 244: 1163-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is expressed widely throughout the body, including the cochlea of the inner ear (9Mizuta K. Saito A. Watanabe T. Nagura M. Arakawa M. Shimizu F. Hoshino T. Ultrastructural localization of megalin in the rat cochlear duct.Hear. Res. 1999; 129: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the kidneys (10Kerjaschki D. Farquhar M.G. The pathogenic antigen of Heymann nephritis is a membrane glycoprotein of the renal proximal tubule brush border.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 5557-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In the kidney nephrons, megalin is localized on the apical surface of polarized epithelial cell membranes facing the proximal tubule (11Chatelet F. Brianti E. Ronco P. Roland J. Verroust P. Ultrastructural localization by monoclonal antibodies of brush border antigens expressed by glomeruli. I. Renal distribution.Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 500-511PubMed Google Scholar). Its function in the inner ear is, however, unknown. Megalin is reported to bind at least 30 different ligands, including vitamin- and hormone-binding proteins, lipoproteins, and several other carrier proteins, including albumin and hemoglobin (12Christensen E.I. Birn H. Megalin and cubilin: multifunctional endocytic receptors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Megalin undergoes endocytosis initiated by interactions via the adaptor protein disabled-2 (Dab2), through the third intracellular NPXY motif (13Gallagher H. Oleinikov A.V. Fenske C. Newman D.J. The adaptor disabled-2 binds to the third ψ xNPxY sequence on the cytoplasmic tail of megalin.Biochimie. 2004; 86: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Structural work on the megalin receptor is very limited. From sequence analyses, the huge extracellular part consisting of 4400 residues has different domains, the most abundant being the complement type repeat (CR) 2The abbreviations used are: CRcomplement type repeatRAPreceptor-associated proteinERendoplasmic reticulumLRPLDL receptor-related proteinHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlationTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyAIRambiguous interaction restraintr.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. domains. Each of these consists of ∼40 residues and contains a calcium binding site and three disulfide bonds (14Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo A.K. Farquhar M.G.

U.S.A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). A total of four CR clusters appear in the extracellular part of megalin, containing 7, 8, 10, and 11 CR domains (14Saito A.

The linker region between each CR domain varies in length and residue composition, suggested to be of importance for the ligand adaptation (15Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

To date, only a single structure of a megalin CR domain has been solved: the 12th CR domain from rat megalin (CR12r) (16Wolf C.A. Dancea F. Shi M. Bade-Noskova V. Rüterjans H. Kerjaschki D. Lücke C.

Because of the sparse structural information available, little is known regarding the broad ligand binding profile of this family of receptors. Most CR domains bind to receptor-associated protein (RAP) during synthesis in the ER (21Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J.

The positively charged ligands bind around the calcium binding site, which imposes a large negative surface potential on the CR domains driving the interaction. It has been firmly established that gentamicin accumulates in the epithelial cells of the proximal renal tubule or the cochlea of the inner ear via megalin (26Tauris J. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A.

Once inside the cell, it accumulates in the lysosomes and the ER, where it binds to calreticulin, leading to elevated levels of misfolded protein in the cell (28Hariprasad G. Kumar M. Rani K. Kaur P.

After further accumulation, gentamicin is released into the cytosol, leading to oxidative stress and apoptosis (30Lopez-Novoa J.M. Quiros Y. Vicente L. Morales A.I. Lopez-Hernandez F.J. New insights into the mechanism of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity: an integrative point of view.Kidney Int. 2011; 79: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), as well as to a reduction in the SGLT-1-dependent glucose transport (31Takamoto K. Kawada M. Usui T. Ishizuka M. Ikeda D. Aminoglycoside antibiotics reduce glucose reabsorption in kidney through down-regulation of SGLT1.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In vivo experiments using megalin knock-out mice have shown that megalin deficiency offers protection from gentamicin accumulation, indicating that megalin is the major contributor to gentamicin cell accumulation (32Schmitz C. Hilpert J. Jacobsen C. Boensch C. Christensen E.I. Luft F.C. Willnow T.E. Megalin deficiency offers protection from renal aminoglycoside accumulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 618-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, megalin deficiency in mice also led to progressive hearing loss and affected the uptake of the steroid hormone β-estrogen (33König O. Rüttiger L. Müller M. Zimmermann U.

A number of different approaches have been taken to lower the toxic effect of gentamicin. Some have targeted intracellular effects, e.g. by adding antioxidants such as allium or mitoquinone (34Nabavi S.F. Nabavi S.M. Moghaddam A.H. Naqinezhad A. Bigdellou R. Mohammadzadeh S.

Kawada M. Ikeda D. Yoshida M. Apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) safeguards pig proximal tubular LLC-PK1 cells against reduction in SGLT1 activity induced by gentamicin C.Biochim. Biophys.

Inhibition of gentamicin binding to rat renal brush-border membrane by megalin ligands and basic peptides.J. Control Release. 2006; 112: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These peptides have, however, not proven potent, and consequently, more efficient and structure-based design of receptor antagonists could prove resourceful. To aid this design, we have solved the solution structure of the 10th CR domain from the human megalin receptor alone and modeled its complex with gentamicin based on NMR chemical shift analyses. Gentamicin binds in the ligand binding site with submillimolar affinity utilizing the common binding motif. We discuss how this rather weak binding affinity may be linked to kidney failure and hearing loss during antibacterial treatment. Stable isotope-labeled CR10 from human megalin (CR10h) was expressed in P. pastoris (Invitrogen) with the cDNA encoding for megalin (1103–1148) (GenBankTM U33837) optimized for P. pastoris expression, inserted into pPICZαC (GeneArt) using the following primers (restriction sites underlined): 5′-CGCCTCGAGAAGAGA-3′ and 5′-TAGTCTAGATTAATGATGATGATGATGATG-3′ (TAG Copenhagen). The correct sequence of the CR10h-pPICZαC was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon). CR10h-pPICZαC was linearized using SacI and inserted using electroporation into strain X-33 pretreated with lithium acetate and DTT (39Wu S. Letchworth G.J. High efficiency transformation by electroporation of Pichia pastoris pretreated with lithium acetate and dithiothreitol.BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 152-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate multicopy recombinant colonies, a total of 12 colonies were picked from YPDS plates containing 2000 μg/ml ZeocinTM, and their vector was confirmed by colony PCR. The expression levels were tested by small-scale expression before isolating the highest expressing colony. A total of 250 ml of buffered (pH 6.0) minimal growth medium containing 1% (w/v) [13C6]glucose and 0.5% (w/v) [15N](NH4)2SO4 were used to grow P. pastoris to an A600 ∼4 while shaking at 200 rpm, 30 °C. The cells were harvested and dissolved to an A600 ∼1 in 1 liter of buffered induction medium containing 0.5% (w/v) [15N] (NH4)2SO4 and 0.5% (v/v) [13C]methanol. The culture was grown for 3 days, and 0.5% (v/v) [13C]methanol was added once every 24 h. The cell medium was isolated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min at 5 °C. The medium was adjusted to pH 8.0, loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare), and eluted in 100 mm imidazole, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. To obtain correctly folded protein, megalin CR10h was subjected to refolding by two protocols. In the first, protein (∼0.1 mg/ml) was reduced in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, and dialyzed toward 2 × 5 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 1/0.1 mm reduced/oxidized glutathione, pH 8.2, using a molecular weight cut-off filter of 3500 Da at 4 °C, followed by 5 liters of the same buffer without the redox pair present.

Briefly, CR10h (∼0.2 mg/ml) was reduced in 6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0, and after 1 h, was further diluted to ∼0.1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 8 mm 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide, pH 8.5 (refolding buffer) and refolded by dialysis toward 5 liters of refolding buffer at room temperature with N2 gas bubbling through the first 24 h followed by 24 h at 4 °C without. This was followed by exhaustive dialysis at 4 °C toward 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8, to remove urea and the redox pair. The refolded protein was captured using a HisTrap FF column as described above. The eluted protein was deglycosylated overnight at room temperature using 0.5 units/μl N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) under native conditions. Refolded, concentrated CR10h was acidified to pH ∼3 by 10% (v/v) TFA and loaded onto a μRPC C2/C18 column (GE Healthcare), eluted in a linear gradient from 0 to 70% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) TFA, identified by RAP binding, buffer-exchanged, and concentrated for NMR spectroscopy. Purity and identity were verified by SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequencing (Alphalyse).

An 800-MHz Varian INOVA spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance cryoprobe with a Z-field gradient, a 750-MHz Varian INOVA spectrometer equipped with a room temperature probe with a Z-field gradient, or an 800-MHz Bruker Avance equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance TCI cryoprobe were used. RAP binding was tested by adding 1:1 molar ratio of unlabeled RAP domain 1–2 purified as described (18Jensen G.A. Andersen O.M. Bonvin A.M. Bjerrum-Bohr I. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. O'Shea C.

The following experiments were recorded at 25 °C using Varian/Agilent BioPack sequences to assign backbone and side chain resonances: 1H,15N HSQC, 1H,13C CT-HSQC, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, C(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, TOCSY 15N HSQC, and HCCH TOCSY spectra. NOE distance information was obtained from assigning and scoring peaks in aliphatic and aromatic NOESY 13C HSQC (mixing times 150 ms) and NOESY 15N HSQC (mixing times 150 ms) spectra. The HCCH TOCSY and the two NOESY 13C HSQC spectra were recorded on the sample buffer exchanged to 100% (v/v) D2O. All recorded free induction decays were processed using nmrPipe (41Delaglio F.

Proton chemical shifts were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid at 0.00 ppm and heteronuclei indirectly using their gyromagnetic ratios. Assignments of the CR10h backbone nuclei were performed by manually picking and linking resonances using CcpNMR analysis (42Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M.

Through eight iterations, a total of 200 structures were calculated in each cycle, selecting the 20 lowest energy models for the next iteration. Initially, structure calculations were performed based exclusively on the NOEs. Subsequently, three disulfide bonds, additional hydrogen bonds, and six calcium coordinating restraints were added. The calcium-oxygen distances were set to 2.3 ± 0.2 Å, based on the mean and S.D. of 389 high resolution (<2.0 Å) crystal structures in the MESPEUS database (45Hsin K. Sheng Y. Harding M.M. Taylor P.

Finally, the 20 lowest energy structures were refined in explicit water and selected to represent the final solution structure. To define the electrostatics and size of the calcium ion during the water refinement, the force field values for the Ca2+ radius were adjusted to 2.440 Å, and the Lennard-Jones potential well depth (ϵ) was set to 0.41 (46Aaqvist J. Ion-water interaction potentials derived from free energy perturbation simulations.J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 8021-8024Crossref Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Two samples were sequentially mixed to record chemical shift perturbations in the presence of increasing gentamicin concentration. The gentamicin sulfate obtained from Sigma contains a mixture of three different types: C1 (25–50%), C1a (10–35%), and C2 (25–55%). The first sample contained 100 μm [15N,13C]CR10h dissolved in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10% (v/v) D2O, 0.1 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid, 0.1% (v/v) NaN3, pH 6.5. The second sample was similar and contained in addition 10 mm gentamicin. 1H,15N HSQC experiments were recorded on each sample, before transferring the gentamicin sample to the one without in five steps. A total of seven HSQC spectra with varying gentamicin concentrations were acquired. Changes in backbone chemical shifts were used to map the overall binding site; the sizes of the chemical shift changes were calculated using Equation 1 Δδobs=γH(δHfreeN−δHobsN)2+γN(δNfree−δNobs)2(Eq. 1) where δHfreeN and δHobsN are the unbound and observed proton chemical shift, and δfreeN and δobsN are the unbound and observed nitrogen chemical shift weighted by their respective (numerical) gyromagnetic ratios, γH and γN. The binding constant, Kd, was determined using Equation 2, Δδobs =δfree +δbound [Kd+[L]T+[P]T−(Kd+[L]T+[P]T)2−(4[P]T[L]T)](12[P]T)(Eq. 2) where Δδobs is the sum of unbound (δfree) and fully bound (δbound) times a factor of total protein concentration ([P]T) and total ligand concentration ([L]T), as well as the dissociation constant Kd.

The ability of pathogenic fungi to develop a multifaceted response to the wide variety of stressors found in the host environment is important for virulence and pathogenesis. Extracellular proteins represent key mediators of the host-parasite interaction. To analyze the expression profile of the proteins secreted by Paracoccidioides, Pb01 mycelia and yeast cells, we used a proteomics approach combining two-dimensional electrophoresis with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-Q-TOF MS/MS). From three biological replicates, 356 and 388 spots were detected, in mycelium and yeast cell secretomes, respectively. In this study, 160 non-redundant proteins/isoforms were indentified, including 30 and 24 proteins preferentially secreted in mycelia and yeast cells, respectively. In silico analyses revealed that 65% of the identified proteins/isoforms were secreted primarily via non-conventional pathways. We also investigated the influence of protein export inhibition in the phagocytosis of Paracoccidioides by macrophages. The addition of Brefeldin A to the culture medium significantly decreased the production of secreted proteins by both Paracoccidioides and internalized yeast cells by macrophages. In contrast, the addition of concentrated culture supernatant to the co-cultivation significantly increased the number of internalized yeast cells by macrophages. Importantly, the proteins detected in the fungal secretome were also identified within macrophages. These results indicate that Paracoccidioides extracellular proteins are important for the fungal interaction with the host."

We present comprehensive characterization of tumor aggregates generated using the 3D Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS). Methods CNS cancer cell lines were grown in conventional 2D cultures and the RCCS and comparison with a cohort of 53 pediatric high grade gliomas conducted by genome wide gene expression and microRNA arrays, coupled with immunohistochemistry, ex vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy and drug sensitivity evaluation using the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Vorinostat. Results Macroscopic RCCS aggregates recapitulated the heterogeneous morphology of brain tumors with a distinct proliferating rim, necrotic core and oxygen tension gradient. Gene expression and microRNA analyses revealed significant differences with 3D expression intermediate to 2D cultures and primary brain tumors. Metabolic profiling revealed differential profiles, with an increase in tumor specific metabolites in 3D. To evaluate the potential of the RCCS as a drug testing tool, we determined the efficacy of Vorinostat against aggregates of U87 and KNS42 glioblastoma cells. Both lines demonstrated markedly reduced sensitivity when assaying in 3D culture conditions compared to classical 2D drug screen approaches. Conclusions Our comprehensive characterization demonstrates that 3D RCCS culture of high grade brain tumor cells has profound effects on the genetic, epigenetic and metabolic profiles of cultured cells, with these cells residing as an intermediate phenotype between that of 2D cultures and primary tumors. There is a discrepancy between 2D culture and tumor molecular profiles, and RCCS partially re-capitulates tissue specific features, allowing drug testing in a more relevant ex vivo system."
https://openalex.org/W2065983137,"Our recent studies have shown that bone marrow-derived fibroblast precursors contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the recruitment and activation of bone marrow-derived fibroblast precursors are incompletely understood. We found that interleukin 6 was induced in the kidney in a murine model of renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction. Therefore, we investigated if interleukin 6 play a role in the recruitment and maturation of bone marrow-derived fibroblast precursors in the kidney during the development of renal fibrosis. Wild-type and interleukin 6 knockout mice were subjected to unilateral obstructive injury for up to two weeks. Interleukin 6 knockout mice accumulated similar number of bone marrow-derived fibroblast precursors and myofibroblasts in the kidney in response to obstructive injury compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, IL-6 knockout mice expressed comparable α-SMA in the obstructed kidney compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, targeted disruption of Interleukin 6 did not affect gene expression of profibrotic chemokine and cytokines in the obstructed kidney. Finally, there were no significant differences in renal interstitial fibrosis or expression of extracellular matrix proteins between wild-type and interleukin 6 knockout mice following obstructive injury. Our results indicate that interleukin 6 does not play a significant role in the recruitment of bone marrow-derived fibroblast precursors and the development of renal fibrosis."

As such, this mechanism contributes to neuronal aging and neurodegeneration. Aging is associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideDCFdichlorofluoresceinPP24-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(dimethylethyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrmidine. in the cell, a condition known as oxidative stress (1Valko M. Leibfritz D. Moncol J. Cronin M.T. Mazur M. Telser J. Free radicals and antioxidants in normal physiological functions and human disease.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 44-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (9970) Google Scholar). ROS, which are synthesized during the metabolism of oxygen, play important roles in cell signaling. However, during aging or under conditions of cellular stress, such as in certain neurodegenerative diseases, they can diffuse in the cytoplasm and begin to oxidize a variety of essential components, including lipids, ribonucleic acids, and proteins (2Stadtman E.R. Protein oxidation and aging.Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). This may result in significant cellular damage (3Harman D. The biologic clock. The mitochondria?.J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1972; 20: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Potassium (K+) channels are targets of ROS in these conditions (4Sesti F. Liu S. Cai S.Q. Oxidation of potassium channels by ROS. A general mechanism of aging and neurodegeneration?.Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 45-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The first experimental evidence for oxidation of K+ channels by ROS during aging came from the worm Caenorhabditis elegans (5Cai S.Q. Sesti F. Oxidation of a potassium channel causes progressive sensory function loss during aging.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this animal, oxidative modification of the voltage-gated K+ channel KVS-1 leads to progressive loss of neurosensory function (taste). KVS-1 is a homolog to mammalian KCNB1, which is abundantly expressed in the brain. Like KVS-1, KCNB1 is also a redox-susceptible channel (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Oxidized KCNB1 channels are ∼10-fold more abundant in the brains of old, rather than young, mice. ROS effects on KCNB1 and KVS-1 are mediated by two conserved N-terminal cysteine residues, Cys-73 and Cys-113, respectively. The functional modifications resulting from their oxidation are different, though. KVS-1 is a rapidly activating-inactivating K+ channel (A-type). Oxidation of Cys-113 turns the channel in a non-inactivating channel. In contrast, KCNB1 can be described as a delayed rectifier (non-inactivating) channel, and its oxidation produces two major modifications. First, it induces the oligomerization of the channel through the formation of intersubunit disulfide bridges involving Cys-73 and a cysteine in the C terminus, Cys-710. Second, it decreases the open probability, giving rise to non-conducting channels. KCNB1 oxidation promotes apoptosis in cultured cells, an effect primarily caused by oligomer formation and not by changes in the magnitude of the current. Evidence further shows that oxidation of KCNB1 is associated with increased ROS. Thus, considering the central role played by KCNB1 in the cortex and hippocampus and the fact that this channel is oxidized in the aging mouse brain and in the brain of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J.

Here we show that oxidative conditions lead to the accumulation of KCNB1 channels in the plasma membrane by impairing their internalization. KCNB1 aggregates disrupt glycolipid raft organization, triggering a stress signal that results in the activation of an apoptotic cascade mediated by c-Src and JNK kinases. Undifferentiated mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% sodium pyruvate. Cells were transfected at 90% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Chemicals were prepared in stocks and freshly added prior the experiment. The chemicals used were as follows: cholesterol (Sigma), 3 mg/ml in DMEM, serum-free; methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (Sigma), 20 mm in DMEM, serum-free; 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes), 500 μm in 4.7% DMSO, 95.2% PBS; IETD-CHO (caspase-8 inhibitor I) (EMD Chemicals), 2.5 mm in DMSO; SP600125 (Sigma), 10 mm in DMSO; dTDP (Sigma), 100 mm in DMSO; l-glutathione, reduced (Sigma), 150 mm in PBS; and PP2 (Cayman Chemicals), 10 mm in DMSO. In both surface expression and internalization (biotin feeding (7Xu X. Kanda V.A. Choi E. Panaghie G. Roepke T.K. Gaeta S.A. Christini D.J. Lerner D.J. Abbott G.W.

Res. 2009; 82: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)) assays we used the biotin derivative sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, which can be removed upon application of impermeable glutathione (therefore only internalized, biotin-labeled proteins are protected from biotin cleavage). Thus, 24 h after transfection, N2A cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h and washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 100 mm glycine. The cells were oxidized with 25 μm dTDP in DMEM, serum-free, at 37 °C for 5 min and then incubated for 5, 25, or 55 min in normal DMEM. Then, for surface expression measurements, cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS and harvested. For internalization measurements, cells were washed three times with PBS and immediately subjected to three cycles of biotin cleavage by 10-min incubation in ice-cold PBS containing 75 mm reduced glutathione. Cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). We then freshly added 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitors mixture set I (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was mixed with (SA)-linked streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min and washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer. Samples were incubated in SDS/PAGE sample buffer containing 10% (w/v) 2-mercaptoethanol at 90–100 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant containing the eluted KCNB1-HA protein was immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche). 24 h after transfection, cells seeded on coverslips were biotinylated as described above. Then cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 25 μm dTDP in DMEM without serum at 37 °C for 7 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min, and washed twice with PBS. Then cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min, washed twice with PBS, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking, cells were incubated with streptavidin-FITC (Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 45 min and washed three times with PBS. Cells were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Apoptosis measurements were performed as described before (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells positive to annexin V were computed manually (using the Annexin V/PI kit, Roche) in 25 μm2 areas (typically, four to six measurements). Experiments were performed blindly. Thus, N2A cells were plated on 12-mm glass coverslips. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, incubated for 15–30 min with inhibitors, and exposed to 25 μm dTDP or 1.0 mm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 5 min and then washed twice with PBS. The cells were incubated for 6 h in fresh DMEM. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with annexin V labeling buffer solution (20 μl of annexin V-Fluos and 20 μl of propidium iodide in 1 ml of incubation buffer). Propidium iodide detects necrotic cells provided by the kit for 15 min according to the instructions of the manufacturer and mounted on an Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with Nomarski optics and a digital camera. Measurements were performed as described before (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, N2A cells were incubated with 5 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, DCFH-DA, for 30 min. 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate permeates the cell membrane and becomes hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases to nonfluorescent dichlorofluorescein, DCFH. In the presence of ROS, DCFH is oxidized to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein, DCF. Cells were washed twice with PBS and analyzed with an Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with Nomarski optics and a digital camera. Digitally acquired pictures were subsequently analyzed with ImageJ 1.44 software (National Institutes of Health). Quantitative data are presented as mean ± S.E. The level of significance was calculated using Student's t test for single comparisons and analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. Normality was assessed by the F-test, and corrections were performed using a Tukey means comparison test with a 95% confidence level using OriginPro 7.5 software. Statistical significance was assumed at the 95% confidence limit or greater (p < 0.05). Oxidants promote the formation of KCNB1 oligomers (held together by disulfide bridges between an N-terminal cysteine, Cys-73, and a C-terminal cysteine, Cys-710) that exacerbate apoptosis in mammalian cells (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J.

In a first approach, we evaluated surface expression of KCNB1 oligomers by fluorescence. Fig. 1A shows representative confocal images of undifferentiated mouse neuroblastoma (N2A) cells labeled with FITC-conjugated biotin. Protein labeling qualitatively increased in oxidized cells expressing KCNB1. This suggested that oxidative conditions may lead to the accumulation of KCNB1 channels in the plasma membrane by impairing their endocytosis. To test this possibility, we determined the fraction of internalized KCNB1 channels by biotin feeding (7Xu X. Kanda V.A. Choi E. Panaghie G. Roepke T.K. Gaeta S.A. Christini D.J. Lerner D.J. Abbott G.W. Mink-dependent internalization of the IKs potassium channel.Cardiovasc. Res. 2009; 82: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). KCNB1 channels epitope-tagged to the HA tag in the C terminus (KCNB1-HA) were labeled with glutathione-cleavable sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, oxidized, treated in the absence/presence of glutathione (75 mm), streptavidin-immunoprecipitated, and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. Representative results of experiments carried out with wild-type and C73A KCNB1, respectively, are shown in Fig. 1B. The bands in the two left lanes of the immunoblots in the figure (− glutathione, Surface) correspond to the amounts of channels in the membrane of cells incubated in the absence/presence of 25 μm dTDP. Densitometry analysis of five experiments such as the one shown in Fig. 1B indicated that wild-type channel surface expression increased in cells subjected to an oxidative challenge by +18 ± 1% (p < 0.013), whereas C73A expression did not change significantly (+4 ± 0.1%). These results were consistent with confocal data (Fig. 1A) and with a previous report (9Pal S.K. Takimoto K. Aizenman E. Levitan E.S. Apoptotic surface delivery of K+ channels.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The bands in the two right lanes of the immunoblots (+ glutathione, Internalized) correspond to the fractions of internalized channels in control and oxidative conditions. Accordingly, wild-type internalization was impaired in response to an oxidative insult. In contrast, C73A-mutant channels did not show accumulation in the membrane nor did they exhibit internalization defects. The time course of KCNB1 internalization, expressed as the fraction of internalized channels in the presence of dTDP normalized to the control, 10, 30, and 60 min post-oxidation is shown in Fig. 1C. Wild-type internalization was impaired markedly within the first 10 min after the oxidative insult, but within 1 h it had recovered by more than 70%. In contrast, C73A channels did not exhibit internalization defects. We showed previously that in cells expressing the wild type, ROS levels increased post-oxidation (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This increase was likely the culprit of the incomplete recovery of wild-type channels 1 h post-oxidation. As a means of control, endocytosis was inhibited by maintaining the temperature at 4 °C (n = 4 experiments). As the representative experiment in Fig. 1D illustrates, under these conditions internalization of KCNB1 channels was inhibited irrespective of the redox status of the cell. Together, these results indicate that oxidative conditions leads to the accumulation of wild-type KCNB1 channels in the plasma membrane by impairing their endocytosis. KCNB1 localizes in glycolipid rafts (10Martens J.R. Navarro-Polanco R. Coppock E.A. Nishiyama A. Parshley L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. Differential targeting of Shaker-like potassium channels to lipid rafts.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7443-7446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), whose most common form of endocytosis proceeds through clathrin-coated pits. This mechanism of internalization requires the GTPase dynamin 2 (11Robinson M.S. The role of clathrin, adaptors and dynamin in endocytosis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Dynamin-independent internalization is also thought to occur but only in caveolar lipid rafts (12Nabi I.R. Le P.U. Caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). To distinguish these possibilities, we employed a dominant-negative dynamin 2 mutant bearing a Lys-to-Ala replacement at position 44 (K44A) (13van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. Mutations in human dynamin block an intermediate stage in coated vesicle formation.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). As expected, the K44A mutant markedly inhibited the internalization of KCNB1 channels (Fig. 2A). Densitometry analysis of three experiments revealed a decrease of ∼75% in the fraction of internalized channels in cells cotransfected with K44A compared with cells cotransfected with wild-type dynamin 2 (Fig. 2B). Thus, KCNB1 endocytosis requires dynamin 2, consistent with the notion that the channel localizes in planar, non-caveolar lipid rafts. Lipid raft microdomains contain stress receptors which can initiate cellular apoptosis in conjunction with elevated ROS (reviewed in Ref. 14Morgan M.J. Kim Y.S. Liu Z. Lipid rafts and oxidative stress-induced cell death.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This argues that KCNB1 aggregates may cause raft disturbance and, consequently, activate an apoptotic cascade. To test this idea, we determined whether reinforcement of raft integrity reduced apoptosis under oxidative conditions. We preincubated cells with 30 μg/ml cholesterol, typically for 2 h, before the application of 25 μm dTDP. Six hours post-oxidation, cells were scored for apoptosis by annexin V staining. In agreement with previous reports (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Pal S. Hartnett K.A. Nerbonne J.M. Levitan E.S. Aizenman E. Mediation of neuronal apoptosis by Kv2.1-encoded potassium channels.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4798-4802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dTDP treatment increased apoptotic death by more than 2-fold in cells expressing wild-type KCNB1 (Fig. 3A). Cells preincubated with cholesterol exhibited markedly lower apoptotic rates. Coupling cholesterol with 1 mm MβCD-cholesterol complex, which favors adsorption of free cholesterol, further lessened apoptosis. Moreover, cholesterol supplementation had negligible effect on the levels of apoptosis, which remained fairly low, in cells transfected with C73A (Fig. 3B). This result was expected because the mutant does not enhance apoptosis in cells challenged with oxidants. Cholesterol depletion by incubation with 3.0 mm MβCD for 2 h promoted apoptosis as expected (Fig. 3C). However, apoptotic levels were comparable in cells transfected with either the wild type or C73A (Fig. 3, C and D). This result corroborated the notion that oxidation of KCNB1 promotes lipid raft disruption because if the two mechanisms were distinct, apoptotic rates should have been lower in cells transfected with C73A. Furthermore, the number of cells undergoing necrosis, which did not depend on dTDP treatment, was low and fairly stable in all conditions tested (≤ 5 ± 1%). The anti-apoptotic effect of cholesterol could stem from the reinforcement of the structure of the raft or, alternatively, rescue of defective KCNB1 internalization. To distinguish these possibilities, we carried out biotin feeding experiments in the presence of cholesterol (Fig. 4). In three experiments, pretreatment with cholesterol did not prevent nor rescue defective internalization of oxidized KCNB1 channels (Fig. 4B). We conclude that cholesterol suppresses apoptosis by acting to restore raft organization.FIGURE 4Cholesterol does not affect KCNB1 endocytosis. A, Western blot analysis visualization of a representative biotin feeding experiment in N2A cells expressing wild-type KCNB1 channels. Cells were preincubated (2 h) and maintained in 30 μg/ml cholesterol until oxidation with 25 μm dTDP.

We focused on raft-associating Src tyrosine kinases because they have been shown to interact with the channel (15Sobko A. Peretz A. Attali B. Constitutive activation of delayed-rectifier potassium channels by a Src family tyrosine kinase in Schwann cells.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4723-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, in a first set of experiments, we inhibited Src activity with selective inhibitor PP2. Cells were incubated for 30 min with the compound, oxidized with dTDP, and scored for apoptosis. PP2 treatment completely suppressed apoptosis caused by oxidation of wild-type KCNB1 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the compound did not alter apoptotic rates in cells expressing C73A, which remained fairly low (Fig. 5B). Moreover, inhibition of caspase 8, which is activated in response to Fas signaling, another well characterized apoptotic pathway triggered by raft disruption, did not ameliorate apoptosis (Fig. 5C). This result suggests that KCNB1 oligomers specifically act to recruit/activate Src tyrosine kinase. This enzyme can be constitutively active (v-Src) as opposed to normal c-Src (16Anderson S.K. Gibbs C.P. Tanaka A. Kung H.J. Fujita D.J. Human cellular Src gene. Nucleotide sequence and derived amino acid sequence of the region coding for the carboxy-terminal two-thirds of pp60c-Src.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1122-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, to ascertain whether KCNB1 activated v-Src, c-Src, or both, we employed a c-Src dominant-negative mutant in which a lysine residue at position 295 is replaced with an arginine (K295R) (17Suprynowicz F.A. Baege A. Sunitha I. Schlegel R. c-Src activation by the E5 oncoprotein enables transformation independently of PDGF receptor activation.Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Coexpression of the wild type or K295R c-Src with wild-type KCNB1 did not significantly increase apoptotic levels in the absence of oxidative insults (Fig. 5D). In contrast, when cells were exposed to dTDP, apoptosis was augmented in cells expressing the wild-type c-Src, whereas cells transfected with K295R exhibited levels of apoptosis comparable with the control. Moreover, inhibition of c-Src by either PP2 or K295R expression did not affect necrotic death, which remained fairly low and constant in all conditions (≤ 6 ± 2%). c-Src kinases promote the downstream activation of the stress-activated JNKs, which initiate apoptotic signaling through multiple mechanisms, including oxidative stress (18Dhanasekaran D.N. Reddy E.P. JNK signaling in apoptosis.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6245-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Therefore, we probed the role of JNK in the mechanism of KCNB1 oxidation-mediated toxicity by inhibiting the activity of the kinase by selective inhibitor SP600125. Fig. 6A illustrates the levels of apoptosis in cells expressing wild-type KCNB1 in control cells or cells preincubated with SP600125 prior the oxidative insult. At all concentrations tested (0.5–5 μm), the compound suppressed the pro-apoptotic effect of the channel in a slight concentration-dependent fashion. High levels of ROS under steady-state conditions were observed previously in cells expressing wild-type KCNB1 exposed to an oxidative insult (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Destabilization of active mitochondria, with consequent ROS release and apoptosis, is a distinctive feature of death signaling pathways such as the Src/JNK pathway. Therefore, we determined whether oxidative stress was dependent on c-Src activity. Toward this end, we quantified ROS levels by DCF (the oxidized product of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein) fluorimetry as done before (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In these experiments, we replaced dTDP with H2O2, which is rapidly metabolized by the cell (19Dringen R. Metabolism and functions of glutathione in brain.Progress Neurobiol. 2000; 62: 649-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar) and therefore only marginally contributed to DCF fluorescence, which was measured 3 h post-oxidation. Accordingly, in both mock or C73A-transfected cells, exposure to H2O2 produced low levels of DCF fluorescence (Fig. 6B). In contrast, DCF signals markedly increased in cells expressing the wild-type channel (Fig. 6C), but inhibition of c-Src activity, by preincubation with PP2, reduced DCF signals in a dose-dependent fashion. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of KCNB1 oxidation. Our results show that KCNB1 oligomers, which are formed as a result of oxidation of Cys-73 (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), were poorly endocytosed. This led to accumulation of oxidized KCNB1 channels in the plasma membrane. In contrast, C73A mutant channels, which do not form oligomers, did not exhibit internalization defects and, therefore, did not build up in the membrane. KCNB1 channels localize in planar lipid rafts, microdomains enriched in cholesterol, and sphingolipids (20George K.S. Wu S. Lipid raft. A floating island of death or survival.Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2012; 259: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Rafts are thought to contain signaling molecules capable of activating pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic cascades. Changes that result in glycolipid raft disruption, such as accumulation of KCNB1 oligomers, may activate these death receptors and initiate apoptosis. Accordingly, we found that supplementing cholesterol to the cells markedly reduced apoptotic death. The mechanism through which cholesterol protects cells against KCNB1 oxidation-induced apoptosis is not completely understood, but biochemical evidence showed that cholesterol supplementation did not rescue defective internalization of KCNB1 oligomers. More likely, cholesterol acted to restore and/or maintain lipid raft organization and, consequently, prevent the activation of death receptors. Furthermore, pharmacological, molecular, and fluorimetric evidence indicated that the formation of KCNB1 aggregates was associated with activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase along with oxidative stress. ROS and c-Src act in concert to activate JNK (reviewed in Ref. 14Morgan M.J. Kim Y.S. Liu Z. Lipid rafts and oxidative stress-induced cell death.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears likely that c-Src activation, along with elevated ROS levels, promoted sustained activation of JNK which, in turn, initiated apoptosis. In conclusion, these data lead us to formulate a model that predicts that the formation of KCNB1 aggregates in the membrane disrupts lipid raft integrity, causing apoptosis via the activation of the c-Src/JNK pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of c-Src activity partially decreased oxidative stress associated with KCNB1 oxidation (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that multiple pathways act to increase ROS levels in the cell. c-Src has been shown to interact with NADPH oxidase and to stimulate the production and release of ROS (21Catarzi S. Biagioni C. Giannoni E. Favilli F. Marcucci T. Iantomasi T. Vincenzini M.T. Redox regulation of platelet-derived-growth-factor-receptor. Role of NADPH-oxidase and c-Src tyrosine kinase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, oxidative stress is a natural consequence of apoptotic cascades such as the one triggered by c-Src activation. The molecular nature of c-Src-independent pathways is not known, but we can reasonably assume that they are initiated in the membrane because C73A did not induce oxidative stress (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This leads us to speculate that KCNB1 oligomers may act to activate the ROS-generating machinery present in lipid raft, such as NADPH-oxidase. Future studies will elucidate these mechanisms. Src tyrosine kinases have been shown to modulate KCNB1 through phosphorylation of Tyr-124, Tyr-686, and Tyr-810 (22Song M.Y. Hong C. Bae S.H. So I. Park K.S. Dynamic modulation of the kv2.1 channel by SRC-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation.J. Proteome Res. 2012; 11: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Tiran Z. Peretz A. Attali B. Elson A. Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Kv2.1 channel activity at tyrosine 124 by Src and by protein-tyrosine phosphatase ϵ.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17509-17514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the physiological relevance of Tyr-686 and Tyr-810 phosphorylation by Src is not known, Tyr-124 plays an important role in mouse Schwann cells, where its phosphorylation constitutes an important step during proliferation and myelination (15Sobko A. Peretz A. Attali B. Constitutive activation of delayed-rectifier potassium channels by a Src family tyrosine kinase in Schwann cells.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4723-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that oxidative conditions induce phosphorylation of Tyr-124 in concert with phosphorylation of Ser-800 by p38 MAPK. This activity leads to insertion of de novo synthesized KCNB1 channels in the membrane, causing apoptosis through a robust K+ current surge (9Pal S.K. Takimoto K. Aizenman E. Levitan E.S. Apoptotic surface delivery of K+ channels.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Redman P.T. He K. Hartnett K.A. Jefferson B.S. Hu L. Rosenberg P.A. Levitan E.S. Aizenman E. Apoptotic surge of potassium currents is mediated by p38 phosphorylation of Kv2.1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3568-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the C73A variant, which is likely to be a substrate for the c-Src kinase, did not cause apoptosis under oxidative conditions nor accumulated in the membrane. In addition, oxidized KCNB1 channels do not conduct current (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Overall, this evidence argues that phosphorylation of KCNB1 by c-Src and p38 it is neither sufficient nor necessary for apoptosis, even though it is likely to occur under oxidative conditions. Furthermore, the requirement of newly exocytosed KCNB1 channels to explain their plasma accumulation seems unnecessary in light of our findings, which show their impaired internalization. The two mechanisms do not exclude each other, though, and future studies will elucidate this specific issue. Oxidation of K+ channels by ROS is a general mechanism of toxicity in the aging nervous system. In the invertebrate C. elegans, oxidative modification of voltage-gated K+ channel KVS-1 leads to progressive neurodegeneration (5Cai S.Q. Sesti F. Oxidation of a potassium channel causes progressive sensory function loss during aging.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In mice, oxidized KCNB1 channels were found to be ∼10-fold more abundant in old rather than young animals and were hyperoxidized (∼200-fold) in the brain of the 3xTg-AD model of Alzheimer's disease (6Cotella D. Hernandez-Enriquez B. Wu X. Li R. Pan Z. Leveille J. Link C.D. Oddo S. Sesti F. Toxic role of K+ channel oxidation in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 4133-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a condition characterized by extensive oxidative damage. Hence, considering the impact of neuronal aging on global human health issues, these findings may contribute to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of nervous system aging.

Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the star forming region IC 348 in the constellation Perseus have revealed a young protostar, termed L54361, producing periodic outbursts in the mid-infrared. L54361's infrared luminosity increases tenfold in roughly one week every 25.34 days. The authors attribute this variability to pulsed accretion associated with an unseen binary companion. The unexpected strength and regularity of this accretion signal may be related to the age of the system, which at 100,000 years is one-tenth the age of previously studied pulsed accretors. Periodic increases in luminosity arising from variable accretion rates have been predicted for some pre-main-sequence close binary stars as they grow from circumbinary disks1,2,3. The phenomenon is known as pulsed accretion and can affect the orbital evolution and mass distribution of young binaries2,4, as well as the potential for planet formation5,6. Accretion variability is a common feature of young stars, with a large range of amplitudes and timescales as measured from multi-epoch observations at optical7,8 and infrared9,10,11,12,13 wavelengths. Periodic variations consistent with pulsed accretion have been seen in only a few young binaries via optical accretion tracers14,15,16, albeit intermittently with accretion luminosity variations ranging from zero to 50 per cent from orbit to orbit. Here we report that the infrared luminosity of a young protostar (of age about 105 years) increases by a factor of ten in roughly one week every 25.34 days. We attribute this to pulsed accretion associated with an unseen binary companion. The strength and regularity of this accretion signal is surprising; it may be related to the very young age of the system, which is a factor of ten younger than the other pulsed accretors previously studied."
https://openalex.org/W2024179705,"Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) play a major role in determining whether cells undergo apoptosis in response to TNF as well as other stimuli. However, TNF is also highly proinflammatory through its ability to trigger the secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which is arguably the most important role of TNF in vivo. Indeed, deregulated production of TNF-induced cytokines is a major driver of inflammation in several autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we show that IAPs are required for the production of multiple TNF-induced proinflammatory mediators. Ablation or antagonism of IAPs potently suppressed TNF- or RIPK1-induced proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. Surprisingly, IAP antagonism also led to spontaneous production of chemokines, particularly RANTES, in vitro and in vivo. Thus, IAPs play a major role in influencing the production of multiple inflammatory mediators, arguing that these proteins are important regulators of inflammation in addition to apoptosis. Furthermore, small molecule IAP antagonists can modulate spontaneous as well as TNF-induced inflammatory responses, which may have implications for use of these agents in therapeutic settings."

The direct RT-LAMP assay was evaluated and compared to both RT-LAMP and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in detecting EV71 infection with 145 nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The clinical performance demonstrated the sensitivity and specificity of direct RT-LAMP was reported to be 90.3% and 100% respectively, compared to RT-LAMP, and 86.83% and 100% respectively, compared to qRT-PCR.

https://openalex.org/W2076968048,"Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are ubiquitous chaperones that bind and sequester non-native proteins preventing their aggregation. Despite extensive studies of sHSPs chaperone activity, the location of the bound substrate within the sHSP oligomer has not been determined. In this paper, we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) to visualize destabilized mutants of T4 lysozyme (T4L) bound to engineered variants of the small heat shock protein Hsp16.5. In contrast to wild type Hsp16.5, binding of T4L to these variants does not induce oligomer heterogeneity enabling cryoEM analysis of the complexes. CryoEM image reconstruction reveals the sequestration of T4L in the interior of the Hsp16.5 oligomer primarily interacting with the buried N-terminal domain but also tethered by contacts with the α-crystallin domain shell. Analysis of Hsp16.5-WT/T4L complexes uncovers oligomer expansion as a requirement for high affinity binding. In contrast, a low affinity mode of binding is found to involve T4L binding on the outer surface of the oligomer bridging the formation of large complexes of Hsp16.5. These mechanistic principles were validated by cryoEM analysis of an expanded variant of Hsp16.5 in complex with T4L and Hsp16.5-R107G, which is equivalent to a mutant of human αB-crystallin linked to cardiomyopathy. In both cases, high affinity binding is found to involve conformational changes in the N-terminal region consistent with a central role of this region in substrate recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2051804427,"Background In developed countries, primary care physicians manage most patients with depression. Relatively few studies allow a comprehensive assessment of the decisions these doctors make in these cases and the factors associated with these decisions. We studied how general practitioners (GPs) manage the acute phase of a new episode of non-comorbid major depression (MD) and the factors associated with their decisions. Methodology/Principal Findings In this cross-sectional telephone survey, professional investigators interviewed an existing panel of randomly selected GPs (1249/1431, response rate: 87.3%). We used case-vignettes about new MD episodes in 8 versions differing by patient gender and socioeconomic status (blue/white collar) and disease intensity (mild/severe). GPs were randomized to receive one of these 8 versions. Overall, 82.6% chose pharmacotherapy; among them GPs chose either an antidepressant (79.8%) or an anxiolytic/hypnotic alone (18.5%). They rarely recommended referral for psychotherapy alone, regardless of severity, but 38.2% chose it in combination with pharmacotherapy. Antidepressant prescription was associated with severity of depression (OR = 1.74; 95%CI = 1.33–2.27), patient gender (female, OR = 0.75; 95%CI = 0.58–0.98), GP personal characteristics (e.g. history of antidepressant treatment: OR = 2.31; 95%CI = 1.41–3.81) and GP belief that antidepressants are overprescribed in France (OR = 0.63; 95%CI = 0.48–0.82). The combination of antidepressants and psychotherapy was associated with severity of depression (OR = 1.82; 95%CI = 1.31–2.52), patient's white-collar status (OR = 1.58; 95%CI = 1.14–2.18), and GPs' dissatisfaction with cooperation with mental health specialists (OR = 0.63; 95%CI = 0.45–0.89). These choices were not associated with either GPs' professional characteristics or psychiatrist density in the GP's practice areas. Conclusions/Significance GPs' choices for treating severe MD complied with clinical guidelines better than those for mild MD; GPs rarely recommended psychotherapy alone but rather as a complement to pharmacotherapy. Their decisions were mainly influenced by personal life experience and attitudes regarding treatment more than by professional characteristics. These results call into question the methods and content of continuing medical education in France about MD management."
https://openalex.org/W2036619231,"Ammonia secretion by the collecting duct (CD) is critical for acid-base homeostasis and, when defective, causes distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). The Rhesus protein RhCG mediates NH(3) transport as evident from cell-free and cellular models as well as from Rhcg-null mice. Here, we investigated in a Rhcg mouse model the metabolic effects of Rhcg haploinsufficiency, the role of Rhcg in basolateral NH(3) transport, and the mechanisms of adaptation to the lack of Rhcg. Both Rhcg(+/+) and Rhcg(+/-) mice were able to handle an acute acid load, whereas Rhcg(-/-) mice developed severe metabolic acidosis with reduced ammonuria and high mortality. However, chronic acid loading revealed that Rhcg(+/-) mice did not fully recover, showing lower blood HCO(3)(-) concentration and more alkaline urine. Microperfusion studies demonstrated that transepithelial NH(3) permeability was reduced by 80 and 40%, respectively, in CDs from Rhcg(-/-) and Rhcg(+/-) mice compared with controls. Basolateral membrane permeability to NH(3) was reduced in CDs from Rhcg(-/-) mice consistent with basolateral Rhcg localization. Rhcg(-/-) responded to acid loading with normal expression of enzymes and transporters involved in proximal tubular ammoniagenesis but reduced abundance of the NKCC2 transporter responsible for medullary accumulation of ammonium. Consequently, tissue ammonium content was decreased. These data demonstrate a role for apical and basolateral Rhcg in transepithelial NH(3) transport and uncover an incomplete dRTA phenotype in Rhcg(+/-) mice. Haploinsufficiency or reduced expression of RhCG may underlie human forms of (in)complete dRTA."

PPARγ transactivation of KLF4 has been demonstrated in various studies; however, how PPARγ regulates KLF4 expression is not clear. In this study, we reveal that PPARγ regulates the expression of KLF4 by binding directly to the PPAR response element (PPRE) within the KLF4 promoter. The PPRE resides at −1657 to −1669 bp upstream of the KLF4 ATG codon, which is essential for the transactivation of troglitazone-induced KLF4 expression. Furthermore, we found that stable silencing of KLF4 obviously suppressed the G1/S arrest and anti-proliferation effects induced by PPARγ ligands. Taken together, our data indicate that up-regulation of KLF4 upon PPARγ activation is mediated through the PPRE in the KLF4 promoter, thus providing further insights into the PPARγ signal transduction pathway as well as a novel cancer therapeutic strategy.Background: PPARγ serves as a master transcriptional regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism, but it also plays an important role in carcinogenesis.Results: Up-regulation of KLF4 upon PPARγ activation is mediated through the PPRE in the KLF4 promoter.Conclusion: KLF4 partly mediates PPARγ-induced cell proliferation inhibition.Significance: This study provides further insights into the PPARγ signal transduction pathway as well as a novel cancer therapeutic strategy. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a subgroup of ligand-activated nuclear receptors, plays critical roles in cell cycle regulation, differentiation, apoptosis, and invasion. PPARγ is involved in tumorigenesis and is a potent target for cancer therapy.

Like other members of this superfamily, PPARs mediate transcriptional regulation by binding to their central DNA domain, which recognizes response elements in the promoters of specific target genes (2Kersten S.

However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate anticancer effects of dual PPARγ agonists in either a PPARγ-dependent or PPARγ-independent manner are not yet clear, and further studies for the identification of a unique PPARγ target gene are required. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor retinoid X receptor PPAR response element 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 troglitazone rosiglitazone pioglitazone dimethyl sulfoxide quantitative PCR 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt. The Krüppel-like family of zinc finger transcription factors regulates numerous biological processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, development, and inflammation. It is reported to have a dual function as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on the types of tissues in which it is expressed. Increased expression of KLF4 was reported in the ductal carcinoma of breast cancer and oral squamous cell carcinomas (16Foster K.W. Frost A.R. McKie-Bell P. Lin C.Y. Engler J.A. Grizzle W.E.

In contrast, KLF4 is down-regulated in many human cancers, including esophageal, colorectal, bladder, and lung cancer and lymphoma (18Wang N. Liu Z.H. Ding F. Wang X.Q. Zhou C.N. Wu M.

In line with a tumor suppressor function of KLF4, it has been found that KLF4 is down-regulated by promoter hypermethylation and loss of heterozygosity in colorectal cancer, and its overexpression reduces tumorigenesis in colon cancer cells in vivo (19Wei D. Kanai M. Huang S. Xie K. Emerging role of KLF4 in human gastrointestinal cancer.Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Dang D.T. Chen X. Feng J. Torbenson M.

These studies indicate that KLF4 negatively regulates cell cycle progression, but the mechanisms of by which KLF4 affects tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer have yet to be elucidated. It has been shown that some PPARγ agonists up-regulate the expression of KLF4 in colon cancer cells (24Rageul J. Mottier S. Jarry A. Shah Y. Théoleyre S. Masson D. Gonzalez F.J. Laboisse C.L.

However, the mechanisms by which how PPARγ agonists active the expression of KLF4 are still unknown. Bearing in mind growth inhibition of KLF4, it might be interesting to increase KLF4 expression in these cancer cells by activating PPARγ. In this study, we demonstrated that KLF4 is a direct transcriptional target of PPARγ. Computer-aided transcription factor-binding site analysis identified one consensus PPRE at −1657 to −1669 bp upstream of the KLF4 ATG codon. Further analysis by ChIP, EMSA, and luciferase reporter assay revealed that PPARγ can specifically bind to the PPRE in the promoter region of KLF4, which is required for PPARγ to transactivate KLF4. Furthermore, we found that stable silencing of KLF4 obviously suppressed the G1/S arrest and anti-proliferation effects induced by PPARγ ligands, providing further insights into the PPARγ signal transduction pathway as well as a novel cancer therapeutic strategy. TGZ, RGZ, ciglitazone, PGZ, 15d-PGJ2, GW9662, WY14643, and GW0742 were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). All synthetic ligands were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The final DMSO concentration in the culture medium in all experiments was kept constant at 0.1%. Unless stated otherwise, cells were exposed to these ligands for 24 h. HEK293, HCT116, HT29, LoVo, and HCT15 cells were maintained in DMEM and RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. siRNAs (Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) targeting PPARγ (GCCCTTCACTACTGTTGAC) and a control siRNA (AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) were used at 50 nmol/liter. Stable silencing of KLF4 was achieved using the shRNA-based vector with the target sequence GGACGGCTGTGGATGGAAA. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for plasmids according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA fragments of the KLF4 and PPARγ cDNA coding regions were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pCDE-HA vector as described previously (26Zhou Q. Hong Y. Zhan Q. Shen Y. Liu Z. Role for Krüppel-like factor 4 in determining the outcome of p53 response to DNA damage.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 8284-8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For generation of the KLF4 promoter-reporters, the KLF4 −2051/+252 (designated as P1) and −1597/+252 (designated as P2) sequences were PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector. Cell lysates were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The following antibodies were used to detect specific proteins: anti-KLF4, anti-p27, anti-p21, anti-PPARγ, and anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-HA (Tiangen Biotech Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). Total RNA was isolated by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and conventional RT-PCR and RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were done using a One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), respectively.

HCT116 cells were transfected with pGL3-Basic (control) or KLF4 gene promoter constructs; 24 h after transfection, cells were left untreated or treated with 10 μm TGZ for 18 h. Luciferase activity was then determined and normalized to an internal cytomegalovirus-Renilla luciferase control. Each experiment was done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. EMSA was performed using a gel shift assay system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Biotin-labeled and unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide probes contained the binding motif of PPARγ (5′-ACGAGTTGTCCTTTGACCTTTACTGG-3′), and unlabeled mutant probes contained a substitution of 2 bp (underlined, 5′-ACGAGTTGTCCTTTGATATTTACTGG-3′ (designated M1) and 5′-ATAAGTTGTCCTTTGACCTTTACTGG-3′ (designated M2)). Briefly, 3 fmol of labeled oligonucleotides was incubated with nuclear extracts (5 μg), which were obtained from HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-PPARγ and pCDE-HA-RXRα using a nuclear extract kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Competitor oligonucleotides were added at a 100-fold molar excess of the labeled probe except where indicated otherwise. In experiments involving antibodies, 2 μg of the anti-PPARγ or anti-HA polyclonal antibody was added to the reaction except where indicated otherwise. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nylon membrane, followed by detection of the biotin-labeled probe by the chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection module (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were exposed to x-ray films to visualize the signal. HCT116 cells were treated with DMSO or TGZ (10 μm) for 24 h and subjected to ChIP with a ChIP assay Kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, VA). Briefly, formaldehyde was used to cross-link proteins with DNA, and cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer. The cell lysate was sonicated to shear the DNA. Chromatin samples were precleared with protein G-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with normal mouse IgG or anti-PPARγ antibody bound to protein G-agarose. Formaldehyde cross-linking was reversed by incubation at 65 °C, followed by proteinase K digestion and DNA purification. qPCR was then performed as described above using specific primers. 4Primer sequences are available upon request. Proliferation was measured using a BrdU cell proliferation ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the instructions of the manufacturer with minor modifications. Briefly, after labeling the cells with BrdU for 1 h, coverslips bearing treated cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and washed with PBS. Coverslips were then treated with 4 n HCl at room temperature for 30 min to denature the DNA, neutralized with 0.1 m sodium borate at room temperature for 5 min, and washed with PBS. A BrdU antibody was added to the coverslips at 37 °C for 1 h. Following washing with PBS, DAPI was added to the coverslips at room temperature for 3 min, after which they were washed with PBS, mounted, and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. Cells were rinsed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), trypsinized, resuspended in McCoy's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, collected by centrifugation, washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, again collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 70% ethanol, and fixed overnight at 4 °C. Cells were pelleted again by centrifugation and resuspended in staining solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 50 μg/ml RNase A, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm EDTA for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cells in DMEM containing 10% fatty acid-free BSA were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 103 cells/well. The cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of 10 μm TGZ, which was renewed daily. CellTiter 96 AQueous (MTS) One Solution reagent (Promega) was added to each well, and absorbance was recorded at 570 nm using a BioTek ELx800 absorbance microplate reader. To examine whether PPARγ influences KLF4 activity, we first analyzed the expression of KLF4 in HCT116 cells treated with TGZ. RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, and Western blot results clearly showed that TGZ induced the expression of KLF4. The expression of KLF4 was detectably increased after TGZ treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). This increase was confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 1C). We subsequently examined the expression of KLF4 upon treatment with different doses of TGZ ranging from 2 to 20 μm, and a dose-dependent stimulation of KLF4 expression by TGZ was observed (Fig. 1D). Additionally, other PPARγ agonists (RGZ, PGZ, and 15d-PGJ2) were tested, and increased KLF4 expression was found as well. In contrast, WY14643 (PPARα ligand) and GW0742 (PPARβ ligand) did not affect KLF4 expression (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that PPARγ agonists can specifically induce KLF4 expression, which is consistent with previous reports (25Cekanova M. Lee S.H. McEntee M.F. Baek S.J. MCC-555-induced NAG-1 expression is mediated in part by KLF4.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 637: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that PPARγ agonists can alter gene expression in a PPARγ-dependent and PPARγ-independent manner. To clarify this, we tested KLF4 expression in wild-type PPARγ cell lines HT29 and LoVo and mutant PPARγ(K422Q) cell line HCT15 after TGZ treatment. RT-qPCR analysis and Western blotting revealed that PPARγ activation led to an increase in KLF4 expression in HT29 and LoVo cells, which was consistent with the change in HCT116 cells, but not in HCT15 cells (Fig. 2A). Additionally, this induction was blocked by cotreatment with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that this induction is PPARγ-dependent. Furthermore, we performed experiments using pCDE-HA-PPARγ or pCDE-HA-PPARγ siRNA to study KLF4 expression in HCT116 cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, PPARγ agonist-induced KLF4 expression was up-regulated upon overexpression of PPARγ and down-regulated in the absence of PPARγ, suggesting partial regulation of KLF4 through PPARγ activation. These results indicate that the expression of KLF4 is regulated, at least in part, in a PPARγ-dependent manner. To determine a direct link between TGZ and KLF4 expression, we performed experiments using cycloheximide to block de novo protein translation to study the expression of KLF4 in HCT116 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, TGZ-induced KLF4 expression was not influenced by cycloheximide treatment, suggesting that KLF4 is directly induced by TGZ and that this regulation may not require de novo protein synthesis. To explore if the increase in KLF4 mRNA levels triggered by TGZ treatment was linked to post-transcriptional regulation, we measured the half-life of KLF4 mRNA by incubating cells with actinomycin D to block de novo gene transcription. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the mRNA stability of KLF4 was not influenced by TGZ treatment (Fig. 3B). To further determine whether up-regulation of KLF4 induced by TGZ was transcriptional regulation, we measured KLF4 pre-mRNA and mRNA levels with or without TGZ treatment by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig. 3C, both KLF4 pre-mRNA and mRNA levels increased after TGZ treatment, suggesting that up-regulation of KLF4 induced by TGZ is the result of transcriptional rather than post-transcriptional events. PPARγ regulates gene transcription via binding to PPREs located in the promoter regions of target genes. To further determine the direct regulation of KLF4 by PPARγ, we searched for putative PPARγ-binding sites in the human KLF4 promoter. Remarkably, we identified one potential PPARγ-binding site located at −1657 to −1669 bp upstream of the KLF4 ATG codon. Moreover, the putative PPRE site is highly conserved among different species (Fig. 4A), suggesting that KLF4 mRNA might be a direct target of PPARγ. To determine whether the putative PPRE is involved in transactivation, we next measured the KLF4 promoter activity using KLF4 gene promoter-reporter construct P1 (with the putative PPRE) and depletion mutant reporter construct P2 (lacking the putative PPRE) (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C (left panel), a 2-fold increase in P1 was seen with TGZ treatment. In contrast, no significant activation of P2 was observed upon treatment with TGZ. Additionally, we performed cotransfection experiments using KLF4 promoter-reporter construct P1 and pCDE-HA-PPARγ or PPARγ siRNA; our data revealed that overexpression of PPARγ significantly activated P1 and that knockdown of PPARγ reduced the promoter activity (Fig. 4C, right panel). These findings demonstrate unequivocally that PPARγ transactivates KLF4 by binding the putative PPRE. To further examine whether PPARγ can bind the putative PPRE of KLF4, EMSA was performed using biotinylated probes and pcDNA3.1-PPARγ and pCDE-HA-RXR vectors expressing PPARγ and HA-tagged RXR protein. The results show that PPARγ bound a single-strand probe containing the putative PPRE of KLF4 (Fig. 4D, lane 2) and that excess specific competitor KLF4 PPRE (with the putative PPRE) inhibited formation of the probe-PPARγ/RXR complex (lane 3), whereas mutant competitor M1 (with the mutant PPRE) failed to inhibit the biotinylated probe binding to PPARγ (lane 4). In contrast, competitor M2, which contained a mutation near the PPRE, inhibited the biotinylated probe binding to PPARγ (Fig. 4D, lane 5). Furthermore, when anti-PPARγ or anti-HA antibody was applied to the probe/protein mixture, the binding was further shifted (Fig. 4D, lanes 6 and 7). These results demonstrate that the putative PPRE of KLF4 represents a bona fide site for the PPARγ-binding site. PPARγ may regulate KLF4 gene transcription in vivo by its binding activity for chromatin. We performed a quantitative ChIP assay using samples with or without TGZ treatment and antibody to PPARγ. The results show that PPARγ specifically bound the promoter region encompassing the PPRE of the KLF4 gene especially after TGZ treatment. In contrast, normal IgG did not precipitate detectable DNA, and the control sequence near the PPRE lost the immunoprecipitation signal (Fig. 4E). This provides additional evidence to support the active role of PPARγ in KLF4 gene transcription in vivo. To determine whether the PPARγ-induced KLF4 increase would modify the expression levels of known KLF4 target genes, we measured the expression levels of p21Waf1, p27Kip1, and cyclins D1 and E2. HCT116 cells stably silenced with KLF4 or control shRNA were used to delineate the role of KLF4 as a mediator of these TGZ-modulatable genes. As shown in Fig. 5A, shRNA markedly inhibited KLF4 mRNA expression following TGZ treatment. The response of the KLF4 target genes to TGZ was determined by real-time RT-qPCR and Western blotting in KLF4 or control shRNA-silenced cells. TGZ treatment resulted in an up-regulation of p21Waf1 and p27Kip1 but not cyclin D1 or E2 in the control shRNA-silenced cells (Fig. 5, B–D, and supplemental Fig. S1). Ablation of KLF4 expression significantly muted the effect of TGZ on the expression of these genes. In an effort to evaluate the biological significance of KLF4 up-regulation by TGZ, we assessed the response of the stable silencing of KLF4 in HCT116 cells to TGZ-mediated cell proliferation inhibition. The growth curves for control and KLF4 shRNA-silenced cells treated with or without TGZ were compared. Ablation of KLF4 expression reduced PPARγ agonist-mediated cell proliferation arrest (Fig. 6A) but had very subtle effects on long-term cell growth arrest both in vitro and in vivo (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). To clarify the mechanisms underlying cell proliferation inhibition, BrdU incorporation and cell cycle analysis were conducted at 48 h post-TGZ treatment. TGZ treatment inhibited DNA synthesis by >50% in the control shRNA-silenced cells as opposed to 20% in the KLF4 shRNA-silenced cells (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. S4). The difference is statistically significant (p < 0.05). Additionally, as shown in Fig. 6C, TGZ-induced G1/S arrest was markedly muted as a result of KLF4 ablation. Taken together with the KLF4 silencing data, our results show the important role of KLF4 up-regulation in mediating the effect of TGZ on cell proliferation inhibition. PPARγ is known as a master transcriptional regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism, but it also plays an important role in carcinogenesis. This receptor has the ability to bind a variety of small lipophilic compounds. In turn, these ligands direct cofactor recruitment to PPARγ, regulating the transcription of genes in a variety of complex metabolic pathways. Indeed, PPARγ ligands such as thiazolidinediones (RGZ, TGZ, and PGZ), which are commonly used in the clinical setting as anti-diabetic medications, are potent and selective activators of PPARγ. The role of thiazolidinediones in growth of cancer cells has been elucidated in some studies. In a phase II study of the use of TGZ in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer, no objective tumor response was observed (27Burstein H.J. Demetri G.D. Mueller E. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Winer E.P. Use of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ ligand troglitazone as treatment for refractory breast cancer: a phase II study.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2003; 79: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, the study was incomplete. On the other hand, it is important to note that neither hormone status of the tumors nor the amount of PPARγ protein was assessed before patients were included in the study. In contrast, some studies have suggested that PPARγ ligands inhibit growth of malignant human cells; cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a broad spectrum of tumor cell lines; and can be used as chemopreventive agents for colon, breast, and prostate carcinogenesis (28Koeffler H.P. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and cancers.Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Another study showed that up-regulation of p27 and p21 plays a role in the regulation of TGZ-induced G1 arrest in colon cancer cell lines (29Ming M. Yu J.P. Meng X.Z. Zhou Y.H. Yu H.G. Luo H.S. Effect of ligand troglitazone on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression and cellular growth in human colon cancer cells.World J. Gastroenterol. 2006; 12: 7263-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, up to now, no functional PPREs were definitively identified in the p27Kip1 and p21Waf1 promoter regions, which means that the regulation of p27 and p21 by PPARγ is indirect, involving other factors. Previous studies showed that some PPARγ agonists induce KLF4 expression in a receptor-dependent manner in colorectal cancer cells (24Rageul J. Mottier S. Jarry A. Shah Y. Théoleyre S. Masson D. Gonzalez F.J. Laboisse C.L. Denis M.G. KLF4-dependent, PPARγ-induced expression of GPA33 in colon cancer cell lines.Int. J. Cancer. 2009; 125: 2802-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Cekanova M. Lee S.H. McEntee M.F. Baek S.J. MCC-555-induced NAG-1 expression is mediated in part by KLF4.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 637: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In line with this, we have shown that TGZ specifically increased KLF4 mRNA and protein levels and that this regulation is direct because the PPARγ-induced expression of KLF4 was not influenced by co-incubation with cycloheximide, suggesting that this regulation does not require de novo protein synthesis. Additionally, our data show that the mRNA stability of KLF4 was not influenced after TGZ treatment by incubating cells with actinomycin D. Furthermore, both KLF4 pre-mRNA and mRNA were induced by TGZ treatment, indicating that the up-regulation of KLF4 induced by TGZ is at the transcriptional level rather than the post-transcriptional level. In contrast, Chen and Tseng (30Chen Z.Y. Tseng C.C. 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 up-regulates Krüppel-like factor 4 expression independently of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signal transduction pathway in HT-29 colon cancer cells.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) concluded that 15d-PGJ2 up-regulates KLF4 expression independently of PPARγ through activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in HT29 colon cancer cells. The differences we have confirmed in ligand-receptor activity may provide an explanation for differences of action in different colorectal cancer cells. Thus, we have shown that TGZ-induced KLF4 expression was abolished in the presence of GW9662, a PPARγ-specific antagonist, suggesting the PPARγ-dependent manner of TGZ-induced KLF4 expression. Remarkably, we identified one functional PPARγ-binding site with computer-assisted transcription factor-binding site analysis. This site is located at −1657 to −1669 bp upstream of the KLF4 ATG codon and is highly conserved among different species. The specificity of the KLF4-binding sites was also confirmed by EMSA and ChIP assay, as shown in Fig. 4 (D and E, respectively). Additionally, our data indicate that PPARγ binds to its PPRE as a heterodimer with RXR. Upon binding a ligand, the conformation of PPARγ is altered and stabilized such that a binding cleft is created, and recruitment of transcriptional coactivators occurs. It has been reported that activation of the PPARγ/RXR heterodimer can generate a synergistic response in inhibiting cell growth in colon cancer cell lines (31Papi A. Rocchi P. Ferreri A.M. Orlandi M. RXRγ and PPARγ ligands in combination to inhibit proliferation and invasiveness in colon cancer cells.Cancer Lett. 2010; 297: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, further work will be necessary to determine whether activation of the PPARγ/RXR heterodimer generates a synergistic response in upon KLF4 expression. Furthermore, luciferase assay demonstrated unequivocally that PPARγ transactivates KLF4 by binding the putative PPRE (Fig. 4C). Notably, the biological function of KLF4 depends on the genetic context, and many studies have shown that the expression of KLF4 is associated with both inhibition and induction of cell proliferation, affecting tumorigenesis both positively and negatively (23Dang D.T. Chen X. Feng J. Torbenson M. Dang L.H. Yang V.W. Overexpression of Krüppel-like factor 4 in the human colon cancer cell line RKO leads to reduced tumorigenicity.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3424-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 32Rowland B.D. Bernards R. Peeper D.S. The KLF4 tumour suppressor is a transcriptional repressor of p53 that acts as a context-dependent oncogene.Nat.

Cancer. 2006; 6: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, recent studies showed that KLF4 is down-regulated during tumorigenesis of the gastrointestinal epithelium and is frequently lost in other human cancer types. Consistent with a tumor suppressor function of KLF4, its overexpression reduces tumorigenesis in colonic cancer cells. Although KLF4 may play a protumorigenic role in other cancer types (16Foster K.W. Frost A.R. McKie-Bell P. Lin C.Y. Engler J.A. Grizzle W.E. Ruppert J.M. Increase of GKLF messenger RNA and protein expression during progression of breast cancer.Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6488-6495PubMed Google Scholar), our data provide evidence that KLF4 has a role as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer. In this study, we have presented three lines of evidence to support the role of KLF4 in mediating the effect of TGZ on inhibition of colorectal cancer cell proliferation. First, TGZ treatment led to a direct induction of KLF4 expression. Second, stable silencing of KLF4 by shRNA significantly diminished the responsiveness to TGZ with respect to the expression of KLF4 target genes p21Waf1 and p27Kip1. Third, ablation of KLF4 expression reduced TGZ-mediated cell proliferation arrest in HCT116 cells. Our preliminary findings indicate that knockdown of PPARγ resulted in down-regulation of KLF4 and increased cell growth (supplemental Fig. S5). Furthermore, we found that TGZ-induced anti-proliferation effects were markedly muted as a result of KLF4 ablation (Fig. 6, A–C). However, it is important to know that KLF4 is one of several transcription factors whose expression is known to be modulated by TGZ treatment. Thus, it is not surprising to find that silencing KLF4 alone may not completely block the effect of TGZ on cell proliferation arrest. Further work will be necessary to identify additional genes involved in this network. In conclusion, our data clearly demonstrate for the first time that PPARγ regulates the expression of KLF4 by binding directly to the PPRE within the KLF4 promoter, leading to activation of a tumor suppressor network in colorectal cancer. Furthermore, our results provide a novel cancer therapeutic strategy and will help define the mechanisms by which PPARγ and KLF4 are involved in colorectal cancer cell biology.

Here, effects of NO on cold stress inhibited pollen germination and tube growth in Camellia sinensis were investigated in vitro. The NO production, NO synthase (NOS)-like activity, cGMP content and proline (Pro) accumulation upon treatment with NO scavenger cPTIO, NOS inhibitor L-NNA, NO donor DEA NONOate, guanylate cyclase (GC) inhibitor ODQ or phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor Viagra at 25°C (control) or 4°C were analyzed. Exposure to 4°C for 2 h reduced pollen germination and tube growth along with increase of NOS-like activity, NO production and cGMP content in pollen tubes. DEA NONOate treatment inhibited pollen germination and tube growth in a dose-dependent manner under control and reinforced the inhibition under cold stress, during which NO production and cGMP content promoted in pollen tubes. L-NNA and cPTIO markedly reduced the generation of NO induced by cold or NO donor along with partly reverse of cold- or NO donor-inhibited pollen germination and tube growth. Furthermore, ODQ reduced the cGMP content under cold stress and NO donor treatment in pollen tubes. Meanwhile, ODQ disrupted the reinforcement of NO donor on the inhibition of pollen germination and tube growth under cold condition. Additionally, Pro accumulation of pollen tubes was reduced by ODQ compared with that receiving NO donor under cold or control condition. Effects of cPTIO and L-NNA in improving cold-treated pollen germination and pollen tube growth could be lowered by Viagra. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of cPTIO and L-NNA on Pro accumulation were partly reversed by Viagra. These data suggest that NO production from NOS-like enzyme reaction decreased the cold-responsive pollen germination, inhibited tube growth and reduced Pro accumulation, partly via cGMP signaling pathway in C. sinensis."

https://openalex.org/W2089373296,"The ErbB2 and TGFβ signaling pathways cooperate to promote the migratory, invasive, and metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells. We previously demonstrated that ShcA is necessary for these synergistic interactions. Through a structure/function approach, we now show that the phosphotyrosine-binding, but not the Src homology 2, domain of ShcA is required for TGFβ-induced migration and invasion of ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells. We further demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation sites within ShcA (Tyr(239)/Tyr(240) and Tyr(313)) transduce distinct and non-redundant signals that promote these TGFβ-mediated effects. We demonstrate that Grb2 is required specifically downstream of Tyr(313), whereas the Tyr(239)/Tyr(240) phosphorylation sites require the Crk adaptor proteins to augment TGFβ-induced migration and invasion. Furthermore, ShcA Tyr(313) phosphorylation enhances tumor cell survival, and ShcA Tyr(239)/Tyr(240) signaling promotes endothelial cell recruitment into ErbB2-expressing breast tumors in vivo, whereas all three ShcA tyrosine residues are required for efficient breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Our data uncover a novel ShcA-dependent signaling axis downstream of TGFβ and ErbB2 that requires both the Grb2 and Crk adaptor proteins to increase the migratory and invasive properties of breast cancer cells.

Cells exist and thrive in environments that are both supportive of life and potentially hostile. The environment is in a constant state of change and the onset of stress conditions, such as nutrient depravation and exposure to toxins, require appropriate adaptation strategies. Cells have evolved a variety of mechanisms to appropriately sense and respond to variations in the environment through induction of stress pathways and adjustments in metabolism. Yet, in some cases, cells respond by modifying the microenvironment itself to enhance its suitability for their fitness and survival. The pathogen Plasmodium falciparum, for example, is known to secrete a variety of proteins that enhance the permeability of the red blood cell membrane to increase the availability of nutrients (1Mbengue A.

Sod2p was suggested to affect ammonia signaling, but through an unknown pathway (19Cáp M. Váchová L. Palková Z.

Superoxide dismutases (SODs) 3The abbreviations used are: SODsuperoxide dismutaseTCAtricarboxylic acidBCPbromocresol purplePQparaquatBCGbromocresol greenSDHsuccinate dehydrogenase. represent a family of metalloenzymes responsible for detoxifying superoxide radicals generated as a by-product of aerobic metabolism. Most eukaryotes, including S. cerevisiae, contain both a Mn-SOD2 in the mitochondrial matrix as well as, a Cu,Zn-containing SOD1 that is largely cytosolic but also found in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (22Sturtz L.A.

The presence of SODs on both sides of the mitochondrial inner membrane collectively protect against superoxide generated by the electron transport chain. The importance of SOD2 in guarding against mitochondrial oxidative damage has been underscored in various model organisms for SOD2 deficiency. SOD2−/SOD2− mice are neonatal lethal and early death in this case is thought to arise from severe oxidative damage to the mitochondrial respiratory chain (24Melov S. Coskun P. Patel M. Tuinstra R.

In the bakers' yeast S. cerevisiae, cells lacking Sod2p are viable but are highly sensitive to hyperoxia and redox cycling agents (27Outten C.E. Falk R.L. Culotta V.C.

However, the means by which loss of yeast mitochondrial matrix Sod2p can control extracellular pH as described earlier (19Cáp M. Váchová L. Palková Z.

Here, we describe a new connection between mitochondrial superoxide and the control of environmental pH. Specifically we find that the acid burst produced by cells during long-term respiratory conditions can be induced by mitochondrial superoxide. With either mutation in yeast SOD2 or by treatment with the redox cycler paraquat, the acid burst is accelerated in yeast cells starved for glucose. Moreover, the acid burst is eliminated through Mn-antioxidants that act as SOD mimics and remove intracellular superoxide. We provide evidence that superoxide damage to Fe-S enzymes in the TCA cycle results in massive production of acetate involving the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase Ald4p. The concomitant acetate burst during nutrient starvation provides a new carbon source to enhance cell growth during long-term nutrient depravation. The yeast strains in this study were all derived from the parent strain BY4741 (MATa, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, LYS2, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0). Strains with single gene deletions were obtained from the MATa haploid deletion library (Open Biosystems) and verified by sequencing in earlier studies (27Outten C.E. Falk R.L. Culotta V.C.

Strain JAB069 (ald4::kanMX, sdh4::HIS3) was created by transformation of ald4Δ with a PCR-based sdh4::HIS3 deletion cassette generated by amplifying HIS3 from pRS403 (34Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

To examine the effects of yeast colony growth on extracellular pH, solid growth medium containing 3% glycerol (or where indicated, 2% glucose), 1% yeast extract, 0.01% bromocresol purple (BCP; Sigma, B5880), and 2% bacto-agar was prepared precisely as described by Palkova and co-workers (15Palková Z. Janderová B. Gabriel J. Zikánová B. Pospísek M. Forstová J. Ammonia mediates communication between yeast colonies.Nature. 1997; 390: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), except supplemental CaCl2 was generally omitted. pH was typically adjusted to 5.75 with HCl prior to autoclaving but could range from 4.35 (enhance detection of media alkalization) to 6.5 (enhance detection of media acidification) without altering the cell alkaline and acid phases. When needed, the specified concentrations of paraquat (MP Biomedicals) or MnCl2 were added immediately before pouring. In all cases, extracellular pH was monitored using “giant colony” growth as prescribed by Palkova et al. (15Palková Z. Janderová B. Gabriel J. Zikánová B. Pospísek M. Forstová J. Ammonia mediates communication between yeast colonies.Nature. 1997; 390: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) where 2 × 105 cells in 10 μl were spotted onto plates and incubated at 30 °C. Images were taken with a Sony Cybershot DSC-F828 on the days indicated. Cell viability measurements were obtained by removing cells at the designated times and measuring colony-forming units on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) averaged over 3 giant colonies as described (20Palková Z. Váchová L. Gásková D. Kucerová H. Synchronous plasma membrane electrochemical potential oscillations during yeast colony development and aging.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2009; 26: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Results were normalized to WT at day 4. WT and sod2Δ strains retain full viability through day 8 and at day 11 exhibited 92 (S.D. ± 8) and 89% (S.D. ± 11) viability, respectively. For monitoring effects of yeast growth under low glucose conditions, cells were inoculated at an initial A600 = 0.05 and grown shaking at 220 rpm, at 30 °C for 24 h in a liquid media consisting of 1% yeast extract and 0.2% glucose, adjusted to pH 5.5 with HCl. To determine the extracellular pH of these cultures, a colorimetric assay based on the pH-sensitive dyes BCP and bromocresol green (BCG; Sigma, 114359) was developed. Briefly, cells were removed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 1 min and the media was collected (90 μl each) in triplicate and applied to a 96-well plate. Water (blank), 0.1% BCP, or 0.1% BCG (10 μl) were added and absorbance was measured at A430, A589, A514, and A616 in a Synergy HT Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek). pH was calculated by subtracting the absorbance of the blank at each wavelength and using the following empirically derived equations. For BCP (pH ≥ 5.3), pH=5.852+1.081×LOG⁡(A589A430)(Eq. 1) For BCG (pH < 5.3), pH=4.590−LOG(5.963(A616A514)−0.045−1)(Eq. 2) Plates were imaged on an HP Scanjet 8200 scanner. For conditioned media tests, cultures from low glucose conditions as described earlier were filter-sterilized (Millipore, Millex-GV, 0.22 μm) to remove cells and the conditioned medium collected was then used for inoculation of WT cells at A600 = 0.1 followed by aerobic growth for the indicated time points. To measure glucose, acetate, and succinate concentrations in media, conditioned medium was collected from cells grown in low glucose as described earlier and cells were removed by centrifugation. Measurements were performed with a Synergy HT Multi-Mode Microplate Reader using the QuantiChromTM Glucose Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems), the Acetic Acid kit (R-Biopharm), and the Succinic Acid kit (R-Biopharm), respectively, according to the manufacturers' specifications. To adapt the Acetic Acid and Succinic Acid kits to a plate reader format, one-tenth the recommended volumes were used and each reading was path length corrected using the standard correction of the plate reader: (A977 − A900)/0.18. Intracellular acetate measurements were performed in the same manner as those for media, except cells were first lysed by glass bead homogenization in 20 mm potassium phosphate, 1.2 m sorbitol, 1.0 mm PMSF, pH 7.4, and clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 10 min. After determining the total protein by Bradford assay, lysates were heated 15 min at 85 °C and the supernatant was collected for analysis after a second centrifugation. Intracellular acetate concentrations were normalized to total protein. To measure intracellular metabolites of the TCA cycle, cells grown as described earlier in low glucose media were harvested at A600 = 1–1.2 and washed in PBS. Cells were resuspended in PBS at a ratio of 5 μl of PBS/A600 cells and lysed by glass bead homogenization as described (36Gleason J.E. Corrigan D.J. Cox J.E. Reddi A.R. McGinnis L.A. Culotta V.C. Analysis of hypoxia and hypoxia-like states through metabolite profiling.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e24741Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 10 min and total protein was determined by Bradford assay. Duplicate samples were analyzed by stable-isotope dilution GC-MS by the Kennedy Krieger Institute Biochemical Genetics Laboratory. For measurements of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, cells were collected from low glucose liquid media (10 ml) after 24 h growth by centrifugation or scraped from glycerol plates containing BCP (2–9 × 108 cells collected from strains plated as in Fig. 1A) on the days indicated and stored at −20 °C. Cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm potassium phosphate, 1.2 m sorbitol, 1.0 mm PMSF, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, at a ratio of 10 μl of buffer/2 × 107 cells and lysed by glass bead homogenization. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay and enzymatic assay measurements were performed with 10–50 μg of lysate protein per reaction. Aconitase activity was measured as described (36Gleason J.E. Corrigan D.J. Cox J.E. Reddi A.R. McGinnis L.A. Culotta V.C. Analysis of hypoxia and hypoxia-like states through metabolite profiling.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e24741Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in 250 μl of total reaction volume and calculated as the nanomoles of cis-aconitate consumed per mg of protein per min using the Beer-Lambert law and an extinction coefficient of 4.88 mm−1 cm−1. SDH activity was measured with the procedure of Ackrell et al. (37Ackrell B.A. Kearney E.B. Singer T.P. Mammalian succinate dehydrogenase.Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 466-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), adapted to a 200-μl 96-well plate format. Briefly, SDH in whole cell lysates was activated at 30 °C for 10 min in the reaction mixture without electron acceptors/dyes (178 μl volume; final concentration after addition of dyes = 20 mm potassium phosphate, 20 mm succinate or malonate, 1 mm KCN, pH 7.4). After 10 min, pre-warmed dyes (22 μl volume; final concentration in complete reaction mix = 1 mm phenazine methosulfate (Sigma), 0.05 mm 2,6-dichlorindophenol (Sigma)) were added to initiate the reaction. SDH activity was calculated as the malonate-sensitive nanomoles of 2,6-dichlorindophenol reduced per mg of protein per minute using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1. For Pma1p ATPase activity, cells were grown in 1% yeast extract with 2 or 0.2% glucose, pH 5.5 to an A600 = 0.75–0.9. Plasma membranes were isolated (38Perlin D.S. Harris S.L. Seto-Young D.

Chem. 1989; 264: 21857-21864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Pma1p ATPase activity was measured by assaying orthovanadate-sensitive release of inorganic phosphate precisely as described by Monk et al. (39Monk B.C. Kurtz M.B. Marrinan J.A. Perlin D.S. Cloning and characterization of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase from Candida albicans.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6826-6836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and normalized to the activity of WT cells grown in 0.2% glucose. Extracellular pH in yeast growth medium is readily monitored by pH indicators such as BCP and BCG. When grown in high glucose, fermenting yeast cells rapidly acidify the medium (Fig. 1A top), but when grown on non-fermentable carbon sources, the respiring yeast cells initially elevate the extracellular pH (Fig. 1A, middle and bottom). As prescribed by Čáp et al. (19Cáp M. Váchová L. Palková Z. Yeast colony survival depends on metabolic adaptation and cell differentiation rather than on stress defense.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32572-32581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), this alkalization is observed on glycerol medium supplemented with 30 mm calcium (Fig. 1A, middle), yet is also seen without added calcium (Fig. 1A, bottom); hence all subsequent studies were conducted in the absence of calcium supplements. Alkalization of the growth medium is not unique to non-fermentable carbon sources, but is also observed in liquid cultures with low glucose, conditions where cells switch from fermentation to respiration (8Burtner C.R. Murakami C.J. Kennedy B.K. Kaeberlein M. A molecular mechanism of chronological aging in yeast.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1256-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Cells grown in 0.2% glucose rapidly deplete their glucose (Fig. 1C) and the pH of the extracellular medium rises from 5.5 to ≥7.0 within 24 h (Fig. 1B). Following long-term growth on glycerol containing medium, S. cerevisiae cells can enter an acid phase as previously described, which we refer to herein as the acid burst (Fig. 2) (17Palková Z.

It has been reported that the constitutive activation of POU5F1 is sustained by the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry in ESCs; however, the means by which POU5F1 is epigenetically regulated remains enigmatic. In this study a fluorescence-based reporter system was used to monitor the interplay of 5 reprogramming-associated TFs and 17 chromatin regulators in the transcription of POU5F1. We show the existence of a stoichiometric effect for SOX2, POU5F1, NANOG, MYC and KLF4, in regulating POU5F1 transcription. Chromatin regulators EP300, KDM5A, KDM6A and KDM6B cooperate with KLF4 in promoting the transcription of POU5F1. Moreover, inhibiting HDAC activities induced the expression of Pou5f1 in mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) in a spatial- and temporal- dependent manner. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR (ChIP-qPCR) shows that treatment with valproic acid (VPA) increases the recruitment of Kdm5a and Kdm6a to proximal promoter (PP) and proximal enhancer (PE) of Pou5f1 whereas enrichment of Ep300 and Kdm6b was seen in PP but not PE of Pou5f1 promoter. These findings reveal the interplay between the chromatin regulators and histone modifications in the expression of POU5F1."
https://openalex.org/W1964155423,"Translesion synthesis (TLS) provides a mechanism of copying damaged templates during DNA replication. This potentially mutagenic process may operate either at the replication fork or at post-replicative gaps. We used the example of T-T cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) bypass to determine the influence of polymerase recruitment via PCNA ubiquitylation versus the REV1 protein on the efficiency and mutagenic outcome of TLS. Using mutant chicken DT40 cell lines we show that, on this numerically most important UV lesion, defects in polymerase η or in PCNA ubiquitylation similarly result in the long-term failure of lesion bypass with persistent strand gaps opposite the lesion, and the elevation of mutations amongst successful TLS events. Our data suggest that PCNA ubiquitylation promotes CPD bypass mainly by recruiting polymerase η, resulting in the majority of CPD lesions bypassed in an error-free manner. In contrast, we find that polymerase ζ is responsible for the majority of CPD-dependent mutations, but has no essential function in the completion of bypass. These findings point to a hierarchy of access of the different TLS polymerases to the lesion, suggesting a temporal order of their recruitment. The similarity of REV1 and REV3 mutant phenotypes confirms that the involvement of polymerase ζ in TLS is largely determined by its recruitment to DNA by REV1. Our data demonstrate the influence of the TLS polymerase recruitment mechanism on the success and accuracy of bypass."
https://openalex.org/W2018426727,"Sorting of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins is a complex process in which translocons and proteases function in a concerted way. Many inner membrane proteins insert into the membrane via the TIM23 translocon, and some are then further acted upon by the mitochondrial m-AAA protease, a molecular motor capable of dislocating proteins from the inner membrane. This raises the possibility that the threshold hydrophobicity for the retention of transmembrane segments in the inner membrane is different depending on whether they belong to membrane proteins that are m-AAA protease substrates or not. Here, using model transmembrane segments engineered into m-AAA protease-dependent proteins, we show that the threshold hydrophobicity for membrane retention measured in yeast cells in the absence of a functional m-AAA protease is markedly lower than that measured in its presence. Whether a given hydrophobic segment in a mitochondrial inner membrane protein will ultimately form a transmembrane helix may therefore depend on whether or not it will be exposed to the pulling force exerted by the m-AAA protease during biogenesis."

Changes in mucin-type O-linked glycosylation in breast cancer can result in the expression of truncated core 1-based sialylated glycans rather than the core 2-based glycans observed in normal mammary epithelium cells. This has been shown, in part, to be due to changes in the expression of glycosyltransferases, including the up-regulation of some sialyltransferases. Using the breast cancer cell line T47D, we have shown that PGE2, one of the final products of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway, can induce the mRNA expression of the sialyltransferase α-2,3-sialyltransferase-3 (ST3Gal-I), resulting in increased sialyltransferase activity, demonstrated by a reduction in PNA lectin staining. Induction of COX-2 in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line also results in the increased expression of ST3Gal-I, leading to increased sialylation of the substrate of ST3Gal-I, core 1 Galβ1,3GalNAc. This effect on sialylation could be reversed by the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. The use of siRNA to knock down COX-2 and overexpression of COX-2 in MDA-MD-231 cells confirmed the involvement of COX-2 in the up-regulation of ST3Gal-I. Moreover, analysis of the expression of ST3Gal-I and COX-2 by 74 primary breast cancers showed a significant correlation between the two enzymes. COX-2 expression has been associated with a number of tumors, including breast cancer, where its expression is associated with poor prognoses. Thus, these results suggest the intriguing possibility that some of the malignant characteristics associated with COX-2 expression may be via the influence that COX-2 exerts on the glycosylation of tumor cells.

Oncol. 2004; 25: 937-943PubMed Google Scholar). Dramatic changes occur in glycans attached to serine and threonines in mucin-type O-linkage, and this can be attributed, at least in part, to changes in the expression of key glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of O-glycans (2.Burchell J.M.

O-linked glycosylation has been extensively studied in breast cancer, where a number of tumor-associated glycans are observed (2.Burchell J.M. Mungul A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J.

Bobowski M. Burchell J. Delannoy P. Tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens in breast cancer.Breast Cancer Res. 2010; 12: 204Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). One change involves the expression of sialylated core 1 (NeuAcα2,3Galβ13GalNAc) chains that are barely expressed by normal mammary epithelial cells. The presence of sialylated core 1 chains has been attributed to the overexpression of the sialyltransferase ST3Gal-I 3The abbreviations used are:ST3Gal-Iα-2,3-sialyltransferase-3COX-2cyclooxygenase 2qRT-PCRquantitative real-time PCRPNApeanut agglutininTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. by breast cancer compared with normal mammary epithelial cells, which was originally shown by us (6.Burchell J.

An α2,3 sialyltransferases (ST3Gal I) is elevated in primary breast carcinoma.Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and has since been confirmed by others (8.Potapenko I.O. Haakensen V.D. Lüders T. Helland A. Bukholm I. Sørlie T. Kristensen V.N. Lingjaerde O.C. Børresen-Dale A.L. Glycan gene expression signatures in normal and malignant breast tissue. Possible role in diagnosis and progression.Mol. Oncol. 2010; 4: 98-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Increased expression of ST3Gal-I is sometimes accompanied by the down-regulation of the glycosyltransferase C2GnT1, which competes for the same substrate as ST3Gal-I (9.Dalziel M. Whitehouse C. McFarlane I. Brockhausen I. Gschmeissner S. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Burchell J.M. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. The relative activities of the C2GnT1 and ST3Gal-I glycosyltransferases determine O-glycan structure and expression of a tumour-associated epitope on MUC1.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11007-11015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and is responsible for the initiation of core 2 chains in the mammary gland (Fig. 1). Thus, in the normal mammary gland, the mucin-type O-linked glycans are core 2-based, whereas in breast cancer, sialylated core 1 glycans are found (Fig. 1). We recently demonstrated the importance of ST3Gal-I in mammary tumor development using a murine model. In this model, spontaneous Polyoma middle T (PyMT)-induced mammary tumors developed earlier when human ST3Gal-I was expressed as a transgene driven by the MUC1 promoter to ensure expression of the sialyltransferase in the mammary gland (4.Picco G.

Although sialylated core 1 glycans are not found attached to mucins in the normal mammary gland, they are found on proteins expressed by leukocytes. Moreover, switching from core 1- to core 2-based glycans is often observed at different stages of cell activation. Thus, resting T cells carry sialylated core 1-based glycans but, upon activation, switch to expressing core 2-based glycans (10.Priatel J.J. Chui D. Hiraoka N. Simmons C.J. Richardson K.B. Page D.M.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 8216-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) has shown that dendritic cells change their O-linked glycosylation when induced to mature in vitro. Immature dendritic cells carry core 2 glycans, but upon maturation, stimuli down-regulate C2GnT1 and up-regulate ST3Gal-I, resulting in a change from core 2- to core 1-based glycans (12.Julien S. Grimshaw M.J. Sutton-Smith M. Coleman J. Morris H.R. Dell A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Burchell J.M. O-linked glycosylation is regulated during maturation of dendritic cells and has an impact on their migration.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5701-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One method used for the maturation of dendritic cells in vitro is the addition of tumor necrosis factor α and PGE2 (14.Legler D.F. Krause P. Scandella E. Singer E. Groettrup M.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 6278-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and we demonstrated that PGE2 alone was sufficient for the rapid down-regulation of C2GnT1 and up-regulation of ST3Gal-I (12.Julien S. Grimshaw M.J. Sutton-Smith M. Coleman J. Morris H.R. Dell A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Burchell J.M. O-linked glycosylation is regulated during maturation of dendritic cells and has an impact on their migration.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5701-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PGE2 is the principle metabolic product of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and dysregulation of COX-2 expression results in increased amounts of PGE2. Aberrant expression of COX-2 occurs in cancers, and its association with tumorigenesis is particularly strong for colon and breast cancer (16.Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N.

Sivula A. Lundin J. Lundin M. Salminen T. Haglund C. Joensuu H. Isola J. Prognostic significance of elevated cyclooxygenase-2 expression in breast cancer.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 632-635PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, elevated levels of COX-2 in breast cancers are associated with a poor prognosis and ductal carcinoma in situ recurrence (18.Boland G.P. Butt I.S. Prasad R. Knox W.F. Bundred N.J. COX-2 expression is associated with an aggressive phenotype in ductal carcinoma in situ.Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Studies show that COX-2 is involved in breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (19.Larkins T.L. Nowell M. Singh S. Sanford G.L. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 decreases breast cancer cell motility, invasion and matrix metalloproteinase expression.BMC Cancer. 2006; 6: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21.Costa C.

Pathol. 2002; 55: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and when the enzyme is knocked out, mice develop fewer mammary tumors (22.Stasinopoulos I. O'Brien D.R. Wildes F. Glunde K. Bhujwalla Z.M. Silencing of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibits metastasis and delays tumor onset of poorly differentiated metastatic breast cancer cells.Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of COX-2 in the mammary gland induces tumors (23.Liu C.H. Chang S.H. Narko K. Trifan O.C. Wu M.T. Smith E. Haudenschild C. Lane T.F. Hla T. Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18563-18569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Moreover, although sometimes contradictory, epidemiological evidence suggests a correlation of intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (inhibitors of the COX enzymes) with decreased risk of breast cancer (24.Takkouche B. Regueira-Méndez C. Etminan M. Breast cancer and use of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs: A meta-analysis.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2008; 100: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A phase III clinical trial is now underway to assess the adjuvant benefit of a selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, for the treatment of primary breast cancer (25.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Given these data, we investigated the role of COX-2 in the control of the expression of the sialyltransferase ST3Gal-I in breast cancer. Here we show that the expression of ST3Gal-I can be up-regulated by COX-2 via PGE2 in both estrogen receptor α-positive and -negative cell lines. Moreover, we show that the expression of the two enzymes is positively correlated in primary breast cancers. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the control of ST3Gal-I expression in breast cancer. The breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and T47D were routinely grown in DMEM (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 UI/ml). For experimental procedures, cells were detached from culture flasks using EDTA (2 mm) in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Cell samples were snap-frozen using RNA Later reagent (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey Nagel) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. RNA from primary breast cancers was prepared as described in Julien et al. (26.Julien S. Ivetic A. Grigoriadis A. QiZe D. Burford B. Sproviero D. Picco G. Gillett C. Papp S.L. Schaffer L. Tutt A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Pinder S.E. Burchell J.M. Selectin ligand sialyl-Lewis x antigen drives metastasis of hormone-dependent breast cancers.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 7683-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The tumors were obtained from the Guy's and St. Thomas' Research Breast Tissue Bank. DNased RNA (1–2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed using the Opticon qRT-PCR analysis system (MJ Research), a hot-start PCR that contained the double strand-specific DNA-binding dye SYBR Green I (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 pm of the forward and reverse primers (see below). After 5 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles were performed: 15 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 60 °C, 30 s of extension at 72 °C, and fluorescence detection at 78 °C. A melting curve fluorescence analysis was performed on each sample once the amplification cycles were completed to verify that a single product had been amplified. Each sample was normalized to the housekeeping gene PUM1 (homolog of Pumilio, Drosophila) (27.Lyng M.B. Laenkholm A.V. Pallisgaard N. Ditzel H.J. Identification of genes for normalization of real-time RT-PCR data in breast carcinomas.BMC Cancer. 2008; 8 (2008): 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The fold difference was calculated by subtracting the Ct of the test sample from the control sample to give ΔΔCt and then the fold difference 2−ΔΔCt. The following primers were used: PUM1, 5′GATTATTCAGGCACGCAGGT 3′ (forward) and 5′AGCAGCGCTGATGATGTATG3′ (reverse); COX-2, 5′TGAGCATCTACGGTTTGCTG3′ (forward) and 5′TGCTTGTCTGGAACAACTGC3′ (reverse); ST3Gal-I, 5′ATGAGAGGTTCAACCAGACC3′ (forward) and 5′ATGGTGTCATTCAAGTTATTGG3′ (reverse); and C2GnT1, 5′AGAAGGATACACAAAACGTACC3′ (forward) and 5′ACCTTTCTAGCTAACTGTGCTC3′ (reverse). Cell pellets (10–20 × 106 cells) were lysed in 150 mm sodium chloride, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The protein concentration was measured by Pierce BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). 15 μg of proteins was fractionated by size on SDS 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose sheet paper (Pall Corp.) in 1× SDS transfer buffer. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% skimmed powder milk) and incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human prostaglandin receptor 1,2,3, or 4 antibodies purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma Aldrich) was used to identify beta actin as a loading control. The membrane was then washed three times for 10 min in wash buffer, and an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was added at the appropriate concentration. The protein bands were visualized with an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Cell monolayers were detached using 5 mmol/liter EDTA in PBS. When necessary, cells were treated with 500 mU of type V neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (Sigma-Aldrich) in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells (5 × 105 cells) were stained with PNA (peanut agglutinin) for 1 h. After three washes, samples were incubated with FITC streptavidin antibody (BD Biosciences) for 30 min on ice in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. Cells were then fixed in 1% formaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry using a Coulter EPICS XL cytometer with Expo32 ADC software or a FACScalibur cytometer with Cellquest Pro software. MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently cotransfected with a pECFP-C1 plasmid containing GFP cDNA (Clontech) and the COX-2 plasmid (pCMV6-AC, purchased from Origene) or with the same empty vector (pCMV6-AC without the insert mock-transfected cells). Briefly, cells were seeded in T80 flasks (LAB-TEK Nalge Nunc International) and cultured in standard conditions until they reached 60–70% of confluence. They were transfected with 9 μg of pECF-C1 plasmid and 9 μg pCMV6-AC using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). After transfection, cells were cultured in FCS-containing fresh medium, and after 72 h cells were harvested and gene expression-analyzed by RT-qPCR. The siRNA COX-2 oligos were as described in Stasinopoulos et al. (20.Davies G. Salter J. Hills M. Martin L.-A. Sacks N. Dowsett M. Correlation between cyclooxygenase-2 expression and angiogenesis in human breast cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2651-2656PubMed Google Scholar): Sense, AACAUUCCCUUCCUUCGAAAU and antisense, UUUUGUAAGGGAAGGAAGCUUUA; sense, AACUGCUCAACACCGGAAUUUUU and antisense, UUUUGACGAGUUGUGGCCUUAAAAA. MDA-MB-231 (1 × 106) were seeded in 6-well plates 18 h before treatment in complete DMEM without penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were transfected with COX-2 siRNA using transfection reagent as suggested by the manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 18 h. Statistical analysis was carried out using Graphpad software using the Student's t test calculator. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. For the correlation of ST3Gal-I and COX-2 expression in primary breast cancers, Spearman's rank correlation and Pearson's correlation tests were applied. The estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line T47D expresses the ST3Gal-I enzyme but not C2GnT1 (9.Dalziel M. Whitehouse C. McFarlane I. Brockhausen I. Gschmeissner S. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Burchell J.M. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. The relative activities of the C2GnT1 and ST3Gal-I glycosyltransferases determine O-glycan structure and expression of a tumour-associated epitope on MUC1.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11007-11015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and so the glycans attached to proteins that carry mucin-type O-linked glycans in this cell line are core 1-based (Fig. 1), many being sialylated core 1 (28.Brockhausen I. Yang J.M. Burchell J. Whitehouse C. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Mechanisms underlying aberrant glycosylation of MUCl mucin in breast cancer cells.Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To determine whether ST3Gal-I expression can be induced in T47D by PGE2, the cells were incubated with exogenous PGE2 (0.1 μm) for 4 h, and the expression of ST3Gal-I was measured by qRT-PCR. Fig. 2A shows that exogenous PGE2 could increase the expression of ST3Gal-I RNA at least 3-fold. To examine whether this increase in ST3Gal-I RNA expression translated to increased protein expression and so increased enzyme activity, the presence of ST3Gal-I substrate (core 1, Galβ1,3GalNAc) was measured by PNA binding. PNA is a lectin that binds core 1, but the binding is inhibited when sialic acid is added in an α 2,3 linkage to the galactose. As can be seen in Fig. 2B, the binding of PNA to the surface of T47D cells was decreased when the cells were incubated with PGE2. These data indicate that PGE2 induction of ST3Gal-I mRNA leads to an increase in ST3Gal-I activity. COX-2 expression in breast cancer has been associated with both ER+ and ER- breast cancers (17.Ristimäki A. Sivula A. Lundin J. Lundin M. Salminen T. Haglund C. Joensuu H. Isola J.

Therefore, to extend this observation to breast cancers of different phenotypes, we used the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. This cell line also has the advantage that it expresses the core 2-initiating enzyme C2GnT1, which competes with ST3Gal-I for the same substrate. However, in MDA-MB-231 cells, the addition of exogenous PGE2 did not affect the expression of ST3Gal-I or C2GnT1 (data not shown). Analysis of the expression by MDA-MB-231 and T47D of the two PGE2 receptors most associated with carcinogenesis, EP2 and EP4 (30.Pan M.-R. Hou M.-F. Chang H.-C. Hung W.-C.

EP2 and EP4 differ in their sensitivity to PGE2. EP4 is desensitized after short-term exposure, and this, coupled with the rapid metabolism of PGE2 (33.Nishigaki N. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Two Gs-coupled prostaglandin E receptor subtypes, EP2 and EP4, differ in desensitization and sensitivity to the metabolic inactivation of the agonist.Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1031-1037PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Fitzpatrick F.A. Aguirre R. Pike J.E. Lincoln F.H. The stability of 13,14-dihydro-15 keto-PGE2.Prostaglandins. 1980; 19: 917-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), may explain the lack of response to exogenous PGE2 of MDA-MB-231 cells. We therefore investigated the effect of an inducer of COX-2 on this cell line. MDA-MB-231 was incubated with the phorbol ester TPA, which, among its many effects, has been shown to induce COX-2 expression (35.Bourin M.C. Delescluse C. Fürstenberger G. Marks F. Schweizer J. Klein-Szanto A.J. Prunieras M. Effect of phorbol esters on guinea pig skin in vivo.Carcinogenesis. 1982; 3: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR showed an increase in COX-2 mRNA after 18-h exposure to TPA (Fig. 3A). In parallel, ST3Gal-I expression was increased and C2GnT1 expression decreased (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows a time course of treatment of MDA-MB-231 with 10 nm TPA. COX-2 mRNA expression started to rise between 50 and 120 min after the addition of TPA, whereas ST3Gal-I mRNA expression did not start to increase until some time after 120 min following the addition of TPA. The data from the 120-min time point is in agreement with the induction of ST3Gal-I mRNA being indirect through COX-2. Analysis of PNA binding to the cells 72 h after TPA stimulation showed a reduction in PNA binding to TPA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells compared with vehicle-treated, indicating an increase in sialylation of core 1 (Fig. 4A). To confirm that it was sialic acid inhibiting the binding of PNA, cells were treated with neuraminidase. Fig. 4B shows an increased binding to vehicle-incubated cells because of the removal of the basal level of sialic acid on core 1 glycans. As expected, the binding of PNA to TPA-treated cells now overlaps with the vehicle-incubated cells. This confirms that the decrease in PNA binding observed upon TPA treatment was due to sialic acid masking of core 1 and not due to a decrease in the pool of core 1-based structures. To determine whether the increase in ST3Gal-I activity mediated by TPA is working through COX-2, the cells were incubated with the specific inhibitor of COX-2, celecoxib, during the stimulation with TPA. Fig. 4C shows again the decreased binding obtained with PNA when the cells were treated with TPA, but incubation with TPA in the presence of celecoxib returned the PNA binding to that observed with vehicle alone, strongly suggesting that TPA was increasing ST3Gal-I mRNA and activity via COX-2 induction. To further confirm that COX-2 was inducing the expression of ST3Gal-I, COX-2 was silenced by siRNA in MDA-MD-231 cells during incubation with TPA. Fig. 5A shows that COX-2 expression could be inhibited by 75% by two siRNAs and that this resulted in a 50% inhibition of ST3Gal-I mRNA expression (B). Moreover, overexpression of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 by transfection of COX-2 cDNA resulted in increased COX-2 expression and increase ST3Gal-I expression (Fig. 5, C and D). To investigate the clinical significance of our findings, we determined the expression of COX-2 and ST3Gal-I mRNA by RT-PCR in 74 primary breast cancers obtained from the Guy's and St. Thomas' Research Breast Tissue Bank. Fig. 6 shows a plot of the results and the line drawn from the least squares regression to graphically represent the correlation. We used the Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient to measure the significance of the correlation, which gave a coefficient of 0.274 with a p value of 0.015. We also applied the Spearman's rank correlation test to the data, which gave a correlation of 0.309 with a p value of 0.00593. Thus, both tests confirmed the presence of a moderate but statistically significant correlation in the expression of the two enzymes. Increased expression, relative to normal tissue, of ST3Gal-I is observed in many carcinomas, especially colon (36.Kudo T. Ikehara Y. Togayachi A. Morozumi K. Watanabe M. Nakamura M. Nishihara S.

This suggests that the transcriptional regulation of this sialyltransferase is altered during malignant transformation. Here we have shown that in two breast cancer cell lines, transcription of ST3Gal-I is increased by COX-2 or its product, PGE2. This increase in mRNA expression leads to increased activity of ST3Gal-I, as demonstrated by decreased binding of the lectin PNA, which binds to the substrate of ST3Gal-I (Galβ1,3GalNAc, also known as the Thomsen–Friedenreich (TF) antigen). Moreover, we have shown that there is a significant correlation between COX-2 expression and ST3Gal-I expression in primary breast cancers, indicating that our findings have clinical significance. Nearly all proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane or are secreted carry glycans that are involved in cell adhesion, recognition, molecular trafficking, clearance, and signaling (38.Ohtsubo K. Marth J.D. Glycosylation in cellular mechanisms of health and disease.Cell. 2006; 126: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). Aberrant glycosylation occurs in essentially all types of human cancer and appears to be an early event as well as playing a key role in the induction of invasion and metastases (1.Hakomori S.

Changes in glycosylation that occur in cancer can also alter molecular interactions with the immune system (39.Napoletano C. Rughetti A. Agervig Tarp M.P. Coleman J. Bennett E.P. Picco G. Sale P.

Thus, increased expression of ST3Gal-I, which can result in the expression of truncated sialylated glycans, could play an important role in the promotion and progression of cancer. In support of this, we have shown previously that overexpressing ST3Gal-I in the mammary gland can promote the early development of spontaneous mammary tumors in a murine model (4.Picco G. Julien S. Brockhausen I. Beatson R. Antonopoulos A. Haslam S. Mandel U. Dell A. Pinder S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Burchell J. Over-expression of ST3Gal-I promotes mammary tumorigenesis.Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Until now, very little was known about the control of expression of ST3Gal-I in breast cancer cells. Analysis of the promoter region of ST3Gal-I has identified binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factors SP1 and USF. However, mutational studies confirm that other factors must play a role (40.Taniguchi A. Yoshikawa I. Matsumoto K.

In porcine kidney cells, transcriptional activation of this sialyltransferase can be induced by TGF-β1 (41.Son S.W. Song K.H. Kwon H.Y. Kim K.S. Kim C.H. Oh K.B. Choo Y.K. Lee Y.C. Transcriptional activation of pig Galβ1,3GalNAc α2,3-sialyltransferase (pST3Gal I) gene by TGF-β1 in porcine kidney PK-15 cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 414: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and in the colon carcinoma cell line HT-29, tumor necrosis factor α can enhance ST3Gal-I expression through NFκB binding sites (31.Higai K. Ishihara S. Matsumoto K. NF-κB-p65-dependent transcriptional regulation of glycosyltransferases in human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 by stimulation with tumor necrosis factor α.Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2006; 29: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We now show that increased expression of ST3Gal-I in breast cancer cells can be induced by COX-2 working through the prostanoid PGE2. Further studies will be required to demonstrate the transcript factors involved. COX-2 is undetectable in most normal tissues but is induced by inflammation when activated macrophages and other cells at sites of inflammation express it. However, COX-2 expression is also turned on in many cancers, and increased expression has been reported in colon (16.Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N.

Clinical trials investigating the efficacy of the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib are now underway in colon, breast, and bladder cancer, and it would be interesting to measure the expression of ST3Gal-I in tumors from these patients. The results described here suggest the intriguing possibility that some of the malignant characteristics associated with COX-2 expression may be via the influence that COX-2 exerts on the glycosylation of tumor cells.

In the absence of NQO1 as can occur by genetic mutation, the human airway is protected from harmful effects of ozone. We recently reported that NQO1-null mice are protected from airway hyperresponsiveness and pulmonary inflammation following ozone exposure. However, NQO1 regenerates intracellular antioxidants and therefore should protect the individual from oxidative stress. To explain this paradox, we tested whether in the absence of NQO1 ozone exposure results in increased generation of A2-isoprostane, a cyclopentenone isoprostane that blunts inflammation. Using GC-MS, we found that NQO1-null mice had greater lung tissue levels of D2- and E2-isoprostanes, the precursors of J2- and A2-isoprostanes, both at base line and following ozone exposure compared with congenic wild-type mice. We confirmed in primary cultures of normal human bronchial epithelial cells that A2-isoprostane inhibited ozone-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8 regulation. Furthermore, we determined that A2-isoprostane covalently modified the active Cys179 domain in inhibitory κB kinase in the presence of ozone in vitro, thus establishing the biochemical basis for A2-isoprostane inhibition of NF-κB.

Consistent with this epidemiologic data, we reported that compared with congenic C57BL/6 wild-type mice NQO1-null mice were protected from ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation. Paradoxically, following ozone exposure, NQO1-null mice produced significantly less F2-isoprostane, a non-enzymatic peroxidation product of arachidonic acid that is a stable biomarker of oxidant stress (22Voynow J.A. Fischer B.M. Zheng S. Potts E.N. Grover A.R. Jaiswal A.K. Ghio A.J. Foster W.M. NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 is essential for ozone-induced oxidative stress in mice and humans.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 41: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results were unexpected because absence of NQO1 should increase oxidative stress postozone exposure. Therefore, we investigated why there was a difference in F2-isoprostane production in wild-type versus NQO1-null mice and whether the difference in isoprostane production affected pulmonary responses to ozone. Isoprostanes (isoPs) are formed by the non-enzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid. They are named according to the prostaglandin isomer closest in structure. F2-isoPs (isomers of PGF2α) are chemically stable molecules that are accepted as a “gold standard” biomarker of endogenous oxidative stress. IsoPs with an E2 or D2 ring are also generated in vivo (23Reich E.E. Markesbery W.R. Roberts 2nd, L.J. Swift L.L. Morrow J.D. Montine T.J.

A2-/J2-isoPs contain a highly reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group on the cyclopentenone ring that readily adducts thiols via Michael addition, which allows these molecules to exert potent biological activities. For example, A2-isoPs have been reported to inhibit activation of NF-κB, suggesting that they have an anti-inflammatory function (25Musiek E.S. Gao L. Milne G.L. Han W. Everhart M.B. Wang D.

In this study, we tested whether NQO1-null mice generated greater levels of E2/D2-isoPs, the A2/J2 precursors, following ozone exposure compared with control mice. We also tested whether A2-isoPs inhibited ozone-triggered NF-κB activation and IL-8 expression in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells.

Experiments were performed on days 10–14 after the change of the culture condition to ALI. NHBE cells were changed to medium supplemented with retinoic acid for 24 h before ozone exposure. Cells were preincubated with A2-isoPs (provided by Dr. Ginger Milne or Cayman Biochemical; 50 nm or 2.5 μm) or the equivalent volume of control vehicle (N2-purged ethanol) and then co-incubated with ozone or filtered air (FA) (see “Ozone Exposure” below). C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). A breeding colony was established at Duke University from breeding pairs of NQO1-null mice (on a C57BL/6J background) obtained from Dr. Frank Gonzalez at the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). Male C57BL/6J or NQO1-null mice were used at 6–8 weeks of age. Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Duke University Medical Center and performed in accordance with the standards established by the United States Animal Welfare Act. Mice were exposed to either ozone (1 ppm) or filtered air for 3 h as reported previously (22Voynow J.A. Fischer B.M. Zheng S. Potts E.N. Grover A.R. Jaiswal A.K. Ghio A.J. Foster W.M.

The ozone concentration in the chamber was continuously monitored with an ozone ultraviolet light photometer (Dasibi model 1003AH, Dasibi Environmental Corp., Glendale, CA). Mouse lungs were harvested 24 h after ozone or filtered air exposure, snap frozen, and stored at −80 °C until lipid extraction for E2-/D2-isoprostane analysis. NHBE cells were exposed to either FA or 0.4 ppm ozone from 30 min to 5 h in exposure chambers; each gas was provided at 20 liters/min balanced with 5% CO2 and at 88% relative humidity. Immediately after the exposure, cells were processed for isolation of total RNA, cell lysate protein, or collection of basolateral medium. By lactate dehydrogenase assay, ozone does not cause cytotoxicity at this concentration or duration of exposure. ELISA (LEGEND MAX kit for human IL-8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA) was performed for IL-8 quantitation in basolateral medium diluted 1:5 or 1:10 according to the manufacturer's instructions. D2-/E2-isoprostanes were analyzed by gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (GC-NICI-MS) using a modification of methods described previously for the analysis of PGE2 and PGD2 (29Awad J.A. Morrow J.D. Takahashi K. Roberts 2nd., L.J. Identification of non-cyclooxygenase-derived prostanoid (F2-isoprostane) metabolites in human urine and plasma.J. Biol.

The sample was then applied to a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge, and compounds were eluted with 10 ml of ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. Compounds were subsequently derivatized by treatment with a 2% solution of aqueous methoxyamine·HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was evaporated under nitrogen. Compounds were converted to a pentafluorobenzyl ester and dried under nitrogen, and the residue was reconstituted in 30 μl of chloroform and 20 μl of methanol and chromatographed on a silica TLC plate to 13 cm in a solvent system of ethyl acetate:methanol (98:2, v/v). The methyl ester of PGF2α and the 0-methyloxime, pentafluorobenzyl ester derivative of PGD2 (∼5 μg each) were chromatographed on a separate lane and visualized with 10% phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol by heating. The Rf of PGF2α methyl ester in this solvent system is ∼0.25, and the Rf of the 0-methyloxime, pentafluorobenzyl ester derivative of PGF2 is ∼0.60. Compounds migrating in the region 1 cm above the PGF2 standard to 0.5 cm below the PGF2 standard were scraped from the TLC plate, extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate, and dried under nitrogen. Following TLC purification, compounds were converted to trimethylsilyl ether derivatives and dried under nitrogen. The residue was redissolved for GC-MS analysis in 10 μl of undecane that had been stored over a bed of calcium hydride. GC-NICI-MS was carried out on an Agilent 5973 Inert Mass Selective Detector coupled with an Agilent 6890n Network GC system interfaced with an Agilent computer. The GC was performed using a 15-m, 0.25-mm-film thickness, DB-1701 fused silica capillary column (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The column temperature was programmed from 190 to 300 °C at 20 °C/min. The major ion generated in the NICI mass spectrum of the pentafluorobenzyl ester, trimethylsilyl ether derivatives of the E2/D2-isoPs was m/z 524, whereas the [2H4]PGE2 internal standard had an m/z of 528. Levels of endogenous eicosanoids in the biological samples were calculated from the ratio of intensities of the [2H0] and [2H4] ions. RNA was isolated from NHBE cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and IL-8 gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real time RT-PCR on an SDS 7300 machine (Applied Biosystems) in a 25-μl reaction that contained 1× TaqMan gene expression assay (mixture of PCR primer set specific for IL-8 and a FAM dye-labeled TaqMan MGB probe) using universal amplification conditions. The amplification reaction of 18 S rRNA control contained 0.2 μm forward primer, 0.2 μm reverse primer, and 0.8 μm VIC dye-labeled Taq-Man MGB probe. Each sample was amplified in duplicate reactions for both the gene of interest and 18 S rRNA control. The relative gene expression level was calculated by the ΔΔCT method, which represents the -fold difference in gene expression corrected for 18 S rRNA control expression, and normalized to the control treated sample (28Zheng S.

Ozone-exposed cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and lysed for 5 min on ice in Cell Lysis Buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) containing both 1× Complete protease (Roche Applied Science) and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). Cultures were then scraped and disrupted mechanically by pipetting and sonication. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C using a tabletop microcentrifuge. Total cellular protein concentrations in each supernatant were determined by Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay. To determine the activation of the NF-κB pathway in NHBE cells exposed to ozone versus filtered air, the phosphorylation of subunit p65 of NF-κB was evaluated. Equal amounts of total proteins (60–100 μg/lane) were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for Western analysis. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% milk powder in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with primary rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to phospho-p65 (Ser536) (diluted 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody, 1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h at room temperature. After two 20-min washes in TBST, immunoreactive protein complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). To confirm equal loading, blots were rehybridized with mouse monoclonal antibody specific to β-actin (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich). The IKK enzyme activity was evaluated in the proteins isolated from ozone (OZ)- or FA-exposed cells. The IKK enzyme was selectively immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total cellular protein in a 500-μl reaction volume of Cell Lysis Buffer containing both 1× Complete protease and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixtures using rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognized IKKα (1:250) and IKKβ (1:50) (Cell Signaling Technology) or rabbit IgG as control. Following overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C, the immune complexes were then precipitated with a 25-μl volume of magnetic Dynabeads protein G (4 °C, 4 h) (Invitrogen). Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and then twice with kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2) (Cell Signaling Technology). The IKK activity assay was initiated by the addition of kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of GST-IκBα as a substrate for the IKK enzyme activity. The kinase reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then stopped by addition of SDS sample loading buffer. The reaction mixture was boiled for 5 min, and aliquots were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western analysis using antibodies to phospho-IκBα (Ser32/36) (mouse monoclonal, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (sheep anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked antibody, 1:2000; GE Healthcare). After two 20-min washes in TBST, immunoreactive protein complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. IKK activity was determined by the intensity of phospho-GST-IκBα (Ser32/36) signals on the autoradiogram. The blots were rehybridized with antibodies against IKKβ (rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody, 1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology), and immunoreactive protein complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The band densities of phosphorylated IκBα were normalized to the corresponding immunoprecipitated IKKβ band densities. To investigate the modification mechanism of the reactive Cys179 residue of IKKβ peptide with isoprostanes, two synthetic 27-amino acid peptides encompassing Glu172–Lys198 of the primary sequence of human IKKβ containing Cys179 residue (WT; Mr 3009.500) and C179A (MUT; Mr 2977.528) were obtained commercially (Invitrogen). These peptides were dissolved in nitrogen-purged N,N-dimethylformamide (5 μg/μl) and stored at −80 °C. An aliquot of 10-μl (50 μg; 166 μm) was further diluted in PBS to obtain a 100-μl reaction volume in a shallow dish and exposed to ozone (0.4 ppm; 30 min) or filtered air in the presence or absence of A2-isoprostane (166 μm) or as a control F2-isoprostane (166 μm). Peptides under each of the conditions were frozen in aliquots at 1 mg/ml at −80 °C for mass spectrometry analysis in the Duke Proteomics Core Facility. Upon thawing, 5 μl of each peptide was transferred into a separate tube, and 15 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to each. Millipore C18 ZipTips® were used according to the manufacturer's protocol to desalt 5 μg of each peptide sample. The samples were vacuum-dried and dissolved in 100 μl of 2:98:0.1 (v/v/v) MeCN/H2O/TFA. Each of the six peptide exposure conditions were analyzed using a nanoAcquity UPLC system coupled to a Synapt G2 HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Approximately 50 ng of peptide material in 1 μl was first trapped at 5 μl/min for 3 min in 99.9% water with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid on a 20-μm × 180-mm Symmetry C18 column. Separations were then performed on a 75-μm × 250-mm column with 1.7-μm C18 Bridged Ethyl Hybrid (BEH) particles (Waters) using a 30-min gradient of 5–40% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.4 μl/min and 55 °C column temperature. The samples were then subjected to MS/MS acquisition in data-dependent analysis mode using a 0.9-s MS scan followed by MS/MS acquisition on the top three ions with charge grea"
https://openalex.org/W2103580949,"The neural cell adhesion molecule L1 plays important roles in neuronal migration and survival, neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis. L1 has also been found in tumors of different origins, with levels of L1 expression correlating positively with the metastatic potential of tumors. To select antibodies targeting the varied functions of L1, we screened the Tomlinson library of recombinant human antibody fragments to identify antibodies binding to recombinant human L1 protein comprising the entire extracellular domain of human L1. We obtained four L1 binding single-chain variable fragment antibodies (scFvs), named I4, I6, I13, and I27 and showed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that scFvs I4 and I6 have high affinity to the immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains 1-4 of L1, while scFvs I13 and I27 bind strongly to the fibronectin type III homologous (Fn) domains 1-3 of L1. Application of scFvs I4 and I6 to human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells reduced proliferation and transmigration of these cells. Treatment of SK-N-SH cells with scFvs I13 and I27 enhanced cell proliferation and migration, neurite outgrowth, and protected against the toxic effects of H(2)O(2) by increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. In addition, scFvs I4 and I6 inhibited and scFvs I13 and I27 promoted phosphorylation of src and Erk. Our findings indicate that scFvs reacting with the immunoglobulin-like domains 1-4 inhibit L1 functions, whereas scFvs interacting with the fibronectin type III domains 1-3 trigger L1 functions of cultured neuroblastoma cells."

https://openalex.org/W2085890168,"Background Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) is able to kill cancer cells via receptor-mediated cell death requiring adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Clinical usage of TNF so far is largely limited by its profound hepatotoxicity. Recently, it was found in the murine system that specific protection of hepatocytes against TNF's detrimental effects can be achieved by fructose-mediated ATP depletion therein. Before employing this quite attractive selection principle in a first clinical trial, we here comprehensively investigated the interdependence between ATP depletion and TNF hepatotoxicity in both in vitro and ex vivo experiments based on usage of primary patient tissue materials. Methods Primary human hepatocytes, and both non-tumorous and tumorous patient-derived primary liver tissue slices were used to elucidate fructose-induced ATP depletion and TNF-induced cytotoxicity. Results PHH as well as tissue slices prepared from non-malignant human liver specimen undergoing a fructose-mediated ATP depletion were both demonstrated to be protected against TNF-induced cell death. In contrast, due to tumor-specific overexpression of hexokinase II, which imposes a profound bypass on hepatocytic-specific fructose catabolism, this was not the case for human tumorous liver tissues. Conclusion Normal human liver tissues can be protected transiently against TNF-induced cell death by systemic pretreatment with fructose used in non-toxic/physiologic concentrations. Selective TNF-targeting of primary and secondary tumors of the liver by transient and specific depletion of hepatocytic ATP opens up a new clinical avenue for the TNF-based treatment of liver cancers."
