Although a relatively high dose of monosodium glutamate was used, the infant was asymptomatic for a 3-hour observation period during which time hypothalamic neurons were undergoing a process of acute cell death. With the electron microscope it was observed that dendrites and cell bodies of neurons are the tissue components primarily affected in brain damage induced by monosodium glutamate."

Similarly, rats pressed a lever for food pellets while free pellets were present. It is not necessary, therefore, to deprive an animal of food before it will engage in instrumental responding for food. Such responding can serve as its own motivation and reward."

https://openalex.org/W1516842478,"Abstract Purified soybean lipoxidase was used to test the substrate specificity of all cis,cis-methylene-interrupted isomers of linoleic acid. The natural 9,12-isomer was found to be the best substrate, and the 13,16-isomer 50% as effective. The presence of calcium ions broadened the pattern of specificity. The rates of reaction of a series of polyunsaturated acids in which chain length, number of double bonds, and positions of double bonds varied were tested with crude lipoxidase in the presence of calcium ion. The substrates which exhibit high rates of reaction all possessed double bonds at the 6th and 9th carbon atoms counting from the methyl group. Thus the terminal structure is critical to the specificity of the enzyme. For enzyme reaction, the carboxyl group must not be sterically hindered, and the unsaturation at the 6th carbon atom from the methyl end of the chain must be a double bond."

https://openalex.org/W1551226986,"Abstract Modification of the carboxyl groups in hen's egg white lysozyme by the carbodiimide-nucleophile procedure developed in this laboratory has shown that all of the carboxyl groups except glutamic 35 can be modified under normal assay conditions. The presence of the substrate protects the aspartic acid residue 52 so that an enzyme with over 50% activity is obtained in which all carboxyls except aspartic 52 and glutamic 35 have been converted to the [see PDF for equation] derivatives. Subsequent treatment after the removal of substrate leads to concomitant modification of aspartic 52 and loss of enzyme activity. These results eliminate all carboxyl residues except glutamic 35 and aspartic 52 as potential catalytic groups or essential binding groups. They add strong support to the hypothesis of Phillips and his coworkers, deduced from crystallographic studies, that these residues are involved in the catalytic action. All other carboxyl groups appear to be on the surface of the protein molecule in terms of accessibility to reagent but individual residues vary in reactivity both in the carboxyl activation step and in the subsequent nucleophilic displacement on the activated carboxyl."

https://openalex.org/W1856489983,"Abstract It was found that the pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is capable of oxidatively decarboxylating α-ketobutyrate at about the rate of 62% of that of pyruvate in the over-all reaction assay and about 79% in the dehydrogenase assay. The complex also shows some activities with α-ketovalerate, α-ketoisocaproate, and α-ketocaproate. These activities were associated with this complex throughout the purification process. The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is highly specific for 2-oxoglutarate, but does also show some activity with α-ketoadipate. The pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was inhibited competitively by α-ketoisovalerate and α-keto-β-methylvalerate with pyruvate, α-ketobutyrate, and α-ketoisocaproate. The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex exhibited mixed inhibition by α-ketoisovalerate, α-keto-β-methylvalerate, and α-ketoisocaproate with 2-oxoglutarate. The significances of the results relative to maple syrup disease are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1501917528,"Abstract 1. Heat capacities from 11–305°K have been measured for crystalline bovine zinc insulin containing 4% water and for crystalline chymotrypsinogen A containing 10.7% water. Both proteins were then studied in the anhydrous state. Heat capacities, entropies, (H° - H0°)/T, and -(G° - H0°)/ T are tabulated as functions of temperature for the anhydrous materials. For the hydrated samples only heat capacities and entropies are tabulated. 2. No elevated heat capacities for the hydrated samples were noted in the region 250–275°K; i.e. there was no evidence of the fusion of ice. Values of the apparent molal heat capacity of water in the proteins are calculated. 3.The average value for the entropy of formation of a peptide bond is 9.3 cal deg-1 per bond for insulin and 9.0 cal deg-1 per bond for chymotrypsinogen A which is close to the value observed in the formation of the bond in dipeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1586317568,"Equilibrium constants of association were determined by a technique based on the principle of equilibrium dialysis but utilizing Sephadex G-25 for the strong binding exhibited by human pregnancy serum (or by the material precipitated from late pregnancy serum by ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation) for: (a) testosterone-1,2-3H, (b) radioinert 17β-estradiol (in competition with testosterone-1,2-3H), and (c) 17β-estradiol-6,7-3H. The respective values for the intrinsic association constant, k, were all quite high: (a) 4.5 × 108M−1, (b) 1.35 × 108M−1, and (c) 0.4 × 108M−1. These findings are in accord with the view that the testosterone-binding component of pregnancy serum also binds 17β-estradiol but not as strongly. The binding of 17β-estradiol by bovine serum albumin, measured by the same technique, gave nk = 9 × 104M−1. Reagents which react with —SH groups, and other reagents which reduce the disulfide bonds, depressed in striking fashion the testosterone-binding activity of pregnancy serum. It is suggested that the testosterone-binding component contains both cysteine and cystine, and that their maintenance intact is important for steroid-binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1510827154,"Abstract To gain insight into reasons for the presence of only five combining sites in γM antibodies, studies were undertaken to determine the number of antigen-binding sites on γM subunits and on Fabµ fragments of a γM rheumatoid factor anti-γ-globulin from a patient with mixed cryoglobulins. The rheumatoid factor contained both κ and λ light chains and reacted with human and rabbit γG. Combining ratios were determined by quantitatively determining the amount of complex formation by analytical ultracentrifugation. Each monomeric subunit had only one effective antigen-binding site, and there were no inactive subunits. All of the 3.7 S Fabµ fragments, prepared by trypsin digestion of the subunits, were active and each had at least one effective binding site per fragment. These results indicate that there are 10 potential combining sites in the intact molecule although only five are available for antigen binding. Studies were performed also on the nature of the cross-reaction of this antibody with rabbit γG. These experiments showed that the amount of complex formed with rheumatoid factor subunits and their antigen was the same whether the antigen consisted of rabbit γG alone, human γG alone, or a mixture of the two. Since there is no evidence for antibody subunits which combine with only one species of γG, the binding sites appear to resemble those in other cross-reacting systems in which each combining site may be occupied by either antigen. In contrast to the excellent binding activity of γM antibody subunits for rabbit γG, Fabµ fragments showed little or no binding activity for rabbit γG."
https://openalex.org/W1481566187,"Abstract 6-3H,6-14C-dl-Lysine was administered in metabolite overloading experiments to the intact rat, to a lysine-less mutant of Neurospora crassa, to intact bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris), and to excised shoots of Sedum acre. Pipecolic acid was then isolated from the tissues. In each case the pipecolic acid showed a 3H:14C ratio which was similar to that of the administered precursor. It follows that, in each case, the conversion of lysine into pipecolic acid proceeds via e-amino-α-ketocaproic acid. α-Aminoadipic-δ-semialdehyde cannot be an intermediate. These results complement earlier findings that, in the rat, the nitrogen atom of pipecolic acid is supplied by the e-amino group of lysine; they provide evidence for a similar route in N. crassa and in higher plants. They conflict with reports that, in higher plants, it is the α-amino group of lysine which supplies the nitrogen atom of pipecolic acid. In S. acre, the doubly labeled lysine was incorporated into sedamine without change in 3H:14C ratio."

The ultraviolet absorption is typical for proteins with an E1%1 cm = 24.8 ± 0.4, and its isoelectric point is weakly alkaline at 7.53. The sedimentation constant (s020,w) of 2.27 ± 0.14 exhibits no apparent concentration dependence, a phenomenon consistent with a symmetrical sedimenting mass.

https://openalex.org/W1538078526,"Abstract It has previously been shown that methylguanidine increases, by a factor of 7, the rate of the trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetylglycine ethyl ester, whereas n-butylguanidine inhibits the reaction. These effects have been postulated to be due to the binding of the effectors at the recognition site of the enzyme which results in an induced conformational change of the enzyme. In this study such induced effects were analyzed in terms of changes in chemical reactivity of functional groups in the active site of the enzyme. A comparison has been made of the effects of methylguanidine and n-butylguanidine with respect to the alkylation of histidyl residues by α-halo-acetic acid derivatives and with respect to the phosphorylation of the active seryl residue by diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The presence of methylguanidine increased the rate of the inactivation by iodoacetamide by a factor of 6 compared to the rate in the absence of the alkylguanidine, whereas n-butylguanidine decreased the rate. Data were obtained which suggested that the carboxamidomethylation of the 3-N atom of an imidazole of histidine caused such inactivation. The observed 7-fold increase in catalytic rate coupled with the concomitant 6-fold increase in the rate of alkylation strongly suggests that the binding of methylguanidine to the recognition site of the enzyme alters the reactivity of an imidazole group (groups). The phosphorylation reaction by diisopropyl fluorophosphate was completely prevented by both methyl- and n-butylguanidine. A generalized approach for studying the effects of conformational change of an enzyme molecule in terms of changes in the chemical reactivity of functional groups in the active site is proposed."
