https://openalex.org/W2021340905,"Th17 cells have critical roles in mucosal defense and are major contributors to inflammatory disease. Their differentiation requires the nuclear hormone receptor RORγt working with multiple other essential transcription factors (TFs). We have used an iterative systems approach, combining genome-wide TF occupancy, expression profiling of TF mutants, and expression time series to delineate the Th17 global transcriptional regulatory network. We find that cooperatively bound BATF and IRF4 contribute to initial chromatin accessibility and, with STAT3, initiate a transcriptional program that is then globally tuned by the lineage-specifying TF RORγt, which plays a focal deterministic role at key loci. Integration of multiple data sets allowed inference of an accurate predictive model that we computationally and experimentally validated, identifying multiple new Th17 regulators, including Fosl2, a key determinant of cellular plasticity. This interconnected network can be used to investigate new therapeutic approaches to manipulate Th17 functions in the setting of inflammatory disease."

https://openalex.org/W2129976097,"The niche is a conserved regulator of stem cell quiescence and function. During ageing, stem cell function declines. To what extent and by what means age-related changes within the niche contribute to this phenomenon are unknown. Here we demonstrate that the aged muscle stem cell niche, the muscle fibre, expresses Fgf2 under homeostatic conditions, driving a subset of satellite cells to break quiescence and lose their self-renewing capacity. We show in mice that relatively dormant aged satellite cells robustly express sprouty 1 (Spry1), an inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling. Increasing FGF signalling in aged satellite cells under homeostatic conditions by removing Spry1 results in the loss of quiescence, satellite cell depletion and diminished regenerative capacity. Conversely, reducing niche-derived FGF activity through inhibition of Fgfr1 signalling or overexpression of Spry1 in satellite cells prevents their depletion. These experiments identify an age-dependent change in the stem cell niche that directly influences stem cell quiescence and function."
https://openalex.org/W2039473152,"The genome-wide identification of pairs of interacting proteins is an important step in the elucidation of cell regulatory mechanisms. Much of our present knowledge derives from high-throughput techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid assay and affinity purification, as well as from manual curation of experiments on individual systems. A variety of computational approaches based, for example, on sequence homology, gene co-expression and phylogenetic profiles, have also been developed for the genome-wide inference of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Yet comparative studies suggest that the development of accurate and complete repertoires of PPIs is still in its early stages. Here we show that three-dimensional structural information can be used to predict PPIs with an accuracy and coverage that are superior to predictions based on non-structural evidence. Moreover, an algorithm, termed PrePPI, which combines structural information with other functional clues, is comparable in accuracy to high-throughput experiments, yielding over 30,000 high-confidence interactions for yeast and over 300,000 for human. Experimental tests of a number of predictions demonstrate the ability of the PrePPI algorithm to identify unexpected PPIs of considerable biological interest. The surprising effectiveness of three-dimensional structural information can be attributed to the use of homology models combined with the exploitation of both close and remote geometric relationships between proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2112538318,"FUS/TLS (fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma) and TDP-43 are integrally involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. We found that FUS/TLS binds to RNAs from >5,500 genes in mouse and human brain, primarily through a GUGGU-binding motif. We identified a sawtooth-like binding pattern, consistent with co-transcriptional deposition of FUS/TLS. Depletion of FUS/TLS from the adult nervous system altered the levels or splicing of >950 mRNAs, most of which are distinct from RNAs dependent on TDP-43. Abundance of only 45 RNAs was reduced after depletion of either TDP-43 or FUS/TLS from mouse brain, but among these were mRNAs that were transcribed from genes with exceptionally long introns and that encode proteins that are essential for neuronal integrity. Expression levels of a subset of these were lowered after TDP-43 or FUS/TLS depletion in stem cell-derived human neurons and in TDP-43 aggregate-containing motor neurons in sporadic ALS, supporting a common loss-of-function pathway as one component underlying motor neuron death from misregulation of TDP-43 or FUS/TLS."
https://openalex.org/W2140869639,"Inflammation and macrophage foam cells are characteristic features of atherosclerotic lesions, but the mechanisms linking cholesterol accumulation to inflammation and LXR-dependent response pathways are poorly understood. To investigate this relationship, we utilized lipidomic and transcriptomic methods to evaluate the effect of diet and LDL receptor genotype on macrophage foam cell formation within the peritoneal cavities of mice. Foam cell formation was associated with significant changes in hundreds of lipid species and unexpected suppression, rather than activation, of inflammatory gene expression. We provide evidence that regulated accumulation of desmosterol underlies many of the homeostatic responses, including activation of LXR target genes, inhibition of SREBP target genes, selective reprogramming of fatty acid metabolism, and suppression of inflammatory-response genes, observed in macrophage foam cells. These observations suggest that macrophage activation in atherosclerotic lesions results from extrinsic, proinflammatory signals generated within the artery wall that suppress homeostatic and anti-inflammatory functions of desmosterol."
https://openalex.org/W1994864933,"Successful pregnancy requires immune tolerance against paternal antigens expressed by the fetus; here pregnancy is shown to stimulate the selective accumulation of maternal immune-suppressive regulatory T cells with fetal specificity that are retained post-partum, which may explain the protective benefits of prior pregnancy against pre-eclampsia and other complications in subsequent pregnancy. Successful pregnancy requires the development of effective tolerance mechanisms for fetus antigens inherited from the father, which evoke an immune response because they are considered ‘non-self’ by the maternal immune system. Jared Rowe et al. show here that this is accomplished by the generation of maternal regulatory T cells with specificity for fetal antigens. Fetal-specific regulatory T cells re-accumulate with accelerated kinetics during secondary pregnancy and may explain why partner-specific secondary pregnancies show reduced rates of pre-eclampsia and other complications. Pregnancy is an intricately orchestrated process where immune effector cells with fetal specificity are selectively silenced. This requires the sustained expansion of immune-suppressive maternal FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells), because even transient partial ablation triggers fetal-specific effector T-cell activation and pregnancy loss1,2. In turn, many idiopathic pregnancy complications proposed to originate from disrupted fetal tolerance are associated with blunted maternal Treg expansion3,4,5. Importantly, however, the antigen specificity and cellular origin of maternal Treg cells that accumulate during gestation remain incompletely defined. Here we show that pregnancy selectively stimulates the accumulation of maternal FOXP3+ CD4 cells with fetal specificity using tetramer-based enrichment that allows the identification of rare endogenous T cells6. Interestingly, after delivery, fetal-specific Treg cells persist at elevated levels, maintain tolerance to pre-existing fetal antigen, and rapidly re-accumulate during subsequent pregnancy. The accelerated expansion of Treg cells during secondary pregnancy was driven almost exclusively by proliferation of fetal-specific FOXP3+ cells retained from prior pregnancy, whereas induced FOXP3 expression and proliferation of pre-existing FOXP3+ cells each contribute to Treg expansion during primary pregnancy. Furthermore, fetal resorption in secondary compared with primary pregnancy becomes more resilient to partial maternal FOXP3+ cell ablation. Thus, pregnancy imprints FOXP3+ CD4 cells that sustain protective regulatory memory to fetal antigen. We anticipate that these findings will spark further investigation on maternal regulatory T-cell specificity that unlocks new strategies for improving pregnancy outcomes and novel approaches for therapeutically exploiting Treg cell memory."
https://openalex.org/W2107314112,"DNA methylation and histone modification exert epigenetic control over gene expression. CHG methylation by CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) depends on histone H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), but the mechanism underlying this relationship is poorly understood. Here, we report multiple lines of evidence that CMT3 interacts with H3K9me2-containing nucleosomes. CMT3 genome locations nearly perfectly correlated with H3K9me2, and CMT3 stably associated with H3K9me2-containing nucleosomes. Crystal structures of maize CMT3 homolog ZMET2, in complex with H3K9me2 peptides, showed that ZMET2 binds H3K9me2 via both bromo adjacent homology (BAH) and chromo domains. The structures reveal an aromatic cage within both BAH and chromo domains as interaction interfaces that capture H3K9me2. Mutations that abolish either interaction disrupt CMT3 binding to nucleosomes and show a complete loss of CMT3 activity in vivo. Our study establishes dual recognition of H3K9me2 marks by BAH and chromo domains and reveals a distinct mechanism of interplay between DNA methylation and histone modification."
https://openalex.org/W2148070562,"In Drosophila, the fat body (FB), a functional analog of the vertebrate adipose tissue, is the nutrient sensor that conveys the nutrient status to the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in the fly brain to release Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps). Dilp secretion in turn regulates energy balance and promotes systemic growth. We identify Unpaired 2 (Upd2), a protein with similarities to type I cytokines, as a secreted factor produced by the FB in the fed state.

Upd2 is produced by the Drosophila fat body in response to dietary fats and sugars Dome activation by Upd2 in GABAergic neurons disinhibits insulin-producing cells This results in insulin secretion, promoting systemic growth and fat storage Human Leptin can signal via the Drosophila JAK/STAT receptor and substitute for Upd2 Integration of information regarding nutrient status with other physiological processes, such as systemic growth, energy expenditure, feeding, and reproduction, is a complex function performed by multicellular organisms. Disruption of this fundamental homeostatic process can lead to a number of disorders, in particular obesity, anorexia, and diabetes (Morton et al., 2006Morton G.J. Cummings D.E. Baskin D.G. Barsh G.S. Schwartz M.W. Central nervous system control of food intake and body weight.Nature. 2006; 443: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). In addition, it can have profound effects on cancer and aging (Hursting et al., 2003Hursting S.D. Lavigne J.A. Berrigan D. Perkins S.N. Barrett J.C. Calorie restriction, aging, and cancer prevention: mechanisms of action and applicability to humans.Annu. Rev. Med. 2003; 54: 131-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Insulin peptides are key hormones involved in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, tissue growth, and longevity (Taguchi and White, 2008Taguchi A. White M.F. Insulin-like signaling, nutrient homeostasis, and life span.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2008; 70: 191-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Circulating insulin absorbs nutrients such as glucose and lipids, and stores them for later use in the form of glycogen and triacylglycerol (TAG). When insulin production from pancreatic beta cells is disrupted in mammals, as in the case of Type I diabetes, the body is unable to utilize the nutrients consumed and instead mounts a starvation response whereby stored lipids and glycogen are broken down to generate energy (Kahn et al., 2005Kahn C.R. King G.L. Moses A.C. Weir G.C. Jacobson A.M. Smith R.J. Joslin’s Diabetes Mellitus.14th edition. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Boston2005Google Scholar). The production of insulin by pancreatic beta cells is tightly regulated to ensure that appropriate amounts are released into the blood depending on nutrient status and food intake. The insulin pathway is highly conserved from mammals to Drosophila and serves fundamentally the same physiological functions (Taguchi and White, 2008Taguchi A. White M.F.

Signaling and function of insulin-like peptides in insects.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2006; 51: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). A main difference, however, is that the fly insulin-producing cells (IPCs), which are homologous to pancreatic beta cells, are found in the brain (Rulifson et al., 2002Rulifson E.J. Kim S.K. Nusse R. Ablation of insulin-producing neurons in flies: growth and diabetic phenotypes.Science. 2002; 296: 1118-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). These IPCs lie in the brain median neurosecretory cluster (mNSC) and produce at least three of the eight known Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilp2, Dilp3, and Dilp5) (Brogiolo et al., 2001Brogiolo W. Stocker H. Ikeya T. Rintelen F. Fernandez R. Hafen E. An evolutionarily conserved function of the Drosophila insulin receptor and insulin-like peptides in growth control.Curr.

A deficiency that uncovers multiple Dilps (Dilp1–Dilp5) results in flies that, in addition to being smaller, have decreased TAG and increased circulating sugars (Kulkarni et al., 1997Kulkarni R.N. Wang Z.L. Wang R.M. Hurley J.D. Smith D.M. Ghatei M.A. Withers D.J. Gardiner J.V. Bailey C.J. Bloom S.R. Leptin rapidly suppresses insulin release from insulinoma cells, rat and human islets and, in vivo, in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2729-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Dilps secreted from the IPCs bind to the insulin receptor in peripheral tissues to promote growth and nutrient utilization. The fat body (FB) functions as a key sensor of the nutritional status of the fly and couples systemic growth, metabolism, and stem cell maintenance with nutritional availability. Studies using ex vivo organ cocultures of FBs and larval brains proposed that the FB secretes growth-promoting factors (Britton and Edgar, 1998Britton J.S.

Shearn A. In vitro growth of imaginal disks from Drosophila melanogaster.Science. 1977; 196: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Suppression of amino acid (AA) transport in the FB by knocking down the AA transporter slimfast (slif) resulted in flies with systemic growth defects, suggesting that the FB acts as a nutrient sensor that nonautonomously modulates insulin signaling based on nutrient status (Colombani et al., 2003Colombani J. Raisin S. Pantalacci S. Radimerski T. Montagne J. Léopold P. A nutrient sensor mechanism controls Drosophila growth.Cell. 2003; 114: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar; Géminard et al., 2009Géminard C. Rulifson E.J. Léopold P. Remote control of insulin secretion by fat cells in Drosophila.Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). When flies were cultured on rich food, the amount of Dilp accumulation was considerably lower in the IPCs compared with the level of Dilps in IPCs of nutrient-deprived flies. Consistent with this, the level of Dilps in the hemolymph of fed flies was higher than in starved flies (Géminard et al., 2009Géminard C. Rulifson E.J. Léopold P. Remote control of insulin secretion by fat cells in Drosophila.Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest that the regulation of organismal growth in response to nutrient availability involves the control of insulin secretion from brain IPCs by factors originating from the FB. Here, we identify Unpaired 2 (Upd2), a Drosophila cytokine, as a secreted factor produced by the FB in response to dietary fat and sugars. Upd2 activates Janus kinase (JAK)/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) signaling in GABAergic neurons, relieving their inhibitory effect on the IPCs and in turn resulting in the secretion of Dilps into the hemolymph to promote systemic growth and fat storage. The similarities between Upd2 and vertebrate Leptin are striking because Leptin is secreted from the adipose tissue in mammals under conditions of nutritional surplus, and high fat levels in particular (Zhang et al., 1994Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Positional cloning of the mouse obese gene and its human homologue.Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11741) Google Scholar). We show that human Leptin can functionally substitute for Drosophila Upd2 and can function as a ligand to the JAK/STAT receptor Dome Drosophila. Altogether, our studies illustrate how a cytokine-mediated pathway regulates the secretion of insulin to modulate systemic growth according to nutrient availability, in particular dietary fats, and provides evidence for the evolutionary conservation of this signaling module. Cytokines are secreted molecules that communicate intercellular signals and thus are ideal candidates for remotely signaling nutritional status (Dinarello and Mier, 1986Dinarello C.A. Mier J.W. Interleukins.Annu. Rev. Med. 1986; 37: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and signal through the JAK/STAT pathway. In the Drosophila genome, three related Upd ligands—Upd1, Upd, and Upd3—have predicted secondary structures similar to that of type I cytokines (Boulay et al., 2003Boulay J.L. O’Shea J.J. Paul W.E. Molecular phylogeny within type I cytokines and their cognate receptors.Immunity. 2003; 19: 159-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and regulate the activity of the JAK/STAT pathway (Wright et al., 2011Wright V.M. Vogt K.L. Smythe E. Zeidler M.P. Differential activities of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway ligands Upd, Upd2 and Upd3.Cell.

The roles of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2598-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). They bind to the transmembrane receptor Domeless (Dome) (Brown et al., 2001Brown S. Hu N. Hombría J.C. Identification of the first invertebrate interleukin JAK/STAT receptor, the Drosophila gene domeless.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1700-1705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which in turn activates the JAK Hopscotch (Hop) (Binari and Perrimon, 1994Binari R. Perrimon N. Stripe-specific regulation of pair-rule genes by hopscotch, a putative Jak family tyrosine kinase in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Activated Hop regulates STAT92E/Marelle (Hou et al., 1996Hou X.S. Melnick M.B. Perrimon N. Marelle acts downstream of the Drosophila HOP/JAK kinase and encodes a protein similar to the mammalian STATs.Cell. 1996; 84: 411-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Because cytokines play central roles in mammalian nutrition sensing and metabolic homeostasis, we reasoned that their fly counterparts could be involved in similar processes. To investigate the role of the Upd cytokines in the FB, and their effects on overall body size, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down their expression. At least two independent RNAi lines per gene and two different FB GAL4 drivers (ppl-GAL4; and cg-GAL4) were used to ensure that the knockdown was both gene and tissue specific. The efficiency of knockdown of all three genes in the larval FB was comparable (upd1, 80%; upd2, 60%; and upd3, 70%) as analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Of interest, only FB-specific knockdown of upd2, and not upd1 or upd3, resulted in smaller flies (Figures 1Aa and 1Ab ) and larvae (Figure 1Ac), suggesting that this ligand alone plays an FB-specific role in regulating systemic growth. In further support of the model that the effect of Upd2 on systemic growth is specific to the FB, knockdown of upd2 specifically in larval muscles did not affect body size (Figures S1A and S1B available online).Figure S1Upd2 Plays an FB-Specific Role in Regulating Systemic Growth and Metabolism, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) Adult female flies with FB-specific (A) and muscle-specific (B) knockdown of upd2.

Previously, an upd2 homozygous deletion mutant (upd2Δ) that removes the 5′UTR and the first 89 AAs was identified and reported to be viable and fertile (Hombría et al., 2005Hombría J.C. Brown S. Häder S. Zeidler M.P. Characterisation of Upd2, a Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway ligand.Dev. Biol. 2005; 288: 420-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). An examination of the growth phenotypes of upd2Δ flies, compared with an age- and population-density-matched control, showed that the upd2Δ flies were significantly slimmer and smaller (Figure 1B), similar to the phenotype generated with FB-specific knockdown of upd2Δ (Figure 1Ab). An examination of the wings, a tissue that can be easily quantified for growth phenotypes, revealed that upd2 mutant wings have a 10% reduction in overall size (Figure 1Ca) and a significant reduction in both cell number (Figure 1Cb) and cell size (Figure 1Cc). Expression of an upd2 cDNA in the FB of upd2Δ flies was able to rescue the wing size phenotype (Figure 1D), providing further evidence that upd2 plays an FB-specific role in the regulation of systemic growth. To test whether Upd2 plays a role in regulating energy metabolism, we measured the levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) in larvae with FB-specific knockdown of upd2. TAG levels were significantly reduced (Figure 1E). Similarly, upd2Δ larvae also showed a significant reduction in TAG levels (data not shown). Knockdown of upd2 specifically in other tissues, such as larval muscles, did not affect stored fat levels or body size (Figure S1), consistent with the model that the function of Upd2 is specific to the FB. In Drosophila, organismal growth is restricted to larval stages, and genetic manipulations that affect nutrient sensing during adulthood lead to metabolic phenotypes. To assay whether Upd2 plays a specific role in nutrient sensing in adults, we used a GAL4 driver that is expressed only in the adult FB (yolk-GAL4; see Experimental Procedures) and measured TAG levels in flies 15 days after eclosion. FB-specific knockdown of upd2 (Figure 1G) was associated with an increase in the amount of circulating sugar in the hemolymph, suggesting that Upd2 plays a role in the FB to regulate overall energy metabolism. Consistently, upd2Δ adults displayed an increase in the levels of circulating sugars (Figure 1H), and a significant reduction in TAG levels (Figure 1I) that could be rescued by expressing an upd2-cDNA in the FB (Figure 1J). Of interest, knockdown of stat92E, the transcription factor that mediates JAK/STAT pathway activity, in the FB (efficiency of knockdown in the FB as assayed by qPCR > 90%) did not affect TAG storage (Figure 1F), indicating that Upd2 plays a nonautonomous role in regulating fat storage. Altogether, these results indicate that Upd2 in the FB regulates systemic growth in larvae and energy metabolism in both larvae and adults. Further, the effect of Upd2 is likely FB nonautonomous, as removal of stat92E from the FB is not associated with an effect on systemic growth. To explore the relationship between Upd2 expression in the FB and the nutritional state, we examined upd2 transcript levels under starvation. Strikingly, we found that upd2 transcripts showed a 98% reduction (Figure 2A) in adult wild-type males that were starved on 1% sucrose agar for >72 hr. Because a reduction in size and energy metabolism could result from reduced nutritional intake, we measured fly feeding using both blue dye (Xu et al., 2008Xu K. Zheng X. Sehgal A. Regulation of feeding and metabolism by neuronal and peripheral clocks in Drosophila.Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and capillary feeder (CAFÉ) assays (Ja et al., 2007Ja W.W. Carvalho G.B. Mak E.M. de la Rosa N.N. Fang A.Y. Liong J.C. Brummel T. Benzer S. Prandiology of Drosophila and the CAFE assay.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 8253-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Both tests, performed in three to five replicates on age- and population-density-matched adult male flies, showed that neither the FB-specific knockdown of upd2 nor the upd2Δ flies had feeding-behavior defects (Figures 2B and 2C). To assess whether upd2 senses the nutritional state of the organism, we analyzed lipid storage in hepatocyte-like cells/oenocytes that accumulate lipid droplets only under conditions of nutritional deprivation and not under a fed state (Gutierrez et al., 2007Gutierrez E. Wiggins D. Fielding B. Gould A.P. Specialized hepatocyte-like cells regulate Drosophila lipid metabolism.Nature. 2007; 445: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Whereas the control larvae did not accumulate lipid droplets under fed conditions (Figure 2D), upd2Δ larvae showed a striking accumulation of lipid droplets in oenocytes, as assayed by Oil Red O staining, even under conditions of nutritional surplus (Figure 2D). Because upd2Δ flies feed normally, this lipid accumulation suggests that Upd2 is required to sense the appropriate nutritional state. Given that knocking down the AA transporter slif mimics the starvation state (Colombani et al., 2003Colombani J. Raisin S. Pantalacci S. Radimerski T. Montagne J. Léopold P. A nutrient sensor mechanism controls Drosophila growth.Cell. 2003; 114: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar; Gutierrez et al., 2007Gutierrez E. Wiggins D. Fielding B. Gould A.P. Specialized hepatocyte-like cells regulate Drosophila lipid metabolism.Nature. 2007; 445: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), we examined the upd2 steady-state mRNA levels in FB-specific slif knockdown (ppl-GAL4 > UAS-slifanti) by qPCR. Strikingly, the upd2 level increased by >2-fold, whereas another JAK/STAT ligand, upd1, and the downstream component STAT92E were not significantly altered (Figure 2E). Slif plays a role in transporting AAs, and its absence results in a protein-deprived state. Hence, the upregulation of upd2 under this state (Figure 2E) suggests that the upstream signal for upd2 expression is not nutrition-derived proteins. We next assayed upd2 expression in adult male flies subjected to diets rich in protein, fat, or sugar, and compared upd2 mRNA levels under these conditions with respect to standard lab food. In many independent experiments, we consistently found that 5 days after exposure to high-fat and high-sugar diets, the normalized steady-state level of upd2 mRNAs went up by 4- to 6-fold, a statistically significant difference compared with levels obtained on standard lab food (Figure 2F). Taken together, these results strongly argue that upd2 senses the fed state downstream of fats and sugars. To address whether Upd2 is sufficient to signal the fed state, we tested whether overexpression of upd2 in wild-type flies can suppress the starvation response associated with nutrient deprivation. We measured the breakdown of stored fat in starved flies overexpressing upd2 in the FB using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). TLC was performed on adult flies to measure the fat stores after a period of 24 hr on 1% agar. Whereas in control flies the stored fat levels were nearly depleted after 24 hr (Figure 2G; 98% reduction), the reduction was not significant in flies overexpressing upd2 in their FB (Figure 2G; 35% reduction). Thus, Upd2 can suppress stored fat breakdown under conditions of starvation, indicating that it signals a fed condition even when flies are deprived of nutrients. Brain IPCs secrete Dilps in response to nutrition and accumulate Dilps under conditions of nutrient deprivation (Géminard et al., 2009Géminard C. Rulifson E.J. Léopold P.

To test whether Upd2 overexpression in the FB can suppress accumulation of Dilps in the IPCs under conditions of starvation, age- and population-density-matched adult flies overexpressing Upd2 in the FB were starved for 24 hr on 1% agar. We then dissected and stained the brains for Dilp2 and Dilp5, analyzed them by confocal microscopy, and calculated the mean Dilp fluorescence. Strikingly, Dilp2 and Dilp5 accumulation was significantly lower in brains of starved flies overexpressing Upd2 in their FB (Figure 2H, 78% less Dilp2; data not shown for Dilp5), revealing that Upd2 expression in the FB alters Dilp2 and Dilp5 accumulation in brain IPCs in response to the nutritional state. Note that in the experiments described below, the same results were observed for both Dilp2 and Dilp5. For simplicity, only the Dilp2 data are shown, and in the text Dilp2 and Dilp5 are referred to as Dilp(s). The upd2Δ mutants and FB knockdown of upd2 resemble the dilp1–dilp5 deletion flies with respect to their size and metabolic phenotypes. Hence, we tested whether the primary role of Upd2 is to signal the fed state to the IPCs. Two different FB-specific drivers, cg-GAL4 (Figure 3A) and ppl-GAL4 (data not shown), were used for these experiments. RNAi against upd2 in the FB resulted in a statistically significant increase in mean Dilp fluorescence in larval brains (Figure 3A). This increase in Dilp accumulation was most apparent when the larvae were actively feeding. We performed a qPCR analysis of Dilp in the brains of larvae with FB-specific knockdown of upd2 RNAi to ensure that the increase in mean Dilp fluorescence was not a result of increased transcription. No significant change in Dilp transcription was observed (Figure S2). In addition, FB-specific knockdown of either stat92E or upd1 did not result in increased accumulation of Dilp (Figure 3A), which is consistent with our observations regarding body size and metabolism (Figure 1). Further, the increase in Dilp accumulation in the IPCs was also observed in both larval (data not shown) and adult upd2Δ homozygous mutant brains (Figure 3B). Finally, the accumulation of Dilp in the IPCs of upd2Δ homozygous mutants could be rescued by expressing upd2 cDNA in the FB (Figure 3Bc), indicating that the inability to release Dilps underlies both the systemic growth and energy metabolism phenotypes of upd2Δ mutants.Figure S2Dilp2 mRNA Levels in the Brain Are Not Significantly Altered in Flies with FB-Specific upd2 RNAi, Related to Figure 3Show full captionTotal RNA was extracted from brains of male larvae (see Extended Experimental Procedures), and the expression of Dilp2 was analyzed by qPCR.

The level of Dilp2 mRNA in the brain is not significantly altered when upd2 is knocked down in the FB. The p values were calculated using Welch’s t test. Error bars indicate the SD. IPCs in the Drosophila brain use membrane voltage-dependent neurosecretory mechanisms to facilitate Dilp release in response to nutrition (Géminard et al., 2009Géminard C. Rulifson E.J. Léopold P. Remote control of insulin secretion by fat cells in Drosophila.Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Thus, if Upd2 promotes Dilp secretion under fed conditions, activating Dilp secretion in upd2Δ homozygous mutants should rescue the upd2Δ growth phenotype. To achieve this, we depolarized the IPCs by expressing the bacterial sodium channel (NaChBac) (Luan et al., 2006Luan H. Lemon W.C. Peabody N.C. Pohl J.B. Zelensky P.K. Wang D. Nitabach M.N.

Under these conditions, the level of Dilp accumulation in the IPCs of upd2Δ was significantly reduced (Figure 3C). In addition, this artificial depolarization of the IPCs in an upd2Δ homozygous mutant background rescued the small size of upd2Δ mutants (Figure 3D). Of interest, hyperpolarizing the neurons by expressing the potassium channel rectifier EKO (White et al., 2001White B.H. Osterwalder T.P. Yoon K.S. Joiner W.J. Whim M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Keshishian H. Targeted attenuation of electrical activity in Drosophila using a genetically modified K(+) channel.Neuron. 2001; 31: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) did not exacerbate the upd2Δ size phenotype (Figure 3D), indicating that in the absence of upd2, the IPC neurons are already depolarized. In summary, the reduction in TAG levels, increase in circulating sugars, and systemic reduction in body size in the absence of upd2 resemble a reduction in insulin signaling, suggesting that the primary role of Upd2 is to remotely control the secretion of Dilps from the IPCs in response to nutrient intake. To elucidate how Upd2 regulates Dilp secretion in response to nutrition, we examined the activity of a STAT reporter (10XSTAT::GFP; see Experimental Procedures) that was previously shown to recapitulate JAK/STAT pathway activation (Bach et al., 2007Bach E.A. Ekas L.A. Ayala-Camargo A. Flaherty M.S. Lee H. Perrimon N. Baeg G.H. GFP reporters detect the activation of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway in vivo.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) in the adult brain. We found that STAT::GFP is widely expressed throughout the adult brain in both neurons and glia (Figure S3), and more specifically, it is expressed in the olfactory lobe (Figure 4A, asterisk), the optic lobe (Figure 4A, hash), and the mNSCs (a region that includes the IPCs plus other neurons; see arrow in Figure 4A) of the adult brain. Of importance, an analysis of single optical sections revealed that the STAT reporter is expressed in neurons juxtaposed to the IPCs (arrow, Figure 4B) in the mNSC region of the adult brain and in the larval brain (Figure S4).Figure 4STAT Reporter Expression in the Adult Brain and its Response to StarvationShow full caption(A) Anterior (subpanel a) and posterior (subpanel b) MIPs of adult male brains expressing the 10XSTAT::GFP reporter. nc82 (magenta), a presynaptic active-zone protein marker, identifies the neuropils.

https://openalex.org/W1973750557,"Regulatory T (Treg) cells, whose identity and function are defined by the transcription factor Foxp3, are indispensable for immune homeostasis. It is unclear whether Foxp3 exerts its Treg lineage specification function through active modification of the chromatin landscape and establishment of new enhancers or by exploiting a pre-existing enhancer landscape. Analysis of the chromatin accessibility of Foxp3-bound enhancers in Treg and Foxp3-negative T cells showed that Foxp3 was bound overwhelmingly to preaccessible enhancers occupied by its cofactors in precursor cells or a structurally related predecessor. Furthermore, the bulk of Foxp3-bound Treg cell enhancers lacking in Foxp3(-) CD4(+) cells became accessible upon T cell receptor activation prior to Foxp3 expression, and only a small subset associated with several functionally important genes were exclusively Treg cell specific. Thus, in a late cellular differentiation process, Foxp3 defines Treg cell functionality in an ""opportunistic"" manner by largely exploiting the preformed enhancer network instead of establishing a new enhancer landscape."

The associated posttranslational modifications regulate essential chromatin-dependent processes, yet whether each histone copy is identically modified in vivo is unclear. We demonstrate that nucleosomes in embryonic stem cells, fibroblasts, and cancer cells exist in both symmetrically and asymmetrically modified populations for histone H3 lysine 27 di/trimethylation (H3K27me2/3) and H4K20me1. Further, we obtained direct physical evidence for bivalent nucleosomes carrying H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 along with H3K27me3, albeit on opposite H3 tails. Bivalency at target genes was resolved upon differentiation of ES cells. Polycomb repressive complex 2-mediated methylation of H3K27 was inhibited when nucleosomes contain symmetrically, but not asymmetrically, placed H3K4me3 or H3K36me3. These findings uncover a potential mechanism for the incorporation of bivalent features into nucleosomes and demonstrate how asymmetry might set the stage to diversify functional nucleosome states."

TMEM16F of the TMEM16 family that includes TMEM16A/B Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs) is linked to Scott syndrome with deficient Ca(2+)-dependent lipid scrambling. We generated TMEM16F knockout mice that exhibit bleeding defects and protection in an arterial thrombosis model associated with platelet deficiency in Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatidylserine exposure and procoagulant activity and lack a Ca(2+)-activated cation current in the platelet precursor megakaryocytes. Heterologous expression of TMEM16F generates a small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated nonselective cation (SCAN) current with subpicosiemens single-channel conductance rather than a CaCC. TMEM16F-SCAN channels permeate both monovalent and divalent cations, including Ca(2+), and exhibit synergistic gating by Ca(2+) and voltage. We further pinpointed a residue in the putative pore region important for the cation versus anion selectivity of TMEM16F-SCAN and TMEM16A-CaCC channels. This study thus identifies a Ca(2+)-activated channel permeable to Ca(2+) and critical for Ca(2+)-dependent scramblase activity during blood coagulation. PAPERFLICK:"

They determine the phylogenetic structure of invasive Salmonella Typhimurium in sub-Saharan Africa and find that the majority are from two closely related highly conserved lineages, which emerged in the last 60 years in close temporal association with the current HIV epidemic. A highly invasive form of non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease has recently been documented in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The most common Salmonella enterica serovar causing this disease is Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium). We applied whole-genome sequence–based phylogenetic methods to define the population structure of sub-Saharan African invasive Salmonella Typhimurium isolates and compared these to global Salmonella Typhimurium populations. Notably, the vast majority of sub-Saharan invasive Salmonella Typhimurium isolates fell within two closely related, highly clustered phylogenetic lineages that we estimate emerged independently ∼52 and ∼35 years ago in close temporal association with the current HIV pandemic. Clonal replacement of isolates from lineage I by those from lineage II was potentially influenced by the use of chloramphenicol for the treatment of iNTS disease. Our analysis suggests that iNTS disease is in part an epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa caused by highly related Salmonella Typhimurium lineages that may have occupied new niches associated with a compromised human population and antibiotic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2143920361,"Integrins in focal adhesions (FAs) mediate adhesion and force transmission to extracellular matrices essential for cell motility, proliferation and differentiation. Different fibronectin-binding integrins, simultaneously present in FAs, perform distinct functions. Yet, how integrin dynamics control biochemical and biomechanical processes in FAs is still elusive. Using single-protein tracking and super-resolution imaging we revealed the dynamic nano-organizations of integrins and talin inside FAs. Integrins reside in FAs through free-diffusion and immobilization cycles. Integrin activation promotes immobilization, stabilized in FAs by simultaneous connection to fibronectin and actin-binding proteins. Talin is recruited in FAs directly from the cytosol without membrane free-diffusion, restricting integrin immobilization to FAs. Immobilized β3-integrins are enriched and stationary within FAs, whereas immobilized β1-integrins are less enriched and exhibit rearward movements. Talin is enriched and mainly stationary, but also exhibited rearward movements in FAs, consistent with stable connections with both β-integrins. Thus, differential transmission of actin motion to fibronectin occurs through specific integrins within FAs."

The defective ERK signaling was caused by the dual specific phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), whose protein expression increased with age due to a decline in repression by miR-181a. Reconstitution of miR-181a lowered DUSP6 expression in naive CD4(+) T cells in elderly individuals. DUSP6 repression using miR-181a or specific siRNA and DUSP6 inhibition by the allosteric inhibitor (E)-2-benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one improved CD4(+) T cell responses, as seen by increased expression of activation markers, improved proliferation and supported preferential T helper type 1 cell differentiation.

Additionally, it potently controlled the expression of multiple proinflammatory genes involved in the development of insulin resistance. Mice with a null mutation for TRPV4 or wild-type mice treated with a TRPV4 antagonist showed elevated thermogenesis in adipose tissues and were protected from diet-induced obesity, adipose inflammation, and insulin resistance.

These ubiquitylated cargoes are recognized by specific autophagy receptors, which recruit LC3-positive membranes to form autophagosomes. Subsequently, autophagosomes fuse with endosomes and lysosomes, thus facilitating degradation of their content; however, the machinery that targets and mediates fusion of these organelles with autophagosomes remains to be established. Here we demonstrate that myosin VI, in concert with its adaptor proteins NDP52, optineurin, T6BP and Tom1, plays a crucial role in autophagy. We identify Tom1 as a myosin VI binding partner on endosomes, and demonstrate that loss of myosin VI and Tom1 reduces autophagosomal delivery of endocytic cargo and causes a block in autophagosome–lysosome fusion. We propose that myosin VI delivers endosomal membranes containing Tom1 to autophagosomes by docking to NDP52, T6BP and optineurin, thereby promoting autophagosome maturation and thus driving fusion with lysosomes. Tumbarello, Buss and colleagues report that the motor protein myosin VI has an important role in autophagosome maturation. They show that myosin VI binds to autophagy adaptors to mediate delivery of endocytic cargo and endosomal membrane to autophagosomes, and promote autophagosome–lysosome fusion."

SKI encodes a known repressor of TGF-β activity, and this work provides evidence for paradoxical increased TGF-β signaling as the mechanism underlying these related syndromes. Elevated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of syndromic presentations of aortic aneurysm, including Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS)1,2,3,4. However, the location and character of many of the causal mutations in LDS intuitively imply diminished TGF-β signaling5. Taken together, these data have engendered controversy regarding the specific role of TGF-β in disease pathogenesis. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) has considerable phenotypic overlap with MFS and LDS, including aortic aneurysm6,7,8. We identified causative variation in ten individuals with SGS in the proto-oncogene SKI, a known repressor of TGF-β activity9,10. Cultured dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals showed enhanced activation of TGF-β signaling cascades and higher expression of TGF-β–responsive genes relative to control cells. Morpholino-induced silencing of SKI paralogs in zebrafish recapitulated abnormalities seen in humans with SGS. These data support the conclusions that increased TGF-β signaling is the mechanism underlying SGS and that high signaling contributes to multiple syndromic presentations of aortic aneurysm."

The crystal structure of the DnaB hexamer in complex with GDP-AlF4 and ssDNA reported here reveals that DnaB adopts a closed spiral staircase quaternary structure around an A-form ssDNA with each C-terminal domain coordinating two nucleotides of ssDNA. The structure not only provides structural insights into the translocation mechanism of superfamily IV helicases but also suggests that members of this superfamily employ a translocation mechanism that is distinct from other helicase superfamilies. We propose a hand-over-hand mechanism in which sequential hydrolysis of NTP causes a sequential 5′ to 3′ movement of the subunits along the helical axis of the staircase, resulting in the unwinding of two nucleotides per subunit."

Most of these elite controllers express the histocompatibility alleles HLA-B*57 or HLA-B*27 (ref. 3). These alleles remain by far the most robust associations with low concentrations of plasma virus, yet the mechanism of control in these individuals is not entirely clear. Here we vaccinate Indian rhesus macaques that express Mamu-B*08, an animal model for HLA-B*27-mediated elite control, with three Mamu-B*08-restricted CD8(+) T-cell epitopes, and demonstrate that these vaccinated animals control replication of the highly pathogenic clonal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mac239 virus. High frequencies of CD8(+) T cells against these Vif and Nef epitopes in the blood, lymph nodes and colon were associated with viral control. Moreover, the frequency of the CD8(+) T-cell response against the Nef RL10 epitope (Nef amino acids 137-146) correlated significantly with reduced acute phase viraemia. Finally, two of the eight vaccinees lost control of viral replication in the chronic phase, concomitant with escape in all three targeted epitopes, further implicating these three CD8(+) T-cell responses in the control of viral replication. Our findings indicate that narrowly targeted vaccine-induced virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses can control replication of the AIDS virus."

The portfolio entity can finance its activities by issuing debt, a critical advantage because a much larger pool of capital is available for investment in debt versus equity.

Previously, we showed that the cysteine protease cathepsin B (CatB) degrades Aβ, most likely by C-terminal truncation, in mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein with familial AD-linked mutations (hAPP(FAD)). In addition, the Aβ-degrading activity of CatB is inhibited by its endogenous inhibitor, cystatin C (CysC). Reducing CysC expression markedly lowers Aβ levels by enhancing CatB-mediated Aβ degradation in hAPP(FAD) mice. However, because a vast majority of AD patients do not carry familial mutations, we investigated how the CysC-CatB axis affects Aβ levels in mice expressing wild-type hAPP (hAPP(WT)). Enhancing CatB activity by CysC deletion significantly lowered total Aβ and Aβ42 levels in hAPP(WT) mice, whereas CatB deletion increased Aβ levels. To determine whether neuron-derived CatB degrades Aβ in vivo, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing CatB under the control of a neuron-specific enolase promoter. Enhancing neuronal CatB activity in hAPP(WT) mice significantly lowered Aβ42 levels. The processing of hAPP(WT) was unaffected by increasing or ablating CatB activity. Thus, the CysC-CatB axis affects degradation of Aβ42 derived from hAPP lacking familial mutations. These findings support the notion that enhancing CatB activity could lower Aβ, especially Aβ42, in AD patients with or without familial mutations."

Cells lacking CHMP1A show decreased cell proliferation and decreased expression of BMI1, a negative regulator of stem cell proliferation. Charged multivesicular body protein 1A (CHMP1A; also known as chromatin-modifying protein 1A) is a member of the ESCRT-III (endosomal sorting complex required for transport-III) complex1,2 but is also suggested to localize to the nuclear matrix and regulate chromatin structure3. Here, we show that loss-of-function mutations in human CHMP1A cause reduced cerebellar size (pontocerebellar hypoplasia) and reduced cerebral cortical size (microcephaly). CHMP1A-mutant cells show impaired proliferation, with increased expression of INK4A, a negative regulator of stem cell proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation suggests loss of the normal INK4A repression by BMI in these cells. Morpholino-based knockdown of zebrafish chmp1a resulted in brain defects resembling those seen after bmi1a and bmi1b knockdown, which were partially rescued by INK4A ortholog knockdown, further supporting links between CHMP1A and BMI1-mediated regulation of INK4A.

However, previous studies have examined global alterations in randomly selected accumbens neurons regardless of their activation state during cocaine-induced behavior. We recently found that a minority of strongly activated Fos-expressing accumbens neurons are necessary for cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization, whereas the majority of accumbens neurons are less directly involved. We assessed synaptic alterations in these strongly activated accumbens neurons in Fos-GFP mice, which express a fusion protein of Fos and GFP in strongly activated neurons, and compared these alterations with those in surrounding non-activated neurons. Cocaine sensitization produced higher levels of 'silent synapses', which contained functional NMDA receptors and nonfunctional AMPA receptors only in GFP-positive neurons, 6–11 d after sensitization. Thus, distinct synaptic alterations are induced in the most strongly activated accumbens neurons that mediate psychomotor sensitization."

We reported previously that rats exposed to a low-protein diet in utero and postnatal catch-up growth (recuperated) develop metabolic dysfunction and have reduced life span. Here we explored the hypothesis that cardiac oxidative and nitrosative stress leading to DNA damage and accelerated cellular aging could contribute to these phenotypes. Recuperated animals had a low birth weight (P<0.001) but caught up in weight to controls during lactation. At weaning, recuperated cardiac tissue had increased (P<0.05) protein nitrotyrosination and DNA single-stranded breaks. This condition was preceded by increased expression of DNA damage repair molecules 8-oxoguanine-DNA-glycosylase-1, nei-endonuclease-VIII-like, X-ray-repair-complementing-defective-repair-1, and Nthl endonuclease III-like-1 on d 3. These differences were maintained on d 22 and became more pronounced in the case of 8-oxoguanine-DNA-glycosylase-1 and nei-endonuclease-VIII-like. This was accompanied by increases in xanthine oxidase (P<0.001) and NADPH oxidase (P<0.05), major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The detrimental effects of increased ROS in recuperated offspring may be exaggerated at 22 d by reductions (P<0.001) in the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxin-3 and CuZn-superoxide-dismutase. We conclude that poor fetal nutrition followed by accelerated postnatal growth results in increased cardiac nitrosative and oxidative-stress and DNA damage, which could contribute to age-associated disease risk."

Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that regulates energy homeostasis. Leptin treatment strikingly ameliorates metabolic disorders of lipodystrophy, which exhibits ectopic fat accumulation and severe insulin-resistant diabetes due to a paucity of adipose tissue. Although leptin is shown to activate 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the skeletal muscle, the effect of leptin in the liver is still unclear. We investigated the effect of leptin on hepatic AMPK and its pathophysiological relevance in A-ZIP/F-1 mice, a model of generalized lipodystrophy. Here, we demonstrated that leptin activates hepatic AMPK through the central nervous system and α-adrenergic sympathetic nerves. AMPK activities were decreased in the fatty liver of A-ZIP/F-1 mice, and leptin administration increased AMPK activities in the liver as well as in skeletal muscle with significant reduction in triglyceride content. Activation of hepatic AMPK with A769662 also led to a decrease in hepatic triglyceride content and blood glucose levels in A-ZIP/F-1 mice. These results indicate that the down-regulation of hepatic AMPK activities plays a pathophysiological role in the metabolic disturbances of lipodystrophy, and the hepatic AMPK activation is involved in the therapeutic effects of leptin."

The aim of this study was to test whether inhibition of HDACs induces myocardial repair and cardiac function restoration through c-kit signaling in mouse myocardial infarction models. Myocardial infarction in wild type Kit(+/+) and Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice was created following thoracotomy by applying permanent ligation to the left anterior descending artery. The HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA, 0.1 mg/kg), was intraperitoneally injected daily for a consecutive 8 weeks after myocardial infarction. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally delivered every other day to pulse-chase label in vivo endogenous cardiac replication. Eight weeks later, inhibition of HDACs in vivo resulted in an improvement in ventricular functional recovery and the prevention of myocardial remodeling in Kit(+/+) mice, which was eliminated in Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice. HDAC inhibition promoted cardiac repairs and neovascularization in the infarcted myocardium, which were absent in Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice. Re-introduction of TSA-treated wild type c-kit(+) CSCs into Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) myocardial infarction heart restored myocardial functional improvement and cardiac repair. To further validate that HDAC inhibition stimulates c-kit(+) cardiac stem cells (CSCs) to facilitate myocardial repair, GFP(+) c-kit(+) CSCs were preconditioned with TSA (50 nmol/liter) for 24 h and re-introduced into infarcted hearts for 2 weeks. Preconditioning of c-kit(+) CSCs via HDAC inhibition with trichostatin A significantly increased c-kit(+) CSC-derived myocytes and microvessels and enhanced functional recovery in myocardial infarction hearts in vivo. Our results provide evidence that HDAC inhibition promotes myocardial repair and prevents cardiac remodeling, which is dependent upon c-kit signaling."

Sequence analysis revealed that OCT4A contains five putative ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites. Consistent with the hypothesis that OCT4A is a putative ERK1/2 substrate, we demonstrate that OCT4A interacts with ERK1/2 by using both in vitro GST pulldown and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays. MS analysis identified phosphorylation of OCT4A at Ser-111. To investigate the possibility that ERK1/2 activation can enhance OCT4A degradation, we analyzed endogenous ubiquitination in cells transfected with FLAG-OCT4A alone or with constitutively active MEK1 (MEK1(CA)), and we observed that the extent of OCT4 ubiquitination was clearly increased when MEK1(CA) was coexpressed and that this increase was more evident after MG132 treatment. These results suggest an increase in OCT4A ubiquitination downstream of MEK1 activation, and this could account for the protein loss observed after FGF2 treatment and MEK1(CA) transfection. Understanding and controlling the mechanism by which stem cells balance self-renewal would substantially advance our knowledge of stem cells."

https://openalex.org/W2044435842,"Human gene-2 (H2) relaxin is currently in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of acute heart failure. It is a 53-amino acid insulin-like peptide comprising two chains and three disulfide bonds. It interacts with two of the relaxin family peptide (RXFP) receptors. Although its cognate receptor is RXFP1, it is also able to cross-react with RXFP2, the native receptor for a related peptide, insulin-like peptide 3. In order to understand the basis of this cross-reactivity, it is important to elucidate both binding and activation mechanisms of this peptide. The primary binding mechanism of this hormone has been extensively studied and well defined. H2 relaxin binds to the leucine-rich repeats of RXFP1 and RXFP2 using B-chain-specific residues. However, little is known about the secondary interaction that involves the A-chain of H2 relaxin and transmembrane exoloops of the receptors. We demonstrate here through extensive mutation of the A-chain that the secondary interaction between H2 relaxin and RXFP1 is not driven by any single amino acid, although residues Tyr-3, Leu-20, and Phe-23 appear to contribute. Interestingly, these same three residues are important drivers of the affinity and activity of H2 relaxin for RXFP2 with additional minor contributions from Lys-9, His-12, Lys-17, Arg-18, and Arg-22. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of secondary activation interaction of RXFP1 and RXFP2 by H2 relaxin, leading to a potent and RXFP1-selective analog, H2:A(4-24)(F23A), which was tested in vitro and in vivo and found to significantly inhibit collagen deposition similar to native H2 relaxin."
https://openalex.org/W2003077100,"The molecular mechanism underlying the characteristic high apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2b relative to SERCA1a and SERCA2a isoforms was studied. The C-terminal tail of SERCA2b consists of an 11th transmembrane helix (TM11) with an associated 11-amino acid luminal extension (LE). The effects of each of these parts and their interactions with the SERCA environment were examined by transient kinetic analysis of the partial reaction steps in the Ca2+ transport cycle in mutant and chimeric Ca2+-ATPase constructs. Manipulations to the LE of SERCA2b markedly increased the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from Ca2E1. Addition of the SERCA2b tail to SERCA1a slowed Ca2+ dissociation, but only when the luminal L7/8 loop of SERCA1 was simultaneously replaced with that of SERCA2, thus suggesting that the LE interacts with L7/8 in Ca2E1. The interaction of LE with L7/8 is also important for the low rate of the Ca2E1P → E2P conformational transition. These findings can be rationalized in terms of stabilization of the Ca2E1 and Ca2E1P forms by docking of the LE near L7/8. By contrast, low rates of E2P dephosphorylation and E2 → E1 transition in SERCA2b depend critically on TM11, particularly in a SERCA2 environment, but do not at all depend on the LE or L7/8. This indicates that interaction of TM11 with SERCA2-specific sequence element(s) elsewhere in the structure is critical in the Ca2+-free E2/E2P states. Collectively these properties ensure a higher Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2b relative to other SERCA isoforms, not only on the cytosolic side, but also on the luminal side.

Active removal of Ca2+ from the cytosol is a critical aspect of signal transduction pathways in animal cells, facilitating the rapid cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations required for a wide range of physiological functions such as muscle contraction, neuronal transmission, cellular motility, and cell growth. By coupling the hydrolysis of ATP with the transport of Ca2+ ions across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the Ca2+-ATPase of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SERCA) 3The abbreviations used are: SERCAsarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPaseLEthe 11-amino acid luminal extensionTM1–TM11the 11 transmembrane segments numbered from the NH2-terminal end of the proteinT1032*amino acid T1032 followed by STOP condon indicated as asterisk. is an important player in the control of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase the 11-amino acid luminal extension the 11 transmembrane segments numbered from the NH2-terminal end of the protein amino acid T1032 followed by STOP condon indicated as asterisk. The human genome contains three SERCA genes, ATP2A1, ATP2A2, and ATP2A3, encoding SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3 proteins, respectively. Through tissue-specific and developmentally regulated alternative splicing, each of the three genes gives rise to 2–6 splice variants with differing carboxyl termini. The SERCAs are thought to accomplish Ca2+ transport by a reaction cycle (Scheme 1) involving the sequential formation and decay of an aspartyl-phosphorylated intermediate, coupled to changes in the Ca2+ binding sites, altering between states that are either directed toward the cytosol, tightly occluded inside the protein, or directed toward the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. A change in affinity, being high toward the cytosolic side and low toward the luminal side, facilitates the unidirectional translocation of Ca2+ against a large Ca2+ gradient. Crystal structures of the SERCA1a isoform have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic N (“nucleotide binding”), P (“phosphorylation”), and A (“actuator”) domains undergo large rearrangements during the phosphoenzyme processing steps, which are transformed into both translational and rotational movements of transmembrane helices containing Ca2+ binding amino acid residues (1Toyoshima C.

Little is, however, known about the mechanisms by which the various parts of the SERCA2b tail exert a regulatory effect. Dode et al. (10Dode L. Andersen J.P. Leslie N. Dhitavat J. Vilsen B.

Biol.

The apparent affinity for Ca2+ activation of the overall reaction depends not only on the “true” Ca2+ affinity (i.e. the on and off rates of Ca2+ at the E1 sites), but in addition rate constants of the Ca2E1P → E2P and E2 → E1 conformational transitions that limit the overall rate of the cycle are critical determinants of the apparent Ca2+ affinity, as has been demonstrated both experimentally and in a series of computer simulations of the cycle (13Andersen J.P. Sørensen T.L. Povlsen K. Vilsen B. Importance of transmembrane segment M3 of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase for control of the gateway to the Ca2+ sites.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23312-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This raises the question whether TM11 and the LE affect the same or distinct partial reactions of the enzyme cycle, and which ones? This question was not addressed in the previous studies focusing on the functional regions of the SERCA2b tail in studies of the overall reaction and its Ca2+ dependence. Information about effects on the individual partial reactions by the various parts of the tail is crucial to the understanding of when in the cycle, and how, physical interaction takes place between the tail and the protein, and is thus a key point in the elucidation of the mechanism(s) underlying the regulatory effects exerted by the tail. Hence, in the present study we set out to investigate these matters in transient kinetic studies of the differential effects of the TM11 and LE on individual partial reactions of the enzyme cycle. On the one hand, we studied mutants with alterations to either the TM11 or LE, which were previously reported to display a loss of SERCA2b tail function with respect to the apparent Ca2+ affinity determined for the overall reaction (6Vandecaetsbeek I. Trekels M. De Maeyer M. Ceulemans H. Lescrinier E. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Vangheluwe P. Structural basis for the high Ca2+ affinity of the ubiquitous SERCA2b Ca2+ pump.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18533-18538Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we followed a gain of function approach by characterizing the kinetics of SERCA1a-2b chimeras in which the SERCA2b tail is gradually reconstructed in the SERCA1a background. Using this combined approach we show that the LE is the most important determinant of the dissociation of Ca2+ from the Ca2E1 form, whereas TM11 is of particular importance for the rates of the E2P → E2 and E2 → E1 partial reaction steps. A critical interaction of TM11 with SERCA2 specific component(s) appears to be involved in the E2/E2P states. The cDNA encoding the wild types or various SERCA constructs studied in the present work was either the same as in previous studies (6Vandecaetsbeek I. Trekels M. De Maeyer M. Ceulemans H.

To determine a time course of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, at least two independent series of kinetic experiments were carried out (see n values in TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3), with the earliest time points in duplicate in each series. Here independent means: carried out on different days, using enzyme preparations from different transfections. The complete set of data points collected (all shown in the graphs) was analyzed by nonlinear regression using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.), and the extracted parameters with the S.E. values from the regression are reported in the tables. Monoexponential functions were fitted to the time courses of dephosphorylation, Ca2+ binding, and Ca2+ dissociation. The analysis of the Ca2+-concentration dependence of phosphorylation was performed using the modified Hill equations given in the corresponding legends.TABLE 3Apparent affinities for cytoplasmic and luminal Ca2+Activation of phosphorylation from ATP by cytoplasmic Ca2+, K0.5Activation of phosphorylation from Pi by luminal Ca2+, K0.5μmaMicrosomes were pre-equilibrated at 0 °C in 40 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0), 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and various concentrations of CaCl2 to obtain a series of free Ca2+ concentrations in the 0.1–100 μm range, followed by phosphorylation for 15 s at 0 °C with 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP and subsequent acid quenching.

Open table in a new tab The wild types studied were the rabbit SERCA1a (“S1a”), human SERCA2a (“S2a”), and human SERCA2b (“S2b”). A group of loss of SERCA2b tail function mutants with alteration to the LE or TM11 of the SERCA2b tail were analyzed. “S2b-T1032*” is SERCA2b truncated just prior to Thr1032 by substituting the codon corresponding to Thr1032 with a STOP codon indicated by an asterisk (*), thereby deleting the entire 11-amino acid LE of the SERCA2b tail (Fig. 1 and Table 1). In “S2b-MFWS-AAAA,” the last four amino acid residues of the SERCA2b LE (1039MFWS) are replaced by alanines. A set of SERCA1a-2b chimeras were also studied, in which either the complete 49-amino acid C-terminal tail of SERCA2b was attached to SERCA1a (“S1a2b”), or only the part of the tail consisting of TM11 without the LE was attached to SERCA1a (“S1a2b-T1032*,” i.e. S1a2b truncated as described for S2b-T1032*). The effect of simultaneously replacing the luminal loop connecting transmembrane helices TM7 and TM8 (L7/8) with the corresponding loop of SERCA2a/SERCA2b was also examined (“S1a2b-L7/8” with “S1a-L7/8” as reference), because the large L7/8 loop contains several amino acid differences between SERCA1 and SERCA2 isoforms and is likely to be in contact with the LE (Fig. 1B). Ca2+ dissociation from Ca2E1, i.e. toward the cytosolic side, was examined in rapid kinetic measurements taking advantage of the requirement for occupancy of the two Ca2+ sites to allow phosphorylation from ATP. The mixing protocol is illustrated at the top of Fig. 2 (for a more detailed description of this method see Ref. 20Clausen J.D. Andersen J.P. Functional consequences of alterations to Thr-247, Pro-248, Glu-340, Asp-813, Arg-819, and Arg-822 at the interfaces between domain P, M3, and L6–7 of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase.

Upon addition of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA the ability to become phosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP disappears at a rate corresponding to the rate of Ca2+ dissociation (actually the rate corresponding to the Ca2+ ion dissociating first in the sequential mechanism, because both Ca2+ sites must be filled for phosphorylation to occur). The Ca2+ dissociation was markedly slower for SERCA2b than for SERCA1a (3.2-fold) or SERCA2a (5.5-fold). Much of this effect seems attributable to the LE of the tail, as the truncation of SERCA2b at Thr1032 led to a marked 3.4-fold increase of the rate of Ca2+ dissociation (Fig. 2 and Table 2, S2b-T1032*). A conspicuous increase in the Ca2+ dissociation rate (2.6-fold) was also obtained by the less extensive modification in which only the last four amino acid residues (1039MFWS) of the SERCA2b LE were replaced by alanines (Fig. 2 and Table 2, S2b-MFWS-AAAA), implying that these last four amino acids are critical for Ca2+ dissociation. TM11 may also be of some minor importance in determining the slow Ca2+ dissociation of SERCA2b, because the removal of TM11 resulted in a 1.6-fold increase of the Ca2+ dissociation rate (compare SERCA2a with S2b-T1032*).

Both p38 and c-Met promote the proliferation and invasion of human cholangiocarcinoma cells. Importantly, inhibition or knockdown of p38 decreased the basal activation of c-Met.

Moreover, density enhanced phosphatase-1 (DEP-1) is involved in p38-mediated inhibiting dephosphorylation of c-Met. Furthermore, p38 inhibits the degradation of c-Met.

In zebrafish myf5, a microRNA (miR), termed miR-3906 or miR-In300, was reported to silence dickkopf-3-related gene (dkk3r or dkk3a), resulting in repression of myf5 promoter activity. However, the membrane receptor that interacts with ligand Dkk3a to control myf5 expression through signal transduction remains unknown. To address this question, we applied immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS to screen putative membrane receptors of Dkk3a, and Integrin α6b (Itgα6b) was finally identified. To further confirm this, we used cell surface binding assays, which showed that Dkk3a and Itgα6b were co-expressed at the cell membrane of HEK-293T cells. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation data also showed high affinity of Itgα6b for Dkk3a. We further proved that the β-propeller repeat domains of Itgα6b are key segments bound by Dkk3a. Moreover, when dkk3a and itgα6b mRNAs were co-injected into embryos, luciferase activity was up-regulated 4-fold greater than that of control embryos. In contrast, the luciferase activities of dkk3a knockdown embryos co-injected with itgα6b mRNA and itgα6b knockdown embryos co-injected with dkk3a mRNA were decreased in a manner similar to that in control embryos, respectively. Knockdown of itgα6b resulted in abnormal somite shape, fewer somitic cells, weaker or absent myf5 expression, and reduced the protein level of phosphorylated p38a in somites. These defective phenotypes of trunk muscular development were similar to those of dkk3a knockdown embryos.

Thus, human Dkk3 provides a new strategy against some human malignant tumors. For example, the forced expression of REIC/Dkk3 inhibited cell growth in HeLa and liver cancer cell lines (17Kawasaki K.

Apart from the study of Dkk3 function in cell lines, dkk3 is reported to be expressed in many organs during mouse embryonic development, including neural epithelium, limb bud, bone, and heart, particularly in regions of epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (20Monaghan A.P. Kioschis P. Wu W. Zuniga A. Bock D. Poustka A. Delius H. Niehrs C. Dickkopf genes are co-ordinately expressed in mesodermal lineages.Mech. Dev. 1999; 87: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The dkk3 gene is also widely expressed in adult tissues with the highest levels found in the heart and brain (1Krupnik V.E. Sharp J.D. Jiang C. Robison K. Chickering T.W. Amaravadi L. Brown D.E. Guyot D. Mays G. Leiby K. Chang B. Duong T. Goodearl A.D. Gearing D.P. Sokol S.Y. McCarthy S.A. Functional and structural diversity of the human Dickkopf gene family.Gene. 1999; 238: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, two dkk3 genes, dkk3a/dkk3r (NCBI Reference Sequence NM_001159283.1) and dkk3b (NCBI Reference Sequence NM_001089545.1), have been reported (21Untergasser G. Martowicz A. Hermann M. Töchterle S. Meyer D. Distinct expression patterns of dickkopf genes during late embryonic development of Danio rerio.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2011; 11: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The dkk3a is strongly expressed in various neuronal structures of the head, whereas dkk3b is expressed mainly in the endocrine cells of the pancreas and brachial arches. Nevertheless, the function of Dkk3 during embryonic development is extremely limited. Myf5, a myogenic regulatory factor, plays important roles in the specification and differentiation of muscle cells during myogenesis. Recently, we found a novel microRNA, named miR-I300 (miR-3906), which binds to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA of dkk3a (22Hsu R.J. Lin C.Y. Hoi H.S. Zheng S.K. Lin C.C. Tsai H.J. Novel intronic microRNA represses zebrafish myf5 promoter activity through silencing dickkopf-3 gene.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Knockdown of dkk3a with dkk3a morpholino (MO) resulted in the down-regulation of myf5 expression, suggesting that Dkk3a is involved in the upstream positive regulation of myf5. Furthermore, Hsu et al. (23Hsu R.J. Lin C.C. Su Y.F. Tsai H.J. dickkopf-3-related gene regulates the expression of zebrafish myf5 gene through phosphorylated p38a-dependent Smad4 activity.J. Biol.

Stabilization of Smad4 enables formation of a Smad2/3a/4 complex, which then enters the nucleus to activate the myf5 promoter. Although β-transducin repeat-containing proteins (24Lee E.J. Jo M.

In this study, we found that Integrin α6b (Itgα6b) is a membrane receptor of secretory Dkk3a and that the interaction of Dkk3a and Itgα6b drives the downstream signal transduction to regulate myf5 promoter activity in somites during the development of zebrafish embryos. Full-length cDNAs of zebrafish dkk3a and itgα6b were cloned from embryos at 16 hours postfertilization (hpf) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The open reading frames (ORF) of dkk3a and itgα6b were inserted into pCS2+ to generate pCS2-dkk3a and pCS2-itgα6b, respectively. Plasmids pCS2-dkk3a-FLAG and pCS2-itgα6b-MYC were engineered by ligation of FLAG and MYC epitopes fused after the ORFs of dkk3a and itgα6b, respectively. The serial deletions of Itgα6b were obtained by PCR using pCS2-itgα6b as a template. The baculovirus recombinant transfer vectors pVL1392-dkk3a-FLAG, pVL1392-EGFP-FLAG, pVL1393-itgα6b-MYC, pVL1393-itgα6bΔ1-MYC, pVL1393-itgα6bΔ2-MYC, and pVL1393-itgα6bΔ3-MYC were constructed from the transfer vector pVL1393 (BD Biosciences) in which DNA fragments of dkk3a-FLAG, EGFP-FLAG, itgα6b-MYC, itgα6bΔ1-MYC, itgα6b-Δ2-MYC, and itgα6bΔ3-MYC were inserted, respectively. Plasmid pCMV-Itgα6b-EGFP was constructed by inserting itgα6b ORF into plasmid pCMV-EGFP (Clontech). Plasmid pCS2-itgα6b-MO-target-EGFP was constructed by inserting a target sequence for itgα6b MO, which is located at +52/+86 within the 5′-UTR of itgα6b mRNA, into pCS2-EGFP. Plasmid pCS2-NLS-EGFP was inserted as a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence into pCS2-EGFP. Plasmids pCS2-itgα6bΔ1 lacking five repeat domains, pCS2-itgα6bΔ2 lacking the first repeat domains, and pCS2-itgα6bΔ3 lacking the last four repeat domains were constructed to study the activity of binding domains and interaction between Itgα6b and Dkk3a. In the rescue experiment, we used PCR to mutate the target nucleotide sequences of dkk3a MO (ATGTTTCTGCTCGGATTCAGCCTC) and itgα6b MO (ATGGAATCTTACAGGACTTTAACC) into dkk3a(wobble) (ATGTTCCTCCTTGGGTTTAGTCTT) and itgα6b(wobble) (ATGGAGTCCTATAGAACCTTGACT), respectively, (the mutated nucleotides are underlined) without changing their amino acid sequences. The dkk3a(wobble) and itgα6b(wobble) were inserted into pCS2+ and pCS2+-FLAG to generate pCS2-dkk3a(wobble), pCS2-itgα6b(wobble), and pCS2-dkk3a(wobble)-FLAG. Plasmids pVL1392-dkk3a-FLAG, pVL1392-EGFP-FLAG, pVL1393-itgα6b-MYC, pVL1393-itgα6bΔ1-MYC, pVL1393-itgα6bΔ2-MYC, and pVL1393-itgα6bΔ3-MYC were used to express recombinant proteins in the insect cell line Sf21 using a baculovirus protein expression system according to procedures described in the BaculoGoldTM transfection kit (BD Biosciences). Recombinant baculovirus containing plasmids pVL1392-dkk3a-FLAG and pVL1392-EGFP-FLAG were individually transfected into Sf21 cells. The recombinant proteins Dkk3a-FLAG and EGFP-FLAG were purified by anti-FLAG beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation of Dkk3a-FLAG and EGFP-FLAG with extracts isolated from zebrafish embryos at 16 hpf followed the protocols described in the Pierce Crosslink Immunoprecipitation kit (Thermo). The resultant immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and in-gel digestion. The immunoprecipitates shown on SDS-PAGE were cut into many gel pieces about 1 mm in length, and they were used to perform in-gel digestion and LC-MS/MS according to procedures described by Chiang et al.

The resultant MGF file was searched using the Mascot search engine (v2.2, Matrix Science) with the following conditions. 1) The protein database was set as Swiss-Prot. 2) Taxonomy was set as Danio rerio (zebrafish). 3) One trypsin missed cleavage was allowed. 4) The peptide mass tolerance was set at ±0.5 Da, and the fragment mass tolerance was set at ±0.5 Da. 5) Carbamidomethyl (Cys) was chosen as a fixed modification. 6) Oxidation (Met) and deamidation (Asn and Gln) were chosen as variable modifications. The conditional media used to culture Sf21 cells infected by recombinant baculovirus containing pVL1392-dkk3a-FLAG to produce extracellular Dkk3a-FLAG were concentrated about 40-fold using Amicon Ultra (Millipore). The concentration of secreted Dkk3a-FLAG was determined by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antiserum. For cell surface binding experiments, HEK-293T cells were separately transfected with pCMV-itgα6b-EGFP and pCMV (served as control) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection for 48 h in a 6-well plate, cells were incubated with Dkk3a-FLAG proteins for 30 min at 4 °C. We discarded the conditional media, washed cells with PBS, and fixed them with 4% paraformaldehyde. Then cells were stained with anti-FLAG-Alexa Fluor 555 (Cell Signaling Technology) and observed under confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 780). The recombinant protein Dkk3a-FLAG in concentrated media and the insect cell line separately infected with Itgα6b-MYC, Itgα6bΔ1-MYC, Itgα6bΔ2-MYC, and Itgα6bΔ3-MYC were mixed with bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate to perform cross-linking immunoprecipitation according to the procedures described for bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate cross-linkers (Thermo). Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MYC beads (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were prepared for Western blot analysis. The synthesis of capped mRNAs, labeling of probes for WISH, observation of embryos under fluorescence microscopy, extraction of total proteins from embryos, Western blotting, and quantitative measurement of luciferase activity followed the methods described by Hsu et al. (23Hsu R.J. Lin C.C. Su Y.F. Tsai H.J. dickkopf-3-related gene regulates the expression of zebrafish myf5 gene through phosphorylated p38a-dependent Smad4 activity.J. Biol.

The antisense MOs designed specifically to knock down itgα6b (itgα6b MO) and dkk3a (dkk3a MO) were CGGTTAAAGTCCTGTAAGATTCCAT and GAGGCTGAATCCGAGCAGAAACATG, respectively. The itgα6b negative control MO (itgα6b control MO) and dkk3a negative control MO (dkk3a control MO) were designed as CGGTTAAAATCATGTAAAATTCAAT and GACGCTCAATCCGACCACAAAGATG, respectively (the mutated-mismatched nucleotides are underlined). All MOs were prepared at a stock concentration of 1 mm and diluted to the desired concentration for microinjection into each embryo. To search for the membrane receptor bound by the secreted Dkk3a, we first produced recombinant Dkk3a fused with the FLAG reporter using the baculovirus expression system in insect cells (Fig. 1), and the protein function of dkk3a was not altered by adding a FLAG reporter at the C terminus (supplemental Fig. S1). This recombinant Dkk3a-FLAG was immunoprecipitated with membrane proteins extracted from zebrafish embryos at 16 hpf. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with silver staining (Fig. 2). We further applied LC-MS/MS to reveal the putative proteins bound by Dkk3a-FLAG, including cell membrane proteins, mitochondrial proteins, endoplasmic reticulum proteins, and cytoskeleton proteins (Table 1). Among them, we focused on the membrane proteins and then screened them by an in vivo luciferase assay of myf5 promoter. Because Itgα6b was capable of up-regulating myf5 promoter activity (see Fig. 4), we proposed that Itgα6b might be a likely membrane receptor bound by Dkk3a. To further confirm this, we used a cell surface binding assay, which demonstrated that Dkk3a and Itgα6b were co-expressed at the cell membrane of HEK-293T cells (Fig. 3). Data from the cell surface cross-linking experiment combined with cross-linking immunoprecipitation also demonstrated the high affinity of Itgα6b for Dkk3a (see Fig. 5C). Based on this evidence, we suggested that Itgα6b is a high affinity Dkk3a receptor.FIGURE 2The protein profiles of Dkk3a-FLAG immunoprecipitated with zebrafish membrane proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2072186902,"The zinc-binding domain (ZBD) of prokaryotic DNA primases has been postulated to be crucial for recognition of specific sequences in the single-stranded DNA template. To determine the molecular basis for this role in recognition, we carried out homolog-scanning mutagenesis of the zinc-binding domain of DNA primase of bacteriophage T7 using a bacterial homolog from Geobacillus stearothermophilus. The ability of T7 DNA primase to catalyze template-directed oligoribonucleotide synthesis is eliminated by substitution of any five-amino acid residue-long segment within the ZBD. The most significant defect occurs upon substitution of a region (Pro-16 to Cys-20) spanning two cysteines that coordinate the zinc ion. The role of this region in primase function was further investigated by generating a protein library composed of multiple amino acid substitutions for Pro-16, Asp-18, and Asn-19 followed by genetic screening for functional proteins. Examination of proteins selected from the screening reveals no change in sequence-specific recognition. However, the more positively charged residues in the region facilitate DNA binding, leading to more efficient oligoribonucleotide synthesis on short templates. The results suggest that the zinc-binding mode alone is not responsible for sequence recognition, but rather its interaction with the RNA polymerase domain is critical for DNA binding and for sequence recognition. Consequently, any alteration in the ZBD that disturbs its conformation leads to loss of DNA-dependent oligoribonucleotide synthesis.

Consequently, any alteration in the ZBD that disturbs its conformation leads to loss of DNA-dependent oligoribonucleotide synthesis. A problem encountered by the replisome is the simultaneous replication of antiparallel DNA strands by the unidirectional polymerizing activity of DNA polymerases. This dilemma is resolved by different modes of DNA synthesis for the leading and lagging strands. Unlike the continuous synthesis of the leading strand, the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in the form of Okazaki fragments. The Okazaki fragments reside within a replication loop that allows for the overall synthesis of both strands in the same direction with all events occurring within the replisome. Synthesis of the Okazaki fragments however necessitates a supply of oligoribonucleotides on the single-stranded lagging strand extruded by the helicase during leading strand synthesis. DNA primases are designated to fulfill this function by catalyzing the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides (1Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. DNA primases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Unlike their eukaryotic counterparts, prokaryotic DNA primases (DnaG family) synthesize primers from specific sites on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). 2The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAZBDzinc-binding domainRPDRNA polymerase domain. Amino acid sequence alignment of DNA primases from bacteria and bacteriophages has identified six conserved motifs (2Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Organization and evolution of bacterial and bacteriophage primase-helicase systems.J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The first motif at the N terminus of the primase is a zinc-binding domain (ZBD) that consists of four cysteines (Cys4) or three cysteines and one histidine (Cys-His-Cys2) that coordinate a zinc ion. The other five motifs reside in an RNA polymerase domain (RPD) located in the C-terminal portion of the primase where binding and the catalytic condensation of NTPs occur. Motifs 4–6 form a TOPRIM-fold that contains two magnesium ions that participate in a two metal-mediated phosphodiester formation reaction similar to most polymerases (3Aravind L. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Toprim-a conserved catalytic domain in type IA and II topoisomerases, DnaG-type primases, OLD family nucleases, and RecR proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Together with the TOPRIM-fold, motifs 2 and 3 are believed to create the template-binding site. Although the RPD is responsible for the template-directed coupling of the NTPs, the ZBD plays a critical role in the binding of the primase to specific trinucleotide sequences in the template defined as primase recognition sites (1Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. DNA primases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Each prokaryotic primase has its own recognition sequence for primer synthesis, distinct from others. The “cryptic” nucleotide at the 3′-side of the trinucleotide is not copied into RNA products, but its presence is essential for recognition of the sequence by the primase. NTPs complementary to the next nucleotides at the 5′-side of the template are then added to generate the dinucleotide, and it is further extended to the oligonucleotide of a functional length that can be used by the DNA polymerase as a primer. Primers synthesized de novo must be stabilized by the primase and then handed off to DNA polymerase for the initiation of DNA synthesis. single-stranded DNA zinc-binding domain RNA polymerase domain. One of the well characterized prokaryotic primases is the primase-helicase encoded by gene 4 of bacteriophage T7. The C-terminal domain of the gene 4 protein is a member of superfamily 4 hexameric helicases. The helicase domain binds ssDNA and unwinds parental DNA at the expense of dTTP hydrolysis. The primase domain, located in the N-terminal half of the gene 4 protein, recognizes the sequence 5′-GTC-3′ in ssDNA. At this trinucleotide recognition site, the T7 DNA primase catalyzes the synthesis of the diribonucleotide pppAC and further extends it to functional tetraribonucleotides, and pppACCC, pppACCA, and pppACAC provided cognate sequences are available in the template (4Tabor S.

The crystal structure of the T7 primase revealed a modular organization in which the ZBD and the RPD are connected by a flexible linker (6Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T.

The ZBD of T7 primase contains a four-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 1). Four cysteines, located at loop regions connecting β-strands, coordinate a zinc ion to form a structure typical of members of the zinc-ribbon family. The RPD of T7 primase contains an N-terminal subdomain consisting of four β-strands (motifs 2 and 3) and the TOPRIM-fold (motifs 4–6). Substitution of conserved residues in these signature motifs results in loss of ability to catalyze phosphodiester bond formation and thus synthesis of oligoribonucleotides illustrating their critical roles in catalysis (7Lee S.J.

The flexible linker region connecting the ZBD and RPD modulates contacts between the two subdomains during primer synthesis (9Qimron U. Lee S.J. Hamdan S.M. Richardson C.C. Primer initiation and extension by T7 DNA primase.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Within the hexameric structure composed of full-length gene 4 primase-helicase, a ZBD from one subunit can interact with the RPD from the adjacent subunit to catalyze synthesis of oligoribonucleotides in a trans mode (10Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. Interaction of adjacent primase domains within the hexameric gene 4 helicase-primase of bacteriophage T7.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 12703-12708Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting a regulatory role of primase during DNA synthesis (11Lee J.B. Hite R.K. Hamdan S.M. Xie X.S. Richardson C.C. van Oijen A.M. DNA primase acts as a molecular brake in DNA replication.Nature. 2006; 439: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The importance of the ZBD in DNA-dependent oligoribonucleotide synthesis was initially noticed in studies with the 56-kDa gene 4 protein, a truncated form of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein, that arises from in-frame translation of the full-length gene 4 (12Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Complete nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage T7 DNA and the locations of T7 genetic elements.J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The 56-kDa gene 4 protein lacks the N-terminal 63 amino acid residues corresponding to the ZBD and is not capable of catalyzing primer synthesis in a template-dependent manner (13Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. A 7-kDa region of the bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein is required for primase but not for helicase activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the 56-kDa gene 4 protein, like the full-length protein, does synthesize random diribonucleotide in the absence of template, albeit at a very slow rate. Replacement of a single cysteine in the ZBD with a serine results in loss of the zinc ion and abolishes template-directed synthesis (14Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. Requirement for a zinc motif for template recognition by the bacteriophage T7 primase.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis has identified amino acid residues critical to the recognition of 5′-GTC-3′ (15Kusakabe T. Hine A.V. Hyberts S.G. Richardson C.C. The Cys-4 zinc finger of bacteriophage T7 primase in sequence-specific single-stranded DNA recognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 4295-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A persistent goal has been to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the T7 primase recognizes a trinucleotide sequence in ssDNA. Prokaryotic DNA primases, each having a distinct ZBD, synthesize primers of different sequences. Consequently, it has been suggested that sequence specificity is dictated by interactions between amino acid residues in the ZBD and the trinucleotide sequence in DNA (1Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. DNA primases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Previously, we attempted to modify the specificity by either swapping the entire ZBD (16Hine A.V. Richardson C.C. A functional chimeric DNA primase: the Cys-4 zinc-binding domain of bacteriophage T3 primase fused to the helicase of bacteriophage T7.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 12327-12331Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or a portion of the zinc-spanning region with equivalent parts of homologs (17Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. The role of the zinc motif in sequence recognition by DNA primases.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19563-19570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that the integrity of ZBD is important in the recognition of specific sequences, but they failed to reveal the basis for the recognition. Recent reports of the structures and recognition sequences of DNA primases have provided an approach to obtain additional information on the role of the ZBD in template recognition and binding (18Koepsell S.A. Larson M.A. Griep M.A. Hinrichs S.H. Staphylococcus aureus helicase but not Escherichia coli helicase stimulates S. aureus primase activity and maintains initiation specificity.J.

Class-specific restrictions define primase interactions with DNA template and replicative helicase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 7167-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic structures show that the ZBDs of the T7 primase and of the primase of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly known as Bacillus stearothermophilus) are similar in their overall structures (6Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Modular architecture of the bacteriophage T7 primase couples RNA primer synthesis to DNA synthesis.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Pan H. Wigley D.B. Structure of the zinc-binding domain of Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA primase.Structure. 2000; 8: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). With the exception of some misaligned regions at the N terminus of the G. stearothermophilus primase and the C terminus of the T7 primase, the two enzymes exhibit a similar folding in the zinc-spanning region (Fig. 1). Both primases have four antiparallel β-sheets forming two loops in which cysteines (or a histidine) coordinate a zinc ion. Despite these resemblances, T7 primase recognizes 5′-GTC-3′ in the template, whereas G. stearothermophilus primase recognizes either 5′-TTA-3′ or 5′-CTA-3′ (22Thirlway J. Soultanas P. In the Bacillus stearothermophilus DnaB-DnaG complex, the activities of the two proteins are modulated by distinct but overlapping networks of residues.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1534-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify a region critical to the function of the ZBD, we have constructed altered T7 primases containing homologous portion of the G. stearothermophilus primase and examined their ability to catalyze template-directed synthesis of oligoribonucleotides and to deliver them to DNA polymerase. In addition, a collection of proteins consisting of a variety of amino acid substitutions in the vicinity of zinc-coordinating residues was generated and analyzed to examine their interaction with the template DNA. Our results lead us to conclude that the zinc-binding motif is per se not responsible for sequence recognition. However, its interaction with the RNA polymerase domain is critical for DNA binding and hence for sequence recognition. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technology and Dharmacon. Plasmid DNA purification kits and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resins were from Qiagen. Restriction endonucleases, Deep Vent® polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Radiolabeled nucleotides were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sensor chips and reagents for surface plasmon resonance studies were from GE Healthcare. Alterations at selective positions of the ZBD were introduced into plasmids expressing either the entire T7 gene 4 (pET24-gp4 or pET28-gp4) or the T7 DNA primase coding region (pET24-g4P) following procedures described previously (7Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. Essential lysine residues in the RNA polymerase domain of the gene 4 primase-helicase of bacteriophage T7.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing alterations in gene 4 was generated by PCR and incubated with NdeI and BstBI. The insert DNA purified on an agarose gel was ligated into the plasmid treated with the same restriction enzymes. After the presence of the alteration was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the entire gene 4 coding region, the resulting plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Proteins were overproduced by inducing cells with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h after the culture reached A600 of around 1. A full-length gene 4 protein containing no His tag was purified as described previously (7Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. Essential lysine residues in the RNA polymerase domain of the gene 4 primase-helicase of bacteriophage T7.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using DEAE-anion exchange column chromatography instead of ATP-agarose affinity chromatography. The ATP-agarose affinity chromatography was omitted to avoid use of EDTA, a potential chelator for zinc ion during the protein elution step. Proteins containing a His tag at the N terminus were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by DEAE-anion exchange column chromatography (23Zhu B. Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. An in trans interaction at the interface of the helicase and primase domains of the hexameric gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 modulates their activities.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23842-23851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All purified proteins were over 90% pure as judged on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. E. coli DH5α (0.3 ml) harboring a plasmid that expresses T7 gene 4 was cultured until an A600 of around 1 and mixed with serially diluted T7Δ4 phage lacking gene 4 (0.1 ml) in 3 ml of soft agar. The mixture was plated on the top of LB plate, and the plaques that emerged after incubation at 37 °C for 5 h were counted. Additional deletions around gene 4 in T7Δ4 (T7 nucleotide 11,481–13,621) prevent homologous recombination between the phage and the gene 4-expressing plasmid. Reaction mixture contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 0.1 mm each of ATP and [α-32P]CTP (0.1 μCi/μl), indicated oligomer DNA containing a primase recognition site (5′-GGGTC-3′ or 5′-TGGTC-3′) or 10 nm M13 ssDNA, and the indicated amount of gene 4 protein or primase. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 μl of sequencing dye, and reaction products were separated on a 25% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 3 m urea. The gel was dried for autoradiography, and the amount of CMP incorporated into the major product, the tetraribonucleotide, was determined using a Fuji BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. T7 DNA polymerase cannot initiate synthesis on ssDNA. Gene 4 primase allows T7 DNA polymerase to initiate synthesis on ssDNA by synthesizing tetraribonucleotides for use as primers by the polymerase or by delivering preformed oligoribonucleotides to the polymerase. The ability of T7 gene 4 primase to support DNA synthesis was examined in the following assay. The reaction contained 10 nm M13 ssDNA, 0.3 mm each of [α-3H]dGTP (10 cpm/pmol), dCTP, dATP, and dTTP, 200 nm T7 gene 4 protein, 10 nm T7 DNA polymerase, and either a mixture of 0.1 mm each of NTPs or the indicated amount of preformed tetraribonucleotide ACCA in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm potassium glutamate. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. The reaction products were spotted onto a DE81 membrane (Whatman), and the membrane was washed three times with 10 ml of 0.3 m ammonium formate, pH 8.0, to remove unincorporated radioactive nucleotide. The amount of DNA synthesis was determined by measuring the radioactive products retained on the membrane. A library of plasmids containing multiple amino acid substitutions for Pro-16, Asp-18, and Asn-19 was constructed by introducing mixed codons into the coding region using a random mutagenic primer (5′-GT GTA TTT CTT TAC CAC ATT NNK TGT NNK NNK TGT GGG AGT AGT GAT GGG-3′ where N = any base; K = G or T; mutated codon shown in boldface). The mixture of E. coli cells containing the plasmid library was infected with T7 phage Δ4-1 lacking T7 nucleotides 11,563–11,806 (24Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Washington M.T. Patel S.S. Studier F.W. Selection, identification, and genetic analysis of random mutants in the cloned primase/helicase gene of bacteriophage T7.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26819-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The presence of the T7 nucleotide 11,333–11,950 in the plasmid allows for homologous recombination with the phage genome to produce phages containing various codons at the three positions in the ZBD. Upon plating the lysate on E. coli lacking a gene 4 expressing plasmid, only phages that acquire a functional gene 4 coding region as the result of homologous recombination produce plaques. E. coli cells (4 × 105) harboring the plasmid library were infected with the T7 phage Δ4-1 (2 × 104 pfu), and the resulting lysate was collected. Plaques were isolated, and the sequence of their gene 4 coding region (T7 nucleotide 11,565 to 12,200) was determined by DNA sequence analysis. The binding affinity of T7 primase to ssDNA was determined using surface plasmon resonance as described previously (25Lee S.J. Zhu B. Hamdan S.M. Richardson C.C. Mechanism of sequence-specific template binding by the DNA primase of bacteriophage T7.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4372-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Single-stranded 25-mer DNA biotinylated at the 5′ end was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip. Binding of protein was detected by flowing the indicated primase (10 μm) over the chip in a binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. The surface of the chip was regenerated by injecting 100 μl of 1 m NaCl and 50 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 100 μl/min to remove bound proteins. Binding signal was determined by subtracting the nonspecific signal from a control flow cell in which biotin was immobilized instead of biotinylated DNA. The structures of the ZBDs of T7 DNA primase and G. stearothermophilus primase are similar especially near the zinc atom as seen in their superimposed structures (Fig. 1, A and B). An alignment of amino acid sequences shows that their secondary structures are also conserved (Fig. 1C). Yet the two primases recognize different trinucleotide sequences for primer synthesis as follows: 5′-GTC-3′ for T7 primase and 5′-TTA-3′ or 5′-CTA-3′ for G. stearothermophilus primase. To identify a region responsible for this divergent template recognition, we used homolog-scanning mutagenesis of T7 primase using G. stearothermophilus primase (26Cunningham B.C. Jhurani P. Ng P. Wells J.A. Receptor and antibody epitopes in human growth hormone identified by homolog-scanning mutagenesis.Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A portion of the ZBD of T7 DNA primase in the vicinity of the zinc ion (Phe-11 to Phe-35) was divided into five segments based on the similarity of secondary structure to that of G. stearothermophilus primase. Each of the segments was replaced with the homologous region of the ZBD of G. stearothermophilus, generating five hybrid T7 gene 4 proteins containing a portion of the ZBD of G. stearothermophilus (Fig. 1). The effect of the alterations on the in vivo function of gene 4 protein was examined by a phage growth complementation assay. In this assay, the viability of T7 phage lacking the entire gene 4 (T7Δ4) depends on the expression of gene 4 from a plasmid harbored in E. coli. As shown in Table 1, compared with wild-type protein, all hybrid proteins exhibit a 102 to 107-fold decrease in their ability to support growth of T7Δ4. Plaque sizes obtained with the hybrid proteins were also significantly smaller than those observed with the wild-type gene 4 protein (data not shown). In particular, alterations of a segment containing Cys-17 and Cys-20 that coordinate the zinc (H2) and a segment neighboring another zinc-coordinating cysteine, Cys-36 (H5), result in a more severe defect than the other alterations (H1, H3, and H4).TABLE 1Ability of gene 4 hybrid proteins to complement growth of T7 phage lacking gene 4Gene 4 proteinEfficiency of platingWild type1H10.03H22 × 10−7H30.03H40.06H51 × 10−4 Open table in a new tab To determine defects that lead to the loss of in vivo function, the hybrid proteins were purified and examined in biochemical assays. In all assays, the 56-kDa gene 4 protein lacking ZBD was included for comparison. At first, the ability of gene 4 protein to catalyze template-directed oligoribonucleotide synthesis was examined using a short ssDNA template containing the sequence 5′-GGGTC-3′. All hybrid proteins as well as the 56-kDa gene 4 protein fail to synthesize oligoribonucleotide (Fig. 2A). Because alterations of the ZBD could change specificity of the primase recognition site, we used M13 ssDNA that should contain all possible recognition sequences for primer synthesis. Again, none of the hybrid gene 4 proteins synthesize any oligoribonucleotide on M13 ssDNA (Fig. 2B). The multiple products observed with wild-type protein reflect the use of minor recognition sites within the M13 DNA sequence (4Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Template recognition sequence for RNA primer synthesis by gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Use of radiolabeled NTPs other than CTP did also not yield any oligoribonucleotides synthesized by the hybrid proteins (data not shown). The loss of ability to catalyze the template-directed synthesis of oligoribonucleotides could result from defective function of either the ZBD or RPD (10Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. Interaction of adjacent primase domains within the hexameric gene 4 helicase-primase of bacteriophage T7.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 12703-12708Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, all the hybrid DNA primases, like the 56-kDa gene 4 protein, catalyze the template-independent synthesis of random diribonucleotides (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, the inability to mediate template-directed oligoribonucleotide synthesis appears to arise from a defect in the ZBD. Oligoribonucleotides synthesized by DNA primase are delivered to DNA polymerase to initiate lagging strand synthesis. This function of the primase was examined in an RNA-primed DNA synthesis assay under two different conditions. In the first experiment, a mixture of all four NTPs was supplied as precursors for oligoribonucleotides. Wild-type gene 4 protein supports DNA synthesis by T7 DNA polymerase on M13 ssDNA by providing oligoribonucleotides that serve as primers to initiate DNA synthesis (Fig. 3A). Not surprisingly, in view of their inability to synthesize template-directed oligoribonucleotide synthesis, no DNA synthesis was observed with any of the hybrid gene 4 proteins (Fig. 3A). The lack of DNA synthesis confirms the absence of oligoribonucleotides because DNA synthesis would amplify their presence. In the second experiment, preformed synthetic ACCC was supplied to gene 4 protein to bypass the step of oligoribonucleotide synthesis. In the absence of gene 4 protein, T7 DNA polymerase is unable to use a tetraribonucleotide as a primer (7Lee S.J. Richardson C.C.

However, as shown in Fig. 3B, wild-type gene 4 protein supports DNA synthesis by T7 DNA polymerase proportional to the amount of ACCC supplied (Fig. 3B). The ability of gene 4 protein to stabilize and transfer preformed oligoribonucleotides to the polymerase efficiently is dependent on the correct recognition sequence (27Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C.
