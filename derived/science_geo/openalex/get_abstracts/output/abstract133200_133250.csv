https://openalex.org/W2154204770,"Surveys of risk behaviors have been hobbled by their reliance on respondents to report accurately about engaging in behaviors that are highly sensitive and may be illegal. An audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (audio-CASI) technology for measuring those behaviors was tested with 1690 respondents in the 1995 National Survey of Adolescent Males. The respondents were randomly assigned to answer questions using either audio-CASI or a more traditional self-administered questionnaire. Estimates of the prevalence of male-male sex, injection drug use, and sexual contact with intravenous drug users were higher by factors of 3 or more when audio-CASI was used. Increased reporting was also found for several other risk behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2007442485,"The neural basis of navigation by humans was investigated with functional neuroimaging of brain activity during navigation in a familiar, yet complex virtual reality town. Activation of the right hippocampus was strongly associated with knowing accurately where places were located and navigating accurately between them. Getting to those places quickly was strongly associated with activation of the right caudate nucleus. These two right-side brain structures function in the context of associated activity in right inferior parietal and bilateral medial parietal regions that support egocentric movement through the virtual town, and activity in other left-side regions (hippocampus, frontal cortex) probably involved in nonspatial aspects of navigation. These findings outline a network of brain areas that support navigation in humans and link the functions of these regions to physiological observations in other mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2008855387,"Xenopus oocytes convert a continuously variable stimulus, the concentration of the maturation-inducing hormone progesterone, into an all-or-none biological response—oocyte maturation. Here evidence is presented that the all-or-none character of the response is generated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Analysis of individual oocytes showed that the response of MAPK to progesterone or Mos was equivalent to that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of at least 35, more than 10 times the Hill coefficient for the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin. The response can be accounted for by the intrinsic ultrasensitivity of the oocyte's MAPK cascade and a positive feedback loop in which the cascade is embedded. These findings provide a biochemical rationale for the all-or-none character of this cell fate switch."
https://openalex.org/W2026674566,"In plants, potassium serves an essential role as an osmoticum and charge carrier. Its uptake by roots occurs by poorly defined mechanisms. To determine the role of potassium channels in planta, we performed a reverse genetic screen and identified an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant in which the AKT1 channel gene was disrupted. Roots of this mutant lacked inward-rectifying potassium channels and displayed reduced potassium (rubidium-86) uptake. Compared with wild type, mutant plants grew poorly on media with a potassium concentration of 100 micromolar or less. These results and membrane potential measurements suggest that the AKT1 channel mediates potassium uptake from solutions that contain as little as 10 micromolar potassium."
https://openalex.org/W1993808418,"Integrin-mediated reorganization of cell shape leads to an altered cellular phenotype. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, initiated by binding of soluble antibody to α5β1 integrin, led to increased expression of the collagenase-1 gene in rabbit synovial fibroblasts. Activation of the guanosine triphosphate–binding protein Rac1, which was downstream of the integrin, was necessary for this process, and expression of activated Rac1 was sufficient to increase expression of collagenase-1. Rac1 activation generated reactive oxygen species that were essential for nuclear factor kappa B–dependent transcriptional regulation of interleukin-1α, which, in an autocrine manner, induced collagenase-1 gene expression. Remodeling of the extracellular matrix and consequent alterations of integrin-mediated adhesion and cytoarchitecture are central to development, wound healing, inflammation, and malignant disease. The resulting activation of Rac1 may lead to altered gene regulation and alterations in cellular morphogenesis, migration, and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2049508647,"Cdc2, the kinase that induces mitosis, is regulated by checkpoints that couple mitosis to the completion of DNA replication and repair. The repair checkpoint kinase Chk1 regulates Cdc25, a phosphatase that activates Cdc2. Effectors of the replication checkpoint evoked by hydroxyurea (HU) are unknown. Treatment of fission yeast with HU stimulated the kinase Cds1, which appears to phosphorylate the kinase Wee1, an inhibitor of Cdc2. The protein kinase Cds1 was also required for a large HU-induced increase in the amount of Mik1, a second inhibitor of Cdc2. HU-induced arrest of cell division was abolished in cds1 chk1 cells. Thus, Cds1 and Chk1 appear to jointly enforce the replication checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W1967203013,"p53 is required for hypoxia-induced apoptosisin vivo, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. Conversely, induction of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transactivator stimulates transcription of a number of genes crucial to survival of the hypoxic state. Here we demonstrate that p53 represses HIF-1-stimulated transcription. Although higher levels of p53 are required to inhibit HIF than are necessary to transcriptionally activate p53 target genes, these levels of p53 are similar to those that stimulate cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, an early event in apoptosis. Transfection of full-length p300 stimulates both p53-dependent and HIF-dependent transcription but does not relieve p53-mediated inhibition of HIF. In contrast, a p300 fragment, which binds to p53 but not to HIF-1, prevents p53-dependent repression of HIF activity. Transcriptionally inactive p53, mutated in its DNA binding domain, retains the ability to block HIF transactivating activity, whereas a transcriptionally inactive double point mutant defective for p300 binding does not inhibit HIF. Finally, depletion of doxorubicin-induced endogenous p53 by E6 protein attenuates doxorubicin-stimulated inhibition of HIF, suggesting that a p53 level sufficient for HIF inhibition can be achieved in vivo.

Koch C.J. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). Indeed, p53 is the most frequently inactivated gene in solid tumors, and in animal tumor models, hypoxia selects against wild type p53 (8Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which p53 mediates apoptosis in hypoxic tumor cells is not known. Hypoxic conditions in vitro as well as in vivo result in induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), 1The abbreviations used are: HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; Epo, erythropoietin; wtp53, wild type p53; MOI, multiplicity of infection; Luc, luciferase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; CMV, cytomegalovirus. the limiting, hypoxia-inducible subunit of the HIF-1 transactivator (9Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Sememza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). HIF-1, in turn, stimulates transcription of a number of genes important for tumor survival under hypoxic conditions in vivo, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin (Epo), and several glycolytic enzymes (10Guillemin K. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Tumors in which hypoxia cannot induce HIF-1 transcriptional activity remain small and fail to metastasize (11Maxwell P.H. Dachs G.U. Gleadle J.M. Nicholls L.G. Harris A.L. Stratford I.J. Hankinson O.

We have recently shown that hypoxic induction of p53 requires concomitant induction of HIF-1α, and that HIF-1α binds to and stabilizes p53 (12An W.G. Kanekal M. Simon M.C. Maltepe E. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). We found previously that HIF-1α had no direct effect on p53 transcriptional activity. We now report that association of HIF-1α and p53 results in inhibition of HIF-stimulated transcription. This requires a higher p53 level than is necessary for transcriptional activation of several endogenous p53-responsive promoters but correlates well with the level of p53 necessary to cause apoptosis. SKBr3 and MCF7 are human breast cancer cell lines obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and PC3M is a highly metastatic variant of the prostate cancer cell line, PC3. SKBr3 contains one mutated, transcriptionally inactive p53 allele, MCF7 contains transcriptionally active wild type p53 (wtp53), and PC3M cells are p53-null. Ad-LacZ, a β-galactosidase-expressing, replication-deficient adenovirus, and Ad-p53, a wtp53-expressing, replication-deficient adenovirus, were obtained from B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center). Viral titer was determined as described previously (13Blagosklonny M.V. El-Deiry W.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Multiplicity of infection (MOI) is defined as the ratio of total number of viruses used in a particular infection per number of cancer cells to be infected (i.e. number of viruses per cell). Plasmids WWP-Luc, a p21 promoter-luciferase construct, PG13-Luc, containing a generic p53 response element, pCMVβ.wtp53, and the p53 mutant p53–273H were obtained from B. Vogelstein. Bax-Luc, a Bax promoter-luciferase construct and the p53 double point mutant p53(22/23) were obtained from K. Vousden (ABL Basic Research Program, NCI-FCRDC). The pCMVβ.HA-HIF-1α expression plasmid was obtained from D. Livingston (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). An HIF-responsive, VEGF promoter-derived luciferase construct containing four amplified HIF-1 binding sites (VEGF-Luc), inserted into a pGL2-promoter vector was obtained from A. J. Giaccia (Stanford University) and described previously (14Mazure N.M. Chen E.Y. Yeh P. Laderoute K.R. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3436-3440PubMed Google Scholar). An HIF-responsive, erythropoietin promoter-derived luciferase construct (Epo-Luc) and its HIF-insensitive mutant variant (mEpo-Luc), inserted into a pGL3-Promoter vector were obtained from F. Bunn and E. Huang (Harvard Medical School). The control luciferase plasmid, pGL2-control, driven by SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences, was purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The full-length p300 expression plasmid, pCMVβ.p300, and the p53-binding p300 fragment, pCMVβ.p300(1514–1922), were obtained from K. Kelly (NCI). pCMV.β-galactosidase was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). pCMV.neo16E6 was obtained from K. Vousden. 8 × 105 or 4 × 106 cells were plated in T25 flasks or 6-well plates (Costar, Acton, MA), respectively. The next day, cells were transfected with plasmids in the presence of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 6–12 h of incubation with the plasmid-lipid suspension, the medium was changed, and cells were grown for an additional 24 h, unless otherwise indicated. The cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase activity as described previously (12An W.G. Kanekal M. Simon M.C. Maltepe E. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved with 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for detection of p53, Mdm-2, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) as described previously (15Blagosklonny M.V. Toretskey J. Bohen S. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8379-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was monitored by [3H]thymidine incorporation (13Blagosklonny M.V. El-Deiry W.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We initially investigated the effects of wtp53 on HIF-1-responsive transcription in SKBr3 and PC3M cell lines. Transient expression of HIF-1 dramatically induced transcription of two HIF-dependent reporter constructs, Epo-Luc (containing an HIF-responsive element from the erythropoietin gene) and VEGF-Luc (containing HIF-responsive elements from the VEGF gene) in both cell lines, whereas co-transfection of wtp53 abrogated this induction (Fig. 1,A, B, and D). Dose-response analysis showed near-maximal inhibition of HIF-1-stimulated transcription (using 0.5 μg of HIF-1) by as little as 0.1 μg of wtp53 in SKBr3 cells and 0.5 μg of wtp53 in PC3M cells (Fig. 1, A andB). In order to determine whether transactivating capability was essential for p53-mediated HIF inhibition, we next examined the HIF-1 inhibitory activity of the p53 “DNA contact” mutant p53–273H (16Rolley N. Butcher S. Milner J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 763-770PubMed Google Scholar), which failed to transactivate three independent p53-responsive reporters: PG13-Luc, WWP-Luc, and Bax-Luc (data not shown). Although lacking transactivating capability, p53–273H repressed HIF-1-driven transcription in both SKBr3 and PC3M cells (Fig. 1, A, B, and D), demonstrating that neither DNA binding nor transactivation is essential for p53-mediated suppression of HIF-1 activity. To confirm the specificity of this phenomenon, we tested the effects of both wtp53 and p53–273H on a control luciferase plasmid, pGL2-control (VEGF-Luc is a pGL2-based reporter and Epo-Luc is a pGL3-based reporter), in transiently transfected PC3M cells. At the concentrations used in these experiments, neither p53 construct significantly inhibited the SV40-driven luciferase activity generated from pGL2-control-transfected cells (Fig. 1 C). Although p53-mediated suppression of HIF activity can be clearly demonstrated, it requires higher p53 levels than are necessary to observe p53-mediated transactivation. Thus, transactivation of PG13-Luc in SKBr3 cells requires co-transfection of 10–20-fold less p53 than is necessary to obtain significant HIF-1 inhibition (Fig.2 A). Because transfection does not introduce p53 into 100% of the cells tested, it is difficult to compare suppression of HIF activity with the growth inhibitory and apoptotic activity of p53. Since we demonstrated previously that essentially 100% of cells infected with the p53-containing adenovirus Ad-p53 express wtp53 protein following infection (minimum MOI = 2; see Ref. 13Blagosklonny M.V. El-Deiry W.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we used this approach to further explore the relationship of p53 expression to transactivation and HIF suppression, respectively. We determined the MOI of Ad-p53 required in SKBr3 cells to yield maximal inhibition of Epo-Luc (Fig. 2 B) and DNA synthesis (Fig. 2 C), stimulation of PARP cleavage (Fig.2 D), induction of Mdm-2 protein (Fig. 2 E), and stimulation of Bax-Luc (Fig. 2 F). To control for any nonspecific effects of viral titer, cells were infected with 32 MOI of Ad-LacZ (second bar/lane in Fig. 2, B–F). PARP cleavage is an early event in apoptosis, and inhibition of DNA synthesis is a marker of growth arrest. The data demonstrate that near-maximal inhibition of DNA synthesis, Mdm-2 induction, and transactivation of Bax-Luc occur at an Ad-p53 MOI of 2–4. In contrast, both significant inhibition of HIF-responsive transcription and stimulation of PARP cleavage do not occur until an MOI of 16–32 is reached. Infection with Ad-LacZ was consistently without effect. Thus, whereas the transactivating function of p53 correlates with induction of growth arrest, suppression of HIF activity correlates with the higher amount of p53 required to initiate apoptosis. Similar to what was found in the previous transfection experiment (Fig.2 A), 8–16-fold more p53 was needed to suppress HIF activity and stimulate PARP cleavage than was required to support transactivation of p53 target genes and to cause growth arrest. These results are in agreement with our earlier observation that transactivation does not play a role in the inhibition of HIF activity by p53. Taken together with our recent observation that p53 co-precipitates with HIF-1α (12An W.G. Kanekal M. Simon M.C. Maltepe E. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), the data fit a model in which direct association of HIF-1α with p53 results in HIF inhibition. Both HIF-1α and p53 bind to p300, and p300 is required for full activity of both transactivators (17Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M.

Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to determine whether p300 plays any role in p53-mediated HIF inhibition. We first determined whether exogenous p300 could restore HIF activity in the presence of p53. We transfected PC3M cells with Epo-Luc and HIF-1α, plus either CMV-β-galactosidase (control plasmid) or wtp53, and full-length p300 (Fig.3 A). Although exogenous p300 augmented HIF-dependent transcriptional activity, as reported previously (17Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), it could not reverse p53-mediated inhibition of this activity. HIF-1α and p53 bind to distinct regions of p300. The HIF binding site has been localized to a region encompassed by amino acids 346–410 (17Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), whereas p53 has been reported to bind to a p300 fragment comprising amino acids 1514–1922 (18Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 21Gu W. Shi X.-L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that p53 and HIF-1α can bind to p300 simultaneously, leading to interference by p53 in HIF/p300-mediated transactivation. This model predicts that exogenous p300 would be unable to reverse HIFsuppression as long as intracellular p53 levels exceed HIF levels. Such a stoichiometric hypothesis can also explain why significantly higher amounts of p53 are necessary to inhibit HIF than are required to transactivate target genes and why p53 need not be transactivation competent to mediate HIF suppression. Based on this model, a p300 fragment that bound p53 but not HIF-1α would be expected to block p53-mediated HIF repression. To test this, we repeated the above experiment but co-transfected with the p53-binding p300 fragment, p300(1514–1922), instead of full-length p300. Since it lacks the HIF-1α binding site this fragment did not further stimulate HIF activity, but it markedly ameliorated p53-mediated inhibition of this activity (Fig. 3 A). Co-transfection of p300(1514–1922) did not affect the level of expression of p53 (not shown), but it did abrogate the ability of p53 to induce endogenous Mdm-2 (see Fig. 3 A, inset), previously shown to be dependent on p53/p300 interaction (21Gu W. Shi X.-L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). These data suggest that p300(1514–1922) reversed p53-mediated inhibition of HIF-dependent transcription by sequestering p53 and preventing its association with the endogenous pool of p300. In order to further explore the requirement for p300 in p53-mediated inhibition of HIF-1, we tested the anti-HIF activity of a p53 double point mutant, p53(22/23), which is mutated at residues 22 and 23 in the amino-terminal transactivating domain (5Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K.H. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 22Lin J.Y. Chen J.D. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and does not bind to p300 (21Gu W. Shi X.-L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3 B, this mutant was unable to suppress HIF-1 activity in PC3m cells. Although 0.25 μg of wtp53 markedly inhibited HIF-1, p53(22/23) was inactive even when transfected at 2 μg. Both wtp53 and p53(22/23) were expressed to similar levels, as monitored by Western blotting (not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that p53 must bind to p300 in order to inhibit HIF-1. Although exogenously supplied p53 inhibits HIF-1-driven transcription at levels that initiate apoptotic events, we wished to determine whether endogenous p53 could be induced to display similar activity. Thus, we transfected MCF7 cells, which contain wtp53, with Epo-Luc and HIF-1α and examined the effect on reporter activity of the DNA-damaging drug doxorubicin, a potent inducer of wtp53. Treatment with doxorubicin led to marked elevation of p53 and significantly blunted HIF transcriptional activity (Fig.4). Co-transfection of a human papilloma virus E6-expressing plasmid together with Epo-Luc and HIF-1α reversed this inhibition (Fig. 4). In contrast, doxorubicin had no effect on HIF-1 activity in p53-null PC3M cells (data not shown). In summary, we have demonstrated that p53 is able to repress HIF activity in a manner not requiring the transactivating function of p53. That a significantly greater amount of p53 is necessary to inhibit HIF than is required to transactivate p53 target genes or cause growth arrest can be explained by a stoichiometric model in which p53 must saturably bind to HIF/p300-containing complexes in order to inhibit HIF. The physiologic relevance of this phenomenon is supported by two observations. First, the level of p53, which must be reached to mediate HIF repression, is equivalent to that at which PARP cleavage becomes detectable, and second, this level of p53 can be reached in vivo following exposure to a commonly used chemotherapeutic."
https://openalex.org/W2001488223,"The effects of selection by host immune responses on transmission dynamics was analyzed in a broad class of antigenically diverse pathogens. Strong selection can cause pathogen populations to stably segregate into discrete strains with nonoverlapping antigenic repertoires. However, over a wide range of intermediate levels of selection, strain structure is unstable, varying in a manner that is either cyclical or chaotic. These results have implications for the interpretation of longitudinal epidemiological data on strain or serotype abundance, design of surveillance strategies, and the assessment of multivalent vaccine trials."

Plant enzymes that catalyze the formation of the Δ12 acetylenic bond in 9-octadecen-12-ynoic acid and the Δ12 epoxy group in 12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid were characterized, and two genes, similar in sequence, were cloned. When these complementary DNAs were expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana , the content of acetylenic or epoxidated fatty acids in the seeds increased from 0 to 25 or 15 percent, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1998077698,"It has recently been shown that zirconium tungstate (ZrW2O8) exhibits isotropic negative thermal expansion over its entire temperature range of stability. This rather unusual behavior makes this compound particularly suitable for testing model predictions of a connection between negative thermal expansion and pressure-induced amorphization. High-pressure x-ray diffraction and Raman scattering experiments showed that ZrW2O8 becomes progressively amorphous from 1.5 to 3.5 gigapascals. The amorphous phase was retained after pressure release, but the original crystalline phase returned after annealing at 923 kelvin. The results indicate a general trend between negative thermal expansion and pressure-induced amorphization in highly flexible framework structures."
https://openalex.org/W1540151276,Some bacteria form intracellular nanometer-scale crystals of greigite (Fe 3 S 4 ) that cause the bacteria to be oriented in magnetic fields. Transmission electron microscope observations showed that ferrimagnetic greigite in these bacteria forms from nonmagnetic mackinawite (tetragonal FeS) and possibly from cubic FeS. These precursors apparently transform into greigite by rearrangement of iron atoms over a period of days to weeks. Neither pyrrhotite nor pyrite was found. These results have implications for the interpretation of the presence of pyrrhotite and greigite in the martian meteorite ALH84001.

Signals from this receptor are essential for passage of thymocytes through a key developmental checkpoint in the thymus. These signals were efficiently delivered in vivo by a truncated form of the murine pre-TCR that lacked all of its extracellular immunoglobulin domains. De novo expression of the truncated pre-TCR or an intact αβTCR was sufficient to activate characteristic TCR signaling pathways in a T cell line. These findings support the view that recognition of an extracellular ligand is not required for pre-TCR function.

Because intranuclear inclusions have recently been shown to be a common feature of many of these codon reiteration diseases, the nuclear localization and activity of tissue transglutaminase was examined. Subcellular fractionation of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells demonstrated that 93% of tissue transglutaminase is localized to the cytosol. Of the 7% found in the nucleus, 6% copurified with the chromatin-associated proteins, and the remaining 1% was in the nuclear matrix fraction. In situ transglutaminase activity was measured in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments of control cells, as well as cells treated with the calcium-mobilizing agent maitotoxin to increase endogenous tissue transglutaminase activity. These studies revealed that tissue transglutaminase was activated in the nucleus, a finding that was further supported by cytochemical analysis. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that nuclear proteins modified by transglutaminase exhibited a discrete punctate, as well as a diffuse staining pattern. Furthermore, different proteins were modified by transglutaminase in the nucleus compared with the cytosol. The results of these experiments clearly demonstrate localization of tissue transglutaminase in the nucleus that can be activated. These findings may have important implications in the formation of the insoluble nuclear inclusions, which are characteristic of codon reiteration diseases such as Huntington's disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias.

These findings may have important implications in the formation of the insoluble nuclear inclusions, which are characteristic of codon reiteration diseases such as Huntington's disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias. Numerous adult onset neurodegenerative diseases are caused by unstable, expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats within the coding region of an affected gene, which result in the synthesis of disease-specific proteins with expanded polyglutamine domains. Although there are numerous hypotheses concerning the contribution of these proteins with expanded glutamine repeats to the pathogenesis of the diseases, the mechanisms remain unknown (1Bates G. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 237-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 3Paulson H.L. Fischbeck K.H. Annu. Rev.

Recent studies have demonstrated that intranuclear inclusions are a common feature of most of these codon reiteration diseases and that the disease-related protein forms the inclusions (5Paulson H.L. Perez M.K. Trottier Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Subramony S.H. Das S.S. Vig P. Mandel J.-L. Fischbeck K.H. Pittman R.N.

Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms causing the formation of these inclusions are not clear. Previously it had been hypothesized that tissue transglutaminase may be involved in the pathological process of the CAG repeat diseases (7Green H. Cell. 1993; 74: 955-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Tissue transglutaminase is both a signal transducing GTP-binding protein (8Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) and a transamidating enzyme (9Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB. J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). As a member of the transglutaminase family, tissue transglutaminase catalyzes a calcium-dependent acyl transfer reaction between the γ-carboxamide group of a peptide bound glutamine residue and either an ε-amino group of peptide bound lysine yielding a isopeptide bond or the primary amino group of a polyamine resulting in a (γ-glutamyl)-polyamine bond (9Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB. J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Tissue transglutaminase is found within neurons (10Miller C.C.J. Anderton B.H. J.

Candi E. Gentile V. Davies P.J.A. Piacentini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6584-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and axonal growth and regeneration (13Eitan S. Schwartz M.

Science. 1994; 264: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because the polypeptide bound glutamine is the primary determining factor for a transglutaminase substrate, Green (7Green H. Cell. 1993; 74: 955-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) hypothesized that there may be a threshold effect and that the addition of glutamine residues beyond a certain number may allow the mutant protein to be modified by transglutaminase and result in the formation of cross-linked products. Investigators have since demonstrated that peptides containing glutamine repeats are substrates for tissue transglutaminase (15Kahlem P. Terre C. Green H. Dijan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14580-14585Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and that transglutaminase cross-links expanded polyglutamine domains with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase resulting in inactivation of the enzyme (16Cooper A.J.L. Sheu K.-F.R. Burke J.R. Onodera O. Strittmatter W.J. Roses A.D. Blass J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2604-12609Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In an earlier investigation of GTP-binding proteins in rabbit liver nuclei, tissue transglutaminase was tentatively identified as a nuclear GTP-binding protein (17Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15874Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, in this previous study the in situ activity of the transglutaminase was not examined. Considering these and other findings, the purpose of this study was to determine the specific nuclear localization of tissue transglutaminase and the in situ activation of nuclear tissue transglutaminase. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown as described previously (18Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To induce expression of tissue transglutaminase, cells were grown in the low serum medium containing 20 μm retinoic acid (18Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out 6–9 days after the addition of retinoic acid. Cells were fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions, and the nuclei were further fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble, nuclear chromatin and nuclear matrix compartments as described previously (19Greenwood J.A. Johnson G.V.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). To evaluate the expression level of tissue transglutaminase in cell fractions, samples were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with monoclonal antibody 4C1, which recognizes tissue transglutaminase (20Johnson G.V.W. Cox T.M. Lockhart J.P. Zinnerman M.D. Miller M.L. Powers R.E. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); monoclonal antibody 5H1 (21Wang Y. Loomis P.A. Zinkowski R.P. Binder L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which recognizes β-tubulin; or monoclonal antibody MAB052 (Chemicon), which recognizes histone proteins. After incubation with primary antibody, blots were washed and probed with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, washed again, and then developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SH-SY5Y cells were labeled with 2 mm 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (Pierce), a biotinylated polyamine, for 60 min prior to treatment with 1 nm maitotoxin for 15 min. The cells were subsequently harvested and fractionated into nuclear and cytosolic components (19Greenwood J.A. Johnson G.V.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the protein concentrations were determined. Transglutaminase activity was quantitated by measuring the presence of incorporated 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine into proteins by a microplate assay as described by Zhang et al. (18Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To visualize the proteins into which the 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine had been incorporated, samples (10 μg of protein) were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce). The blots were developed as described above. SH-SY5Y cells were replated onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. Cells were preincubated for 60 min with 2 mm 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine and subsequently treated with 0.5 nm maitotoxin for 20 min. Tissue transglutaminase was localized with the anti-tissue transglutaminase monoclonal antibody CUB 7402 (NeoMarkers) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoLabs), and transglutaminase activity was detected by FITC-streptavidin 1The abbreviation used is: FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. staining (18Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular localization of tissue transglutaminase, cells were separated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions, and then the nuclear fraction was separated further into the Triton X-100 fraction containing lipids and soluble proteins, the chromatin and associated protein fraction, and the nuclear matrix fraction. Equal amounts of protein (10 μg) from each fraction were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody to tissue transglutaminase (Fig. 1). To confirm that the isolated nuclei were free from cytoplasmic contamination, the fractions were immunoblotted for β-tubulin, a predominant cytosolic protein. These results revealed that β-tubulin was found almost exclusively in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1). The fractions were also immunoblotted for histones to verify the extraction and isolation of the nuclear fractions. As expected, histone immunoreactivity was present primarily in the chromatin fraction. The presence of histone immunoreactivity in the other fractions was virtually undetectable (Fig. 1). Tissue transglutaminase immunoreactivity was found in the cytosolic, chromatin, and nuclear matrix fractions (Fig. 1). Tissue transglutaminase immunoreactivity in each fraction was determined quantitatively and adjusted for the amount of protein in each fraction. Results from two independent experiments revealed that 93% of total tissue transglutaminase was found in the cytosol, 6% was extracted in the chromatin fraction, and 1% co-purified with the nuclear matrix. To determine if tissue transglutaminase in the nucleus could be activated, an in situ transglutaminase assay was used (18Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The biotinylated polyamine 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine was used as a probe for endogenous tissue transglutaminase activity. Transglutaminases react with glutamine residues in substrate proteins, and then the enzyme-substrate intermediate reacts with an appropriate nearby primary amine. This can be the primary amino group of a polyamine resulting in the covalent incorporation of the polyamine into the protein by a (γ-glutamyl)polyamine bond (9Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB. J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Therefore control and treated cells that had been preincubated with 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine were separated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions, and incorporation of this polyamine derivative into proteins was used as a measure ofin situ transglutaminase activity (22Perry M.J.M. Mahoney S.-A. Haynes L.W. Neuroscience. 1995; 65: 1063-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows that the basalin situ activity of transglutaminase in the nucleus was less than the activity in the cytosol; however, the difference was not significant (p = 0.056, n = 5 separate determinations). To activate tissue transglutaminase, cells were incubated with 1 nm maitotoxin, which activates both voltage-sensitive and ligand gated calcium channels (23Wang K.W. Nath R. Raser K.J. Hajimohammadreza I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In SH-SY5Y cells, 1 nm maitotoxin increases intracellular calcium concentrations approximately 10-fold to 700 nm but does not result in loss of viability during the time course of the experiment (18Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been well documented that increasing the cytoplasmic calcium concentration results in an increase in the nuclear calcium concentration (24Badminton M. Campbell A.K. Rembold C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31210-31214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Santella L. Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1091-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Treatment with 1 nmmaitotoxin resulted in a significant increase in the in situtransglutaminase activity in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 2 A). To examine the transglutaminase-induced modifications of nuclear and cytosolic proteins, fractions were blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin to identify proteins modified with the biotinylated polyamine. A representative blot of this data is shown in Fig. 2 B. These findings show that there are different proteins modified by transglutaminase in the nucleus compared with the cytosol. To further assess the nuclear activity of tissue transglutaminase, a cytochemical approach was used. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine and then treated with 0.5 nmmaitotoxin for 20 min. Control and maitotoxin-treated cells were fixed and immunostained with a monoclonal antibody to tissue transglutaminase and also were probed with FITC-conjugated streptavidin to localize polyamine-modified proteins as a measure of endogenous transglutaminase activity. Transglutaminase was present in control cells (Fig.3, A and C), but transglutaminase activity was very low (Fig. 3, B andC). However, treatment with maitotoxin resulted in a significant increase in transglutaminase activity (as determined by the presence of proteins that had been polyaminated by transglutaminase and visualized with streptavidin-FITC) that was readily evident in the nucleus (Fig. 3, E and F). In addition, an increased presence of transglutaminase in the nucleus was often observed in the maitotoxin-treated cells (Fig. 3 D), indicating that transglutaminase may translocate to the nucleus in response to elevated intracellular calcium levels. Tissue transglutaminase and proteins that had been modified by transglutaminase showed nuclear co-localization (Fig. 3 F). Furthermore, proteins that had been modified by transglutaminase exhibited a discrete punctate as well as a diffuse staining pattern in the nucleus (Fig. 3 E). One pathogenic process that has been proposed to contribute to the neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease, as well as other CAG trinucleotide repeat diseases, is the homodimerization or heterodimerization of the mutant polyglutamine-containing proteins with subsequent stabilization by transglutaminase resulting in the formation of poorly soluble protein aggregates (7Green H. Cell. 1993; 74: 955-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15Kahlem P. Terre C. Green H. Dijan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 2604-12609Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has attained additional support with the recent discovery of intranuclear inclusions, which are common to many codon reiteration diseases and are composed of aggregates of the disease-specific protein (5Paulson H.L. Perez M.K. Trottier Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Subramony S.H. Das S.S. Vig P. Mandel J.-L. Fischbeck K.H. Pittman R.N.

Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar). A previous study presented preliminary evidence that tissue transglutaminase was present in rabbit liver nuclei (17Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15874Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, this study focused on the GTP binding properties of tissue transglutaminase and did not examine the in situ transamidating activity of the enzyme. Considering the potential pathophysiological importance of nuclear tissue transglutaminase, it was of importance to verify the localization of tissue transglutaminase in the nucleus and to determine whether it had transamidating activity in situ. In this study, we clearly demonstrate that tissue transglutaminase localizes to specific nuclear fractions and can be activated in situ. Interestingly, when cells were treated with maitotoxin to increase the intracellular calcium concentration, a distinct punctate as well as diffuse pattern of transglutaminase-modified proteins were readily evident in the nucleus (Fig. 3 E). The identity of the nuclear proteins that have been polyaminated by transglutaminase in the present study are unknown. However, it is intriguing that cotransfection of ataxin-1 containing 30 glutamines and leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein into COS-7 cells resulted in a nuclear distribution similar to that observed for nuclear transglutaminase substrates in this study (26Matilla A. Koshy B.T. Cummings C.J. Isobe T. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The physiological function of nuclear tissue transglutaminase is not known. It has been suggested previously that its G protein activity may be important in the activation of nuclear phospholipase C (17Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15874Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phospholipase C-δ is found in the nucleus (25Santella L. Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1091-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 27Zini M. Martelli A.M. Cocco L. Manzoli F.A. Maraldi N.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and this is the isoform of phospholipase C, which is likely activated by tissue transglutaminase in its capacity as a signal transducing G protein (28Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated recently that core histones are excellent substrates of tissue transglutaminase, and the modification of histones by either cross-linking or incorporation of polyamines has been proposed to play both physiological and pathological roles in nuclear function (29Ballestar E. Abad C. Francos L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18817-18824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In relation to codon reiteration diseases, it was shown that expanded polyglutamine domains tightly bind to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; however, the enzyme is only inactivated when it is cross-linked to the polyglutamine domain by transglutaminase (16Cooper A.J.L. Sheu K.-F.R. Burke J.R. Onodera O. Strittmatter W.J. Roses A.D. Blass J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2604-12609Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These findings are extremely intriguing given the recent findings of Sawa and co-workers (30Sawa A. Khan A.A. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11669-11674Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). They demonstrated that during the cell death process in several cell lines, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is translocated to the nucleus and becomes tightly bound, resisting extraction by DNase or salt treatment. Sawa et al. hypothesized that the inability of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to be extracted from the nucleus could be due to covalent cross-linkage to another protein (30Sawa A. Khan A.A. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11669-11674Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Because transglutaminase localizes to the nucleus and is often up-regulated during apoptosis (31Nemes Jr., Z. Adany R. Balazs M. Boross P. Fesus L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 20577-20583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it may involved in the nuclear modification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase during the cell death process. In addition tissue transglutaminase is also in a position to contribute to the formation of the intranuclear inclusions in the codon reiteration diseases. Further research is required to elucidate the putative roles(s) of nuclear transglutaminase in the cell death process, as well as in the pathology of codon reiteration diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2083580421,"A full-length cDNA for a membrane transporter was isolated from Brassica napus by its sequence homology to a previously cloned Arabidopsis low affinity nitrate transporter. The cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 589 amino acid residues with 12 putative transmembrane domains. The transporter belongs to a multigene family with members that have been identified in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals and that are able to transport a range of different nitrogen-containing substrates, including amino acids, peptides, and nitrate. To identify the substrates of this plant gene, we have expressed the protein in Xenopus oocytes. The properties of the transporter are consistent with a proton cotransport mechanism for nitrate, and the voltage dependence of theK m for nitrate was determined. TheK m for nitrate was shown to increase from 4 to 14 mm as the membrane voltage became more negative from −40 to −180 mV. Oocytes expressing the gene could accumulate internal nitrate to concentrations higher than those measured in water-injected controls. A range of different substrate molecules for the transporter was tested, but of these, histidine gave the largest currents, although the affinity was in the millimolar range. The pH dependence of the activity of the transporter was different for the substrates, with histidine transport favored at alkaline and nitrate at acid external pH. Kinetic analysis of the mechanism of histidine transport suggests a cotransport of protons and the neutral form of the amino acid, with theK m for histidine decreasing at more negative membrane voltages.

The mammalian peptide transporters have been shown to transport a broad range of substrates, including di- and tripeptides (2Mackenzie B. Loo D.D.F. Fei Y.-J. Liu W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and free amino acids (6Yamashita T. Shimada S. Guo W. Sato K. Kohmura E. Hayakawa T. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10205-10211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The family members are characterized by all having a consensus motif, and they have been named the proton-dependent oligopeptidetransporter (POT) family (7Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), or as most members arepeptide transporters, they have also been called the PTR family (8Steiner H.-Y. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, the family also includes plant members that have been identified as nitrate transporters (9Tsay Y.-F. Schroeder J.I. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 705-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 10Lauter F.-R. Ninneman O. Bucher M. Riesmeier J.W. Frommer W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8139-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that another member of this family, isolated from the plant Brassica napus, can transport both the amino acids and nitrate when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In soil, the nitrate concentrations can vary from >1 μmto >10 mm depending on factors such as rainfall and fertilizer supply (11Barraclough P.B. J. Agric. Sci. 1986; 106: 45-52Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Soil also contains other forms of nitrogen, including ammonium and amino acids, and these may also be nitrogen sources available to plants (e.g. Ref. 12Schobert C. Komor E. Plant Cell Environ. 1987; 10: 493-500Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Nitrate uptake by plants has been shown to have biphasic kinetics, with different affinities for external nitrate; one uptake system hasK m values for nitrate in the micromolar range, and the other in the millimolar range (13Siddiqi M.Y. Glass A.D.M. Ruth T.J. Rufty Jr., T.W. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1990; 93: 1426-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these transporters show differing patterns of induction by nitrate, with two different high affinity systems, only one of which is nitrate-inducible; the other is constitutively expressed (14Wang R. Crawford N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9297-9301Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Examples of each type of gene have been cloned: a low affinity transport system (9Tsay Y.-F. Schroeder J.I. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 705-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and a high affinity transport system (15Trueman L.J. Richardson A. Forde B.G. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 175: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). After isolating a transporter gene, the best way to characterize the electrophysiological properties of the protein is to heterologously express the transporter in Xenopus oocytes. The advantage of this approach is that the activity of the transporter in the oocyte plasma membrane can then be assayed by measuring the nitrate-elicited current. In addition, in these experiments, the membrane voltage, a parameter that is usually variable in most uptake experiments, can be controlled. The control of membrane voltage is achieved by using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique on an oocyte that is expressing the transporter. A low affinity nitrate transporter fromArabidopsis has been cloned, and its K m for nitrate was determined when expressed in Xenopusoocytes. The K m for nitrate of the AtNRT1(formerly called CHL1) gene expressed in oocytes was measured as 8.5 mm at −60 mV, but the voltage dependence of this property was not determined (16Huang N.-C. Chiang C.-S. Crawford N.M. Tsay Y.-F. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This characterization was performed using oocytes in a mannitol-based external solution, in place of the more usual NaCl-based oocyte saline. This solution was chosen because AtNRT1 may also be able to transport chloride (17Schroeder J.I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 70-81Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and a nitrate-elicited current may be hidden in the background chloride current that would be present in a more typical saline. However, we have used a typical saline to demonstrate nitrate transporter activity in oocytes injected with BnNRT1;2 (alternative nameBnNRT1B) cRNA. Furthermore, we employed the activity of endogenous anion channels to demonstrate that oocytes expressing this related transporter from Brassica napus(BnNRT1;2) can accumulate nitrate, but not chloride. These results show that this low affinity nitrate transporter is able to transport several different nitrogen-containing molecules; however, the transport requires high external concentration of the substrate, suggesting that if present in root cells, it is most likely to function in uptake of nitrate from the soil when it is available at high concentrations. However, the production of mRNA for the transporter is induced in roots by treatment with only low external concentrations of nitrate. Oilseed rape seedlings (Brassica napus L. cv. Kentan nova) were grown hydroponically for 1 week and supplied with a nitrogen-free but otherwise complete nutrient solution at pH 6.5 (18Öhlen E. Ingemarsson B. Campbell W.H. Larsson C.-M. Planta (Heidelb.). 1995; 196: 485-491Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The plants were maintained in a growth chamber under a photon flux density of 200 μmol m−2 s−1(400–700 nm) with a diurnal light cycle of 16 h of light followed by 8 h of darkness. The temperature and humidity were kept at 25 °C and 80%, respectively. Total RNA from roots supplied with 25 mmKNO3 for 3 h was phenol/chloroform-extracted and purified according to Öhlen et al. (18Öhlen E. Ingemarsson B. Campbell W.H. Larsson C.-M. Planta (Heidelb.). 1995; 196: 485-491Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and subsequently used for preparing poly(A)+ RNA with oligo(dT)25-Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). The mRNA was converted to cDNA using a TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), ligated to dephosphorylated λgt10 arms, and in vitro packaged (Stratagene). Approximately 2.0 × 105 plaques from the unamplified λgt10 cDNA library were screened at medium hybridization stringency. The [32P]dCTP-labeled probe was prepared fromCHL1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. N. Crawford) using a DECAprime DNA labeling kit (Ambion Inc.). Positive clones of interest were subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene), amplified in XL1-Blue, and sequenced using the Sequenase II kit (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and synthetic oligonucleotide primers. For expression of the BnNRT1;2transporter in the Xenopus oocytes, the cDNA insert was excised from pBluescript, blunted, and inserted into theBglII site of the dephosphorylated Xenopusexpression vector pSP64T. This vector provides 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences from the Xenopus β-globin gene to any cDNA that provides its own initiation codon (19Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 20Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7057Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). The expression of BnNRT1;2 mRNA in roots was deduced by a ribonuclease protection assay (HybSpeed™ RPA, Ambion Inc.). A probe for the 3′-untranslated region was used to minimize cross-hybridization to related transcripts since cDNA cloning and Southern analyses indicated that there are several homologous genes in the rape genome. The RPA analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations using 25 μg of root total RNA and 3 × 104 cpm of the gel-purified riboprobe. All samples were normalized to 50 μg of RNA with yeast total RNA. The 388-base pair RNA probe was transcribed and labeled with [32P]UTP to high specific activity (MAXIscript, Ambion Inc.) after digestion of the plasmid with BpuA1. Digestion of the probe target mRNA was performed with RNase T only, as the 3′-untranslated region is rather AU-rich. RNA was extracted as described above, before as well as 1 and 6 h after the addition of 100 μmKNO3. A full-length cDNA for the B. napus gene BnNRT1;2 was constructed in aXenopus expression vector (pSP64T). The construct was linearized by digestion with BamHI, and cRNA was transcribed and capped using an SP6 mRNA mMachine™ in vitrotranscription kit (Ambion Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oocytes were removed and treated as described previously (21Zhou J.J. Theodoulou F.L. Sauer N. Sanders D. Miller A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Stage V or VI oocytes (22Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar) were chosen for injection with 50 nl of BnNRT1;2 cRNA (1 μg μl−1) or 50 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and were assayed for transporter activity 4–5 days after injection. Oocyte currents were measured using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method as described previously (21Zhou J.J. Theodoulou F.L. Sauer N. Sanders D. Miller A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A mannitol bath saline containing 0.15 mm CaCl2, 230 mmd-mannitol, and 10 mm HEPES was used to demonstrate the function of the nitrate transporterCHL1 (AtNRT1;1) from Arabidopsis inXenopus oocytes (9Tsay Y.-F. Schroeder J.I. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 705-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar); this solution was chosen because the transporter may have been able to transport chloride ions (17Schroeder J.I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 70-81Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We attempted to use this saline, but in control water-injected oocytes, we found that an inward current was elicited by the application of a range of different external salt solutions, the size of which depended on the concentration applied (data not shown). To avoid these background problems for all subsequent measurements, we decided to use a more usual frog saline containing 116 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Other details of the electrophysiology methods have been described previously (21Zhou J.J. Theodoulou F.L. Sauer N. Sanders D. Miller A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Each I-V curve was performed at the maximum steady-state current before, during, and after any treatments, and only in cases where identical before and after results were obtained were data used for further analysis. Substrate-elicited currents were obtained by subtracting the currents measured before addition from those obtained during the addition of substrate. Exposure to nitrate was for <1 min to minimize the accumulation of nitrate within the cell. At any given membrane potential, steady-state currents measured as a function of external substrate concentration were fitted to single Michaelis-Menten functions by a nonlinear least-squares method using SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany). These fits yielded the maximal currents (i max) and the half-maximal nitrate concentrations (K m ) (23Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 9-62Google Scholar). In all experiments, membrane potentials were allowed to adjust for at least 5 min after changing the external pH before any treatments were applied. To demonstrate the activity of BnNRT1;2 in driving the accumulation of nitrate inside oocytes, we took advantage of the presence of an already characterized endogenous anion channel activity in the oocyte plasma membrane. These anion channels are activated by transient clamping of the oocyte membrane voltage to values more negative than −150 mV and so are described as being hyperpolarization-activated with a selectivity sequence of I− > NO3− > Br− > Cl− (24Kowdley G.C. Ackerman S.J. John J.E., II Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By deliberately stimulating the opening of these channels in oocytes immersed in solutions containing either 120 mm nitrate or chloride and then measuring the associated tail currents, we could determine the internal concentrations of nitrate and chloride. For measurement of the reversal potentials, the membrane channel currents were activated by a 3-s prepulse voltage step to a range of different test voltages, from −150 to −200 mV, and then the voltage was clamped to values between −80 and +10 mV in 10-mV steps. The decay phases of the tail currents were fitted to an exponential function, and the extrapolated initial amplitudes were plotted as a function of tail potential. The interpolated xintercept of this plot was taken as the reversal potential (see Ref.24Kowdley G.C. Ackerman S.J. John J.E., II Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The internal nitrate concentrations were then estimated from the reversal potential (E) using the Nernst equation with 120 mm external nitrate. These measurements of internal nitrate were then checked by measuring the internal nitrate concentration of the oocytes with nitrate-selective microelectrodes. These electrodes were made and used as described previously (25Miller A.J. Methods Plant Cell Biol. 1996; 49A: 275-291Google Scholar). Five cRNA-injected oocytes and 12 water-injected oocytes were incubated in 1 ml of saline at pH 5.5 for 30 min at 20 °C, after which they were all transferred to 1 ml of saline containing 5 mm14C-labeled l-histidine (Amersham International) for a further 1 h at the same temperature. Uptake was then terminated by transferring the oocytes five times into 2-ml washes of ice-cold unlabeled saline. Finally, individual oocytes were transferred to plastic vials, each containing 0.2 ml of 5% (w/v) SDS, and then 4 ml of scintillation mixture (Packard Ultima Gold) was added. The radioactivity accumulated by each oocyte was measured on a Packard liquid scintillation analyzer (Model 2500TR). The screening of the λgt10 library demonstrated that cDNA homologous to theAtNRT1 cDNA (CHL1) was rather abundant; ∼10 positive plaques of 100,000 were obtained. Sequence analysis revealed that one of the cDNA clones (BnNRT1;2) (26Muldin I. Ingemarsson B. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 1341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) practically represented a full-length clone, 2.0 kilobase pairs in length. It contains an open reading frame corresponding to a 65-kDa protein consisting of 589 amino acids. By sequence comparisons,BnNRT1;2 was shown to be highly homologous toAtNRT1 both at the nucleotide level (85%) and at the level of deduced amino acid sequence. The protein corresponding to the 2.0-kilobase pair clone contains 12 hydrophobic amino acid segments. These putative membrane-spanning regions are separated into two groups, six in each, with a long putative cytoplasmic loop in the middle containing charged amino acids. The proposed topology of the protein is almost identical to the one predicted for AtNRT1(CHL1) (see Ref. 9Tsay Y.-F. Schroeder J.I. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 705-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and it retains the consensus motif (FYXXINXGSL) described for the protein family (7Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,8Steiner H.-Y. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid identity between BnNRT1;2and some other members of the family is shown in TableI. The comparison shows the most similarity to the Arabidopsis (9Tsay Y.-F. Schroeder J.I. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 705-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and tomato (10Lauter F.-R. Ninneman O. Bucher M. Riesmeier J.W. Frommer W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The identity comparison with other members of the family suggests that they are more distantly related, and they have all been shown to be peptide transporters (Table I).Table IComparison of the amino acid sequence identity of BnNRT1;2 to various mammalian and plant members of the PTR familyNameIdentity in the amino acid sequence toBnNRT1;2Substrate and source reference%AtNRT1(CHL1)96.9Nitrate transport (9Tsay Y.-F.

This result clearly demonstrates that the gene coding for this specific protein is highly nitrate-regulated. The same pattern, as seen here at 100 μm nitrate, can also be seen after the addition of 10 μm nitrate (data not shown), indicating that the sensitivity of the system for nitrate perception is very high. The steady-state currents of the transporter activity were measured as a function of membrane voltage and nitrate concentration in oocytes that had been previously injected with BnNRT1;2 cRNA. No nitrate-elicited currents for water-injected oocytes could be measured (data not shown). Fig.2 A shows theI-V difference curves obtained from a cRNA-injected oocyte on treatment with sodium nitrate ranging from 1 to 20 mm at pH o 5.5. The maximal currents varied between oocytes and were typically in the range 150–200 nA, although currents of up to 300 nA were recorded in some oocytes. Inward currents became larger at more negative membrane potentials and also increased as a function of nitrate concentration, saturating at 15 mmnitrate. A maximum current of −180 nA was measured in this experiment. These I-V difference curves could all be fitted to a Michaelis-Menten function; the fits for −100, −140, and −180 mV are shown in Fig. 2 B. The voltage dependence of the kinetic parameters obtained from the full set of fitted data is shown in Fig.3 (A and B). BothK m and i max are voltage-dependent; K m increased from 4 mm at −40 mV to 9 mm at −140 mV (Fig.3 A), and i max increased from −20 nA at −20 mV to −270 nA at −160 mV (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Voltage dependence of K m and i max for nitrate determined in saline at pH 5.5.

In saline containing 128 mm Cl−, the reversal potentials were −15.7 and −20.3 mV for BnNRT1;2- and water-injected oocytes, respectively (Table II). These values are not significantly different and are close to the oocyte chloride ion equilibrium potential (−18 mV), assuming an internal concentration of 62 mm (27Kusano K. Miledi R. Stinnakre J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 328: 143-170Crossref Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the internal chloride concentrations are not significantly different between cRNA- and water-injected oocytes. However, when external chloride was replaced by a similar concentration of nitrate, the reversal potentials were significantly different between BnNRT1;2- and water-injected oocytes: −18.8 mV for the former and −50.5 mV for the later (Table II). Using the Nernst equation, the estimated internal nitrate concentrations from the reversal potentials are 17 mm in water-injected oocytes and 57 mm nitrate in BnNRT1;2-injected oocytes (Table II). The oocytes were voltage-clamped at −50 mV when exposed to 120 mm nitrate before the tail current measurements. At this membrane potential, the oocytes could passively accumulate 17 mm nitrate, which is much lower than that estimated from the reversal potential in BnNRT1;2-injected oocytes. However, the resting potentials of oocytes prior to voltage clamping are also shown in Table II; from these, the equilibrium concentrations could also be calculated, and these are shown Table II. The measurements of internal nitrate were confirmed using nitrate-selective microelectrodes (Table II). The results in Table II show that cRNA-injected oocytes accumulate more nitrate than similar water-injected oocytes. However, in no case were the accumulations of nitrate large enough to demonstrate that active transport of nitrate is occurring (i.e. the measured accumulation was significantly larger than that predicted from the Nernst equation or equilibrium potential).Table IIReversal potentials (E v and E) of hyperpolarization-activated currents, resting potentials, and calculated and measured internal nitrate concentrations for water- and BnNRT1;2-injected oocytesParameterWater-injected oocyteBnNRT1;2 RNA-injected oocyteE v (mV)−20.3 ± 0.9 (4)−15.7 ± 2.1 (6)E (mV)−50.5 ± 6.4 (4)−18.8 ± 4.2 (6)Measured mean resting potential (mV)−42.2 ± 5.4 (4)−31.9 ± 5.6 (6)Calculated internal [NO3] (mm) fromE16.7 (13, 22)57 (49, 68)Theoretical nernstian internal [NO3] (mm)23 (19, 29)34.5 (28, 43)Measured internal [NO3] (mm)8 (3, 15) (4)41 (29, 55) (4) Open table in a new tab Although the gene was isolated by its sequence homology to a low affinity nitrate transporter, it belongs to a family of transporters that includes peptide and amino acid proton cotransporters, we tested other substrates in oocytes that had been injected with BnNRT1;2cRNA. These experiments showed that the oocytes showed larger currents when supplied with histidine than when treated with nitrate. However, several different substrates were tested, including other basic amino acids and anions. The results of these currents relative to the histidine currents for a range of different amino acids are shown in Table III. Only the basic amino acids lysine and arginine appeared to be transported; the other amino acids tested did not elicit significant currents in oocytes injected withBnNRT1;2 cRNA when compared with water-injected controls (Table III). Micromolar concentrations of ammonium did not elicit currents, and concentrations above 0.5 mm gave large currents in both cRNA- and water-injected oocytes. Also,d-histidine, free imidazole, and the dipeptide histidine-leucine failed to elicit significant current in cRNA-injected oocytes (data not shown). Other anions tested included nitrite, cyanate, and chlorate, all of which elicited small negative currents, which were not significantly different from those obtained in control water-injected oocytes. Fig.4 A shows the result of experiments in which cRNA-injected oocytes were incubated in radiolabeled l-histidine at pH o 5.5; these oocytes accumulated significantly more histidine. Fig. 4 B shows theI-V difference curve for the same cRNA-injected oocytes treated with l-histidine, nitrate, andl-histidine plus nitrate at pH o 5.5. TheI-V curve shows that 10 mml-histidine elicited a larger current than 10 mm nitrate, but when nitrate and l-histidine were applied at the same concentration in the same solution, the current obtained was the same size as that obtained with histidine alone.Table"

This is the first evidence that XA has induction activity. Species of Plasmodium, the parasitic protozoa that cause malaria, must undergo one sexual recombination in each transmission cycle. Although the mature sexual stages, or gametocytes, are present in the blood of infected vertebrate hosts, mating only occurs in the gut lumen of vector mosquitoes. This process of gametogenesis begins immediately after infected blood reaches the gut and is completed within about 20 min. During that brief time the parasite dissolves two erythrocyte membranes surrounding it and, in the case of the male gamete, completes a profound nuclear reorganization that results in the formation of several flagellar, free swimming gametes (1Sinden R.E. Butcher G.A. Billker O. Fleck S.L. Adv. Parasitol. 1996; 38: 53-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the signal that activates these dramatic events is in the mosquito gut (2Nijhout M.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1979; 48: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We recently confirmed the existence of such a signal and demonstrated that it is a heat stable chromophore of M r ≅ 205 (3Garcia G.E. Wirtz R.A. Rosenberg R. Mol. Biochem.

We report here the results of further chemical analyses that demonstrate that gamete activation factor (GAF) 1The abbreviations used are: GAF, gamete activation factor; XA, xanthuretic acid; KYNA, kynurenic acid; PBS, Dulbecco's physiological buffered saline (pH 7.4); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RP, reverse phase. is xanthurenic acid (XA), a tryptophan metabolite. Although XA is widely present in both vertebrates and invertebrates, this is the first evidence that it has inductive activity. It is likely this finding will play a part in the future development of drugs aimed at impeding the transmission of malaria, the most widespread and destructive parasitic disease in the world. Procedures for extracting and chromatographically purifying GAF from Anopheles stephensimosquito tissues have been described (3Garcia G.E. Wirtz R.A. Rosenberg R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this case GAF was prepared from 75,000 mixed male and female heads of A. stephensi(batch NP30); storage of the final extract was in water at −20 °C. High resolution electrospray interface mass spectrometry of GAF was performed at the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the National Center for Environmental Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA). Positive ion spectra were obtained from a Micromass 70–4F double focusing magnetic sector tandem mass spectrometer fitted with an electrospray interface. Solvent delivery was performed with HP1090 HPLC equipped with a HP diode array detector. A Vydac C18 column (1 × 150 mm, 90 Å, 5 μm) was used at a flow rate of 40 μl min−1. HPLC solvents used were water/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Buffer A) and acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Buffer B). Gradient elution was obtained by a hold at 1% Buffer B for 1 min and then a linear ramp from 1 to 13% Buffer B in 19 min followed by a linear ramp to 30% Buffer B in 5 min (for eluting leucine enkephalin time marker). The effluent was monitored at 205 nm. Wavelength scans (200–600 nm) were taken for all peaks eluting from the column. Initially, low resolution scans (1000 resolution at 10% valley) were performed over the m/z range of 100–600 atomic mass units. The high resolution scans were performed over a narrow mass range to bracket the major ion (m/z = 206) with two mass reference ions from PEG-200. The mass calibrant was injected post-column just prior to and just after elution of the 206 ion to negate the effect of ion drift on mass measurement. The analyses were done in triplicate. Potential elemental compositions were deduced employing the standard Micromass OPUS software, and candidate compounds were suggested from a search of National Institute of Standards and Technology software (1994–1995 edition) supplied with the OPUS system. UV spectra and retention time of XA were determined under identical conditions of reverse phase high performance chromatography as mosquito-derived GAF. The system employed consisted of a Vydac narrow bore column (2.1 mm × 25 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) attached to Beckman 126 pumps and a model 168 Diode Array Detector controlled by Beckman System Gold software (version 8.1). The compounds were eluted isocratically with a solvent of 5% CH3CN/94.9% H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1 and ambient temperature. XA (Sigma) concentrations were determined from the molar extinction coefficient (ε) at 247 nm. The ε247 was found by dissolving 0.54 μmol (0.11 mg) of XA in 1 ml (0.54 mm) of PBS (pH 7.4) and measuring the absorbance of the solution in a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer. The ε247 = 20,988 cm−1m−1. Concentrated solutions of XA were prepared in water and then adjusted to pH 7.4 with 0.5 n NaOH before addition of PBS. GAF concentrations were estimated from a standard curve of XA peak areas measured by RP-HPLC. Kynurenic acid (Sigma) stock solution was prepared by dissolving 0.12 mg (0.58 μmol) of the monohydrate form in 1 ml (0.58 mm) of PBS. Kynurenine (Sigma, 0.5 H2O mol/mol) 0.32 mg (1.5 μmol) was dissolved in 1 ml of PBS (1.5 mm). Kainic acid monohydrate (Sigma) 0.47 mg (2 μmol) was dissolved in 1 ml of PBS (2 mm). In vitro activity was determined usingP. gallinaceum, a bird malaria parasite, and culturedP. falciparum, a human parasite, as described previously (3Garcia G.E. Wirtz R.A. Rosenberg R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of test substances dissolved in PBS were added to preparations of gametocytes stored in PBS, which retards gametogenesis; induction is scored by microscopically counting the number of male gametes exflagellating 15–30 min later. We had previously determined that GAF has a major, singly charged ion species at m/z 206. Three runs of high resolution voltage scans were done of the bioactive fraction over a narrow range bracketing 206 (Table I). Results were highly consistent, and a median weight of 206.0450 was chosen to do an elemental composition search, with limits on the accuracy of the mass measurement set at 20 ppm. Only compounds containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur were searched; several elements with distinctive isotope distributions not evident in spectra (e.g.. chlorine, bromine, and copper) were excluded from consideration. The most likely composition, at an accuracy of 0.6 ppm, was C-10, H-8, N-1, O-4; assuming that the observed ion was [M+H]+, the most likely composition of the parent species was C-10, H-7, N-1, O-4. A search of the National Institute of Standards and Technology electron ionization libraries done for all entries with nominal weight of 205 yielded 292 candidate compounds; only those with the formula C-10, H-7, N-1, O-4 were chosen for further consideration. All but four candidates could be eliminated on the basis of having weights outside the 20 ppm limit, having rare atoms unlikely to be present (e.g. silicon or boron), or having atoms known to be absent (e.g. chlorine or bromine). The four compounds included 2-isobenzazol and three isomers of quinolinecarboxylic acid, one of which, XA, commonly occurs in insects (4Kayser H. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. 10. Pergamon Press, Oxford1985: 367-415Google Scholar).Table IHigh resolution mass measurements on GAFRun numberMeasured weightResolution1206.0451align=“center”50002206.045037003206.04503700 Open table in a new tab We found the chromatographic (Fig.1 A) and UV (Fig.1 B) characteristics of XA, or of a mixture of XA and GAF, to be identical to those of GAF. The ability of XA to stimulate gametogenesis in P. gallinaceum was comparable with that of GAF, with a threshold dose as low as 0.5 μm (TableII). XA and GAF at 1 mm also activated the human parasite P. falciparum at the same rates (73 and 51, respectively); XA concentrations as low as 325 nm induced prolific gametogenesis. A close analog of XA, kyneurenic acid, activated gametogenesis of P. gallinaceumbut at a maximum effect about one-third that of XA and with no induction below 100 μm (Table II). Two other products of tryptophan catabolism, kainic acid and kynurennine, had no bioactivity.Table IIThe ability of XA and KYNA to induce gametogenesis of the malaria parasite P. gallinaceum compared with that of the natural signal, GAFCompoundTest concentrations1 mm100 μm10 μm1 μm500 nm250 nm125 nm62 nmGAFND190ND261572-ap ≤ 0.01.>92-bp ≤ 0.05.>02-bp ≤ 0.05.>0XA2112-ap ≤ 0.01.2382-ap ≤ 0.01.2172-ap ≤ 0.01.2492-ap ≤ 0.01.10022120KYNA 81 6300NDNDNDND2-a p ≤ 0.01.2-b p ≤ 0.05. Open table in a new tab Gametocytes rarely constitute more than 5% of all infected red blood cells, and unlike the asexual forms, whose rapid cell division and growth force disintegration of the host erythrocyte independent of environmental cues, the gametocytes depend on an external signal to activate escape. The survival benefit to the parasite of this requirement is clear: only mating in the gut of the vector will ensure transmission to a new host. A reduction in temperature from 37 °C to less than 30 °C is a precondition for activation but does not alone induce gametogenesis (1Sinden R.E. Butcher G.A. Billker O. Fleck S.L. Adv. Parasitol. 1996; 38: 53-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that a single molecular species, GAF, present in both the gut and the head of a vector mosquito acts as a potent inducer of gametogenesis in a simple, protein-free, saline solution that otherwise would indefinitely prohibit activation (3Garcia G.E. Wirtz R.A. Rosenberg R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this report we present compelling analytical evidence that XA is GAF. The bioactivity of XA is confirmatory. XA is widely distributed in insects, where it is a byproduct of the 2,3-dioxygenase pathway of tryptophan degradation, which leads through kynurenine to, among other compounds, the ommochromes, common pigments of invertebrate eyes and integument (4Kayser H. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. 10. Pergamon Press, Oxford1985: 367-415Google Scholar). In vertebrates, XA has been routinely measured in urine as an indication of vitamin B6levels (5Liu M. Wang G.R. Liu T.Z. Tsai K.J. Clin. Chem. 1996; 42: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and has been linked indirectly to some pathological conditions, such as cataract formation (6Truscott R.J.W. Elderfield A.J. Clin. Sci. 1995; 89: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has not, however, been reported before to have inductive ability. How it induces gametogenesis is not yet known. Before gametogenesis begins, the parasite is separated from the erythrocyte cytoplasm by the host cell-derived parasitopherous vacuole membrane and from the external environment by the erythrocyte plasma membrane (7Aikawa M. Carter R. Ito Y. Nijhout M.M. J. Protozool. 1984; 31: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). There is evidence that gametogenesis is preceded by activation of the phosphoinositide cascade (8Ogwan'g R. Mwangi J. Gachihi G Nwachukwu A. Roberts C.R. Martin S.K Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and release of intracellular bound Ca2+ (9Kawamoto F. Fujioka H. Murakami R.I. Syafruddin Hagiwara M. Ishikawa T. Hidaka H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 60: 101-107PubMed Google Scholar). XA, which is relatively hydrophilic, may act as a ligand at the outer, erythrocyte membrane. Notably, KYNA, which differs structurally from XA only in the absence of a hydroxyl group from position 8, also stimulated gametogenesis, although at a substantially lower level. KYNA is now known to be an endogenous, nonspecific antagonist at the excitatory amino acid receptors in vertebrate central nervous systems, as well as having a high affinity for the glycine site in theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor complex (10Kessler M. Terramani T. Lynch G. Baudry M. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1319-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar); XA has been used as an inactive control in studies of KYNA kinetics. Presumably the mosquito head has proved to be a relatively rich source of GAF because of the metabolism of eye pigment, but it is not yet clear why XA is also present in its gut. Nor is the possible contribution of XA in vertebrate serum known; few data on serum levels have been published. Nevertheless, we now have a tool for investigating the precise sequence of gametogenesis induction. Considerable effort is now focused on developing vaccines targeted at the sexual stages in the gut, which would block malaria transmission (11Williamson K.C. Fujioka H. Aikawa M. Kaslow D.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and it seems likely that understanding the mechanics of induction will make possible a parallel effort to develop transmission blocking drugs. We appreciate the technical support provided by A. Laughinghouse and K. Lee (National Institutes of Health), V. Maggio (Centers for Disease Control), J. Glass and M. Dowler (Walter Reed Army Institute of Research), and C. Paul (Bethesda Research Institute). L. Tsai (National Institutes of Health) provided valuable advice."
https://openalex.org/W2019432938,"HIC-1 (hypermethylated in cancer) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene which is located at 17p13.3, a region which frequently undergoes allelic loss in breast and other human cancers. HIC-1 is proposed to be commonly inactivated in human cancers by hypermethylation of a normally unmethylated dense CpG island which encompasses the entire gene. To study whether HIC-1 inactivation may be important to the development of breast cancer, we first measured methylation of the HIC-1 gene in normal breast ductal tissues from microdissected frozen breast tissues and from epithelial cells purified from mammoplasty specimens. Surprisingly, in all normal breast ductal tissues we found approximately equal amounts of densely methylated HIC-1 and completely unmethylated HIC-1. This is in contrast to most normal tissues, in which all copies of HIC-1 are completely unmethylated. We then evaluated 39 primary breast cancer tissues and found virtually complete methylation of the HIC-1 gene in 26 (67%) of the cases. We also found loss of heterozygosity at the telomeric portion of chromosomal arm 17p in 22 of the 26 cases with strongly methylated HIC-1, suggesting that loss of an unmethylated HIC-1 allele may contribute to the inactivation of HIC-1 in cells with a pre-existing methylated allele. Finally, by RNase protection analysis, HIC-1 was found to be expressed in microdissected normal breast ductal tissues and unmethylated tumors but not in tumors with hypermethylation of the HIC-1 gene. These results indicate that hypermethylation of HIC-1 and associated loss of HIC-1 expression is common in primary breast cancer. Furthermore, the HIC-1 gene is densely methylated in approximately one-half of the alleles in normal breast epithelium, which may predispose this tissue to inactivation of this gene by loss of heterozygosity."

https://openalex.org/W2326148782,"The molecular mechanisms underlying Hodgkin's disease remain obscure, but it has been recognized that the neoplastic cells display high levels of constitutively active nuclear NF-κB. Here we demonstrate that although nuclear NF-κB is transcriptionally active, the Hodgkin cells fail to activate NF-κB dependent transcription in response to CD40 ligand. In three Hodgkin cell lines examined each had abnormalities in expression of IκBα which could account for the deregulated NF-κB. Although all three cell lines had greater than normal levels of IκBα mRNA no IκBα protein could be detected in the KM-H2 cells, while the L428 cell line contains a C-terminally truncated IκBα species that fails to associate with NF-κB. The HDLM-2 cell line contains a more slowly migrating form of IκBα that can associate with NF-κB, but increasing the level of this protein within the cell fails to inhibit nuclear NF-κB. Addition of recombinant IκBα to nuclear extracts from all three cell lines resulted in complete inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity and introduction of a plasmid expressing IκBα into the cells inhibited the transcriptional activity of an NF-κB dependent reporter plasmid. Thus the constitutive expression of NF-κB in Hodgkin cells is a direct consequence of the abnormal expression of IκBα rather than changes in NF-κB that render it refractory to inhibition by IκB proteins. These changes could, at least in part, account for the characteristic activated phenotype of Hodgkin cells and their pattern of cytokine secretion, which determine the pathological appearance and clinical manifestations of Hodgkin's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2054399091,"Data from mid-ocean ridge basalt glasses indicate that the short-lived radionuclide plutonium-244 that was present during an early stage of the development of the solar system is responsible for roughly 30 percent of the fissiogenic xenon excesses in the interior of Earth today. The rest of the fissiogenic xenon can be ascribed to the spontaneous fission of still live uranium-238. This result, in combination with the refined determination of xenon-129 excesses from extinct iodine-129, implies that the accretion of Earth was finished roughly 50 million to 70 million years after solar system formation and that the atmosphere was formed by mantle degassing."
https://openalex.org/W2395896744,"The transcription factor NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitory subunit IκB. Most extracellular signals activate NF-κB through a mechanism involving the phosphorylation and proteasome-dependent degradation of IκB. EGF activates NF-κB in A-431 carcinoma cells, which overexpress EGF receptors and in mouse embryo fibroblasts, which have a normal complement of receptors. Supershift experiments indicate that the NF-κB complexes induced by EGF are composed of p50/p50 homodimers and p65/p50 heterodimers, but not c-rel. EGF stimulation enhances the degradation of IκBα, but not IκBβ nor an N-terminal deletion mutant of IκBα. Treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor, such as ALLN or MG132, blocks EGF-mediated NF-κB activation, indicating that EGF-induced NF-κB activation requires proteasome-dependent IκB degradation. Also, Bapta A/M (a cell-permeable chelator of intracellular calcium) blocks EGF-induced NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation, suggesting a requirement of intracellular free Ca2+ for this growth factor response. Protein kinase C inhibition, in contrast, did not influence EGF activation of NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2065841267,"We recently found that overexpression of p185c-erbB2 in c-erbB2 transfected MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells (435.eB transfectants) confers a 5–9-fold increase in Taxol resistance. To examine whether Taxol resistance is a common phenomenon in other c-erbB2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, we tested a panel of human breast cancer cell lines established from different patients and expressing p185c-erbB2 at different levels for their sensitivity to Taxol and Taxotere, a synthetic taxoid. Higher expression of p185c-erbB2 in these breast cancer cell lines indeed correlated well with resistance to Taxol and Taxotere, and the degree of resistance was about 100-fold that in c-erbB2-overexpressing 435.eB transfectants, demonstrating that these breast cancer cells are highly resistant to Taxol. Since mdr-1-encoded p-glycoprotein (p170mdr-1) has been implicated in Taxol resistance, we next examined the p170mdr-1 levels in these breast cancer cell lines that are highly resistant to Taxol. Higher levels of p170mdr-1 expression were found in several breast cancer cell lines that are highly resistant to Taxol. Since these same breast cancer cell lines also expressed higher levels of p185c-erbB2, we sought to determine the relative contribution of p185c-erbB2 and p170mdr-1 overexpression to Taxol resistance. We first specifically down-regulated cell surface p185c-erbB2 using anti-p185c-erbB2 monoclonal antibodies and assayed sensitivity of these cells to Taxol. We next specifically inactivated p170mdr-1 function using p170mdr-1 blockers (thioridazine or verapamil) and again assayed Taxol sensitivity. Both p185c-erbB2 down-regulation and p170mdr-1 blockade significantly sensitized the breast cancer cell lines to Taxol. The results indicate that overexpression of either p185c-erbB2 or p170mdr-1 renders human breast cancer cells resistant to Taxol. Furthermore, p185c-erbB2 synergizes with p170mdr-1 conferring higher degrees of Taxol resistance. Finally, combination therapy (down-regulation of p185c-erbB2 plus blocking p170mdr-1 plus administration of Taxol) may be beneficial to breast cancer patients whose tumors express high levels of both p185c-erbB2 and p170mdr-1."
https://openalex.org/W2313258877,"The hepatitis B virus X protein plays an important role in the regulation of viral genome expression and has also been implicated in the development of liver cancer associated with chronic viral infection. Several effects have been attributed to X but their biological relevance remains elusive. One of the confusing issues has been so far the uncertaintys concerning its cellular location. To gain insight into the mechanism(s) how X exerts its effects, we have analysed its subcellular distribution and its dependency on the cell cycle. We used two complementary approaches namely, immunolocalization using a cell line stably expressing X, and characterization of the dynamics of X location in living cells by means of the reporter gene GFP. Our data clearly define the cytosol as the prime location of X, irrespectively of the cell cycle and show in addition the close attachment of a fraction of X to the nuclear membrane. However, X does not associate with any cytoplasmic vesicles and organelles so far tested. In contrast, our study provides strong evidence for the codistribution of X with the cytosolic fraction of proteasomes. In pulse-chase experiments, X decayed with a half-life of less than 30 min and proteasome-inhibitors did not modify its turnover, suggesting that X colocalization with the proteasome does not simply point to its degradation pathway. The proteolytic processing of the p105 precursor of the p50 subunit of the NF-κB transcription factor, which has been shown to be proteasome-dependent, is markedly slow down in the presence of X. These findings suggest that X modulates the processing rate of p105 by acting presumably at the level of the proteasome. Thus, targeting of proteasomes by X might be one of the pathways employed by this viral protein to subvert cellular functions."

https://openalex.org/W2328599562,"The Ets family of transcription factors comprises several members which are involved to regulate gene transcription. Although several consensus binding sites for Ets proteins can be found in a wide series of promoter, only a limited number of them are indeed activated by these transcription factors. The human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) plays a crucial role in immune responses by enabling the binding of effector cells to various target cell types. ICAM-1 is constitutively expressed at different levels in the absence of stimuli in different cell types, and its expression is upregulated by several proinflammatory cytokines. We have here examined the transcriptional regulation of human ICAM-1 expression by Ets proteins, and more particularly by ERM, a member of this family of transcription factors. Transient transfection assays revealed that Ets-2 and ERM significantly activate the transcription of ICAM-1 promoter, whereas the less-related Ets family member, Spi-1/Pu.1, failed to do so. Transfection of a series of ICAM-1 promoter deletion mutants together with ERM expression plasmids have shown that an Ets responsive element is located within the first 176 bp upstream from the translational start site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting analysis have enabled us to identify two Ets binding sites at positions -158 and -138 from the ATG, respectively. Site directed mutagenesis of these elements has shown that the distal site is the major element required for the ERM-mediated activation of the ICAM-1 promoter. We can thus conclude that expression of ICAM-1 can be regulated by Ets transcription factors."

Nodulation genes (nod, nol, andnoe) of the symbiotic soil bacteria Azorhizobium,Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, andRhizobium (collectively termed rhizobia), may be divided into two classes. One class comprises genes which, when mutated, completely abolish nodulation on all legumes. Since genes in this group share significant sequence homology and can be complemented between different rhizobial genera/species, they are often called “common.”nodABCIJ and nodD are the best known examples. Genes of the second class are necessary for the interaction with certain, but not all, legumes. Expression of these genes permits nodulation of additional hosts, and for this reason, they have been termed host specificity ofnodulation (= hsn) genes. By definition, they are unique to one or a few rhizobia. In 1990, Lerouge et al. (1Lerouge P. Roche P. Faucher C. Maillet F. Truchet G. Promé J.-C. Dénarié J.

Principal differences among the Nod factors of the various rhizobia concern the length of the core molecule as well as the substitutions to both the reducing and nonreducing residues. Presumably, the hsn genes are responsible for these substitutions. With the discovery of Nod factors, it became possible to correlatenod gene expression with Nod factor structure. In their pioneering studies, Roche et al. (6Roche P. Debellé F. Maillet F. Lerouge P. Faucher C. Truchet G. Dénarié J. Promé J.-C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1131-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) demonstrated that thehsn loci, nodH and nodPQ, are responsible for the 6-O-sulfation of the reducingN-acetyl-d-glucosamine of NodRm factors. Later work has shown that the first step in Nod factor assembly is performed by an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase coded bynodC (7Geremia R.A. Mergaert P. Geelen D. van Montagu M. Holsters M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Then, a deacetylase coded by nodBremoves the N-acetyl moiety from the nonreducing end of theN-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharides (8John M. Röhrig H. Schmidt J. Wieneke U. Schell J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Finally, an acyltransferase coded by nodA, links the acyl chain to the NH2-free carbon C-2 of the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide (9Röhrig H. Schmidt J. Wieneke U. Kondrorosi E. Barlier I. Schell J. John M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3122-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). NodI and NodJ are involved in the export of Nod factors (10Spaink H.P. Wijfjes A.H.M.

NGR234, three Hsn loci were discovered by transferring cosmids covering the symbiotic plasmid to heterologous rhizobia (i.e. rhizobia unable to nodulate NGR234 hosts), and asking if the transconjugants could form nodules on Vigna unguiculata (12Broughton W.J.

In this way, we showed that HsnII, which is responsible for the host-specific nodulation of Leucaenaspecies, contains nodSU (14Lewin A. Cervantes E. Wong C.-H. Broughton W.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1990; 3: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which are involved inN-methylation and 6-O-carbamoylation of NodNGR factors, respectively (15Jabbouri S. Fellay R.

HsnI contains five genes encoding a set of enzymes responsible for the synthesis GDP-fucose and its transfer by NodZ to NodNGR factors (16Quesada-Vincens D. Fellay R. Nassim T. Viprey V. Burger U.

Dénarié J. Broughton W.J. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1987; 8: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this, as in much of the work discussed above, we used the closely related R. fredii strain USDA257 because (a) it nodulates an exact subset of the NGR234 hosts; (b) many of the nod genes, and most of the essential, chromosomal genes, are extremely well conserved between the two strains (18Krishnan H.B. Lewin A. Fellay R. Broughton W.J. Pueppke Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3321-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Perret X. Fellay R. Bjourson A.J. Cooper J.E. Brenner S. Broughton W.J.

Combined, these properties facilitate extension of host-range studies in which NGR234 clones are introduced into USDA257 on broad host range, multiple copy plasmids. Since the nodulation requirements of the two bacteria are known, the initial screening for particular hosts can be performed on legumes that are nodulated by NGR234 but not by USDA257. These analyses show that HsnIII is downstream of nodABC, and includes the nodIJnolOnoeI genes. NoeI is required for 2-O-methylation of the fucose and NolO for 3-O(or 4-O)-carbamoylation of the nonreducing terminus of NodNGR factors.

Concomitantly, the SpR Omega fragment was excised from pHP45 withBamHI or EcoRI and ligated onto the linear p6.8HR fragments. After transformation intoEscherichia coli XL.1 Blue, the plasmids were conjugated into a RifR derivative of NGR234 with the help of plasmid pRK2013. RifRSpRTcS colonies were checked for homologous recombination by Southern transfer. A 2.6-kbEcoRI fragment of pNG77 carrying noeI was first cloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK. The resulting construct, pSK2.6E contains a unique StuI site that is located 26-pb downstream of the start codon (ATG) of noeI. Digestion of pSK2.6E with StuI permitted introduction of the SpR Omega interposon (which was extracted from pHP45Ω by digestion with SmaI) into the noeI gene (25Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst .). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Finally, the entire noeI-Omega cassette was cloned into theXbaI and SalI sites of the suicide vector pJQ200sk (26Quandt J. Hynes M.F. Gene (Amst .). 1993; 127: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Triparental matings (including the helper plasmid pRK2013) were used to mobilize noeI-Omega into NGR234. Selection of NGRΩnoeI was performed as described previously (27Hanin M. Jabbouri S. Quesada-Vincens D. Broughton W.J. Fellay F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The 2.2-kbHindIII/BamHI fragment downstream ofnodABCIJ, which contains nolO, was cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pBluescript KS (giving pKS2.2B/H). Digestion of pBluescript KS with BamHI and HindIII led to deletion of the EcoRI site in the multiple-cloning site. Consequently, an EcoRI fragment carrying the KmR Omega interposon (25Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst .). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar) could be cloned into the EcoRI site of nolO. The cassette containingnolO::Ω was then cloned into XbaI andXhoI sites of pJQ200sk. Finally, the recombinant plasmid was transferred to two distinct nodU mutants: NGRΩ26 and NGRΔ1 that are a SpR insertion mutant (innodU) and a deletion mutant (nodSU) of NGR234, respectively (14Lewin A. Cervantes E. Wong C.-H. Broughton W.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1990; 3: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).

After alditol acetate derivatization, analyses of monosaccharides originating from the LCOs were performed by GC/MS (using an electron impact ion source) after separation on a 15-cm SupelcoTM SP fused silica column (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). The synthesis and analysis of monoacetylated glucosamines by MS/MS was performed as described in Ferro et al. 2M. Ferro, M. Treilhou, S. Jabbouri, W. J. Broughton, C. Monteiro, and J.-C. Promé, manuscript submitted for publication. At the outset, large fragments (≅40 kb) of the symbiotic plasmid of Rhizobium sp. NGR234 (pNGR234a) were cloned into the nontransmissible cosmid vector pJB8 (22Broughton W.J. Heycke N. Meyer z.A.H. Pankhurst C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 169-176Crossref Google Scholar). Individual cosmids were mobilized into heterologous rhizobia by introducing the cis-acting DNA recognition site for conjugative DNA transfer (Mob site) of RP4 into the clones. This was accomplished by conjugating the Tn5-Mob vector pSUP5011 (31Simon R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 96: 413-420Google Scholar) into E. coli strains containing the pJB8 cosmids. Matings with another RP4 derivative permitted mobilization of the cosmids into variousAgrobacterium/Rhizobium strains includingRhizobium loti strain NZP4010. R. loti (pWA54) transconjugants nodulated V. unguiculata at low frequency, and this locus was named HsnIII (12Broughton W.J. Wong C.-H. Lewin A. Samrey U. Myint H. Meyer z.A.H. Dowling D.N. Simon R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Preliminary mapping showed that pWA54 partially overlaps with pWA46, but that the latter does not confer host-range extension on the transconjugants (13Lewin A. Rosenberg C. Meyer z.A.H. Wong C.-H. Nelson L. Manen J.-F. Stanley J. Dowling D.N. Dénarié J. Broughton W.J. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1987; 8: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To search for a cosmid which would give a higher frequency of Nod+ transconjugants, a new clone bank was established in the broad host-range, transmissible, cosmid vector pRK7813 (32Stanley J. Dowling D.N. Stucker M. Broughton W.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 48: 25-30Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Triparental matings were used to mobilize the individual pRK7813 cosmids into R. fredii strain USDA257. One clone (pNG77) was identified that shared homology with pWA54 and permitted USDA257 to nodulate C. caeruleum. Among the legumes tested, pNG77 extended the host range to Calopogonium and L. purpureus but had no effect on nodulation of the other plants (Table II).Table IIPhenotypes of Rhizobium sp.

Open table in a new tab Examination of the nodulation capacity of R. frediitransconjugants harboring either HsnII (=nodSU, contained on pA18) or HsnIII (carried on pNG77), clearly demonstrated that these are proper hsn loci. The nodSU genes permit nodulation of Leucaena leucocephala (but notCalopogonium and Lablab), while the reverse is true for HsnIII (Table II). A series of subclones in pRK7813 were generated and mobilized into USDA257. The resulting transconjugants were used to inoculate Calopogonium,Lablab, and other legumes. Interestingly, the 7.6-kbEcoRI fragment of pNG77, which contains regions on either side of nodABC, was unable to extend the host range (TableII). On the other hand, clones containing the right most of two 6.8-kbHindIII fragments (p6.8HR) (Fig.1), conferred the ability to nodulate both C. caeruleum and L. purpureus on the transconjugants. These data suggest that the HsnIII locus lies at the end of p6.8HR distal to nodABC. Surprisingly, when the transconjugants were reisolated fromCalopogonium nodules, they had lost resistance to tetracycline (i.e. they were KmRTcS), but retained their ability to nodulateCalopogonium. DNA isolated from nodules induced by USDA257(pNG77), and hybridized against an internal nodCprobe of NGR234, showed that the restriction pattern of the USDA257nodC locus in the re-isolates had changed to that of NGR234. 3B. Relić, unpublished results. Similar KmRTcS reisolates were obtained from nodules induced by USDA257(p6.8HR) transconjugants. Interestingly, the restriction pattern of the USDA257(p6.8HR)nodC locus was identical to that obtained from USDA257(pNG77) transconjugants, suggesting that the commonnod genes play a role in homologous recombination between the two species. R. fredii (pNG77) or R. fredii(p6.8HR) reisolates from C. caeruleum nodules were stable as judged by their ability to nodulate bothCalopogonium and Lablab when reinoculated onto them (Table II). As R. fredii transconjugants harboring p7.6E and p2.2B/H (Fig. 1) were unable to nodulate C. caeruleum while those containing p6.8HR were able to do so (Table II), the HsnIII locus is most probably located in the region of overlap between p7.6E and p2.2B/H. To delimit possible genes in this region, we sequenced the plasmids represented by p7.6E and p2.8HR. As confirmed by complete sequencing of pNGR234a (33Freiberg C. Fellay R. Bairoch A. Broughton W.J. Rosenthal A. Perret X. Nature. 1997; 387: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), seven open reading frames are contained in this locus (Fig. 1). A noncoding sequence of 173 bp separates nodABC from the 1,005-bp nodI. After a gap of only 3 bp, this is followed by another ORF of 789 bp that is highly similar to nodJ. nolO is downstream ofnodJ and is followed by part of noeI. Insertion of an Omega cassette into either nodI or nolO ornoeI had no effect on the capacity of the mutant to form nodules (Table II). RNA competition/hybridization experiments were used to see whether the loci contained on pNG77 and p6.8HR were inducible by flavonoids. One h after exposure to apigenin, all of the fragments contained on p6.8HR (e.g. the 1.7- and the 3.6-kbBamHI fragments) as well as the 7.6-kb EcoRI fragment of pNG77 hybridized, showing that the entire locus is inducible (data not shown). Although these data do not constitute proof, they suggest that nodABCIJnolOnoeI are transcribed as one operon. Thin layer chromatographic analyses of the supernatants from [14C]glucosamine-fed cultures of NGRΩnodI, NGRΩnolO, and NGRΩnoeIdid not reveal differences from the wild-type bacterium (data not shown). We were thus able to exclude a role for these genes in fucosylation or sulfation of NodNGR factors. Other possible roles of the hsnIII genes were studied by subjecting partially purified (i.e. eluted from a C18-reverse-phase column) Nod factors to acidic methanolysis. Hydrophilic compounds were separated from the hydrophobic components by hexane extraction. GC/MS analyses of the methyl-esterified hexane-fraction did not reveal any changes in the N-linked acyl chain attached to the nonreducing terminus. This way, we were able to rule out any affect of the hsnIII genes on fatty acid synthesis. In another approach (and after alditol-acetate derivatization), the monosaccharide compositions of the mutants were compared with those produced by the wild-type bacterium. Interestingly, the peak corresponding to 2-O-methyfucose was absent in Nod factors produced by all three mutants, while those corresponding to fucose,N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), andN-methylglucosamine (MeGlcN) were present (see Fig. 3). This indicates that one o"

IFN-α added in media before mid-G1 prohibited cells from entering S phase. The blockage of G1/S transition was associated with diminuition of both cyclin D1/cdk4- and cyclin E/cdk2-associated kinase activities. G1 cyclin-associated kinase activities were down-regulated quickly after the addition of IFN-α. Cells treated with IFN-α contained excess amounts of cdk inhibitors which down-regulated G1 cyclin/cdk-associated kinase activities in the proliferating cells and this action was counteracted by exogenously-supplied recombinant cyclin D2/cdk4 complexes. In parallel, accumulation of p19Ink4D and p21Cip1, and their attachment to cdks were up-regulated quickly after the addition of IFN-α. Expression of p19Ink4D and p21Cip1 was potentiated transcriptionally. We concluded that increased attachment of upregulated cdk inhibitors including p19Ink4D and p21Cip1 to G1 cyclin/cdk complexes contributed to diminuition of G1 cyclin/cdk-associated kinase activities and resulting G1 phase arrest during the early phase of treatment with IFN-α."
https://openalex.org/W2002324983,"Numerical modeling of the orbital evolution of interplanetary dust particles revealed that, over the past 1.2 million years, the rate of accretion of dust by Earth has varied by a factor of 2 to 3. These variations display a 100,000-year periodicity and are anticorrelated with Earth's changing orbital eccentricity. Extraterrestrial helium-3 concentrations in a deep-sea sediment core display a similar periodicity but are 50,000 years out of phase with the predicted variations. Also, because collisions between large bodies in the asteroid belt are inevitable, it is expected that large-amplitude stochastic variations on 10(7)- to 10(8)-year time scales would be superimposed on the 10(5)-year periodic variations."
https://openalex.org/W2054709003,"The potential role of the cytoskeleton in signaling via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) was investigated using pharmacological agents. In Jurkat T cells, disruption of the actin-based cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D or disruption of the microtubules with colchicine did not affect TCR induction of proximal signaling events triggered by CD3 mAb. Polymerized actin and tubulin, therefore, were not required for TCR-mediated signal transduction. Nocodazole, however, was found to inhibit dramatically TCR signaling, independently of its ability to depolymerize microtubules. This effect was TCR-specific, because signaling via the human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 in the same cells was unaffected. A mechanism for the inhibition of TCR signaling by nocodazole was suggested by<i>in vitro</i> assays, which revealed that the drug inhibited the kinase activity of LCK and, to a lesser extent, FYN. The kinase activity of ZAP-70 <i>in vitro</i>, however, was unaffected. These results, therefore, suggested that nocodazole prevented initial phosphorylation of the TCR by LCK after stimulation, and as a result, it blocked activation of downstream signaling pathways. Immunofluorescence analyses also revealed that nocodazole and the specific SRC-family kinase inhibitor PP1 delocalized ZAP-70 from its constitutive site at the cell cortex. These effects did not require the SH2 domains of ZAP-70. The localization of ZAP-70 to the cell cortex is, therefore, regulated by the activity of SRC-family kinases, independently of their ability to phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of the TCR."

(1991) FEBS Lett. 291, 331–335). An improved purification method increased the yield of the protein and allowed more detailed investigations. Its molecular mass and heme content have been found to be 64,210 Da and 1 mol of heme/mol of protein, respectively. It is only detectable in cells grown at low oxygen tensions. The composition of the growth medium also exerts significant influence on the cytochromeb 558/566 content of S. acidocaldarius membranes. The cytochrome exhibits an extremely high redox potential of +400 mV and shows no CO reactivity; a ligation other than a His/His-coordination of axial ligands appears likely. It turned out to be highly glycosylated (more than 20% of its molecular mass are sugar residues) and is probably exposed to the outer surface of the plasma membrane. The sugar moiety consists of severalO-glycosidically linked mannoses and at least oneN-glycosidically linked hexasaccharide comprising two glucoses, two mannoses, and two N-acetyl-glucosamines. The gene of the cytochrome (cbsA) has been sequenced, revealing an interesting predicted secondary structure with two putative α-helical membrane anchors flanking the majority of a mainly β-pleated sheet structure containing unusually high amounts of serine and threonine. A second gene (cbsB) was found to be cotranscribed. The latter displays extreme hydrophobicity and is thought to form a functional unit with cytochromeb 558/566 in vivo, although it did not copurify with the latter.

A cytochromec analogous function in the pseudoperiplasmic space ofS. acidocaldarius is discussed. Sulfolobus acidocaldarius has been described as an obligate aerobic, facultatively chemolithoautotrophic, hyperthermoacidophilic archaeon growing at 75–80 °C and pH 2–2.5 (1Brock T.D. Brock K.M. Belly R.T. Weiss R.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1972; 84: 54-68Google Scholar). However, it grows much faster under heterotrophic conditions. Its respiratory chain consists of at least one succinate dehydrogenase (2Janssen S. Schäfer G. Anemüller S. Moll R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5560-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,3Moll R. Schäfer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), two Rieske proteins (4Schmidt C.L. Anemüller S. Schäfer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and two terminal oxidases (5Lübben M. Arnaud S. Castresana J. Warne A. Albracht S.P. Saraste M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6Schäfer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 163-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). InS. acidocaldarius membranes, three differenta-type and two different b-type but noc-type cytochromes can be detected. Most cytochromes can be attributed to either one of the two oxidase complexes. Cytochromea 587 (SoxC) and cytochromeaa 3 (SoxB) are part of the SoxABCD quinol oxidase (7Gleißner M. Kaiser U. Antonopoulos E. Schäfer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8417-8426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Lübben M. Kolmerer B. Saraste M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas a second cytochrome a 587(SoxG) and a cytochrome b 562 (SoxM) are constituents of the SoxM terminal oxidase complex (9Castresana J. Lübben M. Saraste M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, a second b-type cytochrome cannot be attributed to any of these complexes. Previously (10Becker M. Schäfer G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), cytochromeb 558/566, named after its absorption maxima in the redox difference spectrum, was thought to participate in terminal electron transport due to its positive redox potential of >300 mV, its putative heme and copper content, and the CO difference spectrum typical for an o-type cytochrome obtained with partially purified membrane solubilisates. Because the function of this membrane-residing cytochrome remained obscure and could not be attributed to redox systems of respiratory electron transport, a genetic approach toward its further characterization was taken. In this report, we present an improved purification method providing high yields of this unusual cytochrome for a fundamentally revised spectroscopic and protein-chemical characterization. Cytochromeb 558/566 is shown to be highly glycosylated, and the first results of its glycosylation pattern are reported. In addition, an operon has been identified and sequenced encoding this interesting and novel hemoprotein; the transcription pattern is described. From the primary sequence, we concluded that in contrast to previous speculations, this cytochrome has no function as part of a terminal oxidase. A function as an ectoenzyme participating in periplasmic metabolism is discussed on the basis of its significant up- and down-regulation by modifying the growth conditions of theSulfolobus cells. S. acidocaldarius cells (DSM 639) were grown heterotrophically in a mineral salt medium at 78 °C and at pH 2.5 in a 50-liter fermenter as described previously (11Anemüller S. Schäfer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To establish oxygen-limiting conditions throughout cell growth, aeration was started with a 12 liter/h airflow and was increased in a step-wise manner up to 35 liters/h in parallel to the increasing cell density. Escherichia coli XL2-blue (Stratagene) was grown at 37 °C in LB medium (12Sambrook S. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 μg of ampicillin/ml. The plasmid pBluescript II SK− was purchased from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany), and pSP64 was purchased from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). S. acidocaldarius cells were harvested in the late logarithmic phase at an optical density of 1.4–1.5 by continuous flow separation using a Westfalia separator. The cells were resuspended in 50 mm Mes, 1The abbreviations used are: Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; AS, ammonium sulfate; DM, n-dodecyl-β-maltoside; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; SB-12,N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-ammonio-3-propane-sulfonate; GLC, gas liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; kb, kilobase(s). 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.5; centrifuged at 7800 × g; resuspended in the same buffer; frozen in liquid nitrogen; and stored at −70 °C. Typical yields were 2.4–3 g of wet cell material per liter of culture medium. Cells were disrupted in a Manton-Gaulin press, and membranes were prepared as described previously (11Anemüller S. Schäfer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For chaotropic preextraction, the membranes were diluted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 30 mmsodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.5. After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the suspension was centrifuged (120,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C). The membrane pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, and AS was added to a final concentration of 500 mm. DM was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the solution was centrifuged (as above) to remove insoluble components. The following steps were performed at 4 °C. A saturated solution of AS was slowly added to the supernatant to achieve 50% saturation. This solution was applied to a propyl-agarose column (Sigma P-5268; 1.5 cm in diameter, 16 cm in length) equilibrated with 50% saturated AS, 1 mm DM, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, at 0.5 ml/min. Subsequently, the column was washed with 120 ml of the same buffer. Elution was performed by a step-wise decrease in AS concentration and by a change in detergent (step 1: 40% AS saturation, 0.2 mm DM, 150 ml; step 2: 40% AS saturation, 0.5% SB-12, 120 ml; step 3: 20% AS saturation, 0.2 mm DM, 120 ml; all solutions with 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3). A minor fraction of the cytochrome b 558/566 eluted at step 1 with large amounts of contaminating proteins. The major part eluted at step 2 in a much purer form. Fractions from step 2 were collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration on a PM-30 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA) to 3–5 ml. The concentrated cytochrome fraction was further purified by gel filtration (50 mm Tris/HCl, 0.5 mm DM; flow, 1 ml/min; Highload Superdex 200, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Elution was monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm and 430 nm. Fractions containing the cytochromeb 558/566 were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (as above). Further contaminating proteins were removed by digestion with trypsin (about 1 mg of trypsin/10 mg of protein) and another gel filtration step (as above). If the cytochrome preparations were to be used for sugar analyses other than the chemical deglycosylation procedure (see below), both gel filtrations were carried out with 0.5% SB-12 instead of DM. Protein concentrations were determined by the modified Lowry method in the presence of detergents (13Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7066) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard or with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Heme b concentrations were determined as pyridine hemochromogen according to standard methods (14Williams J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 107: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), using a molar extinction coefficient of ε = 22,100m−1cm−1. Absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature using a HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer or at liquid nitrogen temperature using a SIGMA ZWS-II dual wavelength spectrophotometer equipped with a laboratory-designed low temperature device as described in Ref. 15Schäfer G. Anemüller S. Moll R. Gleißner M. Schmidt C.L. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 16: 544-555Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar. Spectro-electrochemical determination of the redox potential was performed essentially according to Ref. 16Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar using a laboratory-designed multireflection titration cell in conjugation with the quartz fiber optics of a DW-2 spectrophotometer (15Schäfer G. Anemüller S. Moll R. Gleißner M. Schmidt C.L. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 16: 544-555Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were recorded with an X-band Bruker ER 200 D-SRC spectrometer equipped with an ESR 910 continuous flow helium cryostat from Oxford instruments. Copper content was determined using a Hitachi 180-80 Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer set at 324.8 nm. For the measurement of the the iron content, the spectrophotometer was set at 248.3 nm. GLC was performed on a Varian 3700 chromatograph (Varian) equipped with a fused-silica gel SPB-5 column using a temperature gradient of 150 °C (3 min) → 320 °C at 5 °C/min. GLC-MS was performed on a HP 5989A instrument (Hewlett-Packard) equipped with an HP-5 column under the same chromatographic conditions as for GLC. MALDI-MS was performed with a Bruker-Reflex II (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) instrument in the positive linear time of flight mode at an acceleration voltage of 28.5 kV. Samples were dispersed in TA (0.1% CF3COOH-acetonitrile, 2:1 by volume) in a concentration of approximately 1 μg/ml. Part of this mixture (1 μl) was added to 15 μl of matrix solution (saturated sinapic acid (Aldrich) in TA). Aliquots of 0.5 μl were deposited on a metallic sample holder and analyzed immediately after drying in a stream of air. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was carried out in the presence of SDS (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar) using a 15% acrylamide gel with 1% bisacrylamide as cross-linker. Cyanogen bromide-cleaved fragments (see below) of the cytochrome b 558/566 were separated by electrophoresis according to the method described by Schägger and von Jagow (18Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar) using a 16.5% separating gel, a 10% spacer gel, and a 4% stacking gel, all with 3% bisacrylamide as cross-linker. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Glycoprotein staining was performed as described in Ref. 19Wardi A.H. Michos G.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar. Polyacrylamide gels were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 40 mA for 1–2 h with an electroblot apparatus (Semi-Phor, Hoefer Scientific Instruments) using 50 mm sodium borate, 0.02% SDS, 10% methanol, pH 9.0, as a transfer buffer. Isoelectric focusing was carried out using 8% acrylamide gels with 3% cross-linker containing 4% ampholytes and 17% glycerol. Ampholytes (Servalyt AG 3-10, Servalyt AG 4-6, and Servalyt T 2-4) were purchased from Serva. Chemical deglycosylation was performed using a commercially available kit (K-500, Oxford GlycoSystems, Abingdon, United Kingdom) that cleaves both O- and N-linked sugar residues by the use of trifluoromethane sulfonic acid. For total sugar analysis, purified cytochromeb 558/566 (1 mg) was hydrolysed in 1 ml of 2m CF3COOH (100 °C for 4 h), reduced (NaBH4), per-O-acetylated (acetanhydride in pyridine, 1:1.5, v/v, 85 °C for 20 min), and analyzed by GLC and GLC-MS (20Sawardeker J.S. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A. Anal. Chem. 1965; 37: 1602-1603Crossref Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). O-linked sugars were liberated by β-elimination from cytochrome b 558/566 (1 mg) with 2 mNaBH4 in 0.1 m NaOH (45 °C for 16 h) (21Lee Y.C. Rice K.G. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 127-163Google Scholar). The mixture was neutralized, per-O-acetylated, and analyzed by GLC-MS. A third aliquot (1 mg) was used to determine N-linked sugars by heating with hydrazine (1 ml) in a sealed tube (100 °C for 12 h). After the reagent was evaporated under reduced pressure, sugars were N-acetylated (1 ml of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and 15 μl of acetic acid anhydride for 30 min). The N-acetylation was repeated twice. After neutralization with ion exchanger (IR 120, H+ form), the crude oligosaccharide preparation was purified using a gel permeation chromatography column (2 × 112 cm, Sephadex G-10) in water monitoring the eluate at 206 nm (Uvicord, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligosaccharide fractions were combined and lyophilized. One aliquot (110) of the oligosaccharide was analyzed for its components by GLC-MS analysis described above. Purified samples of either intact cytochromeb 558/566 or of deglycosylated cytochrome (about 20–50 μg) were cleaved by 0.75 m cyanogen bromide in 75% formic acid in a final volume of 400 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, diluted by addition of 400 μl of distilled water, frozen at −70 °C, and dried in a Speed Vac concentrator. The dried samples were resuspended in distilled water, and the evaporation was repeated. Finally, samples were resuspended in 20 μl of water. The fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Bands were cut out, and the amino acid sequence was determined by automated microscale Edman degradation. All general cloning procedures were performed according to standard methods (12Sambrook S. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA of S. acidocaldarius was prepared according to the method of Marmur (22Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (8945) Google Scholar), and plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli cells on a small scale by lysis with lysozym and Triton X-100 (23Holmes D.S. Quigley M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar) or on a large scale by anion exchange chromatography (Jetstar, Genomed, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany). All nonradioactive labeling, blotting, hybridization, and chemiluminescence detection techniques were performed as described in detail in Ref. 24Purschke W.G. Schmidt C.L. Petersen A. Schäfer G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 179: 1344-1353Crossref Google Scholar. The longest amino acid sequence obtained (MYEVDTAGIYYTPVAA) was chosen to derive two oligonucleotide probes (probe 1, 5′-CCWGCWGT-RTCWACYTCRTACAT-3′; probe 2, 5′-ATATAYTAYACWCCWGTWGC-WGC-3′). The oligonucleotides were 3′-end-labeled with digoxygenin-11-ddUTP (24Purschke W.G. Schmidt C.L. Petersen A. Schäfer G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 179: 1344-1353Crossref Google Scholar). S. acidocaldarius genomic DNA was digested with various restriction enzymes, separated on agarose gels, and blotted by vacuum onto nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 2.8-kbPstI/XbaI fragment positive with probe 1 was chosen for insertion into pSP64 and cloning in E. coliXL2-blue (plasmid pCBS1). Transformation into E. coli cells was performed as described in Ref. 25Inoue H. Nojiama H. Okajama H. Gene. 1990; 6: 23-28Crossref Scopus (1533) Google Scholar. A 0.9-kb SspI fragment out of the larger 2.8 kb fragment also positive with probe 1 was subcloned into pBluescript II SK− (plasmid pCBS2). Sequencing of the fragments was performed nonradioactively with Thermo Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a GATC 1500 direct blotting electrophoresis device (GATC) and the DIG system from Boehringer Mannheim as described in Ref. 26Purschke W.G. Schäfer G. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar. Total RNA was extracted from S. acidocaldarius cells with guanidium isothiocyanate and phenol using a commercially available kit (Roti-Quick-Kit, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Northern blotting and hybridization was performed as in Ref. 24Purschke W.G. Schmidt C.L. Petersen A. Schäfer G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 179: 1344-1353Crossref Google Scholar. Two RNA probes were produced by in vitro transcription of linearized DNA template (plasmid pCBS2 cut with XbaI or withBglII) with T7 polymerase and the DIG RNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) as described in Refs. 27Boehringer Mannheim The DIG System User's Guide for Filter Hybridization.

Hybridization and chemiluminescence detection was also performed as in Ref. 27Boehringer Mannheim The DIG System User's Guide for Filter Hybridization. Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany1993Google Scholar. To examine the influence of different growth media, S. acidocaldarius cells were grown on a small scale in a 1-liter fermenter under oxygen-limiting conditions. Select yeast extract was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; neutralized bacteriological peptone was from Oxoid (Basingstoke, United Kingdom); casein (enzymatic hydrolysate), l-leucine, and l-isoleucine were from Sigma; and 2-oxoglutaric acid was from Fluka (Deisenhofen, Germany). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7800 × g. Cells were disrupted for 5 min by ultrasonification, and membranes were prepared by down-scaling the procedure described previously (11Anemüller S. Schäfer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cytochrome b 558/566 content of the membranes was calculated based on the ascorbate-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized difference spectrum using an extinction coefficient of ε566–590 = 11,200m−1cm−1, determined by pyridine hemochromogen. The protein concentration of the membranes was determined as described above. The cytochrome composition of the membranes changes according to the oxygen level at which the cells are grown (7Gleißner M. Kaiser U. Antonopoulos E. Schäfer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8417-8426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Under low oxygenation, the expression of cytochrome b 558/566 strongly increases, whereas high oxygen levels (maximum air flow) suppress the production of this cytochrome nearly completely (15Schäfer G.

To isolate the protein, purified membranes were subjected to chaotropic pre-extraction with sodium pyrophosphate, which removed loosely bound proteins from the membrane. DM was used for solubilization as this detergent does not induce spectral changes of a- orb-type cytochromes (7Gleißner M. Kaiser U. Antonopoulos E. Schäfer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8417-8426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). High ionic strength, achieved by addition of 500 mm AS during the solubilization step, improved the efficiency of the subsequent chromatographic preparation steps. The following hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gel filtration (see “Experimental Procedures”) separates the cytochromeb 558/566 from other cytochromes. Fig.1 documents the process of purification resulting in a single protein band (right lane), susceptible to Coomassie Blue staining but not to silver staining. This unusual behavior led us to suspect that cytochromeb 558/566 might be a glycoprotein. Staining for sugar residues (not shown) confirmed this assumption. It was further corroborated by the observation that alkali treatment caused a considerable decrease of apparent molecular mass (not shown). This unexpected result also explains the observation that cytochromeb 558/566 is resistant to protease degradation (trypsin or V8; data not shown), a feature that was then included in the purification procedure. A tryptic digestion cleaved remaining contaminating proteins, and the final gel filtration removed these cleaved proteins as well as the added trypsin (Fig. 1, lane 5). The use of SB-12 instead of DM did not induce any spectral changes of cytochrome b 558/566 but led to a minor decrease in long-term stability and a slight increase in susceptibility to proteolytic digestion. In native membranes, cytochromeb 558/566 is the only cytochrome present in significant amounts that is readily reducible by ascorbate (6Schäfer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 163-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Schäfer G. Anemüller S. Moll R. Gleißner M. Schmidt C.L. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 16: 544-555Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Difference spectra (reduced minus oxidized) of the purified cytochromeb 558/566 resembled the spectral features of ascorbate-reduced S. acidocaldarius membranes, exhibiting maxima at 566 and 558 nm and a minimum at 561 nm in the α-band region and lower maxima at 530 and 538 nm in the β-region of the visible spectrum (Fig. 2). The Soret band in the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum was located at 430 nm. In the reduced spectrum it was found at 430 nm as well, whereas it shifted to 419 nm in the oxidized spectrum. The differential extinction coefficients are ε566–575 = 10,800m−1cm−1, ε566–590= 11,200, and ε430–439 = 65,900m−1cm−1 based on the hemeb content determined as pyridine hemochromogen. At liquid nitrogen temperature, the α-bands clearly resolved into two distinct and narrow peaks at 563 and 553 nm, whereas the β-bands moved to 527 and 534 nm (data not shown). The pyridine hemochrome spectrum (Fig. 2) with a maximum at 556 nm indicates that the purified compound contained only heme b. In the above spectral region, neither the isolated cytochrome, prepared according to the described procedure, nor native membranes displayed a CO-inducible difference spectrum in the reduced state, thus indicating a hexa-coordinated heme center without exchangeable ligand positions. This is in sharp contrast to former observations, in which the cytochrome had been extracted from membranes immersed in an imidazole buffer during detergent extraction (10Becker M. Schäfer G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Actually, prolonged exposure of membranes or detergent extracts to imidazole (0.1–0.6 m) causes the appearance of a confluent α-peak at 560–562 nm (28Becker, M. (1992) Isolierung und Charakterisierung eines b-typ Cytochroms aus Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. Ph.D. Thesis, Medizinische Universität zu Lübeck, Lübeck, Geremany.Google Scholar) with a high absorption coefficient, a behavior that we were able to reproduce with the purified cytochrome. Under the latter conditions, a reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum resulted, which upon addition of CO clearly indicated the formation of a carbon monoxide compound yielding a sharp trough at 560 nm (556 nm at liquid nitrogen temperature) in the difference spectrum (reduced plus CO, minus reduced) (Fig. 2). Obviously, imidazole promotes a ligand exchange and conformational distortion of the protein, facilitating the binding of CO to the heme center. This process is reversible, however, as demonstrated in independent experiments. Removal of imidazole, for example, by buffer exchange during chromatography restored the native situation with respect to spectal properties and eliminated any CO reactivity. This lack of CO reactivity and the fact that direct reoxidation of the easily reducible cytochrome by molecular oxygen could not be observed exclude a function as part of a terminal oxidase complex. The cytochrome is most stable when kept in the reduced form. If it is oxidized with K3[Fe(CN)6] and kept in the oxidized state at neutral pH for a prolonged time, the cytochrome is damaged irreversibly, as can be seen directly from a shift of the Soret band from 419 to 405 nm (data not shown). To minimize oxidative damage, the samples used for the EPR measurements were frozen shortly after oxidization with cerium(IV) salts. The most important feature of the EPR spectrum (Fig.3) is a highly anisotropic low spin heme signal with a g z value of 3.13 and a g y value of 2.09 (tentatively), due to a hexa-coordinated heme iron. The g y value is superimposed by another signal, possibly caused by loosely bound copper. Although the most prominent feature of the spectrum is a sharp high-spin signal at g = 6.05, this is most likely a preparation-induced property. As mentioned above, isolated cytochromeb 558/566 undergoes decay when kept in the oxidized state. Even if only a minor amount of the cytochrome is damaged, it will be enough to cause an apparently strong high spin resonance signal around g = 6. Due to the intense gz-resonance of the low spin heme, the high spin signal can be estimated to account for only 10–15% of the amount of the low spin signal. When using a pH 2–6 polyacrylamide gel, the pI was found to be in the range of 4–4.5 (data not shown). The apparent molecular mass (SDS-PAGE) was about 66 kDa (Fig. 1). This is in good agreement with the molecular mass determined by mass spectrometry: the positive ion MALDI-time of flight mass spectrum of cytochrome b 558/566 recorded in the linear mode is shown in Fig. 4. The spectrum comprises two prominent mass peaks representing the single- and double-charged quasimolecular ions at m/z = 64,210 and 32,091, respectively. Chemical deglycosylation led to a single band of about 55 kDa (Fig.5, lane 5, cytochromeb 558/566 as prepared; lane 6, after deglycosylation), which is in fair agreement with the molecular mass of 50,736 Da according to the gene-derived sequence (see below). The cytochrome b 558/566 precipitated almost completely during the neutralization step of the protocol, so that the soluble fraction of the deglycosylation procedure"

https://openalex.org/W2317236217,"p53 is a transcriptional activator that plays a key role in the integration of signals inducing cell division arrest and programmed cell death. Moreover, p53 is a tumor suppressor gene, mutations of which are the most commonly detected mutations in diverse malignancies. In order to better understand the significance of p53 mutations to human cancer, we isolated mutant alleles of p53 that had lost transcription factor activity in yeast. These mutant alleles were evaluated for their precise changes, their activity against three different p53 responsive enhancers and their ability to act in a transdominant fashion to the wild type allele. While many of the mutations isolated in yeast resembled those found in human tumors, consistent with the importance of transcription factor activity for p53 in mammalian cells, the mutational spectrum obtained was dependent upon the p53 enhancer employed for the selection. Some mutations specifically inactivated p53 in yeast for a single enhancer element. Virtually all missense mutations tested had a dominant inhibitory effect on wild type p53 in yeast. Since some of these transdominant mutations are virtually unknown in human tumors we conclude that transdominance, per se, fails to predict which mutations occur frequently in cancer."

Ret is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed mainly in neural crest-derived cells. In most cell types Ret proteins are expressed as glycoproteins of 150 and 170 kDa. The p150 ret and p170 ret proteins differ in their subcellular localization. Cell fractionation experiments showed that both isoforms are present in membrane fractions (1Iwamoto T. Taniguchi M. Asai N. Ohkusu K. Nakashima I. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1087-1091PubMed Google Scholar). However, the 170-kDa isoform of Ret is present at the plasma membrane, because biotinylation of intact Ret-expressing cells results in biotinylation of only the 170-kDa isoform of Ret. The p150 ret isoform is endoglycosidase H-sensitive, suggesting that p150 ret is an incompletely processed form of Ret, present in the endoplasmic reticulum (2Takahashi M. Asai N. Iwashita T.

Mutational analysis has shown that specific point mutations in the intracellular domain of Ret result in impaired tyrosine kinase activity. Mutations in the extracellular domain of Ret result in dramatically reduced levels of p170 ret expression at the plasma membrane (15Iwashita T. Murakami H. Asai N. Takahashi M. Hum. Mol.

Reduced levels of expression of functional Ret during embryonic development underlie the defects observed in Hirschsprung's disease patients, because in mice that completely lack Ret expression similar yet more severe symptoms are observed (17Schuchardt A.

J. Intern. Med. 1995; 238: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).In the extracellular domain of Ret, a cadherin-like domain of approximately 110 amino acids is present (19Kuma K.-I. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 539-551PubMed Google Scholar). In cadherins, this domain is repeated three or four times and mediates calcium binding and calcium-dependent homophilic interactions with cadherin molecules on other cells (20Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar). Also in the cadherin-like domain in Ret, consensus calcium-binding sequences are present. Asai et al.(3Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that a point mutation in one of these sequences results in a dramatic reduction of p170 ret expression at the plasma membrane, whereas p150 ret expression is not affected. They hypothesized that mutation of the putative calcium-binding site might interfere with processing of Ret in the Golgi complex or with Ret transport to the plasma membrane. Alternatively, it is possible that this mutant of Ret is fully processed and transported to the plasma membrane but cannot be retained at the membrane in the absence of calcium binding.We have investigated the role of calcium in cell surface expression of Ret. We found that calcium depletion completely abolishes cell surface expression of p170 ret . Furthermore, we show by pulse-chase experiments that processing of p150 ret into p170 ret is strongly impaired under conditions of calcium depletion. Finally, we provide evidence that this impaired processing is due to improper processing of Ret in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).DISCUSSIONWe have analyzed Ret expression in the stably transfected cell line SKP2, in which Ret is expressed as 150- and 170-kDa isoforms (11van Weering D.H.J. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Whereas p170 ret is a functional receptor located at the cell surface, p150 ret is insensitive to GDNF-stimulation and is located in the ER (3Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11van Weering D.H.J. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using pulse-chase experiments we now established previous proposals that p150 ret is a precursor of p170 ret (2Takahashi M. Asai N. Iwashita T. Isomura T. Miyazaki K. Matsuyama M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2925-2929PubMed Google Scholar, 3Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Takahashi M. Buma Y. Taniguchi M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 297-301PubMed Google Scholar). The half-life of both isoforms is approximately 1 h, which means that there is a relatively slow conversion of p150 ret into p170 ret but a relatively rapid down-regulation of p170 ret from the plasma membrane as compared with for instance the platelet-derived growth factor or insulin receptor (26Reed B.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Keating M.T. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7932-7937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Based on the observation that a mutation in the putative calcium-binding domain of Ret leads to aberrant expression of p170 ret (3Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have investigated the role of calcium in p170 ret expression. We observed that depletion of extracellular calcium results in down-regulation of p170 ret but not p150 ret expression. This provided us with an excellent system for studying in further detail the reason for the aberrant cell surface expression of p170 ret . Using pulse-chase experiments we found that calcium is necessary for proper processing of p150 ret . Furthermore, by depleting intracellular calcium stores with thapsigargin, we could show that ER luminal calcium is responsible for this proper processing, compatible with the reported localization of p150 ret proteins in the ER (3Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we provide evidence that once p150 ret proteins have left the ER, calcium is no longer necessary for proper processing. The finding that calcium affects processing of Ret in the ER is supported by the notion that the extracellular domain of Ret is responsible for the calcium sensitivity.In the ER, newly synthesized proteins are folded, and it has been shown for several proteins that high ER luminal calcium is necessary for proper folding (28Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10893-10899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lodish H.F. Kong N. Wikstrom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12753-12760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium could be either necessary for the many calcium-binding proteins (chaperones) involved in protein folding (30Macer D.R. Koch G.L. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 91: 61-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Suzuki C.K. Bonifacino J.S. Lin A.Y. Davis M.M. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 32Booth C. Koch G.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 729-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), or alternatively, calcium is directly involved in the three-dimensional structure of the newly synthesized protein, as shown for cadherins (33Overduin M. Harvey T.S. Bagby S. Tong K.I. Yau P. Takeichi M. Ikura M. Science. 1995; 267: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 34Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A protein is exported from the ER only if a protein is properly folded (“quality control”, for review see Ref.21Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The observed inhibition of p150 ret processing when ER luminal calcium is diminished is therefore most likely due to the failure to fold properly. This was further supported by the following observation: retention of p150 ret in the ER was diminished when Ret proteins were allowed to be folded in the presence of calcium and to be exported from the ER to the Golgi. When folded p150 ret proteins were subsequently returned from the Golgi to the ER using brefeldin A, they were no longer dependent on calcium for processing into p170 ret . Clearly, calcium affects p150 ret processing in the ER and does not influence processing after export from the ER.The extracellular domain of Ret contains a cadherin-like domain of approximately 110 amino acids (1Iwamoto T. Taniguchi M. Asai N. Ohkusu K. Nakashima I. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1087-1091PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kuma K.-I. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 539-551PubMed Google Scholar). In cadherins, this domain is repeated three or four times and mediates calcium binding and calcium-dependent homophilic interactions with cadherin molecules on other cells (20Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar). For correct folding of cadherin molecules, calcium binding is also essential (33Overduin M. Harvey T.S. Bagby S. Tong K.I. Yau P. Takeichi M. Ikura M. Science. 1995; 267: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 34Pokutta S. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that calcium directly affects the folding of this domain. Indeed, a mutation of a putative calcium-binding site in Ret also inhibits p150 ret processing (3Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the use of different methods, we were not able to convincingly show binding of calcium to full-length Ret proteins or to gluthationeS-transferase-Ret fusion proteins containing the putative calcium-binding domain of Ret (data not shown). Most likely, the affinity of this domain for calcium is very low, explaining not only the absence of detectable calcium binding but also the drastic effect of mild calcium depletion on p170 ret expression. An alternative explanation for the inhibition of p150 ret processing during extracellular calcium depletion is that calcium-binding chaperones are inhibited. This latter possibility is less obvious, because in general these chaperones have a very high affinity for calcium (22Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

D'Agati V. Larsson-Blomberg L. Costantini F. Pachnis V. Nature. 1994; 367: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar, 18Schuchardt A. D'Agati V. Larsson-Blomberg L. Costantini F. Pachnis V. J. Intern. Med. 1995; 238: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Indeed, point mutations in the intracellular domain of Ret, as observed in Hirschsprung's disease, result in impaired Ret tyrosine kinase activity (16Carlomagno F. De Vita G. Berlingieri M.T. de Franciscis V. Melillo R.M. Colantuoni V. Kraus M.H. Di Fiore P.P. Fusco A. Santoro M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2717-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 38Durick K. Yao V.J.

Genet. 1995; 10: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ret-linked Hirschsprung's disease is also caused by a variety of point mutations in the extracellular domain of Ret. These mutations result in dramatically reduced levels of p170 ret expression at the plasma membrane without affecting the presence of the 150-kDa form (15Iwashita T. Murakami H. Asai N. Takahashi M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1577-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Carlomagno F. De Vita G. Berlingieri M.T. de Franciscis V. Melillo R.M. Colantuoni V. Kraus M.H. Di Fiore P.P. Fusco A. Santoro M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2717-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the severity of the disease, as indicated by the length of the aganglionic segment, correlates with the degree of impairment of p170 ret expression (15Iwashita T. Murakami H. Asai N. Takahashi M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1577-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the extracellular domain of Ret is very sensitive for mutational alterations that either affect Ret processing or retention of Ret at the plasma membrane. Our results indicate that protein processing, most likely protein folding, is a delicate step in p150 ret processing that needs high levels of calcium in the ER to occur. Even under these conditions processing of p150 ret is slow, taking at least 1 h to proceed. The similarity between the aberrant expression of p170 ret in Hirschsprung's disease associated with mutations in the extracellular domain of Ret and the aberrant expression of p170 ret in the absence of calcium may indicate that the extracellular domain mutations also cause a defect in proper folding of p150 ret .Further research is necessary to show whether modulation of luminal calcium concentration is involved in the regulation of Ret expressionin vivo. However, inositol 3-phosphate-mediated release of calcium from internal stores is a common event after receptor stimulation, and perhaps this may affect processing of Ret. In addition, gradients of extracellular calcium do exist, for instance in the skin where calcium influences keratinocyte differentiation (40Menon G.K. Elias P.M. Arch. Dermatol. 1991; 127: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,41Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbroek K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Ret is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed mainly in neural crest-derived cells. In most cell types Ret proteins are expressed as glycoproteins of 150 and 170 kDa. The p150 ret and p170 ret proteins differ in their subcellular localization. Cell fractionation experiments showed that both isoforms are present in membrane fractions (1Iwamoto T. Taniguchi M. Asai N. Ohkusu K. Nakashima I. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1087-1091PubMed Google Scholar). However, the 170-kDa isoform of Ret is present at the plasma membrane, because biotinylation of intact Ret-expressing cells results in biotinylation of only the 170-kDa isoform of Ret. The p150 ret isoform is endoglycosidase H-sensitive, suggesting that p150 ret is an incompletely processed form of Ret, present in the endoplasmic reticulum (2Takahashi M. Asai N. Iwashita T. Isomura T. Miyazaki K. Matsuyama M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2925-2929PubMed Google Scholar, 3Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell.

Both forms of Ret are derived from a single polypeptide chain of approximately 120 kDa, as was shown by treatment of Ret-expressing cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of post-translational N-linked glycosylation (4Takahashi M. Buma Y. Taniguchi M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 297-301PubMed Google Scholar). Ret is part of a multi-component receptor for the transforming growth factor β-related neurotrophic factors glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) 1The abbreviations used are: GDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERKZ, extracellular signal-regulated kinase z; HERRet, human epidermal growth factor receptor-ret chimaeric receptor.1The abbreviations used are: GDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERKZ, extracellular signal-regulated kinase z; HERRet, human epidermal growth factor receptor-ret chimaeric receptor.and neurturin. GDNF and neurturin do not bind to or activate Ret directly but only via the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked adapter molecules GDNF receptor α (also called TrnR1 and RETL1) and neurturin receptor α (also called (TrnR2 and RETL2), respectively (5Jing S.

Mutations in the ret gene have been linked to several human syndromes, including multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A and 2B, familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, and Hirschsprung's disease (13Pasini B.

Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital disorder of the autonomic innervation of the gut (14Polley T.Z. Coran A.G. Pediatr. Surg. Int. 1986; 1: 80-83Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis has shown that specific point mutations in the intracellular domain of Ret result in impaired tyrosine kinase activity. Mutations in the extracellular domain of Ret result in dramatically reduced levels of p170 ret expression at the plasma membrane (15Iwashita T. Murakami H. Asai N. Takahashi M. Hum. Mol.

Protein identical to that predicted from the gene sequence was found in two heme C-containing fractions.

Three cytochromes c from Thermus thermophilus HB8 have been described (cf. Fee et al. for review (1Fee J.A. Kuila D. Mather M.W. Yoshida T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 853: 153-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)). One of these, the very basic cytochromec 552, is a good substrate for the terminal oxidase, cytochrome ba 3 (∼250 electrons/s at 25 °C (2Soulimane T. von Walter M. Hof P. Than M.E. Huber R. Buse G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and a poor substrate for the terminal oxidase cytochromecaa 3 (∼1–2 electrons/s at 25 °C, Ref. 3Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1031-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistic and biophysical examination of these respiratory enzymes is greatly impeded, because useful quantities are only obtained from large amounts of bacterial cell mass, and yields of the cytochromec 552 from T. thermophilus are small; for example, <1 mg of pure cytochrome c 552 is obtained from 1 kg of Thermus cell paste (4Yoshida T. Lorence R.M. Choc M.G. Tarr G.E. Findling K.L. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 112-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although this may depend on growth conditions and purification procedures (4Yoshida T. Lorence R.M. Choc M.G. Tarr G.E.

Studies on the functional properties of the two Thermuscytochrome c oxidases are thus limited by the availability of and by the need for designed mutations in the cytochromec. The prospect of having the three-dimensional structure of cytochrome ba 3 (6Soulimane T. Gohlke U. Huber R. Buse G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the report of an atomic resolution x-ray structure of native Thermus cytochromec 552 (7Than M.E. Hof P. Huber R.

Biol. 1997; 271: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) emphasize the potential of this system to provide novel insight on cytochrome c oxidase function. In the course of constructing a deletion series of a Thermusgenomic DNA fragment for sequencing the c 552locus, we observed that colonies from a certain time point in the series were distinctly reddish-brown in color (8Keightley, J. A., The Molecular Cloning and Nucleotide Sequence Analysis of the Genes Encoding Thermus thermophilus Cytochrome c552 and Cytochrome c Oxidase ba3 and the Expression of the Cytochrome c552 Gene in Escherichia coli.Ph.D. thesis, 1993, University of New Mexico.Google Scholar). This led us to attempt engineered expression of the cytochromec 552 gene in E. coli. The c-type cytochromes have covalently attached heme groups usually linked via thioether bonds between two cysteine residues and the 2- and 4-vinyl groups of the heme. Bacterial cytochromesc are located in the periplasmic space in Gram-negative bacteria, or in the case of Gram-postive bacteria, they are bound to the outer surface of the plasma membrane by means of a hydrophobic N-terminal segment (9von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13939-13948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome c 552 ofT. thermophilus was previously shown to be located in the periplasmic space (10Lorence R.M. Yoshida T. Findling K.L. Fee J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Bacterial cytochrome c synthesis involves several steps: (a) a pre-apocytochrome cis synthesized in the cytoplasm, i.e. a protein having no heme attached and which possesses an additional N-terminal domain containing signals to transport the protein across the plasma membrane and to specifically proteolyze the signal sequence peptide. (b) The apoprotein and protoheme IX are transported across the plasma membrane, where the signal peptide is cleaved. (c) Once heme and apoprotein are in the periplasmic space, the heme is covalently attached to the protein. And finally, (d) the protein folds into the conformation of the mature holoprotein (cf. Ref. 11Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar for review). While many details remain unknown, the entire process occurs within a few seconds of protein synthesis (12Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5935-5943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As many as 16 genes and/or gene products are essential for cytochromec synthesis (cf. Refs. 11Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol.

Included are ferrochelatase (HemH), an enzyme responsible for incorporating iron into protoporphyrin IX (14Frustaci J.M. O'Brian M.R. J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5279-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for review and additional citations). Finally, there are specialized gene products for synthesis of specific cytochromes c, e.g. cytochromec 1 of the bc 1 complex (19Page M.D. Ferguson S.J. Mol.

A. 1991; 88: 5001-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and there appear to be specific sequences within the cytochrome c molecule itself that contain information to guide the synthetic process (23Caffrey M.

Given the complexity of cytochrome c maturation, one might suspect that heterologous expression would be inefficient and, indeed, there are numerous reports to that effect (25McEwan A.G. Kaplan S.

The cell mass obtained from each liter of culture medium yielded 1–2 mg of holoprotein, all of which appeared to reside in the periplasm. This allowed the authors to obtain enough protein for high-resolution NMR studies. Sambongi and Ferguson (33Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) made the remarkable observation that synthesis of holo Paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c 550 in E. coli requires an N-terminal signal peptide to target the gene product to the periplasm, whereas E. coli can synthesize holo Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochromec 552 without targeting to the periplasm. These authors attributed heme C formation to “spontaneous cytoplasmic attachment of heme to the (properly folded) thermostable protein,” revealing yet another complexity of cytochrome c synthesis in E. coli. We describe here the first heterologous expression system for large scale preparation of Thermuscytochrome c 552 from E. coli and our initial characterization of the gene products. Genomic DNA was isolated fromT. thermophilus strain HB8 (ATCC 27634) as described previously (34Mather M.W. Fee J.A. Plasmid. 1990; 24: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). E. coli strains were cultured in L-broth (35Bertani G. J. Bacteriol. 1952; 62: 293-300Crossref Google Scholar) modified by omitting glucose and lowering the sodium chloride to 0.5%, with 1.5% agar (Difco) for plates. Plasmid preparations were carried out by standard procedures (36Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Probe design for genomic hydridization was based on the method of most probable codons (37Lathe R. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) program CODONFREQUENCY. The cytochrome c 552 gene was isolated on a 1.6-kilobase KpnI genomic restriction fragment by the method of Mather et al. (40Mather M.W. Keightley J.A. Fee J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and cloned in the Stratagene vector BSII(SK+), generating plasmid p13BCYCA (8Keightley, J.

An exonuclease III deletion series was constructed to sequence the sense strand (Erase-a-base system, Promega), and synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used to sequence the antisense strand. Sequencing was performed by the method of Sanger et al. (41Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The c 552reading frame was amplified by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; phc, pyridine hemochrome; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. from p13BCYCA (42Keightley J.A.

The expression vector pET17b (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used to harbor and direct the synthesis of the following construct in E. colistrain BL21(DE3). The sense-strand primer, 5′-d(CTGCTCGGCGGCCTGGCAT ATG GCCCAG)-3′, introduces an NdeI site (underlined) and the start codon (bold type). The antisense primer, 5′-d(CTGGGCCAGCATGGGATCCGGTTACTT)-3′, introduces a BamHI site (underlined) just downstream of the native stop codon (bold type). PCR primers were synthesized at the California Institute of Technology using an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer. The PCR reaction was optimized using the HotWax OptiStart Kit™ (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The PCR fragment was gel-purified to remove excess primers, nucleotides, and PCR buffer from the sample. After digesting the PCR fragment and pET17b with NdeI andBamHI, each was agarose gel-purified. The prepared vector and insert fragments were ligated with T4DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Bacterial strain BL21(DE3) was transformed to ampicillin resistance with the ligation mixture and colonies containing the construct pETC552 were isolated for analysis. The construct was verified by DNA sequencing on an Applied Biosystems Prism DNA sequencing system at the California Institute of Technology sequencing facility. Optical spectra were recorded on a SLM/AMINCO model DB3500 spectrophotometer in 1-cm cells. Fully oxidized proteins were obtained by making the solution 10 μm in ferricyanide, and reduced proteins were prepared by adding a small amount of strongly buffered sodium dithionite solution directly to the optical cuvette. The reduced-oxidized extinction coefficient, Δε = 14.3 mm−1cm−1 (5Hon-nami K. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 82: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was used to determine approximate concentrations of the recombinant cytochromes c. Pyridine hemochromes were prepared and quantified according to the method of Berry and Trumpower (43Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Second derivatives of absorption spectra were obtained using the Macintosh program, IGOR (Wavemetrics Inc., Portland, OR). Protein was measured by the BCA protein assay kit of Pierce according to manufacturer's instructions. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was determined polarographically at 25 °C in a Gilson water-jacketed cell using a YSI 5331 oxygen probe (Yellow Springs Instruments) and a Chemtrix type 30 oxygen meter with output to a strip-chart recorder. Amino acid analyses and N-terminal sequencing were done in the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at the University of New Mexico and carried out as described by Keightley et al. (42Keightley J.A.

Reaction of protein with iodoacetic acid was carried out as described by Simpson et al. (44Simpson R.J. Neuberger M.R. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1936-1940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions of the N-terminal sequence analysis, carboxymethyl cysteine has the same chromatographic properties as serine. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out, with minor modifications, according to Downer et al. (45Downer N.W. Robinson N.C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2930-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis cell (Hercules, CA). Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was carried out with reversed polarity using the same apparatus according to the method of Gabriel (46Gabriel O. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 22: 565-578Crossref Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out at the Scripps Research Institute Mass Spectrometry Facility (La Jolla, CA) using a Perkin-Elmer SCIEX API III mass analyzer with the orifice potential set at 100 V (47Siuzdak G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11290-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Reconstructions of mass spectra from ion spectra were made using the Perkin-Elmer program Bio-MultiView. The GCG (39Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) program, PEPTIDESORT, was used to calculate expected properties of the isolated gene products. 10 ml of culture medium (LB and 50 mg/ml ampicillin) were inoculated from a freshly streaked plate of E. coli (strain BL21-DE3) cells containing the pETC552 plasmid. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, this culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium, containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin, in a 2.8-liter Fernbach flask. This culture was incubated at 37 °C overnight on a rotary shaker set at 125 rpm. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was distinctively reddish-brown color, indicating heme protein overproduction. The pellet from 1 liter of culture was resuspended in 25 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mg/ml lysozyme, 40 units/ml DNase I, 3 units/ml RNase A, 0.1% Triton X-100.p-toluenesulfonyl fluoride was added (2 mm) to inhibit proteolysis, and the extract was incubated at 30 °C for at least 30 min. The cell debris was separated from the extract by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, which had the characteristic reddish-brown color, was loaded onto a CM-52 gravity column that had been equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (25 mm TE buffer (TE buffer: 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0)) at 4 °C, washed overnight with several column volumes of equilibration buffer, and eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 10 mm TE buffer. Fractions containing the reddish-orange protein were combined and concentrated using Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon) with YM-3 or YM-10 membranes. The concentrated protein was desalted (10 mm TE buffer) using a PD-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and passed over a EconoPac CM Column (Bio-Rad) attached to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography purification system. The column was washed with several column volumes of the same buffer, and the protein was eluted with a gradient of 0–2 m NaCl in 10 mm TE buffer. The final step of the procedure involves fast protein liquid chromatography purification using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated with TE buffer (see Fig. 3). The protein was concentrated as described above. The amino acid sequence of T. thermophilus HB8 cytochrome c 552 was previously determined by Edman degradation of proteolytically generated peptides (48Titani K. Ericsson L.H. Hon-nami K. Miyazawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We used reverse translation and took advantage of the highly skewed codon usage of T. thermophilus (cf. Refs. 49Mather M.W. Springer P. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5025-5035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 50Mather M.W. Springer P. Hensel S. Buse G. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5395-5408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to design a nondegenerate oligonucleotide probe for the gene that was complimentary to the protein sequence, QGQIEVKGMKYNG: 5′-(CCGTTCTACTTCATCCCCTTGACCTCGATCTGCCCCTG). This probe was used to identify and isolate a 1.6-kilobase pairKpnI fragment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The entire fragment was sequenced on both strands and is presented in Fig. 1; the sequence of the probe was found to differ in only 4 of the 38 positions (at the positions underlined above). The DNA sequence reveals two open reading frames. The first open reading frame begins at position 154 and ends at position 600 with the stop codon TAA. The translated nucleotide sequence from 205 to 597 corresponds to the chemically determined amino acid sequence of native cytochrome c 552 (48Titani K. Ericsson L.H. Hon-nami K. Miyazawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and we designate thiscycA. Translation from position 154 through 204 indicates the presence of a 17-amino acid signal peptide (underlinedin Fig. 1; cf. Ref. 51von Heijne G. Abrahmsen L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The region upstream of the initiation codon (position 154) contains elements that probably serve as a promoter, including −10 and −35 regions and a ribosome binding site, also underlined in Fig. 1 (cf. Ref. 52Maseda H. Hoshino T. FEMS Microbiol. 1995; 128: 127-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a review of Thermus promoters). Only 9 bases downstream of the TAA stop codon in cycA, a second open reading frame begins at nucleotide 610 and ends with a termination codon (TAG) at 1404; we designate this region as cycB. The DNA sequences in the cycA and cycB regions were subjected to codon usage analysis using a table of codon usage generated from 14 previously sequenced T. thermophilus genes (cf. Ref. 42Keightley J.A. Zimmermann B.H. Mather M.W. Springer P. Pastuszyn A. Lawrence D.M. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20345-20358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The average codon preference value for cycA (nt 154 to nt 600) = 1.3084, and the value for cycB (nt 610 to nt 1404) = 1.2317, values typical of other Thermus genes (cf. Refs. 42Keightley J.A.

Springer P. Hensel S. Buse G. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5395-5408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, average codon preferences of the other two possible frames in these two regions range from 0.3858 to 0.7692. These results reveal that both cycAand cycB adhere closely to Thermus usage and are thus properly assigned as open reading frames. The sequence ofcycA predicts exactly the amino acid sequence of cytochromec 552 determined chemically by Titani et al. (48Titani K. Ericsson L.H. Hon-nami K. Miyazawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The translated amino acid sequence from cycB is also shown in Fig. 1. A TFASTA search (53Gribskov M. Homyak M. Edenfield J. Eisenberg D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 61-66PubMed Google Scholar) against the Swissprot data base retrieved numerous proteins that share amino acid sequence similarity, with the highest scoring hits being members of the protein superfamily known as ABC transporters (data not shown). These form a diverse group of enzymes that bind and hydrolyze ATP to drive the transport of signal sequence-independent transport of polypeptides, organic molecules, or ions across membranes (cf. Ref. 20Fath M.J. Kolter R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 995-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a general review). As reviewed by Thöny-Meyer (11Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), a subset of this family is essential for cytochrome c maturation. Fig.2 shows a complete alignment of the CycB amino acid sequence with those of the ATP-binding subunit of selected ABC transporters that have been implicated in cytochrome cmaturation in several eubacteria. The designated A- and B-sites (Fig.2) form the ATP binding fold (20Fath M.J. Kolter R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 995-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar), and the sequence similarity in these regions as well as throughout the molecule is evident. CycB fromThermus thus appears to be a homolog of known cytochromec maturation proteins and therefore probably has the same function in T. thermophilus (see “Discussion”). Two palindromic sequences were identified using the GCG (39Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) program STEMLOOP as underlined in Fig. 1. The first palindromic sequence occurs at nt 606 to nt 617 with a complementary sequence at nt 633 to nt 622. This includes 2 G=U pairings, which suggests that this palindrome may form in the mRNA and thus may regulate a termination of translation. Since the start codon of cycB is located in the leading strand of this potential structure, it may provide part of an attenuation signal to modulate CycB formation. 2A significant effort was made to detect an RNA transcript in Thermus cells containing both cycAand cycB using Northern analyses (36Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). By rapidly coolingThermus cells grown at 70 °C to ice temperature, we were able to detect very low levels of an RNA molecule that bound an oligonucleotide probe specific for cycA but could not detect any RNA using an oligonucleotide probe specific for cycB(J. A. Fee, J. A. Keightley, and D. Sanders, unpublished results). Potentially the strongest stemloop-forming sequence begins at nt 1435 to nt 1448 with a complementary region nt 1466 to nt 1453. This occurs 30 nucleotides after the termination codon of cycB, it contains a single A-C mismatch and is probably involved in termination of transcription. Although functional in Thermus cells, the suggested promoter elements upstream of cycA (Fig. 1) do not direct the expression of detectable amounts of cytochromec 552 in E. coli. Other T. thermophilus HB8 promoters containing similar −10 and −35 elements do function in E. coli (cf. Refs.55Sato S. Nakada Y. Kanaya S. Tanaka T. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2071877809,"The multisubunit IκB kinase (IKK) catalyzes the signal-inducible phosphorylation of N-terminal serines of IκB. This phosphorylation is the key step in regulating the subsequent ubiquitination and proteolysis of IκB, which then releases NF-κB to promote gene transcription. As measured by 33P incorporation into a GST-IκBα fusion protein, varying both the concentration of GST-IκBα and [γ-33P]ATP resulted in a kinetic pattern consistent with a random, sequential binding mechanism. Values of 55 nm and 7 μm were obtained for the dissociation constants of GST-IκBα and ATP, respectively. The value of α, a factor by which binding of one substrate changes the dissociation constant for the other substrate, was determined to be 0.11. This indicates that the two substrates bind in a cooperative fashion. Peptides corresponding to either amino acids 26–42 (N-terminal peptide) or amino acids 279–303 (C-terminal peptide) of IκBα inhibited the IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of GST-IκBα; the C-terminal peptide, unexpectedly, was more potent. The inhibition by the C-terminal peptide was competitive with respect to GST-IκBα and mixed with respect to ATP, which verified the sequential binding mechanism. The C-terminal peptide was also a substrate for the enzyme, and a dissociation constant of 2.9–6.2 μm was obtained. Additionally, the N-terminal peptide was a substrate (K m = 140 μm). Competitive inhibition of the IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the C-terminal peptide by the N-terminal peptide indicated that the peptides are phosphorylated by the same active site. Surprisingly, the presence of the C-terminal peptide greatly accelerated the rate of phosphorylation of the N-terminal peptide as represented by a 160-fold increase in the apparent second-order rate constant (k cat/K m ). These results are consistent with an allosteric site present within IKK that recognizes the C terminus of IκBα and activates the enzyme. This previously unobserved interaction with the C terminus may represent an important mechanism by which the enzyme recognizes and phosphorylates IκB.

The NF-κB/Rel family of transcriptional activators regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-1β; the adhesion molecules E-selectin and VCAM-1; and the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (for reviews, see Refs. 1Siebenlist U.

Cell. 1997; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2918) Google Scholar).In unstimulated cells, NF-κB normally resides in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex with an IκB inhibitory protein. This class of protein includes IκB-α, IκB-β, and IκB-ε, which all contain ankyrin repeats necessary for complexation with NF-κB (for a review, see Ref. 3Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the case of IκB-α, which is the most carefully studied member of this class, stimulation of cells with agents that activate NF-κB-dependent gene transcription results in a phosphorylation of IκB-α at Ser-32 and Ser-36 (4Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). This is critical for subsequent ubiquitination and proteolysis of IκB-α, which then leaves NF-κB free to translocate to the nucleus and promote gene transcription (5Finco T.S. Beg A.A.

Indeed, a mutant in which both Ser-32 and Ser-36 have been changed to alanine prevents signal-induced activation of NF-κB and results in an IκB-α that is neither phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, nor proteolytically digested (7Roff M.

Analogous serines have been identified in both IκB-β and IκB-ε, and phosphorylation at these residues appears to regulate the proteolytic degradation of these proteins by a mechanism similar to that of IκB-α (8Weil R.

IKK-α and IKK-β form homo- and heterodimers with each other, but the active complex appears to be the heterodimer (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar,14Zandi E. Rothwarf D. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Demonstration that IKK is the kinase involved in the signal-inducible degradation of IκB-α was accomplished by both antisense inhibition of IKK-α and the use of dominant negative, catalytically inactive mutants of IKK-α and IKK-β (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar, 15Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Both approaches abrogated cytokine-induced activation of NF-κB. The signal-induced activation of IKK appears to proceed through phosphorylation of the IKK-α and/or IKK-β subunits by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (such as mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase-1 or NF-κB-inducing kinase), which greatly enhances the enzymatic activity.A knowledge of the mechanism is central to the understanding of any enzyme. To this end, we report here a kinetic investigation of the multisubunit IKK that demonstrates, surprisingly, that the enzyme recognizes and is stimulated by elements of the C terminus of IκBα.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here clearly demonstrate that the IKK proceeds through a random sequential binding mechanism in which both substrates bind before the first product is released (Scheme FS1). During the course of this work, however, a number of surprising observations were made, including the finding that the enzyme recognizes a peptide corresponding to amino acids 279–303 of the C terminus of IκB-α. Indeed, this C-terminal peptide inhibited the IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of IκB-α. Recognition by the enzyme of the C terminus of IκB-α is surprising because IKK has been shown to phosphorylate at Ser-32 and Ser-36 within the N terminus of IκB-α (13Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The inhibition shown by this peptide, however, does explain the findings of Kuno et al. (20Kuno K. Ishikawa Y. Ernst M.K. Ogata M. Rice N.R. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27914-27919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), in which this same C-terminal peptide was shown to block both LPS-induced NF-κB activation and phosphorylation of IκB-α in a cell-free system.Our additional finding that the C-terminal peptide is phosphorylated by IKK corroborates a recent report that showed that a small amount of IκB-α phosphorylation catalyzed by IKK occurs within residues 264–314 of the C terminus (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). The present results also show that the enzyme phosphorylated an N-terminal peptide corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκB-α. Competitive inhibition of C-terminal peptide phosphorylation by the N-terminal peptide (Fig. 5) indicated that these peptides are not phosphorylated by two different enzymes within the IKK preparation but, instead, are binding to the same active site.The most surprising observation was that the rate of IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the N-terminal peptide was greatly increased in the presence of the C-terminal peptide. This effect resulted from both an increase in the k cat(V max) and a decrease in the apparentK m (Fig. 6 and Table I). A small but discernible increase in the rate of IκB-α phosphorylation was also observed at low concentrations of the C-terminal peptide (results not shown). The activation by the C-terminal peptide presumably occurs through its binding to a regulatory site other than the active site. The activation of the active site may result from a conformational change in the enzyme induced by C-terminal peptide binding to this putative regulatory site.This observation that the C terminus of IκB-α activates the IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the N terminus can be used to reconcile the variable dissociation constants measured for the N-terminal peptide. For instance, when the N-terminal peptide was used as a substrate in the absence of the C-terminal peptide, aK m of 140 ± 28 μm was determined. When the N-terminal peptide was used as an inhibitor of C-terminal peptide phosphorylation, a considerably smaller dissociation constant (apparent K I ) of 12 ± 2 μm was obtained. This is consistent with the C-terminal peptide increasing the affinity of the enzyme for the N-terminal peptide. In addition, the data represented in Fig. 2 can be used with the K I determined for the C-terminal peptide to estimate a dissociation constant (K I ) of 43 ± 27 μm for the N-terminal peptide when used as an inhibitor of IκB-α phosphorylation. This dissociation constant for the N-terminal peptide is also smaller than the K m value of 140 μm because the C terminus of IκB-α is able to activate the IKK to bind the N-terminal peptide.Although the apparent K m for the N-terminal peptide in the absence of the C-terminal peptide is 140 μm, the apparent K m in the presence of the C-terminal peptide is reduced to a value of 21 μm (Table I). In fact, this apparent K m in the presence of the C-terminal peptide is an overestimate of the “true” dissociation constant under these conditions. This is because the C-terminal peptide is competitively inhibiting the binding of the N-terminal peptide at the active site even though C-terminal binding to the putative regulatory site is enhancing N-terminal peptide binding. Thus, the value of the true dissociation constant (K m ) for the N-terminal peptide is approximately 4 μm when activated by C-terminal peptide binding to a regulatory site (i.e. K m app = K m (1 + [I]/K I ), where [I] andK I equal the concentration and active-site dissociation constant, respectively, of the C-terminal peptide (21Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman & Sons, New York1985: 107-109Google Scholar)). Therefore, the presence of the C-terminal peptide increases the apparent second-order rate constant (k cat/K m ) for the phosphorylation of the N-terminal peptide by a factor of at least 160 as compared with the value in the absence of the C-terminal peptide (i.e., 291/4 versus64/140).The V max values for N-terminal peptide phosphorylation were plotted at various C-terminal peptide concentrations to give a hyperbolic dependence (Fig.7). This implies that the dissociation constant for the binding of the C-terminal peptide to the regulatory site is approximately 1 μm. Thus, binding of the C terminus to this putative regulatory site may provide most of the overall free energy of binding of IκB-α to the enzyme. Moreover, this model may account for the specificity of phosphorylation of IκB-α at Ser-32/Ser-36 because activation of the active site would only occur when the C terminus of IκB-α is bound to the enzyme. In fact, when the C terminus of IκB-α is bound to the regulatory site, the N terminus may then be optimally positioned to interact with the now-activated active site.This finding that the IKK recognizes and is activated by the C terminus of IκB-α also has important ramifications for our understanding of both the regulation of the degradation of IκB-α and the activation of NF-κB. Indeed, the presence and phosphorylation state of the C terminus of IκB-α has been shown to play a role in the signal-induced degradation of IκB-α (22Beauparlant P. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10690-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Aoki R. Sano Y. Yamamoto T. Inoue J.

An analogous C-terminal region rich in proline, glutamate, aspartate, serine, and threonine residues (termed the PEST domain) has also been identified in IκB-β (8Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent report has indicated that recombinantly transferring the C terminus (along with the N terminus) of IκB-α to an unrelated protein, such as GST, enables GST to be phosphorylated and degraded in a signal-responsive way (27Brown K. Franzoso G. Baldi L. Carlson L. Mills L. Lin Y.C. Gerstberger S. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although this may result from a recognition of the C terminus by the proteasome (26Kroll M. Conconi M. Desterro M.J.P. Marin A. Thomas D. Friguet B. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Rodriguez M.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1841-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Transferring only the N terminus of IκB-α to GST did not result in a recombinant protein that underwent signal-induced proteolysis.Because the IKK is composed of multiple subunits, it is not clear whether activation by the C terminus of IκB-α results from binding to an allosteric site on the IKK-α and/or IKK-β catalytic subunits or through binding to another subunit within the complex, which then allosterically affects these catalytic kinase subunit(s). Because it has been reported that IKK-α and IKK-β need to form a heterodimer for maximal enzyme activity (15Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar), an intriguing possibility is that the binding of the C terminus of IκB-α to one of the catalytic subunits (IKK-α, for instance) allosterically affects the other subunit (IKK-β in this example) to accelerate the N-terminal phosphorylation of a second IκB-α molecule. We are currently addressing these questions through the use of purified IKK-α and IKK-β catalytic subunits. The NF-κB/Rel family of transcriptional activators regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-1β; the adhesion molecules E-selectin and VCAM-1; and the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (for reviews, see Refs. 1Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar and 2Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB normally resides in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex with an IκB inhibitory protein. This class of protein includes IκB-α, IκB-β, and IκB-ε, which all contain ankyrin repeats necessary for complexation with NF-κB (for a review, see Ref. 3Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the case of IκB-α, which is the most carefully studied member of this class, stimulation of cells with agents that activate NF-κB-dependent gene transcription results in a phosphorylation of IκB-α at Ser-32 and Ser-36 (4Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). This is critical for subsequent ubiquitination and proteolysis of IκB-α, which then leaves NF-κB free to translocate to the nucleus and promote gene transcription (5Finco T.S. Beg A.A.

Indeed, a mutant in which both Ser-32 and Ser-36 have been changed to alanine prevents signal-induced activation of NF-κB and results in an IκB-α that is neither phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, nor proteolytically digested (7Roff M.

Analogous serines have been identified in both IκB-β and IκB-ε, and phosphorylation at these residues appears to regulate the proteolytic degradation of these proteins by a mechanism similar to that of IκB-α (8Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.-C. Rice N.R. Israel A.

Because of its important role in the activation of NF-κB, the inhibition of this signal-inducible phosphorylation of IκB is an important target for novel anti-inflammatory agents.

The kinase activity is greatly enhanced if the cells are first treated with tumor necrosis factor-α, which appears to activate a kinase cascade leading to the phosphorylation of the IKK (11Lee F.S.

IKK-α and IKK-β form homo- and heterodimers with each other, but the active complex appears to be the heterodimer (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Demonstration that IKK is the kinase involved in the signal-inducible degradation of IκB-α was accomplished by both antisense inhibition of IKK-α and the use of dominant negative, catalytically inactive mutants of IKK-α and IKK-β (12DiDonato J.A.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Both approaches abrogated cytokine-induced activation of NF-κB. The signal-induced activation of IKK appears to proceed through phosphorylation of the IKK-α and/or IKK-β subunits by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (such as mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase-1 or NF-κB-inducing kinase), which greatly enhances the enzymatic activity. A knowledge of the mechanism is central to the understanding of any enzyme. To this end, we report here a kinetic investigation of the multisubunit IKK that demonstrates, surprisingly, that the enzyme recognizes and is stimulated by elements of the C terminus of IκBα. DISCUSSIONThe results presented here clearly demonstrate that the IKK proceeds through a random sequential binding mechanism in which both substrates bind before the first product is released (Scheme FS1). During the course of this work, however, a number of surprising observations were made, including the finding that the enzyme recognizes a peptide corresponding to amino acids 279–303 of the C terminus of IκB-α. Indeed, this C-terminal peptide inhibited the IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of IκB-α. Recognition by the enzyme of the C terminus of IκB-α is surprising because IKK has been shown to phosphorylate at Ser-32 and Ser-36 within the N terminus of IκB-α (13Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The inhibition shown by this peptide, however, does explain the findings of Kuno et al. (20Kuno K. Ishikawa Y. Ernst M.K. Ogata M. Rice N.R. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27914-27919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), in which this same C-terminal peptide was shown to block both LPS-induced NF-κB activation and phosphorylation of IκB-α in a cell-free system.Our additional finding that the C-terminal peptide is phosphorylated by IKK corroborates a recent report that showed that a small amount of IκB-α phosphorylation catalyzed by IKK occurs within residues 264–314 of the C terminus (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). The present results also show that the enzyme phosphorylated an N-terminal peptide corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκB-α. Competitive inhibition of C-terminal peptide phosphorylation by the N-terminal peptide (Fig. 5) indicated that these peptides are not phosphorylated by two different enzymes within the IKK preparation but, instead, are binding to the same active site.The most surprising observation was that the rate of IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the N-terminal peptide was greatly increased in the presence of the C-terminal peptide. This effect resulted from both an increase in the k cat(V max) and a decrease in the apparentK m (Fig. 6 and Table I). A small but discernible increase in the rate of IκB-α phosphorylation was also observed at low concentrations of the C-terminal peptide (results not shown). The activation by the C-terminal peptide presumably occurs through its binding to a regulatory site other than the active site. The activation of the active site may result from a conformational change in the enzyme induced by C-terminal peptide binding to this putative regulatory site.This observation that the C terminus of IκB-α activates the IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the N terminus can be used to reconcile the variable dissociation constants measured for the N-terminal peptide. For instance, when the N-terminal peptide was used as a substrate in the absence of the C-terminal peptide, aK m of 140 ± 28 μm was determined. When the N-terminal peptide was used as an inhibitor of C-terminal peptide phosphorylation, a considerably smaller dissociation constant (apparent K I ) of 12 ± 2 μm was obtained. This is consistent with the C-terminal peptide increasing the affinity of the enzyme for the N-terminal peptide. In addition, the data represented in Fig. 2 can be used with the K I determined for the C-terminal peptide to estimate a dissociation constant (K I ) of 43 ± 27 μm for the N-terminal peptide when used as an inhibitor of IκB-α phosphorylation. This dissociation constant for the N-terminal peptide is also smaller than the K m value of 140 μm because the C terminus of IκB-α is able to activate the IKK to bind the N-terminal peptide.Although the apparent K m for the N-terminal peptide in the absence of the C-terminal peptide is 140 μm, the apparent K m in the presence of the C-terminal peptide is reduced to a value of 21 μm (Table I). In fact, this apparent K m in the presence of the C-terminal peptide is an overestimate of the “true” dissociation constant under these conditions. This is because the C-terminal peptide is competitively inhibiting the binding of the N-terminal peptide at the active site even though C-terminal binding to the putative regulatory site is enhancing N-terminal peptide binding. Thus, the value of the true dissociation constant (K m ) for the N-terminal peptide is approximately 4 μm when activated by C-terminal peptide binding to a regulatory site (i.e. K m app = K m (1 + [I]/K I ), where [I] andK I equal the concentration and active-site dissociation constant, respectively, of the C-terminal peptide (21Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman & Sons, New York1985: 107-109Google Scholar)). Therefore, the presence of the C-terminal peptide increases the apparent second-order rate constant (k cat/K m ) for the phosphorylation of the N-terminal peptide by a factor of at least 160 as compared with the value in the absence of the C-terminal peptide (i.e., 291/4 versus64/140).The V max values for N-terminal peptide phosphorylation were plotted at various C-terminal peptide concentrations to give a hyperbolic dependence (Fig.7). This implies that the dissociation constant for the binding of the C-terminal peptide to the regulatory site is approximately 1 μm. Thus, binding of the C terminus to this putative regulatory site may provide most of the overall free energy of binding of IκB-α to the enzyme. Moreover, this model may account for the specificity of phosphorylation of IκB-α at Ser-32/Ser-36 because activation of the active site would only occur when the C terminus of IκB-α is bound to the enzyme. In fact, when the C terminus of IκB-α is bound to the regulatory site, the N terminus may then be optimally positioned to interact with the now-activated active site.This finding that the IKK recognizes and is activated by the C terminus of IκB-α also has important ramifications for our understanding of both the regulation of the degradation of IκB-α and the activation of NF-κB. Indeed, the presence and phosphorylation state of the C terminus of IκB-α has been shown to play a role in the signal-induced degradation of IκB-α (22Beauparlant P. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol.

Transferring only the N terminus of IκB-α to GST did not result in a recombinant protein that underwent signal-induced proteolysis.Because the IKK is composed of multiple subunits, it is not clear whether activation by the C terminus of IκB-α results from binding to an allosteric site on the IKK-α and/or IKK-β catalytic subunits or through binding to another subunit within the complex, which then allosterically affects these catalytic kinase subunit(s). Because it has been reported that IKK-α and IKK-β need to form a heterodimer for maximal enzyme activity (15Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar), an intriguing possibility is that the binding of the C terminus of IκB-α to one of the catalytic subunits (IKK-α, for instance) allosterically affects the other subunit (IKK-β in this example) to accelerate the N-terminal phosphorylation of a second IκB-α molecule. We are currently addressing these questions through the use of purified IKK-α and IKK-β catalytic subunits. The results presented here clearly demonstrate that the IKK proceeds through a random sequential binding mechanism in which both substrates bind before the first product is released (Scheme FS1). During the course of this work, however, a number of surprising observations were made, including the finding that the enzyme recognizes a peptide corresponding to amino acids 279–303 of the C terminus of IκB-α. Indeed, this C-terminal peptide inhibited the IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of IκB-α. Recognition by the enzyme of the C terminus of IκB-α is surprising because IKK has been shown to phosphorylate at Ser-32 and Ser-36 within the N terminus of IκB-α (13Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The inhibition shown by this peptide, however, does explain the findings of Kuno et al. (20Kuno K. Ishikawa Y. Ernst M.K. Ogata M. Rice N.R. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27914-27919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), in which this same C-terminal peptide was shown to block both LPS-induced NF-κB activation and phosphorylation of IκB-α in a cell-free system. Our additional finding that the C-terminal peptide is phosphorylated by IKK corroborates a recent report that showed that a small amount of IκB-α phosphorylation catalyzed by IKK occurs within residues 264–314 of the C terminus (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). The present results also show that the enzyme phosphorylated an N-terminal peptide corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκB-α. Competitive inhibition of C-terminal peptide phosphorylation by the N-terminal peptide (Fig. 5) indicated that these peptides are not phosphorylated by two different enzymes within the IKK preparation but, instead, are binding to the same active site. The most surprising observation was that the rate of IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the N-terminal peptide was greatly increased in the presence of the C-terminal peptide. This effect resulted from both an increase in the k cat(V max) and a decrease in the apparentK m (Fig. 6 and Table I). A small but discernible increase in the rate of IκB-α phosphorylation was also observed at low concentrations of the C-terminal peptide (results not shown). The activation by the C-terminal peptide presumably occurs through its binding to a regulatory site other than the active site. The activation of the active site may result from a conformational change in the enzyme induced by C-terminal peptide binding to this putative regulatory site. This observation that the C terminus of IκB-α activates the IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation of the N terminus can be used to reconcile the variable dissociation constants measured for the N-terminal peptide. For instance, when the N-terminal peptide was used as a substrate in the absence of the C-terminal peptide, aK m of 140 ± 28 μm was determined. When the N-terminal peptide was used as an inhibitor of C-terminal peptide phosphorylation, a considerably smaller dissociation constant (apparent K I ) of 12 ± 2 μm was obtained. This is consistent with the C-terminal peptide increasing the affinity of the enzyme for the N-terminal peptide. In addition, the data represented in Fig. 2 can be used with the K I determined for the C-terminal peptide to estimate a dissociation constant (K I ) of 43 ± 27 μm for the N-terminal peptide when used as an inhibitor of IκB-α phosphorylation. This dissociation constant for the N-terminal peptide is also smaller than the K m value of 140 μm because the C terminus of IκB-α is able to activate the IKK to bind the N-terminal peptide. Although the apparent K m for the N-terminal peptide in the absence of the C-terminal peptide is 140 μm, the apparent K m in the presence of the C-terminal peptide is reduced to a value of 21 μm (Table I). In fact, this apparent K m in the presence of the C-terminal peptide is an overestimate of the “true” dissociation constant under these conditions. This is because the C-terminal peptide is competitively inhibiting the binding of the N-terminal peptide at the active site even though C-terminal binding to the putative regulatory site is enhancing N-terminal peptide binding. Thus, the value of the true dissociation constant (K m ) for the N-terminal peptide is approximately 4 μm when activated by C-terminal peptide binding to a regulatory site (i.e. K m app = K m (1 + [I]/K I ), where [I] andK I equal the concentration and active-site dissociation constant, respectively, of the C-terminal peptide (21Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman & Sons, New York1985: 107-109Google Scholar)). Therefore, the presence of the C-terminal peptide increases the apparent second-order rate constant (k cat/K m ) for the phosphorylation of the N-terminal peptide by a factor of at least 160 as compared with the value in the absence of the C-terminal peptide (i.e., 291/4 versus64/140). The V max values for N-terminal peptide phosphorylation were plotted at various C-terminal peptide concentrations to give a hyperbolic dependence (Fig.7). This implies that the dissociation constant for the binding of the C-terminal peptide to the regulatory site is approximately 1 μm. Thus, binding of the C terminus to this putative regulatory site may provide most of the overall free energy of binding of IκB-α to the enzyme. Moreover, this model may account for the specificity of phosphorylation of IκB-α at Ser-32/Ser-36 because activation of the active site would only occur when the C terminus of IκB-α is bound to the enzyme. In fact, when the C terminus of IκB-α is bound to the regulatory site, the N terminus may then be optimally positioned to interact with the now-activated active site. This finding that the IKK recognizes and is activated by the C terminus of IκB-α also has important ramifications for our understanding of both the regulation of the degradation of IκB-α and the activation of NF-κB. Indeed, the presence and phosphorylation state of the C terminus of IκB-α has been shown to play a role in the signal-induced degradation of IκB-α (22Beauparlant P. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol.

An analogous C-terminal region rich in proline, glutamate, aspartate, serine, and threonine residues (termed the PEST domain) has also been identified in IκB-β (8Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A.

Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent report has indicated that recombinantly transferring the C terminus (along with the N terminus) of IκB-α to an unrelated protein, such as GST, enables GST to be phosphorylated and degraded in a signal-responsive way (27Brown K.

We have investigated whether TGF-β1 action on human BM stromal cells affected the adhesion of progenitor cells involving integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5.

Little is known about the effects of TGF-β on stromal cell function. Potential targets for its action include the control of cell proliferation and the regulation of the synthesis of adhesion elements, such as extracellular matrix proteins, and extracellular matrix protein-degrading proteases (14Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). Changes in the expression of adhesion elements on BMSC at different niches or during different stages of differentiation could result in variations in the adhesion of maturing precursor cells and could also influence the localization of tumor cells in the BM. In this work, we have studied the involvement of integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 in progenitor cell adhesion to TGF-β1-treated stroma. Normal BM was obtained after informed consent from donors for allogeneic bone marrow transplants. Multiple myeloma BM samples were obtained from untreated patients with active disease. The stromal cultures were generated as described previously (13Robledo M.M. Hidalgo A. Lastres P. Arroyo A.G. Bernabeu C. Sánchez-Madrid F. Teixidó J. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium) and 10−5m hydrocortisone sodium succinate. Non-adherent cells were removed after 1 week, and upon confluency, the stromal cells were passaged by trypsin/EDTA. After four passages, they were seeded 1 week before use in 96-well plates for adhesion and cell ELISAs. Our BM stromal monolayers consisted mainly of fibroblasts and macrophages, with a low percentage of endothelial cells (13Robledo M.M. Hidalgo A. Lastres P. Arroyo A.G. Bernabeu C. Sánchez-Madrid F. Teixidó J. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The human bone marrow stromal cell line Str-5 was maintained in complete medium (13Robledo M.M. Hidalgo A.

For TGF-β1 treatments, stromal cultures were first incubated in IMDM supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and serum replacement medium (2× TCM, ICN Biomedicals) for 24 h, followed by a 24-h incubation in the same medium in the presence of recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom), and this medium was removed by aspiration before assays. The pre-B Nalm-6, myeloma NCI-H929, and Burkitt lymphoma Ramos cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol for the NCI-H929 cells). The multipotential cell line UT-7 (15Komatsu N. Nakauchi H. Miwa A. Ishihara T. Eguchi M. Moroi M. Okada M. Sato Y. Wada H. Yawata Y. Suda T. Miura Y.

TGF-β levels from stromal supernatants were determined in a bioassay by analyzing the growth inhibition of mink lung epithelial Mv1Lu cells (American Type Culture Collection CCL 64). Mv1Lu cells were subcultured in IMDM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 24-well tissue culture plates at 3 × 104 cells/well. TGF-β1 (0.1–10 ng/ml) or 24-h stromal supernatants in IMDM supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and 2× TCM were added without previous acidification to Mv1Lu cells in triplicates, which were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, the last 4 h in the presence of 1 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK). At the end of incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with 0.2 n NaOH, and extracts were neutralized with 1 m HCl before adding scintillation liquid and analyzed in a β-counter. Cell lines were labeled in their respective growth medium with the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) and finally resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin (adhesion medium). For cell adhesion to purified plasma fibronectin (Sigma), increasing concentrations of this ligand were coated overnight at 4 °C in 100 mm NaHCO3 (pH 8.8), followed by 2-h incubation at 37 °C and then blocking with 0.4% bovine serum albumin in the same solution for 2 h at 37 °C. Preincubations with antibodies were carried out at 37 °C for 15 min, and the antibodies were removed before adhesion. To untreated or TGF-β1-treated stroma or fibronectin in 96-well dishes (Falcon) was added 50 μl of adhesion medium 20 min before adhesion, and after removing it, labeled cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were incubated with the stroma or with fibronectin for 20 min at 37 °C. Unbound cells were removed by three washes with RPMI 1640 medium, and adherent cells were quantified using a fluorescence analyzer (CytoFluor 2300, Millipore Corp.). Untreated or TGF-β1-treated stromal monolayers were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline. After removing the blocking solution, cells were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with the primary antibodies, washed with Tris-buffered saline in the presence of 0.05% Tween 20, and further incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Monolayers were finally washed and incubated with ABTS (Boehringer Mannheim) in the dark before measuring in an ELISA reader (Multiskan Bichromatic, Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) at 405 nm. Preparation of the stromal cells for flow cytometry analysis was performed as described previously (13Robledo M.M. Hidalgo A. Lastres P. Arroyo A.G. Bernabeu C. Sánchez-Madrid F. Teixidó J. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Approximately 105 stromal cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of primary antibodies at 4 °C for 45 min. After washing, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig (Dako) was added and further incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Samples were analyzed using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. To investigate whether TGF-β1 action on BMSC could influence hematopoietic precursor and myeloma cell adhesion mediated by integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5, we first measured the levels of bioactive TGF-β present in primary human BMSC (HBM-Str) cultures, in the stromal cell line Str-5, and in multiple myeloma BMSC (MM-Str) cultures. Bioassays for TGF-β activity using the TGF-β responder cell line Mv1Lu showed TGF-β-dependent activity corresponding to 0.3–0.6 ng/ml in HBM-Str cells cultured for 24 h, whereas Str-5 and MM-Str cells secreted bioactive TGF-β in the range of 2–2.5 ng/ml (Fig. 1). Incubation of primary stroma with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 resulted in a decrease in the adhesion of the pre-B cell line Nalm-6 compared with the adhesion to untreated stroma (Fig.2 A). The anti-α4 HP1/2 mAb significantly inhibited (30–40%; p < 0.05) the adhesion of Nalm-6 cells to untreated stroma, but inhibition by HP1/2 was consistently decreased when the adhesion was performed on TGF-β1-incubated stroma. In contrast, the anti-α5 SAM-1 mAb minimally inhibited Nalm-6 cell adhesion to untreated stroma; however, incubation of stroma with TGF-β1 resulted in a blockade of cell adhesion by SAM-1, as well as by another anti-α5 mAb called P1D6 (data not shown), of ∼50% (p < 0.05) (Fig.2 A). The results of inhibition of Nalm-6 cell adhesion using a mixture of anti-α4 and anti-α5 mAbs mimicked those of inhibition with single mAbs. Thus, HP1/2 and SAM-1 together inhibited slightly better than HP1/2 alone the adhesion of Nalm-6 cells to untreated stroma (Fig. 2 A), reflecting a major VLA-4 use. After incubation of the stroma with TGF-β1, the combination of both antibodies inhibited similarly to SAM-1 alone, indicating a predominant VLA-5 utilization. The anti-VCAM-1 4B9 mAb inhibited by 15–20% the adhesion of Nalm-6 cells to either untreated or TGF-β1-treated stroma (Fig. 2 A). The effect of TGF-β1 action on Nalm-6 cell adhesion to HBM-Str was also evident when we preincubated the Str-5 cells with increasing concentrations of TGF-β1, although in this case, higher concentrations of the cytokine were needed to obtain a substantial blocking of Nalm-6 cell adhesion by the anti-α5 mAb (Fig.2 B). In parallel experiments, the SAM-1 and P1D6 mAbs did not inhibit the adhesion of the VLA-5-negative B cell line Ramos either to untreated or TGF-β1-treated HBM-Str cells (data not shown). As for the case of Nalm-6 cells, preincubation of HBM-Str cells with TGF-β1 resulted in a decrease in the adhesion of the multipotential cell line UT-7 (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, both HP1/2 and, to a lesser extent, SAM-1 inhibited the adhesion of UT-7 cells to untreated stroma. However, TGF-β1 treatment of the stroma resulted in a notable reduction in HP1/2 inhibition of cell adhesion, whereas inhibition by SAM-1 remained unchanged, indicating a predominant VLA-5 use. We could not observe any clear effect of the anti-VCAM-1 mAb on UT-7 cell adhesion to stroma, suggesting that VLA-4 on these cells mainly interacts with fibronectin. To study if the differential use of VLA-4 and VLA-5 could also be observed using leukemic BM stroma, we generated stromal cell cultures from multiple myeloma BM samples and analyzed the effect of their incubation with TGF-β1 on the adhesion of the myeloma-derived cell line NCI-H929. These monolayers expressed abundant fibronectin and substantial levels of VCAM-1 (data not shown). 2M. M. Robledo, F. Sanz-Rodriguez, A. Hidalgo, and J. Teixidó, manuscript in preparation. Similarly to Nalm-6 and UT-7 cells, NCI-H929 cells adhered significantly less to TGF-β1-treated compared with untreated multiple myeloma stroma (Fig.3). The anti-α4 HP1/2 mAb inhibited NCI-H929 cell adhesion to untreated stroma by ∼40% (p < 0.05) and to a lower extent after treatment with TGF-β1. As observed for Nalm-6 cells, a low degree of inhibition of NCI-H929 cell adhesion to untreated stroma was detected with the anti-α5 mAb P1D6, but after TGF-β1 incubation of the multiple myeloma stroma, a high induction of blocking by this antibody was obtained (Fig. 3). The anti-VCAM-1 4B9 mAb inhibited normally 15–25% of NCI-H929 cell adhesion to both untreated and TGF-β1-treated multiple myeloma stroma. One of the targets of TGF-β action is the control of extracellular matrix protein synthesis (14Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar, 20Ignotz R.A. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4337-4345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As fibronectin is expressed by stromal cells and is a ligand for both VLA-4 and VLA-5, we analyzed whether FN levels on the surface of stromal cells were affected by TGF-β1. Cellular ELISAs consistently showed an augmentation in FN deposition by HBM-Str cells in response to TGF-β1, as measured by antibodies against the FN central cell-binding domain and the CS-1-containing region (Fig. 4). These results were confirmed by [35S]Met/Cys metabolic labeling of stroma, where a 2.5-fold increase in gelatin-bound extracellular FN was observed upon TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 4). When the expression of VCAM-1 on stromal cells was analyzed by flow cytometry, a significant reduction was obtained in response to TGF-β1 (data not shown), similar to previous results (21Dittel B.N. McCarthy J.B. Wayner E.A. Le Bien T.W. Blood. 1993; 81: 2272-2282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same experiments showed no effect of TGF-β1 on VLA-β1 or CD11b expression on these cells. To investigate possible mechanisms underlying the potential preferential receptor usage, we carried out cell adhesion assays with increasing concentrations of human plasma fibronectin using Nalm-6 cells. The cells adhered to fibronectin in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of control P3 antibodies, reaching saturation at ∼30 μg/ml (Fig.5). The inhibition of Nalm-6 cell adhesion to fibronectin by anti-α4 and anti-α5 antibodies displayed three different patterns, depending on the concentrations of fibronectin used. At the lowest concentrations of FN (2–4 μg/ml), the anti-α4 HP1/2 mAb notably inhibited Nalm-6 cell adhesion, whereas the anti-α5 P1D6 mAb did not block, suggesting a predominant VLA-4 use (Fig. 5). When the concentration of FN was increased (8–12 μg/ml), HP1/2 showed no or modest inhibition of Nalm-6 cell adhesion, whereas P1D6 significantly inhibited this adhesion, indicating a preferential VLA-5 utilization. At the highest concentrations of fibronectin (>16 μg/ml), both P1D6 and HP1/2 inhibited Nalm-6 cell adhesion, although the former inhibited always to a higher extent (Fig.5). In the same experiments, a mixture of antibodies against the FN central cell-binding domain and the CS-1-containing region fully inhibited Nalm-6 cell adhesion when they were preincubated with the fibronectin-coated wells (data not shown), demonstrating the specificity of the adhesion. This study describes novel modulatory roles for TGF-β1 in the adhesion of hematopoietic precursor and myeloma cells to BM stroma. The important finding is that TGF-β1 action on human BMSC resulted in a significant reduction in the participation of VLA-4 in mediating precursor and myeloma cell adhesion to the stroma, linked to an increase in VLA-5 involvement in such adhesion. As shown in TableI, the ratio of VLA-5 versusVLA-4 utilization by Nalm-6 and UT-7 cells increased 10-fold after treatment of the stroma with TGF-β1, whereas this ratio was close to 5-fold in the case of NCI-H929 cells, as determined from values of inhibition of cell adhesion. The results were obtained using TGF-β1 concentrations similar to those found in the supernatants from normal and multiple myeloma stromata, although in UT-7 cells, slightly higher amounts of TGF-β1 were required. We detected lower levels of TGF-β in multiple myeloma stromal cultures compared with a previous report (11Urashima M. Ogata A. Chuhan D. Hatziyanni M. Vidriales M.B. Dedera D.A. Schlossman R.L. Anderson K.C. Blood. 1996; 87: 1928-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could be due to the different methods of measurement, as we analyzed bioactive TGF-β, whereas the other study used an ELISA. The differential effects on VLA-4- and VLA-5-mediated cell adhesion are likely at the attachment and possibly spreading levels, as we performed short adhesion assays (20 min), and thus, little, if any, cell migration took place in our system. In addition, it has been reported that most of VLA-4-mediated B cell precursor adhesion to stroma occurs in the first 15 min of cell attachment (22Patrick C.W. Juneja H.S. Lee S. Schmalstieg F.C. McIntire L.W. Blood. 1995; 85: 168-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, our results were obtained under conditions favoring VLA-4 activity. The modulation of VLA-4 and VLA-5 use by TGF-β1 treatment of stroma takes place in the absence of any exogenously added TGF-β1 in the precursor cell lines, and thus, it is independent of a possible increase in VLA-5 expression due to this cytokine, as has been reported for several cell types (23Heino J. Ignotz R.A. Hemler M.E. Crouse C. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bauvois B. Rouillard D. Sanceau J. Wietzerbin J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3912-3919PubMed Google Scholar).Table IEffect of treatment of BM stroma with TGF-β1 on the differential use of VLA-4 and VLA-5 by Nalm-6, UT-7, and NCI-H929 cellsCell lineα5/α4 ratio inhibition−/+TGF-β1 ratio−TGF-β1+TGF-β1Nalm-60.141.4010UT-70.525.2510NCI-H9290.462.164.7 Open table in a new tab Associated with the decreased implication of VLA-4 in mediating precursor and myeloma cell adhesion to TGF-β1-treated stroma, there was a reduction in adhesion to stroma. A diminished B cell precursor cell adhesion to stroma preincubated with TGF-β1 was also previously reported, which was linked to a reduced expression of VCAM-1 (21Dittel B.N. McCarthy J.B. Wayner E.A. Le Bien T.W. Blood. 1993; 81: 2272-2282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we observed a moderate participation of the VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion pathway in Nalm-6 and NCI-H929 cells, as detected by antibody inhibition of the adhesion, but this interaction was not reduced upon stroma treatment with TGF-β1, suggesting that other adhesion pathways might be affected. This suggests that most of the VLA-4-dependent precursor and myeloma cell adhesion to untreated stroma that we observed takes place by attachment to fibronectin. The data also indicate that the increase in VLA-5 involvement in cell adhesion to TGF-β1-treated stroma does not restore the reduced adhesion. The binding of TGF-β1 to the stroma resulted in an increase in the levels of fibronectin expressed on the surface of stromal cells. Although both the CS-1 and central cell-binding domains of FN were augmented by TGF-β1, the precursor and myeloma cells used predominantly VLA-5 to interact with FN on TGF-β1-treated stroma. To gain some insight into the mechanisms leading to the preferential use of VLA-5 after increased fibronectin deposition on BMSC by TGF-β1, we tested whether changes in the concentration of purified fibronectin could influence the integrins utilized to mediate cell adhesion. The results obtained in the lower and likely more physiological range of FN concentrations mimicked those from adhesion to TGF-β1-treated stroma. Thus, VLA-4 was the predominant receptor used at the lowest concentrations of FN inside this range, whereas VLA-5 was the preferential integrin utilized when the concentration of FN was increased. At high concentrations of fibronectin, VLA-5 use was still higher than VLA-4 use, although the latter retained considerable participation in adhesion to fibronectin. These results suggest that the concentrations of fibronectin modulate the receptor used to mediate cell adhesion, and therefore, TGF-β1 regulation of the expression levels of fibronectin on BMSC finely tunes the pattern of the integrins that will be used by the precursor and myeloma cells to interact with the stroma. The α4 integrins are required for normal development of both B and T precursor cells in bone marrow (25Arroyo A.G. Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1996; 85: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and long-term BM cultures have demonstrated the involvement of VLA-4 in lymphopoiesis (26Miyake K. Weissman I.L. Greenberger J.S. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), evidencing the importance of VLA-4-mediated adhesion during hematopoiesis. It is well established that VLA-4 and VLA-5 on stem and precursor cells as well as on several leukemic cells mediate attachment to their ligands on BMSC (2Teixidó J. Hemler M.E. Greenberger J.S. Anklesaria P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 3Ryan D.H. Nuccie B.L. Abboud C.N. Winslow J.M. J. Clin.

This interaction is important for the differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. For instance, VLA-4/FN interaction is required for terminal maturation of Ig-secreting BM cells (27Roldan E. Garcia-Pardo A. Brieva J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, VLA-4- and VLA-5-mediated cell adhesion to FN decreases the proliferation of both normal hematopoietic and chronic myelogenous leukemia progenitors (28Hurley R.W. McCarthy J.B. Verfaillie C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Lundell B.I. McCarthy J.B. Kovach N.L. Verfaillie C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2450-2458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been reported that VLA-5/FN interaction induces apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells (30Sugahara H. Kanakura Y. Furitsu T. Ishihara K. Oritani K. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Ishikawa J. Hashimoto K. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1757-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). TGF-β is present in the BM microenvironment, and it is conceivable that changing amounts of this cytokine in different niches of BM could influence the regulation of hematopoiesis. BMSC secrete TGF-β1 and have the TGF-β1 receptor system necessary for signaling by this cytokine (13Robledo M.M. Hidalgo A. Lastres P. Arroyo A.G. Bernabeu C. Sánchez-Madrid F. Teixidó J. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The differential use of VLA-4 and VLA-5 by progenitor and myeloma cells to adhere to stroma after binding of TGF-β1 to their receptors on the stromal cells suggests a mechanism by which changing adhesive interactions might lead to a modulation of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, the differential contribution of VLA-4 and VLA-5 to the mediation of myeloma cell attachment to multiple myeloma stroma could influence the localization and proliferation of the malignant plasma cells in bone marrow.

https://openalex.org/W2332422477,"Nuclear translocation has been documented for members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family in addition to their roles as extra-cellular signalling molecules. Fusing different parts of the chicken FGF-2 open reading frame to pyruvate kinase shows that direct nuclear accumulation is mediated by the amino-termini of the two leucine initiated FGF-2 isoforms (Leu-isoforms; 21.5 and 20.0 kDa). An evolutionarily conserved glycine-arginine (GR)-motif is present in the 21.5 kDa Leu-isoform and a shorter GR-repeat in the 20.0 kDa Leu-isoform, whereas no such repeats are present in the 18.5 kDa FGF-2 isoform (Met-isoform). Expression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts shows that the 21.5 kDa Leu-isoform is predominantly nuclear, whereas the Met-isoform is predominantly cytoplasmic. Most importantly, insertion of the GR-motif into the Met-isoform results in a protein with characteristics similar to the Leu-isoforms, as shown by nuclear accumulation of the chimeric MGR-protein. Furthermore, only NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing the Met-isoform proliferate under serum starvation conditions, whereas cells expressing either the MGR- or Leu-isoforms stay growth arrested. These studies show that the GR-signal mediates nuclear translocation of endogenous Leu-isoforms and blocks their mitogenic activity."

The chaperone effects of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system are based on the ability of DnaK to bind extended hydrophobic segments of proteins in a reversible manner and possibly to exert conformational work on them (2Martin J.

In a search for peptide mimetics that might be used as inhibitors of the chaperone system, we tested normal all- d and retro all- d (retro-inverso) analogs of a parentall- l peptide for binding to DnaK and DnaJ. In the normal all- d peptide mimetics, alll-amino acid residues have been replaced by the corresponding d-enantiomers; the main chains of these peptide analogs have the same direction as in the parent peptides, whereas the side chains occupy enantiomorphic positions. In contrast, retro all- d peptides, i.e.mimetic peptides of d-amino acids with, as compared with the reference l-peptides, reverse sequence, exhibit in extended conformation the same side chain topology as their native counterparts (15Chorev M. Goodman M. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 438-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In certain cases they may therefore retain the biological activity of the reference l-peptides while being much less susceptible to proteolytic degradation (16Binkirane N. Guichard G.

The similar all- lpeptide a-p5′ (CALLLSAARR), which binds to DnaK with aK d of 0.1 μm (not shown), was used as reference peptide in this study. Addition of DnaJ to normal all- d a-p5′ and retro all- d a-p5′′ (for the structures of the peptides, see Table I) resulted in an increase in fluorescence and a shift in the emission maximum from 526 nm to 520 nm, indicating binding of these peptides (Fig.1). Similar binding-induced changes in fluorescence were observed with all- l a-p5 and all- l a-p5′ (Table I), suggesting that the acrylodan-labels of DnaJ-boundnormal all- d a-p5′ and retro all- d a-p5′′ are located in an environment similar to that of the DnaJ-bound all- lpeptides. In contrast, addition of DnaJ to retro all- d p5′-a, which has the fluorophore attached to its C-term, shifted the fluorescence maximum to 490 nm. This more pronounced blue shift (Fig. 2) is an exception among all peptides tested and suggests that the acrylodan label of retro all- d p5′-ais situated at the opposite site of the peptide-binding region of DnaJ (Table I). This interpretation implies that retro all- d p5′-a, as the other testedd-peptides, binds with the same peptide backbone direction as the l-peptides. All- l andnormal all- d peptides were bound in a biphasic process, while the binding of both retro all- dpeptides could be fitted to single-exponential functions (Fig.1). The two retro all- d peptides are the most strongly binding ligands; normal all- d a-p5′ binds with lower affinity, similar to that ofall- l a-p5′ (Table I). For comparison, the 17-residue N-terminal peptide of rhodanese has been reported to bind with a K d < 20 nm to DnaJ but not to DnaK (23Kudlicki W. Odom O.W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31160-31165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We used this high affinity peptide ligand to check the specificity of binding of the tested d-peptides. Addition of 4 μm unlabeled rhodanese peptide to preformed complexes of normal all- d a-p5′ andretro all- d p5′-a with DnaJ (conditions as described in the legend to Fig. 1, except that 1.5 μm DnaJ was used) decreased the fluorescence signal of the DnaJ-bound labeled peptides in a time-dependent process (not shown); however, for yet unknown reasons, the fluorescence signal was not abolished completely. Apparently, the rhodanese peptide and thed-peptides bind at least in part to the same site. The hydrophobic acrylodan label itself seems to contribute only little to the binding; the K d value of acrylodan-labeled 2-mercaptoethanol proved to be > 800 μm. 3E. V.

Open table in a new tab Figure 2Fluorescence titration of the acrylodan-labeled retro all- d p5′ with DnaJ. Retro all- d p5′-a (50 nm) in assay buffer (— — —) was titrated with increasing concentrations of DnaJ, and emission spectra were recorded after reaching equilibrium (——). Inset, the titration curve was obtained by plotting the differences in fluorescence at 490 nm against the total DnaJ concentration and fitting these data points to the following nonlinear regression equation: ΔF = (ΔF max/2 × L t) × {(L t + P t +K d) − [(Lt +P t +Kd) 2 −(4 ×Lt ×P t)]0.5}, where ΔF is the change in relative fluorescence, L t is the total concentration of acrylodan-labeled peptide, andP t is the total concentration of DnaJ.

The IC50 value,i.e. the concentration at which the d-peptides inhibited binding of a-p5′ to 50%, was 0.6 μmand 2.2 μm for the retro all- dand the normal all- d peptide, respectively. The K i values were calculated, assuming competitive inhibition, with Equation 1 (24Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem.

The K i for the retro all- danalog (0.6 μm) proved to be virtually the same as its IC50 value and close to the K d of its acrylodan-labeled derivative determined by fluorescence titration (0.9 μm). In the case of the normal all- d peptide, the calculated K i (2.2 μm) was identical with the IC50 value and of the same order of magnitude as the K d value obtained by titration (6.8 μm). Apparently, thed-peptides bind to the same site in DnaJ asall-l a-p5′. On addition of DnaK to the acrylodan-labeledd-analogs we did not observe any fluorescence changes, probably reflecting a very low affinity of the chaperone for the pseudo-peptides (not shown). The stimulation of the ATPase activity by peptide ligands offers an additional possibility to examine the interaction of DnaK with potential ligands (20Feifel B. Sandmeier E. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Jordan R. McMacken R. J. Biol.

Thenormal and the retro all- d peptide p5′ only weakly stimulated DnaK ATPase by a factor of 1.3, as compared with the 3.5-fold stimulation in the case of the referencel-peptide (Table II), again indicating only a weak interaction between d-peptides and DnaK. This notion was confirmed by a gel filtration experiment with radioactively labeled peptides. As a representative of thed-analogs we used *NEM-labeled normal all- d p5′ and as a positive control for DnaK binding *NEM-labeled peptide p6 which is known to be a high affinity ligand of DnaK (K d in the micromolar range 4S. M. Gisler, E. V. Pierpaoli, H.-J. Schönfeld, and P. Christen, manuscript in preparation.). After preincubation of DnaK and peptides for 2 h, the DnaK-peptide complex was separated from unbound ligand by Superose 12 chromatography. In thed-peptide experiment, DnaK eluted without radioactivity; apparently, the interaction between DnaK and the d-analog is too weak to be detected by gel filtration. In the control experiment, DnaK-containing fractions showed radioactivity, indicating formation of a stable complex (not shown).Table IIStimulation of DnaK ATPase by DnaJ in the presence and absence of peptidesPeptideConcentrationDnaJk catμmmin −1None−0.03Retro all- d p5′50−0.04Normal all- d p5′50−0.04Normal all- l p5′50−0.11None+1.9Retro all- dp5′50+1.9Retro all- dp5′150+2.6Normal all- dp5′150+0.82Normal all- lp5′150+0.23 Open table in a new tab The rate of steady-state ATP hydrolysis of DnaK is stimulated by DnaJ up to 200-fold (2Martin J.

Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because thed-peptides bind to DnaJ but not to DnaK, we investigated their effect on the ability of DnaJ to stimulate the steady-state ATPase activity of DnaK (Table II). We preincubated DnaJ with saturating concentrations of peptides, then added DnaK plus GrpE and followed the generation of ADP. Peptide retro all- dp5′ slightly stimulated the ATPase activity in the presence of DnaJ. The binding of retro all- d p5′ without concomitant inhibition of DnaK ATPase indicates that the co-chaperone DnaJ possesses two separate binding sites for peptides and DnaK.Normal all- d p5′ and all-lp5′ markedly decreased the DnaJ-stimulated ATPase activity of DnaK to 44% and 12%, respectively, of the activity in the absence of peptide (Table II). It remains to be explored whether this inhibitory effect is due to direct binding of these peptides to the DnaK recognition site of DnaJ or to an allosteric effect caused by binding to the peptide-binding site that hinders or prevents interaction with DnaK. 1) In contrast to DnaK, DnaJ recognizes peptide-mimetics that are composed exclusively of d-amino acids. For DnaK, neither the identical positions of the side chains in the case of retro all- d analogs nor the same direction of the peptide backbone (normal all- dpeptide) suffice to mimic the reference peptide p5′. Interactions with both the peptide backbone and the side chains seem to limit the binding capacity strictly to l-peptides. DnaJ, however, seems to be less exacting with respect to the spatial orientation of side chains of the target peptide. All testedl- and d-peptides were recognized as ligands, binding with different spectral and kinetic features. 2) Spectral differences between DnaJ complexes of peptide retro all- d p5′-a that has the fluorophore attached to the C-term and the other peptides (Table I) suggest that retro all- d p5′-a binds with unchanged backbone direction and thus, like normal all- d a-p5′, with enantiomorphic side chain positions. 3) The peptidesall- l a-p5′, normal all- d a-p5′, and retro all- d p5′-a differentially inhibit DnaJ in stimulating the DnaK ATPase activity, i.e. the extent of DnaJ-induced ATPase activity of DnaK depends on the nature of the DnaJ-bound peptide ligand. 4) DnaJ apparently possesses two binding sites, one for polypeptides, binding all- l as well asall-d peptides, and one for interaction with DnaK. Upon binding of peptides, DnaJ may control the action of the DnaK system by means of an allosteric regulation of its DnaK-interaction site. We thank A. Baici and E. Sandmeier for helpful discussions, H. Gehring and E. Pierpaoli for critical review of this manuscript, and P. Hunziker for amino acid analysis and mass spectral analysis of the peptides."

Its glycosylation was found to change dramatically during the advancement of pregnancy. In this study, we have analyzed these glycosylation changes in five normal pregnancies. Binding to Lens culinaris lectin increased dramatically in all subjects between weeks 14 and 17 from the last menstrual period, indicating more core fucosylation as well as possible changes in branching of glycans. Studies using Datura stramonium agglutinin confirmed that the type of triantennary branching changed in this period of pregnancy. The precise structural nature of these changes was determined by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Amounts of core fucosylation and of triantennary glycans increased substantially from early to late second trimester, and a shift was observed from 1→4/1→3- toward predominantly 1→6/1→6-branched triantennary structures. The glycosylation changes occurred in all five individuals at the same time period in gestation, suggesting developmental regulation ofN-acetylglucosaminyltransferases IV and V and α6-fucosyltransferase during normal pregnancy. These enzymatic activities also appear to be affected in malignant transformation of the trophoblast. Our findings have important implications for the proposed use of specific forms of glycosylation as markers for cancer, as the relative amounts of these glycans in normal pregnancy will be determined by gestational age.

Glycoprotein hormone α subunit is common to the heterodimeric hormones chorionic gonadotropin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. However, in its free form (free α subunit), it is an important placental (1Ashitaka Y. Nishimura R. Futamura K. Ohashi M. Toyo S. Endocrinol.

Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2788-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Blithe D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21951-21956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The combination of α and β for heterodimer formation takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum prior to processing of the immature glycans. In α subunits that have not combined with a β subunit, enzymes from the post-translational glycosylation machinery have access to substrate sites that are normally protected by the β subunit of the heterodimer. As a result, the free form of α subunit generally contains more elaborate oligosaccharide branching as well as higher amounts of core fucosylation than α subunit obtained from dissociated hormone (8Blithe D.L. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2788-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Blithe D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21951-21956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These characteristic glycosylation patterns prevent secreted free α subunits from combining with β subunits that might be encountered extracellularly, thus ensuring a population of free α molecules (9Blithe D.L.

The structural diversity of complex-type N-linked glycans is initiated by GlcNAc branching of the trimannosyl core and continues with the action of different glycosyltransferases that further extend these antennae (11Schachter H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Specifically, the activity ofN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IV initiates the 1→4/1→3-branch of complex glycans, whereas the action ofN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V initiates the 1→6/1→6-branch. In most human epithelial tissues, expression of 1→6/1→6-branching is low, whereas in malignancy, expression of this branch is increased, and the resulting oligosaccharides are considered to be significant markers of carcinoma (12Hakomori S.

Open table in a new tab It is our hypothesis that the expression of 1→4/1→3-branched glycans in early pregnancy reflects the implantation and placentation process during the invasion of trophoblast tissue. Consequently, glycosylation patterns of pregnancy-related glycoproteins should change concurrently with the decline of the invasiveness of trophoblast tissue during the early second trimester of normal pregnancy.

In addition, less highly charged isoforms of hCG were found in late pregnancy (30Wide L. Hobson B. Acta Endocrinol. 1987; 116: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and further studies of its electrophoretic mobility suggested that its glycosylation patterns change during the early second trimester of pregnancy (31Wide L.

In the present study, we have analyzed the glycan structures of free α from five individuals throughout their normal pregnancies to determine the exact nature of the glycosylation changes and to define the time in pregnancy at which they occur.

Conradt (Gesellschaft für Biotechnologische Forschung, Braunschweig, Germany). Neuraminidase (Vibrio cholerae) was obtained from Calbiochem. BSA (Pentex fraction V) was purchased from Miles Inc. (Kankakee, IL). Sephadex G-100 (superfine) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. LcH-agarose and DSA gel were purchased from E-Y Laboratories, Inc. (San Mateo, CA). Centricon-10 and Microcon-10 concentration devices were obtained from Amicon, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Intact hCG was assayed by RIA using a monoclonal antibody, A03C9 (Monoclonal Antibodies Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), with cross-reactivity for free α and β subunits estimated at 1.3 and 0.3%, respectively. Free β subunit was assayed by RIA using polyclonal antiserum SB6, with <0.6% cross-reactivity for hCG (33Vaitukaitis J.L. Braunstein G.D. Ross G.T. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1972; 113: 751-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Free α subunit was assayed by RIA using an α-specific monoclonal antibody (BioMerica, Newport Beach, CA). The cross-reactivity of hCG with the free α monoclonal antibody was <0.1% (34Thotakura N.R. Bahl O.P. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 35Whitcomb R.W. Sangha J.S. Schneyer A.L. Crowley W.F. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 2022-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Five healthy pregnant volunteers provided 24-h urine collections throughout their full-term uncomplicated pregnancies. A sample was removed from each 24-h urine collection and was assayed for hCG, free α, and creatinine. Free α was isolated as described previously (32Skarulis M.C. Wehmann R.E. Nisula B.C. Blithe D.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 75: 91-96PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially, each urine specimen was precipitated with 2 volumes of acetone at pH 5.5 and 4 °C, followed by centrifugation. The precipitates were resuspended in distilled water and dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium acetate for 72 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation. The supernatants from each sample were lyophilized and redissolved in water. If not all material dissolved, then the pellets were redissolved, dialyzed, and centrifuged as described above. The second set of supernatants of each sample was combined with the first. Free α was isolated from each sample by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 superfine column (1.6 × 100 cm) run in 0.2 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4) at 4 °C at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. Fractions of 2 ml were collected into tubes containing BSA (2 mg/tube) and assayed by RIA for free α subunit, free β subunit, and intact hCG, respectively. Fractions containing free α subunit were pooled and lyophilized. Prior to liberating free α-glycans, the free α samples were further purified by affinity chromatography on anti-α rabbit polyclonal IgG cross-linked to Sepharose, prepared and characterized as described previously (26Blithe D.L. Nisula B.C. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 2218-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Affinity resin was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.8) with partially purified free α and gently mixed in a closed tube (head over head) overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was poured into a column, and the unbound material was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline. The column was washed with 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 5.0) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5 mg/ml BSA, followed by washes with the same buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The tightly bound material was eluted with 2 mm sodium phosphate containing 30 mm NaCl and 20 mm HCl (pH 2.0), and the eluted fractions were immediately neutralized with diluted NaOH and assayed by RIA. The flow-through and wash fractions were checked for unbound free α, and if any was detected, the fractions were combined, concentrated, desalted, and reapplied. The affinity-purified free α fractions were pooled, lyophilized, reconstituted in water, and desalted using Centricon-10 devices. Samples from different time points throughout the second trimester of each individual pregnancy were subjected to affinity chromatography on LcH and DSA lectin columns. To ascertain that the columns were not initially overloaded with glycoproteins, materials from the unbound fractions were reapplied to fresh columns. Additional tests showed that no matrix effects from the eluent interfered with assays of free α in the various fractions. LcH-agarose columns (0.7 × 8.5 cm) were loaded with 1–2 μg of free α and run in LcH buffer (0.2 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.1% BSA, and 0.1% NaN3) at a flow rate of 14 ml/h at 4 °C. Unbound material was eluted with 10–12 column volumes of LcH buffer. Bound material was eluted with LcH buffer containing 0.1 mα-methyl-d-mannoside. All fractions were assayed by RIA for free α immunoreactivity. Prior to DSA lectin chromatography, the free α samples were desialylated. 1–2 μg of purified free α was solubilized in 200 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) containing 9 mm CaCl2 and 0.15 m NaCl and incubated with 150 milliunits of neuraminidase at 37 °C for 17 h. After incubation, the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with ammonium hydroxide, and if needed, the volume was reduced to ∼250 μl. Desialylated free α samples were loaded on DSA gel columns (0.7 × 29 cm) and were allowed to interact with the lectin by stopping the flow for 20 min. The column was run in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% NaN3 at a flow rate of 12 ml/h at 4 °C. Unbound and retarded material was collected in fractions of 2.3 ml and quantified by RIA. After each run, the column was regenerated with 3–5 column volumes of 0.1 m acetic acid (pH 3.7) containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% NaN3. The material recovered in the regeneration step contained typically <1.5% of the total free α sample. This amount did not differ between early or late pregnancy samples. Immunopurified free α samples were desialylated with neuraminidase, desalted, and concentrated using Microcon-10 concentrators. Subsequently, the samples were denatured by heating at 100 °C for 3–4 min in 0.2m sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 1% SDS and 0.1m β-mercaptoethanol, followed by addition of EDTA (final concentration of 10 mm), Nonidet P-40 (final concentration of 5%), and recombinant glycerol-free peptide-N 4-(N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F (25–100 units/mg of glycoprotein; Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h; a second aliquot of enzyme was added, and the incubation was continued for another 20 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitate was eliminated by centrifugation. The pellets were washed with methanol (containing 5% water) to remove residual trichloroacetic acid and detergent and examined for complete release of the carbohydrate chains by acid hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid, followed by monosaccharide analysis by HPAEC-PAD (36Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The liberated glycans in the supernatant were purified on a column (0.7 × 28 cm) of Bio-Gel P-4 (mesh 200–400) run in water at room temperature at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and the released glycans were pooled and lyophilized. Elution positions of the glycans were established with oligosaccharide standards, detected by hexose assay using phenol-sulfuric acid reagents (37Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41197) Google Scholar). The glycans were resolved by HPAEC-PAD on a CarboPac PA-100 column (0.4 × 25 cm; Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) and detected with an electrochemical detector (ED40) set in the “carbohydrate” waveform, controlled by a personal computer using PeakNet chromatography software (38Cooper G.A. Rohrer J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The column was eluted with 250 mm NaOH with a 10% gradient of 0.5 msodium acetate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Periodate oxidation of the glycans (39Linsley K.B. Chan S.Y. Chan S. Reinhold B.B. Lisi P.J. Reinhold V.N. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40Angel A.S. Nilsson B. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 587-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was performed by incubation in 9 mmNaIO4, buffered with 0.1 m sodium acetate at pH 5.5, for 3 days at 4 °C in the dark. The reaction was quenched with 3 μl of ethylene glycol and incubated overnight under the same conditions. The product was neutralized with 0.1 m NaOH, reduced by the direct addition of 5 mg of solid NaBD4, and kept at room temperature for an additional 16 h. Excess reducing agent was destroyed by the addition of 5 μl of acetic acid, and the solutions were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Borate was removed by repeated addition and drying with methanol. The samples were vacuum-desiccated overnight prior to methylation. Each preparation (1–2 μg) was dissolved in 200 μl of a NaOH/Me2SO suspension (41Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydrate Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). After 1 h at room temperature, 50 μl of methyl iodide was added, and the suspensions were left for 1 h at room temperature with occasional vortexing (39Linsley K.B. Chan S.Y. Chan S. Reinhold B.B. Lisi P.J. Reinhold V.N. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The methylated product was extracted by adding 1 ml of chloroform, and the suspensions were backwashed four times with 2–3 ml of 30% acetic acid. The chloroform layer was dried down and stored at −20 °C. ESI-MS was performed on a TSQ 700 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray ion source (Analytica Inc., Branford, CT). Samples were dissolved in methanol/water solutions (6:4, v/v) containing 0.25 mm NaOH and analyzed by syringe pump flow injection directly into the electrospray chamber through a stainless steel hypodermic needle at a flow rate of 0.85 μl/min. The voltage difference between the needle tip and the source electrode was −3.5 kV. Free α subunit was purified from 24-h urine collections throughout the pregnancies of five healthy individuals. In all individuals, the total amount of free α production increased as pregnancy progressed. Typical recovery achieved was 95% of the initial free α immunoreactivity. In all procedures, loss of material was minimized by adding small amounts of BSA to the eluent. BSA also prevented loss of highly purified free α on membranes of the devices used for desalting. Samples of free α taken throughout the second trimester of each pregnancy were analyzed by lectin affinity chromatography on columns containing LcH-agarose (Fig. 1) or DSA gel (Fig. 2). Binding of glycans to LcH requires a trimannosyl core containing free hydroxyls at the C-3 and C-4 positions of both α-linked Man residues as well as an additional fucose residue α1→6-linked to the Asn-linked GlcNAc (42Kornfeld K. Reitman M.L. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6633-6640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Often the α-linked Man residues of the trimannosyl core are substituted at the C-2 positions with antennae consisting of GlcNAc, Gal, and sialic acid. These branches are tolerated by LcH as well as substitution at C-6 of the α1→6-linked Man (1→6/1→6-branching). However, tri- and tetraantennary glycans containing substitution at C-4 of the α1→3-linked Man of the trimannosyl core (1→4/1→3-branching) do not bind to LcH. As gestational age advanced, the amount of free α that could bind to LcH increased in all five individuals: from 39.6 ± 5.2% in the early second trimester to 75.2 ± 3.0% in the late second trimester of pregnancy (Figs. 1 and3), with a mean difference of 35.6 ± 6.0% (p < 0.01). This increased binding reflects a change in the number of LcH-binding glycans on free α as pregnancy progressed. In all five individuals, these glycosylation changes began at about week 14 and were nearly completed by week 17 from LMP (Fig.3).Figure 2DSA affinity chromatography of dissociated hCGα subunit and of early and late pregnancy free α subunits.Immunopurified desialylated α samples were subjected to affinity chromatography on DSA gel.

Biochem. 1987; 167: 62-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DSA interacts more strongly with triantennary glycans containing 1→6/1→6-branches than with the isomeric 1→4/1→3-branched structures. Sialic acid interferes with binding to DSA; therefore, all samples were desialylated and desalted prior to analysis. hCGα, dissociated from dimeric hCG, does not contain any tri- or tetraantennary oligosaccharides (9Blithe D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21951-21956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Blithe D.L. Iles R.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 45Weisshaar G.

In contrast, 17.4 ± 4.5% of early pregnancy free α interacted with DSA (Figs. 2 and 3). As pregnancy progressed, the percentage of free α that could interact with DSA increased markedly to 51.3 ± 2.2% by late second trimester. The increase in the amount of free α interacting with DSA occurred in all five individuals, with a mean difference of 33.9 ± 5.0% (p < 0.01). These data suggest the presence of higher amounts of 1→6/1→6-branched glycans as pregnancy progresses. Furthermore, the changes occurred within the same time frame as those observed"
https://openalex.org/W2085301129,"The Ras signaling pathway is rapidly activated and then down-regulated following stimulation of multiple cell-surface receptors including the insulin receptor (IR). Much recent attention has focused on elucidating the mechanism of Ras inactivation following IR engagement. Previous data suggest that IR-mediated serine/threonine phosphorylation of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos correlates with its decreased affinity for the adapter protein Grb2. This phosphorylation-induced disassembly of the Grb2·Sos complex is thought to be responsible, at least in part, for diminishing Ras activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In this report, we confirm the causal relationship between Sos phosphorylation and Grb2/Sos dissociation. We then examine several putative phosphorylation sites of Sos that could potentially regulate this event. Since a number of reports suggest that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylates Sos, we generated a Sos mutant lacking all seven canonical phosphorylation sites for ERK. This mutant is a poor substrate of activated ERK in vitro and fails to undergo a change in its electrophoretic mobility following IR stimulation. It is, however, phosphorylated after IR stimulation when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Interestingly, the mutant protein still dissociates from Grb2 following insulin stimulation, suggesting that ERK is not the kinase responsible for regulating the stability of the Grb2·Sos complex.

This is initiated by receptor-mediated translocation of the complex formed by the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos and its adapter protein Grb2 to the proximity of the plasma membrane (3Skolnik E.Y.

Klarlund J.K. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1950-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound Sos then accelerates the GTP/GDP exchange rate of Ras, leading to Ras activation. Although it has been known for some time that IR-mediated Ras activation is a transient event (5Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the mechanism of how Ras is down-regulated following initial activation remains poorly understood. Recently, several groups have reported a correlation between Sos phosphorylation and the disassembly of the Grb2·Sos complex following growth factor receptor activation (5Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reactivating Ras directly correlates with the dephosphorylation of Sos and reassembly of the Grb2·Sos complex (10Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Together, these data provide a potential molecular basis for Ras inactivation, through the dynamic interaction of Grb2 with Sos. Although the importance of serine/threonine phosphorylation of Sos has become increasingly clear, the kinase(s) that is(are) responsible for this event has(have) not been identified convincingly. It is known, however, that Sos is phosphorylated at multiple residues (9Corbalan-Garcia S. Yang S.S. Degenhardt K.R. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell.

Additionally, there are data to suggest that Sos phosphorylation sites may vary in different cellular systems or following different stimuli (9Corbalan-Garcia S. Yang S.S. Degenhardt K.R. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Rozakis-Adcock M. Van der Geer P. Mbamalu G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1417-1426PubMed Google Scholar, 13Li Y.Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21625-21634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), adding another degree of complexity to the question of which are the physiologically relevant sites. For example, recent work has examined the sites of Sos phosphorylation in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated NIH3T3 cells (12Rozakis-Adcock M. Van der Geer P. Mbamalu G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1417-1426PubMed Google Scholar) and serum-stimulated COS-1 cells (9Corbalan-Garcia S. Yang S.S. Degenhardt K.R. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) by phosphopeptide mapping. Although both reports provide evidence to suggest that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is responsible for at least some of the phosphorylation events, none of the mapped sites corresponds with each other. Additionally, we have found that in contrast to these studies in COS or 3T3 cells, the activity of protein kinase C, but not ERK, is required for T cell receptor-induced phosphorylation of Sos in Jurkat leukemic T cells (14Zhao H. Li Y.-Y. Fucini R.V. Ross S.E. Pessin J.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21625-21634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin stimulation was observed to induce Sos phosphorylation through a MEK-dependent but ERK-independent pathway (15Holt K.H. Kasson B.G. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have determined that Sos phosphorylation is directly responsible for the decreased binding affinity between Grb2 and Sos. Although ERK can phosphorylate Sos at specific carboxyl-terminal serine/threonine acceptor sites, those phosphorylation events do not affect the interaction between Grb2 and Sos. Together these data suggest that although ERK may be a physiological kinase for Sos, its activity is not responsible for regulating the stability of the Grb2·Sos complex following IR engagement on CHO cells. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with human insulin receptor (CHO/IR cells) were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium-α supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (1000 units/ml), streptomycin (1000 units/ml), and glutamine (20 mm). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against Sos1 and monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the amino-terminal SH3 region of Grb2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). MAb M2 raised against the FLAG epitope was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 195–217 (carboxyl terminus) of Grb2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from Bio-Rad. Purified activated ERK was a gift of M. Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). GST-Grb2 fusion protein was produced inEscherichia coli and purified as described before (16Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Jackman J.K.

Insulin, calf intestinal phosphatase (P-3681) and myelin basic protein were obtained from Sigma. [32P]Orthophosphate was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. CHO/IR cells were serum-starved with serum-free medium at 37 °C for 3–4 h followed by stimulation with medium alone or medium containing 100 nminsulin at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 400 μmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 400 μm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min and collection of supernatants. In experiments where cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, CHO/IR cells were first starved with medium containing no serum or phosphate for 2 h. [32P]Orthophosphate (0.25 mCi/ml) was then added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h before stimulation and lysis as described above. Cellular lysates (2 mg of total cellular protein per condition) were incubated with 2 μg of polyclonal anti-Grb2 antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. 20 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was then added followed by incubation for another 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed 3 times with high salt washing buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 500 mm NaCl) followed by one wash with low salt buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mmNaCl). Samples were then dissolved in Laemmli's sample buffer, boiled, subjected to SDS-12% PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The top portion of the gel was probed with monoclonal anti-FLAG and the bottom portion with anti-Grb2 mAb followed by development by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA encoding mSos1 excluding the first 30 base pairs subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) was kindly provided by D. Bowtell (University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia) and served as a template for all of our Sos mutant constructs. For expression in CHO/IR cells, cDNAs were subcloned into pEF/FLAG, a modified version of the pEFBOS vector (gift of D. Cantrell, London, UK) (17Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) containing DNA sequence encoding the FLAG epitope tag followed byBamHI and XbaI cloning sites. To create a construct for expression of the carboxyl terminus of mSos1 (Sos.CT.WT), the PstI-KpnI fragment (codons 3254–4510) of mSos1 was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) to generate a 5′BamHI site (pBS/mSos1.CT). TheBamHI-KpnI fragment was then excised and ligated between the BamHI and XbaI sites of pEF/FLAG. To create a construct for expression of the amino-terminal 1073 amino acids of Sos (SosΔCT), a stop codon was introduced at codons 3257–3259 by single-stranded site-directed mutagenesis using Muta-Gene Phagemid In Vitro Mutagenesis KIT from Bio-Rad. The sequence of the primer is 5′-AGACATCCCACACCTCTC(G)T(C)AGA(C)AGGAGCCAAGAAAAATT-3′ containing a stop codon (underlined) within a novel XbaI site. The BamHI-XbaI (codons 1877–3256) andBamHI-BamHI (codons 31–1876) fragments of the mutagenized plasmid were then inserted sequentially between theBamHI and XbaI sites of pEF/FLAG to generate pEF/SosΔCT. To introduce point mutations in Sos.CT.WT, in vitro mutagenesis was carried out as described above using pBS/mSos1.CT as template. The following primers were used: 5′-CCAAACTCCCCTCGGG(A)CCCCACTGACGCCG-3′ for replacing Thr-1102 with alanine (Sos.CT.T1102A); 5′-TCTGCACCAAACG(T)CCCCTCGGG(A)CCCCACTGG(A)CGCCGCCCCCTGCA-3′ for the generation of Sos.CT.3A replacing Ser-1099, Thr-1102, and Thr-1105 with alanines; 5′-GCCTTCTTCCCAAACG(A)GG(C)CCC(A, silent mutation)TCCCCTTTTG(A)CACCGCCACCCCCCCAAG(A)CCCCCTCTCCTCATGGC-3′ for replacing Ser-1255 with glycine and Thr-1260 and 1266 with alanines; 5′-TCAGATCCTCCTGAAG(A)GG(C)CCC(T, silent mutation)CCCTTGTTACCACCA-3′ was used to mutate Ser-1214 into glycine. The last three mutants were utilized to generate the hepta-mutant Sos.CT.VII by further subcloning. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and mutants were subsequently cloned into pEF/FLAG using the same strategy described for the construction of pEF/Sos.CT.WT. CHO/IR cells were transfected following protocols described by Yamauchi and Pessin (18Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, CHO/IR cells cultured to full confluency were detached with trypsin/EDTA and washed 3 times with 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without CaCl2 and MgCl2 (D-PBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at room temperature. Cells were then resuspended in D-PBS at a concentration of ∼3 × 107/ml and electroporated using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) with 40–100 μg of CsCl double-banded plasmid DNA at 340 V and 960 microfarads in 500 μl of D-PBS. Following electroporation, cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium-α supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 40–48 h before serum-starved and stimulated for analysis as described above. CHO/IR cells were transfected with 80 μg of cDNA encoding either Sos.CT.WT or Sos.CT.VII. Two days following transfection, cells were lysed and subjected to anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. One-half of the precipitate was analyzed by Western blot with anti-FLAG antibody to assess expression of the transfected construct. The remaining sample was washed 3 × with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP) and then resuspended in 40 μl of this buffer with or without purified activated ERK in the presence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 20 min and then terminated by the addition of 2× Laemmli loading buffer. Immune complexes were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In vitro phosphorylation of myelin basic protein served as a control. Cellular lysates (0.5 mg of total protein), prepared as described above, were incubated with purified GST-Grb2 fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (2 μg, 25-μl bed volume) for 1 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. In experiments where cell lysates were treated with alkaline phosphatase before being subjected to a GST-Grb2 binding assay, whole cell lysates were prepared as described above in lysis buffer containing 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmZnCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cellular lysates were then incubated in the absence (control) or presence of calf intestinal phosphatase (∼1 × 104 units, Sigma, P-3681) at room temperature for 1 h before GST-Grb2 was added. It has been shown previously by several laboratories that insulin stimulation results in both the serine/threonine phosphorylation of Sos and its dissociation from Grb2 (5Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K.

However, these prior studies had not demonstrated whether Sos phosphorylation was related causally to its decreased affinity for Grb2. We approached this question by asking if treatment of cell lysates with alkaline phosphatase would prevent the destabilization of the Grb2·Sos complex after insulin stimulation of CHO/IR cells. As shown in Fig.1, engagement of the IR on CHO/IR cells leads to decreased mobility of Sos by SDS-PAGE (compare lanes 1 and 2). This correlates with decreased affinity of Sos for a GST-Grb2 fusion protein (compare lanes 5 and6). As expected, when lysates were treated with alkaline phosphatase (lanes 3 and 4) the insulin-induced electrophoretic mobility shift was completely abrogated. Additionally, as shown in lanes 7 and 8, when Sos is dephosphorylated in this manner, insulin stimulation fails to induce a reduction in affinity between Grb2 and Sos. These data confirm that the electrophoretic mobility shift of Sos is due to its phosphorylation and demonstrate further that it is phosphorylation of Sos following IR engagement which leads to its decreased affinity for Grb2. To begin to examine the phosphorylation sites of Sos responsible for regulating its affinity for Grb2, we first sought to identify a smaller region of Sos which would be more easily manipulated, yet would contain all of the information necessary for insulin-induced modification leading to Grb2 dissociation. Fig.2 A shows schematically two of the more informative mutants we constructed. Sos.CT.WT is a variant which contains an amino-terminal epitope tag (FLAG) followed by the carboxyl-terminal 264 amino acids of Sos, previously shown to include the Grb2-binding site. SosΔCT is a variant that also contains the FLAG epitope at its amino terminus followed by the first 1073 amino acids of Sos with a stop codon engineered exactly where Sos.CT.WT Sos begins. CHO/IR cells were transfected with either Sos.CT.WT or SosΔCT and then left unstimulated or stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 30 min. Lysates were prepared from the transfected cells and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both constructs are expressed at high levels after transient transfection into CHO/IR cells. Insulin stimulation results in an electrophoretic mobility shift of Sos.CT.WT (compare lanes 1 and 2), whereas engagement of the IR fails to induce a change in migration of SosΔCT (lanes 3 and 4). Treatment of cell lysates with alkaline phosphatase demonstrates that the multiple bands seen in cells transfected with the Sos.CT.WT are differentially phosphorylated forms of the protein (data not shown). Although these multiple phosphorylated forms appear to a small extent in unstimulated cells, they are markedly more prominent following IR engagement. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 2 C, we compared the affinity of the Sos.CT.WT mutant for Grb2 before and after IR engagement. As shown, this variant of Sos behaves similarly to the full-length molecule in that insulin stimulation results in a marked reduction in Grb2 binding affinity. Furthermore, SosΔCT was completely unable to bind to GST-Grb2 with or without insulin pretreatment (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that the mutant containing only the carboxyl-terminal 264 amino acids of Sos serves as a reliable surrogate for the full-length molecule, and its use is therefore appropriate for examining the regulatory role of phosphorylation on the affinity of Sos for Grb2. Next we employed site-directed mutagenesis to target specific residues within Sos.CT.WT to dissect further the sites of Sos phosphorylation critical for regulating the stability of the Grb2·Sos complex following insulin stimulation. Work from several laboratories using in vitrokinase assays and phosphopeptide mapping techniques suggested that ERK may function as a physiologically important kinase for Sos (9Corbalan-Garcia S. Yang S.S. Degenhardt K.R. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Warne P.H. Downward J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1327-1331PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis reveals seven canonical ERK phosphorylation sites present within the carboxyl terminus of Sos (Fig.3 A) based on the reported consensus sequence proline-X-serine/threonine-proline (PX(S/T)P, where X is any amino acid) (20Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of Sos carboxyl-terminal mutants were therefore generated by altering these residues (shown schematically also in Fig.3 A). Sos.CT.T1102A has a single threonine to alanine mutation at amino acid 1102, and Sos.CT.3A has two additional alterations to alanines at serine 1099 and threonine 1105. The third mutant, Sos.CT.VII, has all seven of the consensus phosphorylation sites for ERK mutated to either alanine or glycine. Each mutant construct was transfected into CHO/IR cells to examine the effect of these mutations on electrophoretic mobility before and after insulin stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3 B, mutation of a single amino acid significantly alters the migration pattern of the carboxyl terminus of Sos in unstimulated CHO/IR cells as the Sos.CT.T1102A mutant resolves as a series of rapidly migrating bands by SDS-PAGE in cells incubated in medium alone (compare lanes 1 and 3). This observation suggests that wild type Sos may be phosphorylated in the basal state on Thr-1102. Interestingly, this residue has also been suggested to be a site of phosphorylation following EGF-induced ERK activation in NIH3T3 cells (12Rozakis-Adcock M. Van der Geer P. Mbamalu G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1417-1426PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, however, mutation of Thr-1102 alone is not sufficient to eliminate insulin-induced phosphorylation of Sos as this mutant exhibits a significant change in mobility following IR engagement (compare lanes 3 and4). When two additional sites are altered (in Sos.CT.3A), the IR-mediated mobility shift remains largely unaffected (lanes 5 and 6), although, as expected, there is an increase in the basal migration rate in unstimulated cells. In contrast, Sos.CT.VII exhibits a drastically diminished insulin-induced mobility shift (lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that mutation of the seven canonical ERK sites significantly affects IR-induced phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal region of Sos. To ensure that all potential ERK phosphorylation sites in Sos. CT.VII were eliminated, we performed a series of in vitro kinase assays shown in Fig. 4. Sos.CT.WT, Sos.CT.3A, and Sos.CT.VII constructs were transfected transiently into CHO/IR cells. Since each mutant has an amino-terminal FLAG epitope, and each protein could be immunoprecipitated selectively with anti-FLAG mAb. Immune complexes were incubated with activated ERK in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. As a control, incubation of myelin basic protein with the active ERK resulted in its expected phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). As shown, while Sos.CT.WT (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) and Sos.CT.3A (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) are phosphorylated in this in vitro assay, mutation of all canonical ERK sites in Sos.CT.VII eliminates the ability of purified ERK to phosphorylate the mutant (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). As shown in Fig. 4 B, this difference in ERK-dependent phosphorylation is not due to difference in the amount of Sos protein in each of the immunoprecipitates. Following identification of ERK phosphorylation sites within the carboxyl-terminal region of Sos, we predicted that mutation of all of these sites would abrogate insulin-induced Grb2/Sos dissociation. To test this prediction, we transfected CHO/IR cells with FLAG-tagged full-length wild type Sos cDNA (Sos.WT) or a construct including the seven mutations described above (Sos.VII). Consistent with experiments utilizing Sos.CT.VII, elimination of the seven canonical ERK phosphorylation sites in the context of the full-length molecule increases its basal migration rate by SDS (5–10% gradient)-PAGE (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 1 and 3). Additionally, as expected from the data making use of the carboxyl-terminal fragment (Fig.3 B), insulin stimulation fails to induce a shift in migration of Sos.VII (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 3and 4). Next, we compared the effect of insulin stimulation on the affinity of the transiently expressed Sos proteins toward Grb2. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 30 min followed by lysis and immunoprecipitation with anti-Grb2 antibody. To our surprise, both Sos.WT (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and2) and Sos.VII (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and4) still dissociate from Grb2 following insulin stimulation. Immunoblotting with anti-Grb2 demonstrated equal immunoprecipitation of Grb2 under these conditions (Fig. 5 C). Thus, elimination of all of the ERK sites described does not impact on the ability of IR engagement to induce instability of the Grb2·Sos complex. Since we showed that the insulin-induced Grb2/Sos dissociation depends on Sos phosphorylation (Fig. 1), we were surprised by our finding that mutation of residues that eliminate the IR induced electrophoretic mobility shift, and the ability of ERK to phosphorylate Sos in vitro did not affect the ability of insulin to alter the affinity of Sos for Grb2 (Fig. 5). One potential explanation for these observations is that other phosphorylation site(s) exist(s) which does (do) not impact on the apparent migration rate of Sos by SDS-PAGE and yet is (are) responsible for the decreased affinity of Sos toward Grb2. Additionally, it is likely that these sites are phosphorylated by a kinase other than ERK. To address if Sos.CT.VII is still phosphorylated inducibly in CHO/IR cells, we performed transient transfections of this construct or Sos.CT.WT into cells that were then incubated with [32P]orthophosphate prior to stimulation with insulin. Lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG and immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.6 A, insulin stimulation leads to increased phosphorylation of Sos.CT.WT (compare lanes 1and 2). Consistent with our hypothesis, Sos.CT.VII also demonstrates increased phosphorylation upon IR engagement (comparelanes 3 and 4). In addition, in agreement with our finding that at least some of the seven mutated sites are phosphorylated in cells basally, we found that Sos.CT.WT is phosphorylated to a greater extent than Sos.CT.VII in resting cells (compare lanes 1 and 3). To confirm that the differences seen using the carboxyl-terminal constructs reflect the biology of full-length Sos, similar in vivo labeling experiments were performed utilizing Sos.WT and Sos.VII. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 B, both Sos.WT (comparelane 1 with lane 2) and Sos.VII (comparelane 3 with lane 4) show an insulin-dependent increase in phosphorylation. The extent of phosphorylation was quantified by densitometric analysis (Fig.6 C). As shown, the degree of phosphorylation of Sos.VII is at least 2-fold lower than that of the wild type molecule in both resting and stimulated CHO/IR cells (note that there is slightly more Sos.VII expressed than Sos.WT by Western analysis (Fig. 6 B, compare lanes 5 and 6)). These data suggest that at least some of the canonical ERK phosphorylation sites contribute to the basal as well as induced phosphorylation of Sos in vivo. Thus, together with the data shown in Fig. 5, the results from these experiments support further the observation that although ERK may act on Sos in vivo, this kinase is not critical for IR-induced Grb2/Sos dissociation in CHO/IR cells. In many systems it is clear that activation of the Ras signaling pathway plays a critical role in effector functions following cell-surface receptor engagement (1Burgering B.M. Medema R.H.

Although much has been learned about the molecular mechanisms by which numerous receptors couple to Ras leading to its activation, little is yet known about the details of how Ras signaling is terminated. In some systems, it appears that modulation of Ras GTPase activating protein function plays a role in Ras inactivation (27Pomerance M. Schweighoffer F. Tocque B. Pierre M. J. Biol.

Several studies have demonstrated that engagement of the IR leads to phosphorylation of Sos which correlates with instability of the Grb2·Sos complex (5Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R.

In this report we first provide evidence that it is Sos phosphorylation that is causal in the dissociation of the Grb2·Sos complex following IR binding. Although numerous studies have shown that receptor engagement leads to Sos phosphorylation, the kinase(s) responsible for this event remains obscure. Several lines of investigation suggest that ERK may play a role in the regulation of Sos phosphorylation. It has been shown that Sos can be phosphorylated by ERK in vitro (11Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that mapping of Sos phosphorylation sites following EGF receptor ligation in NIH3T3 cells (12Rozakis-Adcock M. Van der Geer P. Mbamalu G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1417-1426PubMed Google Scholar) or COS-1 cells (29Porfiri E. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5871-5877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) indicates that Sos is phosphorylated on sites that are compatible with ERK being the kinase. However, it had not been shown whether it is ERK that is responsible for the phosphorylation of Sos leading to the decreased affinity for Grb2. We approached this question first by generating truncation mutants of Sos to determine if a smaller region of Sos could be defined which contains all of the information necessary for regulated Grb2 binding. We determined that a Sos mutant containing the carboxyl-terminal 264 amino acids binds to Grb2 in unstimulated CHO/IR cells. Following IR engagement Sos.CT.WT becomes phosphorylated, shifts its electrophoretic mobility by SDS-PAGE, and loses its affinity for Grb2. Interestingly, the only canonical ERK phosphorylation sites found in Sos fall within this carboxyl-terminal region. We therefore targeted these sites for mutagenesis to determine if phosphorylation on these residues is critical for IR-induced phosphorylation and Grb2/Sos dissociation. We examined a number of Sos mutants that included alterations of individual or multiple canonical ERK sites. We found that mutation of a single residue, Thr-1102, has profound effects on the migration of Sos.CT.WT under basal conditions suggesting that this residue is phosphorylated in intact cells. Our data suggest further, however, that there are other insulin-induced phosphorylation sites within the carboxyl-terminal region of Sos since Sos.CT.T1102A undergoes a marked shift in electrophoretic migration following IR engagement. Next we targeted the remaining canonical ERK sites in Sos.CT.VII and found when all are mutated there is a complete loss of ERK-induced phosphorylation in an in vitro kinase assay using purified active ERK. When expressed in CHO/IR cells we found also that in addition to decreased basal phosphorylation, insulin stimulation fails to induce a change in migration of either Sos.CT.VII or Sos.VII by SDS-PAGE. We were surprised to find, however, that stimulation of the IR still induces dissociation of Grb2 from a Sos construct containing the seven mutated ERK sites. This observation suggested that the mutant Sos protein may still be inducibly phosphorylated following IR ligation in CHO/IR cells. We demonstrated that this is the case in an experiment where CHO/IR cells transfected with either the wild type or mutant constructs were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and then left unstimulated or stimulated with insulin. As shown in Fig. 6although there is decreased phosphorylation of the VII mutant compared with the wild type molecule both basally and after IR engagement, the mutant molecule is still a substrate for an insulin-stimulated kinase(s). Collectively our data indicate that although ERK may be a physiological kinase for Sos in CHO/IR cells, it does not appear to be the relevant kinase for inducing the dissociation between Grb2 and Sos following IR engagement. It should be noted that Corbalan-Garcia et al. (9Corbalan-Garcia S. Yang S.S. Degenhardt K.R. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) have recently examined ERK phosphorylation sites within Sos that influence the mobility shift and affinity for Grb2. The results of their study suggested that the only critical residue in human Sos involved in the electrophoretic mobility shift is serine 1178 (which corresponds to serine 1181 in our murine construct). However, in our hands, mutation of this serine to valine does not affect the basal migration of Sos nor the insulin-induced mobility shift (data not shown). This observation underscores further our impression that the kinase(s) responsible for and sites of Sos phosphorylation depend on the cells being studied and the stimuli delivered. Thus, it appears that down-regulation of Ras via induced Sos phosphorylation is a complex process and is differentially regulated in various experimental systems. There also remains controversy regarding whether Sos phosphorylation and its dissociation from Grb2 affect the kinetics of Ras inactivation. Although our previous data suggest that a specific inhibitor of MEK which prevents Sos phosphorylation and disassembly of the Grb2·Sos complex prolongs insulin-induced Ras activation in CHO/IR cells (7Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.-J. Guan K.-L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1063-1068PubMed Google Scholar) found that inhibition of Sos phosphorylation and the dissociation of Grb2 from Sos by elevating cellular cAMP levels has no effect on the duration of insulin-induced Ras activation in rat L6 cells. One possible explanation for the discrepancy in results from the two studies may be differences in experimental protocol as well as cell type-specific regulation of Sos phosphorylation and mechanisms of Ras down-regulation. Thus, it is possible that increased cAMP may have effects that indirectly modulate Ras activation. Additionally, it should be noted that the kinetics of insulin-induced Ras activation in the two cell types differs significantly (Ras activity peaks at 1–3 min in CHO/IR cellsversus 15 min in rat L6 cells). Thus, mechanisms of insulin-dependent Ras activation as well as the importance of Sos phosphorylation leading to the disassembly of the Grb2·Sos complex may differ depending on what signal transduction cascades are activated and the cell type studied."

Although aberrant c-myc expression has been reported to play a role in multistage carcinogenesis in astrocytic gliomas, little is known about the effects of the expression of c-myc on oligodendrocytes. Using transgenic animals expressing a human c-myc oncogene under transcriptional control of the myelin basic protein gene, we investigated the effect of overexpression of this oncogene in oligodendrocytes. The MBP/c-myc transgenic mice developed severe neurological disturbances characterized by action tremors and recurrent seizures, and premature death during postnatal weeks three to five. Affected transgenic mice of various strains had severely hypomyelinated central nervous systems and expressed low levels of c-myc, myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) mRNAs in the brain. These c-myc transgenic mice also exhibited an increased number of TUNEL positive nuclei, which in most cases were located in cells that expressed c-myc, as judged by double immunohistochemistry. There was no evidence of brain tumors in the c-myc transgenic mice, including heterozygous mice from two strains that had normal lifespans. These observations indicate that the myelin deficiency observed in the MBP/c-myc transgenic animals results from a cytotoxic effect of the c-myc transgene."

The law must seek decisions that fall within the boundaries of scientifically sound decisions and approximately reflect the scientific state of the art. One means for this is the use of court-appointed scientific experts in technical cases to assist judges in gleaning unbiased information and determining the validity of scientific evidence."
