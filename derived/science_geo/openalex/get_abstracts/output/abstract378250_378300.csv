https://openalex.org/W1975356393,"Metabolic cofactors such as NADH and ATP play important roles in a large number of cellular reactions, and it is of great interest to dissect the role of these cofactors in different aspects of metabolism. Toward this goal, we overexpressed NADH oxidase and the soluble F1-ATPase in Escherichia coli to lower the level of NADH and ATP, respectively. We used a global interaction network, comprising of protein interactions, transcriptional regulation, and metabolic networks, to integrate data from transcription profiles, metabolic fluxes, and the metabolite levels. We identified high-scoring networks for the two strains. The results revealed a smaller, but denser network for perturbations of ATP level, compared with that of NADH level. The action of many global transcription factors such as ArcA, Fnr, CRP, and IHF commonly involved both NADH and ATP, whereas others responded to either ATP or NADH. Overexpressing NADH oxidase invokes response in widespread aspects of metabolism involving the redox cofactors (NADH and NADPH), whereas ATPase has a more focused response to restore ATP level by enhancing proton translocation mechanisms and repressing biosynthesis. Interestingly, NADPH played a key role in restoring redox homeostasis through the concerted activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase and UdhA transhydrogenase. We present a reconciled network of regulation that illustrates the overlapping and distinct aspects of metabolism controlled by NADH and ATP. Our study contributes to the general understanding of redox and energy metabolism and should help in developing metabolic engineering strategies in E. coli.

Our study contributes to the general understanding of redox and energy metabolism and should help in developing metabolic engineering strategies in E. coli. Microbial metabolic networks function in a coherent fashion to convert the available substrates into biomass and products. Often, intermediates of metabolism are not balanced with respect to their redox and/or energy content. Metabolic cofactors such as NADH and ATP serve in overcoming these constraints. Indeed, these cofactors rank among the most highly connected metabolites in the metabolic networks of most microorganisms (1Vemuri G.N. Aristidou A.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A direct consequence of this metabolic structure is that a small change in the concentration of these cofactors is likely to propagate to widespread aspects of metabolism. For example, the synthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleotides is energetically expensive and would drain cellular ATP and also require NADPH (2Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Schaechter M. Physiology of the Bacterial Cell: A Molecular Approach. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1990Google Scholar). ATP is primarily produced in the electron transport chain, which is fueled by NADH. NADH is produced in the catabolism, relating substrate utilization to biosynthesis and product formation. Therefore, these cofactors hold the potential to serve as targets for altering cellular metabolism. To achieve the desired metabolic changes, it is important to understand the metabolic processes that are specifically controlled by cofactors. NADPH primarily drives anabolic reactions, whereas NADH is the result of catabolism. To fulfill their distinct roles, these two redox couples are generally not in thermodynamic equilibrium. NADPH is primarily produced in the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway or by the isocitrate dehydrogenase in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) 2The abbreviations used are: TCAtricarboxylic acidMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidTFtranscription factorSFsigma factorHSNhigh scoring subnetworkPEPphosphoenolpyruvateOAAoxaloacetate. cycle. Many organisms also have a transhydrogenase that can interconvert NADH and NADPH, and some bacteria such as Escherichia coli rely more heavily than others on transhydrogenases for NADPH (3Fuhrer T. Sauer U. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 2112-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). tricarboxylic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid transcription factor sigma factor high scoring subnetwork phosphoenolpyruvate oxaloacetate. Because the cofactors are intimately connected with one another via the transhydrogenases or the oxidative phosphorylation, there is no clear distinction on the role of NADH and ATP in regulating metabolism. Increasing the intracellular level of NADH in E. coli increased acetate excretion accompanied with a shift in metabolism to produce typically fermentative products such as lactate and succinate even in the presence of ample oxygen (4Berríos-Rivera S.J. Bennett G.N. San K.Y. Metab. Eng. 2002; 4: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Berríos-Rivera S.J. Bennett G.N. San K.Y. Metab. Eng. 2002; 4: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The converse approach of lowering NADH level decreased acetate overflow (6Vemuri G.N. Altman E. Sangurdekar D.P. Khodursky A.B. Eiteman M.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 3653-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). On the contrary, acetate overflow increased when ATP level was lowered in E. coli (7Koebmann B.J. Westerhoff H.V. Snoep J.L. Nilsson D. Jensen P.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). These two approaches are of particular interest because they involve introducing heterologous enzymes that specifically decrease NADH or ATP concentrations. This is likely to invoke an unbiased response as opposed to affecting a specific metabolic reaction, which will have localized network effects around the altered reaction. Water-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus pneumonia was used to lower cellular NADH concentrations (6Vemuri G.N. Altman E. Sangurdekar D.P. Khodursky A.B. Eiteman M.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 3653-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), while the soluble F1 part of the F0F1-ATP synthase was used to specifically hydrolyze ATP (7Koebmann B.J. Westerhoff H.V. Snoep J.L. Nilsson D. Jensen P.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The predominant phenotype of E. coli harboring these enzymes shows an increased glycolytic flux at the expense of biomass production. Overexpression of NADH oxidase decreased acetate overflow whereas overexpression of the soluble ATPase increased acetate excretion. Transcription analysis in NADH oxidase overexpressed E. coli revealed elegant regulation governed by ArcA that brought about these changes (6Vemuri G.N. Altman E. Sangurdekar D.P. Khodursky A.B. Eiteman M.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 3653-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Many global transcription factors and two-component signal transduction systems in E. coli are triggered by redox or energy cofactors (8Hengge R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2008; 631: 40-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and yet, only few of these global transcription factors affect metabolic fluxes (9Perrenoud A. Sauer U. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3171-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). From a basic research point of view, there is a gap in our understanding of the influence of these transcriptional regulators on metabolism. The objective of this research is to determine the role of NADH and ATP in regulating metabolism. More specifically, we aim to map the overlap in the regulation and identify aspects of metabolism that are specifically controlled by NADH or ATP. Toward this goal, we quantified changes in metabolic fluxes in central carbon metabolism, the level of central carbon metabolites and cofactors and genome-wide transcription changes in response to overexpressing NADH oxidase or the soluble F1-ATPase subunit. We analyzed the response in the context of a global interaction map and identified metabolic modules that responded to the perturbations. The E. coli K12 strain, MG1655, was used as the reference strain in this study. All the strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. In this strain, NADH oxidase or the soluble ATPase were overexpressed using the nox gene from Streptococcus pneumoniae (GenBankTM entry AF014458) or the native atpAGD operon (encoding the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of the ATPase). The nox gene was amplified from the pTrc99A-nox plasmid (6Vemuri G.N. Altman E. Sangurdekar D.P. Khodursky A.B. Eiteman M.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 3653-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) using the forward primer containing the restriction site for XhoI (underlined), AGTTGGCTCGAGATGCNNNNNAGTTTATTCNTGACANNNNNNNNNNNNNNTGRTATAATNNNNCTGAAACAAACTGGAGACTGTCATGAGTAAAATCGTTGTAGTCGGTGC and the reverse primer containing the restriction site for XmaI (underlined), GTCAGTCCCGGGTTATTTTTCAGCCGTAAGGGCAG. The annealing portion of the gene is italicized. The forward primer consisted of varying spacer regions surrounding the consensus −35 and −10 regions of the promoter to vary the promoter strength (10Hammer K. Mijakovic I. Jensen P.R.

A library of promoters with varying strengths was constructed. These fragments were digested with XhoI and XmaI restriction enzymes and ligated into the pAK80 vector (13Israelsen H. Madsen S.M. Vrang A. Hansen E.B. Johansen E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2540-2547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was also subjected to restriction digest with the same enzymes. The pCP41 plasmid containing the atpAGD operon (7Koebmann B.J. Westerhoff H.V. Snoep J.L. Nilsson D. Jensen P.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which resulted in a moderate level of ATPase activity was used. The PCR was performed using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). The plasmids were introduced into E. coli MC1000 for screening. The plasmid that resulted in approximately the same reduction in growth rate as the pCP41 was selected for this study (pAC06). The presence of the genes was verified by an enzymatic assay as previously described (6Vemuri G.N. Altman E. Sangurdekar D.P. Khodursky A.B. Eiteman M.A. Appl. Environ.

The MG1655 strain was transformed with pAK80, pCP41 and pAC06 plasmids and the resulting strains are designated REF (containing empty vector), ATPase, and NOX, respectively.TABLE 1List of plasmids and strains used in this studyPlasmid/strainDescriptionSource/Ref.PlasmidspAK80Promoterless vector carrying the lacLM genes, ErmR(13Israelsen H.

Growth experiments were carried out in 500-ml baffled shakeflasks with a working volume of 100 ml at 37 °C in defined MOPS medium (14Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1% glucose and 200 μg/ml erythromycin. The flasks were agitated at 150 rpm to ensure aerobic conditions. Optical density was measured at 600 nm on a Shimadzu UV mini 1240 spectrophotometer. Promoters of different strengths were selected based on the extent of blue coloration on X-gal plates and quantified by a subsequent assay for β-galactosidase activity, as described previously (12Solem C. Jensen P.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). From this promoter library, a clone showing a similar decrease in the growth rate as the pCP41::atpAGD was selected for all further studies. The cultivations for quantification of intracellular fluxes were performed under identical conditions as described above using a mixture of 20% (wt/wt) [U-13C]glucose (>99% pure, Martek Biosciences, Columbia, MD) and 80% naturally labeled glucose. Samples from different stages of exponential growth were filtered through 0.2-μm filters and analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) containing a Bio-Rad HPX-87H column (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA). The mobile phase consisted of 5 mm H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and glucose, lactate, formate, and acetate were detected on the refractive index detector, RID-10A. Biomass samples for RNA extraction were taken from mid-exponential growth phase. An aliquot of 25 ml was chilled on ice, centrifuged at 5000 × g at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until subsequent analysis. Total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA) and quantified using a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop (NanoDrop products, Wilmington, DE). RNA quality was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Gene expression was analyzed using the Affymetrix platform with Affymetrix E. coli genome 2.0 chips according to the manufacturer's specification. Biomass samples for determining the fluxes were centrifuged (5000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C) and harvested in 150 μl of 6 m HCl and hydrolyzed at 105 °C for 24 h before drying at 85 °C. The hydrolyzate was dissolved in 50 μl of dimethyl formamide and derivatized using 30 μl of N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide. The mixture was incubated at 85 °C with shaking at 550 rpm for 60 min (Orbital Shaker CSA, Thermo Scientific) before GC-MS analysis, using previously described protocols (15Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 16Fischer E. Zamboni N. Sauer U. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 325: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). From the mass isotope distribution patterns of the proteinogenic amino acids, relative pathway contributions (metabolic flux ratios) were computed that were used as constraints to infer metabolic activity (15Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 16Fischer E. Zamboni N. Sauer U. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 325: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). An aliquot of 5 ml of the culture from mid-exponential phase was quenched in hot phenol (80 °C) and subsequently frozen at −20 °C for measuring the concentration of intracellular metabolites. The samples were processed as described previously (17Luo B. Groenke K. Takors R. Wandrey C. Oldiges M. J. Chromatogr. A. 2007; 1147: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and analyzed using LC-MS/MS for quantitative determination of central carbon metabolites and cofactors. The values were normalized with biomass concentrations at the time of sampling. All the transcriptome data used in this study can be obtained in the form of CEL files from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus using the accession number GSE20374. The raw data obtained in the form of the CEL files were subjected to preprocessing using median polish summarization. Background correction was performed using GCRMA (18Wu Z. Irizarry R.A. J. Comput. Biol. 2005; 12: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and the data were normalized by non-linear, quantile normalization using qspline (19Workman C. Jensen L.J. Jarmer H. Berka R. Gautier L. Nielser H.B. Saxild H.H. Nielsen C. Brunak S. Knudsen S. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (0048)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data obtained after preliminary processing were assessed for good reproducibility. Genes with log fold-changes for the expression of NOX and ATPase, which differed by a factor of two, relative to REF, were considered significantly changed (increased or decreased). The p value of their significance was calculated using Student's t test. The biological role of the significantly altered gene expressions was determined by using the biological process semantics maintained by the Gene Ontology Consortium. A hypergeometric distribution was used to determine the significant biological processes in different sets of genes. We also used datasets available in public repositories to validate our observations. The context of the datasets and their accession numbers is presented in the S6 section of the supplemental text. The transcriptional regulatory network of E. coli was constructed using information from the RegulonDB database (20Gama-Castro S. Jiménez-Jacinto V. Peralta-Gil M. Santos-Zavaleta A. Peñaloza-Spinola M.I. Contreras-Moreira B. Segura-Salazar J. Muñiz-Rascado L. Martínez-Flores I. Salgado H. Bonavides-Martinez C. Abreu-Goodger C. Rodriguez-Penagos C. Miranda-Ríos J. Morett E. Merino E. Huerta A.M. Treviño-Quintanilla L. Collado-Vides J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D120-D124Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), which documents the known regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and sigma factors (SFs) with genes. The amount of regulation exerted by each TF or SF was quantified as a p value that was calculated as described (21Oliveira A.P. Patil K.R. Nielsen J. BMC Syst. Biol. 2008; 2: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These algorithms take into account the significance of the expression of genes regulated by the different TFs and SFs. The regulators are scored after normalizing with the background (rest of the genes), and the probability that their influence is different from the background is calculated. Those TFs and SFs whose p value is less than 0.05 in either NOX or ATPase are considered in this study. To identify the most affected nodes in the metabolic network, we used the genome-scale metabolic network of E. coli (22Reed J.L. Vo T.D. Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and overlaid the p values of the genes which encode for the enzymes that catalyze the different reactions in the model. Using a similar algorithm (23Patil K.R. Nielsen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2685-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), metabolites around which significant transcriptional activity in their network neighborhood were identified. A protein interaction network of E. coli was constructed by combining data from high throughput TAP-tag pull-down experiments (24Hu P. Janga S.C. Babu M. Díaz-Mejía J.J. Butland G. Yang W.

A global interaction map in E. coli was constructed by overlaying the transcriptional regulatory network and the protein interaction network on the genome-scale metabolic network. This network resulted in 4936 cellular components with 18943 interactions, and is available in mark-up language format as a supplemental file. High-scoring networks (HSNs) within the global interaction map were identified using simulated annealing by invoking the jactivemodules algorithm (28Ideker T. Ozier O. Schwikowski B. Siegel A.F. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: S233-S240Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) using the default parameters in a Cytoscape environment (29Killcoyne S. Carter G.W. Smith J. Boyle J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 563: 219-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which was also used for visualization. We decreased the level of NADH or ATP in E. coli to dissect the regulatory effects of these cofactors on metabolism. We used water-forming NADH oxidase and the soluble F1-ATPase to effect the perturbation. The net reactions mediated by these enzymes are given in Reaction 1. Soluble F1‐ATPase:ATP→ADP+PiNADH oxidase:NADH+(1/2)O2→NAD++H2OREACTION 1 This strategy is expected to invoke an unbiased response, in contrast to deleting or overexpressing metabolic pathways directly involved in cofactor utilization, which may result in localized changes in fluxes surrounding the reaction. The strains of E. coli in which the heterologous genes are expressed are referred to as ATPase or NOX for convenience. The physiological changes we observed in response to overexpressing NADH oxidase or the soluble ATPase appeared to be geared to restoring the redox or energy balance, respectively. The dominant phenotype that was common to NOX and ATPase strains was increased glucose uptake by 27 and 70%, respectively (Table 2). The specific growth rate decreased in NOX and ATPase strains by 10 and 20%, respectively. The biomass yield also decreased substantially in the NOX strain (33%) and ATPase (49%) strains relative to the reference strain (see section S1 in supplemental text for growth profiles). This interesting behavior of consuming glucose faster, but channeling it away from biomass was shared by both NOX and ATPase strains. Acetate production rate increased 3-fold in ATPase, relative to the reference strain, whereas it decreased by 40% in NOX compared with the reference strain (Table 2).TABLE 2Growth and physiological parameters of the three strains used in this studyStrainμaMaximum specific growth rate (h−1).YSXbBiomass yield from glucose (g dry cell weight/g glucose).rScSpecific glucose uptake rate (mmol/g dry cell weight (DCW) h).rAdSpecific acetate production rate (mmol/d DCW h).REF0.72 ± 0.010.43 ± 0.029.2 ± 0.115.52 ± 0.86NOX0.65 ± 0.020.29 ± 0.0311.7 ± 0.213.28 ± 0.33ATPase0.58 ± 0.010.22 ± 0.0015.6 ± 0.1916.69 ± 1.01a Maximum specific growth rate (h−1).b Biomass yield from glucose (g dry cell weight/g glucose).c Specific glucose uptake rate (mmol/g dry cell weight (DCW) h).d Specific acetate production rate (mmol/d DCW h). Open table in a new tab To elucidate the impact of decreasing NADH or ATP level, we obtained flux distribution in the central carbon metabolism in the reference, NOX and ATPase strains. We normalized the fluxes to the specific rate of glucose uptake and present relative flux values (Fig. 1). The values of absolute and relative fluxes are provided in section S2 in the supplemental text. Increased glucose uptake in the mutant strains resulted in a higher flux in the glycolytic pathway. This phenotype is more prominent in ATPase strain (30%) than in NOX (12%). Concomitantly the relative flux in the pentose phosphate pathway decreased. Faster operation of glycolysis triggered related changes in the entire central carbon metabolism, which manifested in flux redistribution around key branch points, such as PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate) and pyruvate. The anaplerotic flux via PEP carboxylase decreased by 21% only in the NOX strain, whereas it remained unaffected in the ATPase strain. Interestingly, the relative flux in the reverse reaction, catalyzed by PEP carboxykinase, increased in the ATPase strain by 40%, but decreased by 27% in the NOX strain (Fig. 1). At the pyruvate branch point, the relative flux of the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction (from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA) increased by 45% in the ATPase strain while it remained relatively unchanged in the NOX strain. Consistent with the physiological results, 72% of this flux was channeled into acetate overflow in the ATPase strain. Acetate overflow decreased by 53% in the NOX strain while it increased by 78% in the ATPase strain. Interestingly, we detected a small amount of anaplerotic flux via malic enzyme (from malate to pyruvate) only in the NOX strain, while it was absent in the reference and ATPase strains. In comparison to REF, the relative TCA cycle flux increased by 78% in NOX while it increased only 21% in ATPase. Higher glycolytic flux (relative to REF) was transmitted to the TCA cycle only in NOX, whereas it was excreted as acetate in ATPase. The perturbations to reduce the level of NADH and ATP also resulted in a remarkable increase in the transhydrogenase flux, to produce NADH from NADPH. In comparison with REF, the relative transhydrogenase flux increased over 6-fold in NOX and over 5-fold in ATPase (Fig. 1). The nature of the analysis technique also allows quantifying the origin of key metabolic intermediates such as PEP and pyruvate under the conditions studied. Based on the measurements, we calculated that about 22% of PEP in REF originated from oxaloacetate (OAA) via the PEP carboxykinase. In NOX, only 18% of PEP originated from OAA, but in ATPase, 33% of PEP originated from OAA. The remainder of PEP is derived from pentoses. This result is coherent with the decrease in the pentose phosphate flux in ATPase. We also observed substantial changes in the origin of OAA from PEP via the reverse reaction, PEP carboxylase. Relative to the REF, NOX produced 35% less OAA from PEP whereas ATPase produced 15% less (Fig. 2). The higher glycolytic flux in NOX and ATPase translated into a higher contribution to the production of serine by 9% in NOX and by 24% in ATPase, compared with REF. Information on the origin of metabolic intermediates indicates the degree of utilization of the different pathways, and provides critical insight into regulation prevalent at the flux level. Detailed information on the drain of precursors to biomass is shown in section S2 in the supplemental text. We measured the intracellular concentration of the central carbon metabolites and cofactors under identical conditions at which metabolic fluxes were measured. Principal component analysis separated NOX and ATPase strains from REF (see section S3 in supplemental text). The first principal component (PC1) accounted for 79% of the variance, whereas PC2 accounted for 11% of the variance. PC1 distinctly separated NOX and ATPase from REF. Given the high amount of variance that PC1 accounts for, the result indicates that the levels of the central carbon intermediates are in NOX and ATPase significantly different from that in REF. PC2 separated the strains in opposing directions from REF. The concentration of the glycolytic metabolites and TCA cycle intermediates was higher in ATPase than in NOX. A notable exception was in the concentration of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), which was present at a higher concentration in NOX. The concentration of the pentose phosphates was lower in ATPase and NOX, compared with REF. The key metabolites at the divergence of metabolism from glucose oxidation to fermentation of glucose, pyruvate (PYR), and acetyl-CoA were substantially higher in ATPase than in NOX (supplemental text S3). The concentration of NAD+ doubled upon overexpressing NADH oxidase, whereas it remained unaffected in ATPase. The concentration of NADH decreased by a factor of 7 in NOX, relative to REF, while it remained unchanged in ATPase. Overex"

We have determined the conformation of the ECL2 of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor by reporter-cysteine accessibility mapping in different receptor states (i.e. empty, agonist-bound and antagonist-bound). We introduced cysteines at each position of ECL2 of an N-terminal epitope-tagged receptor surrogate lacking all non-essential cysteines and then measured reaction of these with a cysteine-reactive biotin probe. The ability of biotinylated mutant receptors to react with a steptavidin-HRP-conjugated antibody was used as the basis for examining differences in accessibility. Two segments of ECL2 were accessible in the empty receptor, indicating an open conformation of ECL2. These segments were inaccessible in the ligand-bound states of the receptor. Using the accessibility constraint, we performed molecular dynamics simulation to predict ECL2 conformation in different states of the receptor. Analysis suggested that a lid conformation similar to that of ECL2 in rhodopsin was induced upon binding both agonist and antagonist, but exposing different accessible segments delimited by the highly conserved disulfide bond. Our study reveals the ability of ECL2 to interact with diffusing ligands and to adopt a ligand-specific lid conformation, thus, slowing down dissociation of ligands when bound. Distinct conformations induced by the bound agonist and the antagonist around the conserved disulfide bond suggest an important role for this disulfide bond in producing different functional states of the receptor.

The cellular reaction was localized almost exclusively to the red pulp, especially after the injection of living Salmonella typhi (about 500 millions/kgm.). The spleen was investigated by means of biopsies at intervals during antibody formation ; differential counts of imprints were made and histological sections were examined. The stain used was methyl green pyronine (Unna–Pappenheim). In the earliest stages of the reaction, in the first phase of antibody formation, large reticulum cells of characteristic appearance (called transitional cells) presented themselves. One or two days later, immature plasma cells appeared at the places where transitional cells were previously found, and after a further few days mature plasma cells were seen in increasing noimbers. There were numerous transitions between the different stages of development. No plasma cells were usually seen in the lymph follicles."

Recent studies suggest that ChoK is implicated in tumorigenesis and emerging as an attractive target for anticancer chemotherapy.

In both structures, HC-3 bound at the conserved hydrophobic groove on the C-terminal lobe. One of the HC-3 oxazinium rings complexed with ChoKα1 occupied the choline-binding pocket, providing a structural explanation for its inhibitory action. Interestingly, the HC-3 molecule co-crystallized with ChoKβ was phosphorylated in the choline binding site.

Although opinions differ as to the precise mechanism of hydrothermal shrinkage, the phenomenon is generally agreed to be a cumulative effect in which the polypeptide chains, by the rupture of certain cross-links of various strengths, assume a more compact space arrangement than their hitherto extended forms. On drying in this compact state, their ability to take up water is considerably reduced, due probably to the formation of fresh inter-chain links."

Like Prof. Le Gros Clark3, I am now convinced, on the evidence submitted by Dr. Robert Broom4, that Prof. Dart was right and that I was wrong ; the Australopithecinæ are in or near the line which culminated in the human form. My only complaint now is the length of the name which the extinct anthropoid of South Africa must for ever bear. Seeing that Prof. Dart not only discovered them but also rightly perceived their true nature, I have ventured, when writing of the Australopithecinæ, to give them the colloquial name of 'Dartians', thereby saving much expenditure of ink and of print. The Dartians are ground-living anthropoids, human in posture, gait and dentition, but still anthropoid in facial physiognomy and in size of brain. It is much easier to say there was a 'Dartian' phase in man's evolution than to speak of one which was 'australopithecine'."

IntroductionThe ING family members are well known candidate tumor growth suppressors (1He G.H. Helbing C.C. Wagner M.J. Sensen C.W. Riabowol K. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). They are associated with certain areas of oncogenesis and cellular growth, such as cell cycle regulation, senescence, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis (2Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Cell. 2007; 128: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). Reduced mRNA expression, allelic loss, or somatic mutation of ING proteins were reported in many types of human cancers, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, melanoma, glioma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (2Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Cell. 2007; 128: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms of ING proteins are still poorly understood.The DNA damage response process is very important for all living things to defeat the continuous threat of DNA damage caused by endogenous and exogenous factors and to maintain genome integrity (3Zharkov D.O. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1544-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA in the eukaryotic nucleus is packaged into a very compact structure, and a critical step in DNA repair is to ensure that the DNA repair machinery can access the DNA. ING proteins always act as co-factors of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 3The abbreviations used are: HAThistone acetyltransferaseMST1MYST family histone acetyltransferase 1MMSmethylmethane sulfonateCPTcamptothecinHDAChistone deacetylaseNuA4nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4HCS13-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinWTwild typeChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation. or histone deacetylases (HDACs) to acetylate or deacetylate the N-terminal tail of histone proteins (4Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar, 5Saksouk N. Avvakumov N. Côté J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This process can promote or inhibit access of DNA repair or gene transcription machinery to the DNA and is involved in DNA repair, gene transcription, and genome integrity (6Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 7Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y.

Thus far, five human members (INGs1–5) and three budding yeast members (Yng1p, Yng2p, and Pho23p) have been characterized, and they all function with HATs or HDACs (8Shi X. Gozani O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 96: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Among these members, human ING3 is a stable component of the NuA4 HAT complex and functions in the DNA damage response pathway through regulation of histone H4/H2A acetylation or deacetylation (7Ikura T.

The three budding yeast ING family proteins, Yng1p, Yng2p, and Pho23p, are subunits of the NuA3 HAT, NuA4 HAT, and Sin3/Rpd3 HDAC complexes, respectively. They regulate H3 acetylation, H4 acetylation, and histone deacetylation, respectively (10Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell.

Each of these ING family proteins contain an N-terminal protein-protein interaction region, a nuclear localization signal, and a C-terminal plant homeodomain finger (1He G.H. Helbing C.C. Wagner M.J.

Cell Res. 2006; 312: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The most conserved motif, plant homeodomain, always functions as a histone code-signaling domain that recognizes the trimethylated lysine 4 residue of histone H3 (H3K4me3) to sense upstream signals (14Wysocka J.

However, the downstream pathway of histone code transduction by ING proteins still needs to be investigated.Fission yeast is an ideal system to study the molecular mechanisms of the DNA damage response. However, the biological functions of fission yeast ING family proteins Png1p and Png2p are poorly defined. In 2007, Grewal's laboratory (18Nicolas E. Yamada T. Cam H.P. Fitzgerald P.C. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) found that Png2p functions as a component of the Clr6 HDAC complex, and cells with deletion of PNG2 were insensitive to DNA damage, suggesting that Png2p is likely not involved in the DNA damage response. In previous bioinformatics reports, the other ING family protein Png1p in fission yeast was closely related to Yng2p, an ING family protein in budding yeast involved in the response to DNA damage (1He G.H. Helbing C.C. Wagner M.J. Sensen C.W. Riabowol K. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Choy J.S. Kron S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8215-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These reports prompted us to address whether Png1p conserves function in the DNA damage response similar to Yng2p and to determine the downstream pathway. In the present study, we found that Png1p is required for cell growth under normal and DNA-damaged conditions. The Png1p protein is required for histone H4 acetylation in vivo. Decreased acetylation in png1 mutants resulted in decreased expression of 756 open reading frames related to chromatin remodeling, the cell cycle, and DNA repair, including the central DNA repair gene RAD22. Furthermore, down-regulation of Rad22 was attributable to decreased H4 acetylation. Overexpression of RAD22 in Δpng1 mutants partially rescued the defective phenotype under normal and DNA-damaged conditions. Our results indicate that fission yeast Png1p is required for H4 acetylation and functions upstream of Rad22 in the DNA damage response pathway.DISCUSSIONING family members are conserved proteins in different types of eukaryotic cells (1He G.H. Helbing C.C. Wagner M.J. Sensen C.W. Riabowol K. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Shi X. Gozani O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 96: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the phenotype of the fission yeast Δpng1 was similar to that of the budding yeast Δyng2, but their molecular mechanisms were not completely the same. In the phenotype study, we found that Png1p is essential for cell growth under normal and DNA-damaged conditions (Fig. 1), which parallels Yng2p in budding yeast (19Choy J.S. Kron S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8215-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism study showed that Png1p collaborates with the histone acetyltransferase Mst1p/KAT5 and is essential for global histone H4 acetylation in vivo, which is similar to the functions of Yng2p in budding yeast (19Choy J.S. Kron S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8215-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Choy J.S. Tobe B.T. Huh J.H. Kron S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43653-43662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Additionally, PNG1 and YNG2 are functional homolog genes in the DNA damage response pathway, reflected by the results of the complementation assay (Fig. 2, A and B). However, we also found differences between the molecular mechanisms of Png1p and Yng2p. Contrary to a previous report showing that Yng2p localizes in the nucleus (35Choy J.S. Tobe B.T. Huh J.H.

The different localizations of Png1 and Yng2 suggest differences between their physiological functions. Png1p might function not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the analysis of genome-wide gene expression using a DNA microarray showed that 756 open reading frames are down-regulated at least 2-fold in Δpng1 mutants (Table 2). These down-regulated genes contain the cell division-related genes ENG1 and AGN1 (36Martín-Cuadrado A.B. Dueñas E. Sipiczki M. Vázquezde Aldana C.R. del Rey F. J.

Tobe B.T. Huh J.H. Kron S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43653-43662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which did not find gene expression changes between budding yeast WT and Δyng2 mutant.The DNA recombination protein Rad22 is well known to play an important role in promoting S phase completion and acts as the central protein in repair of DNA double-strand breaks (42Kim W.J.

Rad22 can directly bind to the end of linear duplex DNA to protect DNA from exonuclease digestion in vitro and is essential for the formation of the DNA repair complex (42Kim W.J. Lee S. Park M.S. Jang Y.K. Kim J.B. Park S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35607-35611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 43Ostermann K. Lorentz A. Schmidt H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5940-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although the functions of Rad22 have been thoroughly studied, the mechanisms underlying regulation of Rad22 expression are less well known. In the present study, we showed that Δpng1 cells exhibited extreme sensitivity to DNA damage and intra-S phase cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1), similar to rad22 deletion cells (44Doe C.L. Osman F. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5570-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rad22 provides partial suppression of the growth defect and DNA damage sensitivity of png1 deletion (Fig. 5A). We also found that expression of Rad22 is positively correlated to Png1-involved histone H4 acetylation at the Rad22 promoter (Fig. 5, B and D). These results demonstrate that both Png1p and Rad22 are responsible for DNA damage in the same pathway through intra-S phase cell cycle arrest. Png1p facilitated Mst1 to acetylate H4 at the Rad22 promoter and regulated Rad22 expression. Thus, Png1p is involved in H4 acetylation and acts upstream of Rad22. Considering that Rad22 and ING orthologs are conserved from yeast to human (43Ostermann K. Lorentz A. Schmidt H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5940-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), upstream and downstream relationships between Png1 and Rad22 in the fission yeast system suggest that this relationship also probably exists in other organisms, especially in human cells and budding yeast. However, this hypothesis needs to be explored further in different eukaryotic cells.In the present study, we also found that fission yeast Mst1p can rescue budding yeast esa1-1851ts mutants, suggesting that Mst1p may function in histone acetylation, similar to Esa1 in budding yeast. The NuA4 complexes of ScEsa1 and hTip60 have been identified in budding yeast and mammalian cells, but the complex of Mst1p in fission yeast has not. The actin-related protein Alp5 is a component of the Mst1p HAT complex (45Minoda A. Saitoh S. Takahashi K. Toda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, associations between Png1p and Mst1 in vitro and in vivo suggest that Png1 is also a component of the Mst1p complex (Fig. 3, B and C). Identifying the Mst1p-formed HAT complex that is responsible for histone acetylation, similar to the NuA4 complex in budding yeast and humans, will be interesting. Further functional research regarding Mst1p and its complex will provide deeper insights into how this conserved protein affects chromatin remodeling and subsequent gene expression.In summary, we used Schizosaccharomyces pombe to investigate the role of Png1, one member of the ING family. Png1 is required for cell growth under normal and DNA-damaged conditions. Png1 was shown to be associated with acetyltransferase Mst1 by co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence localization and to be a functional ortholog of S. cerevisiae Yng2 (a component of the NuA4 HAT complex) by complementation testing. Deletion of Png1 led to reduced acetylation of histone H4 and down-regulation of 756 genes containing Rad22, which are critical for double-strand break repair. Overexpression of Rad22 partially suppressed the growth defects and DNA damage sensitivity caused by png1 deletion. ChIP assays further demonstrated that H4 acetylation at the Rad22 promoter is lacking or drastically reduced in Δpng1 cells, and Mst1 is localized to the Rad22 promoter. These results suggest that Png1p facilitates Mst1 to acetylate H4 at the Rad22 promoter and regulates the expression of Rad22. In summary, Png1 is involved in H4 acetylation and acts upstream of Rad22. IntroductionThe ING family members are well known candidate tumor growth suppressors (1He G.H. Helbing C.C. Wagner M.J. Sensen C.W. Riabowol K. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). They are associated with certain areas of oncogenesis and cellular growth, such as cell cycle regulation, senescence, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis (2Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Cell. 2007; 128: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). Reduced mRNA expression, allelic loss, or somatic mutation of ING proteins were reported in many types of human cancers, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, melanoma, glioma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (2Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Cell. 2007; 128: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms of ING proteins are still poorly understood.The DNA damage response process is very important for all living things to defeat the continuous threat of DNA damage caused by endogenous and exogenous factors and to maintain genome integrity (3Zharkov D.O. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1544-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA in the eukaryotic nucleus is packaged into a very compact structure, and a critical step in DNA repair is to ensure that the DNA repair machinery can access the DNA. ING proteins always act as co-factors of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 3The abbreviations used are: HAThistone acetyltransferaseMST1MYST family histone acetyltransferase 1MMSmethylmethane sulfonateCPTcamptothecinHDAChistone deacetylaseNuA4nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4HCS13-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinWTwild typeChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation. or histone deacetylases (HDACs) to acetylate or deacetylate the N-terminal tail of histone proteins (4Jenuwein T.

This process can promote or inhibit access of DNA repair or gene transcription machinery to the DNA and is involved in DNA repair, gene transcription, and genome integrity (6Struhl K.

Thus far, five human members (INGs1–5) and three budding yeast members (Yng1p, Yng2p, and Pho23p) have been characterized, and they all function with HATs or HDACs (8Shi X. Gozani O. J. Cell.

Among these members, human ING3 is a stable component of the NuA4 HAT complex and functions in the DNA damage response pathway through regulation of histone H4/H2A acetylation or deacetylation (7Ikura T.

The three budding yeast ING family proteins, Yng1p, Yng2p, and Pho23p, are subunits of the NuA3 HAT, NuA4 HAT, and Sin3/Rpd3 HDAC complexes, respectively.

Each of these ING family proteins contain an N-terminal protein-protein interaction region, a nuclear localization signal, and a C-terminal plant homeodomain finger (1He G.H. Helbing C.C. Wagner M.J.

However, the downstream pathway of histone code transduction by ING proteins still needs to be investigated.Fission yeast is an ideal system to study the molecular mechanisms of the DNA damage response. However, the biological functions of fission yeast ING family proteins Png1p and Png2p are poorly defined. In 2007, Grewal's laboratory (18Nicolas E. Yamada T. Cam H.P. Fitzgerald P.C. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) found that Png2p functions as a component of the Clr6 HDAC complex, and cells with deletion of PNG2 were insensitive to DNA damage, suggesting that Png2p is likely not involved in the DNA damage response. In previous bioinformatics reports, the other ING family protein Png1p in fission yeast was closely related to Yng2p, an ING family protein in budding yeast involved in the response to DNA damage (1He G.H. Helbing C.C. Wagner M.J. Sensen C.W. Riabowol K. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Choy J.S. Kron S.J. Mol. Cell.

These reports prompted us to address whether Png1p conserves function in the DNA damage response similar to Yng2p and to determine the downstream pathway. In the present study, we found that Png1p is required for cell growth under normal and DNA-damaged conditions. The Png1p protein is required for histone H4 acetylation in vivo. Decreased acetylation in png1 mutants resulted in decreased expression of 756 open reading frames related to chromatin remodeling, the cell cycle, and DNA repair, including the central DNA repair gene RAD22. Furthermore, down-regulation of Rad22 was attributable to decreased H4 acetylation. Overexpression of RAD22 in Δpng1 mutants partially rescued the defective phenotype under normal and DNA-damaged conditions. Our results indicate that fission yeast Png1p is required for H4 acetylation and functions upstream of Rad22 in the DNA damage response pathway.

In the present study, we found that the phenotype of the fission yeast Δpng1 was similar to that of the budding yeast Δyng2, but their molecular mechanisms were not completely the same.

Biol. 2008; 15: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and DNA damage repair-related gene RAD22 (Table 2 and Fig. 4). These results are opposite to the report of Choy et al. (35Choy J.S. Tobe B.T. Huh J.H. Kron S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43653-43662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which did not find gene expression changes between budding yeast WT and Δyng2 mutant.The DNA recombination protein Rad22 is well known to play an important role in promoting S phase completion and acts as the central protein in repair of DNA double-strand breaks (42Kim W.J.

Rad22 can directly bind to the end of linear duplex DNA to protect DNA from exonuclease digestion in vitro and is essential for the formation of the DNA repair complex (42Kim W.J. Lee S. Park M.S. Jang Y.K. Kim J.B. Park S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35607-35611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 43Ostermann K. Lorentz A. Schmidt H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5940-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although the functions of Rad22 have been thoroughly studied, the mechanisms underlying regulation of Rad22 expression are less well known. In the present study, we showed that Δpng1 cells exhibited extreme sensitivity to DNA damage and intra-S phase cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1), similar to rad22 deletion cells (44Doe C.L. Osman F. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5570-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rad22 provides partial suppression of the growth defect and DNA damage sensitivity of png1 deletion (Fig. 5A). We also found that expression of Rad22 is positively correlated to Png1-involved histone H4 acetylation at the Rad22 promoter (Fig. 5, B and D). These results demonstrate that both Png1p and Rad22 are responsible for DNA damage in the same pathway through intra-S phase cell cycle arrest. Png1p facilitated Mst1 to acetylate H4 at the Rad22 promoter and regulated Rad22 expression. Thus, Png1p is involved in H4 acetylation and acts upstream of Rad22. Considering that Rad22 and ING orthologs are conserved from yeast to human (43Ostermann K. Lorentz A. Schmidt H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5940-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), upstream and downstream relationships between Png1 and Rad22 in the fission yeast system suggest that this relationship also probably exists in other organisms, especially in human cells and budding yeast. However, this hypothesis needs to be explored further in different eukaryotic cells.In the present study, we also found that fission yeast Mst1p can rescue budding yeast esa1-1851ts mutants, suggesting that Mst1p may function in histone acetylation, similar to Esa1 in budding yeast. The NuA4 complexes of ScEsa1 and hTip60 have been identified in budding yeast and mammalian cells, but the complex of Mst1p in fission yeast has not. The actin-related protein Alp5 is a component of the Mst1p HAT complex (45Minoda A. Saitoh S. Takahashi K. Toda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, associations between Png1p and Mst1 in vitro and in vivo suggest that Png1 is also a component of the Mst1p complex (Fig. 3, B and C). Identifying the Mst1p-formed HAT complex that is responsible for histone acetylation, similar to the NuA4 complex in budding yeast and humans, will be interesting. Further functional research regarding Mst1p and its complex will provide deeper insights into how this conserved protein affects chromatin remodeling and subsequent gene expression.In summary, we used Schizosaccharomyces pombe to investigate the role of Png1, one member of the ING family. Png1 is required for cell growth under normal and DNA-damaged conditions. Png1 was shown to be associated with acetyltransferase Mst1 by co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence localization and to be a functional ortholog of S. cerevisiae Yng2 (a component of the NuA4 HAT complex) by complementation testing. Deletion of Png1 led to reduced acetylation of histone H4 and down-regulation of 756 genes containing Rad22, which are critical for double-strand break repair. Overexpression of Rad22 partially suppressed the growth defects and DNA damage sensitivity caused by png1 deletion. ChIP assays further demonstrated that H4 acetylation at the Rad22 promoter is lacking or drastically reduced in Δpng1 cells, and Mst1 is localized to the Rad22 promoter. These results suggest that Png1p facilitates Mst1 to acetylate H4 at the Rad22 promoter and regulates the expression of Rad22. In summary, Png1 is involved in H4 acetylation and acts upstream of Rad22. ING family members are conserved proteins in different types of eukaryotic cells (1He G.H. Helbing C.C. Wagner M.J. Sensen C.W. Riabowol K. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Shi X. Gozani O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 96: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the phenotype of the fission yeast Δpng1 was similar to that of the budding yeast Δyng2, but their molecular mechanisms were not completely the same. In the phenotype study, we found that Png1p is essential for cell growth under normal and DNA-damaged conditions (Fig. 1), which parallels Yng2p in budding yeast (19Choy J.S. Kron S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8215-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism study showed that Png1p collaborates with the histone acetyltransferase Mst1p/KAT5 and is essential for global histone H4 acetylation in vivo, which is similar to the functions of Yng2p in budding yeast (19Choy J.S. Kron S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8215-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Choy J.S. Tobe B.T. Huh J.H. Kron S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43653-43662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Additionally, PNG1 and YNG2 are functional homolog genes in the DNA damage response pathway, reflected by the results of the complementation assay (Fig. 2, A and B). However, we also found differences between the molecular mechanisms of Png1p and Yng2p. Contrary to a previous report showing that Yng2p localizes in the nucleus (35Choy J.S. Tobe B.T. Huh J.H. Kron S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43653-43662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we found that Png1p did not function exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 2B). The different localizations of Png1 and Yng2 suggest differences between their physiological functions. Png1p might function not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the analysis of genome-wide gene expression using a DNA microarray showed that 756 open reading frames are down-regulated at least 2-fold in Δpng1 mutants (Table 2). These down-regulated genes contain the cell division-related genes ENG1 and AGN1 (36Martín-Cuadrado A.B. Dueñas E. Sipiczki M. Vázquezde Aldana C.R. del Rey F. J.

There have been considerable differences of opinion, first as to the possibility of recognizing natural hybrids and, secondly, as to the status of the parents once the possibility of hybridization has been established. We are not concerned here with the second controversy, for it must be recognized, now, that the existence of hybrids both within and between species is well substantiated. Although hybrids are one of the banes of the taxonomist, their frequent occurrence in Nature makes it important that they should be recognizable without doubt.

https://openalex.org/W1975323374,"IT seems desirable to utter a caveat in reference to Dr. S. H. Wajda's communication on the origin of erythrocytes from striated muscle1. During the last two years, many hundreds of sections of muscles previously traumatized by various means have been studied in great detail in this Department. In view of the suggestion often made in the past (and particularly in view of the recent work of Chevremont) special search has been made for convincing evidence of the transformation of muscle fibres into various types of connective tissue cells. Unfortunately, the histological picture is usually extremely confused in the traumatized area at first and, unless the sections are studied with a critical eye, it is possible to mistake histiocytic and other phagocytic elements for actual transitional forms between disintegrating muscle cells and various connective tissue cells. Because of these difficulties, it has been reluctantly concluded that this type of material is really not adequate for the solution of such a problem. In some cases it can be certainly demonstrated that the appearance seen under the microscope suggesting a transformation of a muscle fibre into histiocytes is quite illusory (although, of course, this does not preclude such a possibility)."
